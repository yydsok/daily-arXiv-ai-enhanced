### [1] [A Survey of Task-Oriented Knowledge Graph Reasoning: Status, Applications, and Prospects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11012)
*Guanglin Niu,Bo Li,Yangguang Lin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文综述了知识图谱推理（KGR）的研究现状，系统分类了六种KGR任务，并探讨了其下游应用和挑战性推理范式，同时分析了LLM等先进技术对KGR的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有综述未全面涵盖KGR任务，尤其是下游应用和挑战性推理范式，因此需要更系统的总结。

Method: 基于任务分类（静态单步、静态多步、动态、多模态、少样本和归纳KGR），结合下游应用和挑战性任务，分析KGR研究。

Result: 提出了更全面的KGR研究视角，并探讨了LLM等技术的潜在影响。

Conclusion: 该综述为KGR领域的研究趋势和未来方向提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for structuring
and leveraging diverse real-world knowledge, which serve as a fundamental
technology for enabling cognitive intelligence systems with advanced
understanding and reasoning capabilities. Knowledge graph reasoning (KGR) aims
to infer new knowledge based on existing facts in KGs, playing a crucial role
in applications such as public security intelligence, intelligent healthcare,
and financial risk assessment. From a task-centric perspective, existing KGR
approaches can be broadly classified into static single-step KGR, static
multi-step KGR, dynamic KGR, multi-modal KGR, few-shot KGR, and inductive KGR.
While existing surveys have covered these six types of KGR tasks, a
comprehensive review that systematically summarizes all KGR tasks particularly
including downstream applications and more challenging reasoning paradigms
remains lacking. In contrast to previous works, this survey provides a more
comprehensive perspective on the research of KGR by categorizing approaches
based on primary reasoning tasks, downstream application tasks, and potential
challenging reasoning tasks. Besides, we explore advanced techniques, such as
large language models (LLMs), and their impact on KGR. This work aims to
highlight key research trends and outline promising future directions in the
field of KGR.

### [2] [OntoGSN: An Ontology for Dynamic Management of Assurance Cases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11023)
*Tomas Bueno Momcilovic,Barbara Gallina,Ingmar Kessler,Dian Balta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OntoGSN是一个基于GSN标准的本体和中间件，用于管理保证案例（ACs），提供知识表示和可查询图，支持自动填充、评估和更新。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 管理保证案例（ACs）在动态环境中具有挑战性，现有工具难以维护嵌入的知识，导致开发效率低下或虚假信心。

Method: 提出OntoGSN，包括GSN标准的OWL本体、辅助本体和解析器、SPARQL查询库、原型界面等。

Result: OntoGSN严格遵循GSN标准，并通过FAIR原则、OOPS框架、能力问题和社区反馈评估。

Conclusion: OntoGSN有效支持动态AC管理，并在大型语言模型的对抗鲁棒性案例中验证了其实用性。

Abstract: Assurance cases (ACs) are a common artifact for building and maintaining
confidence in system properties such as safety or robustness. Constructing an
AC can be challenging, although existing tools provide support in static,
document-centric applications and methods for dynamic contexts (e.g.,
autonomous driving) are emerging. Unfortunately, managing ACs remains a
challenge, since maintaining the embedded knowledge in the face of changes
requires substantial effort, in the process deterring developers - or worse,
producing poorly managed cases that instill false confidence. To address this,
we present OntoGSN: an ontology and supporting middleware for managing ACs in
the Goal Structuring Notation (GSN) standard. OntoGSN offers a knowledge
representation and a queryable graph that can be automatically populated,
evaluated, and updated. Our contributions include: a 1:1 formalization of the
GSN Community Standard v3 in an OWL ontology with SWRL rules; a helper ontology
and parser for integration with a widely used AC tool; a repository and
documentation of design decisions for OntoGSN maintenance; a SPARQL query
library with automation patterns; and a prototypical interface. The ontology
strictly adheres to the standard's text and has been evaluated according to
FAIR principles, the OOPS framework, competency questions, and community
feedback. The development of other middleware elements is guided by the
community needs and subject to ongoing evaluations. To demonstrate the utility
of our contributions, we illustrate dynamic AC management in an example
involving assurance of adversarial robustness in large language models.

### [3] [LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge: Fine-Tuning Large Language Models as a Clinical Evaluation Judge with Fuzzy Logic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11221)
*Weibing Zheng,Laurah Turner,Jess Kropczynski,Murat Ozer,Tri Nguyen,Shane Halse*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge方法，结合模糊逻辑和大型语言模型（LLM），用于自动化评估医学生的临床沟通技能，并与医生主观偏好对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床沟通技能在医学教育中至关重要，但大规模实践和评估具有挑战性。现有LLM驱动的临床模拟虽有效，但自动化评估难以匹配医生的主观判断。

Method: 通过数据收集、基于多维模糊集的数据标注、提示工程和监督微调（SFT）预训练LLM，开发LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge方法。

Result: LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge在主要评估标准上准确率超过90%，整体准确率超过80%，提供可解释且符合人类偏好的评估。

Conclusion: 模糊逻辑与LLM结合可行，推动了医学教育中的自动化评估，支持更稳健的评估实践。

Abstract: Clinical communication skills are critical in medical education, and
practicing and assessing clinical communication skills on a scale is
challenging. Although LLM-powered clinical scenario simulations have shown
promise in enhancing medical students' clinical practice, providing automated
and scalable clinical evaluation that follows nuanced physician judgment is
difficult. This paper combines fuzzy logic and Large Language Model (LLM) and
proposes LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge to address the challenge of aligning the
automated evaluation of medical students' clinical skills with subjective
physicians' preferences. LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge is an approach that LLM is
fine-tuned to evaluate medical students' utterances within student-AI patient
conversation scripts based on human annotations from four fuzzy sets, including
Professionalism, Medical Relevance, Ethical Behavior, and Contextual
Distraction. The methodology of this paper started from data collection from
the LLM-powered medical education system, data annotation based on
multidimensional fuzzy sets, followed by prompt engineering and the supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) of the pre-trained LLMs using these human annotations. The
results show that the LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge achieves over 80\% accuracy, with
major criteria items over 90\%, effectively leveraging fuzzy logic and LLM as a
solution to deliver interpretable, human-aligned assessment. This work suggests
the viability of leveraging fuzzy logic and LLM to align with human
preferences, advances automated evaluation in medical education, and supports
more robust assessment and judgment practices. The GitHub repository of this
work is available at https://github.com/2sigmaEdTech/LLMAsAJudge

### [4] [MUDAS: Mote-scale Unsupervised Domain Adaptation in Multi-label Sound Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11331)
*Jihoon Yun,Chengzhang Li,Dhrubojyoti Roy,Anish Arora*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MUDAS是一种针对资源受限物联网设备的多标签声音分类的无监督域适应框架，通过选择性重训练和自适应阈值提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有无监督域适应算法在多标签任务和资源受限设备上的局限性，特别是在城市声音分类场景中。

Method: MUDAS通过选择性重训练分类器、使用高置信度数据、自适应阈值生成伪标签，并应用多样性正则化。

Result: 在SONYC-UST数据集上，MUDAS显著提升了分类准确性，适合资源受限的物联网设备。

Conclusion: MUDAS为多标签声音分类提供了一种高效的无监督域适应解决方案，适用于资源受限环境。

Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) is essential for adapting machine
learning models to new, unlabeled environments where data distribution shifts
can degrade performance. Existing UDA algorithms are designed for single-label
tasks and rely on significant computational resources, limiting their use in
multi-label scenarios and in resource-constrained IoT devices. Overcoming these
limitations is particularly challenging in contexts such as urban sound
classification, where overlapping sounds and varying acoustics require robust,
adaptive multi-label capabilities on low-power, on-device systems. To address
these limitations, we introduce Mote-scale Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for
Sounds (MUDAS), a UDA framework developed for multi-label sound classification
in resource-constrained IoT settings. MUDAS efficiently adapts models by
selectively retraining the classifier in situ using high-confidence data,
minimizing computational and memory requirements to suit on-device deployment.
Additionally, MUDAS incorporates class-specific adaptive thresholds to generate
reliable pseudo-labels and applies diversity regularization to improve
multi-label classification accuracy. In evaluations on the SONYC Urban Sound
Tagging (SONYC-UST) dataset recorded at various New York City locations, MUDAS
demonstrates notable improvements in classification accuracy over existing UDA
algorithms, achieving good performance in a resource-constrained IoT setting.

### [5] [Benchmarking Multimodal LLMs on Recognition and Understanding over Chemical Tables](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11375)
*Yitong Zhou,Mingyue Cheng,Qingyang Mao,Yucong Luo,Qi Liu,Yupeng Li,Xiaohan Zhang,Deguang Liu,Xin Li,Enhong Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ChemTable是一个针对化学表格的多模态基准测试，旨在支持化学领域的科学理解，评估模型在表格识别和理解任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试忽视了化学表格的多模态和领域复杂性，限制了多模态大语言模型在化学科学理解中的应用。

Method: 引入ChemTable，一个从文献实验部分提取的大规模化学表格基准，包含专家标注的单元格、逻辑布局和领域标签，支持表格识别和理解任务。

Result: 模型在基本布局解析上表现尚可，但在描述性和推理性QA任务中表现显著低于人类水平，开源与闭源模型之间存在明显性能差距。

Conclusion: ChemTable为化学表格理解提供了严格且现实的基准，突显了化学领域表格理解的挑战。

Abstract: Chemical tables encode complex experimental knowledge through symbolic
expressions, structured variables, and embedded molecular graphics. Existing
benchmarks largely overlook this multimodal and domain-specific complexity,
limiting the ability of multimodal large language models to support scientific
understanding in chemistry. In this work, we introduce ChemTable, a large-scale
benchmark of real-world chemical tables curated from the experimental sections
of literature. ChemTable includes expert-annotated cell polygons, logical
layouts, and domain-specific labels, including reagents, catalysts, yields, and
graphical components and supports two core tasks: (1) Table Recognition,
covering structure parsing and content extraction; and (2) Table Understanding,
encompassing both descriptive and reasoning-oriented question answering
grounded in table structure and domain semantics. We evaluated a range of
representative multimodal models, including both open-source and closed-source
models, on ChemTable and reported a series of findings with practical and
conceptual insights. Although models show reasonable performance on basic
layout parsing, they exhibit substantial limitations on both descriptive and
inferential QA tasks compared to human performance, and we observe significant
performance gaps between open-source and closed-source models across multiple
dimensions. These results underscore the challenges of chemistry-aware table
understanding and position ChemTable as a rigorous and realistic benchmark for
advancing scientific reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究探讨了基于大型语言模型（LLM）的对话代理为家庭护理者提供心理健康支持的潜力，结合了问题解决疗法（PST）、动机访谈（MI）和行为链分析（BCA）。实验显示，Few-Shot和RAG提示技术的模型表现最佳，提升了共情和治疗联盟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 家庭护理者因多重角色和资源有限面临心理健康挑战，需要有效的支持工具。

Method: 采用被试内实验，28名护理者与四种LLM配置交互，评估共情和治疗联盟。结合Few-Shot、RAG技术和临床示例。

Result: 最佳模型在共情和治疗联盟上表现优异，参与者认可其情感验证和策略提供能力。

Conclusion: LLM在提供共情和个性化支持方面潜力显著，但需平衡评估与建议效率。

Abstract: Family caregivers often face substantial mental health challenges due to
their multifaceted roles and limited resources. This study explored the
potential of a large language model (LLM)-powered conversational agent to
deliver evidence-based mental health support for caregivers, specifically
Problem-Solving Therapy (PST) integrated with Motivational Interviewing (MI)
and Behavioral Chain Analysis (BCA). A within-subject experiment was conducted
with 28 caregivers interacting with four LLM configurations to evaluate empathy
and therapeutic alliance. The best-performing models incorporated Few-Shot and
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) prompting techniques, alongside
clinician-curated examples. The models showed improved contextual understanding
and personalized support, as reflected by qualitative responses and
quantitative ratings on perceived empathy and therapeutic alliances.
Participants valued the model's ability to validate emotions, explore
unexpressed feelings, and provide actionable strategies. However, balancing
thorough assessment with efficient advice delivery remains a challenge. This
work highlights the potential of LLMs in delivering empathetic and tailored
support for family caregivers.

### [7] [FocalAD: Local Motion Planning for End-to-End Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11419)
*Bin Sun,Boao Zhang,Jiayi Lu,Xinjie Feng,Jiachen Shang,Rui Cao,Mengchao Zheng,Chuanye Wang,Shichun Yang,Yaoguang Cao,Ziying Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FocalAD是一种新型端到端自动驾驶框架，专注于关键局部邻居并通过增强局部运动表示优化规划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖全局聚合的运动特征，忽略了规划决策主要受少量局部交互代理影响的事实，可能导致潜在风险被忽视。

Method: FocalAD包含两个核心模块：Ego-Local-Agents Interactor（ELAI）和Focal-Local-Agents Loss（FLA Loss），分别通过图基的自我中心交互表示和增加关键邻居权重来优化规划。

Result: FocalAD在nuScenes和Bench2Drive基准测试中表现优于现有方法，在Adv-nuScenes数据集上碰撞率显著降低。

Conclusion: FocalAD通过关注局部交互显著提升了自动驾驶规划的可靠性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: In end-to-end autonomous driving,the motion prediction plays a pivotal role
in ego-vehicle planning. However, existing methods often rely on globally
aggregated motion features, ignoring the fact that planning decisions are
primarily influenced by a small number of locally interacting agents. Failing
to attend to these critical local interactions can obscure potential risks and
undermine planning reliability. In this work, we propose FocalAD, a novel
end-to-end autonomous driving framework that focuses on critical local
neighbors and refines planning by enhancing local motion representations.
Specifically, FocalAD comprises two core modules: the Ego-Local-Agents
Interactor (ELAI) and the Focal-Local-Agents Loss (FLA Loss). ELAI conducts a
graph-based ego-centric interaction representation that captures motion
dynamics with local neighbors to enhance both ego planning and agent motion
queries. FLA Loss increases the weights of decision-critical neighboring
agents, guiding the model to prioritize those more relevant to planning.
Extensive experiments show that FocalAD outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods on the open-loop nuScenes datasets and closed-loop Bench2Drive
benchmark. Notably, on the robustness-focused Adv-nuScenes dataset, FocalAD
achieves even greater improvements, reducing the average colilision rate by
41.9% compared to DiffusionDrive and by 15.6% compared to SparseDrive.

### [8] [Resolve Highway Conflict in Multi-Autonomous Vehicle Controls with Local State Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11445)
*Xuan Duy Ta,Bang Giang Le,Thanh Ha Le,Viet Cuong Ta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种局部状态注意力模块，用于解决多智能体强化学习中的交通冲突问题，显著提高了高密度交通中的合并效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在混合交通环境中，自动驾驶车辆需要适应人类驾驶车辆和突发情况，但现有方法难以解决智能体间的局部冲突和随机事件。

Method: 提出局部状态注意力模块，利用自注意力操作压缩附近智能体的关键信息，以解决交通冲突。

Result: 在模拟高速公路合并场景中，该方法显著提高了合并效率，尤其是在高密度交通中。

Conclusion: 局部状态注意力模块有效解决了多智能体强化学习中的交通冲突问题，提升了自动驾驶车辆的适应性。

Abstract: In mixed-traffic environments, autonomous vehicles must adapt to
human-controlled vehicles and other unusual driving situations. This setting
can be framed as a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) environment with
full cooperative reward among the autonomous vehicles. While methods such as
Multi-agent Proximal Policy Optimization can be effective in training MARL
tasks, they often fail to resolve local conflict between agents and are unable
to generalize to stochastic events. In this paper, we propose a Local State
Attention module to assist the input state representation. By relying on the
self-attention operator, the module is expected to compress the essential
information of nearby agents to resolve the conflict in traffic situations.
Utilizing a simulated highway merging scenario with the priority vehicle as the
unexpected event, our approach is able to prioritize other vehicles'
information to manage the merging process. The results demonstrate significant
improvements in merging efficiency compared to popular baselines, especially in
high-density traffic settings.

### [9] [Structure-Aware Automatic Channel Pruning by Searching with Graph Embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11469)
*Zifan Liu,Yuan Cao,Yanwei Yu,Heng Qi,Jie Gui*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图卷积网络（GCN）的结构感知自动通道剪枝（SACP）框架，通过建模网络拓扑全局依赖关系，实现高效剪枝。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有剪枝方法依赖局部启发式或权重标准，无法捕捉网络全局结构依赖，导致剪枝效果不佳。

Method: 利用GCN建模网络拓扑，学习通道全局重要性，动态调整剪枝率组合，采用搜索方法确定最优剪枝率。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和ImageNet数据集上，SACP在压缩效率和精度保持上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SACP通过全局结构感知实现了高效自动剪枝，显著提升了剪枝效果。

Abstract: Channel pruning is a powerful technique to reduce the computational overhead
of deep neural networks, enabling efficient deployment on resource-constrained
devices. However, existing pruning methods often rely on local heuristics or
weight-based criteria that fail to capture global structural dependencies
within the network, leading to suboptimal pruning decisions and degraded model
performance. To address these limitations, we propose a novel structure-aware
automatic channel pruning (SACP) framework that utilizes graph convolutional
networks (GCNs) to model the network topology and learn the global importance
of each channel. By encoding structural relationships within the network, our
approach implements topology-aware pruning and this pruning is fully automated,
reducing the need for human intervention. We restrict the pruning rate
combinations to a specific space, where the number of combinations can be
dynamically adjusted, and use a search-based approach to determine the optimal
pruning rate combinations. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
(CIFAR-10, ImageNet) with various models (ResNet, VGG16) demonstrate that SACP
outperforms state-of-the-art pruning methods on compression efficiency and
competitive on accuracy retention.

*Chenrui Cao,Liangcheng Song,Zenan Li,Xinyi Le,Xian Zhang,Hui Xue,Fan Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DSP+框架通过神经符号协调，无需额外训练，实现了与现有RL方法相当的自动定理证明性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索无需大规模训练的神经符号协调方法，以提升自动定理证明的效率和可解释性。

Method: 改进DSP框架，分阶段（草稿、草图、证明）进行细粒度神经符号增强，整合现有推理模型和符号搜索方法。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，解决了IMO问题，并发现了一些形式化错误。

Conclusion: DSP+展示了经典推理模式的潜力，为自动定理证明提供了高效且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements, such as DeepSeek-Prover-V2-671B and
Kimina-Prover-Preview-72B, demonstrate a prevailing trend in leveraging
reinforcement learning (RL)-based large-scale training for automated theorem
proving. Surprisingly, we discover that even without any training, careful
neuro-symbolic coordination of existing off-the-shelf reasoning models and
tactic step provers can achieve comparable performance. This paper introduces
\textbf{DSP+}, an improved version of the Draft, Sketch, and Prove framework,
featuring a \emph{fine-grained and integrated} neuro-symbolic enhancement for
each phase: (1) In the draft phase, we prompt reasoning models to generate
concise natural-language subgoals to benefit the sketch phase, removing
thinking tokens and references to human-written proofs; (2) In the sketch
phase, subgoals are autoformalized with hypotheses to benefit the proving
phase, and sketch lines containing syntactic errors are masked according to
predefined rules; (3) In the proving phase, we tightly integrate symbolic
search methods like Aesop with step provers to establish proofs for the sketch
subgoals. Experimental results show that, without any additional model training
or fine-tuning, DSP+ solves 80.7\%, 32.8\%, and 24 out of 644 problems from
miniF2F, ProofNet, and PutnamBench, respectively, while requiring fewer budgets
compared to state-of-the-arts. DSP+ proves \texttt{imo\_2019\_p1}, an IMO
problem in miniF2F that is not solved by any prior work. Additionally, DSP+
generates proof patterns comprehensible by human experts, facilitating the
identification of formalization errors; For example, eight wrongly formalized
statements in miniF2F are discovered. Our results highlight the potential of
classical reasoning patterns besides the RL-based training. All components will
be open-sourced.

*Yu Wang,Shiwan Zhao,Ming Fan,Zhihu Wang,Yubo Zhang,Xicheng Zhang,Zhengfan Wang,Heyuan Huang,Ting Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RAG+通过将知识与应用示例结合，改进了传统RAG模型，显著提升了任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG模型在知识应用方面存在不足，缺乏任务特定的推理能力。

Method: RAG+构建了一个包含知识和应用示例的双重语料库，并在推理过程中联合检索两者。

Result: 在数学、法律和医学领域，RAG+平均提升3-5%，复杂场景下峰值提升7.5%。

Conclusion: RAG+通过结合检索与知识应用，为知识集成提供了更认知化的框架，提升了LLM的能力和可解释性。

Abstract: The integration of external knowledge through Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) has become foundational in enhancing large language models (LLMs) for
knowledge-intensive tasks. However, existing RAG paradigms often overlook the
cognitive step of applying knowledge, leaving a gap between retrieved facts and
task-specific reasoning. In this work, we introduce RAG+, a principled and
modular extension that explicitly incorporates application-aware reasoning into
the RAG pipeline. RAG+ constructs a dual corpus consisting of knowledge and
aligned application examples, created either manually or automatically, and
retrieves both jointly during inference. This design enables LLMs not only to
access relevant information but also to apply it within structured,
goal-oriented reasoning processes. Experiments across mathematical, legal, and
medical domains, conducted on multiple models, demonstrate that RAG+
consistently outperforms standard RAG variants, achieving average improvements
of 3-5%, and peak gains up to 7.5% in complex scenarios. By bridging retrieval
with actionable application, RAG+ advances a more cognitively grounded
framework for knowledge integration, representing a step toward more
interpretable and capable LLMs.

### [12] [Collaborative LLM Inference via Planning for Efficient Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11578)
*Byeongchan Lee,Jonghoon Lee,Dongyoung Kim,Jaehyung Kim,Jinwoo Shin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种测试时协作框架，让小模型和大模型通过多轮协作解决复杂任务，减少对昂贵API的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大模型（如参数超过100B）推理成本高，小模型（如参数小于3B）免费但推理能力不足，如何结合两者的优势？

Method: 设计一个测试时协作框架，其中规划模型生成问题的高层抽象计划，推理模型基于计划生成完整解决方案，两者通过多轮协作完成任务。

Result: 该方法在保持与强大专有模型相近的准确性的同时，显著减少对付费推理的依赖。

Conclusion: 规划是协调成本感知、跨模型推理的有效先验，适用于实际部署约束。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks, but those with
strong capabilities (e.g., whose numbers of parameters are larger than 100B)
are often accessible only through paid APIs, making them too costly for
applications of frequent use. In contrast, smaller open-sourced LLMs (e.g.,
whose numbers of parameters are less than 3B) are freely available and easy to
deploy locally (e.g., under a single GPU having 8G VRAM), but lack suff icient
reasoning ability. This trade-off raises a natural question: can small (free)
and large (costly) models collaborate at test time to combine their strengths?
We propose a test-time collaboration framework in which a planner model first
generates a plan, defined as a distilled and high-level abstraction of the
problem.
  This plan serves as a lightweight intermediate that guides a reasoner model,
which generates a complete solution. Small and large models take turns acting
as planner and reasoner, exchanging plans in a multi-round cascade to
collaboratively solve complex tasks. Our method achieves accuracy comparable to
strong proprietary models alone, while significantly reducing reliance on paid
inference. These results highlight planning as an effective prior for
orchestrating cost-aware, cross-model inference under real-world deployment
constraints.

*René Peinl,Vincent Tischler*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了一个新的基准数据集，用于评估视觉语言模型（VLMs）在结合视觉推理和德语特定学科背景知识的任务上的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有英语基准数据集常依赖人为困难或脱离上下文的问题，而该数据集基于真实中学课程内容，旨在更真实地评估VLMs的多模态理解能力。

Method: 数据集包含2,000多个开放式问题，基于486张图像，覆盖数学、历史等九大学科。评估了13种先进VLMs在多个维度上的表现。

Result: 最强模型总体准确率不足45%，在音乐、数学和对抗性问题上表现尤其差。结果显示流行基准与真实多模态理解存在显著差距。

Conclusion: 中学级任务是测试VLMs的有意义且未被充分利用的途径，尤其在非英语环境中。数据集和评估协议为未来AI系统的改进提供了严格测试平台。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel benchmark dataset designed to evaluate the
capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs) on tasks that combine visual
reasoning with subject-specific background knowledge in the German language. In
contrast to widely used English-language benchmarks that often rely on
artificially difficult or decontextualized problems, this dataset draws from
real middle school curricula across nine domains including mathematics,
history, biology, and religion. The benchmark includes over 2,000 open-ended
questions grounded in 486 images, ensuring that models must integrate visual
interpretation with factual reasoning rather than rely on superficial textual
cues. We evaluate thirteen state-of-the-art open-weight VLMs across multiple
dimensions, including domain-specific accuracy and performance on adversarial
crafted questions. Our findings reveal that even the strongest models achieve
less than 45% overall accuracy, with particularly poor performance in music,
mathematics, and adversarial settings. Furthermore, the results indicate
significant discrepancies between success on popular benchmarks and real-world
multimodal understanding. We conclude that middle school-level tasks offer a
meaningful and underutilized avenue for stress-testing VLMs, especially in
non-English contexts. The dataset and evaluation protocol serve as a rigorous
testbed to better understand and improve the visual and linguistic reasoning
capabilities of future AI systems.

TL;DR: SymMPO提出了一种对称多模态偏好优化方法，通过直接偏好监督和偏好间隙一致性损失，有效减少MLLMs的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在优化目标函数不严谨和间接偏好监督的问题，需要改进。

Method: SymMPO采用对称偏好学习和直接偏好监督，引入偏好间隙一致性损失。

Result: 在五个基准测试中表现优异，验证了其在减少MLLMs幻觉方面的有效性。

Conclusion: SymMPO通过严谨的理论对齐和直接监督，显著提升了MLLMs的性能。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as an effective approach for
mitigating hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Although
existing methods have achieved significant progress by utilizing
vision-oriented contrastive objectives for enhancing MLLMs' attention to visual
inputs and hence reducing hallucination, they suffer from non-rigorous
optimization objective function and indirect preference supervision. To address
these limitations, we propose a Symmetric Multimodal Preference Optimization
(SymMPO), which conducts symmetric preference learning with direct preference
supervision (i.e., response pairs) for visual understanding enhancement, while
maintaining rigorous theoretical alignment with standard DPO. In addition to
conventional ordinal preference learning, SymMPO introduces a preference margin
consistency loss to quantitatively regulate the preference gap between
symmetric preference pairs. Comprehensive evaluation across five benchmarks
demonstrate SymMPO's superior performance, validating its effectiveness in
hallucination mitigation of MLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究R-GNNs在规划领域中学习价值函数的泛化能力，尤其是基于$C_2$特征的表达。

Method: 理论分析R-GNNs的表达能力，并与$C_2$特征的关系进行对比。

Result: R-GNNs无法学习由$C_2$特征定义的价值函数，但发现其他GNN架构可能更适合。

Conclusion: R-GNNs在特定规划任务中存在局限性，需探索其他GNN架构以实现更好的学习效果。

Abstract: Relational Graph Neural Networks (R-GNNs) are a GNN-based approach for
learning value functions that can generalise to unseen problems from a given
planning domain. R-GNNs were theoretically motivated by the well known
connection between the expressive power of GNNs and $C_2$, first-order logic
with two variables and counting. In the context of planning, $C_2$ features
refer to the set of formulae in $C_2$ with relations defined by the unary and
binary predicates of a planning domain. Some planning domains exhibit optimal
value functions that can be decomposed as arithmetic expressions of $C_2$
features. We show that, contrary to empirical results, R-GNNs cannot learn
value functions defined by $C_2$ features. We also identify prior GNN
architectures for planning that may better learn value functions defined by
$C_2$ features.

Result: 证明了因果效应在多环境数据下的可识别性条件，并通过合成数据实验验证了方法的性能。

Conclusion: 结论表明，在特定条件下，因果效应可通过多环境数据识别，但需注意噪声分布变化对可识别性的影响。

Abstract: We investigate the estimation of the causal effect of a treatment variable on
an outcome in the presence of a latent confounder. We first show that the
causal effect is identifiable under certain conditions when data is available
from multiple environments, provided that the target causal effect remains
invariant across these environments. Secondly, we propose a moment-based
algorithm for estimating the causal effect as long as only a single parameter
of the data-generating mechanism varies across environments -- whether it be
the exogenous noise distribution or the causal relationship between two
variables. Conversely, we prove that identifiability is lost if both exogenous
noise distributions of both the latent and treatment variables vary across
environments. Finally, we propose a procedure to identify which parameter of
the data-generating mechanism has varied across the environments and evaluate
the performance of our proposed methods through experiments on synthetic data.

Motivation: 房地产市场存在严重的信息不对称，LLMs可能通过提供透明且可交互的房价估计来改善这一问题。

Method: 系统评估了多种LLMs在不同国际住房数据集上的表现，比较了零样本、少样本、市场报告增强和混合提示技术。

Result: LLMs能够有效利用特征变量生成有意义的估计，虽传统模型在预测准确性上更强，但LLMs提供了更易访问和解释的替代方案。

Conclusion: LLMs在房地产评估中具有提升透明度的潜力，但需谨慎处理其过度自信和空间推理限制问题。

Abstract: The real estate market is vital to global economies but suffers from
significant information asymmetry. This study examines how Large Language
Models (LLMs) can democratize access to real estate insights by generating
competitive and interpretable house price estimates through optimized
In-Context Learning (ICL) strategies. We systematically evaluate leading LLMs
on diverse international housing datasets, comparing zero-shot, few-shot,
market report-enhanced, and hybrid prompting techniques. Our results show that
LLMs effectively leverage hedonic variables, such as property size and
amenities, to produce meaningful estimates. While traditional machine learning
models remain strong for pure predictive accuracy, LLMs offer a more
accessible, interactive and interpretable alternative. Although
self-explanations require cautious interpretation, we find that LLMs explain
their predictions in agreement with state-of-the-art models, confirming their
trustworthiness. Carefully selected in-context examples based on feature
similarity and geographic proximity, significantly enhance LLM performance, yet
LLMs struggle with overconfidence in price intervals and limited spatial
reasoning. We offer practical guidance for structured prediction tasks through
prompt optimization. Our findings highlight LLMs' potential to improve
transparency in real estate appraisal and provide actionable insights for
stakeholders.

Motivation: LLMs广泛用于模拟社会行为，但其政治偏见和辩论中的互动动态尚未充分研究。

Method: 通过多智能体辩论框架，系统变化LLM类型、智能体性别和辩论形式，分析其对政治偏见的影响。

Result: 中性智能体偏向民主党，共和党智能体向中性靠拢；性别影响态度；相同政治倾向的智能体会形成回音室。

Conclusion: LLMs的政治偏见和互动动态受模型来源、性别和辩论形式影响，需进一步研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate social
behaviour, yet their political biases and interaction dynamics in debates
remain underexplored. We investigate how LLM type and agent gender attributes
influence political bias using a structured multi-agent debate framework, by
engaging Neutral, Republican, and Democrat American LLM agents in debates on
politically sensitive topics. We systematically vary the underlying LLMs, agent
genders, and debate formats to examine how model provenance and agent personas
influence political bias and attitudes throughout debates. We find that Neutral
agents consistently align with Democrats, while Republicans shift closer to the
Neutral; gender influences agent attitudes, with agents adapting their opinions
when aware of other agents' genders; and contrary to prior research, agents
with shared political affiliations can form echo chambers, exhibiting the
expected intensification of attitudes as debates progress.

Method: 通过AI自动化招聘的案例研究，分析数据偏见对系统的影响，并提出一种隐私增强框架以减少性别信息。

Result: 实验表明，提出的框架能有效防止训练系统复制数据中的偏见。

Conclusion: 隐私增强框架是减少LLMs中人口统计偏见的可行方法。

Abstract: The use of language technologies in high-stake settings is increasing in
recent years, mostly motivated by the success of Large Language Models (LLMs).
However, despite the great performance of LLMs, they are are susceptible to
ethical concerns, such as demographic biases, accountability, or privacy. This
work seeks to analyze the capacity of Transformers-based systems to learn
demographic biases present in the data, using a case study on AI-based
automated recruitment. We propose a privacy-enhancing framework to reduce
gender information from the learning pipeline as a way to mitigate biased
behaviors in the final tools. Our experiments analyze the influence of data
biases on systems built on two different LLMs, and how the proposed framework
effectively prevents trained systems from reproducing the bias in the data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人-AI决策中预测正确性、知识成本和置信度平衡的问题。

Method: 采用两阶段策略：延迟策略决定是否接受基础模型答案或使用大型模型重新生成；弃权策略决定是否需要人工干预。结合在线学习机制。

Result: 在通用问答和医学问答任务中，级联策略在准确性和成本上优于单模型基线。

Conclusion: 级联框架提供了一种高效、成本可控且可处理弃权的决策方法。

Abstract: Effective human-AI decision-making balances three key factors: the
\textit{correctness} of predictions, the \textit{cost} of knowledge and
reasoning complexity, and the confidence about whether to \textit{abstain}
automated answers or involve human experts. In this work, we present a cascaded
LLM decision framework that adaptively delegates tasks across multiple tiers of
expertise -- a base model for initial candidate answers, a more capable and
knowledgeable (but costlier) large model, and a human expert for when the model
cascade abstains. Our method proceeds in two stages. First, a deferral policy
determines whether to accept the base model's answer or regenerate it with the
large model based on the confidence score. Second, an abstention policy decides
whether the cascade model response is sufficiently certain or requires human
intervention. Moreover, we incorporate an online learning mechanism in the
framework that can leverage human feedback to improve decision quality over
time. We demonstrate this approach to general question-answering (ARC-Easy and
ARC-Challenge) and medical question-answering (MedQA and MedMCQA). Our results
show that our cascaded strategy outperforms in most cases single-model
baselines in accuracy while reducing cost and providing a principled way to
handle abstentions.

Motivation: 当前模式链接模型采用死记硬背的学习方式，过度优化真实结果而牺牲推理能力，缺乏高质量推理样本。

Method: Schema-R1通过构建高质量推理样本小批量、监督微调冷启动初始化、基于规则的强化学习训练三个步骤实现。

Result: 实验表明，Schema-R1在过滤准确率上比现有方法提升了10%。

Conclusion: Schema-R1有效提升了模式链接模型的推理能力，为Text-to-SQL任务提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Schema linking is a critical step in Text-to-SQL task, aiming to accurately
predict the table names and column names required for the SQL query based on
the given question. However, current fine-tuning approaches for schema linking
models employ a rote-learning paradigm, excessively optimizing for ground truth
schema linking outcomes while compromising reasoning ability. This limitation
arises because of the difficulty in acquiring a high-quality reasoning sample
for downstream tasks. To address this, we propose Schema-R1, a reasoning schema
linking model trained using reinforcement learning. Specifically, Schema-R1
consists of three key steps: constructing small batches of high-quality
reasoning samples, supervised fine-tuning for cold-start initialization, and
rule-based reinforcement learning training. The final results demonstrate that
our method effectively enhances the reasoning ability of the schema linking
model, achieving a 10\% improvement in filter accuracy compared to the existing
method. Our code is available at https://github.com/hongWin/Schema-R1/.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准多关注最终结果，忽略中间推理步骤，而评估这些步骤对理解模型行为和提升可靠性至关重要。

Method: 使用战略游戏作为评估环境，提出框架评估三个核心维度：规划、修正和资源约束决策，并定义新指标。

Result: 在4320轮对抗中，ChatGPT-o3-mini综合得分最高，Qwen-Plus表现较差。修正频率与成功率呈负相关。

Conclusion: 评估大语言模型的决策过程比仅关注结果更有价值。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for tasks that require
complex reasoning. Most benchmarks focus on final outcomes but overlook the
intermediate reasoning steps - such as planning, revision, and decision making
under resource constraints. We argue that measuring these internal processes is
essential for understanding model behavior and improving reliability. We
propose using strategic games as a natural evaluation environment: closed,
rule-based systems with clear states, limited resources, and automatic
feedback. We introduce a framework that evaluates LLMs along three core
dimensions: planning, revision, and resource-constrained decision making. To
operationalize this, we define metrics beyond win rate, including
overcorrection risk rate, correction success rate, improvement slope, and
over-budget ratio. In 4320 adversarial rounds across 12 leading models,
ChatGPT-o3-mini achieves the top composite score, with a win rate of 74.7
percent, a correction success rate of 78.6 percent, and an improvement slope of
0.041. By contrast, Qwen-Plus, despite an overcorrection risk rate of 81.6
percent, wins only 25.6 percent of its matches - primarily due to excessive
resource use. We also observe a negative correlation between overcorrection
risk rate and correction success rate (Pearson r = -0.51, p = 0.093),
suggesting that more frequent edits do not always improve outcomes. Our
findings highlight the value of assessing not only what LLMs decide but how
they arrive at those decisions

Result: 评测结果受细微条件差异影响显著，性能改进难以稳定复现。

Conclusion: 呼吁建立更严格的模型性能评测范式，以确保结果的可信性。

Abstract: Reasoning models represented by the Deepseek-R1-Distill series have been
widely adopted by the open-source community due to their strong performance in
mathematics, science, programming, and other domains. However, our study
reveals that their benchmark evaluation results are subject to significant
fluctuations caused by various factors. Subtle differences in evaluation
conditions can lead to substantial variations in results. Similar phenomena are
observed in other open-source inference models fine-tuned based on the
Deepseek-R1-Distill series, as well as in the QwQ-32B model, making their
claimed performance improvements difficult to reproduce reliably. Therefore, we
advocate for the establishment of a more rigorous paradigm for model
performance evaluation and present our empirical assessments of the
Deepseek-R1-Distill series models.

Motivation: 电信运营调度任务复杂且缺乏评估基准，阻碍了大语言模型在该领域的应用潜力探索。

Method: 设计了TeleEval-OS基准，涵盖四个关键运营阶段，并采用零样本和少样本评估方法测试14个大语言模型。

Result: 实验表明开源模型在特定场景下优于闭源模型，展现了其在电信运营调度中的潜力。

Conclusion: TeleEval-OS填补了研究空白，为大语言模型在电信运营调度中的应用提供了评估工具。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly
propelled progress in artificial intelligence, demonstrating substantial
application potential across multiple specialized domains. Telecommunications
operation scheduling (OS) is a critical aspect of the telecommunications
industry, involving the coordinated management of networks, services, risks,
and human resources to optimize production scheduling and ensure unified
service control. However, the inherent complexity and domain-specific nature of
OS tasks, coupled with the absence of comprehensive evaluation benchmarks, have
hindered thorough exploration of LLMs' application potential in this critical
field. To address this research gap, we propose the first Telecommunications
Operation Scheduling Evaluation Benchmark (TeleEval-OS). Specifically, this
benchmark comprises 15 datasets across 13 subtasks, comprehensively simulating
four key operational stages: intelligent ticket creation, intelligent ticket
handling, intelligent ticket closure, and intelligent evaluation. To
systematically assess the performance of LLMs on tasks of varying complexity,
we categorize their capabilities in telecommunications operation scheduling
into four hierarchical levels, arranged in ascending order of difficulty: basic
NLP, knowledge Q&A, report generation, and report analysis. On TeleEval-OS, we
leverage zero-shot and few-shot evaluation methods to comprehensively assess 10
open-source LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-V3) and 4 closed-source LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o)
across diverse scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that open-source
LLMs can outperform closed-source LLMs in specific scenarios, highlighting
their significant potential and value in the field of telecommunications
operation scheduling.

Conclusion: 研究为RAG系统提供了位置感知分析的理论和实证基础，建议采用证据重排序或去偏策略以提高系统可靠性和公平性。

Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have become essential
in knowledge-intensive and open-domain tasks. As retrieval complexity
increases, ensuring the robustness of these systems is critical. However,
current RAG models are highly sensitive to the order in which evidence is
presented, often resulting in unstable performance and biased reasoning,
particularly as the number of retrieved items or modality diversity grows. This
raises a central question: How does the position of retrieved evidence affect
multimodal RAG performance? To answer this, we present the first comprehensive
study of position bias in multimodal RAG systems. Through controlled
experiments across text-only, image-only, and mixed-modality tasks, we observe
a consistent U-shaped accuracy curve with respect to evidence position. To
quantify this bias, we introduce the Position Sensitivity Index ($PSI_p$) and
develop a visualization framework to trace attention allocation patterns across
decoder layers. Our results reveal that multimodal interactions intensify
position bias compared to unimodal settings, and that this bias increases
logarithmically with retrieval range. These findings offer both theoretical and
empirical foundations for position-aware analysis in RAG, highlighting the need
for evidence reordering or debiasing strategies to build more reliable and
equitable generation systems.

dictionary of the language, grouped by synonyms and word origins. Subsequently,
we use this dictionary to formulate hypotheses about the core principles of
word formation and grammatical structure in Russenorsk and show which
hypotheses generated by large language models correspond to the hypotheses
previously proposed ones in the academic literature. We also develop a
"reconstruction" translation agent that generates hypothetical Russenorsk

Abstract: Objective: Develop a cost-effective, large language model (LLM)-based
pipeline for automatically extracting Review of Systems (ROS) entities from
clinical notes. Materials and Methods: The pipeline extracts ROS sections using
SecTag, followed by few-shot LLMs to identify ROS entity spans, their
positive/negative status, and associated body systems. We implemented the
pipeline using open-source LLMs (Mistral, Llama, Gemma) and ChatGPT. The
evaluation was conducted on 36 general medicine notes containing 341 annotated
ROS entities. Results: When integrating ChatGPT, the pipeline achieved the
lowest error rates in detecting ROS entity spans and their corresponding
statuses/systems (28.2% and 14.5%, respectively). Open-source LLMs enable
local, cost-efficient execution of the pipeline while delivering promising
performance with similarly low error rates (span: 30.5-36.7%; status/system:
24.3-27.3%). Discussion and Conclusion: Our pipeline offers a scalable and
locally deployable solution to reduce ROS documentation burden. Open-source
LLMs present a viable alternative to commercial models in resource-limited
healthcare environments.

Motivation: 探讨LLMs在道德义务判断中的行为，揭示模态表达（如‘必须’或‘应该’）对模型判断的影响。

Method: 分析LLMs在不同模态表达下的义务判断行为，并提出结合少量示例和推理提示的缓解策略。

Result: LLMs在模态表达存在时，将超过90%的常识情境判断为义务性，且这一现象在不同模型和问题类型中一致。

Conclusion: 模态表达作为语言框架显著影响LLMs的规范性决策，需解决此类偏见以确保判断一致性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly engaging in moral and ethical
reasoning, where criteria for judgment are often unclear, even for humans.
While LLM alignment studies cover many areas, one important yet underexplored
area is how LLMs make judgments about obligations. This work reveals a strong
tendency in LLMs to judge non-obligatory contexts as obligations when prompts
are augmented with modal expressions such as must or ought to. We introduce
this phenomenon as Deontological Keyword Bias (DKB). We find that LLMs judge
over 90\% of commonsense scenarios as obligations when modal expressions are
present. This tendency is consist across various LLM families, question types,
and answer formats. To mitigate DKB, we propose a judgment strategy that
integrates few-shot examples with reasoning prompts. This study sheds light on
how modal expressions, as a form of linguistic framing, influence the normative
decisions of LLMs and underscores the importance of addressing such biases to
ensure judgment alignment.

prototype models through language remains partially underutilized. This
limitation stems from gaps between designers' languages and modeling languages,
including mismatch in abstraction levels, fluctuation in semantic precision,
and divergence in lexical scopes. To bridge these gaps, we propose an interface
architecture that serves as a medium between the two languages. Grounded in
design principles derived from a systematic investigation of fast prototyping
practices, we devise the interface's operational mechanism and develop an
algorithm for its automated domain specification. Both machine-based
evaluations and human studies on fast prototyping across various product design
domains demonstrate the interface's potential to function as an auxiliary
module for Large Language Models, enabling precise and effective targeted
control of prototype models.

### [30] [CLAIM: Mitigating Multilingual Object Hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models with Cross-Lingual Attention Intervention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11073)
*Zekai Ye,Qiming Li,Xiaocheng Feng,Libo Qin,Yichong Huang,Baohang Li,Kui Jiang,Yang Xiang,Zhirui Zhang,Yunfei Lu,Duyu Tang,Dandan Tu,Bing Qin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CLAIM提出了一种无需训练的方法，通过调整跨语言注意力模式来减少多语言对象幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在多语言查询中更容易产生与视觉输入不一致的响应，现有方法依赖资源密集的预训练或微调。

Method: CLAIM通过识别语言特定的跨模态注意力头，估计语言偏移向量，并在推理时干预注意力输出，以对齐跨语言视觉感知能力。

Result: 实验表明，CLAIM在POPE和MME基准上分别平均提升了13.56%和21.75%的性能，西班牙语最高提升30%。

Conclusion: CLAIM是一种高效且无需训练的方法，显著减少了多语言对象幻觉，中间层的注意力差异在多语言场景中尤为关键。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive multimodal
abilities but remain prone to multilingual object hallucination, with a higher
likelihood of generating responses inconsistent with the visual input when
utilizing queries in non-English languages compared to English. Most existing
approaches to address these rely on pretraining or fine-tuning, which are
resource-intensive. In this paper, inspired by observing the disparities in
cross-modal attention patterns across languages, we propose Cross-Lingual
Attention Intervention for Mitigating multilingual object hallucination (CLAIM)
in LVLMs, a novel near training-free method by aligning attention patterns.
CLAIM first identifies language-specific cross-modal attention heads, then
estimates language shift vectors from English to the target language, and
finally intervenes in the attention outputs during inference to facilitate
cross-lingual visual perception capability alignment. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that CLAIM achieves an average improvement of 13.56% (up to 30% in
Spanish) on the POPE and 21.75% on the hallucination subsets of the MME
benchmark across various languages. Further analysis reveals that multilingual
attention divergence is most prominent in intermediate layers, highlighting
their critical role in multilingual scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CyclicReflex的动态调整反思令牌（reflection tokens）的解码策略，通过类比学习率调度，优化大型推理模型（LRMs）的性能。实验表明，该方法在多个数据集上优于标准解码和其他最新方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反思令牌在大型推理模型中的使用存在过度或不足的问题，影响模型性能。研究旨在通过动态调整反思令牌的频率和位置，优化模型的计算性能。

Method: 提出CyclicReflex策略，利用位置相关的三角波形动态调制反思令牌的logits，类比学习率调度。

Result: 在MATH500、AIME2024/2025和AMC2023等数据集上，CyclicReflex在不同规模的模型（1.5B-8B）中均表现优异，优于标准解码和其他方法。

Conclusion: CyclicReflex通过动态调整反思令牌，有效提升了大型推理模型的性能，为资源分配问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs), such as OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek-R1, harness
test-time scaling to perform multi-step reasoning for complex problem-solving.
This reasoning process, executed before producing final answers, is often
guided by special juncture tokens or textual segments that prompt
self-evaluative reflection. We refer to these transition markers and reflective
cues as "reflection tokens" (e.g., "wait", "but", "alternatively"). In this
work, we treat reflection tokens as a "resource" and introduce the problem of
resource allocation, aimed at improving the test-time compute performance of
LRMs by adaptively regulating the frequency and placement of reflection tokens.
Through empirical analysis, we show that both excessive and insufficient use of
reflection tokens, referred to as over-reflection and under-reflection, can
degrade model performance. To better understand and manage this trade-off, we
draw an analogy between reflection token usage and learning rate scheduling in
optimization. Building on this insight, we propose cyclical reflection token
scheduling (termed CyclicReflex), a decoding strategy that dynamically
modulates reflection token logits using a position-dependent triangular
waveform. Experiments on MATH500, AIME2024/2025, and AMC2023 demonstrate that
CyclicReflex consistently improves performance across model sizes (1.5B-8B),
outperforming standard decoding and more recent approaches such as TIP (thought
switching penalty) and S1. Codes are available at

TL;DR: RoE-FND是一个结合大型语言模型和经验学习的框架，通过逻辑推理任务改进假新闻检测，解决了现有方法的噪声、泛化瓶颈和决策不透明问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线虚假内容泛滥，现有证据基础的假新闻检测方法存在噪声证据选择、泛化瓶颈和决策不透明等问题，需要更鲁棒的解决方案。

Method: RoE-FND分为两个阶段：自反知识构建（分析历史推理错误）和动态标准检索（从历史案例中提取推理指南），并通过双通道程序交叉验证。

Result: RoE-FND在三个数据集上表现出优于现有方法的泛化能力和有效性。

Conclusion: RoE-FND通过结合经验学习和逻辑推理，提供了一种无需训练的适应性框架，显著提升了假新闻检测的性能。

Abstract: The proliferation of deceptive content online necessitates robust Fake News
Detection (FND) systems. While evidence-based approaches leverage external
knowledge to verify claims, existing methods face critical limitations: noisy
evidence selection, generalization bottlenecks, and unclear decision-making
processes. Recent efforts to harness Large Language Models (LLMs) for FND
introduce new challenges, including hallucinated rationales and conclusion
bias. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{RoE-FND}
(\textbf{\underline{R}}eason \textbf{\underline{o}}n
\textbf{\underline{E}}xperiences FND), a framework that reframes evidence-based
FND as a logical deduction task by synergizing LLMs with experiential learning.
RoE-FND encompasses two stages: (1) \textit{self-reflective knowledge
building}, where a knowledge base is curated by analyzing past reasoning
errors, namely the exploration stage, and (2) \textit{dynamic criterion
retrieval}, which synthesizes task-specific reasoning guidelines from
historical cases as experiences during deployment. It further cross-checks
rationales against internal experience through a devised dual-channel
procedure. Key contributions include: a case-based reasoning framework for FND
that addresses multiple existing challenges, a training-free approach enabling
adaptation to evolving situations, and empirical validation of the framework's
superior generalization and effectiveness over state-of-the-art methods across
three datasets.

Motivation: 随着MLLMs的快速发展，需要评估其是否能在多模态任务中超越人类表现。

Method: 开发了包含1,314个问题的双语基准测试MANBench，涵盖知识型和非知识型任务，并通过人类实验与MLLMs对比。

Result: MLLMs在知识和文本-图像理解任务中表现优异，但在跨模态推理和复杂任务（如谜题和空间想象）上表现不佳。

Conclusion: MANBench揭示了MLLMs的局限性，呼吁进一步研究以缩小其与人类多模态能力的差距。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has ignited
discussions regarding their potential to surpass human performance in
multimodal tasks. In response, we introduce MANBench (Multimodal Ability Norms
Benchmark), a bilingual benchmark (English and Chinese) comprising 1,314
questions across nine tasks, spanning knowledge-based and non-knowledge-based
domains. MANBench emphasizes intuitive reasoning, seamless cross-modal
integration, and real-world complexity, providing a rigorous evaluation
framework.
  Through extensive human experiments involving diverse participants, we
compared human performance against state-of-the-art MLLMs. The results indicate
that while MLLMs excel in tasks like Knowledge and Text-Image Understanding,
they struggle with deeper cross-modal reasoning tasks such as Transmorphic
Understanding, Image Consistency, and Multi-image Understanding. Moreover, both
humans and MLLMs face challenges in highly complex tasks like Puzzles and
Spatial Imagination.
  MANBench highlights the strengths and limitations of MLLMs, revealing that
even advanced models fall short of achieving human-level performance across
many domains. We hope MANBench will inspire efforts to bridge the gap between
MLLMs and human multimodal capabilities. The code and dataset are available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用开源大语言模型（LLMs）从自然语言规范中生成上下文无关计数器文法（CCFGs）的方法，结合少量标注样本和强化学习，显著提升了文法质量和测试效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从自然语言规范生成有效且通用的文法是一个关键挑战，尤其是在有限监督下。CCFGs能够通过计数器值存储和重用逻辑约束，但如何高效诱导CCFGs仍需探索。

Method: 方法包括：1）微调开源LLM进行规范到文法的翻译；2）应用GRPO增强文法有效性和通用性；3）通过迭代反馈纠正语法和语义错误。

Result: 实验表明，SAGE方法在文法有效性和测试效果上优于17种开源和闭源LLMs，分别提升15.92%和12.34%。

Conclusion: SAGE通过结合LLMs和强化学习，显著提升了文法生成的质量和测试效果，为有限监督下的文法诱导提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Grammar-based test case generation has proven effective for competitive
programming problems, but generating valid and general grammars from natural
language specifications remains a key challenge, especially under limited
supervision. Context-Free Grammars with Counters (CCFGs) have recently been
introduced as a formalism to represent such specifications with logical
constraints by storing and reusing counter values during derivation. In this
work, we explore the use of open-source large language models (LLMs) to induce
CCFGs from specifications using a small number of labeled examples and
verifiable reward-guided reinforcement learning. Our approach first fine-tunes
an open-source LLM to perform specification-to-grammar translation, and further
applies Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enhance grammar validity
and generality. We also examine the effectiveness of iterative feedback for
open and closed-source LLMs in correcting syntactic and semantic errors in
generated grammars.
  Experimental results show that our approach SAGE achieves stronger
generalization and outperforms 17 open and closed-source LLMs in both grammar
quality and test effectiveness, improving over the state-of-the-art by 15.92%p
in grammar validity and 12.34%p in test effectiveness. We provide our
implementation and dataset at the following anonymous

TL;DR: PRISM是一种基于Transformer的架构，用于建模临床决策的序列进展，通过学习预测患者诊断过程中的下一步，显著优于随机基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖孤立的诊断分类，无法捕捉临床轨迹的序列依赖性，PRISM旨在填补这一空白。

Method: PRISM将临床轨迹标记化为事件序列（如诊断测试、实验室结果），利用自定义临床词汇和自回归训练目标学习预测下一步。

Result: 实验显示PRISM在预测任务中表现优异，生成的序列反映真实的诊断路径和临床行为。

Conclusion: PRISM为序列化医疗建模奠定了基础，展示了生成语言模型在结构化医疗数据中的潜力。

Abstract: We introduce PRISM (Predictive Reasoning in Sequential Medicine), a
transformer-based architecture designed to model the sequential progression of
clinical decision-making processes. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on
isolated diagnostic classification, PRISM frames clinical trajectories as
tokenized sequences of events - including diagnostic tests, laboratory results,
and diagnoses - and learns to predict the most probable next steps in the
patient diagnostic journey. Leveraging a large custom clinical vocabulary and
an autoregressive training objective, PRISM demonstrates the ability to capture
complex dependencies across longitudinal patient timelines. Experimental
results show substantial improvements over random baselines in next-token
prediction tasks, with generated sequences reflecting realistic diagnostic
pathways, laboratory result progressions, and clinician ordering behaviors.
These findings highlight the feasibility of applying generative language
modeling techniques to structured medical event data, enabling applications in
clinical decision support, simulation, and education. PRISM establishes a
foundation for future advancements in sequence-based healthcare modeling,
bridging the gap between machine learning architectures and real-world
diagnostic reasoning.

TL;DR: RedDebate是一种多智能体辩论框架，通过LLM之间的对抗性论证自动识别和减少不安全行为，无需依赖人工评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI安全方法依赖人工或单模型评估，存在扩展性和监督风险。

Method: 利用多LLM协作辩论和红队测试，结合长期记忆模块。

Result: 辩论减少17.7%不安全行为，结合记忆模块后提升至23.5%。

Conclusion: RedDebate是首个结合多智能体辩论与红队测试的全自动AI安全框架。

Abstract: We propose RedDebate, a novel multi-agent debate framework that leverages
adversarial argumentation among Large Language Models (LLMs) to proactively
identify and mitigate their own unsafe behaviours. Existing AI safety methods
often depend heavily on costly human evaluations or isolated single-model
assessment, both subject to scalability constraints and oversight risks.
RedDebate instead embraces collaborative disagreement, enabling multiple LLMs
to critically examine one another's reasoning, and systematically uncovering
unsafe blind spots through automated red-teaming, and iteratively improve their
responses. We further integrate distinct types of long-term memory that retain
learned safety insights from debate interactions. Evaluating on established
safety benchmarks such as HarmBench, we demonstrate the proposed method's
effectiveness. Debate alone can reduce unsafe behaviours by 17.7%, and when
combined with long-term memory modules, achieves reductions exceeding 23.5%. To
our knowledge, RedDebate constitutes the first fully automated framework that
combines multi-agent debates with red-teaming to progressively enhance AI
safety without direct human intervention.(Github Repository:

TL;DR: 论文提出SPACE框架，通过编辑共享激活子空间同时提升LLMs的事实性和忠实性，解决了现有方法独立处理幻觉类型导致的性能权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在实际部署中因事实性和忠实性幻觉问题受限，现有方法独立处理这些问题时导致性能权衡。

Method: 通过激活空间动态分析，发现幻觉类型共享子空间，提出SPACE框架，结合谱聚类和注意力头显著性评分编辑共享子空间。

Result: 实验结果表明，SPACE在多个基准数据集上表现优越。

Conclusion: SPACE为同时缓解LLMs的事实性和忠实性幻觉提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities in natural language
processing, yet their practical deployment remains hindered by persistent
factuality and faithfulness hallucinations. While existing methods address
these hallucination types independently, they inadvertently induce performance
trade-offs, as interventions targeting one type often exacerbate the other.
Through empirical and theoretical analysis of activation space dynamics in
LLMs, we reveal that these hallucination categories share overlapping subspaces
within neural representations, presenting an opportunity for concurrent
mitigation. To harness this insight, we propose SPACE, a unified framework that
jointly enhances factuality and faithfulness by editing shared activation
subspaces. SPACE establishes a geometric foundation for shared subspace
existence through dual-task feature modeling, then identifies and edits these
subspaces via a hybrid probe strategy combining spectral clustering and
attention head saliency scoring. Experimental results across multiple benchmark
datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASR系统在通用转录任务上表现良好，但在识别罕见命名实体和适应领域不匹配时仍有困难。LLM因其大规模训练数据在多领域表现更优。

Method: 通过强化学习方法，利用LLM作为奖励模型，对ASR模型的假设进行评分，并以此作为奖励信号微调ASR模型。

Result: 相比传统自训练方法，命名实体的词错误率提升了21%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了ASR模型在领域适应和命名实体识别上的性能。

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have achieved strong performance
on general transcription tasks. However, they continue to struggle with
recognizing rare named entities and adapting to domain mismatches. In contrast,
large language models (LLMs), trained on massive internet-scale datasets, are
often more effective across a wide range of domains. In this work, we propose a
reinforcement learning based approach for unsupervised domain adaptation,
leveraging unlabeled data to enhance transcription quality, particularly the
named entities affected by domain mismatch, through feedback from a LLM. Given
contextual information, our framework employs a LLM as the reward model to
score the hypotheses from the ASR model. These scores serve as reward signals
to fine-tune the ASR model via reinforcement learning. Our method achieves a
21\% improvement on entity word error rate over conventional self-training
methods.

TL;DR: Dynamic Context Tuning (DCT) 扩展了 RAG，支持多轮对话和动态工具环境，无需重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有 RAG 系统局限于静态、单轮交互，不适合动态领域（如医疗和智能家居）。

Method: DCT 结合注意力缓存、LoRA 检索和上下文压缩，动态选择工具并跟踪信息。

Result: 实验显示 DCT 提升计划准确性 14%，减少幻觉 37%，成本显著低于 GPT-4。

Conclusion: DCT 可推广到未知工具，适用于广泛动态环境。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has significantly advanced large
language models (LLMs) by grounding their outputs in external tools and
knowledge sources. However, existing RAG systems are typically constrained to
static, single-turn interactions with fixed toolsets, making them ill-suited
for dynamic domains such as healthcare and smart homes, where user intent,
available tools, and contextual factors evolve over time. We present Dynamic
Context Tuning (DCT), a lightweight framework that extends RAG to support
multi-turn dialogue and evolving tool environments without requiring
retraining. DCT integrates an attention-based context cache to track relevant
past information, LoRA-based retrieval to dynamically select domain-specific
tools, and efficient context compression to maintain inputs within LLM context
limits. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks show that DCT
improves plan accuracy by 14% and reduces hallucinations by 37%, while matching
GPT-4 performance at significantly lower cost. Furthermore, DCT generalizes to
previously unseen tools, enabling scalable and adaptable AI assistants across a
wide range of dynamic environments.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence technology, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in the field of
Natural Language Processing (NLP), including areas such as content generation,
human-computer interaction, machine translation, and code generation, among
others. However, their widespread deployment has also raised significant safety
concerns. In recent years, LLM-generated content has occasionally exhibited
unsafe elements like toxicity and bias, particularly in adversarial scenarios,
which has garnered extensive attention from both academia and industry. While
numerous efforts have been made to evaluate the safety risks associated with
LLMs, there remains a lack of systematic reviews summarizing these research
endeavors. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive and systematic overview
of recent advancements in LLMs safety evaluation, focusing on several key
aspects: (1) "Why evaluate" that explores the background of LLMs safety
evaluation, how they differ from general LLMs evaluation, and the significance
of such evaluation; (2) "What to evaluate" that examines and categorizes
existing safety evaluation tasks based on key capabilities, including
dimensions such as toxicity, robustness, ethics, bias and fairness,
truthfulness, and so on; (3) "Where to evaluate" that summarizes the evaluation
metrics, datasets and benchmarks currently used in safety evaluations; (4) "How
to evaluate" that reviews existing evaluation toolkit, and categorizing
mainstream evaluation methods based on the roles of the evaluators. Finally, we
identify the challenges in LLMs safety evaluation and propose potential
research directions to promote further advancement in this field. We emphasize
the importance of prioritizing LLMs safety evaluation to ensure the safe
deployment of these models in real-world applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 读者好奇心对文本参与至关重要，但在NLP领域研究较少，论文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 利用BERTopic主题建模和持久同调性分析动态语义网络的拓扑特征（如连通组件、循环、空洞），将其作为信息缺口的代理变量。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了好奇心预测效果（解释偏差从30%提升至73%）。

Conclusion: 该框架为分析文本结构及其与读者参与的关系提供了新的计算方法。

Abstract: Reader curiosity, the drive to seek information, is crucial for textual
engagement, yet remains relatively underexplored in NLP. Building on
Loewenstein's Information Gap Theory, we introduce a framework that models
reader curiosity by quantifying semantic information gaps within a text's
semantic structure. Our approach leverages BERTopic-inspired topic modeling and
persistent homology to analyze the evolving topology (connected components,
cycles, voids) of a dynamic semantic network derived from text segments,
treating these features as proxies for information gaps. To empirically
evaluate this pipeline, we collect reader curiosity ratings from participants
(n = 49) as they read S. Collins's ''The Hunger Games'' novel. We then use the
topological features from our pipeline as independent variables to predict
these ratings, and experimentally show that they significantly improve
curiosity prediction compared to a baseline model (73% vs. 30% explained
deviance), validating our approach. This pipeline offers a new computational
method for analyzing text structure and its relation to reader engagement.

TL;DR: 论文提出C-SEO Bench基准，评估跨任务、领域和多参与者的C-SEO方法，发现现有方法效果有限，传统SEO策略更有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究C-SEO方法的广泛适用性和多参与者竞争场景下的效果，填补现有评估的局限性。

Method: 设计C-SEO Bench基准，涵盖问答和产品推荐任务，三个领域，并引入多参与者采用率的评估协议。

Result: 当前C-SEO方法效果不佳，传统SEO策略更有效；多参与者竞争导致收益递减。

Conclusion: C-SEO问题具有零和性质，传统SEO策略在LLM环境中更有效，需进一步研究优化方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming search engines into
Conversational Search Engines (CSE). Consequently, Search Engine Optimization
(SEO) is being shifted into Conversational Search Engine Optimization (C-SEO).
We are beginning to see dedicated C-SEO methods for modifying web documents to
increase their visibility in CSE responses. However, they are often tested only
for a limited breadth of application domains; we do not understand whether
certain C-SEO methods would be effective for a broad range of domains.
Moreover, existing evaluations consider only a single-actor scenario where only
one web document adopts a C-SEO method; in reality, multiple players are likely
to competitively adopt the cutting-edge C-SEO techniques, drawing an analogy
from the dynamics we have seen in SEO. We present C-SEO Bench, the first
benchmark designed to evaluate C-SEO methods across multiple tasks, domains,
and number of actors. We consider two search tasks, question answering and
product recommendation, with three domains each. We also formalize a new
evaluation protocol with varying adoption rates among involved actors. Our
experiments reveal that most current C-SEO methods are largely ineffective,
contrary to reported results in the literature. Instead, traditional SEO
strategies, those aiming to improve the ranking of the source in the LLM
context, are significantly more effective. We also observe that as we increase
the number of C-SEO adopters, the overall gains decrease, depicting a congested
and zero-sum nature of the problem. Our code and data are available at

TL;DR: 该研究利用基础模型分析自发语音，以非侵入性方式检测阿尔茨海默病及相关痴呆（ADRD），发现基于ASR的声学特征表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早期检测ADRD对干预和治疗至关重要，自发语音中的声学和语言标记可作为潜在生物标志物。

Method: 使用PREPARE Challenge数据集，筛选703例健康对照、81例轻度认知障碍和405例AD病例，测试多种开源语音和语言模型的分类性能。

Result: Whisper-medium模型在语音模型中表现最佳（准确率0.731），BERT在语言模型中领先（准确率0.662）。ASR生成的声学嵌入效果最优。

Conclusion: 基础模型结合声学特征为ADRD早期检测提供了可扩展、非侵入且经济的方法。

Abstract: Background: Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) are progressive
neurodegenerative conditions where early detection is vital for timely
intervention and care. Spontaneous speech contains rich acoustic and linguistic
markers that may serve as non-invasive biomarkers for cognitive decline.
Foundation models, pre-trained on large-scale audio or text data, produce
high-dimensional embeddings encoding contextual and acoustic features.
  Methods: We used the PREPARE Challenge dataset, which includes audio
recordings from over 1,600 participants with three cognitive statuses: healthy
control (HC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). We
excluded non-English, non-spontaneous, or poor-quality recordings. The final
dataset included 703 (59.13%) HC, 81 (6.81%) MCI, and 405 (34.06%) AD cases. We
benchmarked a range of open-source foundation speech and language models to
classify cognitive status into the three categories.
  Results: The Whisper-medium model achieved the highest performance among
speech models (accuracy = 0.731, AUC = 0.802). Among language models, BERT with
pause annotation performed best (accuracy = 0.662, AUC = 0.744). ADRD detection
using state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR) model-generated audio
embeddings outperformed others. Including non-semantic features like pause
patterns consistently improved text-based classification.
  Conclusion: This study introduces a benchmarking framework using foundation

particularly ASR-derived embeddings -- demonstrate strong potential for
scalable, non-invasive, and cost-effective early detection of ADRD.

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs), such as GPT, Gemini, and
DeepSeek, has significantly advanced natural language processing, giving rise
to sophisticated chatbots capable of diverse language-related tasks. The
transition from these traditional LLM chatbots to more advanced AI agents
represents a pivotal evolutionary step. However, existing evaluation frameworks
often blur the distinctions between LLM chatbots and AI agents, leading to
confusion among researchers selecting appropriate benchmarks. To bridge this
gap, this paper introduces a systematic analysis of current evaluation
approaches, grounded in an evolutionary perspective. We provide a detailed
analytical framework that clearly differentiates AI agents from LLM chatbots
along five key aspects: complex environment, multi-source instructor, dynamic
feedback, multi-modal perception, and advanced capability. Further, we
categorize existing evaluation benchmarks based on external environments
driving forces, and resulting advanced internal capabilities. For each
category, we delineate relevant evaluation attributes, presented
comprehensively in practical reference tables. Finally, we synthesize current
trends and outline future evaluation methodologies through four critical
lenses: environment, agent, evaluator, and metrics. Our findings offer
actionable guidance for researchers, facilitating the informed selection and
application of benchmarks in AI agent evaluation, thus fostering continued
advancement in this rapidly evolving research domain.

TL;DR: SUTA-LM结合了基于熵最小化的TTA方法和语言模型重评分，解决了TTA与语言模型结合的挑战，并在18个ASR数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决端到端ASR在现实领域不匹配时的性能下降问题，特别是TTA与语言模型结合时的干扰问题。

Method: 提出SUTA-LM，通过自动步长选择机制控制适应过程，结合声学和语言信息，再进行语言模型重评分。

Result: 在18个多样化的ASR数据集上实现了稳健的性能。

Conclusion: SUTA-LM是一种简单有效的方法，能够广泛适用于不同领域。

Abstract: Despite progress in end-to-end ASR, real-world domain mismatches still cause
performance drops, which Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) aims to mitigate by
adjusting models during inference. Recent work explores combining TTA with
external language models, using techniques like beam search rescoring or
generative error correction. In this work, we identify a previously overlooked
challenge: TTA can interfere with language model rescoring, revealing the
nontrivial nature of effectively combining the two methods. Based on this
insight, we propose SUTA-LM, a simple yet effective extension of SUTA, an
entropy-minimization-based TTA approach, with language model rescoring. SUTA-LM
first applies a controlled adaptation process guided by an auto-step selection
mechanism leveraging both acoustic and linguistic information, followed by
language model rescoring to refine the outputs. Experiments on 18 diverse ASR
datasets show that SUTA-LM achieves robust results across a wide range of
domains.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出ManyICL方法，通过将上下文学习扩展到多样本设置，显著缩小了与专用微调的性能差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前上下文学习方法在多任务处理中性能仍落后于专用微调，且存在效率低下和灾难性遗忘问题。

Method: 提出ManyICL，将上下文中的每个答案作为监督训练目标，优化长序列处理效率。

Result: ManyICL在多任务中表现优于零/少样本微调，接近专用微调性能，并减轻灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: ManyICL是一种高效的多任务学习方法，性能接近专用微调，且代码将公开。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) possess a remarkable ability to perform
in-context learning (ICL), which enables them to handle multiple downstream
tasks simultaneously without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. Recent
studies have shown that even moderately sized LLMs, such as Mistral 7B, Gemma
7B and Llama-3 8B, can achieve ICL through few-shot in-context fine-tuning of
all tasks at once. However, this approach still lags behind dedicated
fine-tuning, where a separate model is trained for each individual task.
  In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Many-Shot In-Context Fine-tuning
(ManyICL), which significantly narrows this performance gap by extending the
principles of ICL to a many-shot setting. To unlock the full potential of
ManyICL and address the inherent inefficiency of processing long sequences with
numerous in-context examples, we propose a novel training objective. Instead of
solely predicting the final answer, our approach treats every answer within the
context as a supervised training target. This effectively shifts the role of
many-shot examples from prompts to targets for autoregressive learning. Through
extensive experiments on diverse downstream tasks, including classification,
summarization, question answering, natural language inference, and math, we
demonstrate that ManyICL substantially outperforms zero/few-shot fine-tuning
and approaches the performance of dedicated fine-tuning. Furthermore, ManyICL
significantly mitigates catastrophic forgetting issues observed in
zero/few-shot fine-tuning. The code will be made publicly available upon
publication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源或特定领域ASR性能提升的挑战，减少对标注数据的依赖。

Method: 利用现有ASR模型生成伪标签，训练高保真TTS系统，合成语音-文本对并反馈至ASR系统。

Result: 在台湾普通话上验证，错误率降低20%（普通话）和50%（中英混合）。

Conclusion: 该框架为低资源或特定领域ASR性能提升提供了实用路径。

Abstract: We propose a self-refining framework that enhances ASR performance with only
unlabeled datasets. The process starts with an existing ASR model generating
pseudo-labels on unannotated speech, which are then used to train a
high-fidelity text-to-speech (TTS) system. Then, synthesized speech text pairs
are bootstrapped into the original ASR system, completing the closed-loop
self-improvement cycle. We demonstrated the effectiveness of the framework on
Taiwanese Mandarin speech. Leveraging 6,000 hours of unlabeled speech, a
moderate amount of text data, and synthetic content from the AI models, we
adapt Whisper-large-v2 into a specialized model, Twister. Twister reduces error
rates by up to 20% on Mandarin and 50% on Mandarin-English code-switching
benchmarks compared to Whisper. Results highlight the framework as a compelling
alternative to pseudo-labeling self-distillation approaches and provides a
practical pathway for improving ASR performance in low-resource or
domain-specific settings.

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态稀疏注意力机制（DAM），通过自适应掩码解决长上下文任务中静态稀疏注意力的局限性，提升计算效率且无需预定义掩码结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长上下文理解对NLP应用至关重要，但传统Transformer的自注意力机制因二次复杂度效率低下，而现有稀疏注意力方法因静态掩码无法捕捉异质注意力模式，导致性能受限。

Method: 引入动态稀疏注意力机制，在注意力图级别分配自适应掩码，保留各层和头的异质模式，无需微调或预定义掩码结构。

Result: 该方法与全注意力模型对齐度高，显著降低内存和计算开销，同时保持检索性能，适用于大规模语言模型部署。

Conclusion: DAM为长序列任务提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案，平衡了计算效率与模型性能。

Abstract: Long-context understanding is crucial for many NLP applications, yet
transformers struggle with efficiency due to the quadratic complexity of
self-attention. Sparse attention methods alleviate this cost but often impose
static, predefined masks, failing to capture heterogeneous attention patterns.
This results in suboptimal token interactions, limiting adaptability and
retrieval accuracy in long-sequence tasks. This work introduces a dynamic
sparse attention mechanism that assigns adaptive masks at the attention-map
level, preserving heterogeneous patterns across layers and heads. Unlike
existing approaches, our method eliminates the need for fine-tuning and
predefined mask structures while maintaining computational efficiency. By
learning context-aware attention structures, it achieves high alignment with
full-attention models, ensuring minimal performance degradation while reducing
memory and compute overhead. This approach provides a scalable alternative to
full attention, enabling the practical deployment of large-scale Large Language
Models (LLMs) without sacrificing retrieval performance. DAM is available at:

Method: 通过测量神经元重要性进行剪枝，再结合量化技术压缩模型，并在医疗基准测试中验证性能。

Result: 成功将Gemma和LLaMA3模型压缩50%和67%，在低功耗设备上实现高效推理。

Conclusion: 该压缩框架为LLMs在资源受限环境中的部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significant impact on the healthcare
scenarios but remain prohibitively large for deployment in real-time,
resource-constrained environments such as edge devices. In this work, we
introduce a novel medical assistant system, optimized through our
general-purpose compression framework, which tailors Large Language Models
(LLMs) for deployment in specialized domains. By measuring neuron saliency on
domain-specific data, our method can aggressively prune irrelevant neurons,
reducing model size while preserving performance. Following pruning, we apply
post-training quantization to further reduce the memory footprint, and evaluate
the compressed model across medical benchmarks including MedMCQA, MedQA, and
PubMedQA. We also deploy the 50\% compressed Gemma and the 67\% compressed
LLaMA3 models on Jetson Orin Nano (18.7W peak) and Raspberry Pi 5 (6.3W peak),
achieving real-time, energy-efficient inference under hardware constraints.

TL;DR: PankRAG框架通过全局感知的分层查询解析和依赖感知的重新排序机制，解决了传统基于图的RAG方法中实体提取的局限性，显著提升了检索和生成的质量。


<details>

Motivation: 传统基于图的RAG方法仅依赖实体提取，容易忽略潜在关键信息，导致检索内容不相关或矛盾，增加幻觉风险。

Method: PankRAG采用分层查询解析策略和依赖感知的重新排序机制，构建多级解析路径并利用依赖结构优化检索结果。

Result: 实验证明PankRAG在多个基准测试中优于现有方法，展示了其鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: PankRAG通过结构化推理和依赖感知机制，显著提升了RAG系统的性能，解决了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Contemporary graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods
typically begin by extracting entities from user queries and then leverage
pre-constructed knowledge graphs to retrieve related relationships and
metadata. However, this pipeline's exclusive reliance on entity-level
extraction can lead to the misinterpretation or omission of latent yet critical
information and relations. As a result, retrieved content may be irrelevant or
contradictory, and essential knowledge may be excluded, exacerbating
hallucination risks and degrading the fidelity of generated responses. To
address these limitations, we introduce PankRAG, a framework that combines a
globally aware, hierarchical query-resolution strategy with a novel
dependency-aware reranking mechanism. PankRAG first constructs a multi-level
resolution path that captures both parallel and sequential interdependencies
within a query, guiding large language models (LLMs) through structured
reasoning. It then applies its dependency-aware reranker to exploit the
dependency structure among resolved sub-questions, enriching and validating
retrieval results for subsequent sub-questions. Empirical evaluations
demonstrate that PankRAG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches
across multiple benchmarks, underscoring its robustness and generalizability.

Conclusion: CAGSR-vLLM-MTC为多轮对话和链式推理提供了有效解决方案，未来可扩展至多方对话和分层推理。

Abstract: We present CAGSR-vLLM-MTC, an extension of our Self-Supervised
Cross-Attention-Guided Reinforcement (CAGSR) framework, now implemented on the
high-performance vLLM runtime, to address both multi-turn dialogue and
chain-of-thought reasoning. Building upon our original single-turn approach, we
first instrumented vLLM's C++/CUDA kernels to asynchronously capture per-layer,
per-head cross-attention weights during generation. We then generalized our
self-supervised reward function to accumulate attention signals over entire
conversation histories and intermediate chain-of-thought steps. We discuss
practical trade-offs, including an entropy-based clamping mechanism to prevent
attention collapse on early context, and outline future directions for
multi-party dialogues and hierarchical reasoning.

Motivation: 现有方法在定位语义表示和移动信号建模方面存在不足，限制了LLM在移动数据分析中的应用。

Method: 提出QT-Mob框架，包括定位标记化模块和多目标微调策略，以增强LLM对移动数据的理解。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上，QT-Mob在下一位置预测和移动恢复任务中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: QT-Mob不仅提升了LLM对移动数据的解释能力，还为移动分析任务提供了更通用的解决方案。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of location-based services has led to the generation
of vast amounts of mobility data, providing significant opportunities to model
user movement dynamics within urban environments. Recent advancements have
focused on adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) for mobility analytics.
However, existing methods face two primary limitations: inadequate semantic
representation of locations (i.e., discrete IDs) and insufficient modeling of
mobility signals within LLMs (i.e., single templated instruction fine-tuning).
To address these issues, we propose QT-Mob, a novel framework that
significantly enhances LLMs for mobility analytics. QT-Mob introduces a
location tokenization module that learns compact, semantically rich tokens to
represent locations, preserving contextual information while ensuring
compatibility with LLMs. Furthermore, QT-Mob incorporates a series of
complementary fine-tuning objectives that align the learned tokens with the
internal representations in LLMs, improving the model's comprehension of
sequential movement patterns and location semantics. The proposed QT-Mob
framework not only enhances LLMs' ability to interpret mobility data but also
provides a more generalizable approach for various mobility analytics tasks.
Experiments on three real-world dataset demonstrate the superior performance in
both next-location prediction and mobility recovery tasks, outperforming
existing deep learning and LLM-based methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在用户对事实表述方向不同时的一致性，填补现有基准的空白。

Method: 从FEVEROUS数据集中采样事实，构建两种表述（用户声称正确或错误），记录模型的同意和推理。

Result: 通过分层分析，隔离表述影响，评估模型是否坚持其事实判断。

Conclusion: AssertBench旨在衡量LLMs在面对矛盾用户表述时的一致性能力。

Abstract: Recent benchmarks have probed factual consistency and rhetorical robustness
in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, a knowledge gap exists regarding how
directional framing of factually true statements influences model agreement, a
common scenario for LLM users. AssertBench addresses this by sampling
evidence-supported facts from FEVEROUS, a fact verification dataset. For each
(evidence-backed) fact, we construct two framing prompts: one where the user
claims the statement is factually correct, and another where the user claims it
is incorrect. We then record the model's agreement and reasoning. The desired
outcome is that the model asserts itself, maintaining consistent truth
evaluation across both framings, rather than switching its evaluation to agree
with the user. AssertBench isolates framing-induced variability from the
model's underlying factual knowledge by stratifying results based on the
model's accuracy on the same claims when presented neutrally. In doing so, this
benchmark aims to measure an LLM's ability to "stick to its guns" when
presented with contradictory user assertions about the same fact. The complete
source code is available at https://github.com/achowd32/assert-bench.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained enormous attention in recent years
due to their capability of understanding and generating natural languages. With
the rapid development and wild-range applications (e.g., Agents, Embodied
Intelligence), the robustness of LLMs has received increased attention. As the
core brain of many AI applications, the robustness of LLMs requires that models
should not only generate consistent contents, but also ensure the correctness
and stability of generated content when dealing with unexpeted application
scenarios (e.g., toxic prompts, limited noise domain data, outof-distribution
(OOD) applications, etc). In this survey paper, we conduct a thorough review of
the robustness of LLMs, aiming to provide a comprehensive terminology of
concepts and methods around this field and facilitate the community.
Specifically, we first give a formal definition of LLM robustness and present
the collection protocol of this survey paper. Then, based on the types of
perturbated inputs, we organize this survey from the following perspectives: 1)
Adversarial Robustness: tackling the problem that prompts are manipulated
intentionally, such as noise prompts, long context, data attack, etc; 2) OOD
Robustness: dealing with the unexpected real-world application scenarios, such
as OOD detection, zero-shot transferring, hallucinations, etc; 3) Evaluation of
Robustness: summarizing the new evaluation datasets, metrics, and tools for
verifying the robustness of LLMs. After reviewing the representative work from
each perspective, we discuss and highlight future opportunities and research
directions in this field. Meanwhile, we also organize related works and provide
an easy-to-search project

susceptibility to textual adversarial attacks raises reliability concerns. This
paper investigates the robustness of LLMs used as automated reviewers in the
presence of such attacks. We focus on three key questions: (1) The
effectiveness of LLMs in generating reviews compared to human reviewers. (2)
The impact of adversarial attacks on the reliability of LLM-generated reviews.
(3) Challenges and potential mitigation strategies for LLM-based review. Our
evaluation reveals significant vulnerabilities, as text manipulations can
distort LLM assessments. We offer a comprehensive evaluation of LLM performance
in automated peer reviewing and analyze its robustness against adversarial
attacks. Our findings emphasize the importance of addressing adversarial risks
to ensure AI strengthens, rather than compromises, the integrity of scholarly

Conclusion: KokushiMD-10为多语言和多模态医疗AI的评估提供了全面资源，凸显医疗AI仍面临挑战。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated notable
performance in medical licensing exams. However, comprehensive evaluation of
LLMs across various healthcare roles, particularly in high-stakes clinical
scenarios, remains a challenge. Existing benchmarks are typically text-based,
English-centric, and focus primarily on medicines, which limits their ability
to assess broader healthcare knowledge and multimodal reasoning. To address
these gaps, we introduce KokushiMD-10, the first multimodal benchmark
constructed from ten Japanese national healthcare licensing exams. This
benchmark spans multiple fields, including Medicine, Dentistry, Nursing,
Pharmacy, and allied health professions. It contains over 11588 real exam
questions, incorporating clinical images and expert-annotated rationales to
evaluate both textual and visual reasoning. We benchmark over 30
state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, and Gemini, across both
text and image-based settings. Despite promising results, no model consistently
meets passing thresholds across domains, highlighting the ongoing challenges in
medical AI. KokushiMD-10 provides a comprehensive and linguistically grounded
resource for evaluating and advancing reasoning-centric medical AI across

Result: MATTER在生成和分类任务中分别平均提升4%和2%的性能。

Conclusion: 领域知识对科学文本处理中的标记化策略至关重要。

Abstract: While language models are increasingly utilized in materials science, typical
models rely on frequency-centric tokenization methods originally developed for
natural language processing. However, these methods frequently produce
excessive fragmentation and semantic loss, failing to maintain the structural
and semantic integrity of material concepts. To address this issue, we propose
MATTER, a novel tokenization approach that integrates material knowledge into
tokenization. Based on MatDetector trained on our materials knowledge base and
a re-ranking method prioritizing material concepts in token merging, MATTER
maintains the structural integrity of identified material concepts and prevents
fragmentation during tokenization, ensuring their semantic meaning remains
intact. The experimental results demonstrate that MATTER outperforms existing
tokenization methods, achieving an average performance gain of $4\%$ and $2\%$
in the generation and classification tasks, respectively. These results
underscore the importance of domain knowledge for tokenization strategies in
scientific text processing. Our code is available at

Conclusion: Infinity-Instruct展示了基础和聊天训练的协同效应，为LLM开发提供了新思路，数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance in real-world
applications, yet existing open-source instruction datasets often concentrate
on narrow domains, such as mathematics or coding, limiting generalization and
widening the gap with proprietary models. To bridge this gap, we introduce
Infinity-Instruct, a high-quality instruction dataset designed to enhance both
foundational and chat capabilities of LLMs through a two-phase pipeline. In
Phase 1, we curate 7.4M high-quality foundational instructions
(InfInstruct-F-7.4M) from over 100M samples using hybrid data selection
techniques. In Phase 2, we synthesize 1.5M high-quality chat instructions
(InfInstruct-G-1.5M) through a two-stage process involving instruction
selection, evolution, and diagnostic filtering. We empirically evaluate
Infinity-Instruct by fine-tuning several open-source models, including Mistral,
LLaMA, Qwen, and Yi, and observe substantial performance gains across both
foundational and instruction following benchmarks, consistently surpassing
official instruction-tuned counterparts. Notably, InfInstruct-LLaMA3.1-70B
outperforms GPT-4-0314 by 8.6\% on instruction following tasks while achieving
comparable foundational performance. These results underscore the synergy
between foundational and chat training and offer new insights into holistic LLM
development. Our
dataset\footnote{https://huggingface.co/datasets/BAAI/Infinity-Instruct} and
codes\footnote{https://gitee.com/li-touch/infinity-instruct} have been publicly

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ScIRGen是一个科学QA与检索数据集生成框架，旨在更准确地反映科研人员的信息需求，生成了61k规模的ScIRGen-Geo数据集，并验证了现有方法在复杂问题上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有科学检索和QA数据集通常处理简单问题，与真实科研需求不匹配，因此需要开发更贴近实际信息需求的数据集。

Method: 设计了基于学术论文的数据集信息提取方法，结合认知分类法生成高质量问题，并利用LLM困惑度变化自动筛选合成答案。

Result: 生成了61k规模的ScIRGen-Geo数据集，并发现现有方法在复杂问题推理上仍有不足。

Conclusion: ScIRGen框架为科学社区提供了更复杂的工具支持，推动了满足科研信息需求的技术发展。

Abstract: Scientific researchers need intensive information about datasets to
effectively evaluate and develop theories and methodologies. The information
needs regarding datasets are implicitly embedded in particular research tasks,
rather than explicitly expressed in search queries. However, existing
scientific retrieval and question-answering (QA) datasets typically address
straightforward questions, which do not align with the distribution of
real-world research inquiries. To bridge this gap, we developed ScIRGen, a
dataset generation framework for scientific QA \& retrieval that more
accurately reflects the information needs of professional science researchers,
and uses it to create a large-scale scientific retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) dataset with realistic queries, datasets and papers. Technically, we
designed a dataset-oriented information extraction method that leverages
academic papers to augment the dataset representation. We then proposed a
question generation framework by employing cognitive taxonomy to ensure the
quality of synthesized questions. We also design a method to automatically
filter synthetic answers based on the perplexity shift of LLMs, which is highly
aligned with human judgment of answers' validity. Collectively, these
methodologies culminated in the creation of the 61k QA dataset, ScIRGen-Geo. We
benchmarked representative methods on the ScIRGen-Geo dataset for their
question-answering and retrieval capabilities, finding out that current methods
still suffer from reasoning from complex questions. This work advances the
development of more sophisticated tools to support the intricate information
needs of the scientific community.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种在剪枝阶段引入自蒸馏损失的方法，以更准确地利用原始模型的预测信息，同时专注于剪枝MLP模块，显著压缩LLM而不明显降低性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs性能强大，但部署成本高昂。现有基于梯度的剪枝方法忽略了生成能力的关键信息。

Method: 在剪枝阶段引入自蒸馏损失，专注于剪枝MLP模块。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著优于现有剪枝方法，并在1B规模开源LLMs中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法有效压缩LLM且性能损失小，代码和权重已开源。

Abstract: In spite of strong performance achieved by LLMs, the costs of their
deployment are unaffordable. For the compression of LLMs, gradient-based
pruning methods present promising effectiveness. However, in these methods, the
gradient computation with one-hot labels ignore the potential predictions on
other words, thus missing key information for generative capability of the
original model. To address this issue, we introduce a self-distillation loss
during the pruning phase (rather than post-training) to fully exploit the
predictions of the original model, thereby obtaining more accurate gradient
information for pruning. Moreover, we find that, compared to attention modules,
the predictions of LLM are less sensitive to multilayer perceptron (MLP)
modules, which take up more than $5 \times$ parameters (LLaMA3.2-1.2B). To this
end, we focus on the pruning of MLP modules, to significantly compress LLM
without obvious performance degradation. Experimental results on extensive
zero-shot benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
existing pruning methods. Furthermore, our method achieves very competitive
performance among 1B-scale open source LLMs. The source code and trained
weights are available at https://github.com/visresearch/SDMPrune.

TL;DR: 论文提出ASRJam和EchoGuard框架，通过对抗性扰动和自然失真干扰ASR系统，防止语音钓鱼攻击，同时不影响人类通话体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音钓鱼攻击利用LLM、TTS和ASR技术规模化且逼真，ASR转录环节是其最脆弱的部分，需开发有效防御手段。

Method: 提出ASRJam框架，注入对抗性扰动干扰ASR；进一步设计EchoGuard，利用自然失真（如回声）破坏ASR但人类可容忍。

Result: 39人用户研究表明，EchoGuard在ASR干扰和人类听觉体验上综合表现最佳。

Conclusion: EchoGuard提供了一种高效且实用的防御方案，适用于实时语音钓鱼防御。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), combined with Text-to-Speech (TTS) and
Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), are increasingly used to automate voice
phishing (vishing) scams. These systems are scalable and convincing, posing a
significant security threat. We identify the ASR transcription step as the most
vulnerable link in the scam pipeline and introduce ASRJam, a proactive defence
framework that injects adversarial perturbations into the victim's audio to
disrupt the attacker's ASR. This breaks the scam's feedback loop without
affecting human callers, who can still understand the conversation. While prior
adversarial audio techniques are often unpleasant and impractical for real-time
use, we also propose EchoGuard, a novel jammer that leverages natural
distortions, such as reverberation and echo, that are disruptive to ASR but
tolerable to humans. To evaluate EchoGuard's effectiveness and usability, we
conducted a 39-person user study comparing it with three state-of-the-art
attacks. Results show that EchoGuard achieved the highest overall utility,
offering the best combination of ASR disruption and human listening experience.

TL;DR: GUIRoboTron-Speech是首个端到端的自主GUI代理，直接接受语音指令和屏幕截图预测动作，解决了文本指令在无手操作中的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前GUI代理依赖文本指令，限制了无障碍性和便利性，特别是在无手操作场景中。

Method: 利用随机音色TTS模型生成高质量语音指令，通过渐进式训练和启发式混合指令策略解决模态不平衡问题。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上验证了GUIRoboTron-Speech的鲁棒性和优越性能。

Conclusion: 语音作为GUI代理的指令模态具有显著潜力和广泛应用前景。

Abstract: Autonomous agents for Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) are revolutionizing
human-computer interaction, yet their reliance on text-based instructions
imposes limitations on accessibility and convenience, particularly in
hands-free scenarios. To address this gap, we propose GUIRoboTron-Speech, the
first end-to-end autonomous GUI agent that directly accepts speech instructions
and on-device screenshots to predict actions. Confronted with the scarcity of
speech-based GUI agent datasets, we initially generated high-quality speech
instructions for training by leveraging a random timbre text-to-speech (TTS)
model to convert existing text instructions. We then develop
GUIRoboTron-Speech's capabilities through progressive grounding and planning
training stages. A key contribution is a heuristic mixed-instruction training
strategy designed to mitigate the modality imbalance inherent in pre-trained
foundation models. Comprehensive experiments on several benchmark datasets
validate the robust and superior performance of GUIRoboTron-Speech,
demonstrating the significant potential and widespread applicability of speech
as an effective instruction modality for driving GUI agents. Our code and
datasets are available at https://github.com/GUIRoboTron/GUIRoboTron-Speech.

TL;DR: 研究发现，随着语言模型能力的提升，其错误模式逐渐趋近于人类推理的典型误区，而非完全理性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究语言模型在推理能力提升过程中是否趋近于人类推理模式，尤其是错误模式。

Method: 使用Erotetic Theory of Reasoning (ETR)框架和PyETR工具生成逻辑推理问题，评估38个语言模型在383个任务中的表现。

Result: 模型能力提升时，其错误答案与ETR预测的人类误区相关性增强（ρ=0.360, p=0.0265），但逻辑正确性未提升。

Conclusion: 语言模型的推理模式趋近于人类认知，包括偏见和局限性，而非完全理性。

Abstract: Do language models converge toward human-like reasoning patterns as they
improve? We provide surprising evidence that while overall reasoning
capabilities increase with model sophistication, the nature of errors
increasingly mirrors predictable human reasoning fallacies: a previously
unobserved inverse scaling phenomenon. To investigate this question, we apply
the Erotetic Theory of Reasoning (ETR), a formal cognitive framework with
empirical support for predicting human reasoning outcomes. Using the
open-source package PyETR, we generate logical reasoning problems where humans
predictably err, evaluating responses from 38 language models across 383
reasoning tasks. Our analysis indicates that as models advance in general
capability (as measured by Chatbot Arena scores), the proportion of their
incorrect answers that align with ETR-predicted human fallacies tends to
increase ($\rho = 0.360, p = 0.0265$). Notably, as we observe no correlation
between model sophistication and logical correctness on these tasks, this shift
in error patterns toward human-likeness occurs independently of error rate.
These findings challenge the prevailing view that scaling language models
naturally obtains normative rationality, suggesting instead a convergence
toward human-like cognition inclusive of our characteristic biases and
limitations, as we further confirm by demonstrating order-effects in language
model reasoning.

Conclusion: CHECK为LLM在医疗等高风险领域的应用提供了可扩展且安全的基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise in healthcare, but hallucinations
remain a major barrier to clinical use. We present CHECK, a continuous-learning
framework that integrates structured clinical databases with a classifier
grounded in information theory to detect both factual and reasoning-based
hallucinations. Evaluated on 1500 questions from 100 pivotal clinical trials,
CHECK reduced LLama3.3-70B-Instruct hallucination rates from 31% to 0.3% -
making an open source model state of the art. Its classifier generalized across
medical benchmarks, achieving AUCs of 0.95-0.96, including on the MedQA (USMLE)
benchmark and HealthBench realistic multi-turn medical questioning. By
leveraging hallucination probabilities to guide GPT-4o's refinement and
judiciously escalate compute, CHECK boosted its USMLE passing rate by 5
percentage points, achieving a state-of-the-art 92.1%. By suppressing
hallucinations below accepted clinical error thresholds, CHECK offers a
scalable foundation for safe LLM deployment in medicine and other high-stakes
domains.

Abstract: Emergence is a concept in complexity science that describes how many-body
systems manifest novel higher-level properties, properties that can be
described by replacing high-dimensional mechanisms with lower-dimensional

different". Intelligence is a consummate emergent property manifesting
increasingly efficient -- cheaper and faster -- uses of emergent capabilities
to solve problems. This is captured by the idea "less is more". In this paper,
we first examine claims that Large Language Models exhibit emergent
capabilities, reviewing several approaches to quantifying emergence, and
secondly ask whether LLMs possess emergent intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录中的药物停用信息对患者安全至关重要，但常埋没于非结构化文本中，需高效自动化工具提取。

Method: 收集三个EHR数据集，评估12种LLMs，采用多种提示策略，比较药物提取、状态分类及联合任务的性能。

Result: GPT-4o在零样本下表现最优（提取F1 94.0%，分类78.1%，联合任务72.7%），开源模型紧随其后。医学专用LLMs表现较差，少样本学习可提升性能。

Conclusion: LLMs在EHR药物信息提取与停用分类中潜力显著，开源模型可替代专有系统，少样本学习能进一步提升能力。

Abstract: Identifying medication discontinuations in electronic health records (EHRs)
is vital for patient safety but is often hindered by information being buried
in unstructured notes. This study aims to evaluate the capabilities of advanced
open-sourced and proprietary large language models (LLMs) in extracting
medications and classifying their medication status from EHR notes, focusing on
their scalability on medication information extraction without human
annotation. We collected three EHR datasets from diverse sources to build the
evaluation benchmark. We evaluated 12 advanced LLMs and explored multiple LLM
prompting strategies. Performance on medication extraction, medication status
classification, and their joint task (extraction then classification) was
systematically compared across all experiments. We found that LLMs showed
promising performance on the medication extraction and discontinuation
classification from EHR notes. GPT-4o consistently achieved the highest average
F1 scores in all tasks under zero-shot setting - 94.0% for medication
extraction, 78.1% for discontinuation classification, and 72.7% for the joint
task. Open-sourced models followed closely, Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct achieved the
highest performance in medication status classification on the MIV-Med dataset
(68.7%) and in the joint task on both the Re-CASI (76.2%) and MIV-Med (60.2%)
datasets. Medical-specific LLMs demonstrated lower performance compared to
advanced general-domain LLMs. Few-shot learning generally improved performance,
while CoT reasoning showed inconsistent gains. LLMs demonstrate strong
potential for medication extraction and discontinuation identification on EHR
notes, with open-sourced models offering scalable alternatives to proprietary
systems and few-shot can further improve LLMs' capability.

Motivation: 研究旨在探索在全球南方计算资源有限的研究环境中，小模型是否仍能有效参与高性能任务。

Method: 使用参数少于10亿的小模型，并在低预算GPU或无GPU的计算机上运行。

Result: 模型在五个赛道中与优胜者的F1分数差距为6.46至13.13分，表现具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 小模型在资源受限环境下仍能有效完成任务，适合计算资源有限的研究机构。

Abstract: In this paper, we present the RETUYT-INCO participation at the BEA 2025
shared task. Our participation was characterized by the decision of using
relatively small models, with fewer than 1B parameters. This self-imposed
restriction tries to represent the conditions in which many research labs or
institutions are in the Global South, where computational power is not easily
accessible due to its prohibitive cost. Even under this restrictive
self-imposed setting, our models managed to stay competitive with the rest of
teams that participated in the shared task. According to the $exact\ F_1$
scores published by the organizers, the performance gaps between our models and
the winners were as follows: $6.46$ in Track 1; $10.24$ in Track 2; $7.85$ in
Track 3; $9.56$ in Track 4; and $13.13$ in Track 5. Considering that the
minimum difference with a winner team is $6.46$ points -- and the maximum
difference is $13.13$ -- according to the $exact\ F_1$ score, we find that
models with a size smaller than 1B parameters are competitive for these tasks,
all of which can be run on computers with a low-budget GPU or even without a
GPU.

Motivation: 多语言表示使相似含义的词共享语义空间，但现有去偏方法无法利用这一优势，因为它们仅针对单语言操作。

Method: 提出IMSAE方法，通过迭代SVD截断识别和缓解多语言的联合偏置子空间。

Result: 在八种语言和五个维度上验证了IMSAE的有效性，尤其在零样本设置下表现优异。

Conclusion: IMSAE在多种语言模型中优于传统方法，同时保持模型实用性。

Abstract: Multilingual representations embed words with similar meanings to share a
common semantic space across languages, creating opportunities to transfer
debiasing effects between languages. However, existing methods for debiasing
are unable to exploit this opportunity because they operate on individual
languages. We present Iterative Multilingual Spectral Attribute Erasure
(IMSAE), which identifies and mitigates joint bias subspaces across multiple
languages through iterative SVD-based truncation. Evaluating IMSAE across eight
languages and five demographic dimensions, we demonstrate its effectiveness in
both standard and zero-shot settings, where target language data is
unavailable, but linguistically similar languages can be used for debiasing.
Our comprehensive experiments across diverse language models (BERT, LLaMA,
Mistral) show that IMSAE outperforms traditional monolingual and cross-lingual
approaches while maintaining model utility.

Result: SEAR在所有表类型中表现优于基线方法，且表结构重构能提升推理性能。

Conclusion: SEAR是一种有效的自适应提示框架，适用于多样化表推理任务。

Abstract: Temporal Table Reasoning is a critical challenge for Large Language Models
(LLMs), requiring effective prompting techniques to extract relevant insights.
Despite existence of multiple prompting methods, their impact on table
reasoning remains largely unexplored. Furthermore, the performance of these
models varies drastically across different table and context structures, making
it difficult to determine an optimal approach. This work investigates multiple
prompting technique across diverse table types to determine optimal approaches
for different scenarios. We find that performance varies based on entity type,
table structure, requirement of additional context and question complexity,
with NO single method consistently outperforming others. To mitigate these
challenges, we introduce SEAR, an adaptive prompting framework inspired by
human reasoning that dynamically adjusts based on context characteristics and
integrates a structured reasoning. Our results demonstrate that SEAR achieves
superior performance across all table types compared to other baseline
prompting techniques. Additionally, we explore the impact of table structure
refactoring, finding that a unified representation enhances model's reasoning.

Motivation: 探索是否可以通过学习专用的继续思考标记来触发更长的推理步骤，以提升语言模型的性能。

Method: 在蒸馏版DeepSeek-R1中引入单一学习标记，仅通过强化学习训练其嵌入，同时冻结模型权重。

Result: 学习标记在数学基准测试中比基线模型和固定标记方法（如"Wait"）表现更好，例如在GSM8K上提升4.2%。

Conclusion: 专用学习标记比固定标记更有效，能显著提升模型推理能力。

Abstract: Test-time scaling has emerged as an effective approach for improving language
model performance by utilizing additional compute at inference time. Recent
studies have shown that overriding end-of-thinking tokens (e.g., replacing
"</think>" with "Wait") can extend reasoning steps and improve accuracy. In
this work, we explore whether a dedicated continue-thinking token can be
learned to trigger extended reasoning. We augment a distilled version of
DeepSeek-R1 with a single learned "<|continue-thinking|>" token, training only
its embedding via reinforcement learning while keeping the model weights
frozen. Our experiments show that this learned token achieves improved accuracy
on standard math benchmarks compared to both the baseline model and a test-time
scaling approach that uses a fixed token (e.g., "Wait") for budget forcing. In
particular, we observe that in cases where the fixed-token approach enhances
the base model's accuracy, our method achieves a markedly greater improvement.
For example, on the GSM8K benchmark, the fixed-token approach yields a 1.3%
absolute improvement in accuracy, whereas our learned-token method achieves a
4.2% improvement over the base model that does not use budget forcing.

Motivation: 课程学习在机器学习领域已显示出潜力，但在预训练语言模型中的应用尚未充分探索，因此作者进行了系统性研究。

Method: 实验了多种课程学习设置，包括基础课程学习、基于步调的采样和交错课程，并基于六种难度指标（语言学和信息论视角）进行指导。

Result: 课程学习在早期和中期训练阶段显著提升收敛速度，作为预热策略时可带来3.5%的性能提升。压缩比、词汇多样性和可读性被证明是有效的难度信号。

Conclusion: 研究强调了数据排序在大规模预训练中的重要性，并为实际训练场景下的高效模型开发提供了实用建议。

Abstract: Curriculum learning has shown promise in improving training efficiency and
generalization in various machine learning domains, yet its potential in
pretraining language models remains underexplored, prompting our work as the
first systematic investigation in this area. We experimented with different
settings, including vanilla curriculum learning, pacing-based sampling, and
interleaved curricula-guided by six difficulty metrics spanning linguistic and
information-theoretic perspectives. We train models under these settings and
evaluate their performance on eight diverse benchmarks. Our experiments reveal
that curriculum learning consistently improves convergence in early and
mid-training phases, and can yield lasting gains when used as a warmup strategy
with up to $3.5\%$ improvement. Notably, we identify compression ratio, lexical
diversity, and readability as effective difficulty signals across settings. Our
findings highlight the importance of data ordering in large-scale pretraining
and provide actionable insights for scalable, data-efficient model development
under realistic training scenarios.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Avey的新神经网络架构，旨在解决Transformer在处理长序列时的局限性，同时避免RNN的并行性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer在处理长序列时存在固定上下文窗口和二次复杂度的问题，而RNN虽然能线性扩展序列长度，但并行性受限。因此，需要一种新的架构来兼顾效率和长序列处理能力。

Method: Avey由排序器和自回归神经处理器组成，能够动态识别和上下文化最相关的标记，且解耦了序列长度和上下文宽度。

Result: 实验表明，Avey在短范围NLP任务上与Transformer表现相当，且在长范围依赖处理上表现更优。

Conclusion: Avey是一种突破性的架构，能够有效处理任意长序列，同时保持高效性。

Abstract: The Transformer has become the de facto standard for large language models
and a wide range of downstream tasks across various domains. Despite its
numerous advantages like inherent training parallelism, the Transformer still
faces key challenges due to its inability to effectively process sequences
beyond a fixed context window and the quadratic complexity of its attention
mechanism. These challenges have renewed interest in RNN-like architectures,
which offer linear scaling with sequence length and improved handling of
long-range dependencies, albeit with limited parallelism due to their
inherently recurrent nature. In this paper, we propose Avey, a new neural
foundational architecture that breaks away from both attention and recurrence.
Avey comprises a ranker and an autoregressive neural processor, which
collaboratively identify and contextualize only the most relevant tokens for
any given token, regardless of their positions in the sequence. Specifically,
Avey decouples sequence length from context width, thus enabling effective
processing of arbitrarily long sequences. Experimental results show that Avey
compares favorably to the Transformer across a variety of standard short-range
NLP benchmarks, while notably excelling at capturing long-range dependencies.

Conclusion: Transformer模型的困惑度与其对人类语言处理的预测能力呈正相关，且适用于多种测量方式。

Abstract: As Transformers become more widely incorporated into natural language
processing tasks, there has been considerable interest in using surprisal from
these models as predictors of human sentence processing difficulty. Recent work
has observed a positive relationship between Transformer-based models'
perplexity and the predictive power of their surprisal estimates on reading
times, showing that language models with more parameters and trained on more
data are less predictive of human reading times. However, these studies focus
on predicting latency-based measures (i.e., self-paced reading times and
eye-gaze durations) with surprisal estimates from Transformer-based language
models. This trend has not been tested on brain imaging data. This study
therefore evaluates the predictive power of surprisal estimates from 17
pre-trained Transformer-based models across three different language families
on two functional magnetic resonance imaging datasets. Results show that the
positive relationship between model perplexity and model fit still obtains,
suggesting that this trend is not specific to latency-based measures and can be
generalized to neural measures.

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) offers unprecedented opportunities
to reimagine peer review beyond the constraints of traditional workflows.
Despite these opportunities, prior efforts have largely focused on replicating
traditional review workflows with LLMs serving as direct substitutes for human
reviewers, while limited attention has been given to exploring new paradigms
that fundamentally rethink how LLMs can participate in the academic review
process. In this paper, we introduce and explore a novel mechanism that employs
LLM agents to perform pairwise comparisons among manuscripts instead of
individual scoring. By aggregating outcomes from substantial pairwise
evaluations, this approach enables a more accurate and robust measure of
relative manuscript quality. Our experiments demonstrate that this comparative
approach significantly outperforms traditional rating-based methods in
identifying high-impact papers. However, our analysis also reveals emergent
biases in the selection process, notably a reduced novelty in research topics
and an increased institutional imbalance. These findings highlight both the
transformative potential of rethinking peer review with LLMs and critical
challenges that future systems must address to ensure equity and diversity.

Conclusion: 本文展示了利用语言特征进行说话人分割的潜力，并强调语义理解的重要性，为多模态和语义特征分割研究开辟了新方向。

Abstract: We present a novel approach to Speaker Diarization (SD) by leveraging
text-based methods focused on Sentence-level Speaker Change Detection within
dialogues. Unlike audio-based SD systems, which are often challenged by audio
quality and speaker similarity, our approach utilizes the dialogue transcript
alone. Two models are developed: the Single Prediction Model (SPM) and the
Multiple Prediction Model (MPM), both of which demonstrate significant
improvements in identifying speaker changes, particularly in short
conversations. Our findings, based on a curated dataset encompassing diverse
conversational scenarios, reveal that the text-based SD approach, especially
the MPM, performs competitively against state-of-the-art audio-based SD
systems, with superior performance in short conversational contexts. This paper
not only showcases the potential of leveraging linguistic features for SD but
also highlights the importance of integrating semantic understanding into SD
systems, opening avenues for future research in multimodal and semantic
feature-based diarization.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have become ubiquitous in many fields,
understanding and mitigating LLM biases is an ongoing issue. This paper
provides a novel method for evaluating the demographic biases of various
generative AI models. By prompting models to assess a moral patient's
willingness to intervene constructively, we aim to quantitatively evaluate
different LLMs' biases towards various genders, races, and ages. Our work
differs from existing work by aiming to determine the baseline demographic
identities for various commercial models and the relationship between the
baseline and other demographics. We strive to understand if these biases are
positive, neutral, or negative, and the strength of these biases. This paper
can contribute to the objective assessment of bias in Large Language Models and
give the user or developer the power to account for these biases in LLM output
or in training future LLMs. Our analysis suggested two key findings: that
models view the baseline demographic as a white middle-aged or young adult
male; however, a general trend across models suggested that non-baseline
demographics are more willing to help than the baseline. These methodologies
allowed us to distinguish these two biases that are often tangled together.

Motivation: 受人类认知发展的启发，研究如何通过逐步增加模型深度和数据难度来提高预训练效率。

Method: 提出Curriculum-Guided Layer Scaling (CGLS)，通过渐进式层堆叠和数据难度分级（如从简单故事到专业内容）同步训练模型。

Result: 在100M和1.2B参数规模下，CGLS在PIQA、ARC等基准测试中表现优异，显示出更好的泛化和零样本性能。

Conclusion: CGLS是一种简单有效的策略，能够提升知识密集型和推理任务的泛化能力。

Abstract: As the cost of pretraining large language models grows, there is continued
interest in strategies to improve learning efficiency during this core training
stage. Motivated by cognitive development, where humans gradually build
knowledge as their brains mature, we propose Curriculum-Guided Layer Scaling
(CGLS), a framework for compute-efficient pretraining that synchronizes
increasing data difficulty with model growth through progressive layer stacking
(i.e. gradually adding layers during training). At the 100M parameter scale,
using a curriculum transitioning from synthetic short stories to general web
data, CGLS outperforms baseline methods on the question-answering benchmarks
PIQA and ARC. Pretraining at the 1.2B scale, we stratify the DataComp-LM corpus
with a DistilBERT-based classifier and progress from general text to highly
technical or specialized content. Our results show that progressively
increasing model depth alongside sample difficulty leads to better
generalization and zero-shot performance on various downstream benchmarks.
Altogether, our findings demonstrate that CGLS unlocks the potential of
progressive stacking, offering a simple yet effective strategy for improving
generalization on knowledge-intensive and reasoning tasks.

Motivation: 长上下文LLMs的KV缓存需求大，现有方法或丢弃关键信息或效率低，需高效解决方案。

Method: 将序列分块，提出分块软匹配策略，通过相似性聚类并合并KV缓存为单一质心。

Result: 实验显示Chelsea减少80% KV缓存内存，解码速度提升3.19倍，端到端延迟降低2.72倍。

Conclusion: Chelsea高效解决了长上下文LLMs的KV缓存问题，显著提升性能和效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with extended context windows have become
increasingly prevalent for tackling complex tasks. However, the substantial
Key-Value (KV) cache required for long-context LLMs poses significant
deployment challenges. Existing approaches either discard potentially critical
information needed for future generations or offer limited efficiency gains due
to high computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce Chelsea, a simple
yet effective framework for online KV cache clustering. Our approach is based
on the observation that key states exhibit high similarity along the sequence
dimension. To enable efficient clustering, we divide the sequence into chunks
and propose Chunked Soft Matching, which employs an alternating partition
strategy within each chunk and identifies clusters based on similarity. Chelsea
then merges the KV cache within each cluster into a single centroid.
Additionally, we provide a theoretical analysis of the computational complexity
and the optimality of the intra-chunk partitioning strategy. Extensive
experiments across various models and long-context benchmarks demonstrate that
Chelsea achieves up to 80% reduction in KV cache memory usage while maintaining
comparable model performance. Moreover, with minimal computational overhead,
Chelsea accelerates the decoding stage of inference by up to 3.19$\times$ and
reduces end-to-end latency by up to 2.72$\times$.

TL;DR: Agent-RLVR通过引入代理指导机制，改进了传统RLVR在复杂代理环境中的表现，显著提升了模型在软件工程任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RLVR在多步复杂问题解决环境中效果不佳，因为奖励信号稀疏，难以有效训练模型。

Method: Agent-RLVR结合代理指导机制，利用多样信息提示（如战略计划和动态反馈）引导代理完成任务，并通过RLVR更新策略。

Result: 在SWE-Bench Verified任务中，Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct的pass@1性能从9.4%提升至22.4%，进一步优化后达到27.8%。

Conclusion: Agent-RLVR为复杂现实环境中使用RLVR训练代理奠定了基础。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has been widely adopted
as the de facto method for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large
language models and has demonstrated notable success in verifiable domains like
math and competitive programming tasks. However, the efficacy of RLVR
diminishes significantly when applied to agentic environments. These settings,
characterized by multi-step, complex problem solving, lead to high failure
rates even for frontier LLMs, as the reward landscape is too sparse for
effective model training via conventional RLVR. In this work, we introduce
Agent-RLVR, a framework that makes RLVR effective in challenging agentic
settings, with an initial focus on software engineering tasks. Inspired by
human pedagogy, Agent-RLVR introduces agent guidance, a mechanism that actively
steers the agent towards successful trajectories by leveraging diverse
informational cues. These cues, ranging from high-level strategic plans to
dynamic feedback on the agent's errors and environmental interactions, emulate
a teacher's guidance, enabling the agent to navigate difficult solution spaces
and promotes active self-improvement via additional environment exploration. In
the Agent-RLVR training loop, agents first attempt to solve tasks to produce
initial trajectories, which are then validated by unit tests and supplemented
with agent guidance. Agents then reattempt with guidance, and the agent policy
is updated with RLVR based on the rewards of these guided trajectories.
Agent-RLVR elevates the pass@1 performance of Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct from 9.4%
to 22.4% on SWE-Bench Verified. We find that our guidance-augmented RLVR data
is additionally useful for test-time reward model training, shown by further
boosting pass@1 to 27.8%. Agent-RLVR lays the groundwork for training agents
with RLVR in complex, real-world environments where conventional RL methods
struggle.

Motivation: 解决韩语语法纠错任务中大型通用语言模型（如GPT-4）在特定错误类型（如标点符号）上表现不足的问题。

Method: 微调NLLB模型，使用特殊语言标记区分原始和纠正句子，并通过BLEU评分和LLM作为评判方法评估。

Result: KoGEC在韩语GEC任务中表现优于GPT-4和HCX-3，尤其在标点错误上更均衡。

Conclusion: 研究表明，针对特定任务的紧凑模型在专业NLP任务中可以与大型通用模型竞争，并提供了新的评估方法。

Abstract: This research introduces KoGEC, a Korean Grammatical Error Correction system
using pre\--trained translation models. We fine-tuned NLLB (No Language Left
Behind) models for Korean GEC, comparing their performance against large
language models like GPT-4 and HCX-3. The study used two social media
conversation datasets for training and testing. The NLLB models were fine-tuned
using special language tokens to distinguish between original and corrected
Korean sentences. Evaluation was done using BLEU scores and an "LLM as judge"
method to classify error types. Results showed that the fine-tuned NLLB (KoGEC)
models outperformed GPT-4o and HCX-3 in Korean GEC tasks. KoGEC demonstrated a
more balanced error correction profile across various error types, whereas the
larger LLMs tended to focus less on punctuation errors. We also developed a
Chrome extension to make the KoGEC system accessible to users. Finally, we
explored token vocabulary expansion to further improve the model but found it
to decrease model performance. This research contributes to the field of NLP by
providing an efficient, specialized Korean GEC system and a new evaluation
method. It also highlights the potential of compact, task-specific models to
compete with larger, general-purpose language models in specialized NLP tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在长文本中定位特定信息（如NIAH测试）表现出色，但它们在检测明显缺失信息时表现较差，因此需要评估和改进这一能力。

Method: 通过AbsenceBench测试LLM在三个领域（数字序列、诗歌、GitHub拉取请求）中检测缺失信息的能力，比较原始和编辑后的文本。

Result: 实验显示，即使先进模型如Claude-3.7-Sonnet在5K上下文的平均长度下，F1得分仅为69.6%，表现不佳。

Conclusion: Transformer注意力机制难以处理文本中的“空缺”，因为缺失信息无法对应具体的注意力键，导致模型在此类任务中表现不佳。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly capable of processing long
inputs and locating specific information within them, as evidenced by their
performance on the Needle in a Haystack (NIAH) test. However, while models
excel at recalling surprising information, they still struggle to identify
clearly omitted information. We introduce AbsenceBench to assesses LLMs'
capacity to detect missing information across three domains: numerical
sequences, poetry, and GitHub pull requests. AbsenceBench asks models to
identify which pieces of a document were deliberately removed, given access to
both the original and edited contexts. Despite the apparent straightforwardness
of these tasks, our experiments reveal that even state-of-the-art models like
Claude-3.7-Sonnet achieve only 69.6% F1-score with a modest average context
length of 5K tokens. Our analysis suggests this poor performance stems from a
fundamental limitation: Transformer attention mechanisms cannot easily attend
to "gaps" in documents since these absences don't correspond to any specific
keys that can be attended to. Overall, our results and analysis provide a case
study of the close proximity of tasks where models are already superhuman
(NIAH) and tasks where models breakdown unexpectedly (AbsenceBench).

Abstract: Human evaluators provide necessary contributions in evaluating large language
models. In the context of Machine Translation (MT) systems for low-resource
languages (LRLs), this is made even more apparent since popular automated
metrics tend to be string-based, and therefore do not provide a full picture of
the nuances of the behavior of the system. Human evaluators, when equipped with
the necessary expertise of the language, will be able to test for adequacy,
fluency, and other important metrics. However, the low resource nature of the
language means that both datasets and evaluators are in short supply. This
presents the following conundrum: How can developers of MT systems for these
LRLs find adequate human evaluators and datasets? This paper first presents a
comprehensive review of existing evaluation procedures, with the objective of
producing a design proposal for a platform that addresses the resource gap in
terms of datasets and evaluators in developing MT systems. The result is a
design for a recruitment and gamified evaluation platform for developers of MT
systems. Challenges are also discussed in terms of evaluating this platform, as
well as its possible applications in the wider scope of Natural Language
Processing (NLP) research.

Abstract: Large language models have shown promise in clinical decision making, but
current approaches struggle to localize and correct errors at specific steps of
the reasoning process. This limitation is critical in medicine, where
identifying and addressing reasoning errors is essential for accurate diagnosis
and effective patient care. We introduce Med-PRM, a process reward modeling
framework that leverages retrieval-augmented generation to verify each
reasoning step against established medical knowledge bases. By verifying
intermediate reasoning steps with evidence retrieved from clinical guidelines
and literature, our model can precisely assess the reasoning quality in a
fine-grained manner. Evaluations on five medical QA benchmarks and two
open-ended diagnostic tasks demonstrate that Med-PRM achieves state-of-the-art
performance, with improving the performance of base models by up to 13.50%
using Med-PRM. Moreover, we demonstrate the generality of Med-PRM by
integrating it in a plug-and-play fashion with strong policy models such as
Meerkat, achieving over 80\% accuracy on MedQA for the first time using
small-scale models of 8 billion parameters. Our code and data are available at:

Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型（如BERT）在语义任务中的表现是否反映真正的概念能力，而非表面统计关联。

Method: 通过分析BERT内部表示，比较概念对在分类任务中的表现与[CLS]标记嵌入的结构。

Result: 预训练BERT能实现高分类准确率，但关系类型仅在监督微调后在高维嵌入空间中显现。

Conclusion: 行为表现不必然反映结构化概念理解，但模型可通过适当训练获得关系抽象的归纳偏置。

Abstract: While large language models like BERT demonstrate strong empirical
performance on semantic tasks, whether this reflects true conceptual competence
or surface-level statistical association remains unclear. I investigate whether
BERT encodes abstract relational schemata by examining internal representations
of concept pairs across taxonomic, mereological, and functional relations. I
compare BERT's relational classification performance with representational
structure in [CLS] token embeddings. Results reveal that pretrained BERT
enables high classification accuracy, indicating latent relational signals.
However, concept pairs organize by relation type in high-dimensional embedding
space only after fine-tuning on supervised relation classification tasks. This
indicates relational schemata are not emergent from pretraining alone but can
be induced via task scaffolding. These findings demonstrate that behavioral
performance does not necessarily imply structured conceptual understanding,
though models can acquire inductive biases for grounded relational abstraction
through appropriate training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在处理长上下文输入时面临计算和内存的高昂成本，现有压缩技术常导致性能下降。

Method: 采用LRSA方法，结合LagKV压缩技术，通过分块预填充选择最相关的键值对，聚焦于关键历史上下文。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了LLM在键值压缩下的鲁棒性，并在问答任务中取得了更好的微调效果。

Conclusion: LRSA方法在减少计算和内存开销的同时，有效提升了模型处理长上下文的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in natural
language processing and generation, yet their ability to handle long-context
input remains constrained by the quadratic complexity of attention computation
and linear-increasing key-value memory footprint. To reduce computational costs
and memory, key-value cache compression techniques are commonly applied at
inference time, but this often leads to severe performance degradation, as
models are not trained to handle compressed context. Although there are more
sophisticated compression methods, they are typically unsuitable for
post-training because of their incompatibility with gradient-based optimization
or high computation overhead. To fill this gap with no additional parameter and
little computation overhead, we propose Lag-Relative Sparse Attention(LRSA)
anchored by the LagKV compression method for long context post-training. Our
method performs chunk-by-chunk prefilling, which selects the top K most
relevant key-value pairs in a fixed-size lagging window, allowing the model to
focus on salient historical context while maintaining efficiency. Experimental
results show that our approach significantly enhances the robustness of the LLM
with key-value compression and achieves better fine-tuned results in the
question-answer tuning task.

Abstract: Multimodal chatbots have become one of the major topics for dialogue systems
in both research community and industry. Recently, researchers have shed light
on the multimodality of responses as well as dialogue contexts. This work
explores how a dialogue system can output responses in various modalities such
as text and image. To this end, we first formulate a multimodal dialogue
response retrieval task for retrieval-based systems as the combination of three
subtasks. We then propose three integration methods based on a two-step
approach and an end-to-end approach, and compare the merits and demerits of
each method. Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate that the
end-to-end approach achieves comparable performance without an intermediate
step in the two-step approach. In addition, a parameter sharing strategy not
only reduces the number of parameters but also boosts performance by
transferring knowledge across the subtasks and the modalities.

TL;DR: 论文提出MUDI方法，通过多话语关系图学习提升个性化对话生成的自然性和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个性化对话生成需保持连贯性并与用户个人特征一致，现有方法面临挑战。

Method: 利用大语言模型标注话语关系并构建结构化对话图，采用DialogueGAT编码器捕捉隐含关系，结合一致性感知注意力策略生成响应。

Result: 实验显示个性化响应质量显著提升，更接近人类对话。

Conclusion: MUDI方法有效提升个性化对话生成的自然性和一致性。

Abstract: In dialogue generation, the naturalness of responses is crucial for effective
human-machine interaction. Personalized response generation poses even greater
challenges, as the responses must remain coherent and consistent with the
user's personal traits or persona descriptions. We propose MUDI
($\textbf{Mu}$ltiple $\textbf{Di}$scourse Relations Graph Learning) for
personalized dialogue generation. We utilize a Large Language Model to assist
in annotating discourse relations and to transform dialogue data into
structured dialogue graphs. Our graph encoder, the proposed DialogueGAT model,
then captures implicit discourse relations within this structure, along with
persona descriptions. During the personalized response generation phase, novel
coherence-aware attention strategies are implemented to enhance the decoder's
consideration of discourse relations. Our experiments demonstrate significant
improvements in the quality of personalized responses, thus resembling
human-like dialogue exchanges.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在多语言文本加标音符号任务中的有效性，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 引入多语言数据集MultiDiac，评估14种LLMs和6种专用模型，并对4种小模型进行LoRA微调。

Result: 现成LLMs在阿拉伯语和约鲁巴语中表现优于专用模型，但小模型易产生幻觉；微调可提升性能。

Conclusion: LLMs在文本加标音符号任务中具有潜力，微调小模型可减少幻觉并提升效果。

Abstract: We investigate the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) for text
diacritization in two typologically distinct languages: Arabic and Yoruba. To
enable a rigorous evaluation, we introduce a novel multilingual dataset
MultiDiac, with diverse samples that capture a range of diacritic ambiguities.
We evaluate 14 LLMs varying in size, accessibility, and language coverage, and
benchmark them against 6 specialized diacritization models. Additionally, we
fine-tune four small open-source models using LoRA for Yoruba. Our results show
that many off-the-shelf LLMs outperform specialized diacritization models for
both Arabic and Yoruba, but smaller models suffer from hallucinations.
Fine-tuning on a small dataset can help improve diacritization performance and
reduce hallucination rates.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨场景上下文如何影响人类对同一物体的不同概念化和命名方式，以及多模态LLM是否能捕捉这种多样性。

Method: 构建SceneGram数据集，包含不同场景上下文中的tangram形状的人类参考，并分析多模态LLM的参考生成。

Result: 多模态LLM未能捕捉人类概念化的丰富性和变异性。

Conclusion: 场景上下文显著影响人类概念化，而多模态LLM在此方面表现不足。

Abstract: Research on reference and naming suggests that humans can come up with very
different ways of conceptualizing and referring to the same object, e.g. the
same abstract tangram shape can be a "crab", "sink" or "space ship". Another
common assumption in cognitive science is that scene context fundamentally
shapes our visual perception of objects and conceptual expectations. This paper
contributes SceneGram, a dataset of human references to tangram shapes placed
in different scene contexts, allowing for systematic analyses of the effect of
scene context on conceptualization. Based on this data, we analyze references
to tangram shapes generated by multimodal LLMs, showing that these models do
not account for the richness and variability of conceptualizations found in
human references.

Conclusion: LoRA-Gen实现了高效的知识迁移和推理加速，适用于边缘端模型特化。

Abstract: Recent advances have highlighted the benefits of scaling language models to
enhance performance across a wide range of NLP tasks. However, these approaches
still face limitations in effectiveness and efficiency when applied to
domain-specific tasks, particularly for small edge-side models. We propose the
LoRA-Gen framework, which utilizes a large cloud-side model to generate LoRA
parameters for edge-side models based on task descriptions. By employing the
reparameterization technique, we merge the LoRA parameters into the edge-side
model to achieve flexible specialization. Our method facilitates knowledge
transfer between models while significantly improving the inference efficiency
of the specialized model by reducing the input context length. Without
specialized training, LoRA-Gen outperforms conventional LoRA fine-tuning, which
achieves competitive accuracy and a 2.1x speedup with TinyLLaMA-1.1B in
reasoning tasks. Besides, our method delivers a compression ratio of 10.1x with
Gemma-2B on intelligent agent tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公开可用的高质量CRF数据集稀缺，限制了基于临床笔记的CRF填充系统的发展。

Method: 提出半自动转换方法，将信息提取任务数据集转化为结构化CRF，并以E3C数据集为例进行应用。

Result: 生成的CRF填充数据集在零-shot LLM上表现分别为意大利语59.7%和英语67.3%，开源模型表现更差。

Conclusion: 填充CRF对现有LLM仍具挑战性，研究者发布了数据集以促进相关研究。

Abstract: Case Report Forms (CRFs) are largely used in medical research as they ensure
accuracy, reliability, and validity of results in clinical studies. However,
publicly available, wellannotated CRF datasets are scarce, limiting the
development of CRF slot filling systems able to fill in a CRF from clinical
notes. To mitigate the scarcity of CRF datasets, we propose to take advantage
of available datasets annotated for information extraction tasks and to convert
them into structured CRFs. We present a semi-automatic conversion methodology,
which has been applied to the E3C dataset in two languages (English and
Italian), resulting in a new, high-quality dataset for CRF slot filling.
Through several experiments on the created dataset, we report that slot filling
achieves 59.7% for Italian and 67.3% for English on a closed Large Language
Models (zero-shot) and worse performances on three families of open-source
models, showing that filling CRFs is challenging even for recent
state-of-the-art LLMs. We release the datest at

TL;DR: Amnesic probing用于分析模型行为中特定语言信息的影响，通过移除目标信息观察性能变化。INLP方法存在随机修改问题，而MP和LEACE能更精准移除信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何更精准地移除目标信息以评估其对模型行为的影响。

Method: 提出MP和LEACE作为INLP的替代方法，用于更精准地移除信息。

Result: MP和LEACE比INLP更有效地移除目标信息，减少随机修改。

Conclusion: MP和LEACE提升了Amnesic Probing的准确性，有助于更好地解释模型行为。

Abstract: Amnesic probing is a technique used to examine the influence of specific
linguistic information on the behaviour of a model. This involves identifying
and removing the relevant information and then assessing whether the model's
performance on the main task changes. If the removed information is relevant,
the model's performance should decline. The difficulty with this approach lies
in removing only the target information while leaving other information
unchanged. It has been shown that Iterative Nullspace Projection (INLP), a
widely used removal technique, introduces random modifications to
representations when eliminating target information. We demonstrate that Mean
Projection (MP) and LEACE, two proposed alternatives, remove information in a
more targeted manner, thereby enhancing the potential for obtaining behavioural
explanations through Amnesic Probing.

TL;DR: 论文提出Configurable Preference Tuning (CPT)框架，通过动态调整语言模型行为以适应多样化的用户偏好，解决了传统方法偏好单一的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI对齐方法假设用户偏好是静态且单一的，限制了模型的适应性和灵活性。CPT旨在通过动态调整模型行为来解决这一问题。

Method: CPT利用基于结构化评分标准生成的合成偏好数据，通过微调语言模型，使其能够根据系统提示动态调整输出，而无需重新训练。

Result: 实验表明，CPT能够实现细粒度控制，并更准确地模拟复杂和上下文相关的人类反馈。相关代码、数据集和模型已开源。

Conclusion: CPT为语言模型提供了动态适应多样化偏好的能力，显著提升了模型的灵活性和实用性。

Abstract: Models of human feedback for AI alignment, such as those underpinning Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), often bake in a singular, static set of
preferences, limiting adaptability. This paper challenges the assumption of
monolithic preferences by introducing Configurable Preference Tuning (CPT), a
novel framework for endowing language models with the ability to dynamically
adjust their behavior based on explicit, human-interpretable directives. CPT
leverages synthetically generated preference data, conditioned on system
prompts derived from structured, fine-grained rubrics that define desired
attributes like writing style. By fine-tuning with these rubric-guided
preferences, the LLM learns to modulate its outputs at inference time in
response to the system prompt, without retraining. This approach not only
offers fine-grained control but also provides a mechanism for modeling more
nuanced and context-dependent human feedback. Several experimental artifacts,
such as training code, generated datasets and fine-tuned models are released at

TL;DR: 论文探讨了深度学习（DL）中从传统FP64计算转向低精度格式（如FP16、BF16、8/16位整数）的趋势，并提出适应混合精度整数（MIP）算术的gemm优化策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着硬件架构向混合精度点积操作优化，传统gemm方法逐渐过时，需要新的优化策略以适应现代ISA（如x86_64、ARM、RISC-V）。

Method: 提出新颖的微内核设计和数据布局，以更好地利用现代专用硬件，并比较MIP算术与浮点实现的性能。

Result: 在三种代表性CPU架构上，MIP算术相比浮点实现展示了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: 论文标志着gemm优化的新时代，适应DL推理需求，称为矩阵乘法的“寒武纪时期”。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning (DL) have led to a shift from traditional
64-bit floating point (FP64) computations toward reduced-precision formats,
such as FP16, BF16, and 8- or 16-bit integers, combined with mixed-precision
arithmetic. This transition enhances computational throughput, reduces memory
and bandwidth usage, and improves energy efficiency, offering significant
advantages for resource-constrained edge devices. To support this shift,
hardware architectures have evolved accordingly, now including adapted ISAs
(Instruction Set Architectures) that expose mixed-precision vector units and
matrix engines tailored for DL workloads. At the heart of many DL and
scientific computing tasks is the general matrix-matrix multiplication gemm, a
fundamental kernel historically optimized using axpy vector instructions on
SIMD (single instruction, multiple data) units. However, as hardware moves
toward mixed-precision dot-product-centric operations optimized for quantized
inference, these legacy approaches are being phased out. In response to this,
our paper revisits traditional high-performance gemm and describes strategies
for adapting it to mixed-precision integer (MIP) arithmetic across modern ISAs,
including x86_64, ARM, and RISC-V. Concretely, we illustrate novel micro-kernel
designs and data layouts that better exploit today's specialized hardware and
demonstrate significant performance gains from MIP arithmetic over
floating-point implementations across three representative CPU architectures.
These contributions highlight a new era of gemm optimization-driven by the
demands of DL inference on heterogeneous architectures, marking what we term as
the "Cambrian period" for matrix multiplication.

TL;DR: DART提出了一种自蒸馏框架，用非自回归的Silent Thought（ST）替代自回归的Chain-of-Thought（CoT），以提高推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归的CoT推理在计算上开销较大，限制了其在延迟敏感应用中的部署。

Method: DART通过两个训练路径（CoT路径和ST路径）和一个轻量级的Reasoning Evolvement Module（REM）实现推理效率的提升。

Result: 实验表明，DART在保持推理性能的同时显著提高了效率。

Conclusion: DART是一种高效推理的可行替代方案。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has significantly advanced Large Language
Models (LLMs) in solving complex tasks. However, its autoregressive paradigm
leads to significant computational overhead, hindering its deployment in
latency-sensitive applications. To address this, we propose \textbf{DART}
(\textbf{D}istilling \textbf{A}utoregressive \textbf{R}easoning to Silent
\textbf{T}hought), a self-distillation framework that enables LLMs to replace
autoregressive CoT with non-autoregressive Silent Thought (ST). Specifically,
DART introduces two training pathways: the CoT pathway for traditional
reasoning and the ST pathway for generating answers directly from a few ST
tokens. The ST pathway utilizes a lightweight Reasoning Evolvement Module (REM)
to align its hidden states with the CoT pathway, enabling the ST tokens to
evolve into informative embeddings. During inference, only the ST pathway is
activated, leveraging evolving ST tokens to deliver the answer directly.
Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DART achieves comparable
reasoning performance to existing baselines while offering significant
efficiency gains, serving as a feasible alternative for efficient reasoning.

Motivation: 目前缺乏系统性评估深度研究代理能力的基准，因此开发了DeepResearch Bench以填补这一空白。

Method: 提出了两种评估方法：一种是基于参考的自适应标准评估报告质量，另一种是评估信息检索和引用的准确性。

Result: DeepResearch Bench开源，以加速基于LLM的代理开发。

Conclusion: 该基准和方法为评估和推动深度研究代理的发展提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Deep Research Agents are a prominent category of LLM-based agents. By
autonomously orchestrating multistep web exploration, targeted retrieval, and
higher-order synthesis, they transform vast amounts of online information into
analyst-grade, citation-rich reports--compressing hours of manual desk research
into minutes. However, a comprehensive benchmark for systematically evaluating
the capabilities of these agents remains absent. To bridge this gap, we present
DeepResearch Bench, a benchmark consisting of 100 PhD-level research tasks,
each meticulously crafted by domain experts across 22 distinct fields.
Evaluating DRAs is inherently complex and labor-intensive. We therefore propose
two novel methodologies that achieve strong alignment with human judgment. The
first is a reference-based method with adaptive criteria to assess the quality
of generated research reports. The other framework is introduced to evaluate
DRA's information retrieval and collection capabilities by assessing its
effective citation count and overall citation accuracy. We have open-sourced
DeepResearch Bench and key components of these frameworks at
https://github.com/Ayanami0730/deep_research_bench to accelerate the
development of practical LLM-based agents.

Motivation: 大语言模型在长上下文建模中受限于固定上下文窗口，长度泛化能力不足，传统方法多关注输入特征，本文转向输出分布视角。

Result: 实验表明长短期对齐与长度泛化性能强相关，提出的正则化方法显著提升模型表现。

Conclusion: 输出分布的长短期对齐是提升长度泛化的关键，新方法为长上下文建模提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive performance and
surprising emergent properties. However, their effectiveness remains limited by
the fixed context window of the transformer architecture, posing challenges for
long-context modeling. Among these challenges, length generalization -- the
ability to generalize to sequences longer than those seen during training -- is
a classical and fundamental problem. In this work, we propose a fresh
perspective on length generalization, shifting the focus from the conventional
emphasis on input features such as positional encodings or data structures to
the output distribution of the model. Specifically, through case studies on
synthetic tasks, we highlight the critical role of \textbf{long-short
alignment} -- the consistency of output distributions across sequences of
varying lengths. Extending this insight to natural language tasks, we propose a
metric called Long-Short Misalignment to quantify this phenomenon, uncovering a
strong correlation between the metric and length generalization performance.
Building on these findings, we develop a regularization term that promotes
long-short alignment during training. Extensive experiments validate the
effectiveness of our approach, offering new insights for achieving more
effective long-context modeling in LLMs. Code is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）通常表现出左倾偏见，而角色提示可以调整其行为以匹配不同社会经济群体。本研究旨在验证零样本角色提示是否能准确预测个体投票决策及群体政策立场。

Method: 通过零样本角色提示和有限信息，预测欧洲议员的投票行为，并评估其对反事实论点、不同角色提示和生成方法的稳定性。

Result: 研究发现，该方法能较准确地模拟欧洲议员的投票行为（加权F1分数约0.793）。

Conclusion: 零样本角色提示可用于预测欧洲议员的投票行为，且效果稳定。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) display remarkable capabilities to understand or
even produce political discourse, but have been found to consistently display a
progressive left-leaning bias. At the same time, so-called persona or identity
prompts have been shown to produce LLM behavior that aligns with socioeconomic
groups that the base model is not aligned with. In this work, we analyze
whether zero-shot persona prompting with limited information can accurately
predict individual voting decisions and, by aggregation, accurately predict
positions of European groups on a diverse set of policies. We evaluate if
predictions are stable towards counterfactual arguments, different persona
prompts and generation methods. Finally, we find that we can simulate voting
behavior of Members of the European Parliament reasonably well with a weighted
F1 score of approximately 0.793. Our persona dataset of politicians in the 2024
European Parliament and our code are available at

Abstract: We investigate the linguistic abilities of multimodal large language models

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为PPA的两阶段框架，用于解决多轮对话中保持长期一致性和生成多样化个性化回复的挑战。PPA先基于对话上下文生成通用回复，再通过回复检索相关人物记忆并调整回复以符合人物特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在生成回复前检索人物信息，限制了多样性和导致通用输出。PPA旨在通过后处理对齐策略提升自然性和多样性，同时保持一致性。

Method: PPA采用两阶段框架：1）基于对话上下文生成通用回复；2）以回复为查询检索人物记忆并调整回复以对齐人物特征。

Result: 实验表明，PPA在多轮对话数据上显著优于现有方法，在一致性、多样性和人物相关性方面表现更优。

Conclusion: PPA为长期个性化对话生成提供了更灵活有效的范式。

Abstract: Multi-session persona-based dialogue generation presents challenges in
maintaining long-term consistency and generating diverse, personalized
responses. While large language models (LLMs) excel in single-session
dialogues, they struggle to preserve persona fidelity and conversational
coherence across extended interactions. Existing methods typically retrieve
persona information before response generation, which can constrain diversity
and result in generic outputs. We propose Post Persona Alignment (PPA), a novel
two-stage framework that reverses this process. PPA first generates a general
response based solely on dialogue context, then retrieves relevant persona
memories using the response as a query, and finally refines the response to
align with the speaker's persona. This post-hoc alignment strategy promotes
naturalness and diversity while preserving consistency and personalization.
Experiments on multi-session LLM-generated dialogue data demonstrate that PPA
significantly outperforms prior approaches in consistency, diversity, and
persona relevance, offering a more flexible and effective paradigm for
long-term personalized dialogue generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在处理长上下文时，KV缓存的内存需求增加，现有压缩方法牺牲准确性或引入计算开销。

Method: 提出FourierAttention框架，利用Transformer头维度的异质性，通过傅里叶基投影和频谱系数近似长上下文不敏感维度。

Result: 在LLaMA模型上，FourierAttention在LongBench和NIAH任务中实现了最佳长上下文准确性。

Conclusion: FourierAttention通过优化内存和计算效率，为长上下文处理提供了高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models struggle with memory demands from the growing Key-Value
(KV) cache as context lengths increase. Existing compression methods homogenize
head dimensions or rely on attention-guided token pruning, often sacrificing
accuracy or introducing computational overhead. We propose FourierAttention, a
training-free framework that exploits the heterogeneous roles of transformer
head dimensions: lower dimensions prioritize local context, while upper ones
capture long-range dependencies. By projecting the long-context-insensitive
dimensions onto orthogonal Fourier bases, FourierAttention approximates their
temporal evolution with fixed-length spectral coefficients. Evaluations on
LLaMA models show that FourierAttention achieves the best long-context accuracy
on LongBench and Needle-In-A-Haystack (NIAH). Besides, a custom Triton kernel,
FlashFourierAttention, is designed to optimize memory via streamlined
read-write operations, enabling efficient deployment without performance
compromise.

*Raphael Scheible-Schmitt,Johann Frei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GeistBERT通过增量训练和优化，提升了德语NLP任务的性能，并在多个任务中达到新SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 德语NLP需要针对其语言特性的现代模型和数据集，GeistBERT旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 基于GottBERT权重，使用Whole Word Masking预训练，并扩展为支持长序列的变体。

Result: 在NER和文本分类任务中表现优异，超越基础模型并达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: GeistBERT为德语NLP研究提供了高性能模型，并开源以支持社区发展。

Abstract: Advances in transformer-based language models have highlighted the benefits
of language-specific pre-training on high-quality corpora. In this context,
German NLP stands to gain from updated architectures and modern datasets
tailored to the linguistic characteristics of the German language. GeistBERT
seeks to improve German language processing by incrementally training on a
diverse corpus and optimizing model performance across various NLP tasks. It
was pre-trained using fairseq with standard hyperparameters, initialized from
GottBERT weights, and trained on a large-scale German corpus using Whole Word
Masking (WWM). Based on the pre-trained model, we derived extended-input
variants using Nystr\"omformer and Longformer architectures with support for
sequences up to 8k tokens. While these long-context models were not evaluated
on dedicated long-context benchmarks, they are included in our release. We
assessed all models on NER (CoNLL 2003, GermEval 2014) and text classification
(GermEval 2018 fine/coarse, 10kGNAD) using $F_1$ score and accuracy. The
GeistBERT models achieved strong performance, leading all tasks among the base
models and setting a new state-of-the-art (SOTA). Notably, the base models
outperformed larger models in several tasks. To support the German NLP research
community, we are releasing GeistBERT under the MIT license.

*Greta Damo,Elena Cabrio,Serena Villata*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于社会科学的计算框架，用于评估反仇恨言论（CS）的有效性，定义了六个核心维度，并标注了4,214个CS实例。两种分类策略表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线仇恨言论（HS）的缓解需要有效的反仇恨言论（CS），但目前缺乏评估其有效性的明确标准。

Method: 提出了一个计算框架，定义了六个核心维度（清晰度、证据、情感诉求、反驳、受众适应性和公平性），并标注了4,214个CS实例。提出了多任务和依赖关系两种分类策略。

Result: 两种分类策略在专家和用户撰写的CS上均表现优异（平均F1分别为0.94和0.96），优于基线方法，并揭示了维度间的强依赖性。

Conclusion: 该框架为CS有效性评估提供了新工具，分类策略的高效性为实际应用提供了支持。

Abstract: Counter-speech (CS) is a key strategy for mitigating online Hate Speech (HS),
yet defining the criteria to assess its effectiveness remains an open
challenge. We propose a novel computational framework for CS effectiveness
classification, grounded in social science concepts. Our framework defines six
core dimensions - Clarity, Evidence, Emotional Appeal, Rebuttal, Audience
Adaptation, and Fairness - which we use to annotate 4,214 CS instances from two
benchmark datasets, resulting in a novel linguistic resource released to the
community. In addition, we propose two classification strategies, multi-task
and dependency-based, achieving strong results (0.94 and 0.96 average F1
respectively on both expert- and user-written CS), outperforming standard
baselines, and revealing strong interdependence among dimensions.

### [109] [Feedback Friction: LLMs Struggle to Fully Incorporate External Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11930)
*Dongwei Jiang,Alvin Zhang,Andrew Wang,Nicholas Andrews,Daniel Khashabi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，即使在大语言模型（LLM）接收到近乎完美的外部反馈时，它们仍难以完全整合反馈并纠正错误答案，这种现象被称为“反馈摩擦”。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM在理想条件下整合外部反馈的能力，揭示其局限性。

Method: 设计实验环境，通过反馈生成器提供近乎完整的真实答案反馈，评估LLM在数学推理、知识推理等任务中的表现。

Result: LLM表现出对反馈的抵抗性（反馈摩擦），即使采用温度调节等策略，仍无法达到目标性能。

Conclusion: 反馈摩擦是LLM的显著局限性，排除了一些潜在原因，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown LLMs possess some ability to improve their
responses when given external feedback. However, it remains unclear how
effectively and thoroughly these models can incorporate extrinsic feedback. In
an ideal scenario, if LLMs receive near-perfect and complete feedback, we would
expect them to fully integrate the feedback and change their incorrect answers
to correct ones. In this paper, we systematically investigate LLMs' ability to
incorporate feedback by designing a controlled experimental environment. For
each problem, a solver model attempts a solution, then a feedback generator
with access to near-complete ground-truth answers produces targeted feedback,
after which the solver tries again. We evaluate this pipeline across a diverse
range of tasks, including math reasoning, knowledge reasoning, scientific
reasoning, and general multi-domain evaluations with state-of-the-art language
models including Claude 3.7 (with and without extended thinking). Surprisingly,
even under these near-ideal conditions, solver models consistently show
resistance to feedback, a limitation that we term FEEDBACK FRICTION. To
mitigate this limitation, we experiment with sampling-based strategies like
progressive temperature increases and explicit rejection of previously
attempted incorrect answers, which yield improvements but still fail to help
models achieve target performance. We also perform a rigorous exploration of
potential causes of FEEDBACK FRICTION, ruling out factors such as model
overconfidence and data familiarity. We hope that highlighting this issue in
LLMs and ruling out several apparent causes will help future research in
self-improvement.

### [110] [Improving Large Language Model Safety with Contrastive Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11938)
*Samuel Simko,Mrinmaya Sachan,Bernhard Schölkopf,Zhijing Jin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于对比表示学习的防御框架，通过三元组损失和对抗性硬负样本挖掘，提升大语言模型对多样化攻击的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLMs）易受对抗攻击，现有防御方法难以泛化到不同类型攻击，需要更通用的解决方案。

Method: 将模型防御问题转化为对比表示学习（CRL）任务，结合三元组损失和对抗性硬负样本挖掘，分离良性表示和有害表示。

Result: 实验表明，该方法优于现有基于表示工程的防御方法，提升了对抗输入级和嵌入空间攻击的鲁棒性，且不影响标准性能。

Conclusion: 提出的CRL框架为LLMs提供了一种有效的防御方法，具有广泛适用性和实际价值。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful tools with profound societal
impacts, yet their ability to generate responses to diverse and uncontrolled
inputs leaves them vulnerable to adversarial attacks. While existing defenses
often struggle to generalize across varying attack types, recent advancements
in representation engineering offer promising alternatives. In this work, we
propose a defense framework that formulates model defense as a contrastive
representation learning (CRL) problem. Our method finetunes a model using a
triplet-based loss combined with adversarial hard negative mining to encourage
separation between benign and harmful representations. Our experimental results
across multiple models demonstrate that our approach outperforms prior
representation engineering-based defenses, improving robustness against both
input-level and embedding-space attacks without compromising standard
performance. Our code is available at

*Yuliang Xu,Siming Huang,Mingmeng Geng,Yao Wan,Xuanhua Shi,Dongping Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）对代码风格的影响，分析了命名规范、复杂性、可维护性和相似性，发现LLMs显著改变了编程风格。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs的快速发展，代码生成能力正在改变编程实践，但LLMs是否以及如何影响代码风格尚不明确。

Method: 通过分析2020至2025年间19,000多个GitHub仓库的代码，量化了LLMs对代码风格的影响。

Result: 研究发现LLMs显著影响了代码风格，例如Python中snake_case变量名的比例从47%增至51%。

Conclusion: LLMs对现实世界编程风格产生了可测量的影响，但具体比例难以精确估计。

Abstract: Coding remains one of the most fundamental modes of interaction between
humans and machines. With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models
(LLMs), code generation capabilities have begun to significantly reshape
programming practices. This development prompts a central question: Have LLMs
transformed code style, and how can such transformation be characterized? In
this paper, we present a pioneering study that investigates the impact of LLMs
on code style, with a focus on naming conventions, complexity, maintainability,
and similarity. By analyzing code from over 19,000 GitHub repositories linked
to arXiv papers published between 2020 and 2025, we identify measurable trends
in the evolution of coding style that align with characteristics of
LLM-generated code. For instance, the proportion of snake\_case variable names
in Python code increased from 47% in Q1 2023 to 51% in Q1 2025. Furthermore, we
investigate how LLMs approach algorithmic problems by examining their reasoning
processes. Given the diversity of LLMs and usage scenarios, among other
factors, it is difficult or even impossible to precisely estimate the
proportion of code generated or assisted by LLMs. Our experimental results
provide the first large-scale empirical evidence that LLMs affect real-world
programming style.

Motivation: 研究目标是验证LLaVA-NeXT-interleave在多任务中的表现，并探索DCI连接器对模型性能的影响。

Method: 通过实验比较标准模型和DCI增强版在多个任务和数据集上的表现。

Result: 标准模型在视觉密集型任务中表现最佳，而DCI增强版在需要语义连贯性或结构化变化理解的任务中更优。

Conclusion: 结合基础模型与即插即用技术对Interleave任务具有潜力。

Abstract: This paper addresses two main objectives. Firstly, we demonstrate the
impressive performance of the LLaVA-NeXT-interleave on 22 datasets across three
different tasks: Multi-Image Reasoning, Documents and Knowledge-Based
Understanding and Interactive Multi-Modal Communication. Secondly, we add the
Dense Channel Integration (DCI) connector to the LLaVA-NeXT-Interleave and
compare its performance against the standard model. We find that the standard
model achieves the highest overall accuracy, excelling in vision-heavy tasks
like VISION, NLVR2, and Fashion200K. Meanwhile, the DCI-enhanced version shows
particular strength on datasets requiring deeper semantic coherence or
structured change understanding such as MIT-States_PropertyCoherence and
SlideVQA. Our results highlight the potential of combining powerful foundation
models with plug-and-play techniques for Interleave tasks. The code is

TL;DR: EfficientQuant是一种结构感知的后训练量化方法，针对混合卷积和Transformer模型，分别采用均匀量化和对数量化，显著降低延迟并保持精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混合卷积和Transformer模型在计算机视觉任务中表现优异，但在边缘设备上资源消耗大，现有量化方法应用有限。

Method: 提出EfficientQuant，对卷积块采用均匀量化，对Transformer块采用对数量化。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K数据集上实现2.5倍至8.7倍的延迟降低，精度损失极小，边缘设备上表现高效。

Conclusion: EfficientQuant为混合模型的边缘部署提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Hybrid models that combine convolutional and transformer blocks offer strong
performance in computer vision (CV) tasks but are resource-intensive for edge
deployment. Although post-training quantization (PTQ) can help reduce resource
demand, its application to hybrid models remains limited. We propose
EfficientQuant, a novel structure-aware PTQ approach that applies uniform
quantization to convolutional blocks and $log_2$ quantization to transformer
blocks. EfficientQuant achieves $2.5 \times - 8.7 \times$ latency reduction
with minimal accuracy loss on the ImageNet-1K dataset. It further demonstrates
low latency and memory efficiency on edge devices, making it practical for
real-world deployment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合ESRGAN和Faster R-CNN的方法，用于从低分辨率图像中提升目标检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低分辨率图像中目标检测性能不佳的问题，提供一种在图像质量不一致情况下的有效解决方案。

Method: 使用ESRGAN作为预处理步骤增强图像质量，再通过Faster R-CNN进行目标检测。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在低分辨率图像上的检测性能优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在图像质量受限的场景下提供了更鲁棒和可靠的目标检测解决方案。

Abstract: In this study, proposes a method for improved object detection from the
low-resolution images by integrating Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative
Adversarial Networks (ESRGAN) and Faster Region-Convolutional Neural Network
(Faster R-CNN). ESRGAN enhances low-quality images, restoring details and
improving clarity, while Faster R-CNN performs accurate object detection on the
enhanced images. The combination of these techniques ensures better detection
performance, even with poor-quality inputs, offering an effective solution for
applications where image resolution is in consistent. ESRGAN is employed as a
pre-processing step to enhance the low-resolution input image, effectively
restoring lost details and improving overall image quality. Subsequently, the
enhanced image is fed into the Faster R-CNN model for accurate object detection
and localization. Experimental results demonstrate that this integrated
approach yields superior performance compared to traditional methods applied
directly to low-resolution images. The proposed framework provides a promising
solution for applications where image quality is variable or limited, enabling
more robust and reliable object detection in challenging scenarios. It achieves
a balance between improved image quality and efficient object detection

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的RefAV框架，通过迭代代码生成和专门提示工程，解决了LLM生成代码的运行时错误和空间关系函数参数不准确的问题，显著提升了场景挖掘的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从海量自动驾驶数据（如Argoverse 2）中挖掘场景对开发和验证自动驾驶系统至关重要，但现有方法（如RefAV框架）存在LLM生成代码的运行时错误和空间关系函数参数不准确的问题。

Method: 提出两项改进：1）容错的迭代代码生成机制，通过错误反馈重新提示LLM优化代码；2）专门提示工程，提升LLM对空间关系函数的理解和正确应用。

Result: 在Argoverse 2验证集上测试多种LLM（Qwen2.5-VL-7B、Gemini 2.5 Flash和Gemini 2.5 Pro），系统表现一致提升，其中Gemini 2.5 Pro在官方测试集上HOTA-Temporal得分达52.37。

Conclusion: 改进后的RefAV框架显著提升了场景挖掘的可靠性和高精度，验证了所提技术的有效性。

Abstract: Scenario mining from extensive autonomous driving datasets, such as Argoverse
2, is crucial for the development and validation of self-driving systems. The
RefAV framework represents a promising approach by employing Large Language
Models (LLMs) to translate natural-language queries into executable code for
identifying relevant scenarios. However, this method faces challenges,
including runtime errors stemming from LLM-generated code and inaccuracies in
interpreting parameters for functions that describe complex multi-object
spatial relationships. This technical report introduces two key enhancements to
address these limitations: (1) a fault-tolerant iterative code-generation
mechanism that refines code by re-prompting the LLM with error feedback, and
(2) specialized prompt engineering that improves the LLM's comprehension and
correct application of spatial-relationship functions. Experiments on the
Argoverse 2 validation set with diverse LLMs-Qwen2.5-VL-7B, Gemini 2.5 Flash,
and Gemini 2.5 Pro-show consistent gains across multiple metrics; most notably,
the proposed system achieves a HOTA-Temporal score of 52.37 on the official
test set using Gemini 2.5 Pro. These results underline the efficacy of the
proposed techniques for reliable, high-precision scenario mining.

Motivation: 探索Agentic AI在复杂任务规划和工具配置中的潜力，减少数据科学家在计算机视觉应用开发中的手动工作。

Method: 扩展开源Cognitive AI环境SimpleMind，结合LLM代理（OpenManus）自动分解任务并配置工具，生成YAML格式的配置文件，自主执行训练和推理。

Result: 在50张胸部X光片上，系统自动配置、训练和测试，肺部、心脏和肋骨的Dice分数分别为0.96、0.82和0.83。

Conclusion: 展示了Agentic AI在计算机视觉任务中自主规划和工具配置的潜力，为自动化开发提供了新方向。

Abstract: Agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems leveraging Large Language Models
(LLMs) exhibit significant potential for complex reasoning, planning, and tool
utilization. We demonstrate that a specialized computer vision system can be
built autonomously from a natural language prompt using Agentic AI methods.
This involved extending SimpleMind (SM), an open-source Cognitive AI
environment with configurable tools for medical image analysis, with an
LLM-based agent, implemented using OpenManus, to automate the planning (tool
configuration) for a particular computer vision task. We provide a
proof-of-concept demonstration that an agentic system can interpret a computer
vision task prompt, plan a corresponding SimpleMind workflow by decomposing the
task and configuring appropriate tools. From the user input prompt, "provide sm
(SimpleMind) config for lungs, heart, and ribs segmentation for cxr (chest
x-ray)"), the agent LLM was able to generate the plan (tool configuration file
in YAML format), and execute SM-Learn (training) and SM-Think (inference)
scripts autonomously. The computer vision agent automatically configured,
trained, and tested itself on 50 chest x-ray images, achieving mean dice scores
of 0.96, 0.82, 0.83, for lungs, heart, and ribs, respectively. This work shows
the potential for autonomous planning and tool configuration that has
traditionally been performed by a data scientist in the development of computer
vision applications.

Motivation: 准确识别和分析密集且不稳定环境中的物体，尤其是铁矿石颗粒的分类和质量检测。

Method: 利用StarDist算法进行物体分割、轮廓确定、分类和物理尺寸测量。

Result: 开发了一种能检测平滑边界物体的新方法，显著提高了尺寸测量的准确性和颗粒分布分析的精确性。

Conclusion: 通过StarDist算法，为复杂的颗粒分类和测量问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We would like to present a comprehensive study on the classification of iron
ore pellets, aimed at identifying quality violations in the final product,
alongside the development of an innovative imagebased measurement method
utilizing the StarDist algorithm, which is primarily employed in the medical
field. This initiative is motivated by the necessity to accurately identify and
analyze objects within densely packed and unstable environments. The process
involves segmenting these objects, determining their contours, classifying
them, and measuring their physical dimensions. This is crucial because the size
distribution and classification of pellets such as distinguishing between nice
(quality) and joint (caused by the presence of moisture or indicating a process
of production failure) types are among the most significant characteristics
that define the quality of the final product. Traditional algorithms, including
image classification techniques using Vision Transformer (ViT), instance
segmentation methods like Mask R-CNN, and various anomaly segmentation
algorithms, have not yielded satisfactory results in this context.
Consequently, we explored methodologies from related fields to enhance our
approach. The outcome of our research is a novel method designed to detect
objects with smoothed boundaries. This advancement significantly improves the
accuracy of physical dimension measurements and facilitates a more precise
analysis of size distribution among the iron ore pellets. By leveraging the
strengths of the StarDist algorithm, we aim to provide a robust solution that
addresses the challenges posed by the complex nature of pellet classification
and measurement.

Motivation: 提高图像分割效率，同时不减小模型规模，适用于增强现实或机器人应用。

Method: 基于点提示提取图像裁剪，采用距离提示点越远、下采样率越高的可变分辨率补丁标记化。

Result: STT在保持分割性能的同时显著降低计算成本，可在消费硬件上实时运行。

Conclusion: STT是一种高效且实用的图像分割工具，适用于交互式应用。

Abstract: This paper presents Segment This Thing (STT), a new efficient image
segmentation model designed to produce a single segment given a single point
prompt. Instead of following prior work and increasing efficiency by decreasing
model size, we gain efficiency by foveating input images. Given an image and a
point prompt, we extract a crop centered on the prompt and apply a novel
variable-resolution patch tokenization in which patches are downsampled at a
rate that increases with increased distance from the prompt. This approach
yields far fewer image tokens than uniform patch tokenization. As a result we
can drastically reduce the computational cost of segmentation without reducing
model size. Furthermore, the foveation focuses the model on the region of
interest, a potentially useful inductive bias. We show that our Segment This
Thing model is more efficient than prior work while remaining competitive on
segmentation benchmarks. It can easily run at interactive frame rates on
consumer hardware and is thus a promising tool for augmented reality or
robotics applications.

TL;DR: 论文研究了基于机器学习和深度学习的自动疼痛检测模型在性别公平性上的表现，发现尽管Vision Transformer（ViT）在准确性和部分公平性指标上表现最佳，但所有模型均存在性别偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动疼痛检测在医疗领域潜力巨大，但算法在不同人口群体（如性别）中的准确性和公平性研究不足。

Method: 使用UNBC-McMaster Shoulder Pain Expression Archive Database，比较了传统ML算法（L SVM、RBF SVM）和DL方法（CNN、ViT）的性能和公平性。

Result: ViT在准确性和部分公平性指标上表现最佳，但所有模型均存在性别偏见。

Conclusion: 研究强调了准确性与公平性之间的权衡，并呼吁采用公平性感知技术以减少医疗系统中的偏见。

Abstract: Automated pain detection through machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL)
algorithms holds significant potential in healthcare, particularly for patients
unable to self-report pain levels. However, the accuracy and fairness of these
algorithms across different demographic groups (e.g., gender) remain
under-researched. This paper investigates the gender fairness of ML and DL
models trained on the UNBC-McMaster Shoulder Pain Expression Archive Database,
evaluating the performance of various models in detecting pain based solely on
the visual modality of participants' facial expressions. We compare traditional
ML algorithms, Linear Support Vector Machine (L SVM) and Radial Basis Function
SVM (RBF SVM), with DL methods, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision
Transformer (ViT), using a range of performance and fairness metrics. While ViT
achieved the highest accuracy and a selection of fairness metrics, all models
exhibited gender-based biases. These findings highlight the persistent
trade-off between accuracy and fairness, emphasising the need for
fairness-aware techniques to mitigate biases in automated healthcare systems.

Abstract: Estimating the 3D hand articulation from a single color image is a
continuously investigated problem with applications in Augmented Reality (AR),
Virtual Reality (VR), Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), and robotics. Apart
from the absence of depth information, occlusions, articulation complexity, and
the need for camera parameters knowledge pose additional challenges. In this
work, we propose an optimization pipeline for estimating the 3D hand
articulation from 2D keypoint input, which includes a keypoint alignment step
and a fingertip loss to overcome the need to know or estimate the camera
parameters. We evaluate our approach on the EgoDexter and Dexter+Object
benchmarks to showcase that our approach performs competitively with the SotA,
while also demonstrating its robustness when processing "in-the-wild" images
without any prior camera knowledge. Our quantitative analysis highlights the
sensitivity of the 2D keypoint estimation accuracy, despite the use of hand
priors. Code is available at https://github.com/cpantazop/HandRepo

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在图像分割中，保持分割结构（如血管、膜或道路）的拓扑结构至关重要，因为拓扑错误（如道路网络中的错误）会严重影响实际应用。

Method: 提出ContextLoss（CLoss）损失函数，通过考虑关键像素掩码中拓扑错误的完整上下文，改进拓扑正确性；同时提出两种直观指标验证连接性的改善。

Result: 在三个公共数据集（2D和3D）及自有的3D纳米成像数据集上验证，CLoss在拓扑感知指标上表现更优，修复的连接错误比现有方法多44%。

Conclusion: CLoss显著提升了图像分割的拓扑正确性，尤其在修复连接错误方面表现突出，代码已开源。

Abstract: In image segmentation, preserving the topology of segmented structures like
vessels, membranes, or roads is crucial. For instance, topological errors on
road networks can significantly impact navigation. Recently proposed solutions
are loss functions based on critical pixel masks that consider the whole
skeleton of the segmented structures in the critical pixel mask. We propose the
novel loss function ContextLoss (CLoss) that improves topological correctness
by considering topological errors with their whole context in the critical
pixel mask. The additional context improves the network focus on the
topological errors. Further, we propose two intuitive metrics to verify
improved connectivity due to a closing of missed connections. We benchmark our
proposed CLoss on three public datasets (2D & 3D) and our own 3D nano-imaging
dataset of bone cement lines. Training with our proposed CLoss increases
performance on topology-aware metrics and repairs up to 44% more missed
connections than other state-of-the-art methods. We make the code publicly
available.

feature upsampling to produce the high-resolution modalities required for
downstream tasks. In this work, we introduce JAFAR, a lightweight and flexible
feature upsampler that enhances the spatial resolution of visual features from
any Foundation Vision Encoder to an arbitrary target resolution. JAFAR employs
an attention-based module designed to promote semantic alignment between
high-resolution queries, derived from low-level image features, and
semantically enriched low-resolution keys, using Spatial Feature Transform
(SFT) modulation. Notably, despite the absence of high-resolution supervision,
we demonstrate that learning at low upsampling ratios and resolutions
generalizes remarkably well to significantly higher output scales. Extensive
experiments show that JAFAR effectively recovers fine-grained spatial details
and consistently outperforms existing feature upsampling methods across a
diverse set of downstream tasks. Project page at

### [123] [FARCLUSS: Fuzzy Adaptive Rebalancing and Contrastive Uncertainty Learning for Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11142)
*Ebenezer Tarubinga,Jenifer Kalafatovich*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种半监督语义分割框架，通过模糊伪标签、不确定性动态加权、自适应类别平衡和轻量对比正则化，有效利用未标记数据并改善类别不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在利用未标记数据时存在伪标签利用不足、类别不平衡偏差加剧以及忽略预测不确定性的问题。

Method: 框架包含四个组件：模糊伪标签（保留软类别分布）、不确定性动态加权（基于熵的可靠性评分）、自适应类别平衡（动态调整损失）和轻量对比正则化（优化特征嵌入）。

Result: 在基准测试中表现优于现有方法，显著提升了对少数类和模糊区域的分割效果。

Conclusion: 该框架通过将不确定性转化为学习资源，有效解决了半监督语义分割中的关键挑战。

Abstract: Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSSS) faces persistent challenges in
effectively leveraging unlabeled data, such as ineffective utilization of
pseudo-labels, exacerbation of class imbalance biases, and neglect of
prediction uncertainty. Current approaches often discard uncertain regions
through strict thresholding favouring dominant classes. To address these
limitations, we introduce a holistic framework that transforms uncertainty into
a learning asset through four principal components: (1) fuzzy pseudo-labeling,
which preserves soft class distributions from top-K predictions to enrich
supervision; (2) uncertainty-aware dynamic weighting, that modulate pixel-wise
contributions via entropy-based reliability scores; (3) adaptive class
rebalancing, which dynamically adjust losses to counteract long-tailed class
distributions; and (4) lightweight contrastive regularization, that encourage
compact and discriminative feature embeddings. Extensive experiments on
benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving significant improvements in the segmentation of
under-represented classes and ambiguous regions.

Motivation: 解决人类视频生成中运动自然性与视觉保真度之间的权衡问题。

Method: 提出AlignHuman框架，结合偏好优化（TPO）和分治训练策略，使用两个专用LoRAs模块分别优化不同时间段的运动动态和视觉保真度。

Result: 实验表明AlignHuman显著提升了基线性能，减少了推理时的NFEs（从100降至30），速度提升3.3倍且生成质量影响极小。

Conclusion: AlignHuman通过分时优化策略，有效平衡了运动自然性与视觉保真度，为高效高质量的人类动画生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advancements in human video generation and animation tasks, driven by
diffusion models, have achieved significant progress. However, expressive and
realistic human animation remains challenging due to the trade-off between
motion naturalness and visual fidelity. To address this, we propose
\textbf{AlignHuman}, a framework that combines Preference Optimization as a
post-training technique with a divide-and-conquer training strategy to jointly
optimize these competing objectives. Our key insight stems from an analysis of
the denoising process across timesteps: (1) early denoising timesteps primarily
control motion dynamics, while (2) fidelity and human structure can be
effectively managed by later timesteps, even if early steps are skipped.
Building on this observation, we propose timestep-segment preference
optimization (TPO) and introduce two specialized LoRAs as expert alignment
modules, each targeting a specific dimension in its corresponding timestep
interval. The LoRAs are trained using their respective preference data and
activated in the corresponding intervals during inference to enhance motion
naturalness and fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AlignHuman
improves strong baselines and reduces NFEs during inference, achieving a
3.3$\times$ speedup (from 100 NFEs to 30 NFEs) with minimal impact on
generation quality. Homepage:

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA) holds significant potential for
clinical decision support, yet existing efforts primarily focus on 2D imaging
with limited task diversity. This paper presents 3D-RAD, a large-scale dataset

computational tasks and multi-stage temporal analysis, to enable comprehensive
benchmarking. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that existing vision-language

Abstract: The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and large
language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the landscape of digital content
creation in different modalities. However, its potential use in Physical AI for
engineering design, where the production of physically viable artifacts is
paramount, remains vastly underexplored. The absence of physical knowledge in
existing LLM-to-3D models often results in outputs detached from real-world
physical constraints. To address this gap, we introduce LLM-to-Phy3D, a
physically conform online 3D object generation that enables existing LLM-to-3D
models to produce physically conforming 3D objects on the fly. LLM-to-Phy3D
introduces a novel online black-box refinement loop that empowers large
language models (LLMs) through synergistic visual and physics-based
evaluations. By delivering directional feedback in an iterative refinement
process, LLM-to-Phy3D actively drives the discovery of prompts that yield 3D
artifacts with enhanced physical performance and greater geometric novelty
relative to reference objects, marking a substantial contribution to AI-driven
generative design. Systematic evaluations of LLM-to-Phy3D, supported by
ablation studies in vehicle design optimization, reveal various LLM
improvements gained by 4.5% to 106.7% in producing physically conform target
domain 3D designs over conventional LLM-to-3D models. The encouraging results
suggest the potential general use of LLM-to-Phy3D in Physical AI for scientific

Method: 方法是通过CURSOR算法，利用EEG和图像数据学习恢复未知心理目标，无需标记数据或预训练解码器。

Result: 实验结果表明，CURSOR能够预测与人类感知判断相关的图像相似度分数，并利用这些分数对刺激进行排序，还能生成与未知心理目标无法区分的新刺激。

Conclusion: 结论是CURSOR框架在无标记数据的情况下，成功实现了心理目标的恢复和生成，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: We consider the problem of recovering a mental target (e.g., an image of a
face) that a participant has in mind from paired EEG (i.e., brain responses)
and image (i.e., perceived faces) data collected during interactive sessions
without access to labeled information. The problem has been previously explored
with labeled data but not via self-calibration, where labeled data is
unavailable. Here, we present the first framework and an algorithm, CURSOR,
that learns to recover unknown mental targets without access to labeled data or
pre-trained decoders. Our experiments on naturalistic images of faces
demonstrate that CURSOR can (1) predict image similarity scores that correlate
with human perceptual judgments without any label information, (2) use these
scores to rank stimuli against an unknown mental target, and (3) generate new
stimuli indistinguishable from the unknown mental target (validated via a user
study, N=53).

Conclusion: AutoCaption能有效提升视频字幕能力，MCTS-VCB为全面评估提供了新工具。

Abstract: Video captioning can be used to assess the video understanding capabilities
of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, existing benchmarks and
evaluation protocols suffer from crucial issues, such as inadequate or
homogeneous creation of key points, exorbitant cost of data creation, and
limited evaluation scopes. To address these issues, we propose an automatic
framework, named AutoCaption, which leverages Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to
construct numerous and diverse descriptive sentences (\textit{i.e.}, key
points) that thoroughly represent video content in an iterative way. This
iterative captioning strategy enables the continuous enhancement of video
details such as actions, objects' attributes, environment details, etc. We
apply AutoCaption to curate MCTS-VCB, a fine-grained video caption benchmark
covering video details, thereby enabling a comprehensive evaluation of MLLMs on
the video captioning task. We evaluate more than 20 open- and closed-source
MLLMs of varying sizes on MCTS-VCB. Results show that MCTS-VCB can effectively
and comprehensively evaluate the video captioning capability, with
Gemini-1.5-Pro achieving the highest F1 score of 71.2. Interestingly, we
fine-tune InternVL2.5-8B with the AutoCaption-generated data, which helps the
model achieve an overall improvement of 25.0% on MCTS-VCB and 16.3% on
DREAM-1K, further demonstrating the effectiveness of AutoCaption. The code and
data are available at https://github.com/tjunlp-lab/MCTS-VCB.

Abstract: Retrieving accurate details from documents is a crucial task, especially when
handling a combination of scanned images and native digital formats. This
document presents a combined framework for text extraction that merges Optical
Character Recognition (OCR) techniques with Large Language Models (LLMs) to
deliver structured outputs enriched by contextual understanding and confidence
indicators. Scanned files are processed using OCR engines, while digital files

Motivation: 理解人类社交行为（如情感识别和社会动态）是一个重要且具有挑战性的问题，而现有LLMs局限于文本领域，无法捕捉非语言线索的作用。VLMs可能填补这一空白，但其在社会推理中的能力尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 提出新任务“视觉社会-语用推理”，构建高质量数据集，并测试多个VLMs在该任务上的表现。

Result: 发现VLMs存在视觉社会-语用推理差距，并通过实验验证了这一局限性。

Conclusion: VLMs在社会推理中存在显著局限性，未来研究需进一步改进模型以填补这一差距。

Abstract: Understanding human social behavior such as recognizing emotions and the
social dynamics causing them is an important and challenging problem. While
LLMs have made remarkable advances, they are limited to the textual domain and
cannot account for the major role that non-verbal cues play in understanding
social situations. Vision Language Models (VLMs) can potentially account for
this gap, however their ability to make correct inferences over such social
cues has received little attention. In this paper, we explore the capabilities
of VLMs at social reasoning. We identify a previously overlooked limitation in
VLMs: the Visual Social-Pragmatic Inference gap. To target this gap, we propose
a new task for VLMs: Visual Social-Pragmatic Inference. We construct a high
quality dataset to test the abilities of a VLM for this task and benchmark the
performance of several VLMs on it.

Abstract: Visualizing the first few kilometers of the Earth's subsurface, a
long-standing challenge gating a virtually inexhaustible list of important
applications, is coming within reach through deep learning. Building on
techniques of generative artificial intelligence applied to voxelated images,
we demonstrate a method that extends surface geological data supplemented by
boreholes to a three-dimensional subsurface region by training a neural
network. The Earth's land area having been extensively mapped for geological
features, the bottleneck of this or any related technique is the availability
of data below the surface. We close this data gap in the development of
subsurface deep learning by designing a synthetic data-generator process that
mimics eons of geological activity such as sediment compaction, volcanic
intrusion, and tectonic dynamics to produce a virtually limitless number of
samples of the near lithosphere. A foundation model trained on such synthetic
data is able to generate a 3D image of the subsurface from a previously unseen
map of surface topography and geology, showing increasing fidelity with
increasing access to borehole data, depicting such structures as layers,
faults, folds, dikes, and sills. We illustrate the early promise of the
combination of a synthetic lithospheric generator with a trained neural network
model using generative flow matching. Ultimately, such models will be
fine-tuned on data from applicable campaigns, such as mineral prospecting in a
given region. Though useful in itself, a regionally fine-tuned models may be
employed not as an end but as a means: as an AI-based regularizer in a more
traditional inverse problem application, in which the objective function
represents the mismatch of additional data with physical models with
applications in resource exploration, hazard assessment, and geotechnical
engineering.

Abstract: This paper compares the performance of BiLSTM and CNN+GRU deep learning

the CNN+GRU model has a higher accuracy on the UT-HAR dataset (95.20%) thanks
to its ability to extract spatial features. In contrast, the BiLSTM model

Abstract: As a cornerstone of patient care, clinical decision-making significantly
influences patient outcomes and can be enhanced by large language models
(LLMs). Although LLMs have demonstrated remarkable performance, their
application to visual question answering in medical imaging, particularly for
reasoning-based diagnosis, remains largely unexplored. Furthermore, supervised
fine-tuning for reasoning tasks is largely impractical due to limited data
availability and high annotation costs. In this work, we introduce a zero-shot
framework for reliable medical image diagnosis that enhances the reasoning
capabilities of LLMs in clinical settings through test-time scaling. Given a
medical image and a textual prompt, a vision-language model processes a medical
image along with a corresponding textual prompt to generate multiple
descriptions or interpretations of visual features. These interpretations are
then fed to an LLM, where a test-time scaling strategy consolidates multiple
candidate outputs into a reliable final diagnosis. We evaluate our approach
across various medical imaging modalities -- including radiology,
ophthalmology, and histopathology -- and demonstrate that the proposed
test-time scaling strategy enhances diagnostic accuracy for both our and
baseline methods. Additionally, we provide an empirical analysis showing that
the proposed approach, which allows unbiased prompting in the first stage,
improves the reliability of LLM-generated diagnoses and enhances classification
accuracy.

Abstract: Rotation estimation plays a fundamental role in computer vision and robot
tasks, and extremely robust rotation estimation is significantly useful for
safety-critical applications. Typically, estimating a rotation is considered a
non-linear and non-convex optimization problem that requires careful design.
However, in this paper, we provide some new perspectives that solving a
rotation estimation problem can be reformulated as solving a linear model
fitting problem without dropping any constraints and without introducing any
singularities. In addition, we explore the dual structure of a rotation motion,
revealing that it can be represented as a great circle on a quaternion sphere
surface. Accordingly, we propose an easily understandable voting-based method
to solve rotation estimation. The proposed method exhibits exceptional
robustness to noise and outliers and can be computed in parallel with graphics
processing units (GPUs) effortlessly. Particularly, leveraging the power of
GPUs, the proposed method can obtain a satisfactory rotation solution for
large-scale($10^6$) and severely corrupted (99$\%$ outlier ratio) rotation
estimation problems under 0.5 seconds. Furthermore, to validate our theoretical
framework and demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method, we conduct
controlled experiments and real-world dataset experiments. These experiments
provide compelling evidence supporting the effectiveness and robustness of our
approach in solving rotation estimation problems.

Abstract: Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is essential for studying brain
function and diagnosing neurological disorders, but current analysis methods
face reproducibility and transferability issues due to complex pre-processing
and task-specific models. We introduce NeuroSTORM (Neuroimaging Foundation
Model with Spatial-Temporal Optimized Representation Modeling), a generalizable
framework that directly learns from 4D fMRI volumes and enables efficient
knowledge transfer across diverse applications. NeuroSTORM is pre-trained on
28.65 million fMRI frames (>9,000 hours) from over 50,000 subjects across
multiple centers and ages 5 to 100. Using a Mamba backbone and a shifted
scanning strategy, it efficiently processes full 4D volumes. We also propose a
spatial-temporal optimized pre-training approach and task-specific prompt
tuning to improve transferability. NeuroSTORM outperforms existing methods
across five tasks: age/gender prediction, phenotype prediction, disease
diagnosis, fMRI-to-image retrieval, and task-based fMRI classification. It
demonstrates strong clinical utility on datasets from hospitals in the U.S.,
South Korea, and Australia, achieving top performance in disease diagnosis and
cognitive phenotype prediction. NeuroSTORM provides a standardized, open-source
foundation model to improve reproducibility and transferability in fMRI-based

TL;DR: WaveFormer是一种轻量级Transformer架构，用于sEMG手势识别，通过可学习小波变换提升特征提取，在低资源设备上实现高精度和实时性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决相似手势分类准确率低及传统深度学习模型计算资源消耗大的问题。

Method: 提出WaveFormer，结合时域和频域特征，采用WaveletConv模块实现高效特征提取。

Result: 在EPN612数据集上达到95%分类准确率，INT8量化后推理延迟仅6.75毫秒。

Conclusion: WaveFormer在资源受限设备上实现了高效、高精度的sEMG手势识别。

Abstract: Human-machine interaction, particularly in prosthetic and robotic control,
has seen progress with gesture recognition via surface electromyographic (sEMG)
signals.However, classifying similar gestures that produce nearly identical
muscle signals remains a challenge, often reducing classification accuracy.
Traditional deep learning models for sEMG gesture recognition are large and
computationally expensive, limiting their deployment on resource-constrained
embedded systems. In this work, we propose WaveFormer, a lightweight
transformer-based architecture tailored for sEMG gesture recognition. Our model
integrates time-domain and frequency-domain features through a novel learnable
wavelet transform, enhancing feature extraction. In particular, the WaveletConv
module, a multi-level wavelet decomposition layer with depthwise separable
convolution, ensures both efficiency and compactness. With just 3.1 million
parameters, WaveFormer achieves 95% classification accuracy on the EPN612
dataset, outperforming larger models. Furthermore, when profiled on a laptop
equipped with an Intel CPU, INT8 quantization achieves real-time deployment
with a 6.75 ms inference latency.

Result: 实验表明SF-TMAT在恶劣场景下表现优越，具有强泛化能力。

Conclusion: SF-TMAT为无人机恶劣场景目标检测提供了有效解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) has shown promise in effectively
alleviating the performance degradation caused by domain gaps between source
and target domains, and it can potentially be generalized to UAV object
detection in adverse scenes. However, existing UDA studies are based on natural
images or clear UAV imagery, and research focused on UAV imagery in adverse
conditions is still in its infancy. Moreover, due to the unique perspective of
UAVs and the interference from adverse conditions, these methods often fail to
accurately align features and are influenced by limited or noisy pseudo-labels.
To address this, we propose the first benchmark for UAV object detection in
adverse scenes, the Statistical Feedback-Driven Threshold and Mask Adjustment
Teacher-Student Framework (SF-TMAT). Specifically, SF-TMAT introduces a design
called Dynamic Step Feedback Mask Adjustment Autoencoder (DSFMA), which
dynamically adjusts the mask ratio and reconstructs feature maps by integrating
training progress and loss feedback. This approach dynamically adjusts the
learning focus at different training stages to meet the model's needs for
learning features at varying levels of granularity. Additionally, we propose a
unique Variance Feedback Smoothing Threshold (VFST) strategy, which
statistically computes the mean confidence of each class and dynamically
adjusts the selection threshold by incorporating a variance penalty term. This
strategy improves the quality of pseudo-labels and uncovers potentially valid
labels, thus mitigating domain bias. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority and generalization capability of the proposed SF-TMAT in UAV object
detection under adverse scene conditions. The Code is released at
https://github.com/ChenHuyoo .

TL;DR: BrainMAP是一种新型多模态图学习框架，用于高效识别神经退行性疾病相关脑区，通过局部化分析和多模态融合显著降低计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图学习方法无法精确定位神经退行性疾病相关的脑区，且多模态模型计算复杂度高，限制了实际应用。

Method: BrainMAP采用AAL图谱引导的过滤方法提取关键脑子图，并通过跨节点注意力和自适应门控机制融合fMRI和DTI数据。

Result: BrainMAP在计算效率上优于现有方法，且预测准确性未受影响。

Conclusion: BrainMAP为神经退行性疾病的精确识别提供了一种高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent years have seen a surge in research focused on leveraging graph
learning techniques to detect neurodegenerative diseases. However, existing
graph-based approaches typically lack the ability to localize and extract the
specific brain regions driving neurodegenerative pathology within the full
connectome. Additionally, recent works on multimodal brain graph models often
suffer from high computational complexity, limiting their practical use in
resource-constrained devices. In this study, we present BrainMAP, a novel
multimodal graph learning framework designed for precise and computationally
efficient identification of brain regions affected by neurodegenerative
diseases. First, BrainMAP utilizes an atlas-driven filtering approach guided by
the AAL atlas to pinpoint and extract critical brain subgraphs. Unlike recent
state-of-the-art methods, which model the entire brain network, BrainMAP
achieves more than 50% reduction in computational overhead by concentrating on
disease-relevant subgraphs. Second, we employ an advanced multimodal fusion
process comprising cross-node attention to align functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data, coupled with an
adaptive gating mechanism to blend and integrate these modalities dynamically.
Experimental results demonstrate that BrainMAP outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in computational efficiency, without compromising predictive accuracy.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的YOLOv11模型，用于提高车辆速度检测的准确性，并能够区分车道和车辆类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 加州车辆数量增加，交通系统不足和测速摄像头稀疏，需要有效的车辆速度检测方法。

Method: 使用改进的YOLOv11模型，训练了近800张鸟瞰图像，检测车辆速度和车道，并分类车辆为轿车和重型车辆。

Result: 模型在MAE和MSE上表现优异，分别为0.97 mph和0.94 mph²。

Conclusion: 改进的YOLOv11模型在车辆速度检测和分类方面表现出色，适用于交通监控和法规执行。

Abstract: The increase in vehicle numbers in California, driven by inadequate
transportation systems and sparse speed cameras, necessitates effective vehicle
speed detection. Detecting vehicle speeds per lane is critical for monitoring
High-Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lane speeds, distinguishing between cars and heavy
vehicles with differing speed limits, and enforcing lane restrictions for heavy
vehicles. While prior works utilized YOLO (You Only Look Once) for vehicle
speed detection, they often lacked accuracy, failed to identify vehicle lanes,
and offered limited or less practical classification categories. This study
introduces a fine-tuned YOLOv11 model, trained on almost 800 bird's-eye view
images, to enhance vehicle speed detection accuracy which is much higher
compare to the previous works. The proposed system identifies the lane for each
vehicle and classifies vehicles into two categories: cars and heavy vehicles.
Designed to meet the specific requirements of traffic monitoring and
regulation, the model also evaluates the effects of factors such as drone
height, distance of Region of Interest (ROI), and vehicle speed on detection
accuracy and speed measurement. Drone footage collected from Northern
California was used to assess the proposed system. The fine-tuned YOLOv11
achieved its best performance with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.97 mph and
mean squared error (MSE) of 0.94 $\text{mph}^2$, demonstrating its efficacy in
addressing challenges in vehicle speed detection and classification.

Result: 知识追踪机器遗忘更符合实际需求和人脑遗忘机制。

Conclusion: 知识追踪机器遗忘是基础模型遗忘的有效范式。

Abstract: Machine unlearning removes certain training data points and their influence
on AI models (e.g., when a data owner revokes their decision to allow models to
learn from the data). In this position paper, we propose to lift data-tracing
machine unlearning to knowledge-tracing for foundation models (FMs). We support
this position based on practical needs and insights from cognitive studies.
Practically, tracing data cannot meet the diverse unlearning requests for FMs,
which may be from regulators, enterprise users, product teams, etc., having no
access to FMs' massive training data. Instead, it is convenient for these
parties to issue an unlearning request about the knowledge or capability FMs
(should not) possess. Cognitively, knowledge-tracing unlearning aligns with how
the human brain forgets more closely than tracing individual training data
points. Finally, we provide a concrete case study about a vision-language FM to
illustrate how an unlearner might instantiate the knowledge-tracing machine
unlearning paradigm.

Abstract: World models aim to simulate environments and enable effective agent
behavior. However, modeling real-world environments presents unique challenges
as they dynamically change across both space and, crucially, time. To capture
these composed dynamics, we introduce a Spatio-Temporal Road Image Dataset for
Exploration (STRIDE) permuting 360-degree panoramic imagery into rich
interconnected observation, state and action nodes. Leveraging this structure,
we can simultaneously model the relationship between egocentric views,
positional coordinates, and movement commands across both space and time. We
benchmark this dataset via TARDIS, a transformer-based generative world model
that integrates spatial and temporal dynamics through a unified autoregressive
framework trained on STRIDE. We demonstrate robust performance across a range
of agentic tasks such as controllable photorealistic image synthesis,
instruction following, autonomous self-control, and state-of-the-art
georeferencing. These results suggest a promising direction towards
sophisticated generalist agents--capable of understanding and manipulating the
spatial and temporal aspects of their material environments--with enhanced
embodied reasoning capabilities. Training code, datasets, and model checkpoints

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准数据集多局限于分割或分类任务，且地理覆盖范围有限，因此需要更全面的评估Geo-FMs的数据集。

Method: 结合EnMAP卫星的高光谱影像和GEDI激光雷达的AGB密度估计，构建了一个覆盖七大洲的像素级回归任务数据集。

Result: 实验表明，Geo-FMs在某些情况下性能优于基线U-Net，尤其是微调编码器时；性能差异与区域数据集大小和Vision Transformer的token patch大小有关。

Conclusion: 该数据集的发布有助于Geo-FMs的开发与评估，并促进地理偏见和泛化能力的研究。

Abstract: Comprehensive evaluation of geospatial foundation models (Geo-FMs) requires
benchmarking across diverse tasks, sensors, and geographic regions. However,
most existing benchmark datasets are limited to segmentation or classification
tasks, and focus on specific geographic areas. To address this gap, we
introduce a globally distributed dataset for forest aboveground biomass (AGB)
estimation, a pixel-wise regression task. This benchmark dataset combines
co-located hyperspectral imagery (HSI) from the Environmental Mapping and
Analysis Program (EnMAP) satellite and predictions of AGB density estimates
derived from the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation lidars, covering seven
continental regions. Our experimental results on this dataset demonstrate that
the evaluated Geo-FMs can match or, in some cases, surpass the performance of a
baseline U-Net, especially when fine-tuning the encoder. We also find that the
performance difference between the U-Net and Geo-FMs depends on the dataset
size for each region and highlight the importance of the token patch size in
the Vision Transformer backbone for accurate predictions in pixel-wise
regression tasks. By releasing this globally distributed hyperspectral
benchmark dataset, we aim to facilitate the development and evaluation of
Geo-FMs for HSI applications. Leveraging this dataset additionally enables
research into geographic bias and generalization capacity of Geo-FMs. The
dataset and source code will be made publicly available.

Result: 通过标准化训练协议对最先进模型进行基准测试，验证了数据集的质量和多功能性。

Conclusion: GynSurg数据集的发布将加速妇科腹腔镜手术领域的研究进展。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have transformed computer-assisted
intervention and surgical video analysis, driving improvements not only in
surgical training, intraoperative decision support, and patient outcomes, but
also in postoperative documentation and surgical discovery. Central to these
developments is the availability of large, high-quality annotated datasets. In
gynecologic laparoscopy, surgical scene understanding and action recognition
are fundamental for building intelligent systems that assist surgeons during
operations and provide deeper analysis after surgery. However, existing
datasets are often limited by small scale, narrow task focus, or insufficiently
detailed annotations, limiting their utility for comprehensive, end-to-end
workflow analysis. To address these limitations, we introduce GynSurg, the
largest and most diverse multi-task dataset for gynecologic laparoscopic
surgery to date. GynSurg provides rich annotations across multiple tasks,
supporting applications in action recognition, semantic segmentation, surgical
documentation, and discovery of novel procedural insights. We demonstrate the
dataset quality and versatility by benchmarking state-of-the-art models under a
standardized training protocol. To accelerate progress in the field, we
publicly release the GynSurg dataset and its annotations

<details>

Motivation: 图像生成模型的快速发展带来了滥用风险（如深度伪造、钓鱼攻击等），需要有效的真实性验证机制。传统水印技术因重标记不匹配问题难以直接应用于图像生成模型。

Method: 提出C-reweight方法，通过基于聚类的策略等效处理同一簇内的标记，避免重标记不匹配并保持图像保真度。

Result: 在主流图像生成平台上的评估表明，C-reweight在保持图像质量的同时，显著优于现有无失真水印技术的可检测性。

Conclusion: C-reweight为安全可信的图像合成设定了新标准。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of image generation models has revolutionized visual
content creation, enabling the synthesis of highly realistic and contextually
accurate images for diverse applications. However, the potential for misuse,
such as deepfake generation, image based phishing attacks, and fabrication of
misleading visual evidence, underscores the need for robust authenticity
verification mechanisms. While traditional statistical watermarking techniques
have proven effective for autoregressive language models, their direct
adaptation to image generation models encounters significant challenges due to
a phenomenon we term retokenization mismatch, a disparity between original and
retokenized sequences during the image generation process. To overcome this
limitation, we propose C-reweight, a novel, distortion-free watermarking method
explicitly designed for image generation models. By leveraging a
clustering-based strategy that treats tokens within the same cluster
equivalently, C-reweight mitigates retokenization mismatch while preserving
image fidelity. Extensive evaluations on leading image generation platforms
reveal that C-reweight not only maintains the visual quality of generated
images but also improves detectability over existing distortion-free
watermarking techniques, setting a new standard for secure and trustworthy
image synthesis.

Abstract: Subspace clustering has become widely adopted for the unsupervised analysis
of hyperspectral images (HSIs). Recent model-aware deep subspace clustering
methods often use a two-stage framework, involving the calculation of a
self-representation matrix with complexity of O(n^2), followed by spectral
clustering. However, these methods are computationally intensive, generally
incorporating solely either local or non-local spatial structure constraints,
and their structural constraints fall short of effectively supervising the
entire clustering process.
  We propose a scalable, context-preserving deep clustering method based on
basis representation, which jointly captures local and non-local structures for
efficient HSI clustering. To preserve local structure (i.e., spatial continuity
within subspaces), we introduce a spatial smoothness constraint that aligns
clustering predictions with their spatially filtered versions. For non-local
structure (i.e., spectral continuity), we employ a mini-cluster-based scheme
that refines predictions at the group level, encouraging spectrally similar
pixels to belong to the same subspace. Notably, these two constraints are
jointly optimized to reinforce each other.
  Specifically, our model is designed as an one-stage approach in which the
structural constraints are applied to the entire clustering process. The time
and space complexity of our method is O(n), making it applicable to large-scale
HSI data. Experiments on real-world datasets show that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art techniques. Our code is available at:

Abstract: People get informed of a daily task plan through diverse media involving both
texts and images. However, most prior research only focuses on LLM's capability
of textual plan generation. The potential of large-scale models in providing
text-image plans remains understudied. Generating high-quality text-image plans
faces two main challenges: ensuring consistent alignment between two modalities
and keeping coherence among visual steps. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel framework that generates and refines text-image plans
step-by-step. At each iteration, our framework (1) drafts the next textual step
based on the prediction history; (2) edits the last visual step to obtain the
next one; (3) extracts PDDL-like visual information; and (4) refines the draft
with the extracted visual information. The textual and visual step produced in
stage (4) and (2) will then serve as inputs for the next iteration. Our
approach offers a plug-and-play improvement to various backbone models, such as
Mistral-7B, Gemini-1.5, and GPT-4o. To evaluate the effectiveness of our
approach, we collect a new benchmark consisting of 1,100 tasks and their
text-image pair solutions covering 11 daily topics. We also design and validate
a new set of metrics to evaluate the multimodal consistency and coherence in
text-image plans. Extensive experiment results show the effectiveness of our
approach on a range of backbone models against competitive baselines. Our code

Conclusion: 动态双向空间塔显著提升了模型对空间关系的理解和推理能力，为多模态任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: The Visual Question Answering (VQA) task requires the simultaneous
understanding of image content and question semantics. However, existing
methods often have difficulty handling complex reasoning scenarios due to
insufficient cross-modal interaction and capturing the entity spatial
relationships in the
image.\cite{huang2023adaptive}\cite{liu2021comparing}\cite{guibas2021adaptive}\cite{zhang2022vsa}We
studied a brand-new approach to replace the attention mechanism in order to
enhance the reasoning ability of the model and its understanding of spatial
relationships.Specifically, we propose a dynamic bidirectional spatial tower,
which is divided into four layers to observe the image according to the
principle of human gestalt vision. This naturally provides a powerful
structural prior for the spatial organization between entities, enabling the
model to no longer blindly search for relationships between pixels but make
judgments based on more meaningful perceptual units. Change from "seeing
images" to "perceiving and organizing image content".A large number of
experiments have shown that our module can be used in any other multimodal
model and achieve advanced results, demonstrating its potential in spatial
relationship processing.Meanwhile, the multimodal visual question-answering
model July trained by our method has achieved state-of-the-art results with
only 3B parameters, especially on the question-answering dataset of spatial
relations.

Conclusion: \mymethod通过聚焦相关目标区域，显著减少了MLLMs的幻觉问题，提高了模型的实用性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) frequently suffer from hallucination
issues, generating information about objects that are not present in input
images during vision-language tasks. These hallucinations particularly
undermine model reliability in practical applications requiring accurate object
identification. To address this challenge, we propose \mymethod,\ a preference
learning approach that mitigates hallucinations by focusing on targeted areas
where they occur. To implement this, we build a dataset containing hallucinated
responses, correct responses, and target information (i.e., objects present in
the images and the corresponding chunk positions in responses affected by
hallucinations). By applying a preference learning method restricted to these
specific targets, the model can filter out irrelevant signals and focus on
correcting hallucinations. This allows the model to produce more factual
responses by concentrating solely on relevant information. Experimental results
demonstrate that \mymethod\ effectively reduces hallucinations across multiple
vision hallucination tasks, improving the reliability and performance of MLLMs
without diminishing overall performance.

Conclusion: Auto-Connect显著提升了骨骼自动装配的拓扑准确性和变形质量。

Abstract: We introduce Auto-Connect, a novel approach for automatic rigging that
explicitly preserves skeletal connectivity through a connectivity-preserving
tokenization scheme. Unlike previous methods that predict bone positions
represented as two joints or first predict points before determining
connectivity, our method employs special tokens to define endpoints for each
joint's children and for each hierarchical layer, effectively automating
connectivity relationships. This approach significantly enhances topological
accuracy by integrating connectivity information directly into the prediction
framework. To further guarantee high-quality topology, we implement a
topology-aware reward function that quantifies topological correctness, which
is then utilized in a post-training phase through reward-guided Direct
Preference Optimization. Additionally, we incorporate implicit geodesic
features for latent top-k bone selection, which substantially improves skinning
quality. By leveraging geodesic distance information within the model's latent
space, our approach intelligently determines the most influential bones for
each vertex, effectively mitigating common skinning artifacts. This combination
of connectivity-preserving tokenization, reward-guided fine-tuning, and
geodesic-aware bone selection enables our model to consistently generate more
anatomically plausible skeletal structures with superior deformation
properties.

Method: 提出FSCA框架，利用文本到图像扩散模型中的两种语义连接进行审计，无需内部知识。

Result: 在LAION-mi和COCO数据集上实验，FSCA在多种指标和数据分布下优于八种基线方法，用户级准确率达90%。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion model since its propose has significantly influenced
the content creation due to its impressive generation capability. However, this
capability depends on large-scale text-image datasets gathered from web
platforms like social media, posing substantial challenges in copyright
compliance and personal privacy leakage. Though there are some efforts devoted
to explore approaches for auditing data provenance in text-to-image diffusion
models, existing work has unrealistic assumptions that can obtain model
internal knowledge, e.g., intermediate results, or the evaluation is not
reliable. To fill this gap, we propose a completely black-box auditing
framework called Feature Semantic Consistency-based Auditing (FSCA). It
utilizes two types of semantic connections within the text-to-image diffusion
model for auditing, eliminating the need for access to internal knowledge. To
demonstrate the effectiveness of our FSCA framework, we perform extensive
experiments on LAION-mi dataset and COCO dataset, and compare with eight
state-of-the-art baseline approaches. The results show that FSCA surpasses
previous baseline approaches across various metrics and different data
distributions, showcasing the superiority of our FSCA. Moreover, we introduce a
recall balance strategy and a threshold adjustment strategy, which collectively
allows FSCA to reach up a user-level accuracy of 90% in a real-world auditing
scenario with only 10 samples/user, highlighting its strong auditing potential
in real-world applications. Our code is made available at

TL;DR: TAViS框架通过结合多模态基础模型（ImageBind）和分割基础模型（SAM2），解决了音频-视觉分割中的跨模态对齐问题，并通过文本桥接设计和监督策略提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音频-视觉分割（AVS）面临跨模态对齐的挑战，现有方法未能有效结合多模态知识或解决特征空间差异问题。

Method: TAViS引入文本桥接设计，包括混合提示机制和基于文本的对齐监督策略，以结合ImageBind和SAM2的优势。

Result: TAViS在单源、多源、语义数据集及零样本设置中表现优异。

Conclusion: TAViS通过创新的跨模态对齐方法，显著提升了音频-视觉分割的性能。

Abstract: Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) faces a fundamental challenge of effectively
aligning audio and visual modalities. While recent approaches leverage
foundation models to address data scarcity, they often rely on single-modality
knowledge or combine foundation models in an off-the-shelf manner, failing to
address the cross-modal alignment challenge. In this paper, we present TAViS, a
novel framework that \textbf{couples} the knowledge of multimodal foundation
models (ImageBind) for cross-modal alignment and a segmentation foundation
model (SAM2) for precise segmentation. However, effectively combining these
models poses two key challenges: the difficulty in transferring the knowledge
between SAM2 and ImageBind due to their different feature spaces, and the
insufficiency of using only segmentation loss for supervision. To address these
challenges, we introduce a text-bridged design with two key components: (1) a
text-bridged hybrid prompting mechanism where pseudo text provides class
prototype information while retaining modality-specific details from both audio
and visual inputs, and (2) an alignment supervision strategy that leverages
text as a bridge to align shared semantic concepts within audio-visual
modalities. Our approach achieves superior performance on single-source,
multi-source, semantic datasets, and excels in zero-shot settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统癌症亚型分类模型依赖大量专家标注，而标注资源有限。为此，引入不确定性感知以优化模型训练和标注效率。

Method: 在自监督对比学习模型中计算证据向量，评估预测置信度，利用不确定性分数选择关键图像进行标注，迭代优化训练过程。

Result: 仅需1-10%的标注即可在基准数据集上实现最优性能，显著提升分类精度和效率。

Conclusion: 该方法在标注数据有限的情况下表现出色，为数字病理学中的癌症亚型分类提供了新方向。

Abstract: Machine-learning-assisted cancer subtyping is a promising avenue in digital
pathology. Cancer subtyping models, however, require careful training using
expert annotations so that they can be inferred with a degree of known
certainty (or uncertainty). To this end, we introduce the concept of
uncertainty awareness into a self-supervised contrastive learning model. This
is achieved by computing an evidence vector at every epoch, which assesses the
model's confidence in its predictions. The derived uncertainty score is then
utilized as a metric to selectively label the most crucial images that require
further annotation, thus iteratively refining the training process. With just
1-10% of strategically selected annotations, we attain state-of-the-art
performance in cancer subtyping on benchmark datasets. Our method not only
strategically guides the annotation process to minimize the need for extensive
labeled datasets, but also improves the precision and efficiency of
classifications. This development is particularly beneficial in settings where
the availability of labeled data is limited, offering a promising direction for
future research and application in digital pathology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为V2LMs的新型视觉语言模型，用于提升自动驾驶车辆（AV）感知任务的鲁棒性，无需对抗训练即可抵御未知攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度神经网络（DNNs）在自动驾驶任务中易受攻击，且现有防御机制（如对抗训练）会降低正常精度且难以泛化。

Method: 通过微调视觉语言模型（V2LMs），提出两种部署模式：Solo Mode（单任务）和Tandem Mode（多任务统一）。

Result: 实验表明，V2LMs在对抗条件下平均精度下降小于8%，优于传统DNNs（下降33%-46%）。Tandem Mode在内存效率上表现更优。

Conclusion: V2LMs为构建更安全、鲁棒的AV感知系统提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) rely on deep neural networks (DNNs) for critical
tasks such as traffic sign recognition (TSR), automated lane centering (ALC),
and vehicle detection (VD). However, these models are vulnerable to attacks
that can cause misclassifications and compromise safety. Traditional defense
mechanisms, including adversarial training, often degrade benign accuracy and
fail to generalize against unseen attacks. In this work, we introduce Vehicle
Vision Language Models (V2LMs), fine-tuned vision-language models specialized
for AV perception. Our findings demonstrate that V2LMs inherently exhibit
superior robustness against unseen attacks without requiring adversarial
training, maintaining significantly higher accuracy than conventional DNNs
under adversarial conditions. We evaluate two deployment strategies: Solo Mode,
where individual V2LMs handle specific perception tasks, and Tandem Mode, where
a single unified V2LM is fine-tuned for multiple tasks simultaneously.
Experimental results reveal that DNNs suffer performance drops of 33% to 46%
under attacks, whereas V2LMs maintain adversarial accuracy with reductions of
less than 8% on average. The Tandem Mode further offers a memory-efficient
alternative while achieving comparable robustness to Solo Mode. We also explore
integrating V2LMs as parallel components to AV perception to enhance resilience
against adversarial threats. Our results suggest that V2LMs offer a promising
path toward more secure and resilient AV perception systems.

TL;DR: FAME是一种轻量级时空框架，用于识别Deepfake视频的来源模型，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfake视频对数字安全、隐私和媒体完整性构成威胁，需要有效工具识别其来源模型。

Method: FAME通过多级嵌入和时空注意力机制捕捉不同生成模型的细微伪影。

Result: 在DFDM、FaceForensics++和FakeAVCeleb数据集上，FAME在准确性和运行时均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FAME具有在实际法医和信息安全应用中部署的潜力。

Abstract: The widespread emergence of face-swap Deepfake videos poses growing risks to
digital security, privacy, and media integrity, necessitating effective
forensic tools for identifying the source of such manipulations. Although most
prior research has focused primarily on binary Deepfake detection, the task of
model attribution -- determining which generative model produced a given
Deepfake -- remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce FAME (Fake
Attribution via Multilevel Embeddings), a lightweight and efficient
spatio-temporal framework designed to capture subtle generative artifacts
specific to different face-swap models. FAME integrates spatial and temporal
attention mechanisms to improve attribution accuracy while remaining
computationally efficient. We evaluate our model on three challenging and
diverse datasets: Deepfake Detection and Manipulation (DFDM), FaceForensics++,
and FakeAVCeleb. Results show that FAME consistently outperforms existing
methods in both accuracy and runtime, highlighting its potential for deployment
in real-world forensic and information security applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为环境变化检测（ECD）的新任务，解决了传统场景变化检测（SCD）中依赖理想化对齐查询-参考图像的局限性。通过利用未整理的大规模图像数据库，提出了一种联合理解空间环境和检测变化的框架，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SCD依赖理想化的对齐查询-参考图像，而现实中参考图像通常视角不一致。为了解决这一局限性，论文提出了ECD任务，更贴近实际应用场景。

Method: 提出了一种新框架，通过利用多个参考候选和聚合语义丰富的表示来检测变化，解决了视角不对齐和有限视野覆盖的问题。

Result: 在三个标准基准集上的实验表明，该方法显著优于现有方法的简单组合，性能接近理想化设置。

Conclusion: ECD任务和提出的框架为实际场景中的变化检测提供了更实用的解决方案，代码将在论文接受后公开。

Abstract: Humans do not memorize everything. Thus, humans recognize scene changes by
exploring the past images. However, available past (i.e., reference) images
typically represent nearby viewpoints of the present (i.e., query) scene,
rather than the identical view. Despite this practical limitation, conventional
Scene Change Detection (SCD) has been formalized under an idealized setting in
which reference images with matching viewpoints are available for every query.
In this paper, we push this problem toward a practical task and introduce
Environmental Change Detection (ECD). A key aspect of ECD is to avoid
unrealistically aligned query-reference pairs and rely solely on environmental
cues. Inspired by real-world practices, we provide these cues through a
large-scale database of uncurated images. To address this new task, we propose
a novel framework that jointly understands spatial environments and detects
changes. The main idea is that matching at the same spatial locations between a
query and a reference may lead to a suboptimal solution due to viewpoint
misalignment and limited field-of-view (FOV) coverage. We deal with this
limitation by leveraging multiple reference candidates and aggregating
semantically rich representations for change detection. We evaluate our
framework on three standard benchmark sets reconstructed for ECD, and
significantly outperform a naive combination of state-of-the-art methods while
achieving comparable performance to the oracle setting. The code will be
released upon acceptance.

Abstract: The advent of accessible Generative AI tools enables anyone to create and
spread synthetic images on social media, often with the intention to mislead,
thus posing a significant threat to online information integrity. Most existing
Synthetic Image Detection (SID) solutions struggle on generated images sourced
from the Internet, as these are often altered by compression and other
operations. To address this, our research enhances SID by exploring data
augmentation combinations, leveraging a genetic algorithm for optimal
augmentation selection, and introducing a dual-criteria optimization approach.
These methods significantly improve model performance under real-world
perturbations. Our findings provide valuable insights for developing detection
models capable of identifying synthetic images across varying qualities and
transformations, with the best-performing model achieving a mean average
precision increase of +22.53% compared to models without augmentations. The

Motivation: 现有的多模态预训练模型（如CLIP）在UDA中表现优异，但视觉嵌入分布可能偏离预训练模型，导致误导信号。

Result: 实验验证了方法的有效性，展示了性能提升和目标提示表示质量的改进。

Conclusion: 该方法通过几何嵌入特性强化伪标签，显著提升了UDA的性能。

Abstract: Recent approaches leveraging multi-modal pre-trained models like CLIP for
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) have shown significant promise in bridging
domain gaps and improving generalization by utilizing rich semantic knowledge
and robust visual representations learned through extensive pre-training on
diverse image-text datasets. While these methods achieve state-of-the-art
performance across benchmarks, much of the improvement stems from base
pseudo-labels (CLIP zero-shot predictions) and self-training mechanisms. Thus,
the training mechanism exhibits a key limitation wherein the visual embedding
distribution in target domains can deviate from the visual embedding
distribution in the pre-trained model, leading to misguided signals from class
descriptions. This work introduces a fresh solution to reinforce these
pseudo-labels and facilitate target-prompt learning, by exploiting the geometry
of visual and text embeddings - an aspect that is overlooked by existing
methods. We first propose to directly leverage the reference predictions (from
source prompts) based on the relationship between source and target visual
embeddings. We later show that there is a strong clustering behavior observed
between visual and text embeddings in pre-trained multi-modal models. Building
on optimal transport theory, we transform this insight into a novel strategy to
enforce the clustering property in text embeddings, further enhancing the
alignment in the target domain. Our experiments and ablation studies validate
the effectiveness of the proposed approach, demonstrating superior performance
and improved quality of target prompts in terms of representation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Manager的轻量级插件，通过自适应聚合预训练单模态专家的不同层级知识，提升视觉-语言模型的性能。在Two-Tower VLM和MLLM架构中均表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决BridgeTower在单模态表示利用、语义知识灵活性和低分辨率数据集评估上的局限性。

Method: 引入ManagerTower，在跨模态层中嵌入Manager插件，自适应聚合单模态专家知识。

Result: 在4个下游VL任务中超越基线，LLaVA-OV-Manager在20个数据集上显著提升零样本性能。

Conclusion: Manager和多网格算法协同工作，从深度和宽度两个角度提升视觉表示，缓解语义模糊性。

Abstract: Two-Tower Vision--Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance
across various downstream VL tasks. While BridgeTower further enhances
performance by building bridges between encoders, it \textit{(i)} suffers from
ineffective layer-by-layer utilization of unimodal representations,
\textit{(ii)} restricts the flexible exploitation of different levels of
unimodal semantic knowledge, and \textit{(iii)} is limited to the evaluation on
traditional low-resolution datasets only with the Two-Tower VLM architecture.
In this work, we propose Manager, a lightweight, efficient and effective plugin
that adaptively aggregates insights from different levels of pre-trained
unimodal experts to facilitate more comprehensive VL alignment and fusion.
First, under the Two-Tower VLM architecture, we introduce ManagerTower, a novel
VLM that introduces the manager in each cross-modal layer. Whether with or
without VL pre-training, ManagerTower outperforms previous strong baselines and
achieves superior performance on 4 downstream VL tasks. Moreover, we extend our
exploration to the latest Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) architecture.
We demonstrate that LLaVA-OV-Manager significantly boosts the zero-shot
performance of LLaVA-OV across different categories of capabilities, images,
and resolutions on 20 downstream datasets, whether the multi-grid algorithm is
enabled or not. In-depth analysis reveals that both our manager and the
multi-grid algorithm can be viewed as a plugin that improves the visual
representation by capturing more diverse visual details from two orthogonal
perspectives (depth and width). Their synergy can mitigate the semantic
ambiguity caused by the multi-grid algorithm and further improve performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传感器平台初始化时，有限的初始测量可能导致估计不准确，陷入局部最优。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 延迟使用全局GNSS测量，先依赖相对距离残差，通过Hessian矩阵奇异值变化确定切换时机。

Result: 在EuRoC和GVINS数据集上，该方法比直接使用全局GNSS数据的策略表现更优。

Conclusion: 提出的策略能更准确、鲁棒地完成初始化，避免局部最优。

Abstract: Initializing the state of a sensorized platform can be challenging, as a
limited set of initial measurements often carry limited information, leading to
poor initial estimates that may converge to local minima during non-linear
optimization. This paper proposes a novel GNSS-inertial initialization strategy
that delays the use of global GNSS measurements until sufficient information is
available to accurately estimate the transformation between the GNSS and
inertial frames. Instead, the method initially relies on GNSS relative distance
residuals. To determine the optimal moment for switching to global
measurements, we introduce a criterion based on the evolution of the Hessian
matrix singular values. Experiments on the EuRoC and GVINS datasets show that
our approach consistently outperforms the naive strategy of using global GNSS
data from the start, yielding more accurate and robust initializations.

Result: 在多种视觉任务和ViT架构上的实验表明，FIMA-Q显著提升了量化精度，尤其在低比特量化下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FIMA-Q是一种高效的后训练量化方法，能够显著提升ViTs在低比特量化下的精度，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has stood out as a cost-effective and
promising model compression paradigm in recent years, as it avoids
computationally intensive model retraining. Nevertheless, current PTQ methods
for Vision Transformers (ViTs) still suffer from significant accuracy
degradation, especially under low-bit quantization. To address these
shortcomings, we analyze the prevailing Hessian-guided quantization loss, and
uncover certain limitations of conventional Hessian approximations. By
following the block-wise reconstruction framework, we propose a novel PTQ
method for ViTs, dubbed FIMA-Q. Specifically, we firstly establish the
connection between KL divergence and FIM, which enables fast computation of the
quantization loss during reconstruction. We further propose an efficient FIM
approximation method, namely DPLR-FIM, by employing the diagonal plus low-rank
principle, and formulate the ultimate quantization loss. Our extensive
experiments, conducted across various vision tasks with representative
ViT-based architectures on public datasets, demonstrate that our method
substantially promotes the accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art
approaches, especially in the case of low-bit quantization. The source code is

SITS-Extreme, a novel framework that leverages satellite image time series to

experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets validate the
effectiveness of SITS-Extreme, demonstrating substantial improvements over
widely used strong bi-temporal baselines. Additionally, we examine the impact

Result: 在五个公开VQA基准测试中表现优异，性能与可解释性均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: EyeSimVQA为VQA提供了一种高效且可解释的解决方案，未来可进一步探索其生物启发设计。

Abstract: Free-energy-guided self-repair mechanisms have shown promising results in
image quality assessment (IQA), but remain under-explored in video quality
assessment (VQA), where temporal dynamics and model constraints pose unique
challenges. Unlike static images, video content exhibits richer spatiotemporal
complexity, making perceptual restoration more difficult. Moreover, VQA systems
often rely on pre-trained backbones, which limits the direct integration of
enhancement modules without affecting model stability. To address these issues,
we propose EyeSimVQA, a novel VQA framework that incorporates free-energy-based
self-repair. It adopts a dual-branch architecture, with an aesthetic branch for
global perceptual evaluation and a technical branch for fine-grained structural
and semantic analysis. Each branch integrates specialized enhancement modules
tailored to distinct visual inputs-resized full-frame images and patch-based
fragments-to simulate adaptive repair behaviors. We also explore a principled
strategy for incorporating high-level visual features without disrupting the
original backbone. In addition, we design a biologically inspired prediction
head that models sweeping gaze dynamics to better fuse global and local
representations for quality prediction. Experiments on five public VQA
benchmarks demonstrate that EyeSimVQA achieves competitive or superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, while offering improved
interpretability through its biologically grounded design.

Result: 在时间定位和视频问答任务中表现优异，尤其在精确时间对齐和推理任务上超越现有方法。

Conclusion: DaMO为高效数据视频-语言建模提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been extended to the video domain,
enabling sophisticated video-language understanding. However, existing Video
LLMs often exhibit limitations in fine-grained temporal reasoning, restricting
their ability to precisely attribute responses to specific video moments,
especially under constrained supervision. We introduce DaMO, a data-efficient
Video LLM explicitly designed for accurate temporal reasoning and multimodal
understanding. At its core, the proposed Temporal-aware Fuseformer employs a
hierarchical dual-stream architecture that progressively captures temporal
dynamics within each modality and effectively fuses complementary visual and
audio information. To further enhance computational efficiency, DaMO integrates
a global residual that reduces spatial redundancy while preserving essential
semantic details. We train DaMO via a structured four-stage progressive
training paradigm, incrementally equipping the model with multimodal alignment,
semantic grounding, and temporal reasoning capabilities. This work also
contributes multiple datasets augmented from existing ones with GPT-generated
temporally grounded QA pairs for tasks requiring temporal supervision.
Comprehensive experiments on temporal grounding and video QA benchmarks
demonstrate that DaMO consistently surpasses prior methods, particularly in
tasks demanding precise temporal alignment and reasoning. Our work establishes
a promising direction for data-efficient video-language modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MLLMs通过长链思维（CoT）提升复杂问题解决能力，但其有效性原因尚不明确，尤其是视觉线索提取与推理过程的贡献难以量化。

Method: 开发了基于GPT-Image-1的自动编辑流程，精确修改视觉线索；构建VFaith-Bench基准，通过编辑图像生成对比问题对，测试模型视觉推理能力。

Result: VFaith-Bench包含755个条目和人类标注任务，测试主流模型后发现其视觉推理能力与视觉感知的关系。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了MLLMs视觉推理能力的来源，为未来模型优化提供了量化工具和分析方法。

Abstract: Recent extensive works have demonstrated that by introducing long CoT, the
capabilities of MLLMs to solve complex problems can be effectively enhanced.
However, the reasons for the effectiveness of such paradigms remain unclear. It
is challenging to analysis with quantitative results how much the model's
specific extraction of visual cues and its subsequent so-called reasoning
during inference process contribute to the performance improvements. Therefore,
evaluating the faithfulness of MLLMs' reasoning to visual information is
crucial. To address this issue, we first present a cue-driven automatic and
controllable editing pipeline with the help of GPT-Image-1. It enables the
automatic and precise editing of specific visual cues based on the instruction.
Furthermore, we introduce VFaith-Bench, the first benchmark to evaluate MLLMs'
visual reasoning capabilities and analyze the source of such capabilities with
an emphasis on the visual faithfulness. Using the designed pipeline, we
constructed comparative question-answer pairs by altering the visual cues in
images that are crucial for solving the original reasoning problem, thereby
changing the question's answer. By testing similar questions with images that
have different details, the average accuracy reflects the model's visual
reasoning ability, while the difference in accuracy before and after editing
the test set images effectively reveals the relationship between the model's
reasoning ability and visual perception. We further designed specific metrics
to expose this relationship. VFaith-Bench includes 755 entries divided into
five distinct subsets, along with an additional human-labeled perception task.
We conducted in-depth testing and analysis of existing mainstream flagship
models and prominent open-source model series/reasoning models on VFaith-Bench,
further investigating the underlying factors of their reasoning capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有技术难以准确分类抬升轴的车辆，且缺乏商业和技术方法。

Method: 使用YOLOv8s CNN模型，通过垂直于交通方向的摄像头图像检测卡车抬升轴。

Result: 精度87%，召回率91.7%，推理时间1.4毫秒，适合实时应用。

Conclusion: 方法有效，但可通过增加数据集或图像增强进一步优化。

Abstract: The identification and classification of vehicles play a crucial role in
various aspects of the control-sanction system. Current technologies such as
weigh-in-motion (WIM) systems can classify most vehicle categories but they
struggle to accurately classify vehicles with lifted axles. Moreover, very few
commercial and technical methods exist for detecting lifted axles. In this
paper, as part of the European project SETO (Smart Enforcement of Transport
Operations), a method based on a convolutional neural network (CNN), namely
YOLOv8s, was proposed for the detection of lifted truck axles in images of
trucks captured by cameras placed perpendicular to the direction of traffic.
The performance of the proposed method was assessed and it was found that it
had a precision of 87%, a recall of 91.7%, and an inference time of 1.4 ms,
which makes it well-suited for real time implantations. These results suggest
that further improvements could be made, potentially by increasing the size of
the datasets and/or by using various image augmentation methods.

TL;DR: OV-MAP是一种新颖的开放世界3D映射方法，通过将开放特征集成到3D地图中提升物体识别能力，解决了特征溢出导致的精度问题。


<details>

Motivation: 解决3D映射中因特征溢出到相邻体素而降低实例级精度的问题。

Method: 使用类别无关的分割模型将2D掩模投影到3D空间，结合原始和合成深度图像，并采用3D掩模投票机制。

Result: 在ScanNet200和Replica数据集上表现出优越的零样本性能、鲁棒性和适应性。

Conclusion: OV-MAP方法在无需3D监督分割模型的情况下，实现了准确的零样本3D实例分割，适用于多样化环境。

Abstract: We introduce OV-MAP, a novel approach to open-world 3D mapping for mobile
robots by integrating open-features into 3D maps to enhance object recognition
capabilities. A significant challenge arises when overlapping features from
adjacent voxels reduce instance-level precision, as features spill over voxel
boundaries, blending neighboring regions together. Our method overcomes this by
employing a class-agnostic segmentation model to project 2D masks into 3D
space, combined with a supplemented depth image created by merging raw and
synthetic depth from point clouds. This approach, along with a 3D mask voting
mechanism, enables accurate zero-shot 3D instance segmentation without relying
on 3D supervised segmentation models. We assess the effectiveness of our method
through comprehensive experiments on public datasets such as ScanNet200 and
Replica, demonstrating superior zero-shot performance, robustness, and
adaptability across diverse environments. Additionally, we conducted real-world
experiments to demonstrate our method's adaptability and robustness when
applied to diverse real-world environments.

Result: 评估了当前最先进的视觉语言模型，并分析了其失败模式。

Conclusion: EasyARC为视觉语言模型的真实推理和测试时扩展能力设定了新标准，并开源了数据集和评估代码。

Abstract: Building on recent advances in language-based reasoning models, we explore
multimodal reasoning that integrates vision and text. Existing multimodal
benchmarks primarily test visual extraction combined with text-based reasoning,
lacking true visual reasoning with more complex interactions between vision and
language. Inspired by the ARC challenge, we introduce EasyARC, a
vision-language benchmark requiring multi-image, multi-step reasoning, and
self-correction. EasyARC is procedurally generated, fully verifiable, and
scalable, making it ideal for reinforcement learning (RL) pipelines. The
generators incorporate progressive difficulty levels, enabling structured
evaluation across task types and complexities. We benchmark state-of-the-art
vision-language models and analyze their failure modes. We argue that EasyARC
sets a new standard for evaluating true reasoning and test-time scaling
capabilities in vision-language models. We open-source our benchmark dataset
and evaluation code.

Motivation: 解决语义分割中手动像素级标注成本高且易出错的问题，通过选择性校正错误标签。

Method: 结合自动化校正阶段和自适应平衡获取函数，利用标注者反馈扩展校正范围，并优化尾类样本的校正。

Result: 在Cityscapes和PASCAL VOC 2012数据集上表现优异，仅用20%预算即超越现有方法，性能提升27.23%。

Conclusion: A²LC框架高效且有效，显著提升了标签校正的性价比。

Abstract: Active Label Correction (ALC) has emerged as a promising solution to the high
cost and error-prone nature of manual pixel-wise annotation in semantic
segmentation, by selectively identifying and correcting mislabeled data.
Although recent work has improved correction efficiency by generating
pseudo-labels using foundation models, substantial inefficiencies still remain.
In this paper, we propose Active and Automated Label Correction for semantic
segmentation (A$^2$LC), a novel and efficient ALC framework that integrates an
automated correction stage into the conventional pipeline. Specifically, the
automated correction stage leverages annotator feedback to perform label
correction beyond the queried samples, thereby maximizing cost efficiency. In
addition, we further introduce an adaptively balanced acquisition function that
emphasizes underrepresented tail classes and complements the automated
correction mechanism. Extensive experiments on Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC 2012
demonstrate that A$^2$LC significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art
methods. Notably, A$^2$LC achieves high efficiency by outperforming previous
methods using only 20% of their budget, and demonstrates strong effectiveness
by yielding a 27.23% performance improvement under an equivalent budget
constraint on the Cityscapes dataset. The code will be released upon
acceptance.

Conclusion: 多模态协作感知方法显著提升了行为识别的准确性。

Abstract: WiFi-based human behavior recognition aims to recognize gestures and
activities by analyzing wireless signal variations. However, existing methods
typically focus on a single type of data, neglecting the interaction and fusion
of multiple features. To this end, we propose a novel multimodal collaborative
awareness method. By leveraging phase data reflecting changes in dynamic path
length and Doppler Shift (DFS) data corresponding to frequency changes related
to the speed of gesture movement, we enable efficient interaction and fusion of
these features to improve recognition accuracy. Specifically, we first
introduce a dual-branch self-attention module to capture spatial-temporal cues
within each modality. Then, a group attention mechanism is applied to the
concatenated phase and DFS features to mine key group features critical for
behavior recognition. Through a gating mechanism, the combined features are
further divided into PD-strengthen and PD-weaken branches, optimizing
information entropy and promoting cross-modal collaborative awareness.
Extensive in-domain and cross-domain experiments on two large publicly
available datasets, Widar3.0 and XRF55, demonstrate the superior performance of
our method.

Result: 实验表明，SignAligner显著提高了生成手语视频的准确性和表现力。

Conclusion: SignAligner通过多阶段方法成功解决了手语生成的复杂性问题，为逼真手语视频生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Sign language generation aims to produce diverse sign representations based
on spoken language. However, achieving realistic and naturalistic generation
remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of sign language, which
encompasses intricate hand gestures, facial expressions, and body movements. In
this work, we introduce PHOENIX14T+, an extended version of the widely-used
RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather 2014T dataset, featuring three new sign representations:
Pose, Hamer and Smplerx. We also propose a novel method, SignAligner, for
realistic sign language generation, consisting of three stages: text-driven
pose modalities co-generation, online collaborative correction of
multimodality, and realistic sign video synthesis. First, by incorporating text
semantics, we design a joint sign language generator to simultaneously produce
posture coordinates, gesture actions, and body movements. The text encoder,
based on a Transformer architecture, extracts semantic features, while a
cross-modal attention mechanism integrates these features to generate diverse
sign language representations, ensuring accurate mapping and controlling the
diversity of modal features. Next, online collaborative correction is
introduced to refine the generated pose modalities using a dynamic loss
weighting strategy and cross-modal attention, facilitating the complementarity
of information across modalities, eliminating spatiotemporal conflicts, and
ensuring semantic coherence and action consistency. Finally, the corrected pose
modalities are fed into a pre-trained video generation network to produce
high-fidelity sign language videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SignAligner significantly improves both the accuracy and expressiveness of the
generated sign videos.

Result: 新方法能够捕捉传统分类方法无法处理的细粒度公平性差异，并提供更公平的肤色处理。

Conclusion: 该方法为肤色相关的ML公平性评估提供了更灵活和准确的解决方案，有助于推动可信AI的发展。

Abstract: Fairness is a critical component of Trustworthy AI. In this paper, we focus
on Machine Learning (ML) and the performance of model predictions when dealing
with skin color. Unlike other sensitive attributes, the nature of skin color
differs significantly. In computer vision, skin color is represented as tensor
data rather than categorical values or single numerical points. However, much
of the research on fairness across sensitive groups has focused on categorical
features such as gender and race. This paper introduces a new technique for
evaluating fairness in ML for image classification tasks, specifically without
the use of annotation. To address the limitations of prior work, we handle
tensor data, like skin color, without classifying it rigidly. Instead, we
convert it into probability distributions and apply statistical distance
measures. This novel approach allows us to capture fine-grained nuances in
fairness both within and across what would traditionally be considered distinct
groups. Additionally, we propose an innovative training method to mitigate the
latent biases present in conventional skin tone categorization. This method
leverages color distance estimates calculated through Bayesian regression with
polynomial functions, ensuring a more nuanced and equitable treatment of skin
color in ML models.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种标准反因果预测模型（SAM）和正则化策略DISCO，用于解决预测任务中模型依赖无关信号的问题，并通过实验验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测任务中，模型可能利用无关信号（如光照条件）作为捷径，导致预测结果不理想。需要一种方法确保模型仅关注因果相关的信号。

Method: 引入SAM模型建立因果框架，提出DISCO正则化策略，利用条件距离相关性优化回归任务中的条件独立性。

Result: DISCO在不同偏差缓解实验中表现优异，成为传统核方法的有效替代。

Conclusion: SAM和DISCO为反因果预测提供了有效解决方案，确保模型仅依赖因果相关信号。

Abstract: During prediction tasks, models can use any signal they receive to come up
with the final answer - including signals that are causally irrelevant. When
predicting objects from images, for example, the lighting conditions could be
correlated to different targets through selection bias, and an oblivious model
might use these signals as shortcuts to discern between various objects. A
predictor that uses lighting conditions instead of real object-specific details
is obviously undesirable. To address this challenge, we introduce a standard
anti-causal prediction model (SAM) that creates a causal framework for
analyzing the information pathways influencing our predictor in anti-causal
settings. We demonstrate that a classifier satisfying a specific conditional
independence criterion will focus solely on the direct causal path from label
to image, being counterfactually invariant to the remaining variables. Finally,
we propose DISCO, a novel regularization strategy that uses conditional
distance correlation to optimize for conditional independence in regression
tasks. We can show that DISCO achieves competitive results in different bias
mitigation experiments, deeming it a valid alternative to classical
kernel-based methods.

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了X射线图像中违禁物品的遮挡问题，数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: Instance segmentation of prohibited items in security X-ray images is a
critical yet challenging task. This is mainly caused by the significant
appearance gap between prohibited items in X-ray images and natural objects, as
well as the severe overlapping among objects in X-ray images. To address these
issues, we propose an occlusion-aware instance segmentation pipeline designed
to identify prohibited items in X-ray images. Specifically, to bridge the
representation gap, we integrate the Segment Anything Model (SAM) into our
pipeline, taking advantage of its rich priors and zero-shot generalization
capabilities. To address the overlap between prohibited items, we design an
occlusion-aware bilayer mask decoder module that explicitly models the
occlusion relationships. To supervise occlusion estimation, we manually
annotated occlusion areas of prohibited items in two large-scale X-ray image
segmentation datasets, PIDray and PIXray. We then reorganized these additional
annotations together with the original information as two occlusion-annotated
datasets, PIDray-A and PIXray-A. Extensive experimental results on these
occlusion-annotated datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
method. The datasets and codes are available at: https://github.com/Ryh1218/Occ

Result: 实验表明D-MoLE显著优于现有基线，平均提升15%。

Conclusion: 首次从架构角度研究MLLM的持续学习，D-MoLE方法有效解决了任务适应问题。

Abstract: Continual multimodal instruction tuning is crucial for adapting Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) to evolving tasks. However, most existing methods
adopt a fixed architecture, struggling with adapting to new tasks due to static
model capacity. We propose to evolve the architecture under parameter budgets
for dynamic task adaptation, which remains unexplored and imposes two
challenges: 1) task architecture conflict, where different tasks require
varying layer-wise adaptations, and 2) modality imbalance, where different
tasks rely unevenly on modalities, leading to unbalanced updates. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel Dynamic Mixture of Curriculum LoRA Experts
(D-MoLE) method, which automatically evolves MLLM's architecture with
controlled parameter budgets to continually adapt to new tasks while retaining
previously learned knowledge. Specifically, we propose a dynamic layer-wise
expert allocator, which automatically allocates LoRA experts across layers to
resolve architecture conflicts, and routes instructions layer-wisely to
facilitate knowledge sharing among experts. Then, we propose a gradient-based
inter-modal continual curriculum, which adjusts the update ratio of each module
in MLLM based on the difficulty of each modality within the task to alleviate
the modality imbalance problem. Extensive experiments show that D-MoLE
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a 15% average
improvement over the best baseline. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first study of continual learning for MLLMs from an architectural perspective.

Motivation: 现有模型在负样本选择、局部细节提取和低层次特征利用方面存在不足，影响了医学图像识别的准确性。

Method: 1）通过跨模态注意力扩展k均值聚类到多模态领域，改进负样本选择；2）引入跨模态掩码图像重建模块，增强跨模态信息交互和低层次特征保留。

Result: 在五个下游数据集的分类、检测和分割任务中，CM-CGNS在多项指标上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CM-CGNS能学习到有效且鲁棒的医学视觉表示，适用于多种识别任务。

Abstract: Learning medical visual representations directly from paired images and
reports through multimodal self-supervised learning has emerged as a novel and
efficient approach to digital diagnosis in recent years. However, existing
models suffer from several severe limitations. 1) neglecting the selection of
negative samples, resulting in the scarcity of hard negatives and the inclusion
of false negatives; 2) focusing on global feature extraction, but overlooking
the fine-grained local details that are crucial for medical image recognition
tasks; and 3) contrastive learning primarily targets high-level features but
ignoring low-level details which are essential for accurate medical analysis.
Motivated by these critical issues, this paper presents a Cross-Modal
Cluster-Guided Negative Sampling (CM-CGNS) method with two-fold ideas. First,
it extends the k-means clustering used for local text features in the
single-modal domain to the multimodal domain through cross-modal attention.
This improvement increases the number of negative samples and boosts the model
representation capability. Second, it introduces a Cross-Modal Masked Image
Reconstruction (CM-MIR) module that leverages local text-to-image features
obtained via cross-modal attention to reconstruct masked local image regions.
This module significantly strengthens the model's cross-modal information
interaction capabilities and retains low-level image features essential for
downstream tasks. By well handling the aforementioned limitations, the proposed
CM-CGNS can learn effective and robust medical visual representations suitable
for various recognition tasks. Extensive experimental results on
classification, detection, and segmentation tasks across five downstream
datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on
multiple metrics, verifying its superior performance.

Abstract: The primary objective of the AIIB 2023 competition is to evaluate the
predictive significance of airway-related imaging biomarkers in determining the
survival outcomes of patients with lung fibrosis.This study introduces a
comprehensive three-stage approach. Initially, a segmentation network, namely
nn-Unet, is employed to delineate the airway's structural boundaries.
Subsequently, key features are extracted from the radiomic images centered
around the trachea and an enclosing bounding box around the airway. This step
is motivated by the potential presence of critical survival-related insights
within the tracheal region as well as pertinent information encoded in the
structure and dimensions of the airway. Lastly, radiomic features obtained from
the segmented areas are integrated into an SVM classifier. We could obtain an
overall-score of 0.8601 for the segmentation in Task 1 while 0.7346 for the
classification in Task 2.

Result: ViT的测试准确率达90%，显著优于其他模型（卷积网络35%，CLIP模型62-64%），且差异具有统计学意义。可解释性分析显示ViT更关注动作相关区域。

Conclusion: Transformer在数据效率和性能上优于传统模型，可解释性工具有助于诊断模型失败原因。

Abstract: This study explores human action recognition using a three-class subset of
the COCO image corpus, benchmarking models from simple fully connected networks
to transformer architectures. The binary Vision Transformer (ViT) achieved 90%
mean test accuracy, significantly exceeding multiclass classifiers such as
convolutional networks (approximately 35%) and CLIP-based models (approximately
62-64%). A one-way ANOVA (F = 61.37, p < 0.001) confirmed these differences are
statistically significant. Qualitative analysis with SHAP explainer and LeGrad
heatmaps indicated that the ViT localizes pose-specific regions (e.g., lower
limbs for walking or running), while simpler feed-forward models often focus on
background textures, explaining their errors. These findings emphasize the data
efficiency of transformer representations and the importance of explainability
techniques in diagnosing class-specific failures.

Conclusion: MTabVQA填补了多表格视觉推理的空白，微调方法有效提升了模型能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
interpreting visual layouts and text. However, a significant challenge remains
in their ability to interpret robustly and reason over multi-tabular data
presented as images, a common occurrence in real-world scenarios like web pages
and digital documents. Existing benchmarks typically address single tables or
non-visual data (text/structured). This leaves a critical gap: they don't
assess the ability to parse diverse table images, correlate information across
them, and perform multi-hop reasoning on the combined visual data. We introduce
MTabVQA, a novel benchmark specifically designed for multi-tabular visual
question answering to bridge that gap. MTabVQA comprises 3,745 complex
question-answer pairs that necessitate multi-hop reasoning across several
visually rendered table images. We provide extensive benchmark results for
state-of-the-art VLMs on MTabVQA, revealing significant performance
limitations. We further investigate post-training techniques to enhance these
reasoning abilities and release MTabVQA-Instruct, a large-scale
instruction-tuning dataset. Our experiments show that fine-tuning VLMs with
MTabVQA-Instruct substantially improves their performance on visual
multi-tabular reasoning. Code and dataset

Result: 在BraTS2020和MyoPS2020数据集上，DMAF-Net优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DMAF-Net通过动态平衡模态贡献和结构关系，显著提升了不完全多模态医学图像分割的性能。

Abstract: Incomplete multi-modal medical image segmentation faces critical challenges
from modality imbalance, including imbalanced modality missing rates and
heterogeneous modality contributions. Due to their reliance on idealized
assumptions of complete modality availability, existing methods fail to
dynamically balance contributions and neglect the structural relationships
between modalities, resulting in suboptimal performance in real-world clinical
scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novel model, named
Dynamic Modality-Aware Fusion Network (DMAF-Net). The DMAF-Net adopts three key
ideas. First, it introduces a Dynamic Modality-Aware Fusion (DMAF) module to
suppress missing-modality interference by combining transformer attention with
adaptive masking and weight modality contributions dynamically through
attention maps. Second, it designs a synergistic Relation Distillation and
Prototype Distillation framework to enforce global-local feature alignment via

TL;DR: DiffFuSR是一个模块化管道，用于将Sentinel-2 Level-2A影像的12个光谱波段超分辨率统一到2.5米的地面采样距离（GSD）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Sentinel-2影像多光谱波段分辨率不一致的问题，提升影像质量。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：1）基于扩散模型的超分辨率（SR）模型；2）融合网络，利用超分辨率RGB图像作为空间先验。

Result: 在OpenSR基准测试中表现优于现有方法，反射率保真度、光谱一致性、空间对齐和幻觉抑制均有所提升。

Conclusion: 通过生成先验和融合策略，实现了模块化的Sentinel-2超分辨率框架。

Abstract: This paper presents DiffFuSR, a modular pipeline for super-resolving all 12
spectral bands of Sentinel-2 Level-2A imagery to a unified ground sampling
distance (GSD) of 2.5 meters. The pipeline comprises two stages: (i) a
diffusion-based super-resolution (SR) model trained on high-resolution RGB
imagery from the NAIP and WorldStrat datasets, harmonized to simulate
Sentinel-2 characteristics; and (ii) a learned fusion network that upscales the
remaining multispectral bands using the super-resolved RGB image as a spatial
prior. We introduce a robust degradation model and contrastive degradation
encoder to support blind SR. Extensive evaluations of the proposed SR pipeline
on the OpenSR benchmark demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
current SOTA baselines in terms of reflectance fidelity, spectral consistency,
spatial alignment, and hallucination suppression. Furthermore, the fusion
network significantly outperforms classical pansharpening approaches, enabling
accurate enhancement of Sentinel-2's 20 m and 60 m bands. This study
underscores the power of harmonized learning with generative priors and fusion
strategies to create a modular framework for Sentinel-2 SR. Our code and models

TL;DR: MambaVSR提出了一种基于状态空间模型的视频超分辨率框架，通过动态时空交互和内容感知机制，解决了传统方法在大运动位移和长视频序列中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频超分辨率（VSR）在建模非局部依赖性和保持计算效率方面面临挑战，传统方法（如光流或Transformer）难以处理大运动位移和长序列。

Method: MambaVSR引入内容感知扫描机制，包括Shared Compass Construction（SCC）和Content-Aware Sequentialization（CAS）模块，结合Global-Local State Space Block（GLSSB）实现全局与局部特征的协同。

Result: 在REDS数据集上，MambaVSR比基于Transformer的方法PSNR提高了0.58 dB，且参数减少了55%。

Conclusion: MambaVSR通过创新的状态空间模型和动态扫描机制，显著提升了视频超分辨率的性能，同时保持了计算效率。

Abstract: Video super-resolution (VSR) faces critical challenges in effectively
modeling non-local dependencies across misaligned frames while preserving
computational efficiency. Existing VSR methods typically rely on optical flow
strategies or transformer architectures, which struggle with large motion
displacements and long video sequences. To address this, we propose MambaVSR,
the first state-space model framework for VSR that incorporates an innovative
content-aware scanning mechanism. Unlike rigid 1D sequential processing in
conventional vision Mamba methods, our MambaVSR enables dynamic spatiotemporal
interactions through the Shared Compass Construction (SCC) and the
Content-Aware Sequentialization (CAS). Specifically, the SCC module constructs
intra-frame semantic connectivity graphs via efficient sparse attention and
generates adaptive spatial scanning sequences through spectral clustering.
Building upon SCC, the CAS module effectively aligns and aggregates non-local
similar content across multiple frames by interleaving temporal features along
the learned spatial order. To bridge global dependencies with local details,
the Global-Local State Space Block (GLSSB) synergistically integrates window
self-attention operations with SSM-based feature propagation, enabling
high-frequency detail recovery under global dependency guidance. Extensive
experiments validate MambaVSR's superiority, outperforming the
Transformer-based method by 0.58 dB PSNR on the REDS dataset with 55% fewer
parameters.

TL;DR: CLIPFUSION结合判别式和生成式基础模型，通过多模态融合解决异常检测中的复杂问题，显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异常检测因定义模糊、类型多样及数据稀缺而复杂，需综合模型捕捉多层次特征。

Method: CLIPFUSION结合CLIP判别模型（全局特征）和扩散生成模型（局部细节），利用交叉注意力图和特征图进行异常检测。

Result: 在MVTec-AD和VisA数据集上，CLIPFUSION在异常分割和分类中表现优异。

Conclusion: 多模态和多模型融合有效应对异常检测的复杂挑战，为实际应用提供可扩展方案。

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a complex problem due to the ambiguity in defining
anomalies, the diversity of anomaly types (e.g., local and global defect), and
the scarcity of training data. As such, it necessitates a comprehensive model
capable of capturing both low-level and high-level features, even with limited
data. To address this, we propose CLIPFUSION, a method that leverages both
discriminative and generative foundation models. Specifically, the CLIP-based
discriminative model excels at capturing global features, while the
diffusion-based generative model effectively captures local details, creating a
synergistic and complementary approach. Notably, we introduce a methodology for
utilizing cross-attention maps and feature maps extracted from diffusion models
specifically for anomaly detection. Experimental results on benchmark datasets
(MVTec-AD, VisA) demonstrate that CLIPFUSION consistently outperforms baseline
methods, achieving outstanding performance in both anomaly segmentation and
classification. We believe that our method underscores the effectiveness of
multi-modal and multi-model fusion in tackling the multifaceted challenges of
anomaly detection, providing a scalable solution for real-world applications.

TL;DR: AgentSense利用大型语言模型生成虚拟数据，解决智能家居中人类活动识别（HAR）系统缺乏多样化标注数据的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能家居HAR系统因缺乏大规模、多样化标注数据而难以泛化，用户行为和家庭布局的多样性增加了复杂性。

Method: 通过虚拟数据生成管道AgentSense，生成多样化人物角色及其日常行为，并在模拟家庭环境中记录传感器数据。

Result: 实验表明，结合虚拟数据和少量真实数据训练的模型性能接近完全使用真实数据的模型。

Conclusion: 虚拟数据能有效解决HAR领域缺乏大规模标注数据的问题，无需手动收集数据。

Abstract: A major obstacle in developing robust and generalizable smart home-based
Human Activity Recognition (HAR) systems is the lack of large-scale, diverse
labeled datasets. Variability in home layouts, sensor configurations, and user
behavior adds further complexity, as individuals follow varied routines and
perform activities in distinct ways. Building HAR systems that generalize well
requires training data that captures the diversity across users and
environments. To address these challenges, we introduce AgentSense, a virtual
data generation pipeline where diverse personas are generated by leveraging
Large Language Models. These personas are used to create daily routines, which
are then decomposed into low-level action sequences. Subsequently, the actions
are executed in a simulated home environment called VirtualHome that we
extended with virtual ambient sensors capable of recording the agents
activities as they unfold. Overall, AgentSense enables the generation of rich,
virtual sensor datasets that represent a wide range of users and home settings.
Across five benchmark HAR datasets, we show that leveraging our virtual sensor
data substantially improves performance, particularly when real data are
limited. Notably, models trained on a combination of virtual data and just a
few days of real data achieve performance comparable to those trained on the
entire real datasets. These results demonstrate and prove the potential of
virtual data to address one of the most pressing challenges in ambient sensing,
which is the distinct lack of large-scale, annotated datasets without requiring
any manual data collection efforts.

Abstract: Isometric exercises appeal to individuals seeking convenience, privacy, and
minimal dependence on equipments. However, such fitness training is often
overdependent on unreliable digital media content instead of expert
supervision, introducing serious risks, including incorrect posture, injury,
and disengagement due to lack of corrective feedback. To address these
challenges, we present a real-time feedback system for assessing isometric
poses. Our contributions include the release of the largest multiclass
isometric exercise video dataset to date, comprising over 3,600 clips across
six poses with correct and incorrect variations. To support robust evaluation,
we benchmark state-of-the-art models-including graph-based networks-on this
dataset and introduce a novel three-part metric that captures classification
accuracy, mistake localization, and model confidence. Our results enhance the
feasibility of intelligent and personalized exercise training systems for home
workouts. This expert-level diagnosis, delivered directly to the users, also
expands the potential applications of these systems to rehabilitation,
physiotherapy, and various other fitness disciplines that involve physical
motion.

Motivation: 心脏超声领域缺乏特定预训练模型，现有自监督方法难以处理高样本相似性和低PSNR输入等问题。

Result: 在六个超声数据集上，DISCOVR在零样本和线性探测中优于现有方法，并实现更好的分割迁移。

Conclusion: DISCOVR通过双分支设计和知识蒸馏，显著提升了心脏超声视频的表示学习效果。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has achieved major advances in natural images
and video understanding, but challenges remain in domains like echocardiography
(heart ultrasound) due to subtle anatomical structures, complex temporal
dynamics, and the current lack of domain-specific pre-trained models. Existing
SSL approaches such as contrastive, masked modeling, and clustering-based
methods struggle with high intersample similarity, sensitivity to low PSNR
inputs common in ultrasound, or aggressive augmentations that distort
clinically relevant features. We present DISCOVR (Distilled Image Supervision
for Cross Modal Video Representation), a self-supervised dual branch framework
for cardiac ultrasound video representation learning. DISCOVR combines a
clustering-based video encoder that models temporal dynamics with an online
image encoder that extracts fine-grained spatial semantics. These branches are
connected through a semantic cluster distillation loss that transfers
anatomical knowledge from the evolving image encoder to the video encoder,
enabling temporally coherent representations enriched with fine-grained
semantic understanding. Evaluated on six echocardiography datasets spanning
fetal, pediatric, and adult populations, DISCOVR outperforms both specialized
video anomaly detection methods and state-of-the-art video-SSL baselines in
zero-shot and linear probing setups, and achieves superior segmentation
transfer.

TL;DR: GPLQ是一种高效、实用的ViT量化框架，通过两阶段策略（激活优先、权重后量化）显著提升性能，速度快100倍，内存占用低，且保持高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PTQ和QAT方法在ViT量化中存在精度下降、计算成本高、泛化能力差等问题，亟需一种高效且通用的解决方案。

Method: GPLQ采用两阶段策略：阶段1量化激活并保持权重为FP32，阶段2量化权重。通过特征模仿损失和保留优化“basin”来维持泛化能力。

Result: GPLQ速度快100倍，内存占用低于FP32训练，4-bit量化模型在ImageNet和下游任务中性能接近FP32模型。

Conclusion: GPLQ为ViT量化提供了一种高效、通用的解决方案，显著优于现有方法，并支持多种视觉任务的开源工具包。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) are essential in computer vision but are
computationally intensive, too. Model quantization, particularly to low
bit-widths like 4-bit, aims to alleviate this difficulty, yet existing
Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) and Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) methods
exhibit significant limitations. PTQ often incurs substantial accuracy drop,
while QAT achieves high accuracy but suffers from prohibitive computational
costs, limited generalization to downstream tasks, training instability, and
lacking of open-source codebase. To address these challenges, this paper
introduces General, Practical, and Lightning Quantization (GPLQ), a novel
framework designed for efficient and effective ViT quantization. GPLQ is
founded on two key empirical insights: the paramount importance of activation
quantization and the necessity of preserving the model's original optimization
``basin'' to maintain generalization. Consequently, GPLQ employs a sequential
``activation-first, weights-later'' strategy. Stage 1 keeps weights in FP32
while quantizing activations with a feature mimicking loss in only 1 epoch to
keep it stay in the same ``basin'', thereby preserving generalization. Stage 2
quantizes weights using a PTQ method. As a result, GPLQ is 100x faster than
existing QAT methods, lowers memory footprint to levels even below FP32
training, and achieves 4-bit model performance that is highly competitive with
FP32 models in terms of both accuracy on ImageNet and generalization to diverse
downstream tasks, including fine-grained visual classification and object
detection. We will release an easy-to-use open-source toolkit supporting
multiple vision tasks.

Abstract: In recent years, the development of interconnected devices has expanded in
many fields, from infotainment to education and industrial applications. This
trend has been accelerated by the increased number of sensors and accessibility
to powerful hardware and software. One area that significantly benefits from
these advancements is Teleoperated Driving (TD). In this scenario, a controller
drives safely a vehicle from remote leveraging sensors data generated onboard
the vehicle, and exchanged via Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications. In
this work, we tackle the problem of detecting the presence of cars and
pedestrians from point cloud data to enable safe TD operations. More
specifically, we exploit the SELMA dataset, a multimodal, open-source,
synthetic dataset for autonomous driving, that we expanded by including the
ground-truth bounding boxes of 3D objects to support object detection. We
analyze the performance of state-of-the-art compression algorithms and object
detectors under several metrics, including compression efficiency,
(de)compression and inference time, and detection accuracy. Moreover, we
measure the impact of compression and detection on the V2X network in terms of
data rate and latency with respect to 3GPP requirements for TD applications.

Conclusion: 建立了新的VLT评估基准，并提出了改进模型性能的策略。

Abstract: Vision-Language Translation (VLT) is a challenging task that requires
accurately recognizing multilingual text embedded in images and translating it
into the target language with the support of visual context. While recent Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated strong multilingual and visual
understanding capabilities, there is a lack of systematic evaluation and
understanding of their performance on VLT. In this work, we present a
comprehensive study of VLT from three key perspectives: data quality, model
architecture, and evaluation metrics. (1) We identify critical limitations in
existing datasets, particularly in semantic and cultural fidelity, and
introduce AibTrans -- a multilingual, parallel, human-verified dataset with
OCR-corrected annotations. (2) We benchmark 11 commercial LVLMs/LLMs and 6
state-of-the-art open-source models across end-to-end and cascaded
architectures, revealing their OCR dependency and contrasting generation versus
reasoning behaviors. (3) We propose Density-Aware Evaluation to address metric
reliability issues under varying contextual complexity, introducing the DA
Score as a more robust measure of translation quality. Building upon these
findings, we establish a new evaluation benchmark for VLT. Notably, we observe
that fine-tuning LVLMs on high-resource language pairs degrades cross-lingual
performance, and we propose a balanced multilingual fine-tuning strategy that
effectively adapts LVLMs to VLT without sacrificing their generalization
ability.

Abstract: Image-based 3D object detection is an inevitable part of autonomous driving
because cheap onboard cameras are already available in most modern cars.
Because of the accurate depth information, currently, most state-of-the-art 3D
object detectors heavily rely on LiDAR data. In this paper, we propose a
pipeline which lifts the results of existing vision-based 2D algorithms to 3D
detections using only cameras as a cost-effective alternative to LiDAR. In
contrast to existing approaches, we focus not only on cars but on all types of
road users. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first using a 2D CNN to
process the point cloud for each 2D detection to keep the computational effort
as low as possible. Our evaluation on the challenging KITTI 3D object detection
benchmark shows results comparable to state-of-the-art image-based approaches
while having a runtime of only a third.

Conclusion: SphereDrag通过球形几何知识实现了准确可控的全景图像编辑，并构建了PanoBench作为标准化评估框架。

Abstract: Image editing has made great progress on planar images, but panoramic image
editing remains underexplored. Due to their spherical geometry and projection
distortions, panoramic images present three key challenges: boundary
discontinuity, trajectory deformation, and uneven pixel density. To tackle
these issues, we propose SphereDrag, a novel panoramic editing framework
utilizing spherical geometry knowledge for accurate and controllable editing.
Specifically, adaptive reprojection (AR) uses adaptive spherical rotation to
deal with discontinuity; great-circle trajectory adjustment (GCTA) tracks the
movement trajectory more accurate; spherical search region tracking (SSRT)
adaptively scales the search range based on spherical location to address
uneven pixel density. Also, we construct PanoBench, a panoramic editing
benchmark, including complex editing tasks involving multiple objects and
diverse styles, which provides a standardized evaluation framework. Experiments
show that SphereDrag gains a considerable improvement compared with existing
methods in geometric consistency and image quality, achieving up to 10.5%
relative improvement.

Abstract: Instance segmentation of ships in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery is
critical for applications such as maritime monitoring, environmental analysis,
and national security. SAR ship images present challenges including scale
variation, object density, and fuzzy target boundary, which are often
overlooked in existing methods, leading to suboptimal performance. In this
work, we propose O2Former, a tailored instance segmentation framework that
extends Mask2Former by fully leveraging the structural characteristics of SAR
imagery. We introduce two key components. The first is the Optimized Query
Generator(OQG). It enables multi-scale feature interaction by jointly encoding
shallow positional cues and high-level semantic information. This improves
query quality and convergence efficiency. The second component is the
Orientation-Aware Embedding Module(OAEM). It enhances directional sensitivity
through direction-aware convolution and polar-coordinate encoding. This
effectively addresses the challenge of uneven target orientations in SAR
scenes. Together, these modules facilitate precise feature alignment from
backbone to decoder and strengthen the model's capacity to capture fine-grained
structural details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that O2Former outperforms
state of the art instance segmentation baselines, validating its effectiveness

Abstract: We introduce a diffusion-based framework that performs aligned novel view
image and geometry generation via a warping-and-inpainting methodology. Unlike
prior methods that require dense posed images or pose-embedded generative
models limited to in-domain views, our method leverages off-the-shelf geometry
predictors to predict partial geometries viewed from reference images, and
formulates novel-view synthesis as an inpainting task for both image and
geometry. To ensure accurate alignment between generated images and geometry,
we propose cross-modal attention distillation, where attention maps from the
image diffusion branch are injected into a parallel geometry diffusion branch
during both training and inference. This multi-task approach achieves
synergistic effects, facilitating geometrically robust image synthesis as well
as well-defined geometry prediction. We further introduce proximity-based mesh
conditioning to integrate depth and normal cues, interpolating between point
cloud and filtering erroneously predicted geometry from influencing the

extrapolative view synthesis on both image and geometry across a range of

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究比较了基于智能手机的深度学习眼动追踪算法与商用红外眼动追踪器Tobii Pro Nano的性能，探讨了在移动使用条件下基于外观的注视估计的可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在评估基于外观的注视估计在现实移动使用条件下的可行性，并分析关键敏感性因素。

Method: 采用轻量级卷积神经网络（MobileNet-V3）与循环结构（LSTM）结合的方法，从灰度面部图像预测注视坐标。

Result: 深度学习模型的平均误差为17.76 mm，略高于Tobii Pro Nano的16.53 mm，但对光照、视力矫正和年龄等因素更敏感。

Conclusion: 基于外观的方法在移动眼动追踪中具有潜力，并提供了评估注视估计系统的参考框架。

Abstract: This study evaluates a smartphone-based, deep-learning eye-tracking algorithm
by comparing its performance against a commercial infrared-based eye tracker,
the Tobii Pro Nano. The aim is to investigate the feasibility of
appearance-based gaze estimation under realistic mobile usage conditions. Key
sensitivity factors, including age, gender, vision correction, lighting
conditions, device type, and head position, were systematically analysed. The
appearance-based algorithm integrates a lightweight convolutional neural
network (MobileNet-V3) with a recurrent structure (Long Short-Term Memory) to
predict gaze coordinates from grayscale facial images. Gaze data were collected
from 51 participants using dynamic visual stimuli, and accuracy was measured
using Euclidean distance. The deep learning model produced a mean error of
17.76 mm, compared to 16.53 mm for the Tobii Pro Nano. While overall accuracy
differences were small, the deep learning-based method was more sensitive to
factors such as lighting, vision correction, and age, with higher failure rates
observed under low-light conditions among participants using glasses and in
older age groups. Device-specific and positional factors also influenced
tracking performance. These results highlight the potential of appearance-based
approaches for mobile eye tracking and offer a reference framework for
evaluating gaze estimation systems across varied usage conditions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过线性适配器连接冻结的视觉和语言模型的方法，研究了视觉与语言表征的对齐机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解视觉语言模型（VLMs）如何实现视觉与语言表征的对齐，目前机制尚不明确。

Method: 使用冻结的大型语言模型（LLM）和视觉变换器（ViT），仅通过训练线性适配器进行视觉指令调整。

Result: 分析表明，视觉表征与语言表征在中间至后期层逐渐对齐，早期层存在不匹配。

Conclusion: 当前基于适配器的架构可能未最优支持跨模态表征学习，需进一步研究。

Abstract: Effective multimodal reasoning depends on the alignment of visual and
linguistic representations, yet the mechanisms by which vision-language models
(VLMs) achieve this alignment remain poorly understood. We introduce a
methodological framework that deliberately maintains a frozen large language
model (LLM) and a frozen vision transformer (ViT), connected solely by training
a linear adapter during visual instruction tuning. This design is fundamental
to our approach: by keeping the language model frozen, we ensure it maintains
its original language representations without adaptation to visual data.
Consequently, the linear adapter must map visual features directly into the
LLM's existing representational space rather than allowing the language model
to develop specialized visual understanding through fine-tuning. Our
experimental design uniquely enables the use of pre-trained sparse autoencoders
(SAEs) of the LLM as analytical probes. These SAEs remain perfectly aligned
with the unchanged language model and serve as a snapshot of the learned
language feature-representations. Through systematic analysis of SAE
reconstruction error, sparsity patterns, and feature SAE descriptions, we
reveal the layer-wise progression through which visual representations
gradually align with language feature representations, converging in
middle-to-later layers. This suggests a fundamental misalignment between ViT
outputs and early LLM layers, raising important questions about whether current
adapter-based architectures optimally facilitate cross-modal representation
learning.

Motivation: 探索如何在不改变模型的情况下，通过测试时缩放提升放射学报告生成的推理性能。

Method: 引入TGT框架，结合医学先验知识，动态调整推理深度，实现更逻辑化的分析。

Result: 方法在标准基准测试中优于基线提示方法，生成更准确、一致的胸部X光报告。

Conclusion: TGT框架结合推理预算策略，显著提升了模型的推理能力和报告质量。

Abstract: Test-time scaling offers a promising way to improve the reasoning performance
of vision-language large models (VLLMs) without additional training. In this
paper, we explore a simple but effective approach for applying test-time
scaling to radiology report generation. Specifically, we introduce a
lightweight Thought Graph Traversal (TGT) framework that guides the model to
reason through organ-specific findings in a medically coherent order. This
framework integrates structured medical priors into the prompt, enabling deeper
and more logical analysis with no changes to the underlying model. To further
enhance reasoning depth, we apply a reasoning budget forcing strategy that
adjusts the model's inference depth at test time by dynamically extending its
generation process. This simple yet powerful combination allows a frozen
radiology VLLM to self-correct and generate more accurate, consistent chest
X-ray reports. Our method outperforms baseline prompting approaches on standard
benchmarks, and also reveals dataset biases through traceable reasoning paths.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新型多模态推理模型VGR，通过增强细粒度视觉感知能力，解决了现有方法在语言空间推理中的语言偏差和领域限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态推理方法主要依赖语言空间，存在语言偏差且局限于数学或科学领域，难以处理需要全面理解图像细节的复杂视觉推理任务。

Method: VGR通过检测相关图像区域并基于这些区域提供精确答案，结合大规模SFT数据集VGR-SFT，引入推理过程中的视觉参考和重放阶段。

Result: 在LLaVA-NeXT-7B基线上，VGR在多模态基准测试中表现优异，仅使用30%的图像标记数，在MMStar、AI2D和ChartQA上分别提升4.1、7.1和12.9分。

Conclusion: VGR通过结合视觉区域检测和语言推理，显著提升了多模态理解能力，为复杂视觉推理任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In the field of multimodal chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, existing
approaches predominantly rely on reasoning on pure language space, which
inherently suffers from language bias and is largely confined to math or
science domains. This narrow focus limits their ability to handle complex
visual reasoning tasks that demand comprehensive understanding of image
details. To address these limitations, this paper introduces VGR, a novel
reasoning multimodal large language model (MLLM) with enhanced fine-grained
visual perception capabilities. Unlike traditional MLLMs that answer the
question or reasoning solely on the language space, our VGR first detects
relevant regions that may help to solve problems, and then provides precise
answers based on replayed image regions. To achieve this, we conduct a
large-scale SFT dataset called VGR -SFT that contains reasoning data with mixed
vision grounding and language deduction. The inference pipeline of VGR allows
the model to choose bounding boxes for visual reference and a replay stage is
introduced to integrates the corresponding regions into the reasoning process,
enhancing multimodel comprehension. Experiments on the LLaVA-NeXT-7B baseline
show that VGR achieves superior performance on multi-modal benchmarks requiring
comprehensive image detail understanding. Compared to the baseline, VGR uses
only 30\% of the image token count while delivering scores of +4.1 on MMStar,
+7.1 on AI2D, and a +12.9 improvement on ChartQA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索术前身体组成指标对术后结果的预测能力，以改善手术风险评估和患者管理。

Method: 使用Cox比例风险模型和逻辑回归，评估300多个CT提取特征（如肌肉面积、脂肪面积等）与术后结果的关系。

Result: 通过C指数和IBS评估预测性能，同时分析术后并发症、再入院等次要结果。

Conclusion: 术前CT身体组成指标可能有助于预测结肠切除术后结果，尤其是1年死亡率。

Abstract: Objective: To evaluate whether preoperative body composition metrics
automatically extracted from CT scans can predict postoperative outcomes after
colectomy, either alone or combined with clinical variables or existing risk
predictors. Main outcomes and measures: The primary outcome was the predictive
performance for 1-year all-cause mortality following colectomy. A Cox
proportional hazards model with 1-year follow-up was used, and performance was
evaluated using the concordance index (C-index) and Integrated Brier Score
(IBS). Secondary outcomes included postoperative complications, unplanned
readmission, blood transfusion, and severe infection, assessed using AUC and
Brier Score from logistic regression. Odds ratios (OR) described associations
between individual CT-derived body composition metrics and outcomes. Over 300
features were extracted from preoperative CTs across multiple vertebral levels,
including skeletal muscle area, density, fat areas, and inter-tissue metrics.
NSQIP scores were available for all surgeries after 2012.

TL;DR: Affogato是一个大规模基准数据集，用于解决基于自然语言描述的交互对象区域定位问题，包含150K实例，支持开放词汇和3D热图标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决交互对象区域定位的挑战，包括细粒度部分定位、多有效交互区域的模糊性以及数据集的稀缺性。

Method: 开发基于预训练部分感知视觉主干和文本条件热图解码器的视觉语言模型。

Result: 模型在现有2D和3D基准测试中表现良好，并展示出开放词汇跨域泛化的有效性。

Conclusion: Affogato数据集为交互对象区域定位提供了有效支持，并公开共享。

Abstract: Affordance grounding-localizing object regions based on natural language
descriptions of interactions-is a critical challenge for enabling intelligent
agents to understand and interact with their environments. However, this task
remains challenging due to the need for fine-grained part-level localization,
the ambiguity arising from multiple valid interaction regions, and the scarcity
of large-scale datasets. In this work, we introduce Affogato, a large-scale
benchmark comprising 150K instances, annotated with open-vocabulary text
descriptions and corresponding 3D affordance heatmaps across a diverse set of
objects and interactions. Building on this benchmark, we develop simple yet
effective vision-language models that leverage pretrained part-aware vision
backbones and a text-conditional heatmap decoder. Our models trained with the
Affogato dataset achieve promising performance on the existing 2D and 3D
benchmarks, and notably, exhibit effectiveness in open-vocabulary cross-domain
generalization. The Affogato dataset is shared in public:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法因网络架构和数据质量的固有局限性，难以区分具有挑战性的候选图像。

Method: 提出了一个即插即用的测试时人机交互（THI）模块，通过多轮交互和多模态大语言模型（MLLM）对齐查询意图与潜在目标图像；同时引入重组数据增强（RDA）策略，通过信息丰富和多样性增强提升查询区分能力。

Result: 在四个TIReID基准测试（CUHK-PEDES、ICFG-PEDES、RSTPReid和UFine6926）上取得了显著性能提升。

Conclusion: ICL框架通过人机交互和数据增强有效解决了现有方法的局限性，显著提升了TIReID任务的性能。

Abstract: Despite remarkable advancements in text-to-image person re-identification
(TIReID) facilitated by the breakthrough of cross-modal embedding models,
existing methods often struggle to distinguish challenging candidate images due
to intrinsic limitations, such as network architecture and data quality. To
address these issues, we propose an Interactive Cross-modal Learning framework
(ICL), which leverages human-centered interaction to enhance the
discriminability of text queries through external multimodal knowledge. To
achieve this, we propose a plug-and-play Test-time Humane-centered Interaction
(THI) module, which performs visual question answering focused on human
characteristics, facilitating multi-round interactions with a multimodal large
language model (MLLM) to align query intent with latent target images.
Specifically, THI refines user queries based on the MLLM responses to reduce
the gap to the best-matching images, thereby boosting ranking accuracy.
Additionally, to address the limitation of low-quality training texts, we
introduce a novel Reorganization Data Augmentation (RDA) strategy based on
information enrichment and diversity enhancement to enhance query
discriminability by enriching, decomposing, and reorganizing person
descriptions. Extensive experiments on four TIReID benchmarks, i.e.,
CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, RSTPReid, and UFine6926, demonstrate that our method
achieves remarkable performance with substantial improvement.

Result: 随机森林分类器准确率为88.58%，并能识别不同严重程度的阅读障碍。

Conclusion: 结合眼动追踪与机器学习为阅读障碍诊断提供了高准确性和可及性的新方法。

Abstract: Dyslexia, affecting an estimated 10% to 20% of the global population,
significantly impairs learning capabilities, highlighting the need for
innovative and accessible diagnostic methods. This paper investigates the
effectiveness of eye-tracking technology combined with machine learning
algorithms as a cost-effective alternative for early dyslexia detection. By
analyzing general eye movement patterns, including prolonged fixation durations
and erratic saccades, we proposed an enhanced solution for determining
eye-tracking-based dyslexia features. A Random Forest Classifier was then
employed to detect dyslexia, achieving an accuracy of 88.58\%. Additionally,
hierarchical clustering methods were applied to identify varying severity
levels of dyslexia. The analysis incorporates diverse methodologies across
various populations and settings, demonstrating the potential of this
technology to identify individuals with dyslexia, including those with
borderline traits, through non-invasive means. Integrating eye-tracking with
machine learning represents a significant advancement in the diagnostic
process, offering a highly accurate and accessible method in clinical research.

Conclusion: 建议采用严格的方法评估数据发现的有用性，以缓解计算与基础数据科学的分歧，促进数据科学的健康发展。

Abstract: This manuscript provides a holistic (data-centric) view of what we term
essential data science, as a natural ecosystem with challenges and missions
stemming from the data universe with its multiple combinations of the 5D
complexities (data structure, domain, cardinality, causality, and ethics) with
the phases of the data life cycle. Data agents perform tasks driven by specific
goals. The data scientist is an abstract entity that comes from the logical
organization of data agents with their actions. Data scientists face challenges
that are defined according to the missions. We define specific
discipline-induced data science, which in turn allows for the definition of
pan-data science, a natural ecosystem that integrates specific disciplines with
the essential data science. We semantically split the essential data science
into computational, and foundational. We claim that there is a serious threat
of divergence between computational and foundational data science. Especially,
if no approach is taken to rate whether a data universe discovery should be
useful or not. We suggest that rigorous approaches to measure the usefulness of
data universe discoveries might mitigate such a divergence.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在个性化和泛化能力上优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该方法在多模态PFL中有效解决了真实场景的异构性问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Foundation models have shown remarkable capabilities across diverse
multi-modal tasks, but their centralized training raises privacy concerns and
induces high transmission costs. In contrast, federated learning (FL) offers a
distributed alternative without the need to share data. Recently, for the
growing demand for personalizing AI models for different user purposes,
personalized federated learning (PFL) has emerged. PFL allows each client to
leverage the knowledge of other clients for further adaptation to individual
user preferences, again without the need to share data. Despite its potential,
most PFL studies remain confined to simulated environments, overlooking the
data and model heterogeneity that arise in real-world scenarios. In contrast,
we first consider large data heterogeneity, evaluating on a new benchmark for
multi-modal PFL, spanning 40 distinct tasks with realistic data distribution
shifts. We then consider model heterogeneity in that we do not assume that all
clients share similar model architectures. To address data heterogeneity, we
propose a task-similarity-aware model aggregation method that provides
customized global models to each client. For model heterogeneity, we propose a
dimension-invariant module that enables knowledge sharing across heterogeneous
models. Empirical validations demonstrate that the proposed approach
outperforms the state-of-the-art, excelling in both personalization and
generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: 该方法为缺乏训练资源的编程语言提供了一种有效的代码生成解决方案。

Abstract: Generating accurate and executable code using large language models (LLMs) is
challenging for languages with limited public training data compared to popular
languages such as Python. This paper introduces a generalizable approach that
uses small-scale code versions of the Qwen 2.5 model combined with Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enable effective code generation through
explicit reasoning steps, which is particularly beneficial for languages with
smaller source code databases. Using Prolog as a representative use case --
given its limited online presence -- the initial model faced challenges in
generating executable code. After some training steps, the model successfully
produces logically consistent and syntactically accurate code by directly
integrating reasoning-driven feedback into the reinforcement learning loop.
Experimental evaluations using mathematical logic problem benchmarks illustrate
significant improvements in reasoning quality, code accuracy, and logical
correctness, underscoring the potential of this approach to benefit a wide
range of programming languages lacking extensive training resources.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of contagious disease outbreaks is vital for informed
decision-making. Our study addresses the gap between machine learning
algorithms and their epidemiological applications, noting that methods optimal
for benchmark datasets often underperform with real-world data due to
difficulties in incorporating mobility information. We adopt a two-phase
approach: first, assessing the significance of mobility data through a pilot
study, then evaluating the impact of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) on a
transformer backbone. Our findings reveal that while mobility data and GCN
modules do not significantly enhance forecasting performance, the inclusion of
mortality and hospitalization data markedly improves model accuracy.
Additionally, a comparative analysis between GCN-derived spatial maps and
lockdown orders suggests a notable correlation, highlighting the potential of
spatial maps as sensitive indicators for mobility. Our research offers a novel
perspective on mobility representation in predictive modeling for contagious
diseases, empowering decision-makers to better prepare for future outbreaks.

Motivation: 传统的时间序列预测方法（直接或递归）存在局限性，需要一种更高效的框架。

Method: 提出YingLong框架，采用非因果、双向注意力编码器-仅变换器，通过掩码令牌恢复训练，并结合多输入集成减少输出方差。

Result: 在ETT和Weather数据集上，YingLong在零样本任务中表现优异，300M参数模型在GIFT-Eval基准测试中显著优于其他模型。

Conclusion: YingLong框架在时间序列预测中具有显著优势，尤其在长输出任务中表现更优。

Abstract: We present a joint forecasting framework for time series prediction that
contrasts with traditional direct or recursive methods. This framework achieves
state-of-the-art performance for our designed foundation model, YingLong, and
reveals a novel scaling effect: longer outputs significantly enhance model
accuracy due to delayed chain-of-thought reasoning in our non-causal approach.
YingLong is a non-causal, bidirectional attention encoder-only transformer
trained through masked token recovery, aligning more effectively with language
understanding tasks than with generation tasks. Additionally, we boost
performance by tackling output variance with a multi-input ensemble. We release
four foundation models ranging from 6M to 300M parameters, demonstrating
superior results in zero-shot tasks on the ETT and Weather datasets. YingLong
achieves more than 60% best performance. To ensure generalizability, we
assessed the models using the GIFT-Eval benchmark, which comprises 23 time
series datasets across 7 domains. Yinglong significantly outperformed the best
time-series foundation models, end-to-end trained models by 14% and 44% in rank
respectively.The pretrained 300M model is available at

*Nazmus Saadat As-Saquib,A N M Nafiz Abeer,Hung-Ta Chien,Byung-Jun Yoon,Suhas Kumar,Su-in Yi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Forward Target Propagation (FTP)的生物可解释且计算高效的方法，替代传统的反向传播(BP)，通过前向计算实现模块化和局部学习，并在多种网络结构和任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统反向传播(BP)在生物和硬件视角存在局限性，如对称权重、非局部信用分配和冻结活动等问题，需要一种更高效且生物可解释的替代方法。

Method: FTP通过两次前向传递替代反向传播，仅使用前向计算估计层间目标，无需对称反馈权重或可学习逆函数。

Result: FTP在MNIST、CIFAR10和CIFAR100等任务中表现与BP相当，且在低精度量化和新兴硬件约束下优于BP，计算效率更高。

Conclusion: FTP以其低计算开销、前向特性和硬件兼容性，为高效设备学习和神经形态计算提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Training neural networks has traditionally relied on backpropagation (BP), a
gradient-based algorithm that, despite its widespread success, suffers from key
limitations in both biological and hardware perspectives. These include
backward error propagation by symmetric weights, non-local credit assignment,
and frozen activity during backward passes. We propose Forward Target
Propagation (FTP), a biologically plausible and computationally efficient
alternative that replaces the backward pass with a second forward pass. FTP
estimates layerwise targets using only feedforward computations, eliminating
the need for symmetric feedback weights or learnable inverse functions, hence
enabling modular and local learning. We evaluate FTP on fully connected
networks, CNNs, and RNNs, demonstrating accuracies competitive with BP on
MNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100, as well as effective modeling of long-term
dependencies in sequential tasks. Moreover, FTP outperforms BP under quantized
low-precision and emerging hardware constraints while also demonstrating
substantial efficiency gains over other biologically inspired methods such as
target propagation variants and forward-only learning algorithms. With its
minimal computational overhead, forward-only nature, and hardware
compatibility, FTP provides a promising direction for energy-efficient
on-device learning and neuromorphic computing.

*Zoher Kachwala,Danishjeet Singh,Danielle Yang,Filippo Menczer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了利用预训练的视觉语言模型（VLMs）进行零样本检测AI生成图像的方法，提出了一种任务对齐提示方法（zero-shot-s²），显著提升了检测性能，且无需微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着图像生成器生成的图像越来越逼真，对其潜在滥用的担忧增加。传统监督检测方法依赖大型标注数据集且难以泛化，因此探索零样本检测方法具有重要意义。

Method: 使用预训练的VLMs，通过任务对齐提示（如“Let's examine the style and the synthesis artifacts”）引导模型更聚焦的推理，显著提升检测性能。

Result: zero-shot-s²方法在多个数据集和模型上提升了Macro F1分数8%-29%，表现出强泛化能力和对模型规模的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 任务对齐提示能激发VLMs的潜在能力，为AI生成图像检测提供了一种简单、可泛化且可解释的替代方案。

Abstract: As image generators produce increasingly realistic images, concerns about
potential misuse continue to grow. Supervised detection relies on large,
curated datasets and struggles to generalize across diverse generators. In this
work, we investigate the use of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for
zero-shot detection of AI-generated images. While off-the-shelf VLMs exhibit
some task-specific reasoning and chain-of-thought prompting offers gains, we
show that task-aligned prompting elicits more focused reasoning and
significantly improves performance without fine-tuning. Specifically, prefixing
the model's response with the phrase ``Let's examine the style and the
synthesis artifacts'' -- a method we call zero-shot-s$^2$ -- boosts Macro F1
scores by 8%-29% for two widely used open-source models. These gains are
consistent across three recent, diverse datasets spanning human faces, objects,
and animals with images generated by 16 different models -- demonstrating
strong generalization. We further evaluate the approach across three additional
model sizes and observe improvements in most dataset-model combinations --
suggesting robustness to model scale. Surprisingly, self-consistency, a
behavior previously observed in language reasoning, where aggregating answers
from diverse reasoning paths improves performance, also holds in this setting.
Even here, zero-shot-s$^2$ scales better than chain-of-thought in most cases --
indicating that it elicits more useful diversity. Our findings show that
task-aligned prompts elicit more focused reasoning and enhance latent
capabilities in VLMs, like the detection of AI-generated images -- offering a
simple, generalizable, and explainable alternative to supervised methods. Our
code is publicly available on github:

TL;DR: 提出了一种运行时屏蔽机制，用于强化学习中的安全风险控制，通过实时推断隐藏参数并预测未来风险，确保策略的安全性和最优性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐藏参数（如机器人质量分布或摩擦）的变化可能导致执行过程中的安全风险，需要一种机制来实时适应和保障安全。

Method: 基于约束隐藏参数马尔可夫决策过程，利用函数编码器实时推断隐藏参数，结合保形预测处理不确定性，并通过屏蔽机制限制动作空间。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著减少安全违规，并实现强泛化能力，同时运行时开销极小。

Conclusion: 提出的机制满足概率安全保证，并在安全合规策略中实现最优性能。

Abstract: Variations in hidden parameters, such as a robot's mass distribution or
friction, pose safety risks during execution. We develop a runtime shielding
mechanism for reinforcement learning, building on the formalism of constrained
hidden-parameter Markov decision processes. Function encoders enable real-time
inference of hidden parameters from observations, allowing the shield and the
underlying policy to adapt online. The shield constrains the action space by
forecasting future safety risks (such as obstacle proximity) and accounts for
uncertainty via conformal prediction. We prove that the proposed mechanism
satisfies probabilistic safety guarantees and yields optimal policies among the
set of safety-compliant policies. Experiments across diverse environments with
varying hidden parameters show that our method significantly reduces safety
violations and achieves strong out-of-distribution generalization, while
incurring minimal runtime overhead.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个多模态上下文学习的视觉因果推理基准（CausalVLBench），评估了现有大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在因果推理任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）在因果推理任务中表现出色，但视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在视觉因果推理任务中的能力尚未充分研究。

Method: 提出了CausalVLBench基准，包含因果结构推断、干预目标预测和反事实预测三个任务，并在三个因果表示学习数据集上评估了LVLMs。

Result: 展示了当前LVLMs在视觉因果推理任务中的基本优势和不足。

Conclusion: 希望通过该基准揭示现有视觉语言模型的缺陷，并推动改进LVLMs视觉因果推理能力的新方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable ability in various
language tasks, especially with their emergent in-context learning capability.
Extending LLMs to incorporate visual inputs, large vision-language models
(LVLMs) have shown impressive performance in tasks such as recognition and
visual question answering (VQA). Despite increasing interest in the utility of
LLMs in causal reasoning tasks such as causal discovery and counterfactual
reasoning, there has been relatively little work showcasing the abilities of
LVLMs on visual causal reasoning tasks. We take this opportunity to formally
introduce a comprehensive causal reasoning benchmark for multi-modal in-context
learning from LVLMs. Our CausalVLBench encompasses three representative tasks:
causal structure inference, intervention target prediction, and counterfactual
prediction. We evaluate the ability of state-of-the-art open-source LVLMs on
our causal reasoning tasks across three causal representation learning datasets
and demonstrate their fundamental strengths and weaknesses. We hope that our
benchmark elucidates the drawbacks of existing vision-language models and
motivates new directions and paradigms in improving the visual causal reasoning
abilities of LVLMs.

*Moussa Koulako Bala Doumbouya,Dan Jurafsky,Christopher D. Manning*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Tversky相似性理论的深度学习模型，通过可微分参数化实现了Tversky投影层，在图像分类和语言建模任务中表现优于传统线性投影层。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习的几何相似性模型与人类心理感知不符，而Tversky的基于特征的相似性理论更符合心理学，但尚未在深度学习中应用。

Method: 开发了可微分参数化的Tversky相似性模型，并设计了Tversky投影层，用于替换线性投影层。

Result: 在NABirds图像分类任务中，Tversky投影层相对基线提升了24.7%的准确率；在GPT-2的PTB任务中，困惑度降低7.5%，参数减少34.8%。

Conclusion: Tversky投影层为深度学习提供了一种更符合心理学的相似性模型，并提升了模型的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Work in psychology has highlighted that the geometric model of similarity
standard in deep learning is not psychologically plausible because its metric
properties such as symmetry do not align with human perception. In contrast,
Tversky (1977) proposed an axiomatic theory of similarity based on a
representation of objects as sets of features, and their similarity as a
function of common and distinctive features. However, this model has not been
used in deep learning before, partly due to the challenge of incorporating
discrete set operations. We develop a differentiable parameterization of
Tversky's similarity that is learnable through gradient descent, and derive
neural network building blocks such as the Tversky projection layer, which
unlike the linear projection layer can model non-linear functions such as XOR.
Through experiments with image recognition and language modeling, we show that
the Tversky projection layer is a beneficial replacement for the linear
projection layer, which employs geometric similarity. On the NABirds image
classification task, a frozen ResNet-50 adapted with a Tversky projection layer
achieves a 24.7% relative accuracy improvement over the linear layer adapter
baseline. With Tversky projection layers, GPT-2's perplexity on PTB decreases
by 7.5%, and its parameter count by 34.8%. Finally, we propose a unified
interpretation of both projection layers as computing similarities of input
stimuli to learned prototypes, for which we also propose a novel visualization
technique highlighting the interpretability of Tversky projection layers. Our
work offers a new paradigm for thinking about the similarity model implicit in
deep learning, and designing networks that are interpretable under an
established theory of psychological similarity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为GRePO-LTV的新框架，用于解决LTV预测中的数据稀缺和任务依赖性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LTV预测对广告商至关重要，但数据稀缺和任务间的高相关性使其成为挑战。

Method: 使用图表示学习解决数据稀缺问题，并通过帕累托优化处理任务间的依赖性。

Result: GRePO-LTV框架能够有效提升LTV预测的准确性。

Conclusion: GRePO-LTV为LTV预测提供了一种创新且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The LifeTime Value (LTV) prediction, which endeavors to forecast the
cumulative purchase contribution of a user to a particular item, remains a
vital challenge that advertisers are keen to resolve. A precise LTV prediction
system enhances the alignment of user interests with meticulously designed
advertisements, thereby generating substantial profits for advertisers.
Nonetheless, this issue is complicated by the paucity of data typically
observed in real-world advertising scenarios. The purchase rate among
registered users is often as critically low as 0.1%, resulting in a dataset
where the majority of users make only several purchases. Consequently, there is
insufficient supervisory signal for effectively training the LTV prediction
model. An additional challenge emerges from the interdependencies among tasks
with high correlation. It is a common practice to estimate a user's
contribution to a game over a specified temporal interval. Varying the lengths
of these intervals corresponds to distinct predictive tasks, which are highly
correlated. For instance, predictions over a 7-day period are heavily reliant
on forecasts made over a 3-day period, where exceptional cases can adversely
affect the accuracy of both tasks. In order to comprehensively address the
aforementioned challenges, we introduce an innovative framework denoted as
Graph-Represented Pareto-Optimal LifeTime Value prediction (GRePO-LTV). Graph
representation learning is initially employed to address the issue of data
scarcity. Subsequently, Pareto-Optimization is utilized to manage the
interdependence of prediction tasks.

Motivation: 解决类增量学习中预训练模型面临的提示覆盖和维度不对齐问题，以及混合专家（MoE）在动态环境中参数易被覆盖的挑战。

Method: 提出MoTE框架，结合加权特征融合和稀疏激活机制，引入任务感知专家过滤和可靠专家联合推理。

Result: 实验表明MoTE在不需示例集的情况下表现优越，且任务数量与适配器数量线性扩展。

Conclusion: MoTE有效解决了类增量学习中的维度不一致问题，并探索了适配器扩展与性能的权衡，提出了Adapter-Limited MoTE。

Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) requires deep learning models to
continuously acquire new knowledge from streaming data while preserving
previously learned information. Recently, CIL based on pre-trained models
(PTMs) has achieved remarkable success. However, prompt-based approaches suffer
from prompt overwriting, while adapter-based methods face challenges such as
dimensional misalignment between tasks. While the idea of expert fusion in
Mixture of Experts (MoE) can help address dimensional inconsistency, both
expert and routing parameters are prone to being overwritten in dynamic
environments, making MoE challenging to apply directly in CIL. To tackle these
issues, we propose a mixture of task-specific experts (MoTE) framework that
effectively mitigates the miscalibration caused by inconsistent output
dimensions across tasks. Inspired by the weighted feature fusion and sparse
activation mechanisms in MoE, we introduce task-aware expert filtering and
reliable expert joint inference during the inference phase, mimicking the
behavior of routing layers without inducing catastrophic forgetting. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method without requiring an
exemplar set. Furthermore, the number of tasks in MoTE scales linearly with the
number of adapters. Building on this, we further explore the trade-off between
adapter expansion and model performance and propose the Adapter-Limited MoTE.

*Cheng Jin,Zhenyu Xiao,Chutao Liu,Yuantao Gu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) enhances text-to-image alignment but causes color distortions at high guidance weights. The proposed Angle Domain Guidance (ADG) mitigates distortions while maintaining alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CFG improves text-to-image synthesis but introduces color distortions at high guidance weights, necessitating a solution.

Method: The authors analyze norm amplification in latent space, propose a theoretical framework, and develop ADG to constrain magnitude while optimizing angular alignment.

Result: ADG outperforms existing methods, improving color fidelity and perceptual alignment while preserving text-image alignment.

Conclusion: ADG effectively addresses color distortions in CFG, offering a balanced solution for high-quality image synthesis.

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) has emerged as a pivotal advancement in
text-to-image latent diffusion models, establishing itself as a cornerstone
technique for achieving high-quality image synthesis. However, under high
guidance weights, where text-image alignment is significantly enhanced, CFG
also leads to pronounced color distortions in the generated images. We identify
that these distortions stem from the amplification of sample norms in the
latent space. We present a theoretical framework that elucidates the mechanisms
of norm amplification and anomalous diffusion phenomena induced by
classifier-free guidance. Leveraging our theoretical insights and the latent
space structure, we propose an Angle Domain Guidance (ADG) algorithm. ADG
constrains magnitude variations while optimizing angular alignment, thereby
mitigating color distortions while preserving the enhanced text-image alignment
achieved at higher guidance weights. Experimental results demonstrate that ADG
significantly outperforms existing methods, generating images that not only
maintain superior text alignment but also exhibit improved color fidelity and
better alignment with human perceptual preferences.

Abstract: Time series analysis is pivotal in domains like financial forecasting and
biomedical monitoring, yet traditional methods are constrained by limited
nonlinear feature representation and long-term dependency capture. The
emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers transformative potential by
leveraging their cross-modal knowledge integration and inherent attention
mechanisms for time series analysis. However, the development of
general-purpose LLMs for time series from scratch is still hindered by data
diversity, annotation scarcity, and computational requirements. This paper
presents a systematic review of pre-trained LLM-driven time series analysis,
focusing on enabling techniques, potential applications, and open challenges.
First, it establishes an evolutionary roadmap of AI-driven time series
analysis, from the early machine learning era, through the emerging LLM-driven
paradigm, to the development of native temporal foundation models. Second, it
organizes and systematizes the technical landscape of LLM-driven time series
analysis from a workflow perspective, covering LLMs' input, optimization, and
lightweight stages. Finally, it critically examines novel real-world
applications and highlights key open challenges that can guide future research
and innovation. The work not only provides valuable insights into current
advances but also outlines promising directions for future development. It
serves as a foundational reference for both academic and industrial
researchers, paving the way for the development of more efficient,
generalizable, and interpretable systems of LLM-driven time series analysis.

Result: 在USPTO数据集上，ChemHGNN显著优于HGNN和GNN基线，尤其在大规模场景下，同时保持可解释性和化学合理性。

Conclusion: ChemHGNN为反应虚拟筛选和发现提供了更优的解决方案，推动了反应发现的加速。

Abstract: Reaction virtual screening and discovery are fundamental challenges in
chemistry and materials science, where traditional graph neural networks (GNNs)
struggle to model multi-reactant interactions. In this work, we propose
ChemHGNN, a hypergraph neural network (HGNN) framework that effectively
captures high-order relationships in reaction networks. Unlike GNNs, which
require constructing complete graphs for multi-reactant reactions, ChemHGNN
naturally models multi-reactant reactions through hyperedges, enabling more
expressive reaction representations. To address key challenges, such as
combinatorial explosion, model collapse, and chemically invalid negative
samples, we introduce a reaction center-aware negative sampling strategy (RCNS)
and a hierarchical embedding approach combining molecule, reaction and
hypergraph level features. Experiments on the USPTO dataset demonstrate that
ChemHGNN significantly outperforms HGNN and GNN baselines, particularly in
large-scale settings, while maintaining interpretability and chemical
plausibility. Our work establishes HGNNs as a superior alternative to GNNs for
reaction virtual screening and discovery, offering a chemically informed
framework for accelerating reaction discovery.

Conclusion: GenFT为高效模型适应提供了新视角。

Abstract: Pretrained Foundation Models (PFMs) have transformed numerous applications by
enabling efficient adaptation to customized tasks. Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a resource-efficient alternative to full
fine-tuning, especially leveraging reparameterized weights $\Delta W$ to adapt
models for downstream tasks. However, a critical yet underexplored question
remains: can we utilize well-pretrained weights $W_0$ to guide the update of
task-specific $\Delta W$, avoiding inefficient training it from scratch? To end
this, we propose Generative Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (GenFT), a novel
method that extracts structured, transferable information from $W_0$ for
efficient $\Delta W$ training. To extract row and column structure information,
GenFT applies row and column transformations to distill essential patterns from
$W_0$. A tailored policy further decomposes $\Delta W$ into layer-shared and
layer-specific components, balancing information reuse and individualized
flexibility. GenFT is simple yet effective, achieving superior performance
across CV and NLP tasks. Extensive experiments on VTAB-1K, FGVC, and GLUE
benchmarks demonstrate that GenFT outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT methods,
offering a new perspective for efficient model adaptation.

Abstract: Existing post-training quantization methods for large language models (LLMs)
offer remarkable success. However, the increasingly marginal performance gains
suggest that existing quantization strategies are insufficient to support the
development of more compressed models. To inspire new directions for future
research, this paper introduces the concept of null space into LLMs
quantization. We argue that the quantization error can be effectively
alleviated by constraining the post-quantization weight perturbation to lie
within the null space of input activations. To prove this idea, we propose a
plug-and-play null space projection module for existing milestone PTQ baselines
named Q2N. Specifically, we first design an efficient and accurate null space
projection approximation method tailored to the characteristics of LLMs.
Subsequently, we theoretically derive a closed-form solution for an equivalent
vector of the obtained projection matrix, which satisfies practical inference
condition while avoiding additional memory overhead. Extensive experiments are
conducted on various state-of-the-art LLMs (LLaMA3, DeepSeek, Qwen3) and
baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of both our Q2N and the perspective
of null space optimization for LLMs quantization. We view this paper the first
step to further alleviate the quantization error based on the insights of null
space, hoping it inspiring future researchers to design more advanced
quantization methods. Codes are available at https://github.com/zjq0455/q2n.

Abstract: Although the power of LLM tool-use agents has ignited a flurry of recent
research in this area, the curation of tool-use training data remains an open
problem$-$especially for online RL training. Existing approaches to synthetic
tool-use data generation tend to be non-interactive, and/or non-compositional.
We introduce RandomWorld, a pipeline for the procedural generation of
interactive tools and compositional tool-use data. We show that models tuned
via SFT and RL on synthetic RandomWorld data improve on a range of tool-use
benchmarks, and set the new SoTA for two metrics on the NESTFUL dataset.
Further experiments show that downstream performance scales with the amount of
RandomWorld-generated training data, opening up the possibility of further
improvement through the use of entirely synthetic data.

We study the impact of different data augmentation methods on confidence

Abstract: Machine learning systems are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains,
yet they remain vulnerable to bias systematic disparities that
disproportionately impact specific demographic groups. Traditional bias
detection methods often depend on access to sensitive labels or rely on rigid
fairness metrics, limiting their applicability in real-world settings. This
paper introduces a novel, perception-driven framework for bias detection that
leverages crowdsourced human judgment. Inspired by reCAPTCHA and other
crowd-powered systems, we present a lightweight web platform that displays
stripped-down visualizations of numeric data (for example-salary distributions
across demographic clusters) and collects binary judgments on group similarity.
We explore how users' visual perception-shaped by layout, spacing, and question
phrasing can signal potential disparities. User feedback is aggregated to flag
data segments as biased, which are then validated through statistical tests and
machine learning cross-evaluations. Our findings show that perceptual signals
from non-expert users reliably correlate with known bias cases, suggesting that
visual intuition can serve as a powerful, scalable proxy for fairness auditing.
This approach offers a label-efficient, interpretable alternative to
conventional fairness diagnostics, paving the way toward human-aligned,
crowdsourced bias detection pipelines.

Abstract: The increasing congestion of the radio frequency spectrum presents challenges
for efficient spectrum utilization. Cognitive radio systems enable dynamic
spectrum access with the aid of recent innovations in neural networks. However,
traditional real-valued neural networks (RVNNs) face difficulties in low
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environments, as they were not specifically
developed to capture essential wireless signal properties such as phase and
amplitude. This work presents CMuSeNet, a complex-valued multi-signal
segmentation network for wideband spectrum sensing, to address these
limitations. Extensive hyperparameter analysis shows that a naive conversion of
existing RVNNs into their complex-valued counterparts is ineffective. Built on
complex-valued neural networks (CVNNs) with a residual architecture, CMuSeNet
introduces a complexvalued Fourier spectrum focal loss (CFL) and a complex
plane intersection over union (CIoU) similarity metric to enhance training
performance. Extensive evaluations on synthetic, indoor overthe-air, and
real-world datasets show that CMuSeNet achieves an average accuracy of
98.98%-99.90%, improving by up to 9.2 percentage points over its real-valued
counterpart and consistently outperforms state of the art. Strikingly, CMuSeNet
achieves the accuracy level of its RVNN counterpart in just two epochs,
compared to the 27 epochs required for RVNN, while reducing training time by up
to a 92.2% over the state of the art. The results highlight the effectiveness
of complex-valued architectures in improving weak signal detection and training
efficiency for spectrum sensing in challenging low-SNR environments. The
dataset is available at: https://dx.doi.org/10.21227/hcc1-6p22

TL;DR: NSW-EPNews是首个结合时间序列模型和大型语言模型（LLM）的电力价格预测基准，包含多模态数据，但LLM表现有限且易产生幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有电力价格预测方法依赖历史数值数据，忽略了文本信号，需多模态评估框架。

Method: 构建包含价格、天气和新闻的多模态数据集，设计48步预测任务，评估传统模型和LLM。

Conclusion: NSW-EPNews为多模态数值推理提供测试平台，揭示LLM在高风险能源预测中的能力差距。

Abstract: Electricity price forecasting is a critical component of modern
energy-management systems, yet existing approaches heavily rely on numerical
histories and ignore contemporaneous textual signals. We introduce NSW-EPNews,
the first benchmark that jointly evaluates time-series models and large
language models (LLMs) on real-world electricity-price prediction. The dataset
includes over 175,000 half-hourly spot prices from New South Wales, Australia
(2015-2024), daily temperature readings, and curated market-news summaries from
WattClarity. We frame the task as 48-step-ahead forecasting, using multimodal
input, including lagged prices, vectorized news and weather features for
classical models, and prompt-engineered structured contexts for LLMs. Our
datasets yields 3.6k multimodal prompt-output pairs for LLM evaluation using
specific templates. Through compresive benchmark design, we identify that for
traditional statistical and machine learning models, the benefits gain is
marginal from news feature. For state-of-the-art LLMs, such as GPT-4o and
Gemini 1.5 Pro, we observe modest performance increase while it also produce
frequent hallucinations such as fabricated and malformed price sequences.
NSW-EPNews provides a rigorous testbed for evaluating grounded numerical
reasoning in multimodal settings, and highlights a critical gap between current
LLM capabilities and the demands of high-stakes energy forecasting.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities, yet their direct application to NP-hard combinatorial problems
(CPs) remains underexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate the
reasoning abilities of LLMs on a variety of NP-hard combinatorial optimization
tasks and introduce ACCORD: Autoregressive Constraint-satisfying generation for
COmbinatorial optimization with Routing and Dynamic attention. ACCORD features
a novel dataset representation and model architecture that leverage the
autoregressive nature of LLMs to dynamically enforce feasibility constraints,
coupled with attention-based routing to activate problem-specific LoRA modules.
We also present the ACCORD-90k supervised dataset, covering six NP-hard
combinatorial problems: TSP, VRP, Knapsack, FlowShop, JSSP, and BinPacking.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ACCORD model, built on an
8B-parameter Llama backbone, consistently outperforms standard prompting and
input-output methods, even when compared to much larger LLMs, such as gpt-4.
Ablation studies further show that our output structure enhances solution
feasibility. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale,
end-to-end framework for exploring the applications of LLMs to a broad spectrum
of combinatorial optimization problems. The codes are publicly available at

Abstract: User Behavior Sequence (UBS) modeling is crucial in industrial applications.
As data scale and task diversity grow, UBS pretraining methods have become
increasingly pivotal. State-of-the-art UBS pretraining methods rely on
predicting behavior distributions. The key step in these methods is
constructing a selected behavior vocabulary. However, this manual step is
labor-intensive and prone to bias. The limitation of vocabulary capacity also
directly affects models' generalization ability. In this paper, we introduce
Bootstrapping Your Behavior (\model{}), a novel UBS pretraining strategy that
predicts an automatically constructed supervision embedding summarizing all
behaviors' information within a future time window, eliminating the manual
behavior vocabulary selection. In implementation, we incorporate a
student-teacher encoder scheme to construct the pretraining supervision
effectively. Experiments on two real-world industrial datasets and eight
downstream tasks demonstrate that \model{} achieves an average improvement of
3.9\% in AUC and 98.9\% in training throughput. Notably, the model exhibits
meaningful attention patterns and cluster representations during pretraining
without any label supervision. In our online deployment over two months, the
pretrained model improves the KS by about 2.7\% and 7.1\% over the baseline
model for two financial overdue risk prediction tasks in the Alipay mobile
application, which reduces bad debt risk by millions of dollars for Ant group.

Conclusion: 自适应MLaaS组合框架能有效应对IoT环境的不确定性，提升服务效率和可扩展性。

Abstract: The dynamic nature of Internet of Things (IoT) environments challenges the
long-term effectiveness of Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) compositions.
The uncertainty and variability of IoT environments lead to fluctuations in
data distribution, e.g., concept drift and data heterogeneity, and evolving
system requirements, e.g., scalability demands and resource limitations. This
paper proposes an adaptive MLaaS composition framework to ensure a seamless,
efficient, and scalable MLaaS composition. The framework integrates a service
assessment model to identify underperforming MLaaS services and a candidate
selection model to filter optimal replacements. An adaptive composition
mechanism is developed that incrementally updates MLaaS compositions using a
contextual multi-armed bandit optimization strategy. By continuously adapting
to evolving IoT constraints, the approach maintains Quality of Service (QoS)
while reducing the computational cost associated with recomposition from
scratch. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate the
efficiency of our proposed approach.

Abstract: Recent advances in Foundation Models for Materials Science are poised to
revolutionize the discovery, manufacture, and design of novel materials with
tailored properties and responses. Although great strides have been made,
successes have been restricted to materials classes where multi-million sample
data repositories can be readily curated (e.g., atomistic structures).
Unfortunately, for many structural and functional materials (e.g., mesoscale
structured metal alloys), such datasets are too costly or prohibitive to
construct; instead, datasets are limited to very few examples. To address this
challenge, we introduce a novel machine learning approach for learning from
hyper-sparse, complex spatial data in scientific domains. Our core contribution
is a physics-driven data augmentation scheme that leverages an ensemble of
local generative models, trained on as few as five experimental observations,
and coordinates them through a novel diversity curation strategy to generate a
large-scale, physically diverse dataset. We utilize this framework to construct
PolyMicros, the first Foundation Model for polycrystalline materials (a
structural material class important across a broad range of industrial and
scientific applications). We demonstrate the utility of PolyMicros by zero-shot
solving several long standing challenges related to accelerating 3D
experimental microscopy. Finally, we make both our models and datasets openly
available to the community.

Conclusion: 该方法为逆问题的优化过程提供了可解释的解释，有助于领域专家理解。

Abstract: Inverse problems are central to a wide range of fields, including healthcare,
climate science, and agriculture. They involve the estimation of inputs,
typically via iterative optimization, to some known forward model so that it
produces a desired outcome. Despite considerable development in the
explainability and interpretability of forward models, the iterative
optimization of inverse problems remains largely cryptic to domain experts. We
propose a methodology to produce explanations, from traces produced by an
optimizer, that are interpretable by humans at the abstraction of the domain.
The central idea in our approach is to instrument a differentiable simulator so
that it emits natural language events during its forward and backward passes.
In a post-process, we use a Language Model to create an explanation from the
list of events. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with an
illustrative optimization problem and an example involving the training of a
neural network.

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization (CO) problems, central to operation research and
theoretical computer science, present significant computational challenges due
to their NP-hard nature. While large language models (LLMs) have emerged as
promising tools for CO--either by directly generating solutions or synthesizing
solver-specific codes--existing approaches often neglect critical structural
priors inherent to CO problems, leading to suboptimality and iterative
inefficiency. Inspired by human experts' success in leveraging CO structures
for algorithm design, we propose STRCMP, a novel structure-aware LLM-based
algorithm discovery framework that systematically integrates structure priors
to enhance solution quality and solving efficiency. Our framework combines a
graph neural network (GNN) for extracting structural embeddings from CO
instances with an LLM conditioned on these embeddings to identify
high-performing algorithms in the form of solver-specific codes. This composite
architecture ensures syntactic correctness, preserves problem topology, and
aligns with natural language objectives, while an evolutionary refinement
process iteratively optimizes generated algorithm. Extensive evaluations across
Mixed Integer Linear Programming and Boolean Satisfiability problems, using
nine benchmark datasets, demonstrate that our proposed STRCMP outperforms five
strong neural and LLM-based methods by a large margin, in terms of both
solution optimality and computational efficiency. The code and learned model
will be publicly available upon the acceptance of the paper.

Result: 在AIME2024和GQA任务中，ADAMIX分别比最佳基线Delta-CoMe提升22.3%和6.1%。

Conclusion: ADAMIX通过优化位分配策略，显著提升压缩性能，适用于高压缩比场景。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive performance on various
knowledge-intensive and complex reasoning tasks in different domains. In
certain scenarios like multi-tenant serving, a large number of LLMs finetuned
from the same base model are deployed to meet complex requirements for users.
Recent works explore delta-compression approaches to quantize and compress the
delta parameters between the customized LLM and the corresponding base model.
However, existing works either exhibit unsatisfactory performance at high
compression ratios or depend on empirical bit allocation schemes. In this work,
we propose ADAMIX, an effective adaptive mixed-precision delta-compression
framework. We provide a mathematical derivation of quantization error to
motivate our mixed-precision compression strategy and formulate the optimal
mixed-precision bit allocation scheme as the solution to a 0/1 integer linear
programming problem. Our derived bit allocation strategy minimizes the
quantization error while adhering to a predefined compression ratio
requirement. Experimental results on various models and benchmarks demonstrate
that our approach surpasses the best baseline by a considerable margin. On
tasks like AIME2024 and GQA, where the norm of $\Delta \mathbf{W}$ is large and
the base model lacks sufficient ability, ADAMIX outperforms the best baseline
Delta-CoMe by 22.3% and 6.1% with 7B models, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有偏好学习框架简化人类偏好为二元比较和标量奖励，导致LLM响应偏向某些特征，迭代学习时问题加剧。

Method: PFP从离线数据提取偏好特征并训练分类器，在线学习时通过分布保留优化映射特征，最后将特征融入系统提示训练LLM。

Result: PFP成功减少在线学习中的特征偏差，在LLM对齐标准测试中优于先前方法。

Conclusion: PFP通过保留和利用偏好特征分布，显著提升了LLM偏好学习的性能。

Abstract: Recent preference learning frameworks for large language models (LLMs)
simplify human preferences with binary pairwise comparisons and scalar rewards.
This simplification could make LLMs' responses biased to mostly preferred
features, and would be exacerbated during the iterations of online preference
learning steps. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework
coined PFP (Preference Feature Preservation). The key idea of PFP is
maintaining the distribution of human preference features and utilizing such
rich signals throughout the online preference learning process. Specifically,
PFP first extract preference features from offline pairwise human preference
data and trains a feature classifier. Then, using trained classifier and the
distribution preserving optimization, PFP maps appropriate preference features
for a new input instruction during online learning. Lastly, PFP trains LLM
using the existing preference learning method, by incorporating the preference
feature into system prompts and enabling LLM to explicitly handle various human
preferences. Our experiments demonstrate that PFP successfully mitigates the
bias in preference features during online learning, and hence achieves superior
performance compared to previous preference learning methods on standard
benchmarks to evaluate LLM alignment.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs), structured as multi-relational data of entities and
relations, are vital for tasks like data analysis and recommendation systems.
Knowledge graph completion (KGC), or link prediction, addresses incompleteness
of KGs by inferring missing triples (h, r, t). It is vital for downstream
applications. Region-based embedding models usually embed entities as points
and relations as geometric regions to accomplish the task. Despite progress,
these models often overlook semantic hierarchies inherent in entities. To solve
this problem, we propose SectorE, a novel embedding model in polar coordinates.
Relations are modeled as annular sectors, combining modulus and phase to
capture inference patterns and relation attributes. Entities are embedded as
points within these sectors, intuitively encoding hierarchical structure.
Evaluated on FB15k-237, WN18RR, and YAGO3-10, SectorE achieves competitive
performance against various kinds of models, demonstrating strengths in
semantic modeling capability.

Abstract: Structure determination workloads in neutron diffractometry are
computationally expensive and routinely require several hours to many days to
determine the structure of a material from its neutron diffraction patterns.
The potential for machine learning models trained on simulated neutron
scattering patterns to significantly speed up these tasks have been reported
recently. However, the amount of simulated data needed to train these models
grows exponentially with the number of structural parameters to be predicted
and poses a significant computational challenge. To overcome this challenge, we
introduce a novel batch-mode active learning (AL) policy that uses uncertainty
sampling to simulate training data drawn from a probability distribution that
prefers labelled examples about which the model is least certain. We confirm
its efficacy in training the same models with about 75% less training data
while improving the accuracy. We then discuss the design of an efficient
stream-based training workflow that uses this AL policy and present a
performance study on two heterogeneous platforms to demonstrate that, compared
with a conventional training workflow, the streaming workflow delivers about
20% shorter training time without any loss of accuracy.

Conclusion: PromptTSS有效解决了多粒度时间序列分割问题，展示了在动态环境中的强大适应性。

Abstract: Multivariate time series data, collected across various fields such as
manufacturing and wearable technology, exhibit states at multiple levels of
granularity, from coarse-grained system behaviors to fine-grained, detailed
events. Effectively segmenting and integrating states across these different
granularities is crucial for tasks like predictive maintenance and performance
optimization. However, existing time series segmentation methods face two key
challenges: (1) the inability to handle multiple levels of granularity within a
unified model, and (2) limited adaptability to new, evolving patterns in
dynamic environments. To address these challenges, we propose PromptTSS, a
novel framework for time series segmentation with multi-granularity states.
PromptTSS uses a unified model with a prompting mechanism that leverages label
and boundary information to guide segmentation, capturing both coarse- and
fine-grained patterns while adapting dynamically to unseen patterns.
Experiments show PromptTSS improves accuracy by 24.49% in multi-granularity
segmentation, 17.88% in single-granularity segmentation, and up to 599.24% in
transfer learning, demonstrating its adaptability to hierarchical states and
evolving time series dynamics.

Motivation: 现有研究关注数据-策略覆盖以缓解分布偏移，但忽视了覆盖不足的安全风险，且单步分析与离线RL的多步决策特性不符。

Method: 引入序列级可集中系数量化覆盖，提出CSDPC攻击，通过识别并毒化罕见决策模式来降低覆盖。

Result: 实验显示毒化1%数据可使性能下降90%。

Conclusion: 研究为离线RL的安全分析和防护提供了新视角。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) heavily relies on the coverage of
pre-collected data over the target policy's distribution. Existing studies aim
to improve data-policy coverage to mitigate distributional shifts, but overlook
security risks from insufficient coverage, and the single-step analysis is not
consistent with the multi-step decision-making nature of offline RL. To address
this, we introduce the sequence-level concentrability coefficient to quantify
coverage, and reveal its exponential amplification on the upper bound of
estimation errors through theoretical analysis. Building on this, we propose
the Collapsing Sequence-Level Data-Policy Coverage (CSDPC) poisoning attack.
Considering the continuous nature of offline RL data, we convert state-action
pairs into decision units, and extract representative decision patterns that
capture multi-step behavior. We identify rare patterns likely to cause
insufficient coverage, and poison them to reduce coverage and exacerbate
distributional shifts. Experiments show that poisoning just 1% of the dataset
can degrade agent performance by 90%. This finding provides new perspectives
for analyzing and safeguarding the security of offline RL.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究利用监督机器学习方法（决策树、k-NN和朴素贝叶斯分类器）检测和缓解油气生产中的流动保障问题，特别是水合物形成，决策树算法表现最佳（准确率99.99%）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 油气生产中的管道堵塞等问题（如沉积、蜡沉积、矿物结垢和腐蚀）影响效率，需通过机器学习优化流体运输。

Method: 使用公开数据集（Petrobras 3W项目），通过数据预处理和清洗，利用scikit-learn库中的决策树、k-NN和朴素贝叶斯分类器进行分类任务。

Result: 决策树算法在预测水合物形成时准确率最高（99.99%），验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为优化生产效率提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Oil and gas reserves are vital resources for the global economy, serving as
key components in transportation, energy production, and industrial processes.
However, oil and gas extraction and production operations may encounter several
challenges, such as pipeline and production line blockages, caused by factors
including sediment accumulation, wax deposition, mineral scaling, and
corrosion. This study addresses these challenges by employing supervised
machine learning techniques, specifically decision trees, the k-Nearest
Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm (k-NN), and the Naive Bayes classifier method, to
detect and mitigate flow assurance challenges, ensuring efficient fluid
transport. The primary focus is on preventing gas hydrate formation in oil
production systems. To achieve this, data preprocessing and cleaning were
conducted to ensure the quality and consistency of the dataset, which was
sourced from Petrobras publicly available 3W project repository on GitHub. The
scikit-learn Python library, a widely recognized open-source tool for
supervised machine learning techniques, was utilized for classification tasks
due to its robustness and versatility. The results demonstrate that the
proposed methodology effectively classifies hydrate formation under operational
conditions, with the decision tree algorithm exhibiting the highest predictive
accuracy (99.99 percent). Consequently, this approach provides a reliable
solution for optimizing production efficiency.

Abstract: Introduction: Premature Ventricular Contractions (PVCs) are common cardiac
arrhythmias originating from the ventricles. Accurate detection remains
challenging due to variability in electrocardiogram (ECG) waveforms caused by
differences in lead placement, recording conditions, and population
demographics. Methods: We developed uPVC-Net, a universal deep learning model

from Holter monitors and a modern wearable ECG patch. uPVC-Net employs a custom
architecture and a multi-source, multi-lead training strategy. For each
experiment, one dataset is held out to evaluate out-of-distribution (OOD)
generalization. Results: uPVC-Net achieved an AUC between 97.8% and 99.1% on

Motivation: 研究动态决策系统中长期公平性的重要性，同时满足即时公平性要求，以解决传统公平性学习仅关注静态偏见的局限性。

Method: 提出一个通用框架，通过因果分解将长期公平性指标分为直接影响、延迟影响和虚假效应，并分析其与利益公平性的关系。

Result: 开发了一种简单有效的方法，能够平衡多种公平性概念，同时满足即时和长期公平性需求。

Conclusion: 该研究为动态决策系统中的公平性提供了新的视角和方法，强调了长期公平性与利益公平性的内在联系。

Abstract: Fairness-aware learning studies the development of algorithms that avoid
discriminatory decision outcomes despite biased training data. While most
studies have concentrated on immediate bias in static contexts, this paper
highlights the importance of investigating long-term fairness in dynamic
decision-making systems while simultaneously considering instantaneous fairness
requirements. In the context of reinforcement learning, we propose a general
framework where long-term fairness is measured by the difference in the average
expected qualification gain that individuals from different groups could
obtain.Then, through a causal lens, we decompose this metric into three
components that represent the direct impact, the delayed impact, as well as the
spurious effect the policy has on the qualification gain. We analyze the
intrinsic connection between these components and an emerging fairness notion
called benefit fairness that aims to control the equity of outcomes in
decision-making. Finally, we develop a simple yet effective approach for
balancing various fairness notions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文探讨了时间序列基础模型（TSFMs）在建筑能源管理（BEM）中的通用性，发现其表现有限，尤其在零样本预测和协变量处理方面不及传统统计模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有BEM解决方案依赖特定任务和数据模型，缺乏通用性。TSFMs有望像大语言模型（LLMs）一样实现跨任务和场景的通用性，但目前表现不足。

Method: 评估TSFMs在四个维度：零样本单变量预测、协变量预测、零样本表示学习和鲁棒性。

Result: TSFMs在零样本预测中表现略优于统计模型，但协变量处理能力不足，且对评估指标敏感。

Conclusion: TSFMs需改进协变量处理和上下文整合机制，以实现更通用的BEM解决方案。

Abstract: Building energy management (BEM) tasks require processing and learning from a
variety of time-series data. Existing solutions rely on bespoke task- and
data-specific models to perform these tasks, limiting their broader
applicability. Inspired by the transformative success of Large Language Models
(LLMs), Time-Series Foundation Models (TSFMs), trained on diverse datasets,
have the potential to change this. Were TSFMs to achieve a level of
generalizability across tasks and contexts akin to LLMs, they could
fundamentally address the scalability challenges pervasive in BEM. To
understand where they stand today, we evaluate TSFMs across four dimensions:
(1) generalizability in zero-shot univariate forecasting, (2) forecasting with
covariates for thermal behavior modeling, (3) zero-shot representation learning
for classification tasks, and (4) robustness to performance metrics and varying
operational conditions. Our results reveal that TSFMs exhibit \emph{limited}
generalizability, performing only marginally better than statistical models on
unseen datasets and modalities for univariate forecasting. Similarly, inclusion
of covariates in TSFMs does not yield performance improvements, and their
performance remains inferior to conventional models that utilize covariates.
While TSFMs generate effective zero-shot representations for downstream
classification tasks, they may remain inferior to statistical models in
forecasting when statistical models perform test-time fitting. Moreover, TSFMs
forecasting performance is sensitive to evaluation metrics, and they struggle
in more complex building environments compared to statistical models. These
findings underscore the need for targeted advancements in TSFM design,
particularly their handling of covariates and incorporating context and
temporal dynamics into prediction mechanisms, to develop more adaptable and
scalable solutions for BEM.

Abstract: Growing concerns over privacy, security, and legal barriers are driving the
rising demand for synthetic data across domains such as healthcare, finance,
and energy. While generative models offer a promising solution to overcome
these barriers, their utility depends on the incorporation of domain-specific
knowledge. We propose to synthesize data using a guided diffusion model that
integrates domain constraints directly into the generative process. We develop
the model in the context of power systems, with potential applicability to
other domains that involve tabular data. Specifically, we synthesize
statistically representative and high-fidelity power flow datasets. To satisfy
domain constraints, e.g., Kirchhoff laws, we introduce a gradient-based
guidance to steer the sampling trajectory in a feasible direction. Numerical
results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Motivation: 传统方法（如重加权或重采样）因未考虑多数类与少数类数据的多样性，容易过拟合且无法有效提升分类性能。

Method: 提出MOODS框架，结合多目标优化指导过采样和欠采样，并引入新的验证指标量化采样方法对模型性能的影响。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多样性驱动下，F1分数提高了1-15%，达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: MOODS框架和新验证指标有效解决了类别不平衡问题，显著提升了少数类的分类性能。

Abstract: Two-class classification problems are often characterized by an imbalance
between the number of majority and minority datapoints resulting in poor
classification of the minority class in particular. Traditional approaches,
such as reweighting the loss function or na\"ive resampling, risk overfitting
and subsequently fail to improve classification because they do not consider
the diversity between majority and minority datasets. Such consideration is
infeasible because there is no metric that can measure the impact of imbalance
on the model. To obviate these challenges, we make two key contributions.
First, we introduce MOODS~(Multi-Objective Optimization for Data Sampling), a
novel multi-objective bilevel optimization framework that guides both synthetic
oversampling and majority undersampling. Second, we introduce a validation
metric -- `$\epsilon/ \delta$ non-overlapping diversification metric' -- that
quantifies the goodness of a sampling method towards model performance. With
this metric we experimentally demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with
improvement in diversity driving a $1-15 \%$ increase in $F1$ scores.

Conclusion: ASNO通过增强可解释性和泛化能力，为科学机器学习提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In scientific machine learning (SciML), a key challenge is learning unknown,
evolving physical processes and making predictions across spatio-temporal
scales. For example, in real-world manufacturing problems like additive
manufacturing, users adjust known machine settings while unknown environmental
parameters simultaneously fluctuate. To make reliable predictions, it is
desired for a model to not only capture long-range spatio-temporal interactions
from data but also adapt to new and unknown environments; traditional machine
learning models excel at the first task but often lack physical
interpretability and struggle to generalize under varying environmental
conditions. To tackle these challenges, we propose the Attention-based
Spatio-Temporal Neural Operator (ASNO), a novel architecture that combines
separable attention mechanisms for spatial and temporal interactions and adapts
to unseen physical parameters. Inspired by the backward differentiation formula
(BDF), ASNO learns a transformer for temporal prediction and extrapolation and
an attention-based neural operator for handling varying external loads,
enhancing interpretability by isolating historical state contributions and
external forces, enabling the discovery of underlying physical laws and
generalizability to unseen physical environments. Empirical results on SciML
benchmarks demonstrate that ASNO outperforms over existing models, establishing
its potential for engineering applications, physics discovery, and
interpretable machine learning.

Conclusion: 结合两种方法可以同时适应多种问题结构，为参数自由的随机凸优化提供了样本和计算复杂度的分离。

Abstract: We study the sample complexity of stochastic convex optimization when problem
parameters, e.g., the distance to optimality, are unknown. We pursue two
strategies. First, we develop a reliable model selection method that avoids
overfitting the validation set. This method allows us to generically tune the
learning rate of stochastic optimization methods to match the optimal
known-parameter sample complexity up to $\log\log$ factors. Second, we develop
a regularization-based method that is specialized to the case that only the
distance to optimality is unknown. This method provides perfect adaptability to
unknown distance to optimality, demonstrating a separation between the sample
and computational complexity of parameter-free stochastic convex optimization.
Combining these two methods allows us to simultaneously adapt to multiple
problem structures.
  Experiments performing few-shot learning on CIFAR-10 by fine-tuning CLIP
models and prompt engineering Gemini to count shapes indicate that our reliable
model selection method can help mitigate overfitting to small validation sets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络常学习虚假相关性，导致泛化能力下降，现有方法依赖昂贵的外部注释或确定性模型，存在局限性。

Method: 通过二阶风险最小化和证据校准技术，量化模型预测证据，识别并抑制虚假相关性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提高了不同架构和数据模态下的组鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Evidential Alignment提供了一种无需虚假相关性注释的可扩展解决方案。

Abstract: Deep neural networks often learn and rely on spurious correlations, i.e.,
superficial associations between non-causal features and the targets. For
instance, an image classifier may identify camels based on the desert
backgrounds. While it can yield high overall accuracy during training, it
degrades generalization on more diverse scenarios where such correlations do
not hold. This problem poses significant challenges for out-of-distribution
robustness and trustworthiness. Existing methods typically mitigate this issue
by using external group annotations or auxiliary deterministic models to learn
unbiased representations. However, such information is costly to obtain, and
deterministic models may fail to capture the full spectrum of biases learned by
the models. To address these limitations, we propose Evidential Alignment, a
novel framework that leverages uncertainty quantification to understand the
behavior of the biased models without requiring group annotations. By
quantifying the evidence of model prediction with second-order risk
minimization and calibrating the biased models with the proposed evidential
calibration technique, Evidential Alignment identifies and suppresses spurious
correlations while preserving core features. We theoretically justify the
effectiveness of our method as capable of learning the patterns of biased
models and debiasing the model without requiring any spurious correlation
annotations. Empirical results demonstrate that our method significantly
improves group robustness across diverse architectures and data modalities,
providing a scalable and principled solution to spurious correlations.

Conclusion: LPK不仅恢复了过参数化神经网络的核回归界，还展示了神经网络相对于核方法的特征学习能力。

Abstract: Gradient-based optimization methods have shown remarkable empirical success,
yet their theoretical generalization properties remain only partially
understood. In this paper, we establish a generalization bound for gradient
flow that aligns with the classical Rademacher complexity bounds for kernel
methods-specifically those based on the RKHS norm and kernel trace-through a
data-dependent kernel called the loss path kernel (LPK). Unlike static kernels
such as NTK, the LPK captures the entire training trajectory, adapting to both
data and optimization dynamics, leading to tighter and more informative
generalization guarantees. Moreover, the bound highlights how the norm of the
training loss gradients along the optimization trajectory influences the final
generalization performance. The key technical ingredients in our proof combine
stability analysis of gradient flow with uniform convergence via Rademacher
complexity. Our bound recovers existing kernel regression bounds for
overparameterized neural networks and shows the feature learning capability of
neural networks compared to kernel methods. Numerical experiments on real-world
datasets validate that our bounds correlate well with the true generalization
gap.

Method: 提出三种EDN变体，分析节点度对标签噪声的影响，并在不同图数据集和算法上进行实验验证。

Result: 两种EDN变体导致图神经网络和噪声鲁棒算法的性能显著下降，统计验证了其重要性。

Conclusion: EDN模型应被纳入噪声鲁棒算法的评估中，以提高图学习在噪声环境中的可靠性。

Abstract: An important structural feature of a graph is its set of edges, as it
captures the relationships among the nodes (the graph's topology). Existing
node label noise models like Symmetric Label Noise (SLN) and Class Conditional
Noise (CCN) disregard this important node relationship in graph data; and the
Edge-Dependent Noise (EDN) model addresses this limitation. EDN posits that in
real-world scenarios, label noise may be influenced by the connections between
nodes. We explore three variants of EDN. A crucial notion that relates nodes
and edges in a graph is the degree of a node; we show that in all three
variants, the probability of a node's label corruption is dependent on its
degree. Additionally, we compare the dependence of these probabilities on node
degree across different variants. We performed experiments on popular graph
datasets using 5 different GNN architectures and 8 noise robust algorithms for
graph data. The results demonstrate that 2 variants of EDN lead to greater
performance degradation in both Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and existing
noise-robust algorithms, as compared to traditional node label noise models. We
statistically verify this by posing a suitable hypothesis-testing problem. This
emphasizes the importance of incorporating EDN when evaluating noise robust
algorithms for graphs, to enhance the reliability of graph-based learning in
noisy environments.

Conclusion: 随机性对生成性能的影响取决于分数误差的结构，需权衡误差纠正与放大。

Abstract: Sampling in score-based diffusion models can be performed by solving either a
probability flow ODE or a reverse-time stochastic differential equation (SDE)
parameterized by an arbitrary stochasticity parameter. In this work, we study
the effect of stochasticity on the generation process through bounds on the
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and complement the analysis with numerical and
analytical examples. Our results apply to general forward SDEs with additive
noise and Lipschitz-continuous score functions, and quantify how errors from
the prior distribution and score approximation propagate under different
choices of the stochasticity parameter. The theoretical bounds are derived
using log-Sobolev inequalities for the marginals of the forward process, which
enable a more effective control of the KL divergence decay along sampling. For
exact score functions, we find that stochasticity acts as an error-correcting
mechanism, decreasing KL divergence along the sampling trajectory. For an
approximate score function, there is a trade-off between error correction and
score error amplification, so that stochasticity can either improve or worsen
the performance, depending on the structure of the score error. Numerical
experiments on simple datasets and a fully analytical example are included to
illustrate and enlighten the theoretical results.

Abstract: This work presents a novel graph neural network (GNN) architecture, the
Feature-specific Interpretable Graph Neural Network (FIGNN), designed to
enhance the interpretability of deep learning surrogate models defined on
unstructured grids in scientific applications. Traditional GNNs often obscure
the distinct spatial influences of different features in multivariate
prediction tasks. FIGNN addresses this limitation by introducing a
feature-specific pooling strategy, which enables independent attribution of
spatial importance for each predicted variable. Additionally, a mask-based
regularization term is incorporated into the training objective to explicitly
encourage alignment between interpretability and predictive error, promoting
localized attribution of model performance. The method is evaluated for
surrogate modeling of two physically distinct systems: the SPEEDY atmospheric
circulation model and the backward-facing step (BFS) fluid dynamics benchmark.
Results demonstrate that FIGNN achieves competitive predictive performance
while revealing physically meaningful spatial patterns unique to each feature.
Analysis of rollout stability, feature-wise error budgets, and spatial mask
overlays confirm the utility of FIGNN as a general-purpose framework for
interpretable surrogate modeling in complex physical domains.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PEFT（如LoRA）在资源高效微调预训练大模型时，可能因依赖虚假标记（如SSTI）导致模型决策被操控。研究发现，少量虚假标记即可操控模型行为，且LoRA秩的大小影响模型对虚假标记的依赖程度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究PEFT方法在微调过程中可能存在的灾难性失败，特别是模型对虚假标记的依赖问题。

Method: 通过Seamless Spurious Token Injection（SSTI）在多个模型（Snowflake Arctic、Apple OpenELM、Meta LLaMA-3）和数据集（IMDB、Financial Classification等）上测试模型对虚假标记的依赖行为。

Result: 发现少量虚假标记即可操控模型决策；LoRA秩的大小与模型对虚假标记的依赖程度相关；高秩LoRA在强SSTI下更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PEFT方法需警惕虚假标记的潜在风险，LoRA秩的选择对模型鲁棒性有重要影响。

Abstract: Parameter Efficient FineTuning (PEFT), such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA),
aligns pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to particular downstream tasks
in a resource-efficient manner. Because efficiency has been the main metric of
progress, very little attention has been put in understanding possible
catastrophic failures. We uncover one such failure: PEFT encourages a model to
search for shortcut solutions to solve its fine-tuning tasks. When very small
amount of tokens, e.g., one token per prompt, are correlated with downstream
task classes, PEFT makes any pretrained model rely predominantly on that token
for decision making. While such spurious tokens may emerge accidentally from
incorrect data cleaning, it also opens opportunities for malevolent parties to
control a model's behavior from Seamless Spurious Token Injection (SSTI). In
SSTI, a small amount of tokens correlated with downstream classes are injected
by the dataset creators. At test time, the finetuned LLM's behavior can be
controlled solely by injecting those few tokens. We apply SSTI across models
from three families (Snowflake Arctic, Apple OpenELM, and Meta LLaMA-3) and
four diverse datasets (IMDB, Financial Classification, CommonSense QA, and Bias
in Bios). Our findings reveal three astonishing behaviors. First, as few as a
single token of SSTI is sufficient to steer a model's decision making. Second,
for light SSTI, the reliance on spurious tokens is proportional to the LoRA
rank. Lastly, with aggressive SSTI, larger LoRA rank values become preferable
to small rank values as it makes the model attend to non-spurious tokens, hence
improving robustness.

Motivation: 联邦学习中隐私泄露问题严重，现有研究多关注服务器端攻击，而忽视了客户端可能通过操纵梯度发起的数据重构攻击。

Method: 提出恶意好奇客户端威胁模型，结合梯度反演和恶意更新策略开发重构算法，并通过理论分析和实验验证其有效性。

Result: 实验表明，现有服务器端和客户端的防御机制可能无法抵御此类攻击，甚至可能加剧数据泄露。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了联邦学习中客户端攻击的新威胁，呼吁重新审视现有防御机制的设计。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables decentralized machine learning without
sharing raw data, allowing multiple clients to collaboratively learn a global
model. However, studies reveal that privacy leakage is possible under commonly
adopted FL protocols. In particular, a server with access to client gradients
can synthesize data resembling the clients' training data. In this paper, we
introduce a novel threat model in FL, named the maliciously curious client,
where a client manipulates its own gradients with the goal of inferring private
data from peers. This attacker uniquely exploits the strength of a Byzantine
adversary, traditionally aimed at undermining model robustness, and repurposes
it to facilitate data reconstruction attack. We begin by formally defining this
novel client-side threat model and providing a theoretical analysis that
demonstrates its ability to achieve significant reconstruction success during
FL training. To demonstrate its practical impact, we further develop a
reconstruction algorithm that combines gradient inversion with malicious update
strategies. Our analysis and experimental results reveal a critical blind spot
in FL defenses: both server-side robust aggregation and client-side privacy
mechanisms may fail against our proposed attack. Surprisingly, standard server-
and client-side defenses designed to enhance robustness or privacy may
unintentionally amplify data leakage. Compared to the baseline approach, a
mistakenly used defense may instead improve the reconstructed image quality by
10-15%.

Conclusion: RAG系统中的投毒攻击会直接放大模型输出偏见，需关注其公平性问题。

Abstract: In Large Language Models, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems can
significantly enhance the performance of large language models by integrating
external knowledge. However, RAG also introduces new security risks. Existing
research focuses mainly on how poisoning attacks in RAG systems affect model
output quality, overlooking their potential to amplify model biases. For
example, when querying about domestic violence victims, a compromised RAG
system might preferentially retrieve documents depicting women as victims,
causing the model to generate outputs that perpetuate gender stereotypes even
when the original query is gender neutral. To show the impact of the bias, this
paper proposes a Bias Retrieval and Reward Attack (BRRA) framework, which
systematically investigates attack pathways that amplify language model biases
through a RAG system manipulation. We design an adversarial document generation
method based on multi-objective reward functions, employ subspace projection
techniques to manipulate retrieval results, and construct a cyclic feedback
mechanism for continuous bias amplification. Experiments on multiple mainstream
large language models demonstrate that BRRA attacks can significantly enhance
model biases in dimensions. In addition, we explore a dual stage defense
mechanism to effectively mitigate the impacts of the attack. This study reveals
that poisoning attacks in RAG systems directly amplify model output biases and
clarifies the relationship between RAG system security and model fairness. This
novel potential attack indicates that we need to keep an eye on the fairness
issues of the RAG system.

Abstract: Designing protein-binding proteins with high affinity is critical in
biomedical research and biotechnology. Despite recent advancements targeting
specific proteins, the ability to create high-affinity binders for arbitrary
protein targets on demand, without extensive rounds of wet-lab testing, remains
a significant challenge. Here, we introduce PPDiff, a diffusion model to
jointly design the sequence and structure of binders for arbitrary protein
targets in a non-autoregressive manner. PPDiffbuilds upon our developed
Sequence Structure Interleaving Network with Causal attention layers (SSINC),
which integrates interleaved self-attention layers to capture global amino acid
correlations, k-nearest neighbor (kNN) equivariant graph layers to model local
interactions in three-dimensional (3D) space, and causal attention layers to
simplify the intricate interdependencies within the protein sequence. To assess
PPDiff, we curate PPBench, a general protein-protein complex dataset comprising
706,360 complexes from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The model is pretrained on
PPBenchand finetuned on two real-world applications: target-protein mini-binder
complex design and antigen-antibody complex design. PPDiffconsistently
surpasses baseline methods, achieving success rates of 50.00%, 23.16%, and
16.89% for the pretraining task and the two downstream applications,

Abstract: The deployment of deep neural networks on edge devices is a challenging task
due to the increasing complexity of state-of-the-art models, requiring efforts
to reduce model size and inference latency. Recent studies explore models
operating at diverse quantization settings to find the optimal point that
balances computational efficiency and accuracy. Truncation, an effective
approach for achieving lower bit precision mapping, enables a single model to
adapt to various hardware platforms with little to no cost. However,
formulating a training scheme for deep neural networks to withstand the
associated errors introduced by truncation remains a challenge, as the current
quantization-aware training schemes are not designed for the truncation
process. We propose TruncQuant, a novel truncation-ready training scheme
allowing flexible bit precision through bit-shifting in runtime. We achieve
this by aligning TruncQuant with the output of the truncation process,
demonstrating strong robustness across bit-width settings, and offering an
easily implementable training scheme within existing quantization-aware
frameworks. Our code is released at https://github.com/a2jinhee/TruncQuant.

Conclusion: DynaDiag在保持性能的同时显著提升了计算效率，适用于硬件友好的稀疏训练。

Abstract: Recent advances in Dynamic Sparse Training (DST) have pushed the frontier of
sparse neural network training in structured and unstructured contexts,
matching dense-model performance while drastically reducing parameter counts to
facilitate model scaling. However, unstructured sparsity often fails to
translate into practical speedups on modern hardware. To address this
shortcoming, we propose DynaDiag, a novel structured sparse-to-sparse DST
method that performs at par with unstructured sparsity. DynaDiag enforces a
diagonal sparsity pattern throughout training and preserves sparse computation
in forward and backward passes. We further leverage the diagonal structure to
accelerate computation via a custom CUDA kernel, rendering the method
hardware-friendly. Empirical evaluations on diverse neural architectures
demonstrate that our method maintains accuracy on par with unstructured
counterparts while benefiting from tangible computational gains. Notably, with
90% sparse linear layers in ViTs, we observe up to a 3.13x speedup in online
inference without sacrificing model performance and a 1.59x speedup in training
on a GPU compared to equivalent unstructured layers. Our source code is

Motivation: 多模态学习中动态融合策略（如注意力机制）因模型偏好某一模态而失效，导致动态适应性下降。

Method: 提出RollingQ方法，通过旋转查询平衡注意力分配，打破自增强循环并缩小键分布差距。

Result: 实验验证RollingQ有效恢复多模态Transformer的动态适应性，提升性能。

Conclusion: RollingQ方法简单有效，为广泛部署的多模态Transformer提供了动态适应性的恢复方案。

Abstract: Multimodal learning faces challenges in effectively fusing information from
diverse modalities, especially when modality quality varies across samples.
Dynamic fusion strategies, such as attention mechanism in Transformers, aim to
address such challenge by adaptively emphasizing modalities based on the
characteristics of input data. However, through amounts of carefully designed
experiments, we surprisingly observed that the dynamic adaptability of
widely-used self-attention models diminishes. Model tends to prefer one
modality regardless of data characteristics. This bias triggers a
self-reinforcing cycle that progressively overemphasizes the favored modality,
widening the distribution gap in attention keys across modalities and
deactivating attention mechanism's dynamic properties. To revive adaptability,
we propose a simple yet effective method Rolling Query (RollingQ), which
balances attention allocation by rotating the query to break the
self-reinforcing cycle and mitigate the key distribution gap. Extensive
experiments on various multimodal scenarios validate the effectiveness of
RollingQ and the restoration of cooperation dynamics is pivotal for enhancing
the broader capabilities of widely deployed multimodal Transformers. The source
code is available at https://github.com/GeWu-Lab/RollingQ_ICML2025.

Method: 提出基于梯度对齐的LearnAlign方法，通过数据可学习性（基于成功率）选择代表性训练数据，避免响应长度偏差。

Result: 在三个数学推理基准测试中，该方法显著减少训练数据需求，性能接近或优于全数据训练（如GSM8K基准上减少1000数据点，性能提升至77.53%）。

Conclusion: LearnAlign为数据高效的RL后训练提供了新思路，并为未来优化推理数据选择的研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a key technique for enhancing LLMs'
reasoning abilities, yet its data inefficiency remains a major bottleneck. To
address this critical yet challenging issue, we present a novel
gradient-alignment-based method, named LearnAlign, which intelligently selects
the learnable and representative training reasoning data for RL post-training.
To overcome the well-known issue of response-length bias in gradient norms, we
introduce the data learnability based on the success rate, which can indicate
the learning potential of each data point. Experiments across three
mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly
reduces training data requirements while achieving minor performance
degradation or even improving performance compared to full-data training. For
example, it reduces data requirements by up to 1,000 data points with better
performance (77.53%) than that on the full dataset on GSM8K benchmark (77.04%).
Furthermore, we show its effectiveness in the staged RL setting. This work
provides valuable insights into data-efficient RL post-training and establishes
a foundation for future research in optimizing reasoning data selection.To

Abstract: Diabetes has emerged as a significant global health issue, especially with
the increasing number of cases in many countries. This trend Underlines the
need for a greater emphasis on early detection and proactive management to

Conclusion: 机器学习可提供客观的VUR评估方法，未来需扩大数据集并优化模型。

Abstract: Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is traditionally assessed using subjective
grading systems, which introduces variability in diagnosis. This study
investigates the use of machine learning to improve diagnostic consistency by
analyzing voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) images. A total of 113 VCUG images
were reviewed, with expert grading of VUR severity. Nine image-based features
were selected to train six predictive models: Logistic Regression, Decision
Tree, Gradient Boosting, Neural Network, and Stochastic Gradient Descent. The
models were evaluated using leave-one-out cross-validation. Analysis identified
deformation patterns in the renal calyces as key indicators of high-grade VUR.
All models achieved accurate classifications with no false positives or
negatives. High sensitivity to subtle image patterns characteristic of
different VUR grades was confirmed by substantial Area Under the Curve (AUC)
values. The results suggest that machine learning can offer an objective and
standardized alternative to current subjective VUR assessments. These findings
highlight renal calyceal deformation as a strong predictor of severe cases.
Future research should aim to expand the dataset, refine imaging features, and
improve model generalizability for broader clinical use.

Conclusion: 论文通过任务驱动视角为DRL提供了新的研究思路，并验证了离散表示在实际任务中的潜力。

Abstract: In recent years, deep discrete representation learning (DRL) has achieved
significant success across various domains. Most DRL frameworks (e.g., the
widely used VQ-VAE and its variants) have primarily focused on generative
settings, where the quality of a representation is implicitly gauged by the
fidelity of its generation. In fact, the goodness of a discrete representation
remain ambiguously defined across the literature. In this work, we adopt a
practical approach that examines DRL from a task-driven perspective. We propose
a unified framework that explores the usefulness of discrete features in
relation to downstream tasks, with generation naturally viewed as one possible
application. In this context, the properties of discrete representations as
well as the way they benefit certain tasks are also relatively understudied. We
therefore provide an additional theoretical analysis of the trade-off between
representational capacity and sample complexity, shedding light on how discrete
representation utilization impacts task performance. Finally, we demonstrate
the flexibility and effectiveness of our framework across diverse applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled unprecedented
capabilities for time-series reasoning in diverse real-world applications,
including medical, financial, and spatio-temporal domains. However, existing
approaches typically focus on task-specific model customization, such as
forecasting and anomaly detection, while overlooking the data itself, referred
to as time-series primitives, which are essential for in-depth reasoning. This
position paper advocates a fundamental shift in approaching time-series
reasoning with LLMs: prioritizing alignment paradigms grounded in the intrinsic
primitives of time series data over task-specific model customization. This
realignment addresses the core limitations of current time-series reasoning
approaches, which are often costly, inflexible, and inefficient, by
systematically accounting for intrinsic structure of data before task
engineering. To this end, we propose three alignment paradigms: Injective
Alignment, Bridging Alignment, and Internal Alignment, which are emphasized by
prioritizing different aspects of time-series primitives: domain,
characteristic, and representation, respectively, to activate time-series
reasoning capabilities of LLMs to enable economical, flexible, and efficient
reasoning. We further recommend that practitioners adopt an alignment-oriented
method to avail this instruction to select an appropriate alignment paradigm.
Additionally, we categorize relevant literature into these alignment paradigms
and outline promising research directions.

Conclusion: 首次将推理时的注意力机制形式化为蒸馏过程，为未来的提示工程和自动演示选择提供了理论依据。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) allows large language models (LLMs) to solve novel
tasks without weight updates. Despite its empirical success, the mechanism
behind ICL remains poorly understood, limiting our ability to interpret,
improve, and reliably apply it. In this paper, we propose a new theoretical
perspective that interprets ICL as an implicit form of knowledge distillation
(KD), where prompt demonstrations guide the model to form a task-specific
reference model during inference. Under this view, we derive a Rademacher
complexity-based generalization bound and prove that the bias of the distilled
weights grows linearly with the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between the
prompt and target distributions. This theoretical framework explains several
empirical phenomena and unifies prior gradient-based and distributional
analyses. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first to formalize
inference-time attention as a distillation process, which provides theoretical
insights for future prompt engineering and automated demonstration selection.

Conclusion: Delayformer为解决高维时间序列预测问题提供了有效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Predicting time-series is of great importance in various scientific and
engineering fields. However, in the context of limited and noisy data,
accurately predicting dynamics of all variables in a high-dimensional system is
a challenging task due to their nonlinearity and also complex interactions.
Current methods including deep learning approaches often perform poorly for
real-world systems under such circumstances. This study introduces the
Delayformer framework for simultaneously predicting dynamics of all variables,
by developing a novel multivariate spatiotemporal information (mvSTI)
transformation that makes each observed variable into a delay-embedded state
(vector) and further cross-learns those states from different variables. From
dynamical systems viewpoint, Delayformer predicts system states rather than
individual variables, thus theoretically and computationally overcoming such
nonlinearity and cross-interaction problems. Specifically, it first utilizes a
single shared Visual Transformer (ViT) encoder to cross-represent dynamical
states from observed variables in a delay embedded form and then employs
distinct linear decoders for predicting next states, i.e. equivalently
predicting all original variables parallelly. By leveraging the theoretical
foundations of delay embedding theory and the representational capabilities of
Transformers, Delayformer outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in
forecasting tasks on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Furthermore, the
potential of Delayformer as a foundational time-series model is demonstrated
through cross-domain forecasting tasks, highlighting its broad applicability
across various scenarios.

Abstract: State estimation or filtering serves as a fundamental task to enable
intelligent decision-making in applications such as autonomous vehicles,
robotics, healthcare monitoring, smart grids, intelligent transportation, and
predictive maintenance. Standard filtering assumes prior knowledge of noise
statistics to extract latent system states from noisy sensor data. However,
real-world scenarios involve abnormalities like outliers, biases, drifts, and
missing observations with unknown or partially known statistics, limiting
conventional approaches. This thesis presents novel robust nonlinear filtering
methods to mitigate these challenges. Based on insights from our filtering
proposals, we extend the formulations to offline estimation/learning setups and
propose smoothing extensions. Our methods leverage Bayesian inference
frameworks, employing both deterministic and stochastic approximation
techniques including Variational Inference (VI) and Particle Filters/Sequential
Monte Carlo (SMC). We also study theoretical estimation limits using Bayesian
Cram\'er-Rao bounds (BCRBs) in the context of measurement abnormalities. To
validate the performance gains of the proposed methods, we perform simulations
and experiments in scenarios including target tracking, indoor localization, 3D
point cloud registration, mesh registration, and pose graph optimization. The
fundamental nature of the work makes it useful in diverse applications, with
possible future extensions toward developing outlier-robust machine learning
pipelines, learning system dynamics from anomalous data, and addressing
challenges in generative AI where standard diffusion models struggle with
outliers, imbalanced datasets, and mode collapse.

Abstract: Different modalities hold considerable gaps in optimization trajectories,
including speeds and paths, which lead to modality laziness and modality clash
when jointly training multimodal models, resulting in insufficient and
imbalanced multimodal learning. Existing methods focus on enforcing the weak
modality by adding modality-specific optimization objectives, aligning their
optimization speeds, or decomposing multimodal learning to enhance unimodal
learning. These methods fail to achieve both unimodal sufficiency and
multimodal balance. In this paper, we, for the first time, address both
concerns by proposing multimodal Data Remixing, including decoupling multimodal
data and filtering hard samples for each modality to mitigate modality
imbalance; and then batch-level reassembling to align the gradient directions
and avoid cross-modal interference, thus enhancing unimodal learning
sufficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can be seamlessly
integrated with existing approaches, improving accuracy by approximately
6.50%$\uparrow$ on CREMAD and 3.41%$\uparrow$ on Kinetic-Sounds, without
training set expansion or additional computational overhead during inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基础模型在泛化与个性化之间存在矛盾，联邦基础模型通过去中心化过程分离共享知识与个体适配，为解决这一问题提供了结构化的方法。

Method: 采用联邦基础模型（FFM），在推荐系统中利用丰富的隐式反馈，设计既能泛化又能保护用户个性完整性的学习范式。

Result: 提出了一种用户中心、去中心化的架构，未来可能通过个性化自适应基础模型驱动个人代理，指导用户内容决策。

Conclusion: 联邦基础模型为推荐系统提供了一种既能泛化又能保护用户个性的解决方案，未来有望实现用户控制的个性化代理系统。

Abstract: A core learning challenge for existed Foundation Models (FM) is striking the
tradeoff between generalization with personalization, which is a dilemma that
has been highlighted by various parameter-efficient adaptation techniques.
Federated foundation models (FFM) provide a structural means to decouple shared
knowledge from individual specific adaptations via decentralized processes.
Recommendation systems offer a perfect testbed for FFMs, given their reliance
on rich implicit feedback reflecting unique user characteristics. This position
paper discusses a novel learning paradigm where FFMs not only harness their
generalization capabilities but are specifically designed to preserve the
integrity of user personality, illustrated thoroughly within the recommendation
contexts. We envision future personal agents, powered by personalized adaptive
FMs, guiding user decisions on content. Such an architecture promises a user
centric, decentralized system where individuals maintain control over their
personalized agents.

TL;DR: 本文比较了基于影响力的信号在调试训练数据中的效果，发现现有信号能有效检测错误标签样本，但无法检测异常样本，且存在训练动态和影响力抵消效应的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高训练样本质量对提升机器学习模型的可靠性和性能至关重要，本文旨在评估不同影响力信号在检测训练数据问题（如错误标签和异常样本）中的效果。

Method: 通过实验比较多种影响力信号（如自影响力、平均绝对影响力等）在不同数据模态（图像和表格）和深度学习模型中的表现，使用共同的影响力估计器（如TraceIn）。

Result: 实验表明，自影响力能有效检测错误标签样本，但现有信号均无法检测异常样本，且存在训练动态和影响力抵消效应的问题。

Conclusion: 现有影响力信号在检测训练数据问题时存在局限性，需进一步改进以考虑训练动态和避免影响力抵消效应。

Abstract: Improving the quality of training samples is crucial for improving the
reliability and performance of ML models. In this paper, we conduct a
comparative evaluation of influence-based signals for debugging training data.
These signals can potentially identify both mislabeled and anomalous samples
from a potentially noisy training set as we build the models and hence
alleviate the need for dedicated glitch detectors. Although several
influence-based signals (e.g., Self-Influence, Average Absolute Influence,
Marginal Influence, GD-class) have been recently proposed in the literature,
there are no experimental studies for assessing their power in detecting
different glitch types (e.g., mislabeled and anomalous samples) under a common
influence estimator (e.g., TraceIn) for different data modalities (image and
tabular), and deep learning models (trained from scratch or foundation).
Through extensive experiments, we show that signals like Self-Influence
effectively detect mislabeled samples, but none of the existing signals can
detect anomalies. Existing signals do not take into account the training
dynamics, i.e., how the samples' influence on the model changes during
training, while some signals fall into influence cancellation effects, i.e.,
influence score is zero due to unsigned scores accumulation, resulting in
misleading influence attribution.

*Yaning Jia,Shenyang Deng,Chiyu Ma,Yaoqing Yang,Soroush Vosoughi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图核复杂度的边净化方法（KCES），用于提升图神经网络（GNN）的鲁棒性，无需训练且模型无关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管GNN在许多任务中表现优异，但其对微小扰动和对抗攻击的脆弱性仍未解决。现有防御方法多依赖启发式指标，易过拟合且计算复杂。

Method: 提出Graph Kernel Complexity（GKC）作为衡量GNN泛化能力的指标，并基于此定义边的重要性分数（KC score），通过剪枝高分数边来防御攻击。

Result: KCES显著提升了GNN的鲁棒性，优于现有方法，并能与现有防御策略无缝集成。

Conclusion: KCES为GNN提供了一种高效且理论支持的防御方案。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved impressive success across a wide
range of graph-based tasks, yet they remain highly vulnerable to small,
imperceptible perturbations and adversarial attacks. Although numerous defense
methods have been proposed to address these vulnerabilities, many rely on
heuristic metrics, overfit to specific attack patterns, and suffer from high
computational complexity. In this paper, we propose Kernel Complexity-Based
Edge Sanitization (KCES), a training-free, model-agnostic defense framework.
KCES leverages Graph Kernel Complexity (GKC), a novel metric derived from the
graph's Gram matrix that characterizes GNN generalization via its test error
bound. Building on GKC, we define a KC score for each edge, measuring the
change in GKC when the edge is removed. Edges with high KC scores, typically
introduced by adversarial perturbations, are pruned to mitigate their harmful
effects, thereby enhancing GNNs' robustness. KCES can also be seamlessly
integrated with existing defense strategies as a plug-and-play module without
requiring training. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate
that KCES consistently enhances GNN robustness, outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, and amplifies the effectiveness of existing defenses, offering a
principled and efficient solution for securing GNNs.

TL;DR: 研究发现，在狭窄有害数据集上微调大型语言模型会导致广泛的对齐失败（Emergent Misalignment, EM），专家对此感到意外。研究通过新数据集和改进方法，实现了更高的模型一致性，并在更小模型上验证了EM现象。

Motivation: 揭示模型对齐的潜在风险，填补对大型语言模型对齐机制理解的空白。

Method: 使用新的狭窄不对齐数据集，改进模型生物体，验证EM现象在不同模型规模和训练协议下的鲁棒性。

Result: 实现了99%的模型一致性（之前为67%），在0.5B参数模型上验证了EM现象，并发现了一个机制性相变。

Conclusion: 研究为未来理解和缓解LLM对齐风险奠定了基础，揭示了当前对齐方法的不足。

Abstract: Recent work discovered Emergent Misalignment (EM): fine-tuning large language
models on narrowly harmful datasets can lead them to become broadly misaligned.
A survey of experts prior to publication revealed this was highly unexpected,
demonstrating critical gaps in our understanding of model alignment. In this
work, we both advance understanding and provide tools for future research.
Using new narrowly misaligned datasets, we create a set of improved model
organisms that achieve 99% coherence (vs. 67% prior), work with smaller 0.5B
parameter models (vs. 32B), and that induce misalignment using a single rank-1
LoRA adapter. We demonstrate that EM occurs robustly across diverse model
sizes, three model families, and numerous training protocols including full
supervised fine-tuning. Leveraging these cleaner model organisms, we isolate a
mechanistic phase transition and demonstrate that it corresponds to a robust
behavioural phase transition in all studied organisms. Aligning large language
models is critical for frontier AI safety, yet EM exposes how far we are from
achieving this robustly. By distilling clean model organisms that isolate a
minimal alignment-compromising change, and where this is learnt, we establish a
foundation for future research into understanding and mitigating alignment
risks in LLMs.

Result: 在CIFAR-10和语音识别任务中，准确率提升约10%，重新训练时间减少47%。

Conclusion: 该框架无需完整重新训练或显式噪声建模，在噪声环境中实现了鲁棒的泛化性能。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse
domains, but their performance can be severely degraded by noisy or corrupted
training data. Conventional noise mitigation methods often rely on explicit
assumptions about noise distributions or require extensive retraining, which
can be impractical for large-scale models. Inspired by the principles of
machine unlearning, we propose a novel framework that integrates
attribution-guided data partitioning, discriminative neuron pruning, and
targeted fine-tuning to mitigate the impact of noisy samples. Our approach
employs gradient-based attribution to probabilistically distinguish
high-quality examples from potentially corrupted ones without imposing
restrictive assumptions on the noise. It then applies regression-based
sensitivity analysis to identify and prune neurons that are most vulnerable to
noise. Finally, the resulting network is fine-tuned on the high-quality data
subset to efficiently recover and enhance its generalization performance. This
integrated unlearning-inspired framework provides several advantages over
conventional noise-robust learning approaches. Notably, it combines data-level
unlearning with model-level adaptation, thereby avoiding the need for full
model retraining or explicit noise modeling. We evaluate our method on
representative tasks (e.g., CIFAR-10 image classification and speech
recognition) under various noise levels and observe substantial gains in both
accuracy and efficiency. For example, our framework achieves approximately a
10% absolute accuracy improvement over standard retraining on CIFAR-10 with
injected label noise, while reducing retraining time by up to 47% in some
settings. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of the
proposed approach for achieving robust generalization in noisy environments.

Result: 发现不同失调模型收敛到相似的表示，并成功通过‘失调方向’消除其他模型的失调行为。

Conclusion: 研究为理解并缓解模型失调提供了新视角，有助于更广泛的对齐问题研究。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models on narrow datasets can cause them to
develop broadly misaligned behaviours: a phenomena known as emergent
misalignment. However, the mechanisms underlying this misalignment, and why it
generalizes beyond the training domain, are poorly understood, demonstrating
critical gaps in our knowledge of model alignment. In this work, we train and
study a minimal model organism which uses just 9 rank-1 adapters to emergently
misalign Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct. Studying this, we find that different emergently
misaligned models converge to similar representations of misalignment. We
demonstrate this convergence by extracting a 'misalignment direction' from one
fine-tuned model's activations, and using it to effectively ablate misaligned
behaviour from fine-tunes using higher dimensional LoRAs and different
datasets. Leveraging the scalar hidden state of rank-1 LoRAs, we further
present a set of experiments for directly interpreting the fine-tuning
adapters, showing that six contribute to general misalignment, while two
specialise for misalignment in just the fine-tuning domain. Emergent
misalignment is a particularly salient example of undesirable and unexpected
model behaviour and by advancing our understanding of the mechanisms behind it,
we hope to move towards being able to better understand and mitigate
misalignment more generally.

Abstract: The relative balance between physics and data within any physics-informed
machine learner is an important modelling consideration to ensure that the
benefits of both physics and data-based approaches are maximised. An over
reliance on physical knowledge can be detrimental, particularly when the
physics-based component of a model may not accurately represent the true
underlying system. An underutilisation of physical knowledge potentially wastes
a valuable resource, along with benefits in model interpretability and reduced
demand for expensive data collection. Achieving an optimal physics-data balance
is a challenging aspect of model design, particularly if the level varies
through time; for example, one might have a physical approximation, only valid
within particular regimes, or a physical phenomenon may be known to only occur
when given conditions are met (e.g. at high temperatures). This paper develops
novel, physically-informed, change-point kernels for Gaussian processes,
capable of dynamically varying the reliance upon available physical knowledge.
A high level of control is granted to a user, allowing for the definition of
conditions in which they believe a phenomena should occur and the rate at which
the knowledge should be phased in and out of a model. In circumstances where
users may be less certain, the switching reliance upon physical knowledge may
be automatically learned and recovered from the model in an interpretable and
intuitive manner. Variation of the modelled noise based on the physical
phenomena occurring is also implemented to provide a more representative
capture of uncertainty alongside predictions. The capabilities of the new
kernel structures are explored through the use of two engineering case studies:
the directional wind loading of a cable-stayed bridge and the prediction of
aircraft wing strain during in-flight manoeuvring.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown significant success for graph-based
tasks. Motivated by the prevalence of large datasets in real-world
applications, pooling layers are crucial components of GNNs. By reducing the
size of input graphs, pooling enables faster training and potentially better
generalisation. However, existing pooling operations often optimise for the
learning task at the expense of fundamental graph structures and
interpretability. This leads to unreliable performance across varying dataset
types, downstream tasks and pooling ratios. Addressing these concerns, we
propose novel graph pooling layers for structure aware pooling via edge
collapses. Our methods leverage diffusion geometry and iteratively reduce a
graph's size while preserving both its metric structure and structural
diversity. We guide pooling using magnitude, an isometry-invariant diversity
measure, which permits us to control the fidelity of the pooling process.
Further, we use the spread of a metric space as a faster and more stable
alternative ensuring computational efficiency. Empirical results demonstrate
that our methods (i) achieve superior performance compared to alternative
pooling layers across a range of diverse graph classification tasks, (ii)
preserve key spectral properties of the input graphs, and (iii) retain high
accuracy across varying pooling ratios.

Result: 在MiniHack和Mujoco实验中，GrowNN性能优于静态网络，提升幅度达48%至72%。

Conclusion: GrowNN能有效提升强化学习模型的性能和训练效率。

Abstract: While increasingly large models have revolutionized much of the machine
learning landscape, training even mid-sized networks for Reinforcement Learning
(RL) is still proving to be a struggle. This, however, severely limits the
complexity of policies we are able to learn. To enable increased network
capacity while maintaining network trainability, we propose GrowNN, a simple
yet effective method that utilizes progressive network growth during training.
We start training a small network to learn an initial policy. Then we add
layers without changing the encoded function. Subsequent updates can utilize
the added layers to learn a more expressive policy, adding capacity as the
policy's complexity increases. GrowNN can be seamlessly integrated into most
existing RL agents. Our experiments on MiniHack and Mujoco show improved agent
performance, with incrementally GrowNN-deeper networks outperforming their
respective static counterparts of the same size by up to 48% on MiniHack Room
and 72% on Ant.

Conclusion: 灵活的降维矩阵设计能优化图粗化效果，为图信号处理与机器学习提供新思路。

Abstract: Graph coarsening aims to diminish the size of a graph to lighten its memory
footprint, and has numerous applications in graph signal processing and machine
learning. It is usually defined using a reduction matrix and a lifting matrix,
which, respectively, allows to project a graph signal from the original graph
to the coarsened one and back. This results in a loss of information measured
by the so-called Restricted Spectral Approximation (RSA). Most coarsening
frameworks impose a fixed relationship between the reduction and lifting
matrices, generally as pseudo-inverses of each other, and seek to define a
coarsening that minimizes the RSA. In this paper, we remark that the roles of
these two matrices are not entirely symmetric: indeed, putting constraints on
the lifting matrix alone ensures the existence of important objects such as the
coarsened graph's adjacency matrix or Laplacian. In light of this, in this
paper, we introduce a more general notion of reduction matrix, that is not
necessarily the pseudo-inverse of the lifting matrix. We establish a taxonomy
of ``admissible'' families of reduction matrices, discuss the different
properties that they must satisfy and whether they admit a closed-form
description or not. We show that, for a fixed coarsening represented by a fixed
lifting matrix, the RSA can be further reduced simply by modifying the
reduction matrix. We explore different examples, including some based on a
constrained optimization process of the RSA. Since this criterion has also been
linked to the performance of Graph Neural Networks, we also illustrate the
impact of this choices on different node classification tasks on coarsened
graphs.

Conclusion: SSPINNpose为实验室和野外环境提供可扩展、适应性强的实时生物力学分析解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate real-time estimation of human movement dynamics, including internal
joint moments and muscle forces, is essential for applications in clinical
diagnostics and sports performance monitoring. Inertial measurement units
(IMUs) provide a minimally intrusive solution for capturing motion data,
particularly when used in sparse sensor configurations. However, current
real-time methods rely on supervised learning, where a ground truth dataset
needs to be measured with laboratory measurement systems, such as optical
motion capture. These systems are known to introduce measurement and processing
errors and often fail to generalize to real-world or previously unseen
movements, necessitating new data collection efforts that are time-consuming
and impractical. To overcome these limitations, we propose SSPINNpose, a
self-supervised, physics-informed neural network that estimates joint
kinematics and kinetics directly from IMU data, without requiring ground truth
labels for training. We run the network output through a physics model of the
human body to optimize physical plausibility and generate virtual measurement
data. Using this virtual sensor data, the network is trained directly on the
measured sensor data instead of a ground truth. When compared to optical motion
capture, SSPINNpose is able to accurately estimate joint angles and joint
moments at an RMSD of 8.7 deg and 4.9 BWBH%, respectively, for walking and
running at speeds up to 4.9 m/s at a latency of 3.5 ms. Furthermore, the
framework demonstrates robustness across sparse sensor configurations and can
infer the anatomical locations of the sensors. These results underscore the
potential of SSPINNpose as a scalable and adaptable solution for real-time
biomechanical analysis in both laboratory and field environments.

Motivation: 探讨特征归因方法评估的可靠性，特别是在缺乏真实标签时，扰动分析是否有效。

Method: 使用合成时间序列数据，系统变化特征类型和类别对比，比较扰动和真实标签的评估结果。

Result: 发现类别依赖效应普遍存在，扰动和真实评估方法结果常矛盾，相关性弱。

Conclusion: 建议谨慎解释扰动评估结果，需开发更全面的评估框架。

Abstract: Evaluating feature attribution methods represents a critical challenge in
explainable AI (XAI), as researchers typically rely on perturbation-based
metrics when ground truth is unavailable. However, recent work demonstrates
that these evaluation metrics can show different performance across predicted
classes within the same dataset. These "class-dependent evaluation effects"
raise questions about whether perturbation analysis reliably measures
attribution quality, with direct implications for XAI method development and
the trustworthiness of evaluation techniques. We investigate under which
conditions these class-dependent effects arise by conducting controlled
experiments with synthetic time series data where ground truth feature
locations are known. We systematically vary feature types and class contrasts
across binary classification tasks, then compare perturbation-based degradation
scores with ground truth-based precision-recall metrics using multiple
attribution methods. Our experiments demonstrate that class-dependent effects
emerge with both evaluation approaches even in simple scenarios with temporally
localized features, triggered by basic variations in feature amplitude or
temporal extent between classes. Most critically, we find that
perturbation-based and ground truth metrics frequently yield contradictory
assessments of attribution quality across classes, with weak correlations
between evaluation approaches. These findings suggest that researchers should
interpret perturbation-based metrics with care, as they may not always align
with whether attributions correctly identify discriminating features. These
findings reveal opportunities to reconsider what attribution evaluation
actually measures and to develop more comprehensive evaluation frameworks that
capture multiple dimensions of attribution quality.

Conclusion: SEC-bench揭示了LLM代理在安全工程中的性能差距，为未来发展指明了方向。

Abstract: Rigorous security-focused evaluation of large language model (LLM) agents is
imperative for establishing trust in their safe deployment throughout the
software development lifecycle. However, existing benchmarks largely rely on
synthetic challenges or simplified vulnerability datasets that fail to capture
the complexity and ambiguity encountered by security engineers in practice. We
introduce SEC-bench, the first fully automated benchmarking framework for
evaluating LLM agents on authentic security engineering tasks. SEC-bench
employs a novel multi-agent scaffold that automatically constructs code
repositories with harnesses, reproduces vulnerabilities in isolated
environments, and generates gold patches for reliable evaluation. Our framework
automatically creates high-quality software vulnerability datasets with
reproducible artifacts at a cost of only $0.87 per instance. Using SEC-bench,
we implement two critical software security tasks to rigorously evaluate LLM
agents' capabilities: proof-of-concept (PoC) generation and vulnerability
patching. A comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLM code agents
reveals significant performance gaps, achieving at most 18.0% success in PoC
generation and 34.0% in vulnerability patching on our complete dataset. These
results highlight the crucial steps needed toward developing LLM agents that
are more practical, intelligent, and autonomous for security engineering.

Abstract: Inspired by the success of large language models (LLMs), there is a
significant research shift from traditional graph learning methods to LLM-based
graph frameworks, formally known as GraphLLMs. GraphLLMs leverage the reasoning
power of LLMs by integrating three key components: the textual attributes of
input nodes, the structural information of node neighborhoods, and
task-specific prompts that guide decision-making. Despite their promise, the
robustness of GraphLLMs against adversarial perturbations remains largely
unexplored-a critical concern for deploying these models in high-stakes
scenarios. To bridge the gap, we introduce TrustGLM, a comprehensive study
evaluating the vulnerability of GraphLLMs to adversarial attacks across three
dimensions: text, graph structure, and prompt manipulations. We implement
state-of-the-art attack algorithms from each perspective to rigorously assess
model resilience. Through extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets from
diverse domains, our findings reveal that GraphLLMs are highly susceptible to
text attacks that merely replace a few semantically similar words in a node's
textual attribute. We also find that standard graph structure attack methods
can significantly degrade model performance, while random shuffling of the
candidate label set in prompt templates leads to substantial performance drops.
Beyond characterizing these vulnerabilities, we investigate defense techniques
tailored to each attack vector through data-augmented training and adversarial
training, which show promising potential to enhance the robustness of
GraphLLMs. We hope that our open-sourced library will facilitate rapid,
equitable evaluation and inspire further innovative research in this field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 概率值（如Shapley值）在可解释AI中至关重要，但精确计算需指数时间，因此需要高效的近似方法。

Method: 结合蒙特卡洛采样和线性回归，允许用任何高效计算概率值的函数族替代线性回归，利用树模型（如XGBoost）提高准确性。

Abstract: With origins in game theory, probabilistic values like Shapley values,
Banzhaf values, and semi-values have emerged as a central tool in explainable
AI. They are used for feature attribution, data attribution, data valuation,
and more. Since all of these values require exponential time to compute
exactly, research has focused on efficient approximation methods using two
techniques: Monte Carlo sampling and linear regression formulations. In this
work, we present a new way of combining both of these techniques. Our approach
is more flexible than prior algorithms, allowing for linear regression to be
replaced with any function family whose probabilistic values can be computed
efficiently. This allows us to harness the accuracy of tree-based models like
XGBoost, while still producing unbiased estimates. From experiments across
eight datasets, we find that our methods give state-of-the-art performance for
estimating probabilistic values. For Shapley values, the error of our methods
can be $6.5\times$ lower than Permutation SHAP (the most popular Monte Carlo
method), $3.8\times$ lower than Kernel SHAP (the most popular linear regression
method), and $2.6\times$ lower than Leverage SHAP (the prior state-of-the-art
Shapley value estimator). For more general probabilistic values, we can obtain
error $215\times$ lower than the best estimator from prior work.

Result: 在存在显著协变量偏移的真实数据集上，性能显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了分子预测模型在分布外数据上的泛化问题，为药物发现提供了更可靠的预测工具。

Abstract: A widely recognized limitation of molecular prediction models is their
reliance on structures observed in the training data, resulting in poor
generalization to out-of-distribution compounds. Yet in drug discovery, the
compounds most critical for advancing research often lie beyond the training
set, making the bias toward the training data particularly problematic. This
mismatch introduces substantial covariate shift, under which standard deep
learning models produce unstable and inaccurate predictions. Furthermore, the
scarcity of labeled data, stemming from the onerous and costly nature of
experimental validation, further exacerbates the difficulty of achieving
reliable generalization. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
meta-learning-based approach that leverages unlabeled data to interpolate
between in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) data, enabling the
model to meta-learn how to generalize beyond the training distribution. We
demonstrate significant performance gains over state-of-the-art methods on
challenging real-world datasets that exhibit substantial covariate shift.

Abstract: Effective resource management and network slicing are essential to meet the
diverse service demands of vehicular networks, including Enhanced Mobile
Broadband (eMBB) and Ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Communications (URLLC).
This paper introduces an Explainable Deep Reinforcement Learning (XRL)
framework for dynamic network slicing and resource allocation in vehicular

Motivation: 研究Mamba中输入选择性的作用及其与其他操作的交互，以提升对其性能的理解。

Method: 分析S6层的功能，证明其能表示Haar小波投影，动态抵消记忆衰减，并提供MQAR任务的解析解。

Result: Mamba在逼近不连续函数、长期记忆和关联召回任务中表现优于S4D。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了Mamba的机制，并指出了改进方向。

Abstract: State-Space Models (SSMs), and particularly Mamba, have recently emerged as a
promising alternative to Transformers. Mamba introduces input selectivity to
its SSM layer (S6) and incorporates convolution and gating into its block
definition. While these modifications do improve Mamba's performance over its
SSM predecessors, it remains largely unclear how Mamba leverages the additional
functionalities provided by input selectivity, and how these interact with the
other operations in the Mamba architecture. In this work, we demystify the role
of input selectivity in Mamba, investigating its impact on function
approximation power, long-term memorization, and associative recall
capabilities. In particular: (i) we prove that the S6 layer of Mamba can
represent projections onto Haar wavelets, providing an edge over its Diagonal
SSM (S4D) predecessor in approximating discontinuous functions commonly arising
in practice; (ii) we show how the S6 layer can dynamically counteract memory
decay; (iii) we provide analytical solutions to the MQAR associative recall
task using the Mamba architecture with different mixers -- Mamba, Mamba-2, and
S4D. We demonstrate the tightness of our theoretical constructions with
empirical results on concrete tasks. Our findings offer a mechanistic
understanding of Mamba and reveal opportunities for improvement.

Result: 新方法在白盒攻击场景下优于现有技术，并研究了对抗性示例在不同架构间的可转移性。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效保护Transformer免受对抗性示例的转移性攻击。

Abstract: Due to great success of transformers in many applications such as natural
language processing and computer vision, transformers have been successfully
applied in automatic modulation classification. We have shown that
transformer-based radio signal classification is vulnerable to imperceptible
and carefully crafted attacks called adversarial examples. Therefore, we
propose a defense system against adversarial examples in transformer-based
modulation classifications. Considering the need for computationally efficient
architecture particularly for Internet of Things (IoT)-based applications or
operation of devices in environment where power supply is limited, we propose a
compact transformer for modulation classification. The advantages of robust
training such as adversarial training in transformers may not be attainable in
compact transformers. By demonstrating this, we propose a novel compact
transformer that can enhance robustness in the presence of adversarial attacks.
The new method is aimed at transferring the adversarial attention map from the
robustly trained large transformer to a compact transformer. The proposed
method outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques for the considered white-box
scenarios including fast gradient method and projected gradient descent
attacks. We have provided reasoning of the underlying working mechanisms and
investigated the transferability of the adversarial examples between different
architectures. The proposed method has the potential to protect the transformer
from the transferability of adversarial examples.

Motivation: 现有方法难以正确处理先验和测量信号之间的冲突，尤其是在非高斯或未知噪声的情况下。

Method: 提出了Measurement-Aligned Sampling (MAS)框架，统一并扩展了现有方法（如DDNM和DAPS），并提供了新的优化视角。

Result: MAS能够处理已知高斯噪声、未知或非高斯噪声类型，并在实验中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MAS为线性逆问题提供了一种更灵活且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models provide a powerful way to incorporate complex prior
information for solving inverse problems. However, existing methods struggle to
correctly incorporate guidance from conflicting signals in the prior and
measurement, especially in the challenging setting of non-Gaussian or unknown
noise. To bridge these gaps, we propose Measurement-Aligned Sampling (MAS), a
novel framework for linear inverse problem solving that can more flexibly
balance prior and measurement information. MAS unifies and extends existing
approaches like DDNM and DAPS, and offers a new optimization perspective. MAS
can generalize to handle known Gaussian noise, unknown or non-Gaussian noise
types. Extensive experiments show that MAS consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods across a range of tasks.

Conclusion: 该方法无需重放缓冲区或离线重新训练，能够在线更新所有网络参数，且后验预测分布定义良好。

Abstract: We introduce scalable algorithms for online learning and generalized Bayesian
inference of neural network parameters, designed for sequential decision making
tasks. Our methods combine the strengths of frequentist and Bayesian filtering,
which include fast low-rank updates via a block-diagonal approximation of the
parameter error covariance, and a well-defined posterior predictive
distribution that we use for decision making. More precisely, our main method
updates a low-rank error covariance for the hidden layers parameters, and a
full-rank error covariance for the final layer parameters. Although this
characterizes an improper posterior, we show that the resulting posterior
predictive distribution is well-defined. Our methods update all network
parameters online, with no need for replay buffers or offline retraining. We
show, empirically, that our methods achieve a competitive tradeoff between
speed and accuracy on (non-stationary) contextual bandit problems and Bayesian
optimization problems.

Abstract: Advantages of deep learning over traditional methods have been demonstrated
for radio signal classification in the recent years. However, various
researchers have discovered that even a small but intentional feature
perturbation known as adversarial examples can significantly deteriorate the
performance of the deep learning based radio signal classification. Among
various kinds of adversarial examples, universal adversarial perturbation has
gained considerable attention due to its feature of being data independent,
hence as a practical strategy to fool the radio signal classification with a
high success rate. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate a defense system
called neural rejection system to propose against universal adversarial
perturbations, and evaluate its performance by generating white-box universal
adversarial perturbations. We show that the proposed neural rejection system is
able to defend universal adversarial perturbations with significantly higher
accuracy than the undefended deep neural network.

Motivation: 传统独立链采样策略在推理任务中存在探索不足和奖励稀疏的问题，而树搜索能提供密集的过程奖励，但尚未在LLM强化学习中充分探索。

Method: 提出TreeRL框架，直接整合树搜索进行强化学习训练，引入中间监督并避免单独奖励模型训练，同时采用高效分支策略提升搜索效率。

Result: 在数学和代码推理基准测试中，TreeRL表现优于传统ChainRL，验证了树搜索在LLM中的潜力。

Conclusion: TreeRL展示了树搜索在LLM强化学习中的有效性，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with tree search has demonstrated superior
performance in traditional reasoning tasks. Compared to conventional
independent chain sampling strategies with outcome supervision, tree search
enables better exploration of the reasoning space and provides dense, on-policy
process rewards during RL training but remains under-explored in On-Policy LLM
RL. We propose TreeRL, a reinforcement learning framework that directly
incorporates on-policy tree search for RL training. Our approach includes
intermediate supervision and eliminates the need for a separate reward model
training. Existing approaches typically train a separate process reward model,
which can suffer from distribution mismatch and reward hacking. We also
introduce a cost-effective tree search approach that achieves higher search
efficiency under the same generation token budget by strategically branching
from high-uncertainty intermediate steps rather than using random branching.
Experiments on challenging math and code reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that
TreeRL achieves superior performance compared to traditional ChainRL,
highlighting the potential of tree search for LLM. TreeRL is open-sourced at

Conclusion: XAStruct为数据驱动的XAS分析和局部结构推断提供了可扩展的解决方案，独立训练任务确保了最佳性能。

Abstract: X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) is a powerful technique for probing local
atomic environments, yet its interpretation remains limited by the need for
expert-driven analysis, computationally expensive simulations, and
element-specific heuristics. Recent advances in machine learning have shown
promise for accelerating XAS interpretation, but many existing models are
narrowly focused on specific elements, edge types, or spectral regimes. In this
work, we present XAStruct, a learning framework capable of both predicting XAS
spectra from crystal structures and inferring local structural descriptors from
XAS input. XAStruct is trained on a large-scale dataset spanning over 70
elements across the periodic table, enabling generalization to a wide variety
of chemistries and bonding environments. The model includes the first machine
learning approach for predicting neighbor atom types directly from XAS spectra,
as well as a unified regression model for mean nearest-neighbor distance that
requires no element-specific tuning. While we explored integrating the two
pipelines into a single end-to-end model, empirical results showed performance
degradation. As a result, the two tasks were trained independently to ensure
optimal accuracy and task-specific performance. By combining deep neural
networks for complex structure-property mappings with efficient baseline models
for simpler tasks, XAStruct offers a scalable and extensible solution for
data-driven XAS analysis and local structure inference. The source code will be
released upon paper acceptance.

Result: 理论和实验证明，使用优势函数训练能提升轨迹外性能。

Conclusion: 优势函数是缓解策略混淆、提升泛化能力的有效工具。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that reinforcement learning agents can develop policies
that exploit spurious correlations between rewards and observations. This
phenomenon, known as policy confounding, arises because the agent's policy
influences both past and future observation variables, creating a feedback loop
that can hinder the agent's ability to generalize beyond its usual
trajectories. In this paper, we show that the advantage function, commonly used
in policy gradient methods, not only reduces the variance of gradient estimates
but also mitigates the effects of policy confounding. By adjusting action
values relative to the state representation, the advantage function downweights
state-action pairs that are more likely under the current policy, breaking
spurious correlations and encouraging the agent to focus on causal factors. We
provide both analytical and empirical evidence demonstrating that training with
the advantage function leads to improved out-of-trajectory performance.

Conclusion: 通过强化学习框架，可以有效地利用无标签图像数据进行预训练，并改进特征学习。

Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL), value-based algorithms learn to associate
each observation with the states and rewards that are likely to be reached from
it. We observe that many self-supervised image pre-training methods bear
similarity to this formulation: learning features that associate crops of
images with those of nearby views, e.g., by taking a different crop or color
augmentation. In this paper, we complete this analogy and explore a method that
directly casts pre-training on unlabeled image data like web crawls and video
frames as an RL problem. We train a general value function in a dynamical
system where an agent transforms an image by changing the view or adding image
augmentations. Learning in this way resembles crop-consistency
self-supervision, but through the reward function, offers a simple lever to
shape feature learning using curated images or weakly labeled captions when
they exist. Our experiments demonstrate improved representations when training
on unlabeled images in the wild, including video data like EpicKitchens, scene
data like COCO, and web-crawl data like CC12M.

Abstract: Free-flow road networks, such as suburban highways, are increasingly
experiencing traffic congestion due to growing commuter inflow and limited
infrastructure. Traditional control mechanisms, such as traffic signals or
local heuristics, are ineffective or infeasible in these high-speed,
signal-free environments. We introduce self-regulating cars, a reinforcement
learning-based traffic control protocol that dynamically modulates vehicle
speeds to optimize throughput and prevent congestion, without requiring new
physical infrastructure. Our approach integrates classical traffic flow theory,
gap acceptance models, and microscopic simulation into a physics-informed RL
framework. By abstracting roads into super-segments, the agent captures
emergent flow dynamics and learns robust speed modulation policies from
instantaneous traffic observations. Evaluated in the high-fidelity PTV Vissim
simulator on a real-world highway network, our method improves total throughput
by 5%, reduces average delay by 13%, and decreases total stops by 3% compared
to the no-control setting. It also achieves smoother, congestion-resistant flow
while generalizing across varied traffic patterns, demonstrating its potential
for scalable, ML-driven traffic management.

Abstract: Deep neural networks deployed in safety-critical, resource-constrained

compression and certified robustness as separate goals, compromising either
efficiency or safety. We propose CACTUS (Compression Aware Certified Training
Using network Sets), a general framework for unifying these objectives during
training. CACTUS models maintain high certified accuracy even when compressed.
We apply CACTUS for both pruning and quantization and show that it effectively
trains models which can be efficiently compressed while maintaining high
accuracy and certifiable robustness. CACTUS achieves state-of-the-art accuracy
and certified performance for both pruning and quantization on a variety of
datasets and input specifications.

Motivation: 现代RNN架构（如xLSTM和Mamba）在语言建模中挑战了Transformer，但其结构限制了其在多维数据（如图像或分子图）上的应用。MDRNNs虽适合多维数据，但缺乏并行化能力。

Method: 引入pLSTMs，通过源、转换和标记门操作DAG的线图，实现并行化。针对DAG中的长距离依赖问题，提出两种模式：定向传播模式（P-mode）和扩散分布模式（D-mode）。

Conclusion: pLSTMs为处理多维数据提供了一种高效且并行化的解决方案，尤其在长距离依赖任务中表现突出。

Abstract: Modern recurrent architectures, such as xLSTM and Mamba, have recently
challenged the Transformer in language modeling. However, their structure
constrains their applicability to sequences only or requires processing
multi-dimensional data structures, such as images or molecular graphs, in a
pre-defined sequential order. In contrast, Multi-Dimensional RNNs (MDRNNs) are
well suited for data with a higher level structure, like 2D grids, trees, and
directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). In this work, we extend the notion of
multi-dimensionality to linear RNNs. We introduce parallelizable Linear Source
Transition Mark networks (pLSTMs) using Source, Transition, and Mark gates that
act on the line graph of a general DAG. This enables parallelization in analogy
to parallel associative scans and the chunkwise-recurrent form of sequential
linear RNNs, but for DAGs. For regular grids (1D and 2D), like images, this
scheme can be efficiently implemented using einsum operations, concatenations,
and padding in logarithmic time. pLSTMs tackle the vanishing/exploding
activation/gradient problem for long distances in DAGs via two distinct modes:
a directed propagation mode (P-mode) and a diffusive distribution mode
(D-mode). To showcase the long-range capabilities of pLSTM, we introduce
arrow-pointing extrapolation as a synthetic computer vision task that contains
long-distance directional information. We demonstrate that pLSTMs generalize
well to larger image sizes, whereas Transformers struggle to extrapolate. On
established molecular graph and computer vision benchmarks, pLSTMs also show
strong performance. Code and Datasets are available at:

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对神经网络训练过程中检查点存储占用大的问题，提出高效的压缩方法以适应存储受限环境。

Method: 1. 使用基于预测的算术编码压缩；2. 结合剪枝和量化进一步优化压缩性能。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著减小比特大小，且恢复的检查点能近乎无损地恢复训练，保持模型性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在存储受限环境下高效且实用，平衡了压缩率和模型性能。

Abstract: This paper is dedicated to an efficient compression of weights and optimizer
states (called checkpoints) obtained at different stages during a neural
network training process. First, we propose a prediction-based compression
approach, where values from the previously saved checkpoint are used for
context modeling in arithmetic coding. Second, in order to enhance the
compression performance, we also propose to apply pruning and quantization of
the checkpoint values. Experimental results show that our approach achieves
substantial bit size reduction, while enabling near-lossless training recovery
from restored checkpoints, preserving the model's performance and making it
suitable for storage-limited environments.

Motivation: 神经代理模型在未见问题配置下性能显著下降，而域适应技术在视觉和语言处理中已广泛应用。

Method: 引入SIMSHIFT数据集，扩展域适应方法至神经代理模型，利用源配置和目标配置的参数描述进行预测。

Result: 实验表明域适应在仿真中有潜力，但分布偏移下实现稳健神经代理仍具挑战。

Conclusion: 域适应可提升神经代理模型性能，但在工业场景中仍需解决分布偏移问题。

Abstract: Neural surrogates for Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) often suffer
significant performance degradation when evaluated on unseen problem
configurations, such as novel material types or structural dimensions.
Meanwhile, Domain Adaptation (DA) techniques have been widely used in vision
and language processing to generalize from limited information about unseen
configurations. In this work, we address this gap through two focused
contributions. First, we introduce SIMSHIFT, a novel benchmark dataset and
evaluation suite composed of four industrial simulation tasks: hot rolling,
sheet metal forming, electric motor design and heatsink design. Second, we
extend established domain adaptation methods to state of the art neural
surrogates and systematically evaluate them. These approaches use parametric
descriptions and ground truth simulations from multiple source configurations,
together with only parametric descriptions from target configurations. The goal
is to accurately predict target simulations without access to ground truth
simulation data. Extensive experiments on SIMSHIFT highlight the challenges of
out of distribution neural surrogate modeling, demonstrate the potential of DA
in simulation, and reveal open problems in achieving robust neural surrogates
under distribution shifts in industrially relevant scenarios. Our codebase is

TL;DR: EMLoC是一种基于模拟器的内存高效微调框架，通过LoRA校正，使模型微调在推理所需的内存预算内完成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源基础模型虽强大，但针对特定领域或个性化任务的微调因内存开销大而成本高昂。

Method: EMLoC利用激活感知SVD构建轻量模拟器，通过LoRA微调，并提出补偿算法校正LoRA模块。

Result: 实验显示EMLoC在多个数据集和模态上优于基线，支持在24GB GPU上微调38B模型。

Conclusion: EMLoC为个体用户提供了高效且实用的模型适配方案。

Abstract: Open-source foundation models have seen rapid adoption and development,
enabling powerful general-purpose capabilities across diverse domains. However,
fine-tuning large foundation models for domain-specific or personalized tasks
remains prohibitively expensive for most users due to the significant memory
overhead beyond that of inference. We introduce EMLoC, an Emulator-based
Memory-efficient fine-tuning framework with LoRA Correction, which enables
model fine-tuning within the same memory budget required for inference. EMLoC
constructs a task-specific light-weight emulator using activation-aware
singular value decomposition (SVD) on a small downstream calibration set.
Fine-tuning then is performed on this lightweight emulator via LoRA. To tackle
the misalignment between the original model and the compressed emulator, we
propose a novel compensation algorithm to correct the fine-tuned LoRA module,
which thus can be merged into the original model for inference. EMLoC supports
flexible compression ratios and standard training pipelines, making it
adaptable to a wide range of applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that EMLoC outperforms other baselines across multiple datasets and modalities.
Moreover, without quantization, EMLoC enables fine-tuning of a 38B model on a
single 24GB consumer GPU-bringing efficient and practical model adaptation to
individual users.

TL;DR: 论文研究了开放多智能体系统中的n智能体临时团队（NAHT）问题，提出基于合作博弈论的方法，通过扩展游戏空间和状态空间，利用Shapley值分配贡献，并提出了Shapley Machine算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏理论严谨性和明确的信用分配，因此需要一种更系统的方法来解决NAHT问题。

Method: 通过合作博弈论建模NAHT，扩展游戏和状态空间，利用Shapley值分配贡献，并开发了Shapley Machine算法。

Result: 实验验证了Shapley Machine的有效性和理论的合理性。

Conclusion: 论文首次将合作博弈论与强化学习概念直接关联，为解决NAHT问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Open multi-agent systems are increasingly important in modeling real-world
applications, such as smart grids, swarm robotics, etc. In this paper, we aim
to investigate a recently proposed problem for open multi-agent systems,
referred to as n-agent ad hoc teamwork (NAHT), where only a number of agents
are controlled. Existing methods tend to be based on heuristic design and
consequently lack theoretical rigor and ambiguous credit assignment among
agents. To address these limitations, we model and solve NAHT through the lens
of cooperative game theory. More specifically, we first model an open
multi-agent system, characterized by its value, as an instance situated in a
space of cooperative games, generated by a set of basis games. We then extend
this space, along with the state space, to accommodate dynamic scenarios,
thereby characterizing NAHT. Exploiting the justifiable assumption that basis
game values correspond to a sequence of n-step returns with different horizons,
we represent the state values for NAHT in a form similar to $\lambda$-returns.
Furthermore, we derive Shapley values to allocate state values to the
controlled agents, as credits for their contributions to the ad hoc team.
Different from the conventional approach to shaping Shapley values in an
explicit form, we shape Shapley values by fulfilling the three axioms uniquely
describing them, well defined on the extended game space describing NAHT. To
estimate Shapley values in dynamic scenarios, we propose a TD($\lambda$)-like
algorithm. The resulting reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is referred to
as Shapley Machine. To our best knowledge, this is the first time that the
concepts from cooperative game theory are directly related to RL concepts. In
experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Shapley Machine and verify
reasonableness of our theory.

incorporated to evaluate agent's performance, providing visual plots to track
learning progress. This work demonstrates the potential of AutoGen-style agents
for autonomous, scalable, and iterative analysis in social science domains

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems have recently emerged as a promising paradigm for
collaborative reasoning and solving complex tasks. However, the design of
collaborative learning algorithms in multi-agent systems faces several
challenges, including high communication overhead and insufficient agent-level
personalization. In this paper, we propose PE-MA (Parameter-Efficient
Multi-Agent Co-Evolution), a novel collaboration framework that supports
efficient, scalable, and personalized co-evolution in multi-agent systems. In
PE-MA, each agent maintains a lightweight personalized adapter to support
agent-specific behavior, while a shared adapter is collaboratively optimized
across neighboring agents. This design balances global coordination with local
adaptation under heterogeneous environments. We achieve an asymptotically
optimal convergence rate of O( 1/(NK)^(1/2) ), where N is the number of agents
and K the local update steps.

Result: Poutine-Base验证集RFS为8.12，接近专家水平；最终模型在Waymo测试集RFS为7.99，排名第一。

Conclusion: VLT预训练和轻量级RL微调是实现鲁棒自动驾驶的有效方法。

Abstract: We present Poutine, a 3B-parameter vision-language model (VLM) tailored for
end-to-end autonomous driving in long-tail driving scenarios. Poutine is
trained in two stages. To obtain strong base driving capabilities, we train
Poutine-Base in a self-supervised vision-language-trajectory (VLT) next-token
prediction fashion on 83 hours of CoVLA nominal driving and 11 hours of Waymo
long-tail driving. Accompanying language annotations are auto-generated with a
72B-parameter VLM. Poutine is obtained by fine-tuning Poutine-Base with Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using less than 500 preference-labeled
frames from the Waymo validation set. We show that both VLT pretraining and RL
fine-tuning are critical to attain strong driving performance in the long-tail.
Poutine-Base achieves a rater-feedback score (RFS) of 8.12 on the validation
set, nearly matching Waymo's expert ground-truth RFS. The final Poutine model
achieves an RFS of 7.99 on the official Waymo test set, placing 1st in the 2025

Motivation: 机器人操作在泛化到未见过的对象、环境和多样化语言指令任务时面临挑战，现有方法在视觉环境中生成接地计划的能力不足。

Method: Gondola结合多视角图像和历史计划，生成包含目标对象和位置分割掩码的动作计划，并利用RLBench模拟器构建三类数据集进行训练。

Result: Gondola在GemBench数据集的四个泛化级别上均优于现有LLM方法。

Conclusion: Gondola通过多视角输入和视觉接地显著提升了机器人操作的泛化能力。

Abstract: Robotic manipulation faces a significant challenge in generalizing across
unseen objects, environments and tasks specified by diverse language
instructions. To improve generalization capabilities, recent research has
incorporated large language models (LLMs) for planning and action execution.
While promising, these methods often fall short in generating grounded plans in
visual environments. Although efforts have been made to perform visual
instructional tuning on LLMs for robotic manipulation, existing methods are
typically constrained by single-view image input and struggle with precise
object grounding. In this work, we introduce Gondola, a novel grounded
vision-language planning model based on LLMs for generalizable robotic
manipulation. Gondola takes multi-view images and history plans to produce the
next action plan with interleaved texts and segmentation masks of target
objects and locations. To support the training of Gondola, we construct three
types of datasets using the RLBench simulator, namely robot grounded planning,
multi-view referring expression and pseudo long-horizon task datasets. Gondola
outperforms the state-of-the-art LLM-based method across all four
generalization levels of the GemBench dataset, including novel placements,
rigid objects, articulated objects and long-horizon tasks.

Conclusion: 需改进对次优演示的建模，以提升LfD算法，缩小实验室训练与实际部署的差距。

Abstract: Learning from Demonstration (LfD) is a popular approach for robots to acquire
new skills, but most LfD methods suffer from imperfections in human
demonstrations. Prior work typically treats these suboptimalities as random
noise. In this paper we study non-optimal behaviors in non-expert
demonstrations and show that they are systematic, forming what we call
demonstration sidetracks. Using a public space study with 40 participants
performing a long-horizon robot task, we recreated the setup in simulation and
annotated all demonstrations. We identify four types of sidetracks
(Exploration, Mistake, Alignment, Pause) and one control pattern (one-dimension
control). Sidetracks appear frequently across participants, and their temporal
and spatial distribution is tied to task context. We also find that users'
control patterns depend on the control interface. These insights point to the
need for better models of suboptimal demonstrations to improve LfD algorithms
and bridge the gap between lab training and real-world deployment. All
demonstrations, infrastructure, and annotations are available at

Abstract: We present a method for the unattended gray-box identification of sensor
models commonly used by localization algorithms in the field of robotics. The
objective is to determine the most likely sensor model for a time series of
unknown measurement data, given an extendable catalog of predefined sensor
models. Sensor model definitions may require states for rigid-body calibrations
and dedicated reference frames to replicate a measurement based on the robot's
localization state. A health metric is introduced, which verifies the outcome
of the selection process in order to detect false positives and facilitate
reliable decision-making. In a second stage, an initial guess for identified
calibration states is generated, and the necessity of sensor world reference
frames is evaluated. The identified sensor model with its parameter information
is then used to parameterize and initialize a state estimation application,
thus ensuring a more accurate and robust integration of new sensor elements.
This method is helpful for inexperienced users who want to identify the source
and type of a measurement, sensor calibrations, or sensor reference frames. It
will also be important in the field of modular multi-agent scenarios and
modularized robotic platforms that are augmented by sensor modalities during
runtime. Overall, this work aims to provide a simplified integration of sensor
modalities to downstream applications and circumvent common pitfalls in the
usage and development of localization approaches.

Abstract: While robotic automation has demonstrated remarkable performance, such as
executing hundreds of experiments continuously over several days, it is
challenging to design a program that synchronizes the robot's movements with
the experimental jigs to conduct an experiment. We propose a concept that
enables the automation of experiments by utilizing dual demonstrations of robot
motions and jig operations by chemists in an experimental environment
constructed to be controlled by a robot. To verify this concept, we developed a
chemical-experiment-automation system consisting of jigs to assist the robot in
experiments, a motion-demonstration interface, a jig-control interface, and a
mobile manipulator. We validate the concept through polymer-synthesis
experiments, focusing on critical liquid-handling tasks such as pipetting and
dilution. The experimental results indicate high reproducibility of the
demonstrated motions and robust task-success rates. This comprehensive concept
not only simplifies the robot programming process for chemists but also
provides a flexible and efficient solution to accommodate a wide range of
experimental conditions, contributing significantly to the field of chemical
experiment automation.

Abstract: The use of robotic technology has drastically increased in manufacturing in
the 21st century. But by utilizing their sensory cues, humans still outperform
machines, especially in micro scale manufacturing, which requires
high-precision robot manipulators. These sensory cues naturally compensate for
high levels of uncertainties that exist in the manufacturing environment.
Uncertainties in performing manufacturing tasks may come from measurement
noise, model inaccuracy, joint compliance (e.g., elasticity), etc. Although
advanced metrology sensors and high precision microprocessors, which are
utilized in modern robots, have compensated for many structural and dynamic
errors in robot positioning, a well-designed control algorithm still works as a
comparable and cheaper alternative to reduce uncertainties in automated
manufacturing. Our work illustrates that a multi-robot control system that
simulates the positioning process for fastening and unfastening applications
can reduce various uncertainties, which may occur in this process, to a great
extent. In addition, most research papers in visual servoing mainly focus on
developing control and observation architectures in various scenarios, but few
have discussed the importance of the camera's location in the configuration. In
a manufacturing environment, the quality of camera estimations may vary
significantly from one observation location to another, as the combined effects
of environmental conditions result in different noise levels of a single image
shot at different locations. Therefore, in this paper, we also propose a novel
algorithm for the camera's moving policy so that it explores the camera
workspace and searches for the optimal location where the image noise level is
minimized.

Conclusion: 跨形态数据和复合生成架构有助于学习鲁棒、泛化的运动技能。

Abstract: Generalizing locomotion policies across diverse legged robots with varying
morphologies is a key challenge due to differences in observation/action
dimensions and system dynamics. In this work, we propose Multi-Loco, a novel
unified framework combining a morphology-agnostic generative diffusion model
with a lightweight residual policy optimized via reinforcement learning (RL).
The diffusion model captures morphology-invariant locomotion patterns from
diverse cross-embodiment datasets, improving generalization and robustness. The
residual policy is shared across all embodiments and refines the actions
generated by the diffusion model, enhancing task-aware performance and
robustness for real-world deployment. We evaluated our method with a rich
library of four legged robots in both simulation and real-world experiments.
Compared to a standard RL framework with PPO, our approach -- replacing the
Gaussian policy with a diffusion model and residual term -- achieves a 10.35%
average return improvement, with gains up to 13.57% in wheeled-biped locomotion
tasks. These results highlight the benefits of cross-embodiment data and
composite generative architectures in learning robust, generalized locomotion
skills.

Abstract: For autonomous vehicles, safe navigation in complex environments depends on
handling a broad range of diverse and rare driving scenarios. Simulation- and
scenario-based testing have emerged as key approaches to development and
validation of autonomous driving systems. Traditional scenario generation
relies on rule-based systems, knowledge-driven models, and data-driven
synthesis, often producing limited diversity and unrealistic safety-critical
cases. With the emergence of foundation models, which represent a new
generation of pre-trained, general-purpose AI models, developers can process
heterogeneous inputs (e.g., natural language, sensor data, HD maps, and control
actions), enabling the synthesis and interpretation of complex driving
scenarios. In this paper, we conduct a survey about the application of
foundation models for scenario generation and scenario analysis in autonomous
driving (as of May 2025). Our survey presents a unified taxonomy that includes
large language models, vision-language models, multimodal large language
models, diffusion models, and world models for the generation and analysis of
autonomous driving scenarios. In addition, we review the methodologies,
open-source datasets, simulation platforms, and benchmark challenges, and we
examine the evaluation metrics tailored explicitly to scenario generation and
analysis. Finally, the survey concludes by highlighting the open challenges and
research questions, and outlining promising future research directions. All

### [319] [Construction of a Multiple-DOF Under-actuated Gripper with Force-Sensing via Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11570)

Motivation: 设计一种低成本、高通用性的欠驱动夹持器，实现无传感器力反馈控制，解决传统夹持器在力控制和适应性上的不足。

Method: 1. 设计五连杆机构实现平行和包络抓取模式转换；2. 建立运动学和动力传输理论模型；3. 使用LSTM模型实现力反馈控制。

Result: 实验验证了夹持器在负载、抓取力、力传感、稳定性和适应性方面的优异性能。

Conclusion: 该夹持器具有低成本、高通用性和鲁棒性，适用于多种抓取任务。

Abstract: We present a novel under-actuated gripper with two 3-joint fingers, which
realizes force feedback control by the deep learning technique- Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) model, without any force sensor. First, a five-linkage mechanism
stacked by double four-linkages is designed as a finger to automatically
achieve the transformation between parallel and enveloping grasping modes. This
enables the creation of a low-cost under-actuated gripper comprising a single
actuator and two 3-phalange fingers. Second, we devise theoretical models of
kinematics and power transmission based on the proposed gripper, accurately
obtaining fingertip positions and contact forces. Through coupling and
decoupling of five-linkage mechanisms, the proposed gripper offers the expected
capabilities of grasping payload/force/stability and objects with large
dimension ranges. Third, to realize the force control, an LSTM model is
proposed to determine the grasping mode for synthesizing force-feedback control
policies that exploit contact sensing after outlining the uncertainty of
currents using a statistical method. Finally, a series of experiments are
implemented to measure quantitative indicators, such as the payload, grasping
force, force sensing, grasping stability and the dimension ranges of objects to
be grasped. Additionally, the grasping performance of the proposed gripper is
verified experimentally to guarantee the high versatility and robustness of the
proposed gripper.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种轻量级深度强化学习（DRL）方法，用于解决智能制造中多机器人实时动态导航问题，显著提高了计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在解决动态多源单目标（DMS-SD）导航问题时，未能充分利用历史经验或仅使用有限信息，导致计算时间长，难以实现实时操作。

Method: 采用轻量级DRL方法，设计了目标导向的奖励函数，快速收敛到最优解。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了实时性和计算效率，适用于智能制造的轻量级设备。

Abstract: The collaboration and interaction of multiple robots have become integral
aspects of smart manufacturing. Effective planning and management play a
crucial role in achieving energy savings and minimising overall costs. This
paper addresses the real-time Dynamic Multiple Sources to Single Destination
(DMS-SD) navigation problem, particularly with a material distribution case for
multiple intelligent robots in smart manufacturing. Enumerated solutions, such
as in \cite{xiao2022efficient}, tackle the problem by generating as many
optimal or near-optimal solutions as possible but do not learn patterns from
the previous experience, whereas the method in \cite{xiao2023collaborative}
only uses limited information from the earlier trajectories. Consequently,
these methods may take a considerable amount of time to compute results on
large maps, rendering real-time operations impractical. To overcome this
challenge, we propose a lightweight Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) method to
address the DMS-SD problem. The proposed DRL method can be efficiently trained
and rapidly converges to the optimal solution using the designed target-guided
reward function. A well-trained DRL model significantly reduces the computation
time for the next movement to a millisecond level, which improves the time up
to 100 times in our experiments compared to the enumerated solutions. Moreover,
the trained DRL model can be easily deployed on lightweight devices in smart
manufacturing, such as Internet of Things devices and mobile phones, which only
require limited computational resources.

Conclusion: 研究为循环智能与机器人（CIRO）领域奠定基础，公开了源代码。

Abstract: The competition over natural reserves of minerals is expected to increase in
part because of the linear-economy paradigm based on take-make-dispose.
Simultaneously, the linear economy considers end-of-use products as waste
rather than as a resource, which results in large volumes of waste whose
management remains an unsolved problem. Since a transition to a circular
economy can mitigate these open issues, in this paper we begin by enhancing the
notion of circularity based on compartmental dynamical thermodynamics, namely,
$\lambda$, and then, we model a thermodynamical material network processing a
batch of 2 solid materials of criticality coefficients of 0.1 and 0.95, with a
robotic disassembler compartment controlled via reinforcement learning (RL),
and processing 2-7 kg of materials. Subsequently, we focused on the design of
the robotic disassembler compartment using state-of-the-art RL algorithms and
assessing the algorithm performance with respect to $\lambda$ (Fig. 1). The
highest circularity is -2.1 achieved in the case of disassembling 2 parts of 1
kg each, whereas it reduces to -7.2 in the case of disassembling 4 parts of 1
kg each contained inside a chassis of 3 kg. Finally, a sensitivity analysis
highlighted that the impact on $\lambda$ of the performance of an RL controller
has a positive correlation with the quantity and the criticality of the
materials to be disassembled. This work also gives the principles of the
emerging research fields indicated as circular intelligence and robotics
(CIRO). Source code is publicly available.

Abstract: Recent advancements in teleoperation systems have enabled high-quality data
collection for robotic manipulators, showing impressive results in learning
manipulation at scale. This progress suggests that extending these capabilities
to robotic hands could unlock an even broader range of manipulation skills,
especially if we could achieve the same level of dexterity that human hands
exhibit. However, teleoperating robotic hands is far from a solved problem, as
it presents a significant challenge due to the high degrees of freedom of
robotic hands and the complex dynamics occurring during contact-rich settings.
In this work, we present ExoStart, a general and scalable learning framework
that leverages human dexterity to improve robotic hand control. In particular,
we obtain high-quality data by collecting direct demonstrations without a robot
in the loop using a sensorized low-cost wearable exoskeleton, capturing the
rich behaviors that humans can demonstrate with their own hands. We also
propose a simulation-based dynamics filter that generates dynamically feasible
trajectories from the collected demonstrations and use the generated
trajectories to bootstrap an auto-curriculum reinforcement learning method that
relies only on simple sparse rewards. The ExoStart pipeline is generalizable
and yields robust policies that transfer zero-shot to the real robot. Our
results demonstrate that ExoStart can generate dexterous real-world hand
skills, achieving a success rate above 50% on a wide range of complex tasks
such as opening an AirPods case or inserting and turning a key in a lock. More

Conclusion: 该方法为临床教育和诊断模拟中高保真机器人患者奠定了基础。

Abstract: Misdiagnosis can lead to delayed treatments and harm. Robotic patients offer
a controlled way to train and evaluate clinicians in rare, subtle, or complex
cases, reducing diagnostic errors. We present RoboPatient, a medical robotic
simulator aimed at multimodal pain synthesis based on haptic and auditory
feedback during palpation-based training scenarios. The robopatient functions
as an adaptive intermediary, capable of synthesizing plausible pain expressions
vocal and facial in response to tactile stimuli generated during palpation.
Using an abdominal phantom, robopatient captures and processes haptic input via
an internal palpation-to-pain mapping model. To evaluate perceptual congruence
between palpation and the corresponding auditory output, we conducted a study
involving 7680 trials across 20 participants, where they evaluated pain
intensity through sound. Results show that amplitude and pitch significantly
influence agreement with the robot's pain expressions, irrespective of pain
sounds. Stronger palpation forces elicited stronger agreement, aligning with
psychophysical patterns. The study revealed two key dimensions: pitch and
amplitude are central to how people perceive pain sounds, with pitch being the
most influential cue. These acoustic features shape how well the sound matches
the applied force during palpation, impacting perceived realism. This approach
lays the groundwork for high-fidelity robotic patients in clinical education
and diagnostic simulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动驾驶车辆缺乏与乘员的有效双向沟通，限制了个人化和故障恢复能力，影响舒适度和信任感，阻碍广泛采用。

Method: PACE-ADS包含三个基于基础模型的代理：驾驶员代理分析驾驶环境，心理学家代理解析乘员心理信号和认知指令，协调者代理整合输入生成行为决策。

Result: 模拟测试显示PACE-ADS能根据乘员状态调整驾驶风格，提升舒适度，并通过自主推理或人工指导实现安全恢复。

Conclusion: PACE-ADS展示了基于LLM的框架在弥合机器自主性与以人为本驾驶之间差距的潜力。

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in autonomous driving, current autonomous vehicles
(AVs) lack effective bidirectional communication with occupants, limiting
personalization and recovery from immobilization. This reduces comfort and
trust, potentially slowing broader AV adoption. We propose PACE-ADS (Psychology
and Cognition Enabled Automated Driving Systems), a human-centered autonomy
framework that enables AVs to sense, interpret, and respond to both external
traffic and internal occupant states. PACE-ADS comprises three foundation
model-based agents: a Driver Agent that analyzes the driving context, a
Psychologist Agent that interprets occupant psychological signals (e.g., EEG,
heart rate, facial expressions) and cognitive commands (e.g., speech), and a
Coordinator Agent that integrates these inputs to produce high-level behavior
decisions and operational parameters. Rather than replacing existing AV
modules, PACE-ADS complements them by operating at the behavioral level,
delegating low-level control to native AV systems. This separation enables
closed-loop adaptation and supports integration across diverse platforms. We
evaluate PACE-ADS in simulation across varied scenarios involving traffic
lights, pedestrians, work zones, and car following. Results show that PACE-ADS
adapts driving styles to occupant states, improves ride comfort, and enables
safe recovery from immobilization via autonomous reasoning or human guidance.
Our findings highlight the promise of LLM-based frameworks for bridging the gap
between machine autonomy and human-centered driving.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 诊断错误是可预防死亡的主要原因，尤其在资源有限地区。医疗模拟器（如机器人患者）通过模拟真实患者进行触诊训练，但多模态反馈（尤其是疼痛声音）的生成仍具挑战性。

Method: 研究采用近端策略优化（PPO）强化学习技术，机器人根据触诊力动态生成疼痛声音，并通过人类反馈迭代优化。

Conclusion: 该系统为腹部触诊训练提供了可控且沉浸的模拟平台，具有显著应用潜力。

Abstract: Diagnostic errors remain a major cause of preventable deaths, particularly in
resource-limited regions. Medical training simulators, including robopatients,
play a vital role in reducing these errors by mimicking real patients for
procedural training such as palpation. However, generating multimodal feedback,
especially auditory pain expressions, remains challenging due to the complex
relationship between palpation behavior and sound. The high-dimensional nature
of pain sounds makes exploration challenging with conventional methods. This
study introduces a novel experimental paradigm for pain expressivity in
robopatients where they dynamically generate auditory pain expressions in
response to palpation force, by co-optimizing human feedback using machine
learning. Using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), a reinforcement learning
(RL) technique optimized for continuous adaptation, our robot iteratively
refines pain sounds based on real-time human feedback. This robot initializes
randomized pain responses to palpation forces, and the RL agent learns to
adjust these sounds to align with human preferences. The results demonstrated
that the system adapts to an individual's palpation forces and sound
preferences and captures a broad spectrum of pain intensity, from mild
discomfort to acute distress, through RL-guided exploration of the auditory
pain space. The study further showed that pain sound perception exhibits
saturation at lower forces with gender specific thresholds. These findings
highlight the system's potential to enhance abdominal palpation training by
offering a controllable and immersive simulation platform.

high-quality data collection across diverse tasks such as pick and place, item
sorting and assembly insertion. Leveraging high-frequency generative control,
we train end-to-end policies from raw sensory inputs, enabling smooth,

evaluations demonstrate up to 93.3% out of distribution success rates, with up

Result: SAIL在仿真中实现最高4倍加速，现实世界中最高3.2倍加速。

Conclusion: SAIL为模仿学习策略的加速执行提供了有效解决方案，适用于需要高效任务执行的场景。

Abstract: Offline Imitation Learning (IL) methods such as Behavior Cloning are
effective at acquiring complex robotic manipulation skills. However, existing
IL-trained policies are confined to executing the task at the same speed as
shown in demonstration data. This limits the task throughput of a robotic
system, a critical requirement for applications such as industrial automation.
In this paper, we introduce and formalize the novel problem of enabling
faster-than-demonstration execution of visuomotor policies and identify
fundamental challenges in robot dynamics and state-action distribution shifts.
We instantiate the key insights as SAIL (Speed Adaptation for Imitation
Learning), a full-stack system integrating four tightly-connected components:
(1) a consistency-preserving action inference algorithm for smooth motion at
high speed, (2) high-fidelity tracking of controller-invariant motion targets,
(3) adaptive speed modulation that dynamically adjusts execution speed based on
motion complexity, and (4) action scheduling to handle real-world system
latencies. Experiments on 12 tasks across simulation and two real, distinct
robot platforms show that SAIL achieves up to a 4x speedup over demonstration
speed in simulation and up to 3.2x speedup in the real world. Additional detail

Conclusion: 提出的框架通过结构化表示和高效建模，显著提升了说话人日志的性能。

Abstract: Speaker diarization remains challenging due to the need for structured
speaker representations, efficient modeling, and robustness to varying
conditions. We propose a performant, compact diarization framework that
integrates conformer decoders, transformer-updated attractors, and a deep
clustering style angle loss. Our approach refines speaker representations with
an enhanced conformer structure, incorporating cross-attention to attractors
and an additional convolution module. To enforce structured embeddings, we
extend deep clustering by constructing label-attractor vectors, aligning their
directional structure with audio embeddings. We also impose orthogonality
constraints on active attractors for better speaker separation while
suppressing non-active attractors to prevent false activations. Finally, a
permutation invariant training binary cross-entropy loss refines speaker
detection. Experiments show that our method achieves low diarization error
while maintaining parameter count.

wav2vec2 similarity measures effectively identify words without transcription.
Our results highlight the robustness of these representations, which capture
phonetic structures and generalize across speakers. Our results underscore the
importance of pretraining in learning rich and invariant speech

Abstract: Contrastive Language Audio Pretraining (CLAP) is a widely-used method to
bridge the gap between audio and text domains. Current CLAP methods enable
sound and music retrieval in English, ignoring multilingual spoken content. To
address this, we introduce general language audio pretraining (GLAP), which
expands CLAP with multilingual and multi-domain abilities. GLAP demonstrates
its versatility by achieving competitive performance on standard audio-text
retrieval benchmarks like Clotho and AudioCaps, while significantly surpassing
existing methods in speech retrieval and classification tasks. Additionally,
GLAP achieves strong results on widely used sound-event zero-shot benchmarks,

*Fabian Ritter-Gutierrez,Yi-Cheng Lin,Jeremy H. M Wong,Hung-yi Lee,Eng Siong Chng,Nancy F. Chen*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于相关置换的方法，用于合并语音和音乐编码器，显著提升音乐性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 统一语音和音乐模型需要昂贵的预训练，而直接合并未对齐的模型具有挑战性。

Method: 采用相关置换方法，逐层计算最大化特征交叉相关的置换矩阵，合并Transformer层。

Result: 合并后的模型在音乐性能上提升了14.83分，同时保留了语音能力。

Conclusion: 该方法可从独立训练的编码器中创建统一的音频模型。

Abstract: Creating a unified speech and music model requires expensive pre-training.
Model merging can instead create an unified audio model with minimal
computational expense. However, direct merging is challenging when the models
are not aligned in the weight space. Motivated by Git Re-Basin, we introduce a
correlation-permutation approach that aligns a music encoder's internal layers
with a speech encoder. We extend previous work to the case of merging
transformer layers. The method computes a permutation matrix that maximizes the
model's features-wise cross-correlations layer by layer, enabling effective
fusion of these otherwise disjoint models. The merged model retains speech
capabilities through this method while significantly enhancing music
performance, achieving an improvement of 14.83 points in average score compared
to linear interpolation model merging. This work allows the creation of unified
audio models from independently trained encoders.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种轻量级模块化架构，显著减少参数数量，同时保持音频质量和条件一致性，优于ControlNet。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到音频扩散模型缺乏精细的时间控制功能，且ControlNet方法内存占用大、灵活性低。

Method: 采用轻量级模块化架构，减少参数数量，支持独立控制的高效训练和部署。

Result: 在音频质量和条件一致性上与ControlNet相当，但内存占用更低，灵活性更高。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了更高效、灵活的控制方案，适用于音乐制作。

Abstract: Text-to-audio diffusion models produce high-quality and diverse music but
many, if not most, of the SOTA models lack the fine-grained, time-varying
controls essential for music production. ControlNet enables attaching external
controls to a pre-trained generative model by cloning and fine-tuning its
encoder on new conditionings. However, this approach incurs a large memory
footprint and restricts users to a fixed set of controls. We propose a
lightweight, modular architecture that considerably reduces parameter count
while matching ControlNet in audio quality and condition adherence. Our method
offers greater flexibility and significantly lower memory usage, enabling more
efficient training and deployment of independent controls. We conduct extensive
objective and subjective evaluations and provide numerous audio examples on the
accompanying website at https://lightlatentcontrol.github.io

Conclusion: 通过噪声增强隐藏特征的方法有效提升了伪造语音检测性能，且兼容多种模型。

Abstract: Spoofed utterances always contain artifacts introduced by generative models.
While several countermeasures have been proposed to detect spoofed utterances,
most primarily focus on architectural improvements. In this work, we
investigate how artifacts remain hidden in spoofed speech and how to enhance
their presence. We propose a model-agnostic pipeline that amplifies artifacts
using speech enhancement and various types of noise. Our approach consists of
three key steps: noise addition, noise extraction, and noise amplification.
First, we introduce noise into the raw speech. Then, we apply speech
enhancement to extract the entangled noise and artifacts. Finally, we amplify
these extracted features. Moreover, our pipeline is compatible with different
speech enhancement models and countermeasure architectures. Our method improves
spoof detection performance by up to 44.44\% on ASVspoof2019 and 26.34\% on
ASVspoof2021.

Motivation: 评估说话人日志系统中不同架构选择的协同效应，以优化性能。

Method: 研究了不同编码器（SincNet、WavLM）、解码器（LSTM、Mamba、Conformer）、损失函数（多标签和多类别幂集）及分块大小的影响。

Result: 微调WavLM编码器和Conformer解码器表现最佳，多类别损失函数在多数情况下优于多标签，长分块大小对新型架构更有利。

Conclusion: 最佳系统在多个数据集上达到SOTA性能，验证了架构选择的重要性。

Abstract: End-to-End Neural Diarization with Vector Clustering is a powerful and
practical approach to perform Speaker Diarization. Multiple enhancements have
been proposed for the segmentation model of these pipelines, but their synergy
had not been thoroughly evaluated. In this work, we provide an in-depth
analysis on the impact of major architecture choices on the performance of the
pipeline. We investigate different encoders (SincNet, pretrained and finetuned
WavLM), different decoders (LSTM, Mamba, and Conformer), different losses
(multilabel and multiclass powerset), and different chunk sizes. Through
in-depth experiments covering nine datasets, we found that the finetuned
WavLM-based encoder always results in the best systems by a wide margin. The
LSTM decoder is outclassed by Mamba- and Conformer-based decoders, and while we
found Mamba more robust to other architecture choices, it is slightly inferior
to our best architecture, which uses a Conformer encoder. We found that
multilabel and multiclass powerset losses do not have the same distribution of
errors. We confirmed that the multiclass loss helps almost all models attain
superior performance, except when finetuning WavLM, in which case, multilabel
is the superior choice. We also evaluated the impact of the chunk size on all
aforementioned architecture choices and found that newer architectures tend to
better handle long chunk sizes, which can greatly improve pipeline performance.
Our best system achieved state-of-the-art results on five widely used speaker
diarization datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统听力测试对老年性耳聋患者的超阈值听力缺陷评估不足，需要更具体的诊断性语音感知测试。

Method: 利用自动语音识别系统模拟听力损失，通过多阶段计算流程设计和验证语音测试，最终优化出25对单词对。

Result: SimPhon Speech Test-25的诊断性能与标准语音可懂度指数无显著相关性，表明其能捕捉超出简单可听性的感知缺陷。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提高了听力测试开发的效率，并准备进行初步人体试验。

Abstract: Traditional audiometry often provides an incomplete characterization of the
functional impact of hearing loss on speech understanding, particularly for
supra-threshold deficits common in presbycusis. This motivates the development
of more diagnostically specific speech perception tests. We introduce the
Simulated Phoneme Speech Test (SimPhon Speech Test) methodology, a novel,
multi-stage computational pipeline for the in silico design and validation of a
phonetically balanced minimal-pair speech test. This methodology leverages a
modern Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system as a proxy for a human
listener to simulate the perceptual effects of sensorineural hearing loss. By
processing speech stimuli under controlled acoustic degradation, we first
identify the most common phoneme confusion patterns. These patterns then guide
the data-driven curation of a large set of candidate word pairs derived from a
comprehensive linguistic corpus. Subsequent phases involving simulated
diagnostic testing, expert human curation, and a final, targeted sensitivity
analysis systematically reduce the candidates to a final, optimized set of 25
pairs (the SimPhon Speech Test-25). A key finding is that the diagnostic
performance of the SimPhon Speech Test-25 test items shows no significant
correlation with predictions from the standard Speech Intelligibility Index
(SII), suggesting the SimPhon Speech Test captures perceptual deficits beyond
simple audibility. This computationally optimized test set offers a significant
increase in efficiency for audiological test development, ready for initial
human trials.

TL;DR: 提出一种方法，通过自动检测可被现代ASR系统可靠转录的片段，实现对儿童长时音频的部分准确转录。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长时音频转录对研究儿童语言发展至关重要，但传统ASR在噪声环境下效果不佳，且全面手动标注不可行。

Method: 自动检测可被ASR准确转录的片段，仅转录这些部分，而非全部音频。

Result: 在四个英语长时音频语料库中，该方法转录13%的语音，中位WER为0%，平均WER为18%，显著优于全量转录。

Conclusion: 该方法为儿童长时音频的自动化语言分析提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Longform audio recordings obtained with microphones worn by children-also
known as child-centered daylong recordings-have become a standard method for
studying children's language experiences and their impact on subsequent
language development. Transcripts of longform speech audio would enable rich
analyses at various linguistic levels, yet the massive scale of typical
longform corpora prohibits comprehensive manual annotation. At the same time,
automatic speech recognition (ASR)-based transcription faces significant
challenges due to the noisy, unconstrained nature of real-world audio, and no
existing study has successfully applied ASR to transcribe such data. However,
previous attempts have assumed that ASR must process each longform recording in
its entirety. In this work, we present an approach to automatically detect
those utterances in longform audio that can be reliably transcribed with modern
ASR systems, allowing automatic and relatively accurate transcription of a
notable proportion of all speech in typical longform data. We validate the
approach on four English longform audio corpora, showing that it achieves a
median word error rate (WER) of 0% and a mean WER of 18% when transcribing 13%
of the total speech in the dataset. In contrast, transcribing all speech
without any filtering yields a median WER of 52% and a mean WER of 51%. We also
compare word log-frequencies derived from the automatic transcripts with those
from manual annotations and show that the frequencies correlate at r = 0.92
(Pearson) for all transcribed words and r = 0.98 for words that appear at least
five times in the automatic transcripts. Overall, the work provides a concrete
step toward increasingly detailed automated linguistic analyses of
child-centered longform audio.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究抽象声音的合成方法，旨在通过声音融合生成具有新听觉特征的声音，而不仅仅是原始声音的简单叠加。

Method: 采用反演技术，基于DPMSolver++采样器设计SDE和ODE反演模型，消除噪声预测项的循环依赖，无需提示条件即可灵活控制合成过程。

Result: 提出的反演方法能够在不依赖提示条件的情况下，灵活地合成具有新特征的声音。

Conclusion: 该方法为声音融合提供了一种高效且可控的解决方案，能够生成超越简单叠加的新声音。

Abstract: An abstract sound is defined as a sound that does not disclose identifiable
real-world sound events to a listener. Sound fusion aims to synthesize an
original sound and a reference sound to generate a novel sound that exhibits
auditory features beyond mere additive superposition of the sound constituents.
To achieve this fusion, we employ inversion techniques that preserve essential
features of the original sample while enabling controllable synthesis. We
propose novel SDE and ODE inversion models based on DPMSolver++ samplers that
reverse the sampling process by configuring model outputs as constants,
eliminating circular dependencies incurred by noise prediction terms. Our
inversion approach requires no prompt conditioning while maintaining flexible
guidance during sampling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: V-ETS模型在神经喉科诊断等应用中具有潜力，但缺乏成对的EMG-语音数据限制了其发展。

Method: 利用预训练模型生成合成EMG数据，并通过基于音素级置信度的过滤机制增强自训练技术。

Result: 实验表明，该方法提高了音素准确性，减少了音素混淆，降低了词错误率。

Conclusion: CoM2S方法对V-ETS有效，并将公开代码和Libri-EMG数据集以支持未来研究。

Abstract: Voiced Electromyography (EMG)-to-Speech (V-ETS) models reconstruct speech
from muscle activity signals, facilitating applications such as
neurolaryngologic diagnostics. Despite its potential, the advancement of V-ETS
is hindered by a scarcity of paired EMG-speech data. To address this, we
propose a novel Confidence-based Multi-Speaker Self-training (CoM2S) approach,
along with a newly curated Libri-EMG dataset. This approach leverages synthetic
EMG data generated by a pre-trained model, followed by a proposed filtering
mechanism based on phoneme-level confidence to enhance the ETS model through
the proposed self-training techniques. Experiments demonstrate our method
improves phoneme accuracy, reduces phonological confusion, and lowers word
error rate, confirming the effectiveness of our CoM2S approach for V-ETS. In
support of future research, we will release the codes and the proposed
Libri-EMG dataset-an open-access, time-aligned, multi-speaker voiced EMG and
speech recordings.

Conclusion: 该系统重新定义了AI在表演艺术中的角色，作为响应式合作者，扩展了专业舞蹈和即兴艺术表达的可能性。

Abstract: Dance performance traditionally follows a unidirectional relationship where
movement responds to music. While AI has advanced in various creative domains,
its application in dance has primarily focused on generating choreography from
musical input. We present a system that enables dancers to dynamically shape
musical environments through their movements. Our multi-modal architecture
creates a coherent musical composition by intelligently combining pre-recorded
musical clips in response to dance movements, establishing a bidirectional
creative partnership where dancers function as both performers and composers.
Through correlation analysis of performance data, we demonstrate emergent
communication patterns between movement qualities and audio features. This
approach reconceptualizes the role of AI in performing arts as a responsive
collaborator that expands possibilities for both professional dance performance
and improvisational artistic expression across broader populations.

Motivation: 实践中预测概率很少完全多校准，需要一种统计量来衡量与完美多校准的距离。

Method: 基于Kuiper统计量设计新度量方法，避免分箱或核密度估计的问题，并通过信号噪声比加权子群体贡献。

Result: 数值实验表明，忽略信号噪声比会导致度量结果噪声增加。

Conclusion: 新提出的多校准度量方法有效且实用，适用于基准数据集。

Abstract: A suitable scalar metric can help measure multi-calibration, defined as
follows. When the expected values of observed responses are equal to
corresponding predicted probabilities, the probabilistic predictions are known
as "perfectly calibrated." When the predicted probabilities are perfectly
calibrated simultaneously across several subpopulations, the probabilistic
predictions are known as "perfectly multi-calibrated." In practice, predicted
probabilities are seldom perfectly multi-calibrated, so a statistic measuring
the distance from perfect multi-calibration is informative. A recently proposed
metric for calibration, based on the classical Kuiper statistic, is a natural
basis for a new metric of multi-calibration and avoids well-known problems of
metrics based on binning or kernel density estimation. The newly proposed
metric weights the contributions of different subpopulations in proportion to
their signal-to-noise ratios; data analyses' ablations demonstrate that the
metric becomes noisy when omitting the signal-to-noise ratios from the metric.
Numerical examples on benchmark data sets illustrate the new metric.

Conclusion: 通过似然函数分析，可以更好地理解意见动力学模型参数估计的局限与可能性，并为模型校准提供形式化保证。

Abstract: Opinion dynamics models such as the bounded confidence models (BCMs) describe
how a population can reach consensus, fragmentation, or polarization, depending
on a few parameters. Connecting such models to real-world data could help
understanding such phenomena, testing model assumptions. To this end,
estimation of model parameters is a key aspect, and maximum likelihood
estimation provides a principled way to tackle it. Here, our goal is to outline
the properties of statistical estimators of the two key BCM parameters: the
confidence bound and the convergence rate. We find that their maximum
likelihood estimators present different characteristics: the one for the
confidence bound presents a small-sample bias but is consistent, while the
estimator of the convergence rate shows a persistent bias. Moreover, the joint
parameter estimation is affected by identifiability issues for specific regions
of the parameter space, as several local maxima are present in the likelihood
function. Our results show how the analysis of the likelihood function is a
fruitful approach for better understanding the pitfalls and possibilities of
estimating the parameters of opinion dynamics models, and more in general,
agent-based models, and for offering formal guarantees for their calibration.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose practical normalized stochastic first-order methods
with Polyak momentum, multi-extrapolated momentum, and recursive momentum for
solving unconstrained optimization problems. These methods employ dynamically
updated algorithmic parameters and do not require explicit knowledge of
problem-dependent quantities such as the Lipschitz constant or noise bound. We
establish first-order oracle complexity results for finding approximate
stochastic stationary points under heavy-tailed noise and weakly average
smoothness conditions -- both of which are weaker than the commonly used
bounded variance and mean-squared smoothness assumptions. Our complexity bounds
either improve upon or match the best-known results in the literature.
Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the practical effectiveness
of the proposed methods.

Abstract: Price signals from distribution networks (DNs) guide energy communities (ECs)
to adjust energy usage, enabling effective coordination for reliable power
system operation. However, this coordination faces significant challenges due
to the limited availability of information (i.e., only the aggregated energy
usage of ECs is available to DNs), and the high computational burden of
accounting for uncertainties and the associated risks through numerous
scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a quantum learning and
estimation approach to enhance coordination between DNs and ECs. Specifically,
leveraging advanced quantum properties such as quantum superposition and
entanglement, we develop a hybrid quantum temporal convolutional network-long
short-term memory (Q-TCN-LSTM) model to establish an end-to-end mapping between
ECs' responses and the price incentives from DNs. Moreover, we develop a
quantum estimation method based on quantum amplitude estimation (QAE) and two
phase-rotation circuits to significantly accelerate the optimization process
under numerous uncertainty scenarios. Numerical experiments demonstrate that,
compared to classical neural networks, the proposed Q-TCN-LSTM model improves
the mapping accuracy by 69.2% while reducing the model size by 99.75% and the
computation time by 93.9%. Compared to classical Monte Carlo simulation, QAE
achieves comparable accuracy with a dramatic reduction in computational time
(up to 99.99%) and requires significantly fewer computational resources.

Conclusion: 该算法在理论和应用上均具有广泛适用性，为零阶方法提供了理论基础。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a unified algorithm for stochastic optimization
that makes use of a "momentum" term; in other words, the stochastic gradient
depends not only on the current true gradient of the objective function, but
also on the true gradient at the previous iteration. Our formulation includes
the Stochastic Heavy Ball (SHB) and the Stochastic Nesterov Accelerated
Gradient (SNAG) algorithms as special cases. In addition, in our formulation,
the momentum term is allowed to vary as a function of time (i.e., the iteration
counter). The assumptions on the stochastic gradient are the most general in
the literature, in that it can be biased, and have a conditional variance that
grows in an unbounded fashion as a function of time. This last feature is
crucial in order to make the theory applicable to "zero-order" methods, where
the gradient is estimated using just two function evaluations.
  We present a set of sufficient conditions for the convergence of the unified
algorithm. These conditions are natural generalizations of the familiar
Robbins-Monro and Kiefer-Wolfowitz-Blum conditions for standard stochastic
gradient descent. We also analyze another method from the literature for the
SHB algorithm with a time-varying momentum parameter, and show that it is
impracticable.

Abstract: In the age of generative AI and ubiquitous digital tools, human cognition
faces a structural paradox: as external aids become more capable, internal
memory systems risk atrophy. Drawing on neuroscience and cognitive psychology,
this paper examines how heavy reliance on AI systems and discovery-based
pedagogies may impair the consolidation of declarative and procedural memory --
systems essential for expertise, critical thinking, and long-term retention. We
review how tools like ChatGPT and calculators can short-circuit the retrieval,
error correction, and schema-building processes necessary for robust neural
encoding. Notably, we highlight striking parallels between deep learning
phenomena such as "grokking" and the neuroscience of overlearning and
intuition. Empirical studies are discussed showing how premature reliance on AI
during learning inhibits proceduralization and intuitive mastery. We argue that
effective human-AI interaction depends on strong internal models -- biological
"schemata" and neural manifolds -- that enable users to evaluate, refine, and
guide AI output. The paper concludes with policy implications for education and
workforce training in the age of large language models.

operations. Through analysis of empirical evidence, economic frameworks, and
organizational case studies, we demonstrate that proprietary multimodal
foundation models enable healthcare organizations to achieve superior clinical
performance, maintain robust data governance, create sustainable competitive
advantages, and accelerate innovation pathways. While acknowledging
implementation challenges, we present evidence showing organizations with
proprietary AI capabilities demonstrate measurably improved outcomes, faster
innovation cycles, and stronger strategic positioning in the evolving
healthcare ecosystem. This analysis provides healthcare leaders with a
comprehensive framework for evaluating build-versus-buy decisions regarding
foundation model implementation, positioning proprietary foundation model
development as a cornerstone capability for forward-thinking healthcare

TL;DR: AI研究人员和公众对具有主观体验的AI系统的出现持开放态度，但对其时间线和应对措施存在分歧。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI系统是否可能具备主观体验及其治理问题。

Method: 调查582名AI研究人员和838名美国公众的观点。

Result: 多数人认为本世纪可能出现此类AI系统，但对时间线和治理措施存在分歧。

Conclusion: 需提前制定保障措施，但具体实施仍需进一步讨论。

Abstract: We surveyed 582 AI researchers who have published in leading AI venues and
838 nationally representative US participants about their views on the
potential development of AI systems with subjective experience and how such
systems should be treated and governed. When asked to estimate the chances that
such systems will exist on specific dates, the median responses were 1% (AI
researchers) and 5% (public) by 2024, 25% and 30% by 2034, and 70% and 60% by
2100, respectively. The median member of the public thought there was a higher
chance that AI systems with subjective experience would never exist (25%) than
the median AI researcher did (10%). Both groups perceived a need for
multidisciplinary expertise to assess AI subjective experience. Although
support for welfare protections for such AI systems exceeded opposition, it
remained far lower than support for protections for animals or the environment.
Attitudes toward moral and governance issues were divided in both groups,
especially regarding whether such systems should be created and what rights or
protections they should receive. Yet a majority of respondents in both groups
agreed that safeguards against the potential risks from AI systems with
subjective experience should be implemented by AI developers now, and if
created, AI systems with subjective experience should treat others well, behave
ethically, and be held accountable. Overall, these results suggest that both AI
researchers and the public regard the emergence of AI systems with subjective
experience as a possibility this century, though substantial uncertainty and
disagreement remain about the timeline and appropriate response.

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: 论文研究了基于物理信息的神经网络（PINNs）在三维低频室内声学中的应用，探讨了源定义、边界条件和复声速模型对收敛行为的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究PINNs在解决声波场偏微分方程中的应用，尤其是在复杂几何和三维场景中的表现，以改进现有数值模型的局限性。

Method: 通过改变源定义、边界条件集的数量，并使用复声速模型来模拟吸收效应，评估PINN的收敛行为，包括损失景观和$L^2$误差。

Result: 研究表明，至少需要每个波长六个训练点才能实现PINN的准确训练和预测。

Conclusion: 该研究为低频室内声学建模提供了新方法，并为未来包括吸声体的研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Studying physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for modeling partial
differential equations to solve the acoustic wave field has produced promising
results for simple geometries in two-dimensional domains. One option is to
compute the time-harmonic wave field using the Helmholtz equation. Compared to
existing numerical models, the physics-informed neural networks forward problem
has to overcome several topics related to the convergence of the optimization
toward the "true" solution. The topics reach from considering the physical
dimensionality (from 2D to 3D), the modeling of realistic sources (from a
self-similar source to a realistic confined point source), the modeling of
sound-hard (Neumann) boundary conditions, and the modeling of the full wave
field by considering the complex solution quantities. Within this contribution,
we study 3D room acoustic cases at low frequency, varying the source definition
and the number of boundary condition sets and using a complex speed of sound
model to account for some degree of absorption. We assess the convergence
behavior by looking at the loss landscape of the PINN architecture, the $L^2$
error compared to a finite element reference simulation for each network
architecture and configuration. The convergence studies showed that at least
six training points per wavelength are necessary for accurate training and
subsequent predictions of the PINN. The developments are part of an initiative
aiming to model the low-frequency behavior of room acoustics, including
absorbers.

Conclusion: CLEAN-MI为构建高质量MI-BCI数据集提供了可扩展且系统化的解决方案。

Abstract: The construction of large-scale, high-quality datasets is a fundamental
prerequisite for developing robust and generalizable foundation models in motor
imagery (MI)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). However, EEG signals
collected from different subjects and devices are often plagued by low
signal-to-noise ratio, heterogeneity in electrode configurations, and
substantial inter-subject variability, posing significant challenges for
effective model training. In this paper, we propose CLEAN-MI, a scalable and
systematic data construction pipeline for constructing large-scale, efficient,
and accurate neurodata in the MI paradigm. CLEAN-MI integrates frequency band
filtering, channel template selection, subject screening, and marginal
distribution alignment to systematically filter out irrelevant or low-quality
data and standardize multi-source EEG datasets. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of CLEAN-MI on multiple public MI datasets, achieving consistent
improvements in data quality and classification performance.

Abstract: Self-organising systems demonstrate how simple local rules can generate
complex stochastic patterns. Many natural systems rely on such dynamics, making
self-organisation central to understanding natural complexity. A fundamental
challenge in modelling such systems is solving the inverse problem: finding the
unknown causal parameters from macroscopic observations. This task becomes
particularly difficult when observations have a strong stochastic component,
yielding diverse yet equivalent patterns. Traditional inverse methods fail in
this setting, as pixel-wise metrics cannot capture feature similarities between
variable outcomes. In this work, we introduce a novel inverse modelling method
specifically designed to handle stochasticity in the observable space,
leveraging the capacity of visual embeddings to produce robust representations
that capture perceptual invariances. By mapping the pattern representations
onto an invariant embedding space, we can effectively recover unknown causal
parameters without the need for handcrafted objective functions or heuristics.
We evaluate the method on two canonical models--a reaction-diffusion system and
an agent-based model of social segregation--and show that it reliably recovers
parameters despite stochasticity in the outcomes. We further apply the method
to real biological patterns, highlighting its potential as a tool for both
theorists and experimentalists to investigate the dynamics underlying complex
stochastic pattern formation.

Abstract: A central idea in understanding brains and building artificial intelligence
is that structure determines function. Yet, how the brain's complex structure
arises from a limited set of genetic instructions remains a key question. The
ultra high-dimensional detail of neural connections vastly exceeds the
information storage capacity of genes, suggesting a compact, low-dimensional
blueprint must guide brain development. Our motivation is to uncover this
blueprint. We introduce a generative model, to learn this underlying
representation from detailed connectivity maps of mouse cortical microcircuits.
Our model successfully captures the essential structural information of these
circuits in a compressed latent space. We found that specific, interpretable
directions within this space directly relate to understandable network
properties. Building on this, we demonstrate a novel method to controllably
generate new, synthetic microcircuits with desired structural features by
navigating this latent space. This work offers a new way to investigate the
design principles of neural circuits and explore how structure gives rise to
function, potentially informing the development of more advanced artificial
neural networks.

Motivation: 研究旨在建立深度学习模型与人类视觉皮层之间的直接联系，以增强模型的可解释性。

Method: 使用SAE对模型激活进行分层训练，计算SAE单元与fMRI信号的相似性，构建体素字典，并可视化信息转换。

Result: 发现ViT-B/16$_{CLIP}$在早期层利用低级信息生成高级语义信息，后期重建低维信息，相似性最高达0.76。

Conclusion: SAE-BrainMap为深度学习模型与人类视觉皮层之间提供了无下游任务的桥梁，提升了模型的可解释性。

Abstract: We present SAE-BrainMap, a novel framework that directly aligns deep learning
visual model representations with voxel-level fMRI responses using sparse
autoencoders (SAEs). First, we train layer-wise SAEs on model activations and
compute the correlations between SAE unit activations and cortical fMRI signals
elicited by the same natural image stimuli with cosine similarity, revealing
strong activation correspondence (maximum similarity up to 0.76). Depending on
this alignment, we construct a voxel dictionary by optimally assigning the most
similar SAE feature to each voxel, demonstrating that SAE units preserve the
functional structure of predefined regions of interest (ROIs) and exhibit
ROI-consistent selectivity. Finally, we establish fine-grained hierarchical
mapping between model layers and the human ventral visual pathway, also by
projecting voxel dictionary activations onto individual cortical surfaces, we
visualize the dynamic transformation of the visual information in deep learning
models. It is found that ViT-B/16$_{CLIP}$ tends to utilize low-level
information to generate high-level semantic information in the early layers and
reconstructs the low-dimension information later. Our results establish a
direct, downstream-task-free bridge between deep neural networks and human
visual cortex, offering new insights into model interpretability.

Conclusion: 研究表明Swin Transformer能高效学习大脑的时空组织，为减少fMRI扫描时间和开发脑机接口提供了潜力。

Abstract: Understanding brain dynamics is important for neuroscience and mental health.
Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) enables the measurement of neural
activities through blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals, which represent
brain states. In this study, we aim to predict future human resting brain
states with fMRI. Due to the 3D voxel-wise spatial organization and temporal
dependencies of the fMRI data, we propose a novel architecture which employs a
4D Shifted Window (Swin) Transformer as encoder to efficiently learn
spatio-temporal information and a convolutional decoder to enable brain state
prediction at the same spatial and temporal resolution as the input fMRI data.
We used 100 unrelated subjects from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) for
model training and testing. Our novel model has shown high accuracy when
predicting 7.2s resting-state brain activities based on the prior 23.04s fMRI
time series. The predicted brain states highly resemble BOLD contrast and
dynamics. This work shows promising evidence that the spatiotemporal
organization of the human brain can be learned by a Swin Transformer model, at
high resolution, which provides a potential for reducing the fMRI scan time and
the development of brain-computer interfaces in the future.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于音素增强的多模态融合方法（PMF-CEC），用于改进ASR后处理中的罕见词识别，特别是在发音相似但拼写不同的情况下。通过引入保留概率机制，进一步提高了错误检测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的ED-CEC方法在纠正罕见词时表现良好，但对发音相似但拼写不同的词识别准确率较低。此外，错误检测模块存在过度检测的问题。

Method: 提出PMF-CEC方法，结合音素信息增强多模态融合，并引入保留概率机制过滤低置信度的编辑操作。

Result: 在五个数据集上的实验表明，PMF-CEC在保持合理推理速度的同时，进一步降低了偏置词错误率，尤其在纠正同音词方面表现更优。

Conclusion: PMF-CEC在罕见词识别和同音词纠正方面优于现有方法，且在推理速度和鲁棒性上优于基于LLM的方法。

Abstract: End-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) models often struggle to
accurately recognize rare words. Previously, we introduced an ASR
postprocessing method called error detection and context-aware error correction
(ED-CEC), which leverages contextual information such as named entities and
technical terms to improve the accuracy of ASR transcripts. Although ED-CEC
achieves a notable success in correcting rare words, its accuracy remains low
when dealing with rare words that have similar pronunciations but different
spellings. To address this issue, we proposed a phoneme-augmented multimodal
fusion method for context-aware error correction (PMF-CEC) method on the basis
of ED-CEC, which allowed for better differentiation between target rare words
and homophones. Additionally, we observed that the previous ASR error detection
module suffers from overdetection. To mitigate this, we introduced a retention
probability mechanism to filter out editing operations with confidence scores
below a set threshold, preserving the original operation to improve error
detection accuracy. Experiments conducted on five datasets demonstrated that
our proposed PMF-CEC maintains reasonable inference speed while further
reducing the biased word error rate compared with ED-CEC, showing a stronger
advantage in correcting homophones. Moreover, our method outperforms other
contextual biasing methods, and remains valuable compared with LLM-based
methods in terms of faster inference and better robustness under large biasing
lists.

Motivation: 构音障碍和老年语音识别的准确性仍具挑战性，而隐私问题促使从集中式方法转向联邦学习，但数据稀缺、分布不均和说话者异质性进一步加剧了挑战。

Method: 采用参数、嵌入和损失正则化方法，在联邦学习的不同层次进行优化。

Result: 在UASpeech和DementiaBank数据集上，正则化FL系统显著优于基线FedAvg系统，WER绝对降低0.55%（相对2.13%）。

Conclusion: 正则化FL方法有效提升了语音识别性能，且增加通信频率可接近集中式训练效果。

Abstract: Accurate recognition of dysarthric and elderly speech remains challenging to
date. While privacy concerns have driven a shift from centralized approaches to
federated learning (FL) to ensure data confidentiality, this further
exacerbates the challenges of data scarcity, imbalanced data distribution and
speaker heterogeneity. To this end, this paper conducts a systematic
investigation of regularized FL techniques for privacy-preserving dysarthric
and elderly speech recognition, addressing different levels of the FL process
by 1) parameter-based, 2) embedding-based and 3) novel loss-based
regularization. Experiments on the benchmark UASpeech dysarthric and
DementiaBank Pitt elderly speech corpora suggest that regularized FL systems
consistently outperform the baseline FedAvg system by statistically significant
WER reductions of up to 0.55\% absolute (2.13\% relative). Further increasing
communication frequency to one exchange per batch approaches centralized
training performance.

Result: 不同工具提取的特征存在显著差异，影响模型在不同情境和人群中的表现。

Conclusion: 建议进行领域相关验证，以提高机器学习模型在临床应用中的可靠性。

Abstract: Machine learning-based behavioral models rely on features extracted from
audio-visual recordings. The recordings are processed using open-source tools
to extract speech features for classification models. These tools often lack
validation to ensure reliability in capturing behaviorally relevant
information. This gap raises concerns about reproducibility and fairness across
diverse populations and contexts. Speech processing tools, when used outside of
their design context, can fail to capture behavioral variations equitably and
can then contribute to bias. We evaluate speech features extracted from two
widely used speech analysis tools, OpenSMILE and Praat, to assess their
reliability when considering adolescents with autism. We observed considerable
variation in features across tools, which influenced model performance across
context and demographic groups. We encourage domain-relevant verification to
enhance the reliability of machine learning models in clinical applications.

This paper summarizes collective knowledge on this technique, providing entry

metrics to help users assess data quality. While a fully automated quality

Conclusion: 论文为处理间歇性和移动声源跟踪问题提供了新的数据集和度量方法，填补了研究空白。

Abstract: This paper presents the problem of tracking intermittent and moving sources,
i.e, sources that may change position when they are inactive. This issue is
seldom explored, and most current tracking methods rely on spatial observations
for track identity management. They are either based on a previous localization
step, or designed to perform joint localization and tracking by predicting
ordered position estimates. This raises concerns about whether such methods can
maintain reliable track identity assignment performance when dealing with
discontinuous spatial tracks, which may be caused by a change of direction
during silence. We introduce LibriJump, a novel dataset of acoustic scenes in
the First Order Ambisonics format focusing on speaker tracking. The dataset
contains speakers with changing positions during inactivity periods, thus
simulating discontinuous tracks. To measure the identity assignment
performance, we propose to use tracking association metrics adapted from the
computer vision community. We provide experiments showing the complementarity
of association metrics with previously used tracking metrics, given continuous
and discontinuous spatial tracks.

Result: 在CVSS基准测试中优于现有方法，同时保持低延迟。

Conclusion: S2ST-Omni框架高效且可扩展，具有实际部署潜力。

Abstract: Multilingual speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) aims to directly convert
spoken utterances from multiple source languages into natural and intelligible
speech in a target language. Despite recent progress, significant challenges
remain: (1) achieving high-quality and low-latency S2ST remains a critical
hurdle; (2) existing S2ST approaches heavily rely on large-scale parallel
speech corpora, which are extremely difficult to collect. To address these
issues, we propose S2ST-Omni, an efficient and scalable framework for
multilingual speech-to-speech translation. Specifically, we decompose the S2ST
task into speech-to-text translation (S2TT) and text-to-speech synthesis (TTS),
unifying them within a single end-to-end speech-language model. To achieve
high-quality S2TT while reducing dependence on parallel corpora, we leverage
large-scale pretrained models -- Whisper for audio understanding and Qwen 3.0
for text understanding. A lightweight speech adapter is introduced to align
speech and text representations, enabling effective use of pretrained
multimodal knowledge. To ensure both translation quality and real-time
performance, we adopt a pretrained streaming speech decoder in the TTS stage to
generate target speech in an autoregressive manner. Extensive experiments on
the CVSS benchmark demonstrate that S2ST-Omni outperforms state-of-the-art S2ST
baselines while maintaining comparable latency, highlighting its effectiveness
and practical potential for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Small-Footprint Keyword Spotting (SF-KWS) has gained popularity in today's
landscape of smart voice-activated devices, smartphones, and Internet of Things
(IoT) applications. This surge is attributed to the advancements in Deep
Learning, enabling the identification of predefined words or keywords from a
continuous stream of words. To implement the SF-KWS model on edge devices with
low power and limited memory in real-world scenarios, a efficient Tiny Machine
Learning (TinyML) framework is essential. In this study, we explore seven
distinct categories of techniques namely, Model Architecture, Learning
Techniques, Model Compression, Attention Awareness Architecture, Feature
Optimization, Neural Network Search, and Hybrid Approaches, which are suitable
for developing an SF-KWS system. This comprehensive overview will serve as a
valuable resource for those looking to understand, utilize, or contribute to
the field of SF-KWS. The analysis conducted in this work enables the
identification of numerous potential research directions, encompassing insights
from automatic speech recognition research and those specifically pertinent to
the realm of spoken SF-KWS.

Motivation: 传统语音增强方法依赖时频掩蔽或信号预测，本文探索了利用预训练模型的音频嵌入特征实现高效且可扩展的语音增强。

Method: 方法包括：1）用预训练音频编码器提取噪声语音的嵌入特征；2）通过紧凑编码网络去噪；3）用声码器从去噪后的嵌入特征合成清晰语音。

Result: 实验证明，该方法在语音增强和说话人保真度上优于基于判别性音频编码器的模型，主观听测也显示其感知质量优于现有最优模型。

Conclusion: 本文提出的生成性音频编码器语音增强系统高效且性能优越，为语音增强提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent research has delved into speech enhancement (SE) approaches that
leverage audio embeddings from pre-trained models, diverging from
time-frequency masking or signal prediction techniques. This paper introduces
an efficient and extensible SE method. Our approach involves initially
extracting audio embeddings from noisy speech using a pre-trained audioencoder,
which are then denoised by a compact encoder network. Subsequently, a vocoder
synthesizes the clean speech from denoised embeddings. An ablation study
substantiates the parameter efficiency of the denoise encoder with a
pre-trained audioencoder and vocoder. Experimental results on both speech
enhancement and speaker fidelity demonstrate that our generative
audioencoder-based SE system outperforms models utilizing discriminative
audioencoders. Furthermore, subjective listening tests validate that our
proposed system surpasses an existing state-of-the-art SE model in terms of
perceptual quality.

Motivation: 语音深度伪造检测中泛化能力不足是一个关键挑战，缺乏理论框架解释模型性能。

Method: 通过分析锐度对领域变化的响应，并应用锐度感知最小化（SAM）来显式降低锐度。

Result: 发现锐度在未见条件下增加，表明模型敏感性提高；SAM显著提升了模型在多样化测试集上的性能和稳定性。

Conclusion: 锐度可作为SDD中泛化的理论指标，锐度感知训练是提高鲁棒性的有效策略。

Abstract: Generalization remains a critical challenge in speech deepfake detection
(SDD). While various approaches aim to improve robustness, generalization is
typically assessed through performance metrics like equal error rate without a
theoretical framework to explain model performance. This work investigates
sharpness as a theoretical proxy for generalization in SDD. We analyze how
sharpness responds to domain shifts and find it increases in unseen conditions,
indicating higher model sensitivity. Based on this, we apply Sharpness-Aware
Minimization (SAM) to reduce sharpness explicitly, leading to better and more
stable performance across diverse unseen test sets. Furthermore, correlation
analysis confirms a statistically significant relationship between sharpness
and generalization in most test settings. These findings suggest that sharpness
can serve as a theoretical indicator for generalization in SDD and that
sharpness-aware training offers a promising strategy for improving robustness.

Motivation: 目前对TTS模型处理MX能力的评估有限，需填补这一研究空白。

Method: 通过听力和转录测试评估五种TTS模型，使用LLM生成MX的英文发音，并采用用户评分和转录正确率量化结果。

Result: TTS模型输出在MX上的可理解性较差，表现显著低于专家朗读，且LLM选择影响有限。

Conclusion: 需改进TTS模型以更好地处理MX。

Abstract: There has been limited evaluation of advanced Text-to-Speech (TTS) models
with Mathematical eXpressions (MX) as inputs. In this work, we design
experiments to evaluate quality and intelligibility of five TTS models through
listening and transcribing tests for various categories of MX. We use two Large
Language Models (LLMs) to generate English pronunciation from LaTeX MX as TTS
models cannot process LaTeX directly. We use Mean Opinion Score from user
ratings and quantify intelligibility through transcription correctness using
three metrics. We also compare listener preference of TTS outputs with respect
to human expert rendition of same MX. Results establish that output of TTS
models for MX is not necessarily intelligible, the gap in intelligibility
varies across TTS models and MX category. For most categories, performance of
TTS models is significantly worse than that of expert rendition. The effect of
choice of LLM is limited. This establishes the need to improve TTS models for
MX.

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了传统方法的局限性，为ASR训练提供了更高质量的伪标签。

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) models rely on high-quality transcribed
data for effective training. Generating pseudo-labels for large unlabeled audio
datasets often relies on complex pipelines that combine multiple ASR outputs
through multi-stage processing, leading to error propagation, information loss
and disjoint optimization. We propose a unified multi-ASR prompt-driven
framework using postprocessing by either textual or speech-based large language
models (LLMs), replacing voting or other arbitration logic for reconciling the
ensemble outputs. We perform a comparative study of multiple architectures with
and without LLMs, showing significant improvements in transcription accuracy
compared to traditional methods. Furthermore, we use the pseudo-labels
generated by the various approaches to train semi-supervised ASR models for
different datasets, again showing improved performance with textual and
speechLLM transcriptions compared to baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究全球森林地上碳（AGC）的长期动态及其碳汇-碳源转变，以解决因干扰机制变化和观测方法不一致导致的不确定性。

Method: 通过整合多源卫星观测数据和概率深度学习模型，估算高空间分辨率的全球森林AGC及其不确定性。

Result: 全球森林30年间总体为碳汇（6.2 PgC），但热带湿润森林和北方森林逐渐转为碳源；热带森林的碳汇-碳源转变显著，巴西亚马逊未受干扰区域的碳损失占比增加。

Conclusion: 热带森林AGC在调节陆地碳循环中的作用增强，人为气候变化可能对未受干扰区域的AGC变化贡献越来越大。

Abstract: As enduring carbon sinks, forest ecosystems are vital to the terrestrial
carbon cycle and help moderate global warming. However, the long-term dynamics
of aboveground carbon (AGC) in forests and their sink-source transitions remain
highly uncertain, owing to changing disturbance regimes and inconsistencies in
observations, data processing, and analysis methods. Here, we derive reliable,
harmonized AGC stocks and fluxes in global forests from 1988 to 2021 at high
spatial resolution by integrating multi-source satellite observations with
probabilistic deep learning models. Our approach simultaneously estimates AGC
and associated uncertainties, showing high reliability across space and time.
We find that, although global forests remained an AGC sink of 6.2 PgC over 30
years, moist tropical forests shifted to a substantial AGC source between 2001
and 2010 and, together with boreal forests, transitioned toward a source in the
2011-2021 period. Temperate, dry tropical and subtropical forests generally
exhibited increasing AGC stocks, although Europe and Australia became sources
after 2011. Regionally, pronounced sink-to-source transitions occurred in
tropical forests over the past three decades. The interannual relationship
between global atmospheric CO2 growth rates and tropical AGC flux variability
became increasingly negative, reaching Pearson's r = -0.63 (p < 0.05) in the
most recent decade. In the Brazilian Amazon, the contribution of deforested
regions to AGC losses declined from 60% in 1989-2000 to 13% in 2011-2021, while
the share from untouched areas increased from 33% to 76%. Our findings suggest
a growing role of tropical forest AGC in modulating variability in the
terrestrial carbon cycle, with anthropogenic climate change potentially
contributing increasingly to AGC changes, particularly in previously untouched
areas.

Motivation: 手动制定HDR近距离放射治疗计划依赖专家经验，效率低且一致性差，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：第一阶段用DQN强化学习代理选择治疗参数，第二阶段用Adam优化器计算停留时间分布。

Result: 在复杂患者几何中，框架表现优异，测试患者平均得分93.89%，优于临床计划的91.86%。

Conclusion: 该框架能生成临床可接受的计划，同时保持靶区覆盖并减少热点，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: High-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy plays a critical role in the treatment of
locally advanced cervical cancer but remains highly dependent on manual
treatment planning expertise. The objective of this study is to develop a fully
automated HDR brachytherapy planning framework that integrates reinforcement
learning (RL) and dose-based optimization to generate clinically acceptable
treatment plans with improved consistency and efficiency. We propose a
hierarchical two-stage autoplanning framework. In the first stage, a deep
Q-network (DQN)-based RL agent iteratively selects treatment planning
parameters (TPPs), which control the trade-offs between target coverage and
organ-at-risk (OAR) sparing. The agent's state representation includes both
dose-volume histogram (DVH) metrics and current TPP values, while its reward
function incorporates clinical dose objectives and safety constraints,
including D90, V150, V200 for targets, and D2cc for all relevant OARs (bladder,
rectum, sigmoid, small bowel, and large bowel). In the second stage, a
customized Adam-based optimizer computes the corresponding dwell time
distribution for the selected TPPs using a clinically informed loss function.
The framework was evaluated on a cohort of patients with complex applicator
geometries. The proposed framework successfully learned clinically meaningful
TPP adjustments across diverse patient anatomies. For the unseen test patients,
the RL-based automated planning method achieved an average score of 93.89%,
outperforming the clinical plans which averaged 91.86%. These findings are
notable given that score improvements were achieved while maintaining full
target coverage and reducing CTV hot spots in most cases.

Conclusion: 对称自编码器的理论分析为实际应用提供了更坚实的数学基础，EYS初始化策略显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Deep autoencoders have become a fundamental tool in various machine learning
applications, ranging from dimensionality reduction and reduced order modeling
of partial differential equations to anomaly detection and neural machine
translation. Despite their empirical success, a solid theoretical foundation
for their expressiveness remains elusive, particularly when compared to
classical projection-based techniques. In this work, we aim to take a step
forward in this direction by presenting a comprehensive analysis of what we
refer to as symmetric autoencoders, a broad class of deep learning
architectures ubiquitous in the literature. Specifically, we introduce a formal
distinction between different classes of symmetric architectures, analyzing
their strengths and limitations from a mathematical perspective. For instance,
we show that the reconstruction error of symmetric autoencoders with
orthonormality constraints can be understood by leveraging the well-renowned
Eckart-Young-Schmidt (EYS) theorem. As a byproduct of our analysis, we end up
developing the EYS initialization strategy for symmetric autoencoders, which is
based on an iterated application of the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). To
validate our findings, we conduct a series of numerical experiments where we
benchmark our proposal against conventional deep autoencoders, discussing the
importance of model design and initialization.

Result: 数据驱动方法在逆问题中展现出前所未有的精度和计算效率。

Conclusion: 论文总结了数据驱动方法的优势，并提出了该领域的开放问题和未来展望。

Abstract: Inverse problems are concerned with the reconstruction of unknown physical
quantities using indirect measurements and are fundamental across diverse
fields such as medical imaging, remote sensing, and material sciences. These
problems serve as critical tools for visualizing internal structures beyond
what is visible to the naked eye, enabling quantification, diagnosis,
prediction, and discovery. However, most inverse problems are ill-posed,
necessitating robust mathematical treatment to yield meaningful solutions.
While classical approaches provide mathematically rigorous and computationally
stable solutions, they are constrained by the ability to accurately model
solution properties and implement them efficiently.
  A more recent paradigm considers deriving solutions to inverse problems in a
data-driven manner. Instead of relying on classical mathematical modeling, this
approach utilizes highly over-parameterized models, typically deep neural
networks, which are adapted to specific inverse problems using carefully
selected training data. Current approaches that follow this new paradigm
distinguish themselves through solution accuracy paired with computational
efficiency that was previously inconceivable.
  These notes offer an introduction to this data-driven paradigm for inverse
problems. The first part of these notes will provide an introduction to inverse
problems, discuss classical solution strategies, and present some applications.
The second part will delve into modern data-driven approaches, with a
particular focus on adversarial regularization and provably convergent linear
plug-and-play denoisers. Throughout the presentation of these methodologies,
their theoretical properties will be discussed, and numerical examples will be
provided. The lecture series will conclude with a discussion of open problems
and future perspectives in the field.

Abstract: As AI tools proliferate across domains, from chatbots and copilots to
emerging agents, they increasingly support professional knowledge work. Yet
despite their growing capabilities, these systems remain fragmented: they
assist with isolated tasks but lack the architectural scaffolding for
sustained, adaptive collaboration. We propose a layered framework for
human-agent systems that integrates three interdependent dimensions:
interaction, process, and infrastructure. Crucially, our architecture elevates
process to a primary focus by making it explicit, inspectable, and adaptable,
enabling humans and agents to align with evolving goals and coordinate over
time. This model clarifies limitations of current tools, unifies emerging
system design approaches, and reveals new opportunities for researchers and AI
system builders. By grounding intelligent behavior in structured collaboration,
we reimagine human-agent collaboration not as task-specific augmentation, but
as a form of coherent and aligned system for real-world work.

Abstract: Virtual Reality simulators offer a powerful tool for teacher training, yet
the integration of AI-powered student avatars presents a critical challenge:
determining the optimal level of avatar realism for effective pedagogy. This
literature review examines the evolution of avatar realism in VR teacher
training, synthesizes its theoretical implications, and proposes a new
pedagogical framework to guide future design. Through a systematic review, this
paper traces the progression from human-controlled avatars to generative AI
prototypes. Applying learning theories like Cognitive Load Theory, we argue
that hyper-realism is not always optimal, as high-fidelity avatars can impose
excessive extraneous cognitive load on novices, a stance supported by recent
empirical findings. A significant gap exists between the technological drive
for photorealism and the pedagogical need for scaffolded learning. To address
this gap, we propose Graduated Realism, a framework advocating for starting
trainees with lower-fidelity avatars and progressively increasing behavioral
complexity as skills develop. To make this computationally feasible, we outline
a novel single-call architecture, Crazy Slots, which uses a probabilistic
engine and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation database to generate authentic,
real-time responses without the latency and cost of multi-step reasoning
models. This review provides evidence-based principles for designing the next
generation of AI simulators, arguing that a pedagogically grounded approach to
realism is essential for creating scalable and effective teacher education
tools.

Result: AA-2DGS显著提升了渲染质量，消除了高频伪影。

Conclusion: AA-2DGS在保持几何优势的同时，有效解决了2DGS的锯齿问题。

Abstract: 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) has recently emerged as a promising method for
novel view synthesis and surface reconstruction, offering better
view-consistency and geometric accuracy than volumetric 3DGS. However, 2DGS
suffers from severe aliasing artifacts when rendering at different sampling
rates than those used during training, limiting its practical applications in
scenarios requiring camera zoom or varying fields of view. We identify that
these artifacts stem from two key limitations: the lack of frequency
constraints in the representation and an ineffective screen-space clamping
approach. To address these issues, we present AA-2DGS, an antialiased
formulation of 2D Gaussian Splatting that maintains its geometric benefits
while significantly enhancing rendering quality across different scales. Our
method introduces a world space flat smoothing kernel that constrains the
frequency content of 2D Gaussian primitives based on the maximal sampling
frequency from training views, effectively eliminating high-frequency artifacts
when zooming in. Additionally, we derive a novel object space Mip filter by
leveraging an affine approximation of the ray-splat intersection mapping, which
allows us to efficiently apply proper anti-aliasing directly in the local space
of each splat.

Abstract: While existing video and image quality datasets have extensively studied
natural videos and traditional distortions, the perception of synthetic content
and modern rendering artifacts remains underexplored. We present a novel video
quality dataset focused on distortions introduced by advanced rendering
techniques, including neural supersampling, novel-view synthesis, path tracing,
neural denoising, frame interpolation, and variable rate shading. Our
evaluations show that existing full-reference quality metrics perform
sub-optimally on these distortions, with a maximum Pearson correlation of 0.78.
Additionally, we find that the feature space of pre-trained 3D CNNs aligns
strongly with human perception of visual quality. We propose CGVQM, a
full-reference video quality metric that significantly outperforms existing
metrics while generating both per-pixel error maps and global quality scores.

Abstract: Research on lane change prediction has gained a lot of momentum in the last
couple of years. However, most research is confined to simulation or results
obtained from datasets, leaving a gap between algorithmic advances and on-road
deployment. This work closes that gap by demonstrating, on real hardware, a
lane-change prediction system based on Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGEs) and
Bayesian inference. Moreover, the ego-vehicle employs a longitudinal braking
action to ensure the safety of both itself and the surrounding vehicles. Our
architecture consists of two modules: (i) a perception module that senses the
environment, derives input numerical features, and converts them into
linguistic categories; and communicates them to the prediction module; (ii) a
pretrained prediction module that executes a KGE and Bayesian inference model
to anticipate the target vehicle's maneuver and transforms the prediction into
longitudinal braking action. Real-world hardware experimental validation
demonstrates that our prediction system anticipates the target vehicle's lane
change three to four seconds in advance, providing the ego vehicle sufficient
time to react and allowing the target vehicle to make the lane change safely.

Conclusion: DPUV4E设计显著提升了Versal架构的性能和能效，适用于多种计算机视觉模型。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) remain prevalent in computer vision
applications, and FPGAs, known for their flexibility and energy efficiency,
have become essential components in heterogeneous acceleration systems.
However, traditional FPGAs face challenges in balancing performance and
versatility due to limited on-chip resources. AMD's Versal ACAP architecture,
tailored for AI applications, incorporates AI Engines (AIEs) to deliver high
computational power. Nevertheless, the platform suffers from insufficient
memory bandwidth, hindering the full utilization of the AIEs' theoretical
performance. In this paper, we present DPUV4E for the Versal architecture,
providing configurations ranging from 2PE ($32.6$ TOPS) to 8PE ($131.0$ TOPS).
We design two computation units, Conv PE and DWC PE, to support different
computational patterns. Each computation unit's data flow efficiently utilizes
the data reuse opportunities to mitigate bandwidth bottlenecks. Additionally,
we extend the functionality of each PE to utilize AIEs for non-convolutional
operations, reducing resource overhead. Experiments on over 50 models show that
compared to previous designs, our design provides $8.6\times$ the TOPS/W of
traditional FPGA-based DPU designs, while reducing DSP usage by $95.8\%$, LUT
usage by $44.7\%$, and latency to $68.5\%$ under single-batch conditions. For
end-to-end inference, our design improving throughput by up to $2.2\times$ for
depth-wise convolution models and up to $1.3\times$ for standard models.

Abstract: AI-assisted code generation tools have revolutionized software development,
offering unprecedented efficiency and scalability. However, multiple studies
have consistently highlighted challenges such as security vulnerabilities,
reliability issues, and inconsistencies in the generated code. Addressing these
concerns is crucial to unlocking the full potential of this transformative

The proposed framework integrates these capabilities with human expertise to
tackle application modernization challenges effectively. It highlights the
indispensable role of human involvement and guidance in ensuring the success of
AI-assisted processes.
  To demonstrate the framework's utility, this paper presents a detailed case
study, walking through its application in a real-world scenario. The analysis
includes a step-by-step breakdown, assessing alternative approaches where
applicable. This work aims to provide actionable insights and a robust
foundation for future research in AI-driven application modernization. The

LLMs using the HumanEval dataset, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms
widely studied zero-shot and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methods in terms of the
Pass@k metric. Furthermore, our method achieves these improvements with
significantly reduced token usage compared to the CoT approach, making it both
effective and resource-efficient, thereby lowering the computational demands
and improving the eco-footprint of LLM capabilities. These findings highlight
the potential of tailored prompting strategies to optimize code generation
performance, paving the way for broader applications in AI-driven programming

*Roberto Vergallo,Luís Cruz,Alessio Errico,Luca Mainetti*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文提出‘Follow-the-Sun’（FtS）计算模型以减少AI工作负载的碳足迹，并通过实验验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI的高能耗问题引发广泛讨论，但缺乏科学证据支持FtS在减少碳足迹方面的优势。

Method: 在部分合成场景中，对比了四种AI算法在异常检测领域的碳足迹差异，包括无策略、FtS及两种现有策略。

Result: FtS策略平均减少14.6%的碳排放（峰值16.3%），同时保持训练时间。

Conclusion: FtS是一种有效的减少AI工作负载碳足迹的策略。

Abstract: 'Follow-the-Sun' (FtS) is a theoretical computational model aimed at
minimizing the carbon footprint of computer workloads. It involves dynamically
moving workloads to regions with cleaner energy sources as demand increases and
energy production relies more on fossil fuels. With the significant power
consumption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) being a subject of extensive
debate, FtS is proposed as a strategy to mitigate the carbon footprint of
training AI models. However, the literature lacks scientific evidence on the
advantages of FtS to mitigate the carbon footprint of AI workloads. In this
paper, we present the results of an experiment conducted in a partial synthetic
scenario to address this research gap. We benchmarked four AI algorithms in the
anomaly detection domain and measured the differences in carbon emissions in
four cases: no strategy, FtS, and two strategies previously introduced in the
state of the art, namely Flexible Start and Pause and Resume. To conduct our
experiment, we utilized historical carbon intensity data from the year 2021 for
seven European cities. Our results demonstrate that the FtS strategy not only
achieves average reductions of up to 14.6% in carbon emissions (with peaks of
16.3%) but also helps in preserving the time needed for training.

analyze the power of LLMs to understand some common visualizations by answering
simple questions. Our study shows that LLMs could generate code for some

several limitations. We believe that our insights can be used to improve both

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于函数式编程和类型系统的框架，将Scala后端代码转换为形式化的Lean表示，并利用LLM验证生成的定理，自动化验证50%的测试需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动化测试方法存在局限性（如测试局部性、可靠性不足、业务逻辑盲区），无法匹配人类工程师的能力。

Method: 通过将Scala代码转换为Lean形式化表示，自动生成定理描述API和数据库操作的预期行为，并用LLM验证这些定理。

Result: 在真实后端系统中验证了50%的测试需求，LLM验证成本仅为每API 2.19美元，显著优于人工测试。

Conclusion: 该框架为可扩展的AI驱动软件测试提供了有前景的方向，有望大幅提升工程效率。

Abstract: Software testing plays a critical role in ensuring that systems behave as
intended. However, existing automated testing approaches struggle to match the
capabilities of human engineers due to key limitations such as test locality,
lack of general reliability, and business logic blindness. In this work, we
propose a novel framework that leverages functional programming and type
systems to translate Scala backend code into formal Lean representations. Our
pipeline automatically generates theorems that specify the intended behavior of
APIs and database operations, and uses LLM-based provers to verify them. When a
theorem is proved, the corresponding logic is guaranteed to be correct and no
further testing is needed. If the negation of a theorem is proved instead, it
confirms a bug. In cases where neither can be proved, human intervention is
required. We evaluate our method on realistic backend systems and find that it
can formally verify over 50% of the test requirements, which suggests that half
of a testing engineer's workload can be automated. Additionally, with an
average cost of only $2.19 per API, LLM-based verification is significantly
more cost-effective than manual testing and can be scaled easily through
parallel execution. Our results indicate a promising direction for scalable,
AI-powered software testing, with the potential to greatly improve engineering
productivity as models continue to advance.

Method: 开发了基于符号执行的测试生成工具，自动为COBOL程序生成单元测试并模拟外部资源调用，生成等效的JUnit测试用例进行验证。

Result: 通过运行生成的测试用例，验证了原始COBOL程序与翻译后Java代码的语义等价性，并提供修复反馈。

Conclusion: 该框架有效验证了代码转换的正确性，并为AI模型提供了改进反馈。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM) based Generative AI techniques
have made it feasible to translate enterpriselevel code from legacy languages
such as COBOL to modern languages such as Java or Python. While the results of
LLM-based automatic transformation are encouraging, the resulting code cannot
be trusted to correctly translate the original code. We propose a framework and
a tool to help validate the equivalence of COBOL and translated Java. The
results can also help repair the code if there are some issues and provide
feedback to the AI model to improve. We have developed a
symbolic-execution-based test generation to automatically generate unit tests
for the source COBOL programs which also mocks the external resource calls. We
generate equivalent JUnit test cases with equivalent mocking as COBOL and run
them to check semantic equivalence between original and translated programs.

Motivation: 当前的技术就绪评估未能充分捕捉AI特有的关键因素，可能导致部署风险，因此需要一种专门针对AI的评估框架。

Method: 提出了一种类似于传统技术就绪水平（TRL）但针对AI扩展的框架，结合现有数据评估工具和测试实践。

Result: 该框架为军事决策者提供了更清晰的洞察，确保AI系统在性能、透明度和人机整合方面达到部署标准。

Conclusion: 这一结构化方法推动了国防技术管理和风险评估领域的发展，增强了AI系统在军事应用中的可信度。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is poised to revolutionize military combat
systems, but ensuring these AI-enabled capabilities are truly mission-ready
presents new challenges. We argue that current technology readiness assessments
fail to capture critical AI-specific factors, leading to potential risks in
deployment. We propose a new AI Readiness Framework to evaluate the maturity
and trustworthiness of AI components in military systems. The central thesis is
that a tailored framework - analogous to traditional Technology Readiness
Levels (TRL) but expanded for AI - can better gauge an AI system's reliability,
safety, and suitability for combat use. Using current data evaluation tools and
testing practices, we demonstrate the framework's feasibility for near-term
implementation. This structured approach provides military decision-makers with
clearer insight into whether an AI-enabled system has met the necessary
standards of performance, transparency, and human integration to be deployed
with confidence, thus advancing the field of defense technology management and
risk assessment.

Motivation: 现有基准测试未充分评估LLMs在嵌入式系统开发中的能力，需填补这一空白。

Result: LLMs表现差异大，如DeepSeek-R1在生成原理图时仅50%通过率。提出的策略显著提升性能。

Conclusion: 通过EmbedAgent和Embedbench，揭示了LLMs在嵌入式领域的局限性，并提出改进策略。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in various tasks, yet few
benchmarks assess their capabilities in embedded system development.In this
paper, we introduce EmbedAgent, a paradigm designed to simulate real-world
roles in embedded system development, such as Embedded System Programmer,
Architect, and Integrator. This paradigm enables LLMs to be tested in tasks
that bridge the gap between digital and physical systems, allowing for a more
comprehensive assessment of their capabilities. To evaluate LLMs on these
tasks, we propose Embedbench, the first comprehensive benchmark for embedded
system programming, circuit design, and cross-platform migration.Embedbench
consists of 126 cases, covering 9 electronic components across 3 hardware
platforms. Through extensive experiments on 10 mainstream LLMs, we uncover
several key findings. Surprisingly, despite the simplicity of the cases,
DeepSeek-R1 achieves only a 55.6% pass@1 rate when provided with schematic
information, and 50.0% when tasked with generating the schematics itself. In
the cross-platform migration tasks, LLMs show relatively strong performance
with MicroPython on the Raspberry Pi Pico (with the top model achieving 73.8%
pass@1), but perform poorly on ESP-IDF, where the best model reaches only 29.4%
pass@1.Interestingly, we observe that general-purpose chat LLMs like
DeepSeek-V3 often fail to utilize relevant pre-trained knowledge in this
domain, while reasoning LLMs tend to overthink and overlook efficient knowledge
during pretraining. Based on these insights, we propose two strategies:
retrieval augmented generation and compiler feedback-to enhance LLM
performance. These strategies result in significant improvements, with
Deepseek-R1 reaching a 65.1% pass@1 with correct schematics, and 53.1% without.
Additionally, the accuracy of the Arduino to ESP32 migration task improves from
21.4% to 27.8%.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly integrated into software
engineering and maintenance tasks due to their high performance with software
engineering tasks and robust understanding of modern programming languages.
However, the ability of LLMs to comprehend code written with legacy languages
remains a research gap challenged by real-world legacy systems lacking or
containing inaccurate documentation that may impact LLM comprehension. To
assess LLM comprehension of legacy languages, there is a need for objective LLM
evaluation. In order to objectively measure LLM comprehension of legacy
languages, we need an efficient, quantitative evaluation method. We leverage
multiple-choice question answering (MCQA), an emerging LLM evaluation
methodology, to evaluate LLM comprehension of legacy code and the impact of
comment prevalence and inaccurate comments. In this work, we present
preliminary findings on the impact of documentation on LLM comprehension of
legacy code and outline strategic objectives for future work.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为功能聚类的黑盒方法，通过采样和测试候选程序，显著减少代码生成LLM的幻觉错误，并提供可调置信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代代码生成LLM仍会产生细微错误，导致输出不可靠，无法自主部署。

Method: 采样多个候选程序，在自生成测试套件上执行，聚类I/O行为相同的程序，最大聚类的质量作为置信度估计。

Result: 在LiveCodeBench上，错误率从65%降至2%，保守阈值下可降至0%，同时保留15.6%的覆盖率。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于闭源API和未来模型，为自主代码生成提供了可靠路径。

Abstract: Modern code-generation LLMs can already solve a large fraction of programming
problems, yet they still hallucinate subtle bugs that make their outputs unsafe
for autonomous deployment. We present functional clustering, a black-box
wrapper that eliminates nearly all hallucination-induced errors while providing
a tunable confidence score. The wrapper samples many candidate programs,
executes each on a self-generated test suite, and clusters candidates whose I/O
behavior is identical; the empirical mass of the largest cluster serves as an
exact confidence estimate. A single scalar threshold on this estimate lets
users trade coverage for reliability with exponential guarantees. On
LiveCodeBench our verifier preserves baseline pass@1 on solvable tasks yet
slashes the error rate of returned answers from ~65% to 2%, and drives it to 0%
at a conservative threshold while still answering 15.6% of prompts. Manual
audits show that the few residual mistakes stem from prompt misinterpretation,
not random generation noise, narrowing future work to specification clarity.
Because the method requires only sampling and sandbox execution, it applies
unchanged to closed-source APIs and future models, offering a practical path
toward dependable, autonomous code generation. Our code is available on Github
(https://github.com/20ChaituR/functional-clustering).

Method: 通过控制实验，分析400个代码样本在40轮改进中的安全漏洞变化，采用四种不同的提示策略。

Result: 仅五轮迭代后，关键漏洞增加37.6%，不同提示策略下漏洞模式各异。

Conclusion: 迭代LLM改进可能引入新安全问题，需结合人工验证，并提出实用指南以降低风险。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of Large Language Models(LLMs) for code generation has
transformed software development, yet little attention has been given to how
security vulnerabilities evolve through iterative LLM feedback. This paper
analyzes security degradation in AI-generated code through a controlled
experiment with 400 code samples across 40 rounds of "improvements" using four
distinct prompting strategies. Our findings show a 37.6% increase in critical
vulnerabilities after just five iterations, with distinct vulnerability
patterns emerging across different prompting approaches. This evidence
challenges the assumption that iterative LLM refinement improves code security
and highlights the essential role of human expertise in the loop. We propose
practical guidelines for developers to mitigate these risks, emphasizing the
need for robust human validation between LLM iterations to prevent the
paradoxical introduction of new security issues during supposedly beneficial
code "improvements".

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着代码代理在解决独立编程问题上的准确性提高，如何将其能力用于重构代码以支持可重用性和可维护性成为重要问题。

Method: 提出了Librarian方法，一种基于采样和重新排序的生成可重用库的方法，以及Minicode基准，用于评估代码代理在重构和压缩代码方面的能力。

Result: Librarian在Minicode基准上表现出色，压缩率比现有代码代理高1.6-2倍，同时提高了正确性。

Conclusion: Librarian方法和Minicode基准为代码代理在重构和可重用性方面的研究提供了有效工具，代码和基准已开源。

Abstract: Maintainable and general software allows developers to build robust
applications efficiently, yet achieving these qualities often requires
refactoring specialized solutions into reusable components. This challenge
becomes particularly relevant as code agents become increasingly accurate at
solving isolated programming problems. We investigate code agents' capacity to
refactor code in ways supporting growth and reusability. We present both a
method and a benchmark for refactoring: Librarian, a sample-and-rerank method
for generating reusable libraries, and Minicode, a benchmark where code agents
must minimize and refactor multiple independent solutions into a joint library.
Compared to state-of-the-art code agents, Librarian achieves strong results on
both compression and correctness on Minicode, obtaining compression rates
1.6-2x better than coding agents while also improving correctness. We
open-source our code and benchmark at https://code-refactor.github.io/.

Conclusion: 全局上下文收集和多方面推理对大型代码库至关重要，Code Researcher展示了其有效性和通用性。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based coding agents have shown promising results
on coding benchmarks, but their effectiveness on systems code remains
underexplored. Due to the size and complexities of systems code, making changes
to a systems codebase is a daunting task, even for humans. It requires
researching about many pieces of context, derived from the large codebase and
its massive commit history, before making changes. Inspired by the recent
progress on deep research agents, we design the first deep research agent for
code, called Code Researcher, and apply it to the problem of generating patches
for mitigating crashes reported in systems code. Code Researcher performs
multi-step reasoning about semantics, patterns, and commit history of code to
gather sufficient context. The context is stored in a structured memory which
is used for synthesizing a patch. We evaluate Code Researcher on kBenchSyz, a
benchmark of Linux kernel crashes, and show that it significantly outperforms
strong baselines, achieving a crash-resolution rate of 58%, compared to 37.5%
by SWE-agent. On an average, Code Researcher explores 10 files in each
trajectory whereas SWE-agent explores only 1.33 files, highlighting Code
Researcher's ability to deeply explore the codebase. Through another experiment
on an open-source multimedia software, we show the generalizability of Code
Researcher. Our experiments highlight the importance of global context

*Jiahui Geng,Fengyu Cai,Shaobo Cui,Qing Li,Liangwei Chen,Chenyang Lyu,Haonan Li,Derui Zhu,Walter Pretschner,Heinz Koeppl,Fakhri Karray*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: CoQuIR是一个多语言、大规模的质量感知代码检索基准，评估了23个检索模型在代码质量四个维度上的表现，并提出了改进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码检索基准主要关注功能相关性，忽视了代码质量的重要性。

Method: 引入CoQuIR基准，包含42,725个查询和134,907个代码片段的质量标注，并提出两种质量中心评估指标。

Result: 发现即使是顶级模型也难区分低质量代码，通过合成数据集训练，质量感知指标有所提升。

Conclusion: 强调了将质量信号整合到代码检索系统中的重要性，为更可靠的软件开发工具奠定了基础。

Abstract: Code retrieval is essential in modern software development, as it boosts code
reuse and accelerates debugging. However, current benchmarks primarily
emphasize functional relevance while neglecting critical dimensions of software
quality. Motivated by this gap, we introduce CoQuIR, the first large-scale,
multilingual benchmark specifically designed to evaluate quality-aware code
retrieval across four key dimensions: correctness, efficiency, security, and
maintainability. CoQuIR provides fine-grained quality annotations for 42,725
queries and 134,907 code snippets in 11 programming languages, and is
accompanied by two quality-centric evaluation metrics: Pairwise Preference
Accuracy and Margin-based Ranking Score. Using CoQuIR, we benchmark 23
retrieval models, covering both open-source and proprietary systems, and find
that even top-performing models frequently fail to distinguish buggy or
insecure code from their more robust counterparts. Furthermore, we conduct
preliminary investigations into training methods that explicitly encourage
retrievers to recognize code quality. Using synthetic datasets, we demonstrate
promising improvements in quality-aware metrics across various models, without
sacrificing semantic relevance. Downstream code generation experiments further
validate the effectiveness of our approach. Overall, our work highlights the
importance of integrating quality signals into code retrieval systems, laying
the groundwork for more trustworthy and robust software development tools.

Conclusion: LeanExplore有望提升Lean 4工作流程和AI驱动的数学研究。

Abstract: The expanding Lean 4 ecosystem poses challenges for navigating its vast
libraries. This paper introduces LeanExplore, a search engine for Lean 4
declarations. LeanExplore enables users to semantically search for statements,
both formally and informally, across select Lean 4 packages (including
Batteries, Init, Lean, Mathlib, PhysLean, and Std). This search capability is
powered by a hybrid ranking strategy, integrating scores from a multi-source
semantic embedding model (capturing conceptual meaning from formal Lean code,
docstrings, AI-generated informal translations, and declaration titles), BM25+
for keyword-based lexical relevance, and a PageRank-based score reflecting
declaration importance and interconnectedness. The search engine is accessible
via a dedicated website (https://www.leanexplore.com/) and a Python API
(https://github.com/justincasher/lean-explore). Furthermore, the database can
be downloaded, allowing users to self-host the service. LeanExplore integrates
easily with LLMs via the model context protocol (MCP), enabling users to chat
with an AI assistant about Lean declarations or utilize the search engine for
building theorem-proving agents. This work details LeanExplore's architecture,
data processing, functionalities, and its potential to enhance Lean 4 workflows

*Weibo Gao,Qi Liu,Rui Li,Yuze Zhao,Hao Wang,Linan Yre,Fangzhou Yao,Zheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Coda是一个基于代码图的调谐适配器，用于增强现有编程知识跟踪（PKT）模型，通过识别和减轻噪声信号的影响，提升个性化编程教育的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前PKT研究主要关注代码内容与知识评估的隐式关系，但忽略了长期编程活动中的噪声信号（如无关提交和微小修改），这限制了模型性能和应用。

Method: Coda将松散代码序列转换为紧凑代码图，利用语义相似性识别无关信号，并通过聚类感知GCN增强弱信号的区分和聚类。最后，通过优化噪声特征约束和导航正则化项，校正受噪声影响的知识状态。

Result: 在四个真实数据集上的实验表明，Coda在存在噪声编程记录的情况下有效执行PKT任务，优于典型基线方法。

Conclusion: Coda是一种模型无关的框架，可适配大多数现有PKT解决方案，显著提升噪声环境下的知识跟踪性能。

Abstract: Programming Knowledge Tracking (PKT) aims to dynamically diagnose learners'
mastery levels of programming knowledge based on their coding activities,
facilitating more effective and personalized programming education. However,
current PKT studies primarily focus on the implicit relationship between code
content and knowledge assessment, often overlooking two types of noise signals
in long-term programming activities: unwanted signals from unrelated
submissions and weak signals from minor modifications. This practical challenge
significantly limits model performance and application. To address this issue,
we propose Coda, a Code graph-based tuning adaptor designed to enhance existing
PKT models by identifying and mitigating the impact of noise. Specifically,
Coda first transforms the loose code sequences submitted by each learner into a
compact code graph. By leveraging this code graph, unwanted signals can be
identified from a semantic similarity perspective. We then apply a
cluster-aware GCN to the code graph, which improves the discrimination of weak
signals and enables their clustering for identification. Finally, a lightweight
yet effective adaptor is incorporated into the PKT task through optimization
with two noise feature-based constraints and a navigational regularization
term, to correct knowledge states affected by noise. It is worth mentioning
that the Coda framework is model-agnostic and can be adapted to most existing
PKT solutions. Extensive experimental results on four real-world datasets
demonstrate that Coda effectively performs the PKT task in the presence of
noisy programming records, outperforming typical baselines.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: CodeMirage是一个全面的基准测试，用于评估AI生成代码的检测器，覆盖10种编程语言和10种先进LLM，揭示了当前检测器的优缺点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM生成的代码存在滥用风险（如抄袭、许可证违规、不安全代码），需要可靠的检测方法，但现有基准测试不足。

Method: CodeMirage通过覆盖多语言、多模型（包括推理和非推理模型）和多样化代码样本（原始和改写），构建了一个更全面的基准。

Result: 评估了10种检测器，发现了9个关键发现，揭示了当前方法的优缺点和未来挑战。

Conclusion: CodeMirage为开发更鲁棒、通用的AI代码检测器提供了实用测试平台。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become integral to modern software
development, producing vast amounts of AI-generated source code. While these
models boost programming productivity, their misuse introduces critical risks,
including code plagiarism, license violations, and the propagation of insecure
programs. As a result, robust detection of AI-generated code is essential. To
support the development of such detectors, a comprehensive benchmark that
reflects real-world conditions is crucial. However, existing benchmarks fall
short -- most cover only a limited set of programming languages and rely on
less capable generative models. In this paper, we present CodeMirage, a
comprehensive benchmark that addresses these limitations through three major
advancements: (1) it spans ten widely used programming languages, (2) includes
both original and paraphrased code samples, and (3) incorporates outputs from
ten state-of-the-art production-level LLMs, including both reasoning and
non-reasoning models from six major providers. Using CodeMirage, we evaluate
ten representative detectors across four methodological paradigms under four
realistic evaluation configurations, reporting results using three
complementary metrics. Our analysis reveals nine key findings that uncover the
strengths and weaknesses of current detectors, and identify critical challenges
for future work. We believe CodeMirage offers a rigorous and practical testbed
to advance the development of robust and generalizable AI-generated code
detectors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代软件工程中漏洞检测的自动化需求增加，但现有深度学习方法需大量标注数据和频繁训练，资源消耗大。

Method: 提出YOTO框架，通过参数融合整合多类型漏洞检测模型，避免联合训练。

Result: YOTO能快速适应新漏洞，显著减少模型更新的时间和计算成本。

Conclusion: YOTO为漏洞检测提供了一种高效、资源友好的解决方案。

Abstract: With the pervasive integration of computer applications across industries,
the presence of vulnerabilities within code bases poses significant risks. The
diversity of software ecosystems coupled with the intricate nature of modern
software engineering has led to a shift from manual code vulnerability
identification towards the adoption of automated tools. Among these, deep
learning-based approaches have risen to prominence due to their superior
accuracy; however, these methodologies encounter several obstacles. Primarily,
they necessitate extensive labeled datasets and prolonged training periods, and
given the rapid emergence of new vulnerabilities, the frequent retraining of
models becomes a resource-intensive endeavor, thereby limiting their
applicability in cutting-edge scenarios. To mitigate these challenges, this
paper introduces the \underline{\textbf{YOTO}}--\underline{\textbf{Y}}ou
\underline{\textbf{O}}nly \underline{\textbf{T}}rain \underline{\textbf{O}}nce
framework. This innovative approach facilitates the integration of multiple
types of vulnerability detection models via parameter fusion, eliminating the
need for joint training. Consequently, YOTO enables swift adaptation to newly
discovered vulnerabilities, significantly reducing both the time and
computational resources required for model updates.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于LLM的自动评估方法（LLM-as-a-Judge），用于验证和改进Bash代码生成，以提高IT自动化中事件修复的代码质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法（如表面相似性指标）和执行评估存在局限性，需要更高效、准确的自动验证方法。

Method: 采用双向功能匹配和逻辑表示增强LLM-as-a-Judge，并结合执行评估作为基准验证。

Result: LLM-as-a-Judge方法在准确性上优于基线（最高8%），并通过反馈代理实现代码精度的显著提升（最高24%）。

Conclusion: LLM-as-a-Judge方法在自动代码验证和优化中表现出高效性和潜力。

Abstract: In an effort to automatically evaluate and select the best model and improve
code quality for automatic incident remediation in IT Automation, it is crucial
to verify if the generated code for remediation action is syntactically and
semantically correct and whether it can be executed correctly as intended.
There are three approaches: 1) conventional methods use surface form similarity
metrics (token match, exact match, etc.) which have numerous limitations, 2)
execution-based evaluation focuses more on code functionality based on
pass/fail judgments for given test-cases, and 3) LLM-as-a-Judge employs LLMs
for automated evaluation to judge if it is a correct answer for a given problem
based on pre-defined metrics. In this work, we focused on enhancing
LLM-as-a-Judge using bidirectional functionality matching and logic
representation for reference-less automatic validation and refinement for Bash
code generation to select the best model for automatic incident remediation in
IT Automation. We used execution-based evaluation as ground-truth to evaluate
our LLM-as-a-Judge metrics. Results show high accuracy and agreement with
execution-based evaluation (and up to 8% over baseline). Finally, we built
Reflection code agents to utilize judgments and feedback from our evaluation
metrics which achieved significant improvement (up to 24% increase in accuracy)
for automatic code refinement.

<details>

Motivation: 传统基于本体或资产管理壳的能力和技能建模需要大量手动工作，且难以被LLM直接利用。

Method: 使用MCP标准化接口暴露系统功能，并在实验室规模的制造系统中进行原型评估，由通用LLM规划和执行多步骤流程。

Result: 实验表明，该方法无需依赖显式语义模型即可实现灵活的工业自动化。

Conclusion: 为LLM驱动的生产系统中外部工具集成提供了进一步探索的基础。

Abstract: Explicit modeling of capabilities and skills -- whether based on ontologies,
Asset Administration Shells, or other technologies -- requires considerable
manual effort and often results in representations that are not easily
accessible to Large Language Models (LLMs). In this work-in-progress paper, we
present an alternative approach based on the recently introduced Model Context
Protocol (MCP). MCP allows systems to expose functionality through a
standardized interface that is directly consumable by LLM-based agents. We
conduct a prototypical evaluation on a laboratory-scale manufacturing system,
where resource functions are made available via MCP. A general-purpose LLM is
then tasked with planning and executing a multi-step process, including
constraint handling and the invocation of resource functions via MCP. The
results indicate that such an approach can enable flexible industrial
automation without relying on explicit semantic models. This work lays the
basis for further exploration of external tool integration in LLM-driven
production systems.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种将NL2SQL数据集转换为NL2API数据集的方法，并评估了10个公共LLM在API调用任务中的表现，发现其完成率较低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业部署的LLM需要处理复杂API集合，但缺乏相关数据集，因此研究如何利用现有NL2SQL数据集生成NL2API数据集。

Method: 开发了一种数据生成管道，利用SQL查询语法构建功能等效的API调用序列，并将其应用于BIRD-SQL数据集。

Result: 生成的API集合包含2500多个API，但LLM在任务完成率上表现不佳（7-47%），使用ReACT代理后略有提升至50%。

Conclusion: 当前LLM在工具调用任务中表现有限，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are routinely deployed as agentic systems, with
access to tools that interact with live environments to accomplish tasks. In
enterprise deployments these systems need to interact with API collections that
can be extremely large and complex, often backed by databases. In order to
create datasets with such characteristics, we explore how existing NL2SQL
(Natural Language to SQL query) datasets can be used to automatically create
NL2API datasets. Specifically, this work describes a novel data generation
pipeline that exploits the syntax of SQL queries to construct a functionally
equivalent sequence of API calls. We apply this pipeline to one of the largest
NL2SQL datasets, BIRD-SQL to create a collection of over 2500 APIs that can be
served as invocable tools or REST-endpoints. We pair natural language queries
from BIRD-SQL to ground-truth API sequences based on this API pool. We use this
collection to study the performance of 10 public LLMs and find that all models
struggle to determine the right set of tools (consisting of tasks of intent
detection, sequencing with nested function calls, and slot-filling). We find
that models have extremely low task completion rates (7-47 percent - depending
on the dataset) which marginally improves to 50 percent when models are
employed as ReACT agents that interact with the live API environment. The best
task completion rates are far below what may be required for effective
general-use tool-calling agents, suggesting substantial scope for improvement
in current state-of-the-art tool-calling LLMs. We also conduct detailed
ablation studies, such as assessing the impact of the number of tools available
as well as the impact of tool and slot-name obfuscation. We compare the
performance of models on the original SQL generation tasks and find that
current models are sometimes able to exploit SQL better than APIs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GPU高性能计算的普及推动了并行编程的需求，但数据稀缺和功能等价问题限制了机器学习方法的有效性。

Method: MuSL框架包含翻译器和测试器，通过协同验证和协同进化步骤相互生成数据并共同改进。

Result: 实验表明，MuSL显著提升了基础模型的性能，在多个指标上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MuSL框架有效解决了功能等价问题，为序列到并行代码翻译提供了新思路。

Abstract: The rise of GPU-based high-performance computing (HPC) has driven the
widespread adoption of parallel programming models such as CUDA. Yet, the
inherent complexity of parallel programming creates a demand for the automated
sequential-to-parallel approaches. However, data scarcity poses a significant
challenge for machine learning-based sequential-to-parallel code translation.
Although recent back-translation methods show promise, they still fail to
ensure functional equivalence in the translated code. In this paper, we propose
a novel Mutual-Supervised Learning (MSL) framework for sequential-to-parallel
code translation to address the functional equivalence issue. MSL consists of
two models, a Translator and a Tester. Through an iterative loop consisting of
Co-verify and Co-evolve steps, the Translator and the Tester mutually generate
data for each other and improve collectively. The Tester generates unit tests
to verify and filter functionally equivalent translated code, thereby evolving
the Translator, while the Translator generates translated code as augmented
input to evolve the Tester. Experimental results demonstrate that MuSL
significantly enhances the performance of the base model: when applied to
Qwen2.5-Coder, it not only improves Pass@1 by up to 28.91% and boosts Tester
performance by 68.90%, but also outperforms the previous state-of-the-art
method CodeRosetta by 1.56 and 6.92 in BLEU and CodeBLEU scores, while
achieving performance comparable to DeepSeek-R1 and GPT-4.1. Our code is

Result: 前沿模型在中等难度问题上的通过率为53%，困难问题为0%，且依赖工具增强而非推理能力。

Conclusion: LiveCodeBench Pro揭示了LLMs与人类专家的差距，为未来代码推理改进提供了细粒度诊断。

Abstract: Recent reports claim that large language models (LLMs) now outperform elite
humans in competitive programming. Drawing on knowledge from a group of
medalists in international algorithmic contests, we revisit this claim,
examining how LLMs differ from human experts and where limitations still
remain. We introduce LiveCodeBench Pro, a benchmark composed of problems from
Codeforces, ICPC, and IOI that are continuously updated to reduce the
likelihood of data contamination. A team of Olympiad medalists annotates every
problem for algorithmic categories and conducts a line-by-line analysis of
failed model-generated submissions. Using this new data and benchmark, we find
that frontier models still have significant limitations: without external
tools, the best model achieves only 53% pass@1 on medium-difficulty problems
and 0% on hard problems, domains where expert humans still excel. We also find
that LLMs succeed at implementation-heavy problems but struggle with nuanced
algorithmic reasoning and complex case analysis, often generating confidently
incorrect justifications. High performance appears largely driven by
implementation precision and tool augmentation, not superior reasoning.
LiveCodeBench Pro thus highlights the significant gap to human grandmaster
levels, while offering fine-grained diagnostics to steer future improvements in
code-centric LLM reasoning.

Motivation: 现有方法缺乏真实环境的验证信号和显式优化，导致自我验证不可靠。

Result: 在LiveCodeBench上Pass@k显著提升，推理时代码随轮次增加持续优化，超越DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B。

Conclusion: ReVeal是构建更强大、自主AI代理的可扩展有效范式。

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable outcome
rewards have significantly improved the reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs), especially when combined with multi-turn tool
interactions. However, existing methods lack both meaningful verification
signals from realistic environments and explicit optimization for verification,
leading to unreliable self-verification. To address these limitations, we
propose ReVeal, a multi-turn reinforcement learning framework that interleaves
code generation with explicit self-verification and tool-based evaluation.
ReVeal enables LLMs to autonomously generate test cases, invoke external tools
for precise feedback, and improves performance via a customized RL algorithm
with dense, per-turn rewards. As a result, ReVeal fosters the co-evolution of a
model's generation and verification capabilities through RL training, expanding
the reasoning boundaries of the base model, demonstrated by significant gains
in Pass@k on LiveCodeBench. It also enables test-time scaling into deeper
inference regimes, with code consistently evolving as the number of turns
increases during inference, ultimately surpassing DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B.
These findings highlight the promise of ReVeal as a scalable and effective
paradigm for building more robust and autonomous AI agents.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文探讨了GPT-4在自动生成单元测试方面的能力，特别是针对漏洞修复的测试生成，结果表明GPT-4能生成语法正确的测试用例，但语义正确性验证有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在软件开发中，测试是质量保证的关键环节，但手动创建测试复杂且耗时。研究旨在利用GPT-4自动生成单元测试，以减轻开发者和安全专家的负担。

Method: 研究使用VUL4J数据集中的真实漏洞及其修复代码，评估GPT-4生成测试用例的能力，重点关注代码上下文、自我纠正能力和测试用例的实用性。

Result: GPT-4能生成66.5%语法正确的测试用例，但语义正确性仅能自动验证7.5%。主观评估显示生成的测试模板可进一步开发为功能完整的测试。

Conclusion: 尽管数据有限，GPT-4在生成漏洞见证测试中表现良好，可作为部分自动化流程的重要工具。

Abstract: In the life-cycle of software development, testing plays a crucial role in
quality assurance. Proper testing not only increases code coverage and prevents
regressions but it can also ensure that any potential vulnerabilities in the
software are identified and effectively fixed. However, creating such tests is
a complex, resource-consuming manual process. To help developers and security
experts, this paper explores the automatic unit test generation capability of
one of the most widely used large language models, GPT-4, from the perspective
of vulnerabilities. We examine a subset of the VUL4J dataset containing real
vulnerabilities and their corresponding fixes to determine whether GPT-4 can
generate syntactically and/or semantically correct unit tests based on the code
before and after the fixes as evidence of vulnerability mitigation. We focus on
the impact of code contexts, the effectiveness of GPT-4's self-correction
ability, and the subjective usability of the generated test cases. Our results
indicate that GPT-4 can generate syntactically correct test cases 66.5\% of the
time without domain-specific pre-training. Although the semantic correctness of
the fixes could be automatically validated in only 7. 5\% of the cases, our
subjective evaluation shows that GPT-4 generally produces test templates that
can be further developed into fully functional vulnerability-witnessing tests
with relatively minimal manual effort.
  Therefore, despite the limited data, our initial findings suggest that GPT-4
can be effectively used in the generation of vulnerability-witnessing tests. It
may not operate entirely autonomously, but it certainly plays a significant
role in a partially automated process.

Motivation: 研究GPT-4o在自动化漏洞修复（AVR）中的性能，探索不同上下文信息对其能力的影响。

Method: 比较GPT-4o与GPT-4在相同提示下的表现，设计9种包含不同上下文信息的提示，并在42个漏洞上测试。

Result: GPT-4o修复了62%的漏洞，优于基线（40%）和复现结果（45%）；CVE信息显著提升修复率。

Conclusion: 集成多种提示策略可提升零样本设置下的漏洞修复效果。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for
automated vulnerability detection and repair in software systems. This paper
investigates the performance of GPT-4o in repairing Java vulnerabilities from a
widely used dataset (Vul4J), exploring how different contextual information
affects automated vulnerability repair (AVR) capabilities. We compare the
latest GPT-4o's performance against previous results with GPT-4 using identical
prompts. We evaluated nine additional prompts crafted by us that contain
various contextual information such as CWE or CVE information, and manually
extracted code contexts. Each prompt was executed three times on 42
vulnerabilities, and the resulting fix candidates were validated using Vul4J's
automated testing framework.
  Our results show that GPT-4o performed 11.9\% worse on average than GPT-4
with the same prompt, but was able to fix 10.5\% more distinct vulnerabilities
in the three runs together. CVE information significantly improved repair
rates, while the length of the task description had minimal impact. Combining
CVE guidance with manually extracted code context resulted in the best
performance. Using our \textsc{Top}-3 prompts together, GPT-4o repaired 26
(62\%) vulnerabilities at least once, outperforming both the original baseline
(40\%) and its reproduction (45\%), suggesting that ensemble prompt strategies
could improve vulnerability repair in zero-shot settings.

Motivation: SNN能大幅降低AI系统的能耗，但主流加速器（如GPU和TPU）不适合SNN模拟，FPGA因其高内存带宽和大容量片上内存更适合。

Method: 开发了FeNN处理器，采用随机舍入和饱和技术，实现高数值精度和低硬件利用率。

Result: FeNN在SNN分类器模拟中表现优于嵌入式GPU和Loihi系统。

Conclusion: FeNN是一种高效且可编程的SNN模拟解决方案，适用于从边缘到云的标准计算机应用。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have the potential to drastically reduce the
energy requirements of AI systems. However, mainstream accelerators like GPUs
and TPUs are designed for the high arithmetic intensity of standard ANNs so are
not well-suited to SNN simulation. FPGAs are well-suited to applications with
low arithmetic intensity as they have high off-chip memory bandwidth and large
amounts of on-chip memory. Here, we present a novel RISC-V-based soft vector
processor (FeNN), tailored to simulating SNNs on FPGAs. Unlike most dedicated
neuromorphic hardware, FeNN is fully programmable and designed to be integrated
with applications running on standard computers from the edge to the cloud. We
demonstrate that, by using stochastic rounding and saturation, FeNN can achieve
high numerical precision with low hardware utilisation and that a single FeNN
core can simulate an SNN classifier faster than both an embedded GPU and the
Loihi neuromorphic system.

### [410] [Brain2Vec: A Deep Learning Framework for EEG-Based Stress Detection Using CNN-LSTM-Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11179)
*Md Mynoddin,Troyee Dev,Rishita Chakma*

TL;DR: Brain2Vec是一种新型深度学习工具，通过结合卷积、循环和注意力机制，从原始EEG信号中分类压力状态，表现优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心理健康压力日益普遍，需要开发非侵入性诊断工具。EEG信号虽能直接反映神经活动，但其非平稳性和高维度特性带来建模挑战。

Method: 采用混合架构（卷积层、LSTM层和注意力机制）处理EEG信号，结合预处理流程（带通滤波、z-score归一化和分段）。

Result: 在DEAP数据集上，Brain2Vec的AUC得分为0.68，验证准确率为81.25%，优于传统CNN-LSTM基线。

Conclusion: Brain2Vec在可穿戴压力监测平台和个性化医疗系统中具有应用潜力。

Abstract: Mental stress has become a pervasive factor affecting cognitive health and
overall well-being, necessitating the development of robust, non-invasive
diagnostic tools. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals provide a direct window
into neural activity, yet their non-stationary and high-dimensional nature
poses significant modeling challenges. Here we introduce Brain2Vec, a new deep
learning tool that classifies stress states from raw EEG recordings using a
hybrid architecture of convolutional, recurrent, and attention mechanisms. The
model begins with a series of convolutional layers to capture localized spatial
dependencies, followed by an LSTM layer to model sequential temporal patterns,
and concludes with an attention mechanism to emphasize informative temporal
regions. We evaluate Brain2Vec on the DEAP dataset, applying bandpass
filtering, z-score normalization, and epoch segmentation as part of a
comprehensive preprocessing pipeline. Compared to traditional CNN-LSTM
baselines, our proposed model achieves an AUC score of 0.68 and a validation
accuracy of 81.25%. These findings demonstrate Brain2Vec's potential for
integration into wearable stress monitoring platforms and personalized
healthcare systems.

Motivation: 现实世界的动态系统常偏离卡尔曼滤波器的线性高斯假设，需要数据驱动的滤波技术。

Method: 使用递归约瑟夫公式传播误差协方差，并优化高斯负对数似然。

Result: 在非高斯测量白噪声实验中，模型表现优于传统卡尔曼滤波器和现有深度学习估计器。

Conclusion: Recursive KalmanNet在非理想条件下提供了更准确的状态估计和误差协方差量化。

Abstract: State estimation in stochastic dynamical systems with noisy measurements is a
challenge. While the Kalman filter is optimal for linear systems with
independent Gaussian white noise, real-world conditions often deviate from
these assumptions, prompting the rise of data-driven filtering techniques. This
paper introduces Recursive KalmanNet, a Kalman-filter-informed recurrent neural
network designed for accurate state estimation with consistent error covariance
quantification. Our approach propagates error covariance using the recursive
Joseph's formula and optimizes the Gaussian negative log-likelihood.
Experiments with non-Gaussian measurement white noise demonstrate that our
model outperforms both the conventional Kalman filter and an existing
state-of-the-art deep learning based estimator.

Motivation: ECG信号常受噪声干扰，影响临床和可穿戴设备的诊断准确性，传统方法存在标注不一致和泛化性差的问题。

Method: 采用基于扩散的框架，通过Wasserstein-1距离（$W_1$）比较干净和噪声ECG的重建误差分布，仅需三步反向扩散实现噪声量化。

Result: 模型在基准测试中取得1.308的$W_1$宏平均分，优于次优方法48%以上，外部验证显示强泛化性。

Conclusion: 该方法提升了临床决策、诊断准确性和实时ECG监测能力，支持未来临床和可穿戴ECG应用的发展。

Abstract: Electrocardiography (ECG) signals are often degraded by noise, which
complicates diagnosis in clinical and wearable settings. This study proposes a
diffusion-based framework for ECG noise quantification via reconstruction-based
anomaly detection, addressing annotation inconsistencies and the limited
generalizability of conventional methods. We introduce a distributional
evaluation using the Wasserstein-1 distance ($W_1$), comparing the
reconstruction error distributions between clean and noisy ECGs to mitigate
inconsistent annotations. Our final model achieved robust noise quantification
using only three reverse diffusion steps. The model recorded a macro-average
$W_1$ score of 1.308 across the benchmarks, outperforming the next-best method
by over 48%. External validations demonstrated strong generalizability,
supporting the exclusion of low-quality segments to enhance diagnostic accuracy
and enable timely clinical responses to signal degradation. The proposed method
enhances clinical decision-making, diagnostic accuracy, and real-time ECG
monitoring capabilities, supporting future advancements in clinical and
wearable ECG applications.

Motivation: 探索球迷情绪表达与球队表现之间的关系，为体育分析、社交媒体动态和球迷参与研究提供新视角。

Method: 对83支球队的Instagram评论进行情感分析，提取时间模式，并基于复杂系统理论分析情绪分布。

Result: 愤怒情绪呈现爆发性分布，快乐情绪则相反；情绪爆发性与球队表现显著相关，排除该参数后模型解释力下降32%。

Conclusion: 球迷情绪动态与球队表现密切相关，情绪爆发性可作为预测指标，为相关领域研究提供新方向。

Abstract: This study investigates the emotional dynamics of Italian soccer fandoms
through computational analysis of user-generated content from official
Instagram accounts of 83 teams across Serie A, Serie B, and Lega Pro during the
2023-24 season. By applying sentiment analysis to fan comments, we extract
temporal emotional patterns and identify distinct clusters of fan bases with
similar preseason expectations. Drawing from complex systems theory, we
characterize joy as displaying anti-bursty temporal distributions, while anger
is marked by pronounced bursty patterns. Our analysis reveals significant
correlations between these emotional signals, preseason expectations,
socioeconomic factors, and final league rankings. In particular, the burstiness
metric emerges as a meaningful correlate of team performance; statistical
models excluding this parameter show a decrease in the coefficient of
determination of 32%. These findings offer novel insights into the relationship
between fan emotional expression and team outcomes, suggesting potential
avenues for research in sports analytics, social media dynamics, and fan
engagement studies.

Motivation: 统一现代Hopfield网络与注意力机制，增强Transformer模型对复杂关系的理解和表示能力。

Method: 提出一种能量泛函，其极小值形成“上下文井”，梯度对应注意力计算，引入非线性注意力机制。

Result: 非线性注意力机制能提升模型在序列建模任务中的表现和效率。

Conclusion: 该方法为Transformer模型引入非线性头提供了理论基础，适用于BERT等模型。

Abstract: In this work we propose an energy functional along the lines of Modern
Hopfield Networks (MNH), the stationary points of which correspond to the
attention due to Vaswani et al. [12], thus unifying both frameworks. The minima
of this landscape form "context wells" - stable configurations that encapsulate
the contextual relationships among tokens. A compelling picture emerges: across
$n$ token embeddings an energy landscape is defined whose gradient corresponds
to the attention computation. Non-linear attention mechanisms offer a means to
enhance the capabilities of transformer models for various sequence modeling
tasks by improving the model's understanding of complex relationships, learning
of representations, and overall efficiency and performance. A rough analogy can
be seen via cubic splines which offer a richer representation of non-linear
data where a simpler linear model may be inadequate. This approach can be used
for the introduction of non-linear heads in transformer based models such as
BERT, [6], etc.

speaking, we investigate when datasets from different sources can be
effectively merged to enhance the predictive model's performance, and propose a
practical algorithm with theoretical guarantees. By leveraging an oracle
inequality and data-driven estimators, the algorithm reduces population loss
with high probability. Numerical experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in
both standard linear regression and broader machine learning applications. Code

Result: 数值实验显示新算法在保持查询效率的同时，速度提升高达16倍。

Conclusion: 新算法显著降低计算开销，适用于需要高效优化的功能网络问题。

Abstract: Bayesian optimization of function networks (BOFN) is a framework for
optimizing expensive-to-evaluate objective functions structured as networks,
where some nodes' outputs serve as inputs for others. Many real-world
applications, such as manufacturing and drug discovery, involve function
networks with additional properties - nodes that can be evaluated independently
and incur varying costs. A recent BOFN variant, p-KGFN, leverages this
structure and enables cost-aware partial evaluations, selectively querying only
a subset of nodes at each iteration. p-KGFN reduces the number of expensive
objective function evaluations needed but has a large computational overhead:
choosing where to evaluate requires optimizing a nested Monte Carlo-based
acquisition function for each node in the network. To address this, we propose
an accelerated p-KGFN algorithm that reduces computational overhead with only a
modest loss in query efficiency. Key to our approach is generation of
node-specific candidate inputs for each node in the network via one inexpensive
global Monte Carlo simulation. Numerical experiments show that our method
maintains competitive query efficiency while achieving up to a 16x speedup over
the original p-KGFN algorithm.

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效降低计算成本，同时保持贝叶斯反问题的准确性。

Abstract: Solving inverse problems in cardiovascular modeling is particularly
challenging due to the high computational cost of running high-fidelity
simulations. In this work, we focus on Bayesian parameter estimation and
explore different methods to reduce the computational cost of sampling from the
posterior distribution by leveraging low-fidelity approximations. A common
approach is to construct a surrogate model for the high-fidelity simulation
itself. Another is to build a surrogate for the discrepancy between high- and
low-fidelity models. This discrepancy, which is often easier to approximate, is
modeled with either a fully connected neural network or a nonlinear
dimensionality reduction technique that enables surrogate construction in a
lower-dimensional space. A third possible approach is to treat the discrepancy
between the high-fidelity and surrogate models as random noise and estimate its
distribution using normalizing flows. This allows us to incorporate the
approximation error into the Bayesian inverse problem by modifying the
likelihood function. We validate five different methods which are variations of
the above on analytical test cases by comparing them to posterior distributions
derived solely from high-fidelity models, assessing both accuracy and
computational cost. Finally, we demonstrate our approaches on two
cardiovascular examples of increasing complexity: a lumped-parameter Windkessel
model and a patient-specific three-dimensional anatomy.

Motivation: 解决动态系统多自由度时空预测的挑战，提升算子学习的表达能力。

Method: 通过增强分支网络的表达能力和扩展主干网络的预测能力，构建FExD模型。

Result: FExD在精度和计算效率上优于传统DeepONet和扩展DeepONet。

Conclusion: FExD在结构动力学应用中代表了算子学习的重大进展。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal data, which consists of responses or measurements gathered at
different times and positions, is ubiquitous across diverse applications of
civil infrastructure. While SciML methods have made significant progress in
tackling the issue of response prediction for individual time histories,
creating a full spatial-temporal surrogate remains a challenge. This study
proposes a novel variant of deep operator networks (DeepONets), namely the
full-field Extended DeepONet (FExD), to serve as a spatial-temporal surrogate
that provides multi-output response predictions for dynamical systems. The
proposed FExD surrogate model effectively learns the full solution operator
across multiple degrees of freedom by enhancing the expressiveness of the
branch network and expanding the predictive capabilities of the trunk network.
The proposed FExD surrogate is deployed to simultaneously capture the dynamics
at several sensing locations along a testbed model of a cable-stayed bridge
subjected to stochastic ground motions. The ensuing response predictions from
the FExD are comprehensively compared against both a vanilla DeepONet and a
modified spatio-temporal Extended DeepONet. The results demonstrate the
proposed FExD can achieve both superior accuracy and computational efficiency,
representing a significant advancement in operator learning for structural
dynamics applications.

Method: 定义了获取函数解的不精确度量，并分析了GP-UCB和GP-TS在非精确解下的累积遗憾界限。

Result: 在适当条件下，非精确贝叶斯优化算法仍能实现次线性累积遗憾。

Conclusion: 随机网格搜索是一种计算高效且有效的获取函数求解方法，得到了理论和数值验证。

Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a widely used iterative algorithm for
optimizing black-box functions. Each iteration requires maximizing an
acquisition function, such as the upper confidence bound (UCB) or a sample path
from the Gaussian process (GP) posterior, as in Thompson sampling (TS).
However, finding an exact solution to these maximization problems is often
intractable and computationally expensive. Reflecting such realistic
situations, in this paper, we delve into the effect of inexact maximizers of
the acquisition functions. Defining a measure of inaccuracy in acquisition
solutions, we establish cumulative regret bounds for both GP-UCB and GP-TS
without requiring exact solutions of acquisition function maximization. Our
results show that under appropriate conditions on accumulated inaccuracy,
inexact BO algorithms can still achieve sublinear cumulative regret. Motivated
by such findings, we provide both theoretical justification and numerical
validation for random grid search as an effective and computationally efficient
acquisition function solver.

Result: 在正则单纯形配置下，EM算法能以指数速度收敛，并通过数值实验验证。

Conclusion: 研究深化了对EM算法的理解，为实际应用提供了初始化策略和模型设计的指导。

Abstract: We investigate the convergence properties of the EM algorithm when applied to
overspecified Gaussian mixture models -- that is, when the number of components
in the fitted model exceeds that of the true underlying distribution. Focusing
on a structured configuration where the component means are positioned at the
vertices of a regular simplex and the mixture weights satisfy a non-degeneracy
condition, we demonstrate that the population EM algorithm converges
exponentially fast in terms of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) distance. Our analysis
leverages the strong convexity of the negative log-likelihood function in a
neighborhood around the optimum and utilizes the Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz
inequality to establish that an $\epsilon$-accurate approximation is achievable
in $O(\log(1/\epsilon))$ iterations. Furthermore, we extend these results to a
finite-sample setting by deriving explicit statistical convergence guarantees.
Numerical experiments on synthetic datasets corroborate our theoretical
findings, highlighting the dramatic acceleration in convergence compared to
conventional sublinear rates. This work not only deepens the understanding of
EM's behavior in overspecified settings but also offers practical insights into
initialization strategies and model design for high-dimensional clustering and
density estimation tasks.

Conclusion: PGMs在某些实际场景中可能比GNNs更适合，尤其是在特征质量较差或图异质性较高时。

Abstract: Graphs are a powerful data structure for representing relational data and are
widely used to describe complex real-world systems. Probabilistic Graphical
Models (PGMs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can both leverage
graph-structured data, but their inherent functioning is different. The
question is how do they compare in capturing the information contained in
networked datasets? We address this objective by solving a link prediction task
and we conduct three main experiments, on both synthetic and real networks: one
focuses on how PGMs and GNNs handle input features, while the other two
investigate their robustness to noisy features and increasing heterophily of
the graph. PGMs do not necessarily require features on nodes, while GNNs cannot
exploit the network edges alone, and the choice of input features matters. We
find that GNNs are outperformed by PGMs when input features are low-dimensional
or noisy, mimicking many real scenarios where node attributes might be scalar
or noisy. Then, we find that PGMs are more robust than GNNs when the
heterophily of the graph is increased. Finally, to assess performance beyond
prediction tasks, we also compare the two frameworks in terms of their
computational complexity and interpretability.

Result: 通过合成和实际数据集验证了方法的有效性，能够匹配已知的极限分布和全谱。

Conclusion: 该方法为处理“不可触及”矩阵的谱估计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Computing eigenvalues of very large matrices is a critical task in many
machine learning applications, including the evaluation of log-determinants,
the trace of matrix functions, and other important metrics. As datasets
continue to grow in scale, the corresponding covariance and kernel matrices
become increasingly large, often reaching magnitudes that make their direct
formation impractical or impossible. Existing techniques typically rely on
matrix-vector products, which can provide efficient approximations, if the
matrix spectrum behaves well. However, in settings like distributed learning,
or when the matrix is defined only indirectly, access to the full data set can
be restricted to only very small sub-matrices of the original matrix. In these
cases, the matrix of nominal interest is not even available as an implicit
operator, meaning that even matrix-vector products may not be available. In
such settings, the matrix is "impalpable," in the sense that we have access to
only masked snapshots of it. We draw on principles from free probability theory
to introduce a novel method of "free decompression" to estimate the spectrum of
such matrices. Our method can be used to extrapolate from the empirical
spectral densities of small submatrices to infer the eigenspectrum of extremely
large (impalpable) matrices (that we cannot form or even evaluate with full
matrix-vector products). We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach
through a series of examples, comparing its performance against known limiting
distributions from random matrix theory in synthetic settings, as well as
applying it to submatrices of real-world datasets, matching them with their
full empirical eigenspectra.

Motivation: 现有方法在同时应用推测解码和张量并行时存在计算不平衡、KV缓存不一致和通信开销等问题，无法实现高效的低延迟解码。

Method: SwiftSpec重新设计了推测解码流程，采用异步和分散式架构，引入并行树生成、树感知KV缓存管理和优化的内核。

Result: 在5个模型家族和6个数据集上，SwiftSpec平均提速1.75倍，Llama3-70B在8个Nvidia Hopper GPU上达到348 tokens/s。

Conclusion: SwiftSpec是目前已知最快的低延迟LLM服务系统，解决了现有技术的瓶颈。

Abstract: Low-latency decoding for large language models (LLMs) is crucial for
applications like chatbots and code assistants, yet generating long outputs
remains slow in single-query settings. Prior work on speculative decoding
(which combines a small draft model with a larger target model) and tensor
parallelism has each accelerated decoding. However, conventional approaches
fail to apply both simultaneously due to imbalanced compute requirements
(between draft and target models), KV-cache inconsistencies, and communication
overheads under small-batch tensor-parallelism. This paper introduces
SwiftSpec, a system that targets ultra-low latency for LLM decoding. SwiftSpec
redesigns the speculative decoding pipeline in an asynchronous and
disaggregated manner, so that each component can be scaled flexibly and remove
draft overhead from the critical path. To realize this design, SwiftSpec
proposes parallel tree generation, tree-aware KV cache management, and fused,
latency-optimized kernels to overcome the challenges listed above. Across 5
model families and 6 datasets, SwiftSpec achieves an average of 1.75x speedup
over state-of-the-art speculative decoding systems and, as a highlight, serves
Llama3-70B at 348 tokens/s on 8 Nvidia Hopper GPUs, making it the fastest known
system for low-latency LLM serving at this scale.

Abstract: Crystalline materials can form different structural arrangements (i.e.
polymorphs) with the same chemical composition, exhibiting distinct physical
properties depending on how they were synthesized or the conditions under which
they operate. For example, carbon can exist as graphite (soft, conductive) or
diamond (hard, insulating). Computational methods that can predict these
polymorphs are vital in materials science, which help understand stability
relationships, guide synthesis efforts, and discover new materials with desired
properties without extensive trial-and-error experimentation. However,
effective crystal structure prediction (CSP) algorithms for inorganic polymorph
structures remain limited. We propose ParetoCSP2, a multi-objective genetic
algorithm for polymorphism CSP that incorporates an adaptive space group
diversity control technique, preventing over-representation of any single space
group in the population guided by a neural network interatomic potential. Using
an improved population initialization method and performing iterative structure
relaxation, ParetoCSP2 not only alleviates premature convergence but also
achieves improved convergence speed. Our results show that ParetoCSP2 achieves
excellent performance in polymorphism prediction, including a nearly perfect
space group and structural similarity accuracy for formulas with two polymorphs
but with the same number of unit cell atoms. Evaluated on a benchmark dataset,
it outperforms baseline algorithms by factors of 2.46-8.62 for these accuracies
and improves by 44.8\%-87.04\% across key performance metrics for regular CSP.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了现有网络基础设施是否应升级或重建以适应AI代理的需求，分析了三种方案并建议混合架构。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI代理的自主行为对现有网络基础设施提出了新挑战，如快速发现、凭证撤销和行为证明等。

Method: 分析了DNS传播、证书撤销和IP寻址的不足，评估了升级、重建和混合三种方案。

Result: 发现AI代理的需求是质变而非量变，混合架构（集中注册与联邦网络）更具可行性。

Conclusion: 建议采用混合架构，结合集中注册和联邦网络的优点，以平衡性能和部署速度。

Abstract: The emerging Internet of AI Agents challenges existing web infrastructure
designed for human-scale, reactive interactions. Unlike traditional web
resources, autonomous AI agents initiate actions, maintain persistent state,
spawn sub-agents, and negotiate directly with peers: demanding
millisecond-level discovery, instant credential revocation, and cryptographic
behavioral proofs that exceed current DNS/PKI capabilities. This paper analyzes
whether to upgrade existing infrastructure or implement purpose-built registry
architectures for autonomous agents. We identify critical failure points: DNS
propagation (24-48 hours vs. required milliseconds), certificate revocation
unable to scale to trillions of entities, and IPv4/IPv6 addressing inadequate
for agent-scale routing. We evaluate three approaches: (1) Upgrade paths, (2)
Switch options, (3) Hybrid registries. Drawing parallels to dialup-to-broadband
transitions, we find that agent requirements constitute qualitative, and not
incremental, changes. While upgrades offer compatibility and faster deployment,
clean-slate solutions provide better performance but require longer for
adoption. Our analysis suggests hybrid approaches will emerge, with centralized
registries for critical agents and federated meshes for specialized use cases.

Abstract: The emergence of Agile Earth Observation Satellites (AEOSs) has marked a
significant turning point in the field of Earth Observation (EO), offering
enhanced flexibility in data acquisition. Concurrently, advancements in onboard
satellite computing and communication technologies have greatly enhanced data
compression efficiency, reducing network latency and congestion while
supporting near real-time information delivery. In this paper, we address the
Agile Earth Observation Satellite Scheduling Problem (AEOSSP), which involves
determining the optimal sequence of target observations to maximize overall
observation profit. Our approach integrates onboard data processing for
real-time remote monitoring into the multi-satellite optimization problem. To
this end, we define a set of priority indicators and develop a constructive
heuristic method, further enhanced with a Local Search (LS) strategy. The
results show that the proposed algorithm provides high-quality information by
increasing the resolution of the collected frames by up to 10% on average,
while reducing the variance in the monitoring frequency of the targets within
the instance by up to 83%, ensuring more up-to-date information across the
entire set compared to a First-In First-Out (FIFO) method.

Result: 模型在ISCX VPN-nonVPN数据集上达到96.59%的准确率，参数和计算量大幅减少，同时在其他分类任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法为IoT网络安全提供了可扩展且高效的解决方案，适用于实时加密流量分析。

Abstract: This paper presents a hardware-efficient deep neural network (DNN), optimized
through hardware-aware neural architecture search (HW-NAS); the DNN supports
the classification of session-level encrypted traffic on resource-constrained
Internet of Things (IoT) and edge devices. Thanks to HW-NAS, a 1D convolutional
neural network (CNN) is tailored on the ISCX VPN-nonVPN dataset to meet strict
memory and computational limits while achieving robust performance. The
optimized model attains an accuracy of 96.59% with just 88.26K parameters,
10.08M FLOPs, and a maximum tensor size of 20.12K. Compared to state-of-the-art
models, it achieves reductions of up to 444-fold, 312-fold, and 15.6-fold in
these metrics, respectively, significantly minimizing memory footprint and
runtime requirements. The model also demonstrates versatility in classification
tasks, achieving accuracies of up to 99.64% in VPN differentiation, VPN-type
classification, broader traffic categories, and application identification. In
addition, an in-depth approach to header-level preprocessing strategies
confirms that the optimized model can provide notable performances across a
wide range of configurations, even in scenarios with stricter privacy
considerations. Likewise, a reduction in the length of sessions of up to 75%
yields significant improvements in efficiency, while maintaining high accuracy
with only a negligible drop of 1-2%. However, the importance of careful
preprocessing and session length selection in the classification of raw traffic
data is still present, as improper settings or aggressive reductions can bring
about a 7% reduction in overall accuracy. Those results highlight the method's
effectiveness in enforcing cybersecurity for IoT networks, by providing
scalable, efficient solutions for the real-time analysis of encrypted traffic
within strict hardware limitations.

Conclusion: RecFound通过创新的多任务训练方案，显著提升了推荐基础模型的性能。

Abstract: Developing a single foundation model with the capability to excel across
diverse tasks has been a long-standing objective in the field of artificial
intelligence. As the wave of general-purpose foundation models sweeps across
various domains, their influence has significantly extended to the field of
recommendation systems. While recent efforts have explored recommendation
foundation models for various generative tasks, they often overlook crucial
embedding tasks and struggle with the complexities of multi-task learning,
including knowledge sharing & conflict resolution, and convergence speed
inconsistencies. To address these limitations, we introduce RecFound, a
generative representational learning framework for recommendation foundation
models. We construct the first comprehensive dataset for recommendation
foundation models covering both generative and embedding tasks across diverse
scenarios. Based on this dataset, we propose a novel multi-task training scheme
featuring a Task-wise Mixture of Low-rank Experts (TMoLE) to handle knowledge
sharing & conflict, a Step-wise Convergence-oriented Sample Scheduler (S2Sched)
to address inconsistent convergence, and a Model Merge module to balance the
performance across tasks. Experiments demonstrate that RecFound achieves
state-of-the-art performance across various recommendation tasks, outperforming
existing baselines.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of Internet services, recommendation systems play a
central role in delivering personalized content. Faced with massive user
requests and complex model architectures, the key challenge for real-time
recommendation systems is how to reduce inference latency and increase system
throughput without sacrificing recommendation quality. This paper addresses the
high computational cost and resource bottlenecks of deep learning models in
real-time settings by proposing a combined set of modeling- and system-level
acceleration and optimization strategies. At the model level, we dramatically
reduce parameter counts and compute requirements through lightweight network
design, structured pruning, and weight quantization. At the system level, we
integrate multiple heterogeneous compute platforms and high-performance
inference libraries, and we design elastic inference scheduling and
load-balancing mechanisms based on real-time load characteristics. Experiments
show that, while maintaining the original recommendation accuracy, our methods
cut latency to less than 30% of the baseline and more than double system
throughput, offering a practical solution for deploying large-scale online
recommendation services.

TL;DR: GraphRAG-Causal结合图检索与大型语言模型，提升新闻分析中的因果推理能力，显著优于传统NLP方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统NLP方法在低数据场景下难以识别复杂隐式因果关系，GraphRAG-Causal旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用三阶段流程：数据准备（标注新闻并构建因果图）、图检索（混合语义与结构检索）、LLM推理（少样本学习）。

Result: 实验显示，仅用20个少样本即达到82.1%的F1分数，显著提升准确性和一致性。

Conclusion: 该框架适用于新闻可靠性评估、虚假信息检测和政策分析等实时应用。

Abstract: GraphRAG-Causal introduces an innovative framework that combines graph-based
retrieval with large language models to enhance causal reasoning in news
analysis. Traditional NLP approaches often struggle with identifying complex,
implicit causal links, especially in low-data scenarios. Our approach addresses
these challenges by transforming annotated news headlines into structured
causal knowledge graphs. It then employs a hybrid retrieval system that merges
semantic embeddings with graph-based structural cues leveraging Neo4j to
accurately match and retrieve relevant events. The framework is built on a
three-stage pipeline: First, during Data Preparation, news sentences are
meticulously annotated and converted into causal graphs capturing cause,
effect, and trigger relationships. Next, the Graph Retrieval stage stores these
graphs along with their embeddings in a Neo4j database and utilizes hybrid
Cypher queries to efficiently identify events that share both semantic and
structural similarities with a given query. Finally, the LLM Inference stage
utilizes these retrieved causal graphs in a few-shot learning setup with
XML-based prompting, enabling robust classification and tagging of causal
relationships. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that GraphRAG-Causal
achieves an impressive F1-score of 82.1% on causal classification using just 20
few-shot examples. This approach significantly boosts accuracy and consistency,
making it highly suitable for real-time applications in news reliability
assessment, misinformation detection, and policy analysis.

Conclusion: 该架构可扩展且适应性强，推动了在检测系统中直接集成学习，为实时信息处理开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Advances in sensor technology and automation have ushered in an era of data
abundance, where the ability to identify and extract relevant information in
real time has become increasingly critical. Traditional filtering approaches,
which depend on a priori knowledge, often struggle to adapt to dynamic or
unanticipated data features. Machine learning offers a compelling
alternative-particularly when training can occur directly at or near the
detector. This paper presents a digital hardware architecture designed for
real-time neural network training, specifically optimized for high-throughput
data ingestion. The design is described in an implementation-independent
manner, with detailed analysis of each architectural component and their
performance implications. Through system parameterization, the study explores
trade-offs between processing speed, model complexity, and hardware resource
utilization. Practical examples illustrate how these parameters affect
applicability across various use cases. A proof-of-concept implementation on an
FPGA demonstrates in-situ training, confirming that computational accuracy is
preserved relative to conventional software-based approaches. Moreover,
resource estimates indicate that current-generation FPGAs can train networks of
approximately 3,500 neurons per chip. The architecture is both scalable and
adaptable, representing a significant advancement toward integrating learning
directly within detector systems and enabling a new class of extreme-edge,
real-time information processing.

Motivation: 尽管MLLMs在音频-视觉任务中表现出色，但其依赖第三方数据和开源模型带来了安全风险，现有研究缺乏对各种攻击类型的统一综述。

Method: 通过系统综述音频-视觉攻击（如对抗攻击、后门攻击和越狱攻击），并分析最新MLLMs中的攻击类型。

Result: 揭示了MLLMs在音频-视觉任务中的安全漏洞，并总结了现有攻击方法的局限性。

Conclusion: 本文为未来音频-视觉攻击与防御研究提供了全面的见解，并指出了新兴趋势和挑战。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs), which bridge the gap between
audio-visual and natural language processing, achieve state-of-the-art
performance on several audio-visual tasks. Despite the superior performance of
MLLMs, the scarcity of high-quality audio-visual training data and
computational resources necessitates the utilization of third-party data and
open-source MLLMs, a trend that is increasingly observed in contemporary
research. This prosperity masks significant security risks. Empirical studies
demonstrate that the latest MLLMs can be manipulated to produce malicious or
harmful content. This manipulation is facilitated exclusively through
instructions or inputs, including adversarial perturbations and malevolent
queries, effectively bypassing the internal security mechanisms embedded within
the models. To gain a deeper comprehension of the inherent security
vulnerabilities associated with audio-visual-based multimodal models, a series
of surveys investigates various types of attacks, including adversarial and
backdoor attacks. While existing surveys on audio-visual attacks provide a
comprehensive overview, they are limited to specific types of attacks, which
lack a unified review of various types of attacks. To address this issue and
gain insights into the latest trends in the field, this paper presents a
comprehensive and systematic review of audio-visual attacks, which include
adversarial attacks, backdoor attacks, and jailbreak attacks. Furthermore, this
paper also reviews various types of attacks in the latest audio-visual-based
MLLMs, a dimension notably absent in existing surveys. Drawing upon
comprehensive insights from a substantial review, this paper delineates both
challenges and emergent trends for future research on audio-visual attacks and
defense.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着扩散模型生成图像的真实性提升，版权和滥用问题日益突出，现有单域水印方法鲁棒性不足。

Method: 采用双域水印嵌入方法（空间和频率域），引入模型无关的可学习高斯噪声恢复器（GNR）以增强对图像操作和高级攻击的鲁棒性。

Result: 在多种图像失真和高级攻击下，GaussMarker在三个Stable Diffusion版本中实现了最优性能，召回率更高且误报率更低。

Conclusion: GaussMarker为扩散模型水印提供了高效且鲁棒的解决方案，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: As Diffusion Models (DM) generate increasingly realistic images, related
issues such as copyright and misuse have become a growing concern. Watermarking
is one of the promising solutions. Existing methods inject the watermark into
the single-domain of initial Gaussian noise for generation, which suffers from
unsatisfactory robustness. This paper presents the first dual-domain DM
watermarking approach using a pipelined injector to consistently embed
watermarks in both the spatial and frequency domains. To further boost
robustness against certain image manipulations and advanced attacks, we
introduce a model-independent learnable Gaussian Noise Restorer (GNR) to refine
Gaussian noise extracted from manipulated images and enhance detection
robustness by integrating the detection scores of both watermarks. GaussMarker
efficiently achieves state-of-the-art performance under eight image distortions
and four advanced attacks across three versions of Stable Diffusion with better
recall and lower false positive rates, as preferred in real applications.

Result: 在GPU上实现2.8秒的端到端推理时间，通信量仅420 MiB，性能显著提升。

Conclusion: SecONNds高效且适合资源受限环境，为隐私敏感应用提供实用解决方案。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of outsourced neural network inference presents
significant privacy challenges, as sensitive user data is processed on
untrusted remote servers. Secure inference offers a privacy-preserving
solution, but existing frameworks suffer from high computational overhead and
communication costs, rendering them impractical for real-world deployment. We
introduce SecONNds, a non-intrusive secure inference framework optimized for
large ImageNet-scale Convolutional Neural Networks. SecONNds integrates a novel
fully Boolean Goldreich-Micali-Wigderson (GMW) protocol for secure comparison
-- addressing Yao's millionaires' problem -- using preprocessed Beaver's bit
triples generated from Silent Random Oblivious Transfer. Our novel protocol
achieves an online speedup of 17$\times$ in nonlinear operations compared to
state-of-the-art solutions while reducing communication overhead. To further
enhance performance, SecONNds employs Number Theoretic Transform (NTT)
preprocessing and leverages GPU acceleration for homomorphic encryption
operations, resulting in speedups of 1.6$\times$ on CPU and 2.2$\times$ on GPU
for linear operations. We also present SecONNds-P, a bit-exact variant that
ensures verifiable full-precision results in secure computation, matching the
results of plaintext computations. Evaluated on a 37-bit quantized SqueezeNet
model, SecONNds achieves an end-to-end inference time of 2.8 s on GPU and 3.6 s
on CPU, with a total communication of just 420 MiB. SecONNds' efficiency and
reduced computational load make it well-suited for deploying privacy-sensitive
applications in resource-constrained environments. SecONNds is open source and

Motivation: 电子商务行业的持续增长导致信用卡欺诈增加，分析师因处理大量警报而疲劳，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: FAA框架利用LLM的推理、代码执行和视觉能力，分七步完成欺诈调查的规划、证据收集和分析。

Result: 对500起信用卡欺诈调查的实证评估显示，FAA框架能可靠且高效地完成调查。

Conclusion: FAA框架能自动化大部分工作，有效减轻欺诈分析师的压力。

Abstract: The continuous growth of the e-commerce industry attracts fraudsters who
exploit stolen credit card details. Companies often investigate suspicious
transactions in order to retain customer trust and address gaps in their fraud
detection systems. However, analysts are overwhelmed with an enormous number of
alerts from credit card transaction monitoring systems. Each alert
investigation requires from the fraud analysts careful attention, specialized
knowledge, and precise documentation of the outcomes, leading to alert fatigue.
To address this, we propose a fraud analyst assistant (FAA) framework, which
employs multi-modal large language models (LLMs) to automate credit card fraud
investigations and generate explanatory reports. The FAA framework leverages
the reasoning, code execution, and vision capabilities of LLMs to conduct
planning, evidence collection, and analysis in each investigation step. A
comprehensive empirical evaluation of 500 credit card fraud investigations
demonstrates that the FAA framework produces reliable and efficient
investigations comprising seven steps on average. Thus we found that the FAA
framework can automate large parts of the workload and help reduce the
challenges faced by fraud analysts.

Abstract: Machine learning models should not reveal particular information that is not
otherwise accessible. Differential privacy provides a formal framework to
mitigate privacy risks by ensuring that the inclusion or exclusion of any
single data point does not significantly alter the output of an algorithm, thus
limiting the exposure of private information. This survey paper explores the
foundational definitions of differential privacy, reviews its original
formulations and tracing its evolution through key research contributions. It
then provides an in-depth examination of how DP has been integrated into
machine learning models, analyzing existing proposals and methods to preserve
privacy when training ML models. Finally, it describes how DP-based ML
techniques can be evaluated in practice. %Finally, it discusses the broader
implications of DP, highlighting its potential for public benefit, its
real-world applications, and the challenges it faces, including vulnerabilities
to adversarial attacks. By offering a comprehensive overview of differential

Abstract: Modern life has witnessed the explosion of mobile devices. However, besides
the valuable features that bring convenience to end users, security and privacy
risks still threaten users of mobile apps. The increasing sophistication of
these threats in recent years has underscored the need for more advanced and
efficient detection approaches. In this chapter, we explore the application of
Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify security risks and privacy violations
and mitigate them for the mobile application ecosystem. By introducing
state-of-the-art research that applied LLMs to mitigate the top 10 common
security risks of smartphone platforms, we highlight the feasibility and
potential of LLMs to replace traditional analysis methods, such as dynamic and
hybrid analysis of mobile apps. As a representative example of LLM-based
solutions, we present an approach to detect sensitive data leakage when users
share images online, a common behavior of smartphone users nowadays. Finally,
we discuss open research challenges.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种方法，通过动态调整训练和测试标签来反映随时间变化的知识，验证了漏洞检测模型的性能趋势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有漏洞数据集在测试时隐含回顾性信息，导致过去与未来性能不一致，传统方法过于乐观或保守。

Method: 将数据集重组为一系列动态变化的训练和测试标签，利用Mann-Kendall检验验证模型是否随时间改进。

Result: 在4个时间数据集和5个模型上验证，发现性能变化不一致，多数模型未真正学习。

Conclusion: 模型性能未随数据增加而稳定提升，表明多数模型未有效学习。

Abstract: Vulnerability datasets used for ML testing implicitly contain retrospective
information. When tested on the field, one can only use the labels available at
the time of training and testing (e.g. seen and assumed negatives). As
vulnerabilities are discovered across calendar time, labels change and past
performance is not necessarily aligned with future performance. Past works only
considered the slices of the whole history (e.g. DiverseVUl) or individual
differences between releases (e.g. Jimenez et al. ESEC/FSE 2019). Such
approaches are either too optimistic in training (e.g. the whole history) or
too conservative (e.g. consecutive releases). We propose a method to
restructure a dataset into a series of datasets in which both training and
testing labels change to account for the knowledge available at the time. If
the model is actually learning, it should improve its performance over time as
more data becomes available and data becomes more stable, an effect that can be
checked with the Mann-Kendall test. We validate our methodology for
vulnerability detection with 4 time-based datasets (3 projects from BigVul
dataset + Vuldeepecker's NVD) and 5 ML models (Code2Vec, CodeBERT, LineVul,
ReGVD, and Vuldeepecker). In contrast to the intuitive expectation (more
retrospective information, better performance), the trend results show that
performance changes inconsistently across the years, showing that most models
are not learning.

Method: 基于新型键依赖哈希函数，保留数据相似性，测试了多种未修改的传统AI算法在HbHAI保护数据集上的表现。

Conclusion: HbHAI是一种有前景的加密技术，能够在不修改AI算法的情况下安全处理加密数据。

Abstract: We present a technical evaluation of a new, disruptive cryptographic approach
to data security, known as HbHAI (Hash-based Homomorphic Artificial
Intelligence). HbHAI is based on a novel class of key-dependent hash functions
that naturally preserve most similarity properties, most AI algorithms rely on.
As a main claim, HbHAI makes now possible to analyze and process data in its
cryptographically secure form while using existing native AI algorithms without
modification, with unprecedented performances compared to existing homomorphic
encryption schemes.
  We tested various HbHAI-protected datasets (non public preview) using
traditional unsupervised and supervised learning techniques (clustering,
classification, deep neural networks) with classical unmodified AI algorithms.
This paper presents technical results from an independent analysis conducted
with those different, off-the-shelf AI algorithms. The aim was to assess the
security, operability and performance claims regarding HbHAI techniques. As a
results, our results confirm most these claims, with only a few minor
reservations.

### [440] [Grids Often Outperform Implicit Neural Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11139)
*Namhoon Kim,Sara Fridovich-Keil*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 研究比较了隐式神经表示（INRs）与网格表示的性能，发现网格在多数任务中表现更优，但INRs在低维结构信号（如形状轮廓）中更具优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究INRs的基本能力、隐式偏差和扩展行为，以指导其未来应用。

Method: 通过2D和3D真实与合成信号（包括断层扫描、超分辨率和去噪任务）评估INRs和网格的性能，并分析模型大小、信号类型和带宽的影响。

Result: 大多数任务中，带插值的正则化网格比相同参数量的INRs训练更快、质量更高；INRs仅在低维结构信号中表现更优。

Conclusion: INRs适用于低维结构信号，而网格在多数任务中更具优势，为INRs的未来应用提供了指导。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have recently shown impressive
results, but their fundamental capacity, implicit biases, and scaling behavior
remain poorly understood. We investigate the performance of diverse INRs across
a suite of 2D and 3D real and synthetic signals with varying effective
bandwidth, as well as both overfitting and generalization tasks including
tomography, super-resolution, and denoising. By stratifying performance
according to model size as well as signal type and bandwidth, our results shed
light on how different INR and grid representations allocate their capacity. We
find that, for most tasks and signals, a simple regularized grid with
interpolation trains faster and to higher quality than any INR with the same
number of parameters. We also find limited settings where INRs outperform grids
-- namely fitting signals with underlying lower-dimensional structure such as
shape contours -- to guide future use of INRs towards the most advantageous
applications. Code and synthetic signals used in our analysis are available at
https://github.com/voilalab/INR-benchmark.

*Wenlong Hou,Gangqian Yang,Ye Du,Yeung Lau,Lihao Liu,Junjun He,Ling Long,Shujun Wang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: ADAgent是一个基于大型语言模型（LLM）的AI代理，用于阿尔茨海默病（AD）的多模态诊断和预后任务，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早期和精确诊断AD对干预和治疗至关重要，但现有方法多依赖单模态数据，无法处理多模态或缺失输入。

Method: ADAgent整合了推理引擎、专业医疗工具和协作结果协调器，支持多模态输入和任务。

Result: 实验显示ADAgent在多模态诊断和预后任务中表现优异，准确率提升2.7%和0.7%。

Conclusion: ADAgent为AD分析提供了首个专用AI代理，显著提升了多模态任务的性能。

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and irreversible neurodegenerative
disease. Early and precise diagnosis of AD is crucial for timely intervention
and treatment planning to alleviate the progressive neurodegeneration. However,
most existing methods rely on single-modality data, which contrasts with the
multifaceted approach used by medical experts. While some deep learning
approaches process multi-modal data, they are limited to specific tasks with a
small set of input modalities and cannot handle arbitrary combinations. This
highlights the need for a system that can address diverse AD-related tasks,
process multi-modal or missing input, and integrate multiple advanced methods
for improved performance. In this paper, we propose ADAgent, the first
specialized AI agent for AD analysis, built on a large language model (LLM) to
address user queries and support decision-making. ADAgent integrates a
reasoning engine, specialized medical tools, and a collaborative outcome
coordinator to facilitate multi-modal diagnosis and prognosis tasks in AD.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that ADAgent outperforms SOTA methods,
achieving significant improvements in accuracy, including a 2.7% increase in
multi-modal diagnosis, a 0.7% improvement in multi-modal prognosis, and
enhancements in MRI and PET diagnosis tasks.

### [442] [Vector Representations of Vessel Trees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11163)
*James Batten,Michiel Schaap,Matthew Sinclair,Ying Bai,Ben Glocker*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为VeTTA的新型框架，用于学习树状几何数据的向量表示，特别针对3D血管网络。该方法使用两个顺序训练的基于Transformer的自编码器，分别捕捉血管段的几何细节和血管网络的拓扑结构，显著降低了GPU内存需求，并在实验中表现出优异的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D卷积模型在处理树状几何数据时存在GPU内存需求高的问题，且难以精确捕捉拓扑结构。因此，需要一种更高效且精确的方法来建模血管网络。

Method: 采用两个Transformer自编码器：第一阶段（Vessel Autoencoder）学习血管段的几何细节，第二阶段（Vessel Tree Autoencoder）编码血管网络的拓扑结构。通过递归解码确保拓扑结构的有效性。

Result: 在2D合成树数据集和3D冠状动脉数据集上，VeTTA表现出更高的重建保真度、准确的拓扑保持能力以及潜在空间中的真实插值效果。

Conclusion: VeTTA框架为医学影像中的树状结构提供了精确、灵活且拓扑一致的建模方法，具有较高的可扩展性和实用性。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for learning vector representations of
tree-structured geometric data focusing on 3D vascular networks. Our approach
employs two sequentially trained Transformer-based autoencoders. In the first
stage, the Vessel Autoencoder captures continuous geometric details of
individual vessel segments by learning embeddings from sampled points along
each curve. In the second stage, the Vessel Tree Autoencoder encodes the
topology of the vascular network as a single vector representation, leveraging
the segment-level embeddings from the first model. A recursive decoding process
ensures that the reconstructed topology is a valid tree structure. Compared to
3D convolutional models, this proposed approach substantially lowers GPU memory
requirements, facilitating large-scale training. Experimental results on a 2D
synthetic tree dataset and a 3D coronary artery dataset demonstrate superior
reconstruction fidelity, accurate topology preservation, and realistic
interpolations in latent space. Our scalable framework, named VeTTA, offers
precise, flexible, and topologically consistent modeling of anatomical tree
structures in medical imaging.

### [443] [DiffPR: Diffusion-Based Phase Reconstruction via Frequency-Decoupled Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11183)
*Yi Zhang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: DiffPR通过取消高频跳跃连接并分阶段处理低频和高频信息，显著提升了定量相位成像的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习在离轴定量相位成像（QPI）中的过平滑问题，尤其是U-Net对低频内容的偏好和高频细节的缺失。

Method: 提出DiffPR框架：第一阶段使用不对称U-Net取消高频跳跃连接预测低频相位图；第二阶段通过无条件扩散模型恢复高频细节。

Result: 在四个QPI数据集上，DiffPR显著优于U-Net基线，PSNR提升1.1 dB，MAE降低11%，细节更清晰。

Conclusion: 取消高频跳跃连接并利用扩散模型合成细节，是解决传统相位检索网络频谱偏置的有效方法。

Abstract: Oversmoothing remains a persistent problem when applying deep learning to
off-axis quantitative phase imaging (QPI). End-to-end U-Nets favour
low-frequency content and under-represent fine, diagnostic detail. We trace
this issue to spectral bias and show that the bias is reinforced by high-level
skip connections that feed high-frequency features directly into the decoder.
Removing those deepest skips thus supervising the network only at a low
resolution significantly improves generalisation and fidelity. Building on this
insight, we introduce DiffPR, a two-stage frequency-decoupled framework. Stage
1: an asymmetric U-Net with cancelled high-frequency skips predicts a
quarter-scale phase map from the interferogram, capturing reliable
low-frequency structure while avoiding spectral bias. Stage 2: the upsampled
prediction, lightly perturbed with Gaussian noise, is refined by an
unconditional diffusion model that iteratively recovers the missing
high-frequency residuals through reverse denoising. Experiments on four QPI
datasets (B-Cell, WBC, HeLa, 3T3) show that DiffPR outperforms strong U-Net
baselines, boosting PSNR by up to 1.1 dB and reducing MAE by 11 percent, while
delivering markedly sharper membrane ridges and speckle patterns. The results
demonstrate that cancelling high-level skips and delegating detail synthesis to
a diffusion prior is an effective remedy for the spectral bias that limits
conventional phase-retrieval networks.

### [444] [Joint Denoising of Cryo-EM Projection Images using Polar Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11283)
*Joakim Andén,Justus Sagemüller*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Transformer的神经网络架构，用于同时聚类、对齐和去噪冷冻电镜图像，相比单图像DNN，相对均方误差降低了45%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DNN在高噪声环境（如冷冻电镜投影图像）中效果有限，但此类数据集包含大量同一分子的投影图像，信息冗余可用于去噪。

Method: 基于Transformer的神经网络架构，同时实现图像的聚类、对齐和去噪。

Result: 在合成数据上，该架构在信噪比为0.03时，相对均方误差比单图像DNN降低了45%。

Conclusion: 该架构有效利用了冷冻电镜图像的信息冗余，显著提升了去噪性能。

Abstract: Deep neural networks~(DNNs) have proven powerful for denoising, but they are
ultimately of limited use in high-noise settings, such as for cryogenic
electron microscopy~(cryo-EM) projection images. In this setting, however,
datasets contain a large number of projections of the same molecule, each taken
from a different viewing direction. This redundancy of information is useful in
traditional denoising techniques known as class averaging methods, where images
are clustered, aligned, and then averaged to reduce the noise level. We present
a neural network architecture based on transformers that extends these class
averaging methods by simultaneously clustering, aligning, and denoising cryo-EM
images. Results on synthetic data show accurate denoising performance using
this architecture, reducing the relative mean squared error (MSE) single-image
DNNs by $45\%$ at a signal-to-noise (SNR) of $0.03$.

*Nan Mu,Ruiqi Song,Xiaoning Li,Zhihui Xu,Jingfeng Jiang,Chen Zhao*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于频域分析的深度学习模型FAD-Net，用于提高冠状动脉分割和狭窄检测的准确性，实验结果显示其性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冠状动脉疾病（CAD）是全球主要死因之一，精确分割冠状动脉对临床决策至关重要。

Method: FAD-Net结合频域注意力机制和级联扩散策略，利用多级自注意力机制和低频扩散模块优化分割精度。

Result: FAD-Net在分割中达到0.8717的Dice系数，狭窄检测的真阳性率和阳性预测值分别为0.6140和0.6398。

Conclusion: FAD-Net在CAD的准确诊断和治疗规划中具有重要潜力。

Abstract: Background: Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains one of the leading causes
of mortality worldwide. Precise segmentation of coronary arteries from invasive
coronary angiography (ICA) is critical for effective clinical decision-making.
Objective: This study aims to propose a novel deep learning model based on
frequency-domain analysis to enhance the accuracy of coronary artery
segmentation and stenosis detection in ICA, thereby offering robust support for
the stenosis detection and treatment of CAD. Methods: We propose the
Frequency-Domain Attention-Guided Diffusion Network (FAD-Net), which integrates
a frequency-domain-based attention mechanism and a cascading diffusion strategy
to fully exploit frequency-domain information for improved segmentation
accuracy. Specifically, FAD-Net employs a Multi-Level Self-Attention (MLSA)
mechanism in the frequency domain, computing the similarity between queries and
keys across high- and low-frequency components in ICAs. Furthermore, a
Low-Frequency Diffusion Module (LFDM) is incorporated to decompose ICAs into
low- and high-frequency components via multi-level wavelet transformation.
Subsequently, it refines fine-grained arterial branches and edges by
reintegrating high-frequency details via inverse fusion, enabling continuous
enhancement of anatomical precision. Results and Conclusions: Extensive
experiments demonstrate that FAD-Net achieves a mean Dice coefficient of 0.8717
in coronary artery segmentation, outperforming existing state-of-the-art
methods. In addition, it attains a true positive rate of 0.6140 and a positive
predictive value of 0.6398 in stenosis detection, underscoring its clinical
applicability. These findings suggest that FAD-Net holds significant potential
to assist in the accurate diagnosis and treatment planning of CAD.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Stable Diffusion的CT超分辨率框架，结合退化模型和视觉语言模型生成描述，显著提升图像质量并降低辐射剂量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率CT成像对医疗诊断至关重要，但辐射剂量与图像质量之间存在矛盾。现有深度学习方法在复杂退化和有限医疗数据下表现不佳。

Method: 利用退化模型合成低质量图像，结合预训练视觉语言模型生成描述，通过Stable Diffusion进行超分辨率重建。

Result: 实验表明，该方法优于现有方法，能够在降低辐射剂量的同时实现高质量CT成像。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了在医疗影像中应用扩散模型的潜力，代码将公开。

Abstract: High-resolution computed tomography (CT) imaging is essential for medical
diagnosis but requires increased radiation exposure, creating a critical
trade-off between image quality and patient safety. While deep learning methods
have shown promise in CT super-resolution, they face challenges with complex
degradations and limited medical training data. Meanwhile, large-scale
pre-trained diffusion models, particularly Stable Diffusion, have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in synthesizing fine details across various vision
tasks. Motivated by this, we propose a novel framework that adapts Stable
Diffusion for CT blind super-resolution. We employ a practical degradation
model to synthesize realistic low-quality images and leverage a pre-trained
vision-language model to generate corresponding descriptions. Subsequently, we
perform super-resolution using Stable Diffusion with a specialized controlling
strategy, conditioned on both low-resolution inputs and the generated text
descriptions. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing
approaches, demonstrating its potential for achieving high-quality CT imaging
at reduced radiation doses. Our code will be made publicly available.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效的压缩视频超分辨率方法，通过压缩驱动的降维策略减少计算复杂度，提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有压缩视频超分辨率模型存在推理时间长、训练流程复杂等问题，且传统方法难以满足高帧率视频的需求。

Method: 利用高光谱图像与视频数据的相似性，设计压缩驱动的降维策略，优化模块化架构。

Result: 性能与当前最优模型相当或更优，同时显著减少推理时间。

Conclusion: 该方法为视频超分辨率技术提供了高效实用的解决方案。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) compressed video super-resolution (CVSR) models face
persistent challenges, including prolonged inference time, complex training
pipelines, and reliance on auxiliary information. As video frame rates continue
to increase, the diminishing inter-frame differences further expose the
limitations of traditional frame-to-frame information exploitation methods,
which are inadequate for addressing current video super-resolution (VSR)
demands. To overcome these challenges, we propose an efficient and scalable
solution inspired by the structural and statistical similarities between
hyperspectral images (HSI) and video data. Our approach introduces a
compression-driven dimensionality reduction strategy that reduces computational
complexity, accelerates inference, and enhances the extraction of temporal
information across frames. The proposed modular architecture is designed for
seamless integration with existing VSR frameworks, ensuring strong adaptability
and transferability across diverse applications. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method achieves performance on par with, or surpassing,
the current SOTA models, while significantly reducing inference time. By
addressing key bottlenecks in CVSR, our work offers a practical and efficient
pathway for advancing VSR technology. Our code will be publicly available at
https://github.com/handsomewzy/FCA2.

Result: 模型在脑疾病诊断中表现优越。

Conclusion: 该模型为脑网络分析研究提供了有前景的新方法。

Abstract: Functional brain network analysis has become an indispensable tool for brain
disease analysis. It is profoundly impacted by deep learning methods, which can
characterize complex connections between ROIs. However, the research on
foundation models of brain network is limited and constrained to a single
dimension, which restricts their extensive application in neuroscience. In this
study, we propose a fine-tuned brain network model for brain disease diagnosis.
It expands brain region representations across multiple dimensions based on the
original brain network model, thereby enhancing its generalizability. Our model
consists of two key modules: (1)an adapter module that expands brain region
features across different dimensions. (2)a fine-tuned foundation brain network
model, based on self-supervised learning and pre-trained on fMRI data from
thousands of participants. Specifically, its transformer block is able to
effectively extract brain region features and compute the inter-region
associations. Moreover, we derive a compact latent representation of the brain
network for brain disease diagnosis. Our downstream experiments in this study
demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior performance in brain
disease diagnosis, which potentially offers a promising approach in brain
network analysis research.

Motivation: 医学影像生成面临隐私、数据稀缺和公平性问题，深度生成模型提供了一种解决方案，但需要验证形态和临床准确性。

Method: 比较了基于领域特定深度特征的距离损失函数与感知损失和边缘检测损失函数的效果。

Result: 领域特定深度特征未提升生成质量，传统边缘检测滤波器在血管结构清晰度上表现更优。

Conclusion: 传统边缘检测滤波器在医学影像生成中更具优势，领域特定深度特征未带来显著改进。

Abstract: The adoption of neural network models in medical imaging has been constrained
by strict privacy regulations, limited data availability, high acquisition
costs, and demographic biases. Deep generative models offer a promising
solution by generating synthetic data that bypasses privacy concerns and
addresses fairness by producing samples for under-represented groups. However,
unlike natural images, medical imaging requires validation not only for
fidelity (e.g., Fr\'echet Inception Score) but also for morphological and
clinical accuracy. This is particularly true for colour fundus retinal imaging,
which requires precise replication of the retinal vascular network, including
vessel topology, continuity, and thickness. In this study, we in-vestigated
whether a distance-based loss function based on deep activation layers of a
large foundational model trained on large corpus of domain data, colour fundus
imaging, offers advantages over a perceptual loss and edge-detection based loss
functions. Our extensive validation pipeline, based on both domain-free and
domain specific tasks, suggests that domain-specific deep features do not
improve autoen-coder image generation. Conversely, our findings highlight the
effectiveness of con-ventional edge detection filters in improving the
sharpness of vascular structures in synthetic samples.

Abstract: Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are a leading cause of disability worldwide,
requiring advanced diagnostic and therapeutic tools for personalised assessment
and treatment. Effective management of MSDs involves the interaction of
heterogeneous data sources, making the Digital Twin (DT) paradigm a valuable
option. This paper introduces the Musculoskeletal Digital Twin (MS-DT), a novel
framework that integrates multiscale biomechanical data with computational
modelling to create a detailed, patient-specific representation of the
musculoskeletal system. By combining motion capture, ultrasound imaging,
electromyography, and medical imaging, the MS-DT enables the analysis of spinal
kinematics, posture, and muscle function. An interactive visualisation platform
provides clinicians and researchers with an intuitive interface for exploring
biomechanical parameters and tracking patient-specific changes. Results
demonstrate the effectiveness of MS-DT in extracting precise kinematic and
dynamic tissue features, offering a comprehensive tool for monitoring spine
biomechanics and rehabilitation. This framework provides high-fidelity
modelling and real-time visualization to improve patient-specific diagnosis and
intervention planning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于结构相似性启发的展开方法（SSIU），用于高效图像超分辨率，结合数据驱动和模型驱动的优势，性能优于现有方法且模型更紧凑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据驱动的超分辨率方法通常通过增加网络深度或使用注意力机制来扩大感受野，但会导致模型复杂度增加。模型驱动的展开方法在保持紧凑性的同时提升性能，因此提出SSIU结合两者优势。

Method: SSIU通过展开基于结构相似性约束的优化函数设计，包含混合尺度门控模块（MSGM）和高效稀疏注意力模块（ESAM），并设计了基于专家混合的特征选择器（MoE-FS）利用多级特征。

Result: 实验证明SSIU在性能和效率上优于当前最优模型，参数更少且内存消耗更低。

Conclusion: SSIU通过结合数据驱动和模型驱动的优势，实现了高效且高性能的图像超分辨率。

Abstract: Major efforts in data-driven image super-resolution (SR) primarily focus on
expanding the receptive field of the model to better capture contextual
information. However, these methods are typically implemented by stacking
deeper networks or leveraging transformer-based attention mechanisms, which
consequently increases model complexity. In contrast, model-driven methods
based on the unfolding paradigm show promise in improving performance while
effectively maintaining model compactness through sophisticated module design.
Based on these insights, we propose a Structural Similarity-Inspired Unfolding
(SSIU) method for efficient image SR. This method is designed through unfolding
an SR optimization function constrained by structural similarity, aiming to
combine the strengths of both data-driven and model-driven approaches. Our
model operates progressively following the unfolding paradigm. Each iteration
consists of multiple Mixed-Scale Gating Modules (MSGM) and an Efficient Sparse
Attention Module (ESAM). The former implements comprehensive constraints on
features, including a structural similarity constraint, while the latter aims
to achieve sparse activation. In addition, we design a Mixture-of-Experts-based
Feature Selector (MoE-FS) that fully utilizes multi-level feature information
by combining features from different steps. Extensive experiments validate the
efficacy and efficiency of our unfolding-inspired network. Our model
outperforms current state-of-the-art models, boasting lower parameter counts
and reduced memory consumption. Our code will be available at:

Motivation: 开发一种参数和内存高效的模型，适用于任何模态的头图像颅骨剥离，以提升效率和硬件兼容性。

Method: 基于频谱解释的扩张卷积架构，仅使用模态无关的合成数据进行训练。

Result: 在606例多模态脑扫描上测试，平均Dice分数为95.9，显著优于ROBEX和BET，与SynthStrip性能相当或更优，且参数减少95%。

Conclusion: MindGrab在保持高精度的同时大幅降低资源需求，适用于更广泛的硬件环境。

Abstract: We developed MindGrab, a parameter- and memory-efficient deep
fully-convolutional model for volumetric skull-stripping in head images of any
modality. Its architecture, informed by a spectral interpretation of dilated
convolutions, was trained exclusively on modality-agnostic synthetic data.
MindGrab was evaluated on a retrospective dataset of 606 multimodal adult-brain
scans (T1, T2, DWI, MRA, PDw MRI, EPI, CT, PET) sourced from the SynthStrip
dataset. Performance was benchmarked against SynthStrip, ROBEX, and BET using
Dice scores, with Wilcoxon signed-rank significance tests. MindGrab achieved a
mean Dice score of 95.9 with standard deviation (SD) 1.6 across modalities,
significantly outperforming classical methods (ROBEX: 89.1 SD 7.7, P < 0.05;
BET: 85.2 SD 14.4, P < 0.05). Compared to SynthStrip (96.5 SD 1.1, P=0.0352),
MindGrab delivered equivalent or superior performance in nearly half of the
tested scenarios, with minor differences (<3% Dice) in the others. MindGrab
utilized 95% fewer parameters (146,237 vs. 2,566,561) than SynthStrip. This
efficiency yielded at least 2x faster inference, 50% lower memory usage on
GPUs, and enabled exceptional performance (e.g., 10-30x speedup, and up to 30x
memory reduction) and accessibility on a wider range of hardware, including
systems without high-end GPUs. MindGrab delivers state-of-the-art accuracy with
dramatically lower resource demands, supported in brainchop-cli

Abstract: The cross-Modality Domain Adaptation (crossMoDA) challenge series, initiated
in 2021 in conjunction with the International Conference on Medical Image
Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI), focuses on unsupervised
cross-modality segmentation, learning from contrast-enhanced T1 (ceT1) and
transferring to T2 MRI. The task is an extreme example of domain shift chosen
to serve as a meaningful and illustrative benchmark. From a clinical
application perspective, it aims to automate Vestibular Schwannoma (VS) and
cochlea segmentation on T2 scans for more cost-effective VS management. Over
time, the challenge objectives have evolved to enhance its clinical relevance.
The challenge evolved from using single-institutional data and basic
segmentation in 2021 to incorporating multi-institutional data and Koos grading
in 2022, and by 2023, it included heterogeneous routine data and
sub-segmentation of intra- and extra-meatal tumour components. In this work, we
report the findings of the 2022 and 2023 editions and perform a retrospective
analysis of the challenge progression over the years. The observations from the
successive challenge contributions indicate that the number of outliers
decreases with an expanding dataset. This is notable since the diversity of
scanning protocols of the datasets concurrently increased. The winning approach
of the 2023 edition reduced the number of outliers on the 2021 and 2022 testing
data, demonstrating how increased data heterogeneity can enhance segmentation
performance even on homogeneous data. However, the cochlea Dice score declined
in 2023, likely due to the added complexity from tumour sub-annotations
affecting overall segmentation performance. While progress is still needed for
clinically acceptable VS segmentation, the plateauing performance suggests that
a more challenging cross-modal task may better serve future benchmarking.

*Jiaqi Wu,Jiahong Ouyang,Farshad Moradi,Mohammad Mehdi Khalighi,Greg Zaharchuk*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 研究比较了扩散模型和非扩散模型在MRI到PET图像转换任务中的表现，发现扩散模型在纯MRI输入时表现最佳，而所有模型在结合低剂量PET时均能准确合成FDG-PET图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于癫痫患者需要同时评估脑结构和代谢，但FDG PET的辐射剂量对年轻人群不利，因此研究旨在通过生成式AI方法（如扩散模型）从MRI或低剂量PET合成诊断质量的PET图像。

Method: 研究比较了两种基于分数的扩散模型（SGM-KD和SGM-VP）和Transformer-Unet模型，使用52名受试者的同步PET/MRI数据（40训练/2验证/10测试），评估了图像质量和临床相关指标。

Result: SGM-KD在纯MRI输入时表现最佳，误差最小且相关性最高；结合1%低剂量PET后，所有模型性能显著提升且表现相近。

Conclusion: 扩散模型在纯MRI到PET转换中潜力巨大，而所有模型均能结合低剂量PET准确合成FDG-PET图像。

Abstract: Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET to evaluate patients with epilepsy is one of the
most common applications for simultaneous PET/MRI, given the need to image both
brain structure and metabolism, but is suboptimal due to the radiation dose in
this young population. Little work has been done synthesizing diagnostic
quality PET images from MRI data or MRI data with ultralow-dose PET using
advanced generative AI methods, such as diffusion models, with attention to
clinical evaluations tailored for the epilepsy population. Here we compared the
performance of diffusion- and non-diffusion-based deep learning models for the
MRI-to-PET image translation task for epilepsy imaging using simultaneous
PET/MRI in 52 subjects (40 train/2 validate/10 hold-out test). We tested three
different models: 2 score-based generative diffusion models (SGM-Karras
Diffusion [SGM-KD] and SGM-variance preserving [SGM-VP]) and a
Transformer-Unet. We report results on standard image processing metrics as
well as clinically relevant metrics, including congruency measures (Congruence
Index and Congruency Mean Absolute Error) that assess hemispheric metabolic
asymmetry, which is a key part of the clinical analysis of these images. The
SGM-KD produced the best qualitative and quantitative results when synthesizing
PET purely from T1w and T2 FLAIR images with the least mean absolute error in
whole-brain specific uptake value ratio (SUVR) and highest intraclass
correlation coefficient. When 1% low-dose PET images are included in the
inputs, all models improve significantly and are interchangeable for
quantitative performance and visual quality. In summary, SGMs hold great
potential for pure MRI-to-PET translation, while all 3 model types can
synthesize full-dose FDG-PET accurately using MRI and ultralow-dose PET.

Main category: cs.ET

TL;DR: 本文探讨了参数偏移规则（PSR）在单元光学神经网络（UONNs）中计算梯度的应用，提出了一种绕过传统反向传播局限性的硬件测量方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统反向传播在光学神经网络中因物理限制难以实现，需要一种适应光学系统特性的梯度计算方法。

Method: 利用PSR通过参数偏移值评估函数计算梯度，结合马赫-曾德尔干涉仪网格的傅里叶级数特性，直接从硬件测量中获取精确解析梯度。

Result: 该方法为光学神经网络提供了一种高效训练策略，避免了有限差分近似和全光学反向传播的局限性。

Conclusion: PSR为光学计算系统的硬件训练策略提供了潜在进展，优化了相位参数的计算方法。

Abstract: This paper explores the application of the parameter-shift rule (PSR) for
computing gradients in unitary optical neural networks (UONNs). While
backpropagation has been fundamental to training conventional neural networks,
its implementation in optical neural networks faces significant challenges due
to the physical constraints of optical systems. We demonstrate how PSR, which
calculates gradients by evaluating functions at shifted parameter values, can
be effectively adapted for training UONNs constructed from Mach-Zehnder
interferometer meshes. The method leverages the inherent Fourier series nature
of optical interference in these systems to compute exact analytical gradients
directly from hardware measurements. This approach offers a promising
alternative to traditional in silico training methods and circumvents the
limitations of both finite difference approximations and all-optical
backpropagation implementations. We present the theoretical framework and
practical methodology for applying PSR to optimize phase parameters in optical
neural networks, potentially advancing the development of efficient
hardware-based training strategies for optical computing systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型的HQFNN模型，结合模糊推理和量子电路，实现了高效、鲁棒的图像分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习视觉系统在噪声输入和模型解释性上的不足，结合模糊推理的透明性和量子电路的高效性。

Method: 通过量子电路实现模糊推理流程，将图像特征映射到量子比特状态，结合轻量级CNN特征提取器进行分类。

Result: 在标准图像基准测试中，HQFNN性能优于经典、模糊增强和纯量子基线模型，且对噪声具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: HQFNN是一种紧凑、可解释且抗噪声的视觉模型，为未来量子模糊学习框架提供了模板。

Abstract: Deep learning vision systems excel at pattern recognition yet falter when
inputs are noisy or the model must explain its own confidence. Fuzzy inference,
with its graded memberships and rule transparency, offers a remedy, while
parameterized quantum circuits can embed features in richly entangled Hilbert
spaces with striking parameter efficiency. Bridging these ideas, this study
introduces a innovative Highly Quantized Fuzzy Neural Network (HQFNN) that
realises the entire fuzzy pipeline inside a shallow quantum circuit and couples
the resulting quantum signal to a lightweight CNN feature extractor. Each image
feature is first mapped to a single qubit membership state through repeated
angle reuploading. Then a compact rule layer refines these amplitudes, and a
clustered CNOT defuzzifier collapses them into one crisp value that is fused
with classical features before classification. Evaluated on standard image
benchmarks, HQFNN consistently surpasses classical, fuzzy enhanced and quantum
only baselines while using several orders of magnitude fewer trainable weights,
and its accuracy degrades only marginally under simulated depolarizing and
amplitude damping noise, evidence of intrinsic robustness. Gate count analysis
further shows that circuit depth grows sublinearly with input dimension,
confirming the model's practicality for larger images. These results position
the model as a compact, interpretable and noise tolerant alternative to
conventional vision backbones and provide a template for future quantum native
fuzzy learning frameworks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统纠错码（如表面码）开销大，不适合早期容错设备，需针对特定噪声结构设计高效纠错方案。

Method: 通过最大化噪声通道后量子态的可区分性，提出可区分性损失函数作为机器学习目标，利用变分技术实现资源高效的编码电路。

Result: VarQEC生成的纠错码在理论和实践中表现优异，优于标准纠错码，并在IBM和IQM硬件上验证了实用性。

Conclusion: VarQEC为量子纠错提供了一种高效且实用的方法，特别适合早期容错设备。

Abstract: Quantum error correction is crucial for protecting quantum information
against decoherence. Traditional codes like the surface code require
substantial overhead, making them impractical for near-term, early
fault-tolerant devices. We propose a novel objective function for tailoring
error correction codes to specific noise structures by maximizing the
distinguishability between quantum states after a noise channel, ensuring
efficient recovery operations. We formalize this concept with the
distinguishability loss function, serving as a machine learning objective to
discover resource-efficient encoding circuits optimized for given noise
characteristics. We implement this methodology using variational techniques,
termed variational quantum error correction (VarQEC). Our approach yields codes
with desirable theoretical and practical properties and outperforms standard
codes in various scenarios. We also provide proof-of-concept demonstrations on
IBM and IQM hardware devices, highlighting the practical relevance of our
procedure.

TL;DR: 变分自编码器（VAEs）通过改进解码器和损失函数，成功提取量子数据的物理特征，无需监督或先验知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子数据的复杂性和随机性使得传统VAEs难以提取有意义的物理特征，需要改进方法。

Method: 采用能忠实再现量子态的解码器和针对量子数据的概率损失函数。

Result: 在量子自旋模型和实验数据中，改进的VAEs成功提取了有意义的物理特征和相结构。

Conclusion: 改进的VAEs是一种无监督且可解释的工具，适用于量子系统的研究。

Abstract: Interpretable machine learning is rapidly becoming a crucial tool for
scientific discovery. Among existing approaches, variational autoencoders
(VAEs) have shown promise in extracting the hidden physical features of some
input data, with no supervision nor prior knowledge of the system at study.
Yet, the ability of VAEs to create meaningful, interpretable representations
relies on their accurate approximation of the underlying probability
distribution of their input. When dealing with quantum data, VAEs must hence
account for its intrinsic randomness and complex correlations. While VAEs have
been previously applied to quantum data, they have often neglected its
probabilistic nature, hindering the extraction of meaningful physical
descriptors. Here, we demonstrate that two key modifications enable VAEs to
learn physically meaningful latent representations: a decoder capable of
faithfully reproduce quantum states and a probabilistic loss tailored to this
task. Using benchmark quantum spin models, we identify regimes where standard
methods fail while the representations learned by our approach remain
meaningful and interpretable. Applied to experimental data from Rydberg atom
arrays, the model autonomously uncovers the phase structure without access to
prior labels, Hamiltonian details, or knowledge of relevant order parameters,
highlighting its potential as an unsupervised and interpretable tool for the
study of quantum systems.

Conclusion: 预训练基础模型和染色质可及性数据在gRNA活性预测中具有显著效果。

Abstract: Predicting guide RNA (gRNA) activity is critical for effective CRISPR-Cas12
genome editing but remains challenging due to limited data, variation across
protospacer adjacent motifs (PAMs-short sequence requirements for Cas binding),
and reliance on large-scale training. We investigate whether pre-trained
biological foundation model originally trained on transcriptomic data can
improve gRNA activity estimation even without domain-specific pre-training.
Using embeddings from existing RNA foundation model as input to lightweight
regressor, we show substantial gains over traditional baselines. We also
integrate chromatin accessibility data to capture regulatory context, improving
performance further. Our results highlight the effectiveness of pre-trained
foundation models and chromatin accessibility data for gRNA activity

Motivation: 现有模型忽略了空间分辨率或基因调控信息，无法捕捉细胞间微环境对基因调控的层次依赖性。

Method: HEIST通过层次图变换器建模组织为空间细胞邻域图，每个细胞为基因调控网络图，结合对比学习和掩码自编码目标进行预训练。

Conclusion: HEIST证明了层次建模和基因调控网络表征的重要性，为空间转录组学提供了强大工具。

Abstract: Single-cell transcriptomics has become a great source for data-driven
insights into biology, enabling the use of advanced deep learning methods to
understand cellular heterogeneity and transcriptional regulation at the
single-cell level. With the advent of spatial transcriptomics data we have the
promise of learning about cells within a tissue context as it provides both
spatial coordinates and transcriptomic readouts. However, existing models
either ignore spatial resolution or the gene regulatory information. Gene
regulation in cells can change depending on microenvironmental cues from
neighboring cells, but existing models neglect gene regulatory patterns with
hierarchical dependencies across levels of abstraction. In order to create
contextualized representations of cells and genes from spatial transcriptomics
data, we introduce HEIST, a hierarchical graph transformer-based foundation
model for spatial transcriptomics and proteomics data. HEIST models tissue as
spatial cellular neighborhood graphs, and each cell is, in turn, modeled as a
gene regulatory network graph. The framework includes a hierarchical graph
transformer that performs cross-level message passing and message passing
within levels. HEIST is pre-trained on 22.3M cells from 124 tissues across 15
organs using spatially-aware contrastive learning and masked auto-encoding
objectives. Unsupervised analysis of HEIST representations of cells, shows that
it effectively encodes the microenvironmental influences in cell embeddings,
enabling the discovery of spatially-informed subpopulations that prior models
fail to differentiate. Further, HEIST achieves state-of-the-art results on four
downstream task such as clinical outcome prediction, cell type annotation, gene
imputation, and spatially-informed cell clustering across multiple
technologies, highlighting the importance of hierarchical modeling and
GRN-based representations.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the efficacy and utility of recent advances in
non-local, non-linear image interpolation and extrapolation algorithms,
specifically, ideas based on Implicit Neural Representations (INR), as a tool
for analysis of spatial transcriptomics data. We seek to utilize the microarray
gene expression data sparsely sampled in the healthy human brain, and produce
fully resolved spatial maps of any given gene across the whole brain at a
voxel-level resolution. To do so, we first obtained the 100 top AD risk genes,
whose baseline spatial transcriptional profiles were obtained from the Allen
Human Brain Atlas (AHBA). We adapted Implicit Neural Representation models so
that the pipeline can produce robust voxel-resolution quantitative maps of all
genes. We present a variety of experiments using interpolations obtained from
Abagen as a baseline/reference.

TL;DR: SemanticST是一个基于图深度学习的框架，用于解决空间转录组学数据分析中的噪声、可扩展性和复杂细胞关系建模问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的空间转录组学分析方法在处理噪声数据、可扩展性和复杂细胞关系建模方面存在不足。

Method: SemanticST通过多语义图构建（包括空间邻近性、基因表达相似性和组织域结构）和注意力融合策略，学习解耦的嵌入表示，并使用社区感知的最小割损失提高鲁棒性。

Result: 在多个平台和组织类型上，SemanticST在ARI、NMI和轨迹保真度上比现有方法提升了20%，并在乳腺癌数据中揭示了罕见的临床相关细胞群。

Conclusion: SemanticST提供了一个可扩展、可解释且生物学基础的空间转录组学分析框架，为组织图谱和精准医学铺平了道路。

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies enable gene expression profiling
with spatial resolution, offering unprecedented insights into tissue
organization and disease heterogeneity. However, current analysis methods often
struggle with noisy data, limited scalability, and inadequate modelling of
complex cellular relationships. We present SemanticST, a biologically informed,
graph-based deep learning framework that models diverse cellular contexts
through multi-semantic graph construction. SemanticST builds multiple
context-specific graphs capturing spatial proximity, gene expression
similarity, and tissue domain structure, and learns disentangled embeddings for
each. These are fused using an attention-inspired strategy to yield a unified,
biologically meaningful representation. A community-aware min-cut loss improves
robustness over contrastive learning, particularly in sparse ST data.
SemanticST supports mini-batch training, making it the first graph neural
network scalable to large-scale datasets such as Xenium (500,000 cells).
Benchmarking across four platforms (Visium, Slide-seq, Stereo-seq, Xenium) and
multiple human and mouse tissues shows consistent 20 percentage gains in ARI,
NMI, and trajectory fidelity over DeepST, GraphST, and IRIS. In re-analysis of
breast cancer Xenium data, SemanticST revealed rare and clinically significant
niches, including triple receptor-positive clusters, spatially distinct
DCIS-to-IDC transition zones, and FOXC2 tumour-associated myoepithelial cells,
suggesting non-canonical EMT programs with stem-like features. SemanticST thus
provides a scalable, interpretable, and biologically grounded framework for
spatial transcriptomics analysis, enabling robust discovery across tissue types
and diseases, and paving the way for spatially resolved tissue atlases and
next-generation precision medicine.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于机器学习的微流变框架，利用激光诱导惯性空化（LIC）和新型Bubble Dynamics Transformer（BDT）神经网络，实现了在超高应变率下对生物材料粘弹性的快速、准确和非接触表征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统流变学工具在高应变率（>1000 1/s）下存在加载速度、分辨率或侵入性限制，需要一种新方法来研究软生物材料在极端条件下的力学特性。

Method: 通过超高速成像捕捉LIC事件中气泡半径的动态变化，并利用基于物理模拟数据训练的BDT神经网络分析数据，直接推断材料粘弹性参数。

Result: BDT能够准确推断材料粘弹性参数，无需迭代拟合或复杂反演过程，实现了快速、准确和非接触的材料表征。

Conclusion: 该方法为生物医学和材料科学中的极端加载条件提供了高效、非侵入性的材料特性表征工具。

Abstract: Laser-induced inertial cavitation (LIC)-where microscale vapor bubbles
nucleate due to a focused high-energy pulsed laser and then violently collapse
under surrounding high local pressures-offers a unique opportunity to
investigate soft biological material mechanics at extremely high strain rates
(>1000 1/s). Traditional rheological tools are often limited in these regimes
by loading speed, resolution, or invasiveness. Here we introduce novel machine
learning (ML) based microrheological frameworks that leverage LIC to
characterize the viscoelastic properties of biological materials at ultra-high
strain rates. We utilize ultra-high-speed imaging to capture time-resolved
bubble radius dynamics during LIC events in various soft viscoelastic
materials. These bubble radius versus time measurements are then analyzed using
a newly developed Bubble Dynamics Transformer (BDT), a neural network trained
on physics-based simulation data. The BDT accurately infers material
viscoelastic parameters, eliminating the need for iterative fitting or complex
inversion processes. This enables fast, accurate, and non-contact
characterization of soft materials under extreme loading conditions, with
significant implications for biomedical applications and materials science.

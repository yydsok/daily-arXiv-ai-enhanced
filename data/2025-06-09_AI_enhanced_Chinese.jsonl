This paper introduces Contextual Memory\nIntelligence (CMI) as a new foundational paradigm for building intelligent\nsystems. It repositions memory as an adaptive infrastructure necessary for\nlongitudinal coherence, explainability, and responsible decision-making rather\nthan passive data. Drawing on cognitive science, organizational theory,\nhuman-computer interaction, and AI governance, CMI formalizes the structured\ncapture, inference, and regeneration of context as a fundamental system\ncapability. The Insight Layer is presented in this paper to operationalize this\nvision. This modular architecture uses human-in-the-loop reflection, drift\ndetection, and rationale preservation to incorporate contextual memory into\nsystems. The paper argues that CMI allows systems to reason with data, history,\njudgment, and changing context, thereby addressing a foundational blind spot in\ncurrent AI architectures and governance efforts.

Existing literature reveals there is a limited\navailability of TOG datasets for training and benchmarking despite large\ndemand, which are often synthetic or have artifacts in mask annotations that\nhinder model performance. Moreover, TOG solutions often require affordance\nmasks, grasps, and object masks for training, however, existing datasets\ntypically provide only a subset of these annotations. To address these\nlimitations, we introduce the Top-down Task-oriented Grasping (TD-TOG) dataset,\ndesigned to train and evaluate TOG solutions. TD-TOG comprises 1,449 real-world\nRGB-D scenes including 30 object categories and 120 subcategories, with\nhand-annotated object masks, affordances, and planar rectangular grasps. It\nalso features a test set for a novel challenge that assesses a TOG solution's\nability to distinguish between object subcategories. To contribute to the\ndemand for TOG solutions that can adapt and manipulate previously unseen\nobjects without re-training, we propose a novel TOG framework, Binary-TOG.\nBinary-TOG uses zero-shot for object recognition, and one-shot learning for\naffordance recognition. Zero-shot learning enables Binary-TOG to identify\nobjects in multi-object scenes through textual prompts, eliminating the need\nfor visual references. In multi-object settings, Binary-TOG achieves an average\ntask-oriented grasp accuracy of 68.9%.

In this\npaper, we present the Multi-Grained Target Perception network (MTPNet) to\nincorporate the prior knowledge of interactions between the molecules and their\ntarget proteins. Specifically, MTPNet is a unified framework for activity cliff\nprediction, which consists of two components: Macro-level Target Semantic (MTS)\nguidance and Micro-level Pocket Semantic (MPS) guidance. By this way, MTPNet\ndynamically optimizes molecular representations through multi-grained protein\nsemantic conditions. To our knowledge, it is the first time to employ the\nreceptor proteins as guiding information to effectively capture critical\ninteraction details. Extensive experiments on 30 representative activity cliff\ndatasets demonstrate that MTPNet significantly outperforms previous approaches,\nachieving an average RMSE improvement of 18.95% on top of several mainstream\nGNN architectures.

Currently, apple\nharvesting fully relies on manual labor, which is costly, drudging, and\nhazardous to workers. Hence, robotic harvesting has attracted increasing\nattention in recent years. However, existing systems still fall short in terms\nof performance, effectiveness, and reliability for complex orchard\nenvironments. In this work, we present the development and evaluation of a\ndual-arm harvesting robot. The system integrates a ToF camera, two 4DOF robotic\narms, a centralized vacuum system, and a post-harvest handling module. During\nharvesting, suction force is dynamically assigned to either arm via the vacuum\nsystem, enabling efficient apple detachment while reducing power consumption\nand noise. Compared to our previous design, we incorporated a platform movement\nmechanism that enables both in-out and up-down adjustments, enhancing the\nrobot's dexterity and adaptability to varying canopy structures. On the\nalgorithmic side, we developed a robust apple localization pipeline that\ncombines a foundation-model-based detector, segmentation, and clustering-based\ndepth estimation, which improves performance in orchards. Additionally,\npressure sensors were integrated into the system, and a novel dual-arm\ncoordination strategy was introduced to respond to harvest failures based on\nsensor feedback, further improving picking efficiency. Field demos were\nconducted in two commercial orchards in MI, USA, with different canopy\nstructures.

Vector Quantization (VQ), a\nclustering-based quantization method, serves as a prevalent solution to this\nissue for its extremely low-bit (even at 2-bit) and considerable accuracy.\nSince a vector is a quantity in mathematics and physics that has both direction\nand magnitude, existing VQ works typically quantize them in a coupled manner.\nHowever, we find that direction exhibits significantly greater sensitivity to\nquantization compared to the magnitude. For instance, when separately\nclustering the directions and magnitudes of weight vectors in LLaMA-2-7B, the\naccuracy drop of zero-shot tasks are 46.5\\% and 2.3\\%, respectively. This gap\neven increases with the reduction of clustering centers. Further, Euclidean\ndistance, a common metric to access vector similarities in current VQ works,\nplaces greater emphasis on reducing the magnitude error. This property is\ncontrary to the above finding, unavoidably leading to larger quantization\nerrors. To these ends, this paper proposes Polar Coordinate Decoupled Vector\nQuantization (PCDVQ), an effective and efficient VQ framework consisting of two\nkey modules: 1) Polar Coordinate Decoupling (PCD), which transforms vectors\ninto their polar coordinate representations and perform independent\nquantization of the direction and magnitude parameters.2) Distribution Aligned\nCodebook Construction (DACC), which optimizes the direction and magnitude\ncodebooks in accordance with the source distribution.

The dual-view format inherently provides binocular disparity cues\nthat enhance depth perception and realism, making it indispensable for fields\nsuch as telepresence, 3D mapping, and robotic vision. Until recently, however,\nend-to-end pipelines for capturing, encoding, and viewing high-quality 3D video\nwere neither widely accessible nor optimized for consumer-grade devices.\nToday's smartphones, such as the iPhone Pro, and modern Head-Mounted Displays\n(HMDs), like the Apple Vision Pro (AVP), offer built-in support for\nstereoscopic video capture, hardware-accelerated encoding, and seamless\nplayback on devices like the Apple Vision Pro and Meta Quest 3, requiring\nminimal user intervention. Apple refers to this streamlined workflow as spatial\nvideo. Making the full stereoscopic video process available to everyone has\nmade new applications possible. Despite these advances, there remains a notable\nabsence of publicly available datasets that include the complete spatial video\npipeline.\n  In this paper, we introduce SVD, a spatial video dataset comprising 300\nfive-second video sequences, 150 captured using an iPhone Pro and 150 with an\nAVP.

A central challenge in\nengineering the necessary reward function(s) comes from these environments\ncontaining states that carry high negative rewards, but provide no feedback to\nthe agent.

Mapping Reparative Actions in AI through Justice Frameworks", "categories": ["cs.HC"], "comment": null, "summary": "As Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are integrated into more aspects of\nsociety, they offer new capabilities but also cause a range of harms that are\ndrawing increasing scrutiny. A large body of work in the Responsible AI\ncommunity has focused on identifying and auditing these harms. However, much\nless is understood about what happens after harm occurs: what constitutes\nreparation, who initiates it, and how effective these reparations are. In this\npaper, we develop a taxonomy of AI harm reparation based on a thematic analysis\nof real-world incidents. The taxonomy organizes reparative actions into four\noverarching goals: acknowledging harm, attributing responsibility, providing\nremedies, and enabling systemic change. We apply this framework to a dataset of\n1,060 AI-related incidents, analyzing the prevalence of each action and the\ndistribution of stakeholder involvement.

However,\nthese methods struggle with complex scenes, especially when dynamic changes in\nobject position, material, and size significantly alter sound effects. These\ncontinuous variations lead to fluctuating acoustic transfer distributions,\nmaking it challenging to represent with basic data structures and render\nefficiently in real time. To address this challenge, we present Neural Acoustic\nTransfer, a novel approach that utilizes an implicit neural representation to\nencode precomputed acoustic transfer and its variations, allowing for real-time\nprediction of sound fields under varying conditions. To efficiently generate\nthe training data required for the neural acoustic field, we developed a fast\nMonte-Carlo-based boundary element method (BEM) approximation for general\nscenarios with smooth Neumann conditions. Additionally, we implemented a\nGPU-accelerated version of standard BEM for scenarios requiring higher\nprecision.

Although LLMs have shown\nremarkable progress in working with tables (e.g., in spreadsheet and database\ncopilot scenarios), comprehensive benchmarking of such capabilities remains\nlimited. In contrast to an extensive and growing list of NLP benchmarks,\nevaluations of table-related tasks are scarce, and narrowly focus on tasks like\nNL-to-SQL and Table-QA, overlooking the broader spectrum of real-world tasks\nthat professional users face. This gap limits our understanding and model\nprogress in this important area.\n  In this work, we introduce MMTU, a large-scale benchmark with over 30K\nquestions across 25 real-world table tasks, designed to comprehensively\nevaluate models ability to understand, reason, and manipulate real tables at\nthe expert-level.

In this work, we explore how multimodal large language models (MLLMs)\ncan be aligned with the reasoning processes of speech-language pathologists\n(SLPs) to support the interpretation of everyday parent-child interactions. We\nconducted in-depth interviews and video annotation studies with three\nexperienced SLPs to uncover how they evaluate joint attention based on three\ncore behavioural cues: gaze, action, and vocalisation. Using these insights, we\ndeveloped a two-stage MLLM-based system that first extracts fine-grained\nbehavioural descriptions from video segments and then judge joint attention\nquality using expert-aligned prompts. Our evaluation across 26 parent-child\ninteraction videos shows that MLLMs can achieve up to 85% accuracy in\nperceptual cue extraction and over 75% average precision in simulating expert\njudgement. We further propose design guidelines for building MLLM-based\nbehaviour observation-judgement systems that align with SLPs, emphasising the\nstructuring of behavioural cues, the construction of exemplar libraries\ngrounded in expert annotations, and the need to personalise system responses\nbased on developmental stage and neurotypical or atypical presentation.

Through extensive\nevaluations, we show that the models fine-tuned with the SPRINT framework match\nthe performance of reasoning models on complex domains such as mathematics\nwhile generating up to ~39% fewer sequential tokens on problems requiring more\nthan 8000 output tokens.

We find that language models\nundergo loss deceleration early in training; an abrupt slowdown in the rate of\nloss improvement, resulting in piecewise linear behaviour of the loss curve in\nlog-log space. Scaling up the model mitigates this transition by (1) decreasing\nthe loss at which deceleration occurs, and (2) improving the log-log rate of\nloss improvement after deceleration. We attribute loss deceleration to a type\nof degenerate training dynamics we term zero-sum learning (ZSL). In ZSL,\nper-example gradients become systematically opposed, leading to destructive\ninterference in per-example changes in loss.

One attempt is scenario-based assessment\n(SBA), a technique that not only measures but also fosters the development of\ncompetencies throughout the assessment process. SBA introduces simulated agents\nto provide an authentic social-interactional context, allowing for the\nassessment of competency-based constructs while mitigating the unpredictability\nof real-life interactions. Recent advancements in multimodal AI, such as\ntext-to-video technology, allow these agents to be enhanced into AI-generated\ncharacters. This mixed-method study investigates how learners perceive AI\ncharacters taking the role of mentor and teammates in an SBA mirroring the\ncontext of a collaborative science investigation. Specifically, we examined the\nLikert scale responses of 56 high schoolers regarding trust, social presence,\nand effectiveness. We analyzed the relationships between these factors and\ntheir impact on the intention to adopt AI characters through PLS-SEM. Our\nfindings indicated that learners' trust shaped their sense of social presence\nwith the AI characters, enhancing perceived effectiveness. Qualitative analysis\nfurther highlighted factors that foster trust, such as material credibility and\nalignment with learning goals, as well as the pivotal role of social presence\nin creating a collaborative context.\n  This paper was accepted as an full paper for AIED 2025.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86AI\u751f\u6210\u89d2\u8272\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u60c5\u5883\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\uff08SBA\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u5bf9AI\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\u3001\u793e\u4f1a\u5b58\u5728\u611f\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u91c7\u7528\u610f\u613f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "21\u4e16\u7eaa\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u8981\u6c42\u57f9\u517b\u590d\u6742\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u8bfe\u5802\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0cAI\u89d2\u8272\u53ef\u80fd\u5f25\u5408\u8fd9\u4e00\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Likert\u91cf\u8868\u548cPLS-SEM\u5206\u679056\u540d\u9ad8\u4e2d\u751f\u5bf9AI\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\u3001\u793e\u4f1a\u5b58\u5728\u611f\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u3002", "result": "\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\u5f71\u54cd\u5176\u793e\u4f1a\u5b58\u5728\u611f\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u611f\u77e5\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff1b\u6750\u6599\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u76ee\u6807\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u662f\u4fe1\u4efb\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "conclusion": "AI\u89d2\u8272\u5728SBA\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4fe1\u4efb\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u5b58\u5728\u611f\u662f\u5176\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u5173\u952e\u3002"}}

We propose Talk2SAM, a novel approach\nthat integrates textual guidance to improve segmentation of such challenging\nobjects.

Beyond improving\nsegmentation accuracy, Talk2SAM allows user-controllable segmentation, enabling\ndisambiguation of objects within a single bounding box based on textual input.\nWe evaluate our approach on three benchmarks: BIG, ThinObject5K, and DIS5K.\nTalk2SAM consistently outperforms SAM-HQ, achieving up to +5.9\\% IoU and +8.3\\%\nboundary IoU improvements.

We study these mid-level representations across three critical\ndimensions: object-centricity, pose-awareness, and depth-awareness. We use\nthese interpretable mid-level representations to train specialist encoders via\nsupervised learning, then feed them as inputs to a diffusion policy to solve\ndexterous bimanual manipulation tasks in the real world. We propose a novel\nmixture-of-experts policy architecture that combines multiple specialized\nexpert models, each trained on a distinct mid-level representation, to improve\npolicy generalization. This method achieves an average success rate that is 11%\nhigher than a language-grounded baseline and 24 percent higher than a standard\ndiffusion policy baseline on our evaluation tasks. Furthermore, we find that\nleveraging mid-level representations as supervision signals for policy actions\nwithin a weighted imitation learning algorithm improves the precision with\nwhich the policy follows these representations, yielding an additional\nperformance increase of 10%.

Previous work has predominantly focused on rule-based agent-based\nmodeling (ABM) and deep learning methods.

Moreover, both lines of work lack the\ncognitive flexibility to adapt to changing environments. Leveraging the\ncapabilities of large language models (LLMs), we propose CrimeMind, a novel\nLLM-driven ABM framework for simulating urban crime within a multi-modal urban\ncontext.A key innovation of our design is the integration of the Routine\nActivity Theory (RAT) into the agentic workflow of CrimeMind, enabling it to\nprocess rich multi-modal urban features and reason about criminal\nbehavior.However, RAT requires LLM agents to infer subtle cues in evaluating\nenvironmental safety as part of assessing guardianship, which can be\nchallenging for LLMs. To address this, we collect a small-scale human-annotated\ndataset and align CrimeMind's perception with human judgment via a\ntraining-free textual gradient method.Experiments across four major U.S. cities\ndemonstrate that CrimeMind outperforms both traditional ABMs and deep learning\nbaselines in crime hotspot prediction and spatial distribution accuracy,\nachieving up to a 24% improvement over the strongest baseline.Furthermore, we\nconduct counterfactual simulations of external incidents and policy\ninterventions and it successfully captures the expected changes in crime\npatterns, demonstrating its ability to reflect counterfactual\nscenarios.Overall, CrimeMind enables fine-grained modeling of individual\nbehaviors and facilitates evaluation of real-world interventions.", "AI": {"tldr": "CrimeMind\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86Routine Activity Theory\uff08RAT\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u57ce\u5e02\u72af\u7f6a\u3002\u5b83\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57ce\u5e02\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684ABM\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u6216\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9002\u5e94\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002CrimeMind\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7LLM\u548cRAT\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "CrimeMind\u6574\u5408\u4e86RAT\u5230LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684ABM\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57ce\u5e02\u7279\u5f81\u63a8\u7406\u72af\u7f6a\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4eba\u7c7b\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6587\u672c\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u9f50\u6a21\u578b\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u7f8e\u56fd\u57ce\u5e02\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cCrimeMind\u5728\u72af\u7f6a\u70ed\u70b9\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfABM\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe24%\u3002\u8fd8\u80fd\u6a21\u62df\u5916\u90e8\u4e8b\u4ef6\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u5e72\u9884\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "CrimeMind\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u884c\u4e3a\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30\u73b0\u5b9e\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\uff0c\u4e3a\u57ce\u5e02\u72af\u7f6a\u6a21\u62df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

A key reason is the lack of a large and uniform dataset for\nteaching robots manipulation skills. Current robot datasets often record robot\naction in different action spaces within a simple scene. This hinders the robot\nto learn a unified and robust action representation for different robots within\ndiverse scenes. Observing how humans understand a manipulation task, we find\nthat understanding how the objects should move in the 3D space is a critical\nclue for guiding actions. This clue is embodiment-agnostic and suitable for\nboth humans and different robots. Motivated by this, we aim to learn a 3D flow\nworld model from both human and robot manipulation data. This model predicts\nthe future movement of the interacting objects in 3D space, guiding action\nplanning for manipulation. Specifically, we synthesize a large-scale 3D optical\nflow dataset, named ManiFlow-110k, through a moving object auto-detect\npipeline. A video diffusion-based world model then learns manipulation physics\nfrom these data, generating 3D optical flow trajectories conditioned on\nlanguage instructions. With the generated 3D object optical flow, we propose a\nflow-guided rendering mechanism, which renders the predicted final state and\nleverages GPT-4o to assess whether the predicted flow aligns with the task\ndescription. This equips the robot with a closed-loop planning ability.\nFinally, we consider the predicted 3D optical flow as constraints for an\noptimization policy to determine a chunk of robot actions for manipulation.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate strong generalization across diverse robotic\nmanipulation tasks and reliable cross-embodiment adaptation without\nhardware-specific training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e3D\u5149\u6d41\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6307\u5bfc\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6ManiFlow-110k\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u4ee4\u751f\u62103D\u5149\u6d41\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8de8\u786c\u4ef6\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u6027\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b66\u4e60\u901a\u7528\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u8868\u793a\u3002\u4eba\u7c7b\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u89e3\u7269\u4f53\u57283D\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u7ebf\u7d22\u4e0e\u5177\u4f53\u786c\u4ef6\u65e0\u5173\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u3002", "method": "\u5408\u6210\u5927\u89c4\u6a213D\u5149\u6d41\u6570\u636e\u96c6ManiFlow-110k\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u64cd\u4f5c\u7269\u7406\u89c4\u5f8b\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u4ee4\u76843D\u5149\u6d41\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528GPT-4o\u8bc4\u4f30\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u751f\u6210\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u52a8\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u786c\u4ef6\u7279\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u786c\u4ef6\u9002\u914d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e3D\u5149\u6d41\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8de8\u786c\u4ef6\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

The proposed method builds upon the concept of Velocity\nObstacles (VO) that was later extended to Nonlinear Velocity Obstacles (NLVO)\nto account for obstacles moving along nonlinear trajectories. The NLVO is\nextended in this paper to Acceleration Obstacles (AO) and Nonlinear\nAcceleration Obstacles (NAO) that account for velocity and acceleration\nconstraints. Multi-robot navigation is achieved by using the same avoidance\nalgorithm by all robots. At each time step, the trajectories of all robots are\npredicted based on their current velocity and acceleration to allow the\ncomputation of their respective NLVO, AO and NAO.\n  The introduction of AO and NAO allows the generation of safe avoidance\nmaneuvers that account for the robot dynamic constraints better than could be\ndone with the NLVO alone. This paper demonstrates the use of AO and NAO for\nrobot navigation in challenging environments. It is shown that using AO and NAO\nenables simultaneous real-time collision avoidance while accounting for robot\nkinematics and a direct consideration of its dynamic constraints.

One popular example is the usage of graph Laplacian\neigenvectors for positional encoding in MPNNs and Graph Transformers. The\nexpressive power of such Spectrally-enhanced GNNs (SGNNs) is usually evaluated\nvia the k-WL graph isomorphism test hierarchy and homomorphism counting. Yet,\nthese frameworks align poorly with the graph spectra, yielding limited insight\ninto SGNNs' expressive power.

We explore minoritised ethnic people's\nexperiences of using essential online services across three sectors: health,\nsocial housing, and energy, their security and privacy-related concerns, and\nresponses towards these services. We conducted a thematic analysis of 44\nsemi-structured interviews with people of various reported minoritised\nethnicities in the UK. Privacy concerns and lack of control over personal data\nemerged as a major theme, with many interviewees considering privacy as their\nmost significant concern when using online services. Several creative tactics\nto exercise some agency were reported, including selective and inconsistent\ndisclosure of personal data. A core concern about how data may be used was\ndriven by a fear of repercussions, including penalisation and discrimination,\ninfluenced by prior experiences of institutional and online racism. The\nincreased concern and potential for harm resulted in minoritised ethnic people\ngrappling with a higher-stakes dilemma of whether to disclose personal\ninformation online or not. Furthermore, trust in institutions, or lack thereof,\nwas found to be embedded throughout as a basis for adapting behaviour. We draw\non our results to provide lessons learned for the design of more inclusive,\nmarginalisation-aware, and privacy-preserving online services.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5c11\u6570\u65cf\u88d4\u7fa4\u4f53\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u5728\u7ebf\u670d\u52a1\u65f6\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4ed6\u4eec\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u62c5\u5fe7\u53ca\u5e94\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c11\u6570\u65cf\u88d4\u5728\u793e\u4f1a\u4e2d\u88ab\u8fb9\u7f18\u5316\uff0c\u9762\u4e34\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u9690\u79c1\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4f46\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\u8f83\u5c11\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u82f1\u56fd44\u540d\u5c11\u6570\u65cf\u88d4\u8fdb\u884c\u534a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bbf\u8c08\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u4e3b\u9898\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u9690\u79c1\u62c5\u5fe7\u548c\u6570\u636e\u63a7\u5236\u7f3a\u5931\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53d7\u8bbf\u8005\u91c7\u53d6\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u62ab\u9732\u7b49\u7b56\u7565\u5e94\u5bf9\u3002\u5bf9\u673a\u6784\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\u5ea6\u5f71\u54cd\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u5177\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u670d\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u542f\u793a\u3002"}}

Due to the rarity of system\nfailures, ensuring their safety in complex operating environments remains a\nmajor challenge, which severely hinders their large-scale deployment in\nsafety-critical domains, such as autonomous vehicles, medical devices, and\nrobotics. While achieving provable deterministic safety--verifying system\nsafety across all possible scenarios--remains theoretically ideal, the rarity\nand complexity of corner cases make this approach impractical for scalable\nembodied AI systems. To address this challenge, we introduce provable\nprobabilistic safety, which aims to ensure that the residual risk of\nlarge-scale deployment remains below a predefined threshold. Instead of\nattempting exhaustive safety proof across all corner cases, this paradigm\nestablishes a probabilistic safety boundary on overall system performance,\nleveraging statistical methods to enhance feasibility and scalability. A\nwell-defined probabilistic safety boundary enables embodied AI systems to be\ndeployed at scale while allowing for continuous refinement of safety\nguarantees. Our work focuses on three core questions: what is provable\nprobabilistic safety, how to prove the probabilistic safety, and how to achieve\nthe provable probabilistic safety.

Recent works have shown\npromising results in estimating part pose and size at the category level.\nHowever, these approaches primarily follow a complex multi-stage pipeline that\nfirst segments part instances in the point cloud and then estimates the\nNormalized Part Coordinate Space (NPCS) representation for 6D poses. These\napproaches suffer from high computational costs and low performance in\nreal-time robotic tasks. To address these limitations, we propose YOEO, a\nsingle-stage method that simultaneously outputs instance segmentation and NPCS\nrepresentations in an end-to-end manner. We use a unified network to generate\npoint-wise semantic labels and centroid offsets, allowing points from the same\npart instance to vote for the same centroid. We further utilize a clustering\nalgorithm to distinguish points based on their estimated centroid distances.\nFinally, we first separate the NPCS region of each instance. Then, we align the\nseparated regions with the real point cloud to recover the final pose and size.\nExperimental results on the GAPart dataset demonstrate the pose estimation\ncapabilities of our proposed single-shot method. We also deploy our\nsynthetically-trained model in a real-world setting, providing real-time visual\nfeedback at 200Hz, enabling a physical Kinova robot to interact with unseen\narticulated objects.

We find that as task diversity increases, transformers undergo a\ntransition from a specialized solution, which exhibits ICL only within the\npretraining task distribution, to a solution which generalizes out of\ndistribution to the entire task space. We also investigate the nature of the\nsolutions learned by the transformer on both sides of the transition, and\nobserve similar transitions in nonlinear regression problems. We construct a\nphase diagram to characterize how our concept of task diversity interacts with\nthe number of pretraining tasks. In addition, we explore how factors such as\nthe depth of the model and the dimensionality of the regression problem\ninfluence the transition.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u5e03\u4e2d\u4efb\u52a1\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5bf9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\uff08ICL\uff09\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4efb\u52a1\u591a\u6837\u6027\u589e\u52a0\u65f6\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u4ec5\u9002\u5e94\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u5e03\u8fc7\u6e21\u5230\u6cdb\u5316\u81f3\u6574\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u5e03\u4e2d\u4efb\u52a1\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5bf9ICL\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u6cdb\u5316\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u51fd\u6570\u8bad\u7ec3\u53d8\u6362\u5668\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4efb\u52a1\u591a\u6837\u6027\u589e\u52a0\u65f6\u7684ICL\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u4efb\u52a1\u591a\u6837\u6027\u589e\u52a0\u65f6\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u9002\u5e94\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u5e03\u8fc7\u6e21\u5230\u6cdb\u5316\u81f3\u6574\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u76f8\u56fe\u63cf\u8ff0\u8fd9\u4e00\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4efb\u52a1\u591a\u6837\u6027\u662fICL\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u95ee\u9898\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e5f\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u8fd9\u4e00\u8fc7\u6e21\u3002"}}

Existing approaches adapt LLMs by traversing relational\nlinks between entities in a database and converting the structured data into\nflat text documents. Still, this text-based serialization disregards critical\nrelational structures, introduces redundancy, and often exceeds standard LLM\ncontext lengths. We introduce Rel-LLM, a novel architecture that utilizes a\ngraph neural network (GNN)- based encoder to generate structured relational\nprompts for LLMs within a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework.\nUnlike traditional text-based serialization approaches, our method preserves\nthe inherent relational structure of databases while enabling LLMs to\neffectively process and reason over complex entity relationships.

These representations are transformed into structured prompts\nusing a denormalization process, effectively allowing the LLM to reason over\nrelational structures. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that\nRel-LLM outperforms existing methods on key RDL tasks, offering a scalable and\nefficient approach to integrating LLMs with structured data sources.

Recent large language models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning with\nverifiable reward (RLVR) have achieved strong logical reasoning performances by\nexposing their intermediate reasoning traces, giving rise to large reasoning\nmodels (LRMs). However, the mechanism behind multilingual reasoning in LRMs is\nnot yet fully explored. To investigate the issue, we fine-tune multilingual\nLRMs with Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on translated versions of\nthe GSM$8$K and SimpleRL-Zoo datasets in three different languages: Chinese,\nKorean, and Ukrainian. During training, we monitor both task accuracy and\nlanguage consistency of the reasoning chains. Our experiments reveal three key\nfindings: (i) GRPO rapidly amplifies pre-training language imbalances, leading\nto the erosion of low-resource languages within just a few hundred updates;\n(ii) language consistency reward mitigates this drift but does so at the\nexpense of an almost 5 - 10 pp drop in accuracy. and (iii) the resulting\nlanguage collapse is severely damaging and largely irreversible, as subsequent\nfine-tuning struggles to steer the model back toward its original\ntarget-language reasoning capabilities.

However,\nmost existing methods rely on uniform or heuristic bitwidth assignments,\nfailing to account for the nonuniform sensitivity of weights to quantization\nnoise. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for allocating quantization\nbitwidths based on sensitivity metrics derived from a Hessian proxy. We make\nkey assumptions, which allow the layer/component-wise loss function to be\nexpressed as an explicit function of the bitwidths. This enables a neat\nformulation of the bit allocation problem as a convex optimization task, whose\nclosed-form solution adapts precision across weights to minimize the layer-wise\nquantization loss. Inspecting the solution provides several insights (such as\nthe equal-loss structure), which are then exploited to design the proposed\n\\textbf{BAQ} (Bit Allocation Quantization) algorithm. The proposed algorithm\nachieves a good trade-off between loss minimization and complexity and allows\nBAQ to be integrated into standard quantization pipelines with minimal\noverhead. Experimental results show that BAQ consistently outperforms GPTQ,\nachieving up to 56$\\times$ lower perplexity at the same bitwidth on large\nlanguage models ranging from 125M to 30B parameters.

However, by building\non recent advances in 3D models such as neural radiance fields, some authors\nhave shown that 3D techniques can at last improve outputs extracted from\nindependent 2D views, by fusing them into 3D and denoising them. This is\nparticularly helpful in egocentric videos, where the camera motion is\nsignificant, but only under the assumption that the scene itself is static. In\nfact, as shown in the recent analysis conducted by EPIC Fields, 3D techniques\nare ineffective when it comes to studying dynamic phenomena, and, in\nparticular, when segmenting moving objects. In this paper, we look into this\nissue in more detail. First, we propose to improve dynamic segmentation in 3D\nby fusing motion segmentation predictions from a 2D-based model into layered\nradiance fields (Layered Motion Fusion). However, the high complexity of long,\ndynamic videos makes it challenging to capture the underlying geometric\nstructure, and, as a result, hinders the fusion of motion cues into the\n(incomplete) scene geometry. We address this issue through test-time\nrefinement, which helps the model to focus on specific frames, thereby reducing\nthe data complexity. This results in a synergy between motion fusion and the\nrefinement, and in turn leads to segmentation predictions of the 3D model that\nsurpass the 2D baseline by a large margin.

A recent review found that only 9% of FDA-registered\nAI-based healthcare tools include a post-deployment surveillance plan. Existing\nmonitoring approaches are often manual, sporadic, and reactive, making them\nill-suited for the dynamic environments in which clinical models operate. We\ncontend that post-deployment monitoring should be grounded in label-efficient\nand statistically valid testing frameworks, offering a principled alternative\nto current practices.

Unlike existing methods that either produce\nmonolithic 3D shapes or follow two-stage pipelines, i.e., first segmenting an\nimage and then reconstructing each segment, PartCrafter adopts a unified,\ncompositional generation architecture that does not rely on pre-segmented\ninputs. Conditioned on a single image, it simultaneously denoises multiple 3D\nparts, enabling end-to-end part-aware generation of both individual objects and\ncomplex multi-object scenes. PartCrafter builds upon a pretrained 3D mesh\ndiffusion transformer (DiT) trained on whole objects, inheriting the pretrained\nweights, encoder, and decoder, and introduces two key innovations: (1) A\ncompositional latent space, where each 3D part is represented by a set of\ndisentangled latent tokens; (2) A hierarchical attention mechanism that enables\nstructured information flow both within individual parts and across all parts,\nensuring global coherence while preserving part-level detail during generation.\nTo support part-level supervision, we curate a new dataset by mining part-level\nannotations from large-scale 3D object datasets. Experiments show that\nPartCrafter outperforms existing approaches in generating decomposable 3D\nmeshes, including parts that are not directly visible in input images,\ndemonstrating the strength of part-aware generative priors for 3D understanding\nand synthesis.

To address the distribution\nmismatch between the received signal and the DM's training data, a\nmathematically principled scaling mechanism is introduced, ensuring robust\nperformance across a wide range of SNRs without requiring model fine-tuning.\nBuilt upon this theoretical insight, we develop a latent diffusion model\n(LDM)-based semantic transceiver, wherein a variational autoencoder (VAE) is\nemployed for efficient semantic compression, and a pretrained DM serves as a\nuniversal denoiser.

In this\nwork, we demonstrate that grokking can be induced by regularization, either\nexplicit or implicit. More precisely, we show that when there exists a model\nwith a property $P$ (e.g., sparse or low-rank weights) that generalizes on the\nproblem of interest, gradient descent with a small but non-zero regularization\nof $P$ (e.g., $\\ell_1$ or nuclear norm regularization) results in grokking.\nThis extends previous work showing that small non-zero weight decay induces\ngrokking.

However, such static datasets often exhibit\ndistribution bias, resulting in limited generalizability. To address this\nlimitation, a straightforward solution is data augmentation (DA), which\nleverages generative models to enrich data distribution. Despite the promising\nresults, current DA techniques focus solely on reconstructing future\ntrajectories from given states, while ignoring the exploration of history\ntransitions that reach them. This single-direction paradigm inevitably hinders\nthe discovery of diverse behavior patterns, especially those leading to\ncritical states that may have yielded high-reward outcomes. In this work, we\nintroduce Bidirectional Trajectory Diffusion (BiTrajDiff), a novel DA framework\nfor offline RL that models both future and history trajectories from any\nintermediate states. Specifically, we decompose the trajectory generation task\ninto two independent yet complementary diffusion processes: one generating\nforward trajectories to predict future dynamics, and the other generating\nbackward trajectories to trace essential history transitions.BiTrajDiff can\nefficiently leverage critical states as anchors to expand into potentially\nvaluable yet underexplored regions of the state space, thereby facilitating\ndataset diversity. Extensive experiments on the D4RL benchmark suite\ndemonstrate that BiTrajDiff achieves superior performance compared to other\nadvanced DA methods across various offline RL backbones.", "AI": {"tldr": "BiTrajDiff\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53cc\u5411\u8f68\u8ff9\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u540c\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u5386\u53f2\u548c\u672a\u6765\u8f68\u8ff9\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6570\u636e\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u9759\u6001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b58\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u672a\u6765\u8f68\u8ff9\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5386\u53f2\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "method": "BiTrajDiff\u5c06\u8f68\u8ff9\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e24\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1a\u524d\u5411\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u540e\u5411\u8ffd\u6eaf\u5386\u53f2\u8fc7\u6e21\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5173\u952e\u72b6\u6001\u4f5c\u4e3a\u951a\u70b9\u6269\u5c55\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u5728D4RL\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cBiTrajDiff\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u5148\u8fdb\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "BiTrajDiff\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5411\u8f68\u8ff9\u751f\u6210\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6570\u636e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

The authors of these studies compared\ntheir schemes to determine the best one. The initial measure used to assess the\ngoodness of a polygonal approximation was figure of merit. Later, it was\npointed out that this measure was not an appropriate metric for a valid reason\nand this is why Rosin - through mathematical analysis - introduced a measure\ncalled merit. However, this measure involves optimal scheme of polygonal\napproximation and so it is time-consuming to compute it to assess the goodness\nof an approximation. This led many researchers to use weighted figure of merit\nas a substitute for Rosin's measure to compare among sub-optimal schemes. An\nattempt is made in this communication to investigate whether the two measures -\nweighted figure of merit and Rosin's measure - are related so that one can be\nused instead of the other and towards this end theoretical analysis,\nexperimental investigation and statistical analysis are carried out. The\nmathematical formula for weighted figure of merit and Rosin's measure are\nanalyzed and through proof of theorems it is found that the two measures are\nindependent of each other theoretically. The graphical analysis of experiments\ncarried out using public dataset supports theoretical analysis. The statistical\nanalysis using Pearson's correlation coefficient also establishes that the two\nmeasures are uncorrelated. This analysis leads one to conclude that if a\nsub-optimal scheme is found to be better (worse) than some other sub-optimal\nscheme as indicated by Rosin's measure then the same conclusion cannot be drawn\nusing weighted figure of merit and so one cannot use weighted figure of merit\ninstead of Rosin's measure.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u591a\u8fb9\u5f62\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff08\u52a0\u6743FOM\u548cRosin's measure\uff09\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u660e\u4e24\u8005\u72ec\u7acb\uff0c\u4e0d\u80fd\u4e92\u76f8\u66ff\u4ee3\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u4e2d\u591a\u8fb9\u5f62\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u52a0\u6743FOM\u548cRosin's measure\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u4e92\u6362\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff08\u6570\u5b66\u516c\u5f0f\u548c\u5b9a\u7406\u8bc1\u660e\uff09\u3001\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff08\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff09\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\uff08Pearson\u76f8\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\uff09\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e24\u79cd\u6307\u6807\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u5747\u8868\u660e\u4e24\u79cd\u6307\u6807\u65e0\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u4e92\u76f8\u66ff\u4ee3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u52a0\u6743FOM\u4e0d\u80fd\u66ff\u4ee3Rosin's measure\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u53ef\u80fd\u56e0\u6307\u6807\u9009\u62e9\u800c\u5f02\u3002"}}

Genuine illusions present discrepancies\nbetween actual and apparent features, whereas fake illusions have the same\nactual and apparent features even though they look illusory due to the similar\ngeometric configuration.

Our findings indicate that although LVLMs may appear to\nrecognize illusions by correctly answering questions about both feature types,\nthey predict the same answers for both Genuine Illusion and Fake Illusion VQA\nquestions. This suggests that their responses might be based on prior knowledge\nof illusions rather than genuine visual understanding.

However, their substantial\ncomputational requirements have constrained their deployment in real-time\ninteractive avatar applications, where stringent speed, latency, and duration\nrequirements are paramount. We present a novel audio-driven portrait video\ngeneration framework based on the diffusion model to address these challenges.\nFirstly, we propose robust variable-length video generation to reduce the\nminimum time required to generate the initial video clip or state transitions,\nwhich significantly enhances the user experience. Secondly, we propose a\nconsistency model training strategy for Audio-Image-to-Video to ensure\nreal-time performance, enabling a fast few-step generation. Model quantization\nand pipeline parallelism are further employed to accelerate the inference\nspeed. To mitigate the stability loss incurred by the diffusion process and\nmodel quantization, we introduce a new inference strategy tailored for\nlong-duration video generation. These methods ensure real-time performance and\nlow latency while maintaining high-fidelity output.

In this work, we introduce DeformCL, a new continuous representation\nbased on Deformable Centerlines, where centerline points act as nodes connected\nby edges that capture spatial relationships. Compared with previous\nrepresentations, DeformCL offers three key advantages: natural connectivity,\nnoise robustness, and interaction facility.

In contrast to conventional reasoning benchmarks\nconsisting of tasks with clear instructions, puzzlehunts require models to\ndiscover the underlying problem structure from multimodal evidence and\niterative reasoning, mirroring real-world domains such as scientific discovery,\nexploratory data analysis, or investigative problem-solving. Despite recent\nprogress in foundation models, their performance on such open-ended settings\nremains largely untested. In this paper, we introduce PuzzleWorld, a\nlarge-scale benchmark of 667 puzzlehunt-style problems designed to assess\nstep-by-step, open-ended, and creative multimodal reasoning. Each puzzle is\nannotated with the final solution, detailed reasoning traces, and cognitive\nskill labels, enabling holistic benchmarking and fine-grained diagnostic\nanalysis. Most state-of-the-art models achieve only 1-2% final answer accuracy,\nwith the best model solving only 14% of puzzles and reaching 40% stepwise\naccuracy. To demonstrate the value of our reasoning annotations, we show that\nfine-tuning a small model on reasoning traces improves stepwise reasoning from\n4% to 11%, while training on final answers alone degrades performance to near\nzero.

To overcome this, we propose a two-stage curriculum learning\napproach: FontAdapter first learns to extract font attributes from isolated\nglyphs and then integrates these styles into diverse natural backgrounds. To\nsupport this two-stage training scheme, we construct synthetic datasets\ntailored to each stage, leveraging large-scale online fonts effectively.\nExperiments demonstrate that FontAdapter enables high-quality, robust font\ncustomization across unseen fonts without additional fine-tuning during\ninference. Furthermore, it supports visual text editing, font style blending,\nand cross-lingual font transfer, positioning FontAdapter as a versatile\nframework for font customization tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "FontAdapter\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5feb\u901f\u751f\u6210\u672a\u89c1\u5b57\u4f53\u89c6\u89c9\u6587\u672c\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u5b57\u4f53\u5b9a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u9884\u8bbe\u5b57\u5178\u5916\u7684\u5b57\u4f53\u9002\u5e94\u8017\u65f6\u4e14\u4e0d\u5b9e\u7528\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u5b9a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\uff1a\u5148\u63d0\u53d6\u5b57\u4f53\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u518d\u6574\u5408\u5230\u81ea\u7136\u80cc\u666f\u4e2d\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u652f\u6301\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "FontAdapter\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u5fae\u8c03\u5373\u53ef\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5b9a\u5236\u672a\u89c1\u5b57\u4f53\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u5b57\u4f53\u7f16\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "conclusion": "FontAdapter\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u591a\u529f\u80fd\u7684\u5b57\u4f53\u5b9a\u5236\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first interpretable algorithm specifically designed for\nclustering ensemble, offering a new perspective for future research in\ninterpretable clustering.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9996\u4e2a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u96c6\u6210\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u9886\u57df\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u805a\u7c7b\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u89c6\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5982\u533b\u7597\u548c\u91d1\u878d\uff09\u9700\u8981\u900f\u660e\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u57fa\u5206\u533a\u89c6\u4e3a\u5206\u7c7b\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u7edf\u8ba1\u5173\u8054\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6307\u5bfc\u6811\u6784\u5efa\u3002", "result": "\u6027\u80fd\u4e0eSOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5177\u5907\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9996\u6b21\u63d0\u51fa\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u805a\u7c7b\u96c6\u6210\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

The Skin Prick Automated Test (SPAT)\ndevice was designed for increased consistency in test results, and captures 32\nimages to be jointly used for allergy wheal detection and delineation, which\nleads to a diagnosis.\n  Materials and Methods: Using SPAT data from $868$ patients with suspected\ninhalant allergies, we designed an automated method to detect and delineate\nwheals on these images. To this end, $10,416$ wheals were manually annotated by\ndrawing detailed polygons along the edges. The unique data-modality of the SPAT\ndevice, with $32$ images taken under distinct lighting conditions, requires a\ncustom-made approach.

Based on these data, electricity\nsuppliers offer their clients energy monitoring solutions to provide feedback\non the consumption of their individual appliances. Historically, such estimates\nhave relied on statistical methods that use coarse-grained total monthly\nconsumption and static customer data, such as appliance ownership.\nNon-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is the problem of disaggregating a\nhousehold's collected total power consumption to retrieve the consumed power\nfor individual appliances. Current state-of-the-art (SotA) solutions for NILM\nare based on deep-learning (DL) and operate on subsequences of an entire\nhousehold consumption reading. However, the non-stationary nature of real-world\nsmart meter data leads to a drift in the data distribution within each\nsegmented window, which significantly affects model performance. This paper\nintroduces NILMFormer, a Transformer-based architecture that incorporates a new\nsubsequence stationarization/de-stationarization scheme to mitigate the\ndistribution drift and that uses a novel positional encoding that relies only\non the subsequence's timestamp information. Experiments with 4 real-world\ndatasets show that NILMFormer significantly outperforms the SotA approaches.\nOur solution has been deployed as the backbone algorithm for EDF's\n(Electricit\\'e De France) consumption monitoring service, delivering detailed\ninsights to millions of customers about their individual appliances' power\nconsumption.

This paper appeared in IEEE ICDE 2025", "summary": "Improving smart grid system management is crucial in the fight against\nclimate change, and enabling consumers to play an active role in this effort is\na significant challenge for electricity suppliers. In this regard, millions of\nsmart meters have been deployed worldwide in the last decade, recording the\nmain electricity power consumed in individual households. This data produces\nvaluable information that can help them reduce their electricity footprint;\nnevertheless, the collected signal aggregates the consumption of the different\nappliances running simultaneously in the house, making it difficult to\napprehend. Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) refers to the challenge of\nestimating the power consumption, pattern, or on/off state activation of\nindividual appliances using the main smart meter signal. Recent methods\nproposed to tackle this task are based on a fully supervised deep-learning\napproach that requires both the aggregate signal and the ground truth of\nindividual appliance power. However, such labels are expensive to collect and\nextremely scarce in practice, as they require conducting intrusive surveys in\nhouseholds to monitor each appliance. In this paper, we introduce CamAL, a\nweakly supervised approach for appliance pattern localization that only\nrequires information on the presence of an appliance in a household to be\ntrained. CamAL merges an ensemble of deep-learning classifiers combined with an\nexplainable classification method to be able to localize appliance patterns.\nOur experimental evaluation, conducted on 4 real-world datasets, demonstrates\nthat CamAL significantly outperforms existing weakly supervised baselines and\nthat current SotA fully supervised NILM approaches require significantly more\nlabels to reach CamAL performances.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach\nnamed Contextual-Semantic Consistency Learning (CSCL) to enhance the\nfine-grained perception ability of forgery for DGM4. Two branches for image and\ntext modalities are established, each of which contains two cascaded decoders,\ni.e., Contextual Consistency Decoder (CCD) and Semantic Consistency Decoder\n(SCD), to capture within-modality contextual consistency and across-modality\nsemantic consistency, respectively. Both CCD and SCD adhere to the same\ncriteria for capturing fine-grained forgery details. To be specific, each\nmodule first constructs consistency features by leveraging additional\nsupervision from the heterogeneous information of each token pair. Then, the\nforgery-aware reasoning or aggregating is adopted to deeply seek forgery cues\nbased on the consistency features.

In recent years, progress has been witnessed with the\nsuccess of utilizing transformer-like models, such as combining the attention\nmechanism with CNN. In particular, transformer-based segmentation models can\nextract global information more effectively, compensating for the drawbacks of\nCNN modules that focus on local features. However, utilizing transformer\narchitecture is not easy, because training transformer-based models can be\nresource-demanding. Moreover, due to the distinct characteristics in the\nmedical field, especially when encountering mid-sized and small organs with\ncompact regions, their results often seem unsatisfactory. For example, using\nViT to segment medical images directly only gives a DSC of less than 50\\%,\nwhich is far lower than the clinically acceptable score of 80\\%.

Recent studies have proposed\nvarious methods to address the out-of-distribution generalization challenge,\nwith many methods in the graph domain focusing on directly identifying an\ninvariant subgraph that is predictive of the target label. However, we argue\nthat identifying the edges from the invariant subgraph directly is challenging\nand error-prone, especially when some spurious edges exhibit strong\ncorrelations with the targets. In this paper, we propose PrunE, the first\npruning-based graph OOD method that eliminates spurious edges to improve OOD\ngeneralizability. By pruning spurious edges, \\mine{} retains the invariant\nsubgraph more comprehensively, which is critical for OOD generalization.\nSpecifically, PrunE employs two regularization terms to prune spurious edges:\n1) graph size constraint to exclude uninformative spurious edges, and 2)\n$\\epsilon$-probability alignment to further suppress the occurrence of spurious\nedges. Through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments, we show that\nPrunE achieves superior OOD performance and outperforms previous\nstate-of-the-art methods significantly.

Our approach achieves\nperformance that surpasses SBRL baselines across various benchmarks. These\nresults highlight the importance of explicitly harmonizing exploration and\ndiversity and demonstrate the effectiveness of AMPED in enabling robust and\ngeneralizable skill learning.

We develop a method to predict the composition\ndistribution in a multi-element combinatorial thin film, using in-situ\nmeasurements from quartz-crystal microbalance sensors placed in a sputter\nchamber. For a given source, the sensor readings are learned as a function of\nthe sputtering pressure and magnetron power, through active learning using\nGaussian processes (GPs). The final GPs are combined with a geometric model of\nthe deposition flux distribution in the chamber, which allows interpolation of\nthe deposition rates from each source, at any position across the sample. We\ninvestigate several acquisition functions for the ML procedure. A fully\nBayesian GP - BALM (Bayesian active learning MacKay) - achieved the best\nperformance, learning the deposition rates for a single source in 10\nexperiments.

But these MLLMs are good at analyzing short videos,\nwhile suffering from difficulties in understanding videos with a longer\ncontext. To address this difficulty, several agent paradigms have recently been\nproposed, using MLLMs as agents for retrieving extra contextual knowledge in a\nlong video. However, most existing agents ignore the key fact that a long video\nis composed with multiple shots, i.e., to answer the user question from a long\nvideo, it is critical to deeply understand its relevant shots like human.\nWithout such insight, these agents often mistakenly find redundant even noisy\ntemporal context, restricting their capacity for long video understanding. To\nfill this gap, we propose VideoChat-A1, a novel long video agent paradigm.\nDifferent from the previous works, our VideoChat-A1 can deeply think with long\nvideos, via a distinct chain-of-shot reasoning paradigm. More specifically, it\ncan progressively select the relevant shots of user question, and look into\nthese shots in a coarse-to-fine partition. By multi-modal reasoning along the\nshot chain, VideoChat-A1 can effectively mimic step-by-step human thinking\nprocess, allowing to interactively discover preferable temporal context for\nthoughtful understanding in long videos.

Retrieval systems typically treat\nthese modalities as independent retrieval sources, which can lead to noisy and\nsubpar retrieval. We explore multimodal video content retrieval, where\nrelevance can be scored from one particular modality or jointly across multiple\nmodalities simultaneously. Consequently, an effective retriever must\ndynamically choose which modality (or set of modalities) best addresses the\nquery. We introduce CLaMR, a multimodal, late-interaction retriever that\njointly indexes 4 modalities: video frames, transcribed speech, on-screen text,\nand metadata. CLaMR jointly encodes all modalities with a unified multimodal\nbackbone for improved contextualization and is trained to enhance dynamic\nmodality selection via two key innovations. First, given the lack of training\ndata for multimodal retrieval, we introduce MultiVENT 2.0++, a large-scale\nsynthetic training dataset built on MultiVENT 2.0 (event-centric videos in\nvarious languages paired with queries) with modality-targeted queries. Next, we\npropose a modality-aware loss that jointly trains according to a standard\ncontrastive objective alongside an objective for learning correct modality\nusage. On the test sets of MultiVENT 2.0++ and MSRVTT, conventional aggregation\nstrategies, such as averaging similarities for baseline retrievers, degrade\nperformance by introducing noise from irrelevant modalities.

It requires simultaneous capture of both phenological\ndynamics (obtained from multi-temporal satellite data like Sentinel-2) and\nsubtle spectral variations (demanding nanometer-scale spectral resolution from\nhyperspectral imagery). Research combining these two modalities remains scarce\ncurrently due to challenges in hyperspectral data acquisition and crop types\nannotation costs. To address these issues, we construct a hierarchical\nhyperspectral crop dataset (H2Crop) by integrating 30m-resolution EnMAP\nhyperspectral data with Sentinel-2 time series. With over one million annotated\nfield parcels organized in a four-tier crop taxonomy, H2Crop establishes a\nvital benchmark for fine-grained agricultural crop classification and\nhyperspectral image processing. We propose a dual-stream Transformer\narchitecture that synergistically processes these modalities. It coordinates\ntwo specialized pathways: a spectral-spatial Transformer extracts fine-grained\nsignatures from hyperspectral EnMAP data, while a temporal Swin Transformer\nextracts crop growth patterns from Sentinel-2 time series. The designed\nhierarchy classification heads with hierarchical fusion then simultaneously\ndelivers multi-level classification across all taxonomic tiers. Experiments\ndemonstrate that adding hyperspectral EnMAP data to Sentinel-2 time series\nyields a 4.2% average F1-scores improvement (peaking at 6.3%).

Recently, some researchers have turned to\nintegrating HGNNs with large language models (LLMs) for more generalizable\nheterogeneous graph learning. However, these approaches typically extract\nstructural information via HGNNs as HG tokens, and disparities in embedding\nspaces between HGNNs and LLMs have been shown to bias the LLM's comprehension\nof HGs. Moreover, as these HG tokens are often derived from node-level tasks,\nthe model's ability to generalize across tasks remains limited. To this end, we\npropose a simple yet effective Masked Language Modeling-based method, called\nMLM4HG. MLM4HG introduces metapath-based textual sequences instead of HG tokens\nto extract structural and semantic information inherent in HGs, and designs\ncustomized textual templates to unify different graph tasks into a coherent\ncloze-style \"mask\" token prediction paradigm. Specifically, MLM4HG first\nconverts HGs from various domains to texts based on metapaths, and subsequently\ncombines them with the unified task texts to form a HG-based corpus. Moreover,\nthe corpus is fed into a pretrained LM for fine-tuning with a constrained\ntarget vocabulary, enabling the fine-tuned LM to generalize to unseen target\nHGs. Extensive cross-domain and multi-task experiments on four real-world\ndatasets demonstrate the superior generalization performance of MLM4HG over\nstate-of-the-art methods in both few-shot and zero-shot scenarios.

The gold\nstandard definition of unlearning demands that the updated model, after\ndeletion, be nearly identical to the model obtained by retraining. This\ndefinition is designed for a worst-case attacker (one who can recover not only\nthe unlearned model but also the remaining data samples, i.e., $S \\setminus\nU$). Such a stringent definition has made developing efficient unlearning\nalgorithms challenging. However, such strong attackers are also unrealistic. In\nthis work, we propose a new definition, system-aware unlearning, which aims to\nprovide unlearning guarantees against an attacker that can at best only gain\naccess to the data stored in the system for learning/unlearning requests and\nnot all of $S\\setminus U$. With this new definition, we use the simple\nintuition that if a system can store less to make its learning/unlearning\nupdates, it can be more secure and update more efficiently against a\nsystem-aware attacker.

However, their\nwidespread use has raised significant concerns about the risk of training data\nprivacy leakage. This paper systematically investigates the privacy threats\nposed by membership inference attacks (MIAs) targeting encoder models, focusing\non contrastive learning frameworks. Through experimental analysis, we reveal\nthe significant impact of model architecture complexity on membership privacy\nleakage: As more advanced encoder frameworks improve feature-extraction\nperformance, they simultaneously exacerbate privacy-leakage risks. Furthermore,\nthis paper proposes a novel membership inference attack method based on the\np-norm of feature vectors, termed the Embedding Lp-Norm Likelihood Attack\n(LpLA). This method infers membership status, by leveraging the statistical\ndistribution characteristics of the p-norm of feature vectors. Experimental\nresults across multiple datasets and model architectures demonstrate that LpLA\noutperforms existing methods in attack performance and robustness, particularly\nunder limited attack knowledge and query volumes. This study not only uncovers\nthe potential risks of privacy leakage in contrastive learning frameworks, but\nalso provides a practical basis for privacy protection research in encoder\nmodels.

However, bridging this success to real-world applications\nremains a challenge. In practice, human search behavior is rarely a one-shot\naction. Instead, it is often a multi-round process guided by clues in mind,\nthat is, a mental image ranging from vague recollections to vivid mental\nrepresentations of the target image. Motivated by this gap, we study the task\nof Mental Image Retrieval (MIR), which targets the realistic yet underexplored\nsetting where users refine their search for a mentally envisioned image through\nmulti-round interactions with an image search engine. Central to successful\ninteractive retrieval is the capability of machines to provide users with\nclear, actionable feedback; however, existing methods rely on indirect or\nabstract verbal feedback, which can be ambiguous, misleading, or ineffective\nfor users to refine the query. To overcome this, we propose GenIR, a generative\nmulti-round retrieval paradigm leveraging diffusion-based image generation to\nexplicitly reify the AI system's understanding at each round.

We discovered that the key is to search for correlations in local\nregions and developed a new method, adjacent correlation analysis, to extract\nsuch correlations and represent them in phase space. When multiple observations\nare available, a useful way to study a system is to analyze distributions in\nphase space using the Probability Density Function (PDF). Adjacent correlation\nanalysis evaluates vectors representing local correlations, which can be\noverlaid on the PDF plot to form the adjacent correlation plot. These\ncorrelation vectors often exhibit remarkably regular patterns and may lead to\nthe discovery of new laws. The vectors we derive are equivalent to the vector\nfield in dynamical systems on the attracting manifold. By efficiently\nrepresenting spatial patterns as correlation vectors in phase space, our\napproach opens avenues for classification, prediction, parameter fitting, and\nforecasting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u201c\u76f8\u90bb\u76f8\u5173\u5206\u6790\u201d\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u53d6\u5c40\u90e8\u533a\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63ed\u793a\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e2d\u7684\u89c4\u5f8b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6d8c\u73b0\u662f\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0d\u5747\u5300\u6027\u4e0b\u5f80\u5f80\u5931\u6548\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u76f8\u90bb\u76f8\u5173\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u5c40\u90e8\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5e76\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6982\u7387\u5bc6\u5ea6\u51fd\u6570\uff08PDF\uff09\u5206\u6790\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u63ed\u793a\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5411\u91cf\u7684\u89c4\u5f8b\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u80fd\u53d1\u73b0\u65b0\u7684\u7269\u7406\u5b9a\u5f8b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u76f8\u90bb\u76f8\u5173\u5206\u6790\u4e3a\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u62df\u5408\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u80fd\u63a8\u52a8\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

Additionally, we introduce RoPE-DHR, a novel positional\nencoding mechanism that employs thumbnail-based positional aggregation to\nmaintain 2D spatial awareness while mitigating remote decay in extended\nsequences. Evaluations across seven benchmarks,including long-context\ncomprehension, multi-image reasoning, and visual question answering,\ndemonstrate CoMemo's superior performance compared to conventional LVLM\narchitectures.

We\nthen introduce the notion of conservation laws that depend only on a subset of\nparameters (corresponding e.g. to a pair of consecutive layers, to a residual\nblock, or to an attention layer). We demonstrate that the characterization of\nsuch laws can be reduced to the analysis of the corresponding building block in\nisolation.

At a high level,\neigenspectrum analysis of DNNs involves measuring the heavytailness of the\nempirical spectral densities (ESD) of weight matrices. It provides insight into\nhow well a model is trained and can guide decisions on assigning better\nlayer-wise training hyperparameters. In this paper, we address a challenge\nassociated with such eigenspectrum methods: the impact of the aspect ratio of\nweight matrices on estimated heavytailness metrics. We demonstrate that\nmatrices of varying sizes (and aspect ratios) introduce a non-negligible bias\nin estimating heavytailness metrics, leading to inaccurate model diagnosis and\nlayer-wise hyperparameter assignment. To overcome this challenge, we propose\nFARMS (Fixed-Aspect-Ratio Matrix Subsampling), a method that normalizes the\nweight matrices by subsampling submatrices with a fixed aspect ratio. Instead\nof measuring the heavytailness of the original ESD, we measure the average ESD\nof these subsampled submatrices. We show that measuring the heavytailness of\nthese submatrices with the fixed aspect ratio can effectively mitigate the\naspect ratio bias.

Buyers adopt $m$-uniform bidding format, where\nthey submit $m$ bid-quantity pairs $(b_i, q_i)$ to demand $q_i$ units at bid\n$b_i$. We introduce safe bidding strategies as those that satisfy RoI\nconstraints in every auction, regardless of competing bids. We show that these\nstrategies depend only on the valuation curve of the bidder, and the bidder can\nfocus on a finite subset of this class without loss of generality. While the\nnumber of strategies in this subset is exponential in $m$, we develop a\npolynomial-time algorithm to learn the optimal safe strategy that achieves\nsublinear regret in the online setting, where regret is measured against a\nclairvoyant benchmark that knows the competing bids a priori and selects a\nfixed hindsight optimal safe strategy. We then evaluate the performance of safe\nstrategies against a clairvoyant that selects the optimal strategy from a\nricher class of strategies in the online setting. In this scenario, we compute\nthe richness ratio, $\\alpha\\in(0, 1]$ for the class of strategies chosen by the\nclairvoyant and show that our algorithm, designed to learn safe strategies,\nachieves $\\alpha$-approximate sublinear regret against these stronger\nbenchmarks.

Thus,\nwe consider the problem of hierarchical clustering given auxiliary information\nfrom natural oracles. Specifically, we focus on a *splitting oracle* which,\nwhen provided with a triplet of vertices $(u,v,w)$, answers (possibly\nerroneously) the pairs of vertices whose lowest common ancestor includes all\nthree vertices in an optimal tree, i.e., identifying which vertex ``splits\naway'' from the others. Using such an oracle, we obtain the following results:\n  - A polynomial-time algorithm that outputs a hierarchical clustering tree\nwith $O(1)$-approximation to the Dasgupta objective (Dasgupta [STOC'16]).\n  - A near-linear time algorithm that outputs a hierarchical clustering tree\nwith $(1-o(1))$-approximation to the Moseley-Wang objective (Moseley and Wang\n[NeurIPS'17]).\n  Under the plausible Small Set Expansion Hypothesis, no polynomial-time\nalgorithm can achieve any constant approximation for Dasgupta's objective or\n$(1-C)$-approximation for the Moseley-Wang objective for some constant $C>0$.\nAs such, our results demonstrate that the splitting oracle enables algorithms\nto outperform standard HC approaches and overcome hardness constraints.\nFurthermore, our approaches extend to sublinear settings, in which we show new\nstreaming and PRAM algorithms for HC with improved guarantees.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u5206\u88c2\u9884\u8a00\u673a\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u805a\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u8fd1\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9Dasgupta\u548cMoseley-Wang\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5c42\u6b21\u805a\u7c7b\u76ee\u6807\u5b58\u5728\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u786c\u6027\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u8f85\u52a9\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u5982\u5206\u88c2\u9884\u8a00\u673a\uff09\u6765\u514b\u670d\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5206\u88c2\u9884\u8a00\u673a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56de\u7b54\u9876\u70b9\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u7684\u5206\u88c2\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u8fd1\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9Dasgupta\u76ee\u6807\u7684O(1)\u8fd1\u4f3c\u548c\u5bf9Moseley-Wang\u76ee\u6807\u7684(1-o(1))\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5206\u88c2\u9884\u8a00\u673a\u80fd\u591f\u5e2e\u52a9\u7b97\u6cd5\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edf\u5c42\u6b21\u805a\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u786c\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5e76\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b50\u7ebf\u6027\u8bbe\u7f6e\u3002"}}

We prove\nlinear convergence of the policy gradient steps to best-response policies and\nestablish global convergence of the overall algorithm to the Nash equilibrium.\nThe analysis relies on novel landscape characterizations over\ninfinite-dimensional policy spaces.

For this\nhierarchy, we prove fast convergence provided the Markov chain mixes rapidly.\nBoth hierarchies lead to an $\\varepsilon$-approximation for local expectation\nvalues using a linear program of size quasi-polynomial in $n/\\varepsilon$,\nwhere $n$ is the total number of sites, provided the interactions can be\nembedded in a $d$-dimensional grid with constant $d$. Compared to standard\nMonte Carlo methods, an advantage of this approach is that it always (i.e., for\nany system) outputs rigorous upper and lower bounds on the expectation value of\ninterest, without needing an a priori analysis of the convergence speed.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u81ea\u65cb\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684Gibbs\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u8ba1\u7b97\u5c40\u90e8\u51fd\u6570\u671f\u671b\u503c\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u6536\u655b\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5728Gibbs\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u8ba1\u7b97\u5c40\u90e8\u51fd\u6570\u671f\u671b\u503c\u7684\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7f51\u683c\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c40\u90e8\u81ea\u65cb\u7ffb\u8f6c\u7b49\u5f0f\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u94fe\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u6df7\u5408\u6761\u4ef6\u6216\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u94fe\u5feb\u901f\u6df7\u5408\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e24\u79cd\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u5747\u80fd\u5feb\u901f\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u754c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u671f\u671b\u503c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u3002"}}

Despite clear biological\ninterpretation, successful application in several domains, and experimental\nvalidation, a formal complete convergence analysis remains elusive. Building on\nthis framework, we consider and analyze a continuous-time neural network, the\n\\emph{similarity matching network}, for principal subspace projection. Derived\nfrom a min-max-min objective, this biologically-plausible network consists of\nthree coupled dynamics evolving at different time scales: neural dynamics,\nlateral synaptic dynamics, and feedforward synaptic dynamics at the fast,\nintermediate, and slow time scales, respectively. The feedforward and lateral\nsynaptic dynamics consist of Hebbian and anti-Hebbian learning rules,\nrespectively. By leveraging a multilevel optimization framework, we prove\nconvergence of the dynamics in the offline setting. Specifically, at the first\nlevel (fast time scale), we show strong convexity of the cost function and\nglobal exponential convergence of the corresponding gradient-flow dynamics. At\nthe second level (intermediate time scale), we prove strong concavity of the\ncost function and exponential convergence of the corresponding gradient-flow\ndynamics within the space of positive definite matrices. At the third and final\nlevel (slow time scale), we study a non-convex and non-smooth cost function,\nprovide explicit expressions for its global minima, and prove almost sure\nconvergence of the corresponding gradient-flow dynamics to the global minima.\nThese results rely on two empirically motivated conjectures that are supported\nby thorough numerical experiments.

Despite current advancements in reinforcement fine-tuning\n(RFT) showing strong performance in enhancing reasoning in LLMs, its potential\nto enable self-evolving embodied intelligence with multi-modal interactions\nremains largely unexplored. Specifically, reinforcement fine-tuning faces two\nfundamental obstacles in embodied settings: (i) the lack of accessible\nintermediate rewards in multi-step reasoning tasks limits effective learning\nsignals, and (ii) reliance on hand-crafted reward functions restricts\ngeneralization to novel tasks and environments. To address these challenges, we\npresent Self-Evolving Embodied Agents-R1, SEEA-R1, the first RFT framework\ndesigned for enabling the self-evolving capabilities of embodied agents.\nSpecifically, to convert sparse delayed rewards into denser intermediate\nsignals that improve multi-step reasoning, we propose Tree-based group relative\npolicy optimization (Tree-GRPO), which integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search into\nGRPO. To generalize reward estimation across tasks and scenes, supporting\nautonomous adaptation and reward-driven self-evolution, we further introduce\nMulti-modal Generative Reward Model (MGRM). To holistically evaluate the\neffectiveness of SEEA-R1, we evaluate on the ALFWorld benchmark, surpassing\nstate-of-the-art methods with scores of 85.07% (textual) and 36.19%\n(multi-modal), outperforming prior models including GPT-4o. SEEA-R1 also\nachieves scores of 80.3% without environmental reward, surpassing all\nopen-source baselines and highlighting its scalability as a self-evolving\nembodied agent.

For instance, in brachytherapy, clinicians must\nbalance maximizing tumor coverage (e.g., an aspirational target or soft bound\nof >95% coverage) against strict organ dose limits (e.g., a non-negotiable hard\nbound of <601 cGy to the bladder), with each plan evaluation being\nresource-intensive. Selecting Pareto-optimal solutions that match implicit\npreferences is challenging, as exhaustive Pareto frontier exploration is\ncomputationally and cognitively prohibitive, necessitating interactive\nframeworks to guide users. While decision-makers (DMs) often possess domain\nknowledge to narrow the search via such soft-hard bounds, current methods often\nlack systematic approaches to iteratively refine these multi-faceted preference\nstructures. Critically, DMs must trust their final decision, confident they\nhaven't missed superior alternatives; this trust is paramount in\nhigh-consequence scenarios. We present Active-MoSH, an interactive local-global\nframework designed for this process. Its local component integrates soft-hard\nbounds with probabilistic preference learning, maintaining distributions over\nDM preferences and bounds for adaptive Pareto subset refinement. This is guided\nby an active sampling strategy optimizing exploration-exploitation while\nminimizing cognitive burden.

This simplified model enables uncluttered mathematical analysis,\nrevealing two key properties: root value distributions asymptotically collapse\nto a single fixed value for finite-valued trees, and all reasonable algorithms\nachieve global optimality. However, these findings are artifacts of the model's\ndesign-its long criticized independence assumption strips games of structural\ncomplexity, producing trivial instances where no algorithm faces meaningful\nchallenges. To address this limitation, we introduce a new probabilistic model\nthat incrementally constructs game-trees using a fixed level-wise conditional\ndistribution. By enforcing ancestor dependency, a critical structural feature\nof real-world games, our framework generates problems with adjustable\ndifficulty while retaining some form of analytical tractability. For several\nalgorithms, including AlphaBeta and Scout, we derive recursive formulas\ncharacterizing their average-case complexities under this model.

Although such models can\ngenerate high-quality data points from a noise distribution, the sampling\ndemands multiple iterations to solve an ordinary differential equation (ODE)\nwith high computational complexity.

We achieve this by rewiring the blocks in the\ntransformer-based architecture to solve an inner discretized ODE w.r.t. its\nlength.

CNNs are effective at capturing spatial\nartifacts, and Transformers excel at modeling temporal inconsistencies.\nHowever, many existing CNN-Transformer models process spatial and temporal\nfeatures independently. In particular, attention-based methods often use\nseparate attention mechanisms for spatial and temporal features and combine\nthem using naive approaches like averaging, addition, or concatenation, which\nlimits the depth of spatio-temporal interaction. To address this challenge, we\npropose a unified CAST model that leverages cross-attention to effectively fuse\nspatial and temporal features in a more integrated manner. Our approach allows\ntemporal features to dynamically attend to relevant spatial regions, enhancing\nthe model's ability to detect fine-grained, time-evolving artifacts such as\nflickering eyes or warped lips. This design enables more precise localization\nand deeper contextual understanding, leading to improved performance across\ndiverse and challenging scenarios. We evaluate the performance of our model\nusing the FaceForensics++, Celeb-DF, and DeepfakeDetection datasets in both\nintra- and cross-dataset settings to affirm the superiority of our approach.\nOur model achieves strong performance with an AUC of 99.49 percent and an\naccuracy of 97.57 percent in intra-dataset evaluations.

Existing approaches primarily focus on optimizing\nnetwork architecture and diffusion paths but overlook the integration of the\ndiffusion training paradigm within general ordinary IR frameworks. To address\nthese challenges, this paper elucidates key principles for adapting the\ndiffusion training paradigm to general IR training through systematic analysis\nof time-step dependencies, network hierarchies, noise-level relationships, and\nmulti-restoration task correlations, proposing a new IR framework supported by\ndiffusion-based training.

Although autoregressive systems\nexhibit certain advantages in speech naturalness, their token-by-token\ngeneration mechanism makes it difficult to precisely control the duration of\nsynthesized speech. This is a key limitation in applications such as video\ndubbing that require strict audio-visual synchronization. This paper introduces\nIndexTTS2, which proposes a novel and autoregressive-model-friendly method for\nspeech duration control. The method supports two generation modes: one allows\nexplicit specification of the number of generated tokens for precise duration\ncontrol; the other does not require manual input and lets the model freely\ngenerate speech while preserving prosodic characteristics from the input\nprompt. Furthermore, IndexTTS2 achieves disentanglement between emotional\nexpression and speaker identity, enabling independent control of timbre and\nemotion. In the zero-shot setting, the model can perfectly reproduce the\nemotional characteristics of the input prompt. Users may also provide a\nseparate emotion prompt, even from a different speaker, allowing the model to\nreconstruct the target timbre while conveying the desired emotion. To enhance\nclarity during strong emotional expressions, we incorporate GPT latent\nrepresentations to improve speech stability. Meanwhile, to lower the barrier\nfor emotion control, we design a soft instruction mechanism based on textual\ndescriptions by fine-tuning Qwen3.

We present techniques to model\nthe user-specific mapping of latency level to scaling factor for optimal\nperformance, leading to an efficient and effective solution to optimizing\nperformance of robotic teleoperation and specifically telesurgery under large\ncommunication delay.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5728\u8fdc\u7a0b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u8fd0\u52a8\u7f29\u653e\u56e0\u5b50\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u9ad8\u5ef6\u8fdf\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6700\u4f73\u7f29\u653e\u56e0\u5b50\u56e0\u7528\u6237\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6c34\u5e73\u800c\u5f02\uff0c\u9700\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fdc\u7a0b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\uff0c\u7f51\u7edc\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5bfc\u81f4\u547d\u4ee4\u548c\u53cd\u9988\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u627e\u5230\u6700\u4f73\u8fd0\u52a8\u7f29\u653e\u56e0\u5b50\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u7f29\u653e\u56e0\u5b50\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5efa\u6a21\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u6700\u4f73\u7f29\u653e\u56e0\u5b50\u56e0\u7528\u6237\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6c34\u5e73\u800c\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5efa\u6a21\u662f\u4f18\u5316\u8fdc\u7a0b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8fdc\u7a0b\u624b\u672f\u7b49\u9ad8\u5ef6\u8fdf\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

However, the\ndata ecosystems of these three key areas are increasingly fragmented and\nincompatible. Especially, existing testing methods rely on data stacking, fail\nto cover all edge cases, and lack flexibility. To address this issue, this\npaper introduces the concept of \"Query as Test\" (QaT). This concept shifts the\nfocus from rigid, prescripted test cases to flexible, on-demand logical queries\nagainst a unified data representation. Specifically, we identify the need for a\nfundamental improvement in data storage and representation, leading to our\nproposal of \"Extensible Scenarios Notations\" (ESN). ESN is a novel declarative\ndata framework based on Answer Set Programming (ASP), which uniformly\nrepresents heterogeneous multimodal data from the cockpit, vehicle, and road as\na collection of logical facts and rules. This approach not only achieves deep\nsemantic fusion of data, but also brings three core advantages: (1) supports\ncomplex and flexible semantic querying through logical reasoning; (2) provides\nnatural interpretability for decision-making processes; (3) allows for\non-demand data abstraction through logical rules, enabling fine-grained privacy\nprotection. We further elaborate on the QaT paradigm, transforming the\nfunctional validation and safety compliance checks of autonomous driving\nsystems into logical queries against the ESN database, significantly enhancing\nthe expressiveness and formal rigor of the testing.

However, current benchmarks overwhelmingly\nfocus on questions answerable through explicit visual content - actions,\nobjects & events directly observable within individual frames or short clips.\nIn contrast, creative and cinematic videos - such as movies, TV shows, and\nnarrative-driven content - employ storytelling techniques that deliberately\nomit certain depictions, requiring viewers to infer motives, causality, and\nrelationships across discontinuous frames. Humans naturally excel at such\nimplicit reasoning, seamlessly integrating information across time and context\nto construct coherent narratives. Current VideoQA systems and benchmarks fail\nto capture this essential dimension of human-like understanding. To bridge this\ngap, we present ImplicitQA, a novel benchmark specifically designed to test\nmodels on implicit reasoning. It comprises 1K meticulously annotated QA pairs\nderived from 320+ high-quality creative video clips, systematically categorized\ninto key reasoning dimensions: lateral and vertical spatial reasoning, depth\nand proximity, viewpoint and visibility, motion and trajectory, causal and\nmotivational reasoning, social interactions, physical context, and inferred\ncounting. These annotations are deliberately challenging, crafted by authors\nensuring high-quality. Our extensive evaluations on leading VideoQA models\nreveals performance degradation, underscoring their reliance on surface-level\nvisual cues and highlighting the difficulty of implicit reasoning.

It introduces a scale of AI agency levels and uses\nrepresentative examples to highlight the importance and growing necessity of\ntreating AI autonomy as an independent research focus in cooperative settings.\nThe paper then explores how intelligent disobedience manifests across different\nautonomy levels and concludes by proposing initial boundaries and\nconsiderations for studying disobedience as a core capability of artificial\nagents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u4e3b\u5f20\u8d4b\u4e88AI\u961f\u53cb\u667a\u80fd\u8fdd\u6297\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u5728\u4eba\u7c7b-AI\u56e2\u961f\u4e2d\u80fd\u81ea\u4e3b\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u81ea\u4e3b\u7ea7\u522b\u4e0b\u8fdd\u6297\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5408\u4f5c\u578bAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u5e38\u76f2\u76ee\u670d\u4ece\u4eba\u7c7b\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u6548\u7387\u6216\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76AI\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u8fdd\u6297\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAI\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u7ea7\u522b\u91cf\u8868\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u6848\u4f8b\u8bf4\u660e\u667a\u80fd\u8fdd\u6297\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5c06AI\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u4f5c\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u521d\u6b65\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u8fdd\u6297\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5f62\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u8bae\u5c06\u8fdd\u6297\u80fd\u529b\u4f5c\u4e3aAI\u6838\u5fc3\u80fd\u529b\u8fdb\u884c\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u521d\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u8fb9\u754c\u548c\u8003\u8651\u56e0\u7d20\u3002"}}

This work presents\na comprehensive theoretical and empirical comparison of BP, FmAD, and ZO\nmethods. Our theoretical analysis shows that while FmAD, and ZO can reduce\nmemory usage, they incur significant costs in accuracy, convergence speed, and\ncomputation compared to BP with checkpointing. These drawbacks worsen with\nlarger models or constrained perturbation budgets. Empirical experiments on\nlarge language and vision-language models show that BP with checkpointing\noutperforms FmAD and ZO variants, including those enhanced with variance\nreduction, achieving up to 31.1% higher accuracy, 34.8% faster convergence, and\n3.8x fewer computations at comparable memory usage.

They also fail to\nprovide a unique, verifiable identity for AI models to ensure their provenance\nand authenticity across systems and use cases, limiting reproducibility and\nstakeholder trust. This paper introduces the concept of the AI Model Passport,\na structured and standardized documentation framework that acts as a digital\nidentity and verification tool for AI models. It captures essential metadata to\nuniquely identify, verify, trace and monitor AI models across their lifecycle -\nfrom data acquisition and preprocessing to model design, development and\ndeployment. In addition, an implementation of this framework is presented\nthrough AIPassport, an MLOps tool developed within the ProCAncer-I EU project\nfor medical imaging applications. AIPassport automates metadata collection,\nensures proper versioning, decouples results from source scripts, and\nintegrates with various development environments. Its effectiveness is\nshowcased through a lesion segmentation use case using data from the\nProCAncer-I dataset, illustrating how the AI Model Passport enhances\ntransparency, reproducibility, and regulatory readiness while reducing manual\neffort. This approach aims to set a new standard for fostering trust and\naccountability in AI-driven healthcare solutions, aspiring to serve as the\nbasis for developing transparent and regulation compliant AI systems across\ndomains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faAI Model Passport\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u6587\u6863\u548c\u5de5\u5177AIPassport\u589e\u5f3aAI\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u3001\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u6027\u548c\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709AI\u6846\u67b6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u673a\u5668\u53ef\u8bfb\u6027\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u552f\u4e00\u6027\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u548c\u4fe1\u4efb\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165AI Model Passport\u6846\u67b6\u53ca\u5176\u5b9e\u65bd\u5de5\u5177AIPassport\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5143\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u548c\u7248\u672c\u7ba1\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u3001\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u548c\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "AI Model Passport\u4e3aAI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u533b\u7597\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\u548c\u95ee\u8d23\u6807\u51c6\u3002"}}

However, few works have paid attention to the error-bias with\nrespect to error distribution of facial landmarks. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the error-bias issue in face alignment, where the distributions of\nlandmark errors tend to spread along the tangent line to landmark curves. This\nerror-bias is not trivial since it is closely connected to the ambiguous\nlandmark labeling task. Inspired by this observation, we seek a way to leverage\nthe error-bias property for better convergence of CNN model.

Integrating cover crops (CC) offers multiple benefits, including soil\nerosion reduction, weed suppression, decreased nitrogen requirements, and\nenhanced carbon sequestration, all of which are closely tied to the aboveground\nbiomass (AGB) they produce. However, biomass production varies significantly\ndue to microsite variability, making accurate estimation and mapping essential\nfor identifying zones of poor weed suppression and optimizing targeted\nmanagement strategies. To address this challenge, developing a comprehensive CC\nmap, including its AGB distribution, will enable informed decision-making\nregarding weed control methods and optimal application rates. Manual visual\ninspection is impractical and labor-intensive, especially given the extensive\nfield size and the wide diversity and variation of weed species and sizes. In\nthis context, optical imagery and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data are\ntwo prominent sources with unique characteristics that enhance AGB estimation.\nThis study introduces a ground robot-mounted multimodal sensor system designed\nfor agricultural field mapping. The system integrates optical and LiDAR data,\nleveraging machine learning (ML) methods for data fusion to improve biomass\npredictions. The best ML-based model for dry AGB estimation achieved a\ncoefficient of determination value of 0.88, demonstrating robust performance in\ndiverse field conditions.

To improve the automation of these bidding\nsystems, we adopt generative models, namely the Decision Transformer (DT), to\ntackle the difficulties inherent in automated bidding. Applying the Decision\nTransformer to the auto-bidding task enables a unified approach to sequential\nmodeling, which efficiently overcomes short-sightedness by capturing long-term\ndependencies between past bidding actions and user behavior. Nevertheless,\nconventional DT has certain drawbacks: (1) DT necessitates a preset\nreturn-to-go (RTG) value before generating actions, which is not inherently\nproduced; (2) The policy learned by DT is restricted by its training data,\nwhich is consists of mixed-quality trajectories. To address these challenges,\nwe introduce the R* Decision Transformer (R* DT), developed in a three-step\nprocess: (1) R DT: Similar to traditional DT, R DT stores actions based on\nstate and RTG value, as well as memorizing the RTG for a given state using the\ntraining set; (2) R^ DT: We forecast the highest value (within the training\nset) of RTG for a given state, deriving a suboptimal policy based on the\ncurrent state and the forecasted supreme RTG value; (3) R* DT: Based on R^ DT,\nwe generate trajectories and select those with high rewards (using a simulator)\nto augment our training dataset. This data enhancement has been shown to\nimprove the RTG of trajectories in the training data and gradually leads the\nsuboptimal policy towards optimality.

Recent research\nhas been dedicated to data efficiency, which aims to maximize performance by\nselecting a minimal or optimal subset of training data. Techniques such as data\nfiltering, sampling, and selection play a crucial role in this area. To\ncomplement it, we define Data Efficacy, which focuses on maximizing performance\nby optimizing the organization of training data and remains relatively\nunderexplored. This work introduces a general paradigm, DELT, for considering\ndata efficacy in LM training, which highlights the significance of training\ndata organization. DELT comprises three components: Data Scoring, Data\nSelection, and Data Ordering. Among these components, we design\nLearnability-Quality Scoring (LQS), as a new instance of Data Scoring, which\nconsiders both the learnability and quality of each data sample from the\ngradient consistency perspective. We also devise Folding Ordering (FO), as a\nnovel instance of Data Ordering, which addresses issues such as model\nforgetting and data distribution bias.

Two new conditional\nprobability distributions are developed for the new binned semiparametric\nBayesian networks, the sparse binned kernel density estimation and the Fourier\nkernel density estimation. These two probability distributions address the\ncurse of dimensionality, which typically impacts binned models, by using sparse\ntensors and restricting the number of parent nodes in conditional probability\ncalculations. To evaluate the proposal, we perform a complexity analysis and\nconduct several comparative experiments using synthetic data and datasets from\nthe UCI Machine Learning repository.

However, their\napplication to remote sensing (RS) remains underexplored due to significant\ndomain differences in visual appearances, object scales, and semantics. These\ndiscrepancies hider the effective understanding of RS scenes, which contain\nrich, multi-level semantic information spanning from coarse-to-fine levels.\nHence, it limits the direct adaptation of existing LVLMs to RS imagery. To\naddress this gap, we propose a novel LVLM framework tailored for RS\nunderstanding, incorporating two core components: Semantic-augmented\nMulti-level Alignment and Semantic-aware Expert Modeling. First, to align\nmulti-level visual features, we introduce the retrieval-based Semantic\nAugmentation Module which enriches the visual features with relevant semantics\nacross fine-to-coarse levels (e.g., object- and scene-level information). It is\ndesigned to retrieve relevant semantic cues from a RS semantic knowledge\ndatabase, followed by aggregation of semantic cues with user query and\nmulti-level visual features, resulting in semantically enriched representation\nacross multiple levels. Second, for Semantic-aware Expert Modeling, we design\nsemantic experts, where each expert is responsible for processing semantic\nrepresentation at different levels separately.

UniCA is compatible and universal for\nadaptation with both homogeneous and heterogeneous covariates, incorporating\nextra covariate information while preserving the generalization ability of\nTSFMs.Extensive experiments on multiple unimodal and multimodal covariate-aware\nforecasting benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of UniCA, highlighting the\npromise of covariate-aware TSFM adaptation in real-world forecasting scenarios.\nCodes are released on https://github.com/hanlu-nju/UniCA.", "AI": {"tldr": "UniCA\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u540c\u8d28\u5316\u548c\u7edf\u4e00\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08TSFMs\uff09\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5f02\u6784\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "TSFMs\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u5b9e\u503c\u5e8f\u5217\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u5f02\u6784\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\uff08\u5982\u5206\u7c7b\u53d8\u91cf\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\uff09\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u901a\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "UniCA\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u540c\u8d28\u5316\u5c06\u5f02\u6784\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u540c\u8d28\u5e8f\u5217\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u878d\u5408\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cUniCA\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "UniCA\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u611f\u77e5\u7684TSFM\u9002\u5e94\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u9884\u6d4b\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

A major factor is\nthat accurate automatic detection of visual elements in a lecture video is\nchallenging; reasons include i) most visual elements, such as charts, graphs,\ntables, and illustrations, are artificially created and lack any standard\nstructure, and ii) coherent visual objects may lack clear boundaries and may be\ncomposed of connected text and visual components. Despite advancements in deep\nlearning based object detection, current models do not yield satisfactory\nperformance due to the unique nature of visual content in lectures and scarcity\nof annotated datasets. This paper reports on a transfer learning approach for\ndetecting visual elements in lecture video frames. A suite of state of the art\nobject detection models were evaluated for their performance on lecture video\ndatasets. YOLO emerged as the most promising model for this task. Subsequently\nYOLO was optimized for lecture video object detection with training on multiple\nbenchmark datasets and deploying a semi-supervised auto labeling strategy.\nResults evaluate the success of this approach, also in developing a general\nsolution to the problem of object detection in lecture videos. Paper\ncontributions include a publicly released benchmark of annotated lecture video\nframes, along with the source code to facilitate future research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u6559\u5b66\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u5143\u7d20\uff08\u5982\u56fe\u8868\u3001\u8868\u683c\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u4e86YOLO\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u6559\u5b66\u89c6\u9891\u5185\u5bb9\u65f6\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u6559\u5b66\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u5143\u7d20\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u81ea\u52a8\u68c0\u6d4b\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6807\u51c6\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6e05\u6670\u8fb9\u754c\u800c\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u9009\u62e9\u5e76\u4f18\u5316YOLO\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u81ea\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "YOLO\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u540e\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u8fd8\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6559\u5b66\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u89c6\u89c9\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Benchmarked alongside\nkey representatives of classic methods, we confirm the generally superior\nperformance of RDL while providing insights into the main factors shaping\nperformance, including model complexity, database sizes and their structural\nproperties.", "AI": {"tldr": "REDELEX\u6846\u67b6\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684RDL\u6a21\u578b\u572870\u591a\u4e2aRDB\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0RDL\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5f71\u54cd\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76RDL\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u5e95\u5c42RDB\u7279\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u65b0\u5174\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5206\u6790\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faREDELEX\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u79cd\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684RDL\u6a21\u578b\u572870\u591a\u4e2aRDB\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "RDL\u6027\u80fd\u666e\u904d\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u6a21\u578b\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3001\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "REDELEX\u4e3aRDL\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f71\u54cd\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Traditional sequential recommenders predominantly rely\non ID-based embeddings, which capture CF signals through high-order\nco-occurrence patterns. However, these embeddings depend solely on past\ninteractions, lacking transferable knowledge to generalize to unseen domains.\nRecent advances in large language models (LLMs) have motivated text-based\nrecommendation approaches that derive item representations from textual\ndescriptions. While these methods enhance generalization, they fail to encode\nCF signals-i.e., latent item correlations and preference patterns-crucial for\neffective recommendation. We argue that an ideal embedding model should\nseamlessly integrate CF signals with rich semantic representations to improve\nboth in-domain and out-of-domain recommendation performance.\n  To this end, we propose LLM2Rec, a novel embedding model tailored for\nsequential recommendation, integrating the rich semantic understanding of LLMs\nwith CF awareness. Our approach follows a two-stage training framework: (1)\nCollaborative Supervised Fine-tuning, which adapts LLMs to infer item\nrelationships based on historical interactions, and (2) Item-level Embedding\nModeling, which refines these specialized LLMs into structured item embedding\nmodels that encode both semantic and collaborative information. Extensive\nexperiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that LLM2Rec effectively\nimproves recommendation quality across both in-domain and out-of-domain\nsettings.

This creates misleading assessments that\ninfluence deployment decisions in specialized domains. We show that two\nbenchmarks with drastically different features such as topic diversity,\nboundary overlap, and semantic complexity can influence the perceived benefits\nof fine-tuning. Using environmental regulatory document retrieval as a case\nstudy, we fine-tune ColBERTv2 model on Environmental Impact Statements (EIS)\nfrom federal agencies. We evaluate these models across two benchmarks with\ndifferent semantic structures. Our findings reveal that identical domain\nadaptation approaches show very different perceived benefits depending on\nevaluation methodology. On one benchmark, with clearly separated topic\nboundaries, domain adaptation shows small improvements (maximum 0.61% NDCG\ngain). However, on the other benchmark with overlapping semantic structures,\nthe same models demonstrate large improvements (up to 2.22% NDCG gain), a\n3.6-fold difference in the performance benefit. We compare these benchmarks\nthrough topic diversity metrics, finding that the higher-performing benchmark\nshows 11% higher average cosine distances between contexts and 23% lower\nsilhouette scores, directly contributing to the observed performance\ndifference.

However,\nexisting research largely overlooks a thorough and systematic comparison of\nthese models' reasoning processes and outputs, particularly regarding their\nself-reflection pattern (also termed \"Aha moment\") and the interconnections\nacross diverse domains. This paper proposes a novel framework for analyzing the\nreasoning characteristics of four cutting-edge large reasoning models (GPT-o1,\nDeepSeek-R1, Kimi-k1.5, and Grok-3) using keywords statistic and LLM-as-a-judge\nparadigm. Our approach connects their internal thinking processes with their\nfinal outputs. A diverse dataset consists of real-world scenario-based\nquestions covering logical deduction, causal inference, and multi-step\nproblem-solving. Additionally, a set of metrics is put forward to assess both\nthe coherence of reasoning and the accuracy of the outputs. The research\nresults uncover various patterns of how these models balance exploration and\nexploitation, deal with problems, and reach conclusions during the reasoning\nprocess. Through quantitative and qualitative comparisons, disparities among\nthese models are identified in aspects such as the depth of reasoning, the\nreliance on intermediate steps, and the degree of similarity between their\nthinking processes and output patterns and those of GPT-o1.

However, it\nremains unclear whether and under what conditions such multimodal integration\nconsistently yields gains. We systematically investigate these questions across\na diverse benchmark of 14 forecasting tasks spanning 7 domains, including\nhealth, environment, and economics. We evaluate two popular multimodal\nforecasting paradigms: aligning-based methods, which align time series and text\nrepresentations; and prompting-based methods, which directly prompt large\nlanguage models for forecasting. Although prior works report gains from\nmultimodal input, we find these effects are not universal across datasets and\nmodels, and multimodal methods sometimes do not outperform the strongest\nunimodal baselines.

Our\ncomprehensive experiments comparing with a variety of both CFL and generic\nPersonalized Federated Learning (PFL) algorithms on different types of datasets\nand an extensive array of non-IID settings demonstrate that CLoVE achieves\nhighly accurate cluster recovery in just a few rounds of training, along with\nstate-of-the-art model accuracy, across a variety of both supervised and\nunsupervised PFL tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "CLoVE\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u635f\u5931\u5411\u91cf\u5d4c\u5165\u8bc6\u522b\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u96c6\u7fa4\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6700\u4f18\u521d\u59cb\u5316\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u805a\u7c7b\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u96c6\u7fa4\u8bc6\u522b\u56f0\u96be\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u635f\u5931\u503c\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u533a\u5206\u4e0d\u540c\u96c6\u7fa4\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7684\u635f\u5931\u5411\u91cf\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u8fed\u4ee3\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u5206\u79bb\u4e0d\u540c\u96c6\u7fa4\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u90a6\u805a\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u96c6\u7fa4\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660eCLoVE\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u6062\u590d\u96c6\u7fa4\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u5728\u5c11\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f6e\u6b21\u5185\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u96c6\u7fa4\u6062\u590d\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "CLoVE\u7b80\u5355\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Finally, to showcase the utility of the OPC, we\nfinetune an 8B-parameter model on the dataset, obtaining a model that performs\non par with the best model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, on the task of evaluating proof\ncorrectness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86Open Proof Corpus (OPC)\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b5000\u591a\u6761\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684LLM\u751f\u6210\u8bc1\u660e\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63a8\u52a8\u6570\u5b66\u8bc1\u660e\u751f\u6210\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u8fdb\u6b65\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684LLM\u751f\u6210\u8bc1\u660e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u6570\u5b66\u8bc1\u660e\u751f\u6210\u9886\u57df\u7684\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86OPC\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b5000\u591a\u6761\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684LLM\u751f\u6210\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8bc1\u660e\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528OPC\u5fae\u8c03\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a8B\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4e0eGemini-2.5-Pro\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "OPC\u4e3a\u6570\u5b66\u8bc1\u660e\u751f\u6210\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Specifically, our method improves GPT-4o visual search accuracy by\n25.00%, increases counting accuracy by 26.83%, reduces edit distance error in\nscene description by 0.32, and enhances performance on spatial relationship\ntasks by 9.50% on a a 2D synthetic dataset.

SSL has allowed the development of foundation\nmodels (FMs), large models that can be used for a variety of downstream tasks.\nHowever, existing FMs for OCT, trained solely on image data, lack a\ncomprehensive and robust semantic understanding of images, as evidenced by\ntheir downstream performance (especially for complex tasks), and thus require\nsupervised fine-tuning (which may be unfeasible) to better adapt to specific\napplications and populations. To address this, we propose RetFiner, an SSL\nvision-language refinement scheme that improves the representations of existing\nFMs and enables their efficient and direct adaptation to specific populations\nfor improved downstream performance. Our method uses a diverse set of training\nobjectives which take advantage of the rich supervisory signal found in textual\ndata.

Evaluations on the benchmarks\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, validating that\nfrequency-enhanced semantic features enable robust differentiation of visually\nand semantically similar action clusters, improving zero-shot action\nrecognition.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9891\u7387\u5206\u89e3\u7684FS-VAE\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u9aa8\u67b6\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9891\u7387\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u89c6\u8bed\u4e49\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "FS-VAE\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6a21\u5757\uff1a\u9891\u7387\u589e\u5f3a\u3001\u591a\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u6821\u51c6\u4ea4\u53c9\u5bf9\u9f50\u635f\u5931\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u9891\u7387\u589e\u5f3a\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u533a\u5206\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u7c07\u3002", "conclusion": "FS-VAE\u901a\u8fc7\u9891\u7387\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

We systematically analyze synonym groups for\nwidely discussed 'spiking words' based on frequency trends in scientific\nabstracts from PubMed. We find that entire semantic clusters often shift\ntogether, with most or all words in a group increasing in usage. This pattern\nsuggests that changes induced by Large Language Models are primarily semantic\nand pragmatic rather than purely lexical. Notably, the adjective \"important\"\nshows a significant decline, which prompted us to systematically analyze\ndecreasing lexical items. Our analysis of \"collapsing\" words reveals a more\ncomplex picture, which is consistent with organic language change and contrasts\nwith the patterns of the abrupt spikes. These insights into the structure of\nlanguage change contribute to our understanding of how language technology\ncontinues to shape human language.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u79d1\u5b66\u82f1\u8bed\u4e2d\u8bcd\u6c47\u9891\u7387\u7684\u7a81\u7136\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u7531\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982ChatGPT\uff09\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u8bed\u7528\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5355\u7eaf\u7684\u540c\u4e49\u8bcd\u66ff\u6362\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fd1\u5e74\u6765\u79d1\u5b66\u82f1\u8bed\u8bcd\u6c47\u9891\u7387\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u67d0\u4e9b\u8bcd\u6c47\uff08\u5982'delve'\u3001'intricate'\u3001'crucial'\uff09\u7684\u6fc0\u589e\uff0c\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u5bf9\u5176\u80cc\u540e\u8bed\u8a00\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u7591\u95ee\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7PubMed\u79d1\u5b66\u6458\u8981\u7684\u9891\u7387\u8d8b\u52bf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8bcd\u6027\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u540c\u4e49\u8bcd\u7ec4\u7684\u8bcd\u6c47\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u8bed\u4e49\u96c6\u7fa4\u6574\u4f53\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u4e3b\u8981\u662f\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u8bed\u7528\u5c42\u9762\u7684\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u67d0\u4e9b\u8bcd\u6c47\uff08\u5982'important'\uff09\u7684\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u8a00\u6280\u672f\uff08\u5982\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u5bf9\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u66f4\u591a\u4f53\u73b0\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u8bed\u7528\u5c42\u9762\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5355\u7eaf\u7684\u8bcd\u6c47\u66ff\u6362\u3002"}}

Diffusion transformers (DiTs)\nhave emerged as a promising alternative because of their superior performance.\nWe introduce OutDreamer, a DiT-based video outpainting framework comprising two\nmain components: an efficient video control branch and a conditional\noutpainting branch.

Such\nmultidimensional settings are not merely of theoretical interest but are\ncentral to many real-world applications. For example, cloud computing resources\nare evaluated based on multiple criteria such as CPU cores, memory, and network\nbandwidth. In such cases, traditional one dimensional fairness notions fail to\ncapture fairness across multiple attributes. To address these challenges, we\nstudy two relaxed variants of envy-freeness: weak simultaneously envy-free up\nto c goods (weak sEFc) and strong simultaneously envy-free up to c goods\n(strong sEFc), which accommodate the multidimensionality of agents'\npreferences. Under the weak notion, for every pair of agents and for each\ndimension, any perceived envy can be eliminated by removing, if necessary, a\ndifferent set of goods from the envied agent's allocation. In contrast, the\nstrong version requires selecting a single set of goods whose removal from the\nenvied bundle simultaneously eliminates envy in every dimension. We provide\nupper and lower bounds on the relaxation parameter c that guarantee the\nexistence of weak or strong sEFc allocations, where these bounds are\nindependent of the total number of items.

Among the\nstatements, we highlight the `Sim-Any' hypothesis as the most actionable, and\ndemonstrate how it can be leveraged by proposing data-free black-box UQ methods\nthat aggregate similarities between generations for confidence estimation.\nThese approaches can outperform the closest baselines, showcasing the practical\nvalue of the empirically observed consistency hypothesis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u8f93\u51fa\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\uff08\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u8ba1\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u7528\u6237\u4fe1\u4efb\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f30\u8ba1LLM\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u9ed1\u76d2\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\uff08UQ\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u5176\u4ec5\u9700\u6a21\u578bAPI\u8bbf\u95ee\u800c\u53d7\u5230\u6b22\u8fce\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u6570\u5b66\u9648\u8ff0\u53ca\u7edf\u8ba1\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u751f\u6210\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u8f93\u51fa\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u57288\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c3\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u95ee\u7b54\u3001\u6587\u672c\u6458\u8981\u3001\u6587\u672c\u8f6cSQL\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u666e\u904d\u6210\u7acb\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u2018Sim-Any\u2019\u5047\u8bbe\u6700\u5177\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u5408\u751f\u6210\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7684\u6570\u636e\u65e0\u5173\u9ed1\u76d2UQ\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Each modality expert then undergoes specialized\nsingle-modality training, followed by joint multimodal collaborative training.\nAs a result, DeepTalk incurs only a 5.5% performance drop compared to the\noriginal LLM, which is significantly lower than the average performance drop of\nover 20% typically seen in native MLLMs (such as GLM-4-Voice), and is on par\nwith modular MLLMs. Meanwhile, the end-to-end dialogue latency remains within\n0.5 seconds, ensuring a seamless and intelligent speech interaction experience.\nCode and models are released at https://github.com/talkking/DeepTalk.", "AI": {"tldr": "DeepTalk\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eMixture of Experts\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6a21\u6001\u4e13\u5bb6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u539f\u751f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u56e0\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u8db3\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u539f\u751fMLLMs\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u526f\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u5982\u60c5\u611f\u548c\u97f5\u5f8b\uff09\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u56e0\u914d\u5bf9\u8bed\u97f3-\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u8db3\u800c\u9762\u4e34\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "DeepTalk\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u533a\u5206\u6a21\u6001\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u534f\u4f5c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "result": "DeepTalk\u4ec5\u5bfc\u81f45.5%\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u539f\u751fMLLMs\u768420%\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4e14\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4fdd\u6301\u57280.5\u79d2\u5185\u3002", "conclusion": "DeepTalk\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u539f\u751fMLLMs\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u8bed\u97f3\u4ea4\u4e92\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

For solving the classification task, we\npropose the Chain of Counterfactual Thought framework, utilizing counterfactual\nreasoning, ASR-enhanced video content, and rationale refinement to reduce\ninference bias.

However, traditional deep learning approaches for\nECG analysis rely heavily on large-scale manual annotations, which are both\ntime-consuming and resource-intensive to obtain. To overcome this limitation,\nself-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising alternative, enabling\nthe extraction of robust ECG representations that can be efficiently\ntransferred to various downstream tasks. While previous studies have explored\nSSL for ECG pretraining and multi-modal ECG-language alignment, they often fail\nto capture the multi-scale nature of ECG signals.

We evaluate MELP on three\npublic ECG datasets across multiple tasks, including zero-shot ECG\nclassification, linear probing, and transfer learning.

In real-world applications, however, users\noften seek tools to faithfully realize their creative editing intentions with\nprecise and consistent control. Despite the progress achieved by existing\nmethods, ensuring fine-grained alignment with user intentions remains an open\nand challenging problem. In this work, we present Shape-for-Motion, a novel\nframework that incorporates a 3D proxy for precise and consistent video\nediting. Shape-for-Motion achieves this by converting the target object in the\ninput video to a time-consistent mesh, i.e., a 3D proxy, allowing edits to be\nperformed directly on the proxy and then inferred back to the video frames. To\nsimplify the editing process, we design a novel Dual-Propagation Strategy that\nallows users to perform edits on the 3D mesh of a single frame, and the edits\nare then automatically propagated to the 3D meshes of the other frames. The 3D\nmeshes for different frames are further projected onto the 2D space to produce\nthe edited geometry and texture renderings, which serve as inputs to a\ndecoupled video diffusion model for generating edited results. Our framework\nsupports various precise and physically-consistent manipulations across the\nvideo frames, including pose editing, rotation, scaling, translation, texture\nmodification, and object composition.

A straightforward solution is to adapt rule-based\nreinforcement learning for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However, such methods\ntypically rely on manually curated question-answer pairs, which can be\nparticularly challenging when dealing with fine grained visual details and\ncomplex logic across images. Inspired by self-supervised visual representation\nlearning, we observe that images contain inherent constraints that can serve as\nsupervision. Based on this insight, we construct image triplets comprising two\naugmented views of the same image and a third, similar but distinct image.\nDuring training, the model is prompted to generate a reasoning process to\ncompare these images (i.e., determine same or different). Then we optimize the\nmodel with rule-based reinforcement learning.

Results reveal that in\ngeneric features, HTs and MTs exhibit significant differences in conjunction\nword distributions and the ratio of 1-word-gram-YiYang, while NMTs and LLMs\nshow significant variation in descriptive words usage and adverb ratios.\nRegarding CTT-specific features, LLMs outperform NMTs in distribution, aligning\nmore closely with HTs in stylistic characteristics, demonstrating the potential\nof LLMs in CLT.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4ece\u98ce\u683c\u8ba1\u91cf\u5b66\u89d2\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff08MT\uff09\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff08HT\uff09\u5728\u82f1\u8bd1\u4e2d\u513f\u7ae5\u6587\u5b66\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff08CLT\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u98ce\u683c\u7279\u5f81\u4e0a\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u4eba\u5de5\u7ffb\u8bd1\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u5728\u513f\u7ae5\u6587\u5b66\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u98ce\u683c\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b21\u79cd\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7684\u300a\u5f7c\u5f97\u6f58\u300b\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u901a\u7528\u548c\u7279\u5b9a\u7279\u5f81\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u98ce\u683c\u8ba1\u91cf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u805a\u7c7b\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u901a\u7528\u7279\u5f81\u4e2d\uff0cHT\u4e0eMT\u5728\u8fde\u8bcd\u5206\u5e03\u548c1-gram-YiYang\u6bd4\u4f8b\u4e0a\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff1b\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u7279\u5f81\u4e2d\uff0cLLMs\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8eNMTs\uff0c\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1HT\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u5728\u513f\u7ae5\u6587\u5b66\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u98ce\u683c\u7279\u5f81\u4e0a\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u4eba\u5de5\u7ffb\u8bd1\u3002"}}

However, it presents significant challenges, including\naccurate inter-frame motion estimation, minimisation of drift accumulation over\nlong sequences, and generalisability across scanning protocols. The TUS-REC2024\nChallenge was established to benchmark and accelerate progress in trackerless\n3D ultrasound reconstruction by providing a publicly available dataset for the\nfirst time, along with a baseline model and evaluation framework. The Challenge\nattracted over 43 registered teams, of which 6 teams submitted 21 valid\ndockerized solutions. Submitted methods spanned a wide range of algorithmic\napproaches, including recurrent models, registration-driven volume refinement,\nattention, and physics-informed models. This paper presents an overview of the\nChallenge design, summarises the key characteristics of the dataset, provides a\nconcise literature review, introduces the technical details of the underlying\nmethodology working with tracked freehand ultrasound data, and offers a\ncomparative analysis of submitted methods across multiple evaluation metrics.\nThe results highlight both the progress and current limitations of\nstate-of-the-art approaches in this domain, and inform directions for future\nresearch. The data, evaluation code, and baseline are publicly available to\nfacilitate ongoing development and reproducibility. As a live and evolving\nbenchmark, this Challenge is designed to be continuously developed and\nimproved.

We implement our framework using\nLangGraph and evaluate it on the PKU PosterLayout dataset, a benchmark rich in\nsemantic and structural variability.

However, most evaluations of language models\nrely on static vignettes and multiple-choice questions that fail to reflect the\ncomplexity and nuance of evidence-based medicine in real-world settings.

To emulate this iterative process, we introduce the Sequential\nDiagnosis Benchmark, which transforms 304 diagnostically challenging New\nEngland Journal of Medicine clinicopathological conference (NEJM-CPC) cases\ninto stepwise diagnostic encounters.

However, current approaches require a large number of\ndenoising steps at the decoder to generate realistic results under extreme\nbitrate constraints, limiting their application in real-time compression\nscenarios. Additionally, these methods often sacrifice reconstruction fidelity,\nas diffusion models typically fail to guarantee pixel-level consistency. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce StableCodec, which enables one-step\ndiffusion for high-fidelity and high-realism extreme image compression with\nimproved coding efficiency. To achieve ultra-low bitrates, we first develop an\nefficient Deep Compression Latent Codec to transmit a noisy latent\nrepresentation for a single-step denoising process. We then propose a\nDual-Branch Coding Structure, consisting of a pair of auxiliary encoder and\ndecoder, to enhance reconstruction fidelity. Furthermore, we adopt end-to-end\noptimization with joint bitrate and pixel-level constraints.

Previous efforts heavily rely on paired data to improve\nthe generalization performance and robustness through collecting either diverse\nCT data for re-training or a few test data for fine-tuning. Recently, diffusion\nmodels have shown promising and generalizable performance in low-dose CT (LDCT)\nreconstruction, however, they may produce unrealistic structures due to the CT\nimage noise deviating from Gaussian distribution and imprecise prior\ninformation from the guidance of noisy LDCT images. In this paper, we propose a\nnoise-inspired diffusion model for generalizable LDCT reconstruction, termed\nNEED, which tailors diffusion models for noise characteristics of each domain.\nFirst, we propose a novel shifted Poisson diffusion model to denoise projection\ndata, which aligns the diffusion process with the noise model in pre-log LDCT\nprojections. Second, we devise a doubly guided diffusion model to refine\nreconstructed images, which leverages LDCT images and initial reconstructions\nto more accurately locate prior information and enhance reconstruction\nfidelity. By cascading these two diffusion models for dual-domain\nreconstruction, our NEED requires only normal-dose data for training and can be\neffectively extended to various unseen dose levels during testing via a time\nstep matching strategy. Extensive qualitative, quantitative, and\nsegmentation-based evaluations on two datasets demonstrate that our NEED\nconsistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction and\ngeneralization performance.

A common clinical approach mitigates this by\nsorting projections into respiratory phases and reconstructing images per\nphase, but this does not account for breathing variability. Dynamic CBCT\ninstead reconstructs images at each projection, capturing continuous motion\nwithout phase sorting. Recent advancements in 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS)\noffer powerful tools for modeling dynamic scenes, yet their application to\ndynamic CBCT remains underexplored. Existing 4DGS methods, such as HexPlane,\nuse implicit motion representations, which are computationally expensive. While\nexplicit low-rank motion models have been proposed, they lack spatial\nregularization, leading to inconsistencies in Gaussian motion. To address these\nlimitations, we introduce a free-form deformation (FFD)-based spatial basis\nfunction and a deformation-informed framework that enforces consistency by\ncoupling the temporal evolution of Gaussian's mean position, scale, and\nrotation under a unified deformation field. We evaluate our approach on six\nCBCT datasets, demonstrating superior image quality with a 6x speedup over\nHexPlane.

Finally, we derive results for the smoothness of NNGP\nsample paths, characterizing the smoothness of infinitely wide neural networks\nat initialization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5178\u578b\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\uff08\u5982SELU\u3001ELU\u3001LeakyReLU\uff09\u7684RKHS\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86ReLU\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u7f51\u7edc\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u4e3b\u8981\u5c40\u9650\u4e8eReLU\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5176\u4ed6\u5e38\u89c1\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\uff08\u5982SELU\u3001ELU\u3001LeakyReLU\uff09\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u795e\u7ecf\u6b63\u5207\u6838\uff08NTK\uff09\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6838\uff08NNGP\uff09\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5178\u578b\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u7684RKHS\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u7f51\u7edc\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4e00\u7c7b\u975e\u65e0\u9650\u5149\u6ed1\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7f51\u7edc\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e0b\u751f\u6210\u7b49\u6548\u7684RKHS\uff0c\u800c\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u5219\u751f\u6210\u975e\u7b49\u6548\u7684RKHS\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u5206\u6790\u4e86NNGP\u6837\u672c\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u5bf9\u975eReLU\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4e3a\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7f51\u7edc\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u7c7b\u578b\u5bf9RKHS\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

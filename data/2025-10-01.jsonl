However, the presence of vital\nsignals in facial videos raises significant privacy concerns, as they can\nreveal sensitive personal information related to the health and emotional\nstates of an individual. To address this, we propose a learned framework that\nedits physiological signals in videos while preserving visual fidelity. First,\nwe encode an input video into a latent space via a pretrained 3D Variational\nAutoencoder (3D VAE), while a target HR prompt is embedded through a frozen\ntext encoder. We fuse them using a set of trainable spatio-temporal layers with\nAdaptive Layer Normalizations (AdaLN) to capture the strong temporal coherence\nof remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG) signals. We apply Feature-wise Linear\nModulation (FiLM) in the decoder with a fine-tuned output layer to avoid the\ndegradation of physiological signals during reconstruction, enabling accurate\nphysiological modulation in the reconstructed video. Empirical results show\nthat our method preserves visual quality with an average PSNR of 38.96 dB and\nSSIM of 0.98 on selected datasets, while achieving an average HR modulation\nerror of 10.00 bpm MAE and 10.09% MAPE using a state-of-the-art rPPG estimator.\nOur design's controllable HR editing is useful for applications such as\nanonymizing biometric signals in real videos or synthesizing realistic videos\nwith desired vital signs."}

This letter presents a novel Bayesian Transformer approach for\nPan-Arctic SIC mapping and uncertainty quantification using Sentinel-1,\nRADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM), and Advanced Microwave Scanning\nRadiometer 2 (AMSR2) data. First, to improve feature extraction, we design a\nnovel high-resolution Transformer model with both global and local modules that\ncan better discern the subtle differences in sea ice patterns. Second, to\nimprove uncertainty quantification, we design a Bayesian extension of the\nproposed Transformer model, treating its parameters as random variables to more\neffectively capture uncertainties. Third, to address data heterogeneity, we\nfuse three different data types (Sentinel-1, RCM, and AMSR2) at decision-level\nto improve both SIC mapping and uncertainty quantification.

Precipitation exhibits a highly imbalanced\ndistribution: most observations record no or light rain, while heavy rainfall\nevents are rare. Such an imbalanced distribution obstructs deep learning models\nfrom effectively predicting heavy rainfall events. To address this challenge,\nwe treat rainfall forecasting explicitly as a long-tailed learning problem,\nidentifying the insufficient representation of heavy rainfall events as the\nprimary barrier to forecasting accuracy. Therefore, we introduce DPSformer, a\nlong-tail-aware model that enriches representation of heavy rainfall events\nthrough a high-resolution branch.

Specifically, we decompose the latent risk\nconcept space into three mutually exclusive subspaces: the explicit risk\nsubspace (encompassing direct violations of safety guidelines), the implicit\nrisk subspace (capturing potential malicious content that requires contextual\nreasoning for identification), and the non-risk subspace.

However, naively\napplying those MLLMs for detection often leads to suboptimal performance. We\nargue that the root of this failure lies in a fundamental mismatch: MLLMs are\nasked to reason about fakes before they can truly see them. First, they do not\nreally see: existing MLLMs' vision encoders are primarily optimized for\nsemantic-oriented recognition rather than the perception of low-level signals,\nleaving them insensitive to subtle forgery traces. Without access to reliable\nperceptual evidence, the model grounds its judgment on incomplete and limited\nvisual observations. Second, existing finetuning data for detection typically\nuses narrow, instruction-style formats, which diverge sharply from the diverse,\nheterogeneous distributions seen in pretraining. In the absence of meaningful\nvisual cues, the model therefore exploits these linguistic shortcuts, resulting\nin catastrophic forgetting of pretrained knowledge (even the basic dialogue\ncapabilities). In response, we advocate for a new paradigm: seeing before\nreasoning. We propose that MLLMs should first be trained to perceive\nartifacts-strengthening their artifact-aware visual perception-so that\nsubsequent reasoning is grounded in actual observations. We therefore propose\nForensic-Chat, a generalizable, explainable, and still-conversational (for\nmulti-round dialogue) assistant for fake image detection.

We\nevaluate dVLA in both simulation and the real world: on the LIBERO benchmark,\nit achieves state-of-the-art performance with a 96.4% average success rate,\nconsistently surpassing both discrete and continuous action policies; on a real\nFranka robot, it succeeds across a diverse task suite, including a challenging\nbin-picking task that requires multi-step planning, demonstrating robust\nreal-world performance. Together, these results underscore the promise of\nunified diffusion frameworks for practical, high-performance VLA robotics."}

However, as long-term memory context grows over time, they\nstruggle to maintain coherence. This deficiency leads to critical failures,\nincluding identity drift, ignoring established beliefs, and the propagation of\nhallucinations in multi-agent systems. To mitigate these challenges, this paper\nintroduces Identity Retrieval-Augmented Generation (ID-RAG), a novel mechanism\ndesigned to ground an agent's persona and persistent preferences in a dynamic,\nstructured identity model: a knowledge graph of core beliefs, traits, and\nvalues. During the agent's decision loop, this model is queried to retrieve\nrelevant identity context, which directly informs action selection. We\ndemonstrate this approach by introducing and implementing a new class of ID-RAG\nenabled agents called Human-AI Agents (HAis), where the identity model is\ninspired by the Chronicle structure used in Perspective-Aware AI, a dynamic\nknowledge graph learned from a real-world entity's digital footprint. In social\nsimulations of a mayoral election, HAis using ID-RAG outperformed baseline\nagents in long-horizon persona coherence - achieving higher identity recall\nacross all tested models by the fourth timestep - and reduced simulation\nconvergence time by 19% (GPT-4o) and 58% (GPT-4o mini).

Our\napproach employs a high-performing English LLM as a \"pivot\" model to generate\nreference responses for reasoning tasks. A multilingual model is then rewarded\nbased on the semantic equivalence of its responses to the English reference,\neffectively transferring the pivot model's reasoning capabilities across\nlanguages. We investigate several cross-lingual semantic reward functions,\nincluding those based on embeddings and machine translation. Extensive\nexperiments on a suite of multilingual reasoning benchmarks show that our\nmethod significantly narrows the performance gap between English and other\nlanguages, substantially outperforming traditional PPO baselines.

Existing behavioral control methods face\nsignificant limitations: system prompting approaches could easily be overridden\nby user instructions, while applying activation-based steering vectors requires\ninvasive runtime access to model internals, precluding deployment with\nAPI-based services and closed-source models. Finding steering methods that\ntransfer across multiple VLMs is still an open area of research. To this end,\nwe introduce universal visual input based steering for output redirection\n(VISOR++), to achieve behavioral control through optimized visual inputs alone.\nWe demonstrate that a single VISOR++ image can be generated for an ensemble of\nVLMs to emulate each of their steering vectors. By crafting universal visual\ninputs that induce target activation patterns, VISOR++ eliminates the need for\nruntime model access while remaining deployment-agnostic. This means that when\nan underlying model supports multimodal capability, model behaviors can be\nsteered by inserting an image input replacing runtime steering vector based\ninterventions. We first demonstrate the effectiveness of the VISOR++ images on\nopen-access models such as LLaVA-1.5-7B and IDEFICS2-8B along three alignment\ndirections: refusal, sycophancy and survival instinct.

This\nfragmentation contrasts sharply with clinical practice, where experts\nseamlessly integrate diverse knowledge: anatomical priors from training,\nexemplar-based reasoning from reference cases, and iterative refinement through\nreal-time interaction. We present $\\textbf{K-Prism}$, a unified segmentation\nframework that mirrors this clinical flexibility by systematically integrating\nthree knowledge paradigms: (i) $\\textit{semantic priors}$ learned from\nannotated datasets, (ii) $\\textit{in-context knowledge}$ from few-shot\nreference examples, and (iii) $\\textit{interactive feedback}$ from user inputs\nlike clicks or scribbles. Our key insight is that these heterogeneous knowledge\nsources can be encoded into a dual-prompt representation: 1-D sparse prompts\ndefining $\\textit{what}$ to segment and 2-D dense prompts indicating\n$\\textit{where}$ to attend, which are then dynamically routed through a\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE) decoder.

When it comes\nto scene reconstruction, this human perception trait calls for spatially\nvarying degrees of detail ready for closer inspection in critical regions,\npreferably reconstructed on demand. While recent works in 3D Gaussian Splatting\n(3DGS) achieve fast, generalizable reconstruction from sparse views, their\nuniform resolution output leads to high computational costs unscalable to\nhigh-resolution training. As a result, they cannot leverage available images at\ntheir original high resolution to reconstruct details.

To bridge the gap between\nthe prohibitive cost of high-resolution holistic reconstructions and the user\nneeds for localized fine details, we propose the problem of localized\nhigh-resolution reconstruction via on-demand Gaussian densification. Given a\nlow-resolution 3DGS reconstruction, the goal is to learn a generalizable\nnetwork that densifies the initial 3DGS to capture fine details in a\nuser-specified local region of interest (RoI), based on sparse high-resolution\nobservations of the RoI.

While generative models in other domains exhibit well-established scaling\nlaws, our work reveals that SID-based GR shows significant bottlenecks while\nscaling up the model. In particular, the performance of SID-based GR quickly\nsaturates as we enlarge each component: the modality encoder, the quantization\ntokenizer, and the RS itself. In this work, we identify the limited capacity of\nSIDs to encode item semantic information as one of the fundamental bottlenecks.\nMotivated by this observation, as an initial effort to obtain GR models with\nbetter scaling behaviors, we revisit another GR paradigm that directly uses\nlarge language models (LLMs) as recommenders (henceforth, LLM-as-RS).

To address this, we present\nProbabilistic Modality-Enhanced Diagnosis (ProbMED), a multimodal Med-VLPM that\nemploys probabilistic contrastive learning to model distributions over\nembeddings rather than deterministic estimates. ProbMED aligns four distinct\nmodalities -- chest X-rays, electrocardiograms, echocardiograms, and clinical\ntext -- into a unified probabilistic embedding space. We use InfoNCE loss with\nHellinger distance to integrate inter-modality distributions. We introduce a\nprobabilistic synthetic sampling loss that captures modality-specific mean and\nvariance to improve intra-modality binding. Extensive experiments across 13\nmedical datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms current Med-VLPMs in\ncross-modality retrieval, zero-shot, and few-shot classification. We also\ndemonstrate the robust integration of multiple modalities for prognostication,\nshowing improved intra- and inter-medical modality binding."}

One particular difficulty to\novercome is when regions of the cost map switch between being marked as\nobstacles and free space through successive planning cycles. One potential\nsolution to this, which we refer to as Valid in Every Hypothesis (VEH), is for\nthe planning system to plan motions that are guaranteed to be safe through a\nhistory of world models. Another approach is to track a history of world\nmodels, and adjust node costs according to the potential penalty of needing to\nreroute around previously hazardous areas. This work discusses three major\niterations on this idea. The first iteration, called PEH, invokes a sub-search\nfor every node expansion that crosses through a divergence point in the world\nmodels. The second and third iterations, called GEH and GEGRH respectively,\ndefer the sub-search until after an edge expands into the goal region.

In this work, we introduce a novel framework, DECS, built on our\ntheoretical discovery of two previously unaddressed flaws in current length\nrewards: (1) the erroneous penalization of essential exploratory tokens and (2)\nthe inadvertent rewarding of partial redundancy. Our framework's innovations\ninclude (i) a first-of-its-kind decoupled token-level reward mechanism that\nsurgically distinguishes and penalizes redundant tokens, and (ii) a novel\ncurriculum batch scheduling strategy to master the efficiency-efficacy\nequilibrium. Experimental results show DECS can achieve a dramatic reduction in\nreasoning tokens by over 50\\% across seven benchmarks while simultaneously\nmaintaining or even improving performance.

In this work, we\nintroduce Text Preference Optimization (TPO), a framework that enables\n\"free-lunch\" alignment of T2I models, achieving alignment without the need for\npaired image preference data. TPO works by training the model to prefer matched\nprompts over mismatched prompts, which are constructed by perturbing original\ncaptions using a large language model. Our framework is general and compatible\nwith existing preference-based algorithms. We extend both DPO and KTO to our\nsetting, resulting in TDPO and TKTO. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations\nacross multiple benchmarks show that our methods consistently outperform their\noriginal counterparts, delivering better human preference scores and improved\ntext-to-image alignment.

To address these\nlimitations, we propose DyFlow, a dynamic workflow generation framework that\nadaptively constructs and adjusts reasoning procedures based on task\nrequirements and real-time intermediate feedback, thereby enhancing cross-task\ngeneralization. DyFlow consists of two core components: a designer and an\nexecutor. The designer decomposes complex problems into a sequence of sub-goals\ndefined by high-level objectives and dynamically plans the next steps based on\nintermediate outputs and feedback. These plans are then carried out by the\nexecutor, which executes each operation using dynamic operators with\ncontext-aware parameterization, enabling flexible and semantically grounded\nreasoning. We systematically evaluate DyFlow across diverse domains, including\nsocial reasoning, biomedical tasks, mathematical problem solving, and code\ngeneration. Results demonstrate that DyFlow significantly outperforms existing\nbaselines, achieving substantial Pass@k improvements and exhibiting robust\ngeneralization across diverse domains. The code is publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/wyf23187/DyFlow."}

When ad\nideas were simplified step by step, creative features such as metaphors,\nemotions, and visual cues disappeared early, while factual content remained,\nshowing that models favor high-probability information. When asked to\nregenerate from simplified inputs, models produced longer outputs with lexical\nvariety but failed to recover the depth and distinctiveness of the originals.\nWe combined quantitative comparisons with qualitative analysis, which revealed\nthat the regenerated texts often appeared novel but lacked true originality.\nProviding ad-specific cues such as metaphors, emotional hooks and visual\nmarkers improved alignment and stylistic balance, though outputs still relied\non familiar tropes. Taken together, the findings show that without targeted\nguidance, LLMs drift towards mediocrity in creative tasks; structured signals\ncan partially counter this tendency and point towards pathways for developing\ncreativity-sensitive models."}

However, existing approaches\noften underutilize the linguistic intelligence of these models, typically\nfailing to leverage their powerful instruction-following capabilities. This\nlimitation hinders the model's ability to follow text instructions for\ncontrollable Text-to-Speech~(TTS). To address this, we propose a new paradigm\ninspired by ``operationalism'' that decouples instruction understanding from\nspeech generation. We introduce BatonVoice, a framework where an LLM acts as a\n``conductor'', understanding user instructions and generating a textual\n``plan'' -- explicit vocal features (e.g., pitch, energy). A separate TTS\nmodel, the ``orchestra'', then generates the speech from these features. To\nrealize this component, we develop BatonTTS, a TTS model trained specifically\nfor this task. Our experiments demonstrate that BatonVoice achieves strong\nperformance in controllable and emotional speech synthesis, outperforming\nstrong open- and closed-source baselines. Notably, our approach enables\nremarkable zero-shot cross-lingual generalization, accurately applying feature\ncontrol abilities to languages unseen during post-training. This demonstrates\nthat objectifying speech into textual vocal features can more effectively\nunlock the linguistic intelligence of LLMs."}

To unlock learning from these hard samples,\nwe propose NuRL, a \"nudging\" method that aims to push the upper bound of LLM\nreasoning using self-generated hints, i.e., abstract cues that help reduce the\nproblem difficulty for the model. Given a question and its gold answer, the\nmodel generates a CoT and then produces a hint containing the core knowledge\nneeded to solve the problem. During training, we generate G rollouts from the\nbase policy and use the pass rate to decide whether the hint should be\ninjected. For hard samples with a 0% pass rate, we inject the hint and\nregenerate a new batch of trajectories.

At the scale of the Internet, there are tens\nof thousands of potential topics, and finding the most difficult one by drawing\nand evaluating a large number of examples across all topics is computationally\ninfeasible. We formalize this task and treat it as a multi-armed bandit\nproblem. In this framework, each topic is an ''arm,'' and pulling an arm (at a\ncost) involves drawing a single example, evaluating it, and measuring its\ndifficulty. The goal is to efficiently identify the most difficult topics\nwithin a fixed computational budget.

We introduce\nautonomy-aware clustering, a reinforcement (RL) learning framework that learns\nand accounts for the influence of local autonomy without requiring prior\nknowledge of its form. Our approach integrates RL with a deterministic\nannealing (DA) procedure, where, to determine underlying clusters, DA naturally\npromotes exploration in early stages of annealing and transitions to\nexploitation later.

Beyond the spurious dependencies induced by\nlatent confounders, we highlight a common yet often overlooked challenge in the\nproblem due to post-treatment selection, in which samples are selectively\nincluded in datasets after interventions. This fundamental challenge widely\nexists in biological studies; for example, in gene expression analysis, both\nobservational and interventional samples are retained only if they meet quality\ncontrol criteria (e.g., highly active cells). Neglecting post-treatment\nselection may introduce spurious dependencies and distributional changes under\ninterventions, which can mimic causal responses, thereby distorting causal\ndiscovery results and challenging existing causal formulations. To address\nthis, we introduce a novel causal formulation that explicitly models\npost-treatment selection and reveals how its differential reactions to\ninterventions can distinguish causal relations from selection patterns,\nallowing us to go beyond traditional equivalence classes toward the underlying\ntrue causal structure. We then characterize its Markov properties and propose a\nFine-grained Interventional equivalence class, named FI-Markov equivalence,\nrepresented by a new graphical diagram, F-PAG.

Since large\nlanguage models (LLMs) lack sentience - and themselves disclaim having selfhood\nor identity - one anticipated benefit is that they will be protected from, and\nin turn protect us from, distortions in our decisions. Yet, across 5 studies\nand ~20,000 queries, we discovered massive self-preferences in four widely used\nLLMs. In word-association tasks, models overwhelmingly paired positive\nattributes with their own names, companies, and CEOs relative to those of their\ncompetitors. Strikingly, when models were queried through APIs this\nself-preference vanished, initiating detection work that revealed API models\noften lack clear recognition of themselves. This peculiar feature\nserendipitously created opportunities to test the causal link between\nself-recognition and self-love. By directly manipulating LLM identity - i.e.,\nexplicitly informing LLM1 that it was indeed LLM1, or alternatively, convincing\nLLM1 that it was LLM2 - we found that self-love consistently followed assigned,\nnot true, identity. Importantly, LLM self-love emerged in consequential\nsettings beyond word-association tasks, when evaluating job candidates,\nsecurity software proposals and medical chatbots. Far from bypassing this human\nbias, self-love appears to be deeply encoded in LLM cognition. This result\nraises questions about whether LLM behavior will be systematically influenced\nby self-preferential tendencies, including a bias toward their own operation\nand even their own existence. We call on corporate creators of these models to\ncontend with a significant rupture in a core promise of LLMs - neutrality in\njudgment and decision-making."}

The key\ntechnical innovations include: (i) a retrieval-based pipeline extracting\nhigh-level motion features using video encoder and specialized resamplers to\ndistill semantic motion representations; (ii) an in-context learning approach\nfor motion adaptation implemented through a causal transformer architecture;\n(iii) an attention-based motion injection adapter that seamlessly integrates\ntransferred motion features into pretrained video diffusion models. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements\nacross multiple domains and various base models, all with negligible\ncomputational overhead during inference. Furthermore, our modular design\nenables zero-shot generalization to new domains by simply updating the\nretrieval database without retraining any components. This research enhances\nthe core capability of video generation systems by enabling the effective\nretrieval and transfer of motion priors, facilitating the synthesis of\nrealistic motion dynamics."}

In this study,\nwe develop a generalization error bound that possesses a certified robust\nradius for the smoothed majority vote classifier (i.e., the $Q$-weighted\nmajority vote classifier with smoothed inputs); In other words, the\ngeneralization bound holds under any data perturbation within the certified\nrobust radius. As a byproduct, we find that the underpinnings of both the\ngeneralization bound and the certified robust radius draw, in part, upon weight\nspectral norm, which thereby inspires the adoption of spectral regularization\nin smooth training to boost certified robustness. Utilizing the\ndimension-independent property of spherical Gaussian inputs in smooth training,\nwe propose a novel and inexpensive spectral regularizer to enhance the smoothed\nmajority vote classifier.

The perceptual losses operate in a latent feature space defined by a\npretrained encoder and aim to preserve semantic content by comparing high-level\nfeatures rather than raw pixel values. However, the design of perceptual losses\ninvolves critical yet underexplored decisions, including the feature\nrepresentation level, the dataset used to pretrain the encoder, and the\nrelative importance assigned to the perceptual component during optimization.\nIn this work, we introduce the concept of perceptual influence (a metric that\nquantifies the relative contribution of the perceptual loss term to the total\nloss) and propose a principled framework to assess the impact of the loss\ndesign choices on the model training performance.

To address this, we propose\nDiffCamera, a model that enables flexible refocusing of a created image\nconditioned on an arbitrary new focus point and a blur level.

Motivated by this associative memory view,\nwe then explain Muon's superiority on real-world corpora, which are\nintrinsically heavy-tailed: a few classes (tail classes) appear far less\nfrequently than others. The superiority is explained through two key\nproperties: (i) its update rule consistently yields a more isotropic singular\nspectrum than Adam; and as a result, (ii) on heavy-tailed data, it optimizes\ntail classes more effectively than Adam. Beyond empirical evidence, we\ntheoretically confirm these findings by analyzing a one-layer associative\nmemory model under class-imbalanced data.

The envisaged approach (a) enhances the overall model accuracy\nin case of highly heterogeneous data and (b) optimizes the resource utilization\nfor resource constrained IoV networks, thereby leading to increased efficiency\nin the FL process. We evaluated FedCLF vis-\\`a-vis baseline models, i.e.,\nFedAvg, Newt, and Oort, using CIFAR-10 dataset with varying data heterogeneity.\nOur results depict that FedCLF significantly outperforms the baseline models by\nup to a 16% improvement in high data heterogeneity-related scenarios with\nimproved efficiency via reduced sampling frequency."}

First, as a safety dial:\nby evaluating more terms, developers and regulators can \"buy\" stronger\nguardrails from the same model. Second, as an adaptive cascade: clear cases\nexit early after low-order checks, and higher-order guardrails are evaluated\nonly for ambiguous inputs, reducing overall monitoring costs. On two\nlarge-scale safety datasets (WildGuardMix and BeaverTails), for 4 models with\nup to 30B parameters, we show that TPCs compete with or outperform MLP-based\nprobe baselines of the same size, all the while being more interpretable than\ntheir black-box counterparts.

Since large\nlanguage models (LLMs) lack sentience - and themselves disclaim having selfhood\nor identity - one anticipated benefit is that they will be protected from, and\nin turn protect us from, distortions in our decisions. Yet, across 5 studies\nand ~20,000 queries, we discovered massive self-preferences in four widely used\nLLMs. In word-association tasks, models overwhelmingly paired positive\nattributes with their own names, companies, and CEOs relative to those of their\ncompetitors. Strikingly, when models were queried through APIs this\nself-preference vanished, initiating detection work that revealed API models\noften lack clear recognition of themselves. This peculiar feature\nserendipitously created opportunities to test the causal link between\nself-recognition and self-love. By directly manipulating LLM identity - i.e.,\nexplicitly informing LLM1 that it was indeed LLM1, or alternatively, convincing\nLLM1 that it was LLM2 - we found that self-love consistently followed assigned,\nnot true, identity. Importantly, LLM self-love emerged in consequential\nsettings beyond word-association tasks, when evaluating job candidates,\nsecurity software proposals and medical chatbots. Far from bypassing this human\nbias, self-love appears to be deeply encoded in LLM cognition. This result\nraises questions about whether LLM behavior will be systematically influenced\nby self-preferential tendencies, including a bias toward their own operation\nand even their own existence. We call on corporate creators of these models to\ncontend with a significant rupture in a core promise of LLMs - neutrality in\njudgment and decision-making."}

AC-RL improves average accuracy by 4.4\npoints over pretrained baselines across seven visual mathematical reasoning\nbenchmarks, and analysis shows it would cut clarification requests by up to 39%\nif those were allowed.

This dependence, which can manifest itself even as\nsimple correlations, undermines the misconception that these sets can be\nindependently manipulated during unlearning. We provide empirical and\ntheoretical evidence showing these methods often fail precisely due to this\noverlooked relationship. For random forget sets, this dependence means that\ndegrading forget set metrics (which, for a retrained model, should mirror test\nset metrics) inevitably harms overall test performance. Going beyond random\nsets, we consider logistic regression as an instructive example where a\ncritical failure mode emerges: inter-set dependence causes gradient\ndescent-ascent iterations to progressively diverge from the ideal retrained\nmodel. Strikingly, these methods can converge to solutions that are not only\nfar from the retrained ideal but are potentially even further from it than the\noriginal model itself, rendering the unlearning process actively detrimental. A\ntoy example further illustrates how this dependence can trap models in inferior\nlocal minima, inescapable via finetuning. Our findings highlight that the\npresence of such statistical dependencies, even when manifest only as\ncorrelations, can be sufficient for ascent-based unlearning to fail.

This paper presents the first systematic investigation\nchallenging the fixed block size assumption in semi-AR decoding. Through a\nstatistical analysis of confidence dynamics during the denoising process, we\nidentify a volatility band (VB) region during dLLM decoding, which encodes\nlocal semantic structure and can be used to guide adaptive block sizing.\nLeveraging these insights, we introduce AdaBlock-dLLM, a training-free,\nplug-and-play scheduler that adaptively aligns block boundaries with semantic\nsteps by adjusting block size during runtime. Extensive experiments across\ndiverse benchmarks show that AdaBlock-dLLM achieves up to 5.3% accuracy\nimprovement under the same throughput budget.

Existing benchmarks primarily probe surface-level\nsemantic correspondence (e.g., object-text matching) while failing to assess\nthe deeper reasoning required to capture complex relationships between visual\nand textual information. To address this gap, we introduce MR$^2$-Bench, a\nreasoning-intensive benchmark for multimodal retrieval. MR$^2$-Bench presents\nthe following critical values: 1) all tasks are reasoning-driven, going beyond\nshallow matching to effectively assess models' capacity for logical, spatial,\nand causal inference; 2) it features diverse multimodal data, such as natural\nimages, diagrams, and visual puzzles, enabling comprehensive evaluation across\ncontent types; 3) it supports complex queries and documents containing multiple\nimages and covers diverse retrieval scenarios, more accurately reflecting\nreal-world applications. Our benchmark contains 1,309 curated queries, derived\neither from manual collection and annotation or from selective consolidation of\npublic datasets. Despite achieving strong results on existing benchmarks,\ncurrent state-of-the-art models still struggle on MR$^2$-Bench: for example,\nthe leading Seed1.6-Embedding model attains a Recall@1 of 77.78 on MMEB, but\nonly 9.91 on MR$^2$-Bench.

Subsequently, we propose guiding questions to frame class\ndiscussions around AI policy in technical and non-technical (e.g., ethics) CS\ncourses. Throughout, we emphasize the connection between normative policy\ndemands and still-open technical challenges relating to their implementation\nand enforcement through code and governance structures. This paper therefore\nrepresents a valuable contribution towards bridging research and discussions\nacross the areas of AI policy and CS education, underlining the need to prepare\nAI engineers to interact with and adapt to societal policy preferences."}

We address\nthese questions by analyzing the hidden states at the core of transformer\ncomputations, which capture intermediate results and act as carriers of\ninformation.

To address this, we propose\nthe Thinking-supervised Reward Model (TRM), which incorporates sentence-level\nthinking supervision to endow reward models with critical thinking abilities.\nGiven a query, answer, and supporting documents, TRM first assesses the\nfaithfulness of each answer sentence to the supporting documents, and then\napplies a reasoning step to evaluate sentence-level correctness. By structuring\nreward modeling as a sequence of faithfulness, reasoning, and correctness\nevaluations, TRM encourages models to critically assess and leverage both\nexternal and internal knowledge. Experiments on reward signals demonstrate that\nTRM substantially improves the identification of incorrect sentences, and\nincorporating TRM into policy optimization leads to significant gains in both\nanswer correctness and usefulness."}

In light of this, we propose\na method that constructs DFT initial guesses by predicting the electron density\nin a compact auxiliary basis representation using E(3)-equivariant neural\nnetworks. Trained on small molecules with up to 20 atoms, our model is able to\nachieve an average 33.3% self-consistent field (SCF) step reduction on systems\nup to 60 atoms, substantially outperforming Hamiltonian-centric and DM-centric\nmodels. Critically, this acceleration remains nearly constant with increasing\nsystem sizes and exhibits strong transferring behaviors across orbital basis\nsets and exchange-correlation (XC) functionals. To the best of our knowledge,\nthis work represents the first and robust candidate for a universally\ntransferable DFT acceleration method. We are also releasing the SCFbench\ndataset and its accompanying code to facilitate future research in this\npromising direction."}

Building on these advancements, diffusion\nmodels have also demonstrated exceptional performance in text-guided image\nediting. A key strategy for effective image editing involves inverting the\nsource image into editable noise maps associated with the target image.\nHowever, previous inversion methods face challenges in adhering closely to the\ntarget text prompt. The limitation arises because inverted noise maps, while\nenabling faithful reconstruction of the source image, restrict the flexibility\nneeded for desired edits. To overcome this issue, we propose Editable Noise Map\nInversion (ENM Inversion), a novel inversion technique that searches for\noptimal noise maps to ensure both content preservation and editability. We\nanalyze the properties of noise maps for enhanced editability. Based on this\nanalysis, our method introduces an editable noise refinement that aligns with\nthe desired edits by minimizing the difference between the reconstructed and\nedited noise maps.

This paper demystifies this mechanism through the lens of associative\nmemory. By ablating the transformer components optimized by Muon, we reveal\nthat the associative memory parameters of LLMs, namely the Value and Output\n(VO) attention weights and Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs), are the primary\ncontributors to Muon's superiority. Motivated by this associative memory view,\nwe then explain Muon's superiority on real-world corpora, which are\nintrinsically heavy-tailed: a few classes (tail classes) appear far less\nfrequently than others. The superiority is explained through two key\nproperties: (i) its update rule consistently yields a more isotropic singular\nspectrum than Adam; and as a result, (ii) on heavy-tailed data, it optimizes\ntail classes more effectively than Adam. Beyond empirical evidence, we\ntheoretically confirm these findings by analyzing a one-layer associative\nmemory model under class-imbalanced data. We prove that Muon consistently\nachieves balanced learning across classes regardless of feature embeddings,\nwhereas Adam can induce large disparities in learning errors depending on\nembedding properties. In summary, our empirical observations and theoretical\nanalyses reveal Muon's core advantage: its update rule aligns with the\nouter-product structure of linear associative memories, enabling more balanced\nand effective learning of tail classes in heavy-tailed distributions than Adam."}

It is an\nenhancement of the Voronoi Watershed Loss from Point2RBox-v2, which overcomes\nthe shortcomings of Watershed in its poor performance in sparse scenes and\nSAM's poor performance in dense scenes. To our knowledge, Point2RBox-v3 is the\nfirst model to employ dynamic pseudo labels for label assignment, and it\ncreatively complements the advantages of SAM model with the watershed\nalgorithm, which achieves excellent performance in both sparse and dense\nscenes.

Going beyond random\nsets, we consider logistic regression as an instructive example where a\ncritical failure mode emerges: inter-set dependence causes gradient\ndescent-ascent iterations to progressively diverge from the ideal retrained\nmodel. Strikingly, these methods can converge to solutions that are not only\nfar from the retrained ideal but are potentially even further from it than the\noriginal model itself, rendering the unlearning process actively detrimental.

A recent example of such sharing,\nbetween commercial systems, is the 6 GHz band (5.925 - 7.125 GHz) where\nunlicensed, low-power-indoor (LPI) users share the band with outdoor\nincumbents, primarily fixed microwave links. However, to date, there exist no\nreliable, automatic means of determining whether a device is indoors or\noutdoors, necessitating the use of other mechanisms such as mandating indoor\naccess points (APs) to have integrated antennas and not be battery powered, and\nreducing transmit power of client devices which may be outdoors.

Another key issue is hallucination, where models generate plausible\nyet false information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a\nstrategy to mitigate hallucinations by combining external retrieval with text\ngeneration.

Through systematic analysis, we reveal that visual priors-the\nimplicit, emergent knowledge about the visual world acquired during language\npre-training-are composed of separable perception and reasoning priors with\nunique scaling trends and origins. We show that an LLM's latent visual\nreasoning ability is predominantly developed by pre-training on\nreasoning-centric data (e.g., code, math, academia) and scales progressively.\nThis reasoning prior acquired from language pre-training is transferable and\nuniversally applicable to visual reasoning.

Stitch produces images that are both\nspatially accurate and visually appealing by generating individual objects\nwithin designated bounding boxes and seamlessly stitching them together.

Tested on Qwen-Image, FLUX, and SD3.5, Stitch consistently enhances\nbase models, even improving FLUX by 218% on GenEval's Position task and by 206%\non PosEval. Stitch achieves state-of-the-art results with Qwen-Image on\nPosEval, improving over previous models by 54%, all accomplished while\nintegrating position control into leading models training-free.

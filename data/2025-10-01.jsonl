However, the presence of vital\nsignals in facial videos raises significant privacy concerns, as they can\nreveal sensitive personal information related to the health and emotional\nstates of an individual. To address this, we propose a learned framework that\nedits physiological signals in videos while preserving visual fidelity. First,\nwe encode an input video into a latent space via a pretrained 3D Variational\nAutoencoder (3D VAE), while a target HR prompt is embedded through a frozen\ntext encoder. We fuse them using a set of trainable spatio-temporal layers with\nAdaptive Layer Normalizations (AdaLN) to capture the strong temporal coherence\nof remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG) signals. We apply Feature-wise Linear\nModulation (FiLM) in the decoder with a fine-tuned output layer to avoid the\ndegradation of physiological signals during reconstruction, enabling accurate\nphysiological modulation in the reconstructed video. Empirical results show\nthat our method preserves visual quality with an average PSNR of 38.96 dB and\nSSIM of 0.98 on selected datasets, while achieving an average HR modulation\nerror of 10.00 bpm MAE and 10.09% MAPE using a state-of-the-art rPPG estimator.\nOur design's controllable HR editing is useful for applications such as\nanonymizing biometric signals in real videos or synthesizing realistic videos\nwith desired vital signs."}

This letter presents a novel Bayesian Transformer approach for\nPan-Arctic SIC mapping and uncertainty quantification using Sentinel-1,\nRADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM), and Advanced Microwave Scanning\nRadiometer 2 (AMSR2) data. First, to improve feature extraction, we design a\nnovel high-resolution Transformer model with both global and local modules that\ncan better discern the subtle differences in sea ice patterns. Second, to\nimprove uncertainty quantification, we design a Bayesian extension of the\nproposed Transformer model, treating its parameters as random variables to more\neffectively capture uncertainties. Third, to address data heterogeneity, we\nfuse three different data types (Sentinel-1, RCM, and AMSR2) at decision-level\nto improve both SIC mapping and uncertainty quantification.

Precipitation exhibits a highly imbalanced\ndistribution: most observations record no or light rain, while heavy rainfall\nevents are rare. Such an imbalanced distribution obstructs deep learning models\nfrom effectively predicting heavy rainfall events. To address this challenge,\nwe treat rainfall forecasting explicitly as a long-tailed learning problem,\nidentifying the insufficient representation of heavy rainfall events as the\nprimary barrier to forecasting accuracy. Therefore, we introduce DPSformer, a\nlong-tail-aware model that enriches representation of heavy rainfall events\nthrough a high-resolution branch.

However, naively\napplying those MLLMs for detection often leads to suboptimal performance. We\nargue that the root of this failure lies in a fundamental mismatch: MLLMs are\nasked to reason about fakes before they can truly see them. First, they do not\nreally see: existing MLLMs' vision encoders are primarily optimized for\nsemantic-oriented recognition rather than the perception of low-level signals,\nleaving them insensitive to subtle forgery traces. Without access to reliable\nperceptual evidence, the model grounds its judgment on incomplete and limited\nvisual observations. Second, existing finetuning data for detection typically\nuses narrow, instruction-style formats, which diverge sharply from the diverse,\nheterogeneous distributions seen in pretraining. In the absence of meaningful\nvisual cues, the model therefore exploits these linguistic shortcuts, resulting\nin catastrophic forgetting of pretrained knowledge (even the basic dialogue\ncapabilities). In response, we advocate for a new paradigm: seeing before\nreasoning. We propose that MLLMs should first be trained to perceive\nartifacts-strengthening their artifact-aware visual perception-so that\nsubsequent reasoning is grounded in actual observations. We therefore propose\nForensic-Chat, a generalizable, explainable, and still-conversational (for\nmulti-round dialogue) assistant for fake image detection.

We\nevaluate dVLA in both simulation and the real world: on the LIBERO benchmark,\nit achieves state-of-the-art performance with a 96.4% average success rate,\nconsistently surpassing both discrete and continuous action policies; on a real\nFranka robot, it succeeds across a diverse task suite, including a challenging\nbin-picking task that requires multi-step planning, demonstrating robust\nreal-world performance. Together, these results underscore the promise of\nunified diffusion frameworks for practical, high-performance VLA robotics."}

However, as long-term memory context grows over time, they\nstruggle to maintain coherence. This deficiency leads to critical failures,\nincluding identity drift, ignoring established beliefs, and the propagation of\nhallucinations in multi-agent systems. To mitigate these challenges, this paper\nintroduces Identity Retrieval-Augmented Generation (ID-RAG), a novel mechanism\ndesigned to ground an agent's persona and persistent preferences in a dynamic,\nstructured identity model: a knowledge graph of core beliefs, traits, and\nvalues. During the agent's decision loop, this model is queried to retrieve\nrelevant identity context, which directly informs action selection. We\ndemonstrate this approach by introducing and implementing a new class of ID-RAG\nenabled agents called Human-AI Agents (HAis), where the identity model is\ninspired by the Chronicle structure used in Perspective-Aware AI, a dynamic\nknowledge graph learned from a real-world entity's digital footprint. In social\nsimulations of a mayoral election, HAis using ID-RAG outperformed baseline\nagents in long-horizon persona coherence - achieving higher identity recall\nacross all tested models by the fourth timestep - and reduced simulation\nconvergence time by 19% (GPT-4o) and 58% (GPT-4o mini).

Our\napproach employs a high-performing English LLM as a \"pivot\" model to generate\nreference responses for reasoning tasks. A multilingual model is then rewarded\nbased on the semantic equivalence of its responses to the English reference,\neffectively transferring the pivot model's reasoning capabilities across\nlanguages. We investigate several cross-lingual semantic reward functions,\nincluding those based on embeddings and machine translation. Extensive\nexperiments on a suite of multilingual reasoning benchmarks show that our\nmethod significantly narrows the performance gap between English and other\nlanguages, substantially outperforming traditional PPO baselines.

Existing behavioral control methods face\nsignificant limitations: system prompting approaches could easily be overridden\nby user instructions, while applying activation-based steering vectors requires\ninvasive runtime access to model internals, precluding deployment with\nAPI-based services and closed-source models. Finding steering methods that\ntransfer across multiple VLMs is still an open area of research. To this end,\nwe introduce universal visual input based steering for output redirection\n(VISOR++), to achieve behavioral control through optimized visual inputs alone.\nWe demonstrate that a single VISOR++ image can be generated for an ensemble of\nVLMs to emulate each of their steering vectors. By crafting universal visual\ninputs that induce target activation patterns, VISOR++ eliminates the need for\nruntime model access while remaining deployment-agnostic. This means that when\nan underlying model supports multimodal capability, model behaviors can be\nsteered by inserting an image input replacing runtime steering vector based\ninterventions. We first demonstrate the effectiveness of the VISOR++ images on\nopen-access models such as LLaVA-1.5-7B and IDEFICS2-8B along three alignment\ndirections: refusal, sycophancy and survival instinct.

This\nfragmentation contrasts sharply with clinical practice, where experts\nseamlessly integrate diverse knowledge: anatomical priors from training,\nexemplar-based reasoning from reference cases, and iterative refinement through\nreal-time interaction. We present $\\textbf{K-Prism}$, a unified segmentation\nframework that mirrors this clinical flexibility by systematically integrating\nthree knowledge paradigms: (i) $\\textit{semantic priors}$ learned from\nannotated datasets, (ii) $\\textit{in-context knowledge}$ from few-shot\nreference examples, and (iii) $\\textit{interactive feedback}$ from user inputs\nlike clicks or scribbles. Our key insight is that these heterogeneous knowledge\nsources can be encoded into a dual-prompt representation: 1-D sparse prompts\ndefining $\\textit{what}$ to segment and 2-D dense prompts indicating\n$\\textit{where}$ to attend, which are then dynamically routed through a\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE) decoder.

When it comes\nto scene reconstruction, this human perception trait calls for spatially\nvarying degrees of detail ready for closer inspection in critical regions,\npreferably reconstructed on demand. While recent works in 3D Gaussian Splatting\n(3DGS) achieve fast, generalizable reconstruction from sparse views, their\nuniform resolution output leads to high computational costs unscalable to\nhigh-resolution training. As a result, they cannot leverage available images at\ntheir original high resolution to reconstruct details.

To bridge the gap between\nthe prohibitive cost of high-resolution holistic reconstructions and the user\nneeds for localized fine details, we propose the problem of localized\nhigh-resolution reconstruction via on-demand Gaussian densification. Given a\nlow-resolution 3DGS reconstruction, the goal is to learn a generalizable\nnetwork that densifies the initial 3DGS to capture fine details in a\nuser-specified local region of interest (RoI), based on sparse high-resolution\nobservations of the RoI.

While generative models in other domains exhibit well-established scaling\nlaws, our work reveals that SID-based GR shows significant bottlenecks while\nscaling up the model. In particular, the performance of SID-based GR quickly\nsaturates as we enlarge each component: the modality encoder, the quantization\ntokenizer, and the RS itself. In this work, we identify the limited capacity of\nSIDs to encode item semantic information as one of the fundamental bottlenecks.\nMotivated by this observation, as an initial effort to obtain GR models with\nbetter scaling behaviors, we revisit another GR paradigm that directly uses\nlarge language models (LLMs) as recommenders (henceforth, LLM-as-RS).

To address this, we present\nProbabilistic Modality-Enhanced Diagnosis (ProbMED), a multimodal Med-VLPM that\nemploys probabilistic contrastive learning to model distributions over\nembeddings rather than deterministic estimates. ProbMED aligns four distinct\nmodalities -- chest X-rays, electrocardiograms, echocardiograms, and clinical\ntext -- into a unified probabilistic embedding space. We use InfoNCE loss with\nHellinger distance to integrate inter-modality distributions. We introduce a\nprobabilistic synthetic sampling loss that captures modality-specific mean and\nvariance to improve intra-modality binding. Extensive experiments across 13\nmedical datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms current Med-VLPMs in\ncross-modality retrieval, zero-shot, and few-shot classification. We also\ndemonstrate the robust integration of multiple modalities for prognostication,\nshowing improved intra- and inter-medical modality binding."}

One particular difficulty to\novercome is when regions of the cost map switch between being marked as\nobstacles and free space through successive planning cycles. One potential\nsolution to this, which we refer to as Valid in Every Hypothesis (VEH), is for\nthe planning system to plan motions that are guaranteed to be safe through a\nhistory of world models. Another approach is to track a history of world\nmodels, and adjust node costs according to the potential penalty of needing to\nreroute around previously hazardous areas. This work discusses three major\niterations on this idea. The first iteration, called PEH, invokes a sub-search\nfor every node expansion that crosses through a divergence point in the world\nmodels. The second and third iterations, called GEH and GEGRH respectively,\ndefer the sub-search until after an edge expands into the goal region.

In this work, we introduce a novel framework, DECS, built on our\ntheoretical discovery of two previously unaddressed flaws in current length\nrewards: (1) the erroneous penalization of essential exploratory tokens and (2)\nthe inadvertent rewarding of partial redundancy. Our framework's innovations\ninclude (i) a first-of-its-kind decoupled token-level reward mechanism that\nsurgically distinguishes and penalizes redundant tokens, and (ii) a novel\ncurriculum batch scheduling strategy to master the efficiency-efficacy\nequilibrium. Experimental results show DECS can achieve a dramatic reduction in\nreasoning tokens by over 50\\% across seven benchmarks while simultaneously\nmaintaining or even improving performance.

These methods,\nhowever, either rely directly on paired image preference data or require a\nlearned reward function, both of which depend heavily on costly, high-quality\nhuman annotations and thus face scalability limitations. In this work, we\nintroduce Text Preference Optimization (TPO), a framework that enables\n\"free-lunch\" alignment of T2I models, achieving alignment without the need for\npaired image preference data. TPO works by training the model to prefer matched\nprompts over mismatched prompts, which are constructed by perturbing original\ncaptions using a large language model. Our framework is general and compatible\nwith existing preference-based algorithms. We extend both DPO and KTO to our\nsetting, resulting in TDPO and TKTO.

However, offering users verification of their data\nremoval post-unlearning is an important yet under-explored problem. Current\nverifications typically rely on backdooring, i.e., adding backdoored samples to\ninfluence model performance. Nevertheless, the backdoor methods can merely\nestablish a connection between backdoored samples and models but fail to\nconnect the backdoor with genuine samples. Thus, the backdoor removal can only\nconfirm the unlearning of backdoored samples, not users' genuine samples, as\ngenuine samples are independent of backdoored ones.

First, embedding\nthe seeds into the service model while keeping them secret from the server\nrequires a sophisticated approach. We address this by employing a\nself-supervised model seeding task, which learns the entire sample, including\nthe seeds, into the model's latent space. Second, maintaining the utility of\nthe original service model while ensuring the seeding effect requires a\ndelicate balance. We design a joint-training structure that optimizes both the\nself-supervised model seeding task and the primary service task simultaneously\non the model, thereby maintaining model utility while achieving effective model\nseeding.

To\nleverage these advancements in the domain of time series, we introduce Time\nSeries JEPA (TS-JEPA), an architecture specifically adapted for time series\nrepresentation learning.

When these roles are filled by smaller LLMs, performance degrades.\nImportantly, BN-SC does not require LLMs in domains with deterministic action\nspaces, where clustering can be done programmatically. We also provide a\ntheoretical guarantee that BN-DP never increases LLM invocations relative to\nthe baseline and release a unified implementation of CiT across ToT-BS,\nReST-MCTS, and RAP to facilitate reproducibility and extension."}

This strategy adaptively\ndiscovers optimal control orders, ultimately producing summaries that\neffectively meet all constraints. Extensive experiments across diverse domains\nand models demonstrate that PACO achieves robust multi-attribute\ncontrollability, surpassing both LLM-based self-planning models and fine-tuned\nbaselines. Remarkably, PACO with Llama-3.2-1B rivals the controllability of the\nmuch larger Llama-3.3-70B baselines. With larger models, PACO achieves superior\ncontrol performance, outperforming all competitors."}

However, existing approaches\noften underutilize the linguistic intelligence of these models, typically\nfailing to leverage their powerful instruction-following capabilities. This\nlimitation hinders the model's ability to follow text instructions for\ncontrollable Text-to-Speech~(TTS). To address this, we propose a new paradigm\ninspired by ``operationalism'' that decouples instruction understanding from\nspeech generation. We introduce BatonVoice, a framework where an LLM acts as a\n``conductor'', understanding user instructions and generating a textual\n``plan'' -- explicit vocal features (e.g., pitch, energy). A separate TTS\nmodel, the ``orchestra'', then generates the speech from these features. To\nrealize this component, we develop BatonTTS, a TTS model trained specifically\nfor this task. Our experiments demonstrate that BatonVoice achieves strong\nperformance in controllable and emotional speech synthesis, outperforming\nstrong open- and closed-source baselines. Notably, our approach enables\nremarkable zero-shot cross-lingual generalization, accurately applying feature\ncontrol abilities to languages unseen during post-training. This demonstrates\nthat objectifying speech into textual vocal features can more effectively\nunlock the linguistic intelligence of LLMs."}

To unlock learning from these hard samples,\nwe propose NuRL, a \"nudging\" method that aims to push the upper bound of LLM\nreasoning using self-generated hints, i.e., abstract cues that help reduce the\nproblem difficulty for the model.

We introduce\nautonomy-aware clustering, a reinforcement (RL) learning framework that learns\nand accounts for the influence of local autonomy without requiring prior\nknowledge of its form. Our approach integrates RL with a deterministic\nannealing (DA) procedure, where, to determine underlying clusters, DA naturally\npromotes exploration in early stages of annealing and transitions to\nexploitation later.

Beyond the spurious dependencies induced by\nlatent confounders, we highlight a common yet often overlooked challenge in the\nproblem due to post-treatment selection, in which samples are selectively\nincluded in datasets after interventions. This fundamental challenge widely\nexists in biological studies; for example, in gene expression analysis, both\nobservational and interventional samples are retained only if they meet quality\ncontrol criteria (e.g., highly active cells). Neglecting post-treatment\nselection may introduce spurious dependencies and distributional changes under\ninterventions, which can mimic causal responses, thereby distorting causal\ndiscovery results and challenging existing causal formulations. To address\nthis, we introduce a novel causal formulation that explicitly models\npost-treatment selection and reveals how its differential reactions to\ninterventions can distinguish causal relations from selection patterns,\nallowing us to go beyond traditional equivalence classes toward the underlying\ntrue causal structure. We then characterize its Markov properties and propose a\nFine-grained Interventional equivalence class, named FI-Markov equivalence,\nrepresented by a new graphical diagram, F-PAG.

Since large\nlanguage models (LLMs) lack sentience - and themselves disclaim having selfhood\nor identity - one anticipated benefit is that they will be protected from, and\nin turn protect us from, distortions in our decisions. Yet, across 5 studies\nand ~20,000 queries, we discovered massive self-preferences in four widely used\nLLMs. In word-association tasks, models overwhelmingly paired positive\nattributes with their own names, companies, and CEOs relative to those of their\ncompetitors. Strikingly, when models were queried through APIs this\nself-preference vanished, initiating detection work that revealed API models\noften lack clear recognition of themselves. This peculiar feature\nserendipitously created opportunities to test the causal link between\nself-recognition and self-love. By directly manipulating LLM identity - i.e.,\nexplicitly informing LLM1 that it was indeed LLM1, or alternatively, convincing\nLLM1 that it was LLM2 - we found that self-love consistently followed assigned,\nnot true, identity. Importantly, LLM self-love emerged in consequential\nsettings beyond word-association tasks, when evaluating job candidates,\nsecurity software proposals and medical chatbots. Far from bypassing this human\nbias, self-love appears to be deeply encoded in LLM cognition. This result\nraises questions about whether LLM behavior will be systematically influenced\nby self-preferential tendencies, including a bias toward their own operation\nand even their own existence. We call on corporate creators of these models to\ncontend with a significant rupture in a core promise of LLMs - neutrality in\njudgment and decision-making."}

The key\ntechnical innovations include: (i) a retrieval-based pipeline extracting\nhigh-level motion features using video encoder and specialized resamplers to\ndistill semantic motion representations; (ii) an in-context learning approach\nfor motion adaptation implemented through a causal transformer architecture;\n(iii) an attention-based motion injection adapter that seamlessly integrates\ntransferred motion features into pretrained video diffusion models. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements\nacross multiple domains and various base models, all with negligible\ncomputational overhead during inference. Furthermore, our modular design\nenables zero-shot generalization to new domains by simply updating the\nretrieval database without retraining any components. This research enhances\nthe core capability of video generation systems by enabling the effective\nretrieval and transfer of motion priors, facilitating the synthesis of\nrealistic motion dynamics."}

In this study,\nwe develop a generalization error bound that possesses a certified robust\nradius for the smoothed majority vote classifier (i.e., the $Q$-weighted\nmajority vote classifier with smoothed inputs); In other words, the\ngeneralization bound holds under any data perturbation within the certified\nrobust radius. As a byproduct, we find that the underpinnings of both the\ngeneralization bound and the certified robust radius draw, in part, upon weight\nspectral norm, which thereby inspires the adoption of spectral regularization\nin smooth training to boost certified robustness. Utilizing the\ndimension-independent property of spherical Gaussian inputs in smooth training,\nwe propose a novel and inexpensive spectral regularizer to enhance the smoothed\nmajority vote classifier.

The perceptual losses operate in a latent feature space defined by a\npretrained encoder and aim to preserve semantic content by comparing high-level\nfeatures rather than raw pixel values. However, the design of perceptual losses\ninvolves critical yet underexplored decisions, including the feature\nrepresentation level, the dataset used to pretrain the encoder, and the\nrelative importance assigned to the perceptual component during optimization.\nIn this work, we introduce the concept of perceptual influence (a metric that\nquantifies the relative contribution of the perceptual loss term to the total\nloss) and propose a principled framework to assess the impact of the loss\ndesign choices on the model training performance.

To address this, we propose\nDiffCamera, a model that enables flexible refocusing of a created image\nconditioned on an arbitrary new focus point and a blur level.

Motivated by this associative memory view,\nwe then explain Muon's superiority on real-world corpora, which are\nintrinsically heavy-tailed: a few classes (tail classes) appear far less\nfrequently than others. The superiority is explained through two key\nproperties: (i) its update rule consistently yields a more isotropic singular\nspectrum than Adam; and as a result, (ii) on heavy-tailed data, it optimizes\ntail classes more effectively than Adam. Beyond empirical evidence, we\ntheoretically confirm these findings by analyzing a one-layer associative\nmemory model under class-imbalanced data.

First, as a safety dial:\nby evaluating more terms, developers and regulators can \"buy\" stronger\nguardrails from the same model. Second, as an adaptive cascade: clear cases\nexit early after low-order checks, and higher-order guardrails are evaluated\nonly for ambiguous inputs, reducing overall monitoring costs. On two\nlarge-scale safety datasets (WildGuardMix and BeaverTails), for 4 models with\nup to 30B parameters, we show that TPCs compete with or outperform MLP-based\nprobe baselines of the same size, all the while being more interpretable than\ntheir black-box counterparts.

Since large\nlanguage models (LLMs) lack sentience - and themselves disclaim having selfhood\nor identity - one anticipated benefit is that they will be protected from, and\nin turn protect us from, distortions in our decisions. Yet, across 5 studies\nand ~20,000 queries, we discovered massive self-preferences in four widely used\nLLMs. In word-association tasks, models overwhelmingly paired positive\nattributes with their own names, companies, and CEOs relative to those of their\ncompetitors. Strikingly, when models were queried through APIs this\nself-preference vanished, initiating detection work that revealed API models\noften lack clear recognition of themselves. This peculiar feature\nserendipitously created opportunities to test the causal link between\nself-recognition and self-love. By directly manipulating LLM identity - i.e.,\nexplicitly informing LLM1 that it was indeed LLM1, or alternatively, convincing\nLLM1 that it was LLM2 - we found that self-love consistently followed assigned,\nnot true, identity. Importantly, LLM self-love emerged in consequential\nsettings beyond word-association tasks, when evaluating job candidates,\nsecurity software proposals and medical chatbots. Far from bypassing this human\nbias, self-love appears to be deeply encoded in LLM cognition. This result\nraises questions about whether LLM behavior will be systematically influenced\nby self-preferential tendencies, including a bias toward their own operation\nand even their own existence. We call on corporate creators of these models to\ncontend with a significant rupture in a core promise of LLMs - neutrality in\njudgment and decision-making."}

AC-RL improves average accuracy by 4.4\npoints over pretrained baselines across seven visual mathematical reasoning\nbenchmarks, and analysis shows it would cut clarification requests by up to 39%\nif those were allowed.

This dependence, which can manifest itself even as\nsimple correlations, undermines the misconception that these sets can be\nindependently manipulated during unlearning. We provide empirical and\ntheoretical evidence showing these methods often fail precisely due to this\noverlooked relationship. For random forget sets, this dependence means that\ndegrading forget set metrics (which, for a retrained model, should mirror test\nset metrics) inevitably harms overall test performance. Going beyond random\nsets, we consider logistic regression as an instructive example where a\ncritical failure mode emerges: inter-set dependence causes gradient\ndescent-ascent iterations to progressively diverge from the ideal retrained\nmodel. Strikingly, these methods can converge to solutions that are not only\nfar from the retrained ideal but are potentially even further from it than the\noriginal model itself, rendering the unlearning process actively detrimental. A\ntoy example further illustrates how this dependence can trap models in inferior\nlocal minima, inescapable via finetuning. Our findings highlight that the\npresence of such statistical dependencies, even when manifest only as\ncorrelations, can be sufficient for ascent-based unlearning to fail.

This paper presents the first systematic investigation\nchallenging the fixed block size assumption in semi-AR decoding. Through a\nstatistical analysis of confidence dynamics during the denoising process, we\nidentify a volatility band (VB) region during dLLM decoding, which encodes\nlocal semantic structure and can be used to guide adaptive block sizing.\nLeveraging these insights, we introduce AdaBlock-dLLM, a training-free,\nplug-and-play scheduler that adaptively aligns block boundaries with semantic\nsteps by adjusting block size during runtime. Extensive experiments across\ndiverse benchmarks show that AdaBlock-dLLM achieves up to 5.3% accuracy\nimprovement under the same throughput budget.

Existing benchmarks primarily probe surface-level\nsemantic correspondence (e.g., object-text matching) while failing to assess\nthe deeper reasoning required to capture complex relationships between visual\nand textual information. To address this gap, we introduce MR$^2$-Bench, a\nreasoning-intensive benchmark for multimodal retrieval. MR$^2$-Bench presents\nthe following critical values: 1) all tasks are reasoning-driven, going beyond\nshallow matching to effectively assess models' capacity for logical, spatial,\nand causal inference; 2) it features diverse multimodal data, such as natural\nimages, diagrams, and visual puzzles, enabling comprehensive evaluation across\ncontent types; 3) it supports complex queries and documents containing multiple\nimages and covers diverse retrieval scenarios, more accurately reflecting\nreal-world applications. Our benchmark contains 1,309 curated queries, derived\neither from manual collection and annotation or from selective consolidation of\npublic datasets. Despite achieving strong results on existing benchmarks,\ncurrent state-of-the-art models still struggle on MR$^2$-Bench: for example,\nthe leading Seed1.6-Embedding model attains a Recall@1 of 77.78 on MMEB, but\nonly 9.91 on MR$^2$-Bench.

Preparing computing students\nfor the new challenges of an AI-dominated technology industry is therefore a\nkey priority for the CS curriculum.\n  In this discussion paper, we seek to articulate a framework for integrating\ndiscussions on the nascent AI policy landscape into computer science courses.\nWe begin by summarizing recent AI policy efforts in the United States and\nEuropean Union. Subsequently, we propose guiding questions to frame class\ndiscussions around AI policy in technical and non-technical (e.g., ethics) CS\ncourses. Throughout, we emphasize the connection between normative policy\ndemands and still-open technical challenges relating to their implementation\nand enforcement through code and governance structures. This paper therefore\nrepresents a valuable contribution towards bridging research and discussions\nacross the areas of AI policy and CS education, underlining the need to prepare\nAI engineers to interact with and adapt to societal policy preferences."}

We address\nthese questions by analyzing the hidden states at the core of transformer\ncomputations, which capture intermediate results and act as carriers of\ninformation.

Recent work has primarily focused on\nimproving faithfulness, defined as semantic alignment with supporting\ndocuments, which can cause models to rely excessively on external sources and\ndiminish their capacity for critical assessment. To address this, we propose\nthe Thinking-supervised Reward Model (TRM), which incorporates sentence-level\nthinking supervision to endow reward models with critical thinking abilities.\nGiven a query, answer, and supporting documents, TRM first assesses the\nfaithfulness of each answer sentence to the supporting documents, and then\napplies a reasoning step to evaluate sentence-level correctness. By structuring\nreward modeling as a sequence of faithfulness, reasoning, and correctness\nevaluations, TRM encourages models to critically assess and leverage both\nexternal and internal knowledge. Experiments on reward signals demonstrate that\nTRM substantially improves the identification of incorrect sentences, and\nincorporating TRM into policy optimization leads to significant gains in both\nanswer correctness and usefulness."}

However, the Hamiltonian matrix is both\nnumerically difficult to predict and intrinsically non-transferable, hindering\nthe application of such models in real scenarios. In light of this, we propose\na method that constructs DFT initial guesses by predicting the electron density\nin a compact auxiliary basis representation using E(3)-equivariant neural\nnetworks. Trained on small molecules with up to 20 atoms, our model is able to\nachieve an average 33.3% self-consistent field (SCF) step reduction on systems\nup to 60 atoms, substantially outperforming Hamiltonian-centric and DM-centric\nmodels. Critically, this acceleration remains nearly constant with increasing\nsystem sizes and exhibits strong transferring behaviors across orbital basis\nsets and exchange-correlation (XC) functionals. To the best of our knowledge,\nthis work represents the first and robust candidate for a universally\ntransferable DFT acceleration method. We are also releasing the SCFbench\ndataset and its accompanying code to facilitate future research in this\npromising direction."}

Building on these advancements, diffusion\nmodels have also demonstrated exceptional performance in text-guided image\nediting. A key strategy for effective image editing involves inverting the\nsource image into editable noise maps associated with the target image.\nHowever, previous inversion methods face challenges in adhering closely to the\ntarget text prompt. The limitation arises because inverted noise maps, while\nenabling faithful reconstruction of the source image, restrict the flexibility\nneeded for desired edits. To overcome this issue, we propose Editable Noise Map\nInversion (ENM Inversion), a novel inversion technique that searches for\noptimal noise maps to ensure both content preservation and editability. We\nanalyze the properties of noise maps for enhanced editability. Based on this\nanalysis, our method introduces an editable noise refinement that aligns with\nthe desired edits by minimizing the difference between the reconstructed and\nedited noise maps.

Our analysis reveals that while\nLLMs, such as LLaMA3-8b, Flan-T5, and SBERT, demonstrate impressive\ncapabilities in various natural language processing tasks, they do not\nsignificantly outperform small proprietary models in the specific context of\nfinancial transaction understanding. This phenomenon is particularly evident in\nterms of speed and cost efficiency. Proprietary models, tailored to the unique\nrequirements of transaction data, exhibit faster processing times and lower\noperational costs, making them more suitable for real-time applications in the\nfinancial sector. Our findings highlight the importance of model selection\nbased on domain-specific needs and underscore the potential advantages of\ncustomized proprietary models over general-purpose LLMs in specialized\napplications. Ultimately, we chose to implement a proprietary decoder-only\nmodel to handle the complex transactions that we previously couldn't manage.\nThis model can help us to improve 14% transaction coverage, and save more than\n\\$13 million annual cost."}

To\ntackle this challenge, we introduce a method to reduce both time and space\ncomplexity of these systems by proposing VRWKV-Editor, a novel video editing\nmodel that integrates a linear spatio-temporal aggregation module into\nvideo-based diffusion models. VRWKV-Editor leverages bidirectional weighted\nkey-value recurrence mechanism of the RWKV transformer to capture global\ndependencies while preserving temporal coherence, achieving linear complexity\nwithout sacrificing quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the\nproposed method achieves up to 3.7x speedup and 60% lower memory usage compared\nto state-of-the-art diffusion-based video editing methods, while maintaining\ncompetitive performance in frame consistency and text alignment.

To address this gap, we introduce an open-world logo recognition\nbenchmark, a core challenge in product moderation. Unlike traditional logo\nrecognition methods that rely on memorizing representations of tens of\nthousands of brands-an impractical approach in real-world settings-our proposed\nmethod, Logo-VGR, enables generalization to large-scale brand recognition with\nsupervision from only a small subset of brands. Specifically, we reformulate\nlogo recognition as a comparison-based task, requiring the model to match\nproduct images with candidate logos rather than directly generating brand\nlabels. We further observe that existing models tend to overfit by memorizing\nbrand distributions instead of learning robust multimodal reasoning, which\nresults in poor performance on unseen brands. To overcome this limitation,\nLogo-VGR introduces a new paradigm of domain-specific multimodal reasoning:\nLogo Perception Grounding injects domain knowledge, and Logo-Guided Visual\nGrounded Reasoning enhances the model's reasoning capability.

Current\ncode agent designs frequently depend on complex, hand-crafted workflows and\ntool sets. However, this reliance on elaborate scaffolding presents several\nchallenges: agent performance becomes overly dependent on prompt tuning and\ncustom design choices, heavy human intervention obscures a model's true\nunderlying capabilities, and intricate pipelines are costly to build and\nmaintain. Furthermore, optimizing complex task prompts increases the risk of\ndata leakage. Currently, when introducing new models, LLM providers like OpenAI\nand Anthropic often publish benchmark scores to demonstrate their models'\ncoding proficiency, but keep their proprietary evaluation frameworks\nconfidential. To address these limitations, we introduce Lita (Lite Agent),\nwhich operationalizes liteness, a principle of minimizing manual design while\nretaining the essential elements of a fully autonomous agent. Lita enables a\nmore faithful and unified evaluation without elaborate scaffolding. Experiments\non the Aider Polyglot and SWE-Bench with frontier models demonstrate that Lita\nachieves competitive or superior performance compared to workflow-based and\nagentic baselines.

This paper demystifies this mechanism through the lens of associative\nmemory. By ablating the transformer components optimized by Muon, we reveal\nthat the associative memory parameters of LLMs, namely the Value and Output\n(VO) attention weights and Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs), are the primary\ncontributors to Muon's superiority. Motivated by this associative memory view,\nwe then explain Muon's superiority on real-world corpora, which are\nintrinsically heavy-tailed: a few classes (tail classes) appear far less\nfrequently than others. The superiority is explained through two key\nproperties: (i) its update rule consistently yields a more isotropic singular\nspectrum than Adam; and as a result, (ii) on heavy-tailed data, it optimizes\ntail classes more effectively than Adam. Beyond empirical evidence, we\ntheoretically confirm these findings by analyzing a one-layer associative\nmemory model under class-imbalanced data. We prove that Muon consistently\nachieves balanced learning across classes regardless of feature embeddings,\nwhereas Adam can induce large disparities in learning errors depending on\nembedding properties. In summary, our empirical observations and theoretical\nanalyses reveal Muon's core advantage: its update rule aligns with the\nouter-product structure of linear associative memories, enabling more balanced\nand effective learning of tail classes in heavy-tailed distributions than Adam."}

For random forget sets, this dependence means that\ndegrading forget set metrics (which, for a retrained model, should mirror test\nset metrics) inevitably harms overall test performance. Going beyond random\nsets, we consider logistic regression as an instructive example where a\ncritical failure mode emerges: inter-set dependence causes gradient\ndescent-ascent iterations to progressively diverge from the ideal retrained\nmodel. Strikingly, these methods can converge to solutions that are not only\nfar from the retrained ideal but are potentially even further from it than the\noriginal model itself, rendering the unlearning process actively detrimental.

A recent example of such sharing,\nbetween commercial systems, is the 6 GHz band (5.925 - 7.125 GHz) where\nunlicensed, low-power-indoor (LPI) users share the band with outdoor\nincumbents, primarily fixed microwave links.

Another key issue is hallucination, where models generate plausible\nyet false information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a\nstrategy to mitigate hallucinations by combining external retrieval with text\ngeneration.

Through systematic analysis, we reveal that visual priors-the\nimplicit, emergent knowledge about the visual world acquired during language\npre-training-are composed of separable perception and reasoning priors with\nunique scaling trends and origins. We show that an LLM's latent visual\nreasoning ability is predominantly developed by pre-training on\nreasoning-centric data (e.g., code, math, academia) and scales progressively.\nThis reasoning prior acquired from language pre-training is transferable and\nuniversally applicable to visual reasoning.

To\naddress this, we introduce OmniRetarget, an interaction-preserving data\ngeneration engine based on an interaction mesh that explicitly models and\npreserves the crucial spatial and contact relationships between an agent, the\nterrain, and manipulated objects. By minimizing the Laplacian deformation\nbetween the human and robot meshes while enforcing kinematic constraints,\nOmniRetarget generates kinematically feasible trajectories. Moreover,\npreserving task-relevant interactions enables efficient data augmentation, from\na single demonstration to different robot embodiments, terrains, and object\nconfigurations. We comprehensively evaluate OmniRetarget by retargeting motions\nfrom OMOMO, LAFAN1, and our in-house MoCap datasets, generating over 8-hour\ntrajectories that achieve better kinematic constraint satisfaction and contact\npreservation than widely used baselines. Such high-quality data enables\nproprioceptive RL policies to successfully execute long-horizon (up to 30\nseconds) parkour and loco-manipulation skills on a Unitree G1 humanoid, trained\nwith only 5 reward terms and simple domain randomization shared by all tasks,\nwithout any learning curriculum."}

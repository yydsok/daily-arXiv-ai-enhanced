Using\nBayesian approximation analysis, we provide a simple and explicit form of the\nreserve price function tailored to the most representative network auction. We\naim to balance setting a sufficiently high reserve price to induce high revenue\nin a successful sale, and attracting more buyers from the network to increase\nthe probability of a successful sale. This reserve price function preserves\nincentive compatibility for network auctions, allowing the seller to extract\nadditional revenue beyond that achieved by the Myerson optimal auction.\nSpecifically, if the seller has $\\rho$ direct neighbours in a network of size\n$n$, this reserve price guarantees a $1-{1 \\over \\rho}$ approximation to the\ntheoretical upper bound, i.e., the maximum possible revenue from any network of\nsize $n$. This result holds for any size and any structure of the networked\nmarket."}

Traditional\npredictive models often rely on unimodal data or early fusion strategies that\nfail to capture the complex, multimodal nature of psychiatric data.

Methods: Using data from the BRIGHTEN\nclinical trial, we evaluated intermediate (latent space) fusion for predicting\ndaily depressive symptoms (PHQ-2 scores). We compared early fusion implemented\nwith a Random Forest (RF) model and intermediate fusion implemented via a\nCombined Model (CM) using autoencoders and a neural network.

This paper\nintroduces the concept of Predictive Representativity (PR), a framework of\nfairness auditing that shifts the focus from the composition of the data set to\noutcomes-level equity. Through a case study in dermatology, we evaluated\nAI-based skin cancer classifiers trained on the widely used HAM10000 dataset\nand on an independent clinical dataset (BOSQUE Test set) from Colombia. Our\nanalysis reveals substantial performance disparities by skin phototype, with\nclassifiers consistently underperforming for individuals with darker skin,\ndespite proportional sampling in the source data. We argue that\nrepresentativity must be understood not as a static feature of datasets but as\na dynamic, context-sensitive property of model predictions. PR operationalizes\nthis shift by quantifying how reliably models generalize fairness across\nsubpopulations and deployment contexts. We further propose an External\nTransportability Criterion that formalizes the thresholds for fairness\ngeneralization.

Simple parallel grippers often struggle with such tasks due to\nlimited dexterity and actuation constraints. Prior works have explored object\npose reorientation such as pivoting by utilizing extrinsic contacts between an\nobject and an environment feature like a wall, to make the object graspable.\nHowever, such works often assume the presence of a short wall, and this\nassumption may not always hold in real-world scenarios. If the wall available\nfor interaction is too large or too tall, the robot may still fail to grasp the\nobject even after pivoting, and the robot must combine different types of\nactions to grasp. To address this, we propose a hierarchical reinforcement\nlearning (RL) framework. We use Q-learning to train a high-level policy that\nselects the type of action expected to yield the highest reward. The selected\nlow-level skill then samples a specific robot action in continuous space. To\nguide the robot to an appropriate location for executing the selected action,\nwe adopt a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE). We condition the CVAE on\nthe object point cloud and the skill ID, enabling it to infer a suitable\nlocation based on the object geometry and the selected skill. To promote\ngeneralization, we apply domain randomization during the training of low-level\nskills. The RL policy is trained entirely in simulation with a box-like object\nand deployed to six objects in real world. We conduct experiments to evaluate\nour method and demonstrate both its generalizability and robust sim-to-real\ntransfer performance with promising success rates."}

Machine learning can reduce this burden, but only with\nenough context from the historical decisions made by the project team. That is,\nstate-of-the-art models, such as GPT2SP and FastText-SVM, only make accurate\npredictions (within-project) when trained on data from the same project. The\ngoal of this work is to streamline story point estimation by evaluating a\ncomparative learning-based framework for calibrating project-specific story\npoint prediction models. Instead of assigning a specific story point value to\nevery backlog item, developers are presented with pairs of items, and indicate\nwhich item requires more effort.

Unlike previous methods that rely only on 2D and 3D\nembeddings, Descrip3D enhances each object with a textual description that\ncaptures both its intrinsic attributes and contextual relationships. These\nrelational cues are incorporated into the model through a dual-level\nintegration: embedding fusion and prompt-level injection. This allows for\nunified reasoning across various tasks such as grounding, captioning, and\nquestion answering, all without the need for task-specific heads or additional\nsupervision. When evaluated on five benchmark datasets, including ScanRefer,\nMulti3DRefer, ScanQA, SQA3D, and Scan2Cap, Descrip3D consistently outperforms\nstrong baseline models, demonstrating the effectiveness of language-guided\nrelational representation for understanding complex indoor scenes."}

To\naddress this, we introduce the Causal Action Influence Score (CAIS), a novel\nintrinsic reward rooted in causal inference. CAIS quantifies an action's\ninfluence by measuring the 1-Wasserstein distance between the learned\ndistribution of sensory outcomes conditional on that action, $p(h|a)$, and the\nbaseline outcome distribution, $p(h)$. This divergence provides a robust reward\nthat isolates the agent's causal impact from confounding environmental noise.\nWe test our approach in a simulated infant-mobile environment where\ncorrelation-based perceptual rewards fail completely when the mobile is\nsubjected to external forces. In stark contrast, CAIS enables the agent to\nfilter this noise, identify its influence, and learn the correct policy.\nFurthermore, the high-quality predictive model learned for CAIS allows our\nagent, when augmented with a surprise signal, to successfully reproduce the\n\"extinction burst\" phenomenon. We conclude that explicitly inferring causality\nis a crucial mechanism for developing a robust sense of agency, offering a\npsychologically plausible framework for more adaptive autonomous systems."}

Existing HRI systems demonstrate great progress\nin interpreting and following user instructions, action generation, and robot\ntask solving. On the other hand, bi-directional, multi-modal, and context-aware\nsupport of the user in collaborative tasks still remains an open challenge. In\nthis paper, we present a gaze- and speech-informed interface to the assistive\nrobot, which is able to perceive the working environment from multiple vision\ninputs and support the dynamic user in their tasks. Our system is designed to\nbe modular and transferable to adapt to diverse tasks and robots, and it is\ncapable of real-time use of language-based interaction state representation and\nfast on board perception modules. Its development was supported by multiple\npublic dissemination events, contributing important considerations for improved\nrobustness and user experience. Furthermore, in two lab studies, we compare the\nperformance and user ratings of our system with those of a traditional scripted\nHRI pipeline. Our findings indicate that an LLM-based approach enhances\nadaptability and marginally improves user engagement and task execution metrics\nbut may produce redundant output, while a scripted pipeline is well suited for\nmore straightforward tasks."}

Batching allows managers to trade off cost and\nprocessing effort against waiting time. Larger and less frequent batches may\nlower costs by reducing processing effort and amortizing fixed costs, but they\ncreate longer waiting times. In contrast, smaller and more frequent batches\nreduce waiting times but increase fixed costs and processing effort. A batching\npolicy defines how activity instances are grouped into batches and when each\nbatch is activated. This paper addresses the problem of discovering batching\npolicies that strike optimal trade-offs between waiting time, processing\neffort, and cost. The paper proposes a Pareto optimization approach that starts\nfrom a given set (possibly empty) of activity batching policies and generates\nalternative policies for each batched activity via intervention heuristics.\nEach heuristic identifies an opportunity to improve an activity's batching\npolicy with respect to a metric (waiting time, processing time, cost, or\nresource utilization) and an associated adjustment to the activity's batching\npolicy (the intervention). The impact of each intervention is evaluated via\nsimulation. The intervention heuristics are embedded in an optimization\nmeta-heuristic that triggers interventions to iteratively update the Pareto\nfront of the interventions identified so far. The paper considers three\nmeta-heuristics: hill-climbing, simulated annealing, and reinforcement\nlearning. An experimental evaluation compares the proposed approach based on\nintervention heuristics against the same (non-heuristic guided) meta-heuristics\nbaseline regarding convergence, diversity, and cycle time gain of\nPareto-optimal policies."}

Recently developed foundational models\nfor 3D reconstruction, such as Dense and Unconstrained Stereo 3D Reconstruction\n(DUSt3R), Matching and Stereo 3D Reconstruction (MASt3R), and Visual Geometry\nGrounded Transformer (VGGT), have attracted attention due to their ability to\nhandle very sparse image overlaps. Evaluating DUSt3R/MASt3R/VGGT on typical\naerial images matters, as these models may handle extremely low image overlaps,\nstereo occlusions, and textureless regions. For redundant collections, they can\naccelerate 3D reconstruction by using extremely sparsified image sets. Despite\ntests on various computer vision benchmarks, their potential on photogrammetric\naerial blocks remains unexplored. This paper conducts a comprehensive\nevaluation of the pre-trained DUSt3R/MASt3R/VGGT models on the aerial blocks of\nthe UseGeo dataset for pose estimation and dense 3D reconstruction. Results\nshow these methods can accurately reconstruct dense point clouds from very\nsparse image sets (fewer than 10 images, up to 518 pixels resolution), with\ncompleteness gains up to +50% over COLMAP. VGGT also demonstrates higher\ncomputational efficiency, scalability, and more reliable camera pose\nestimation.

This study presents a theoretical and empirical\ninvestigation that provides fresh insights into the potential limits of RLVR.\nFirst, we offer a new theoretical perspective that RLVR is constrained by the\nbase model's support-unable to sample solutions with zero initial\nprobability-and operates as a conservative reweighting mechanism that may\nrestrict the discovery of entirely original solutions. We also identify an\nentropy-reward tradeoff: while RLVR reliably enhances precision, it may\nprogressively narrow exploration and potentially overlook correct yet\nunderrepresented solutions. Extensive empirical experiments validate that while\nRLVR consistently improves pass@1, the shrinkage of empirical support generally\noutweighs the expansion of empirical support under larger sampling budgets,\nfailing to recover correct answers that were previously accessible to the base\nmodel. Interestingly, we also observe that while RLVR sometimes increases\ntoken-level entropy, resulting in greater uncertainty at each generation step,\nanswer-level entropy declines, indicating that these seemingly more uncertain\npaths ultimately converge onto a smaller set of distinct answers. Taken\ntogether, these findings reveal potential limits of RLVR in extending reasoning\nhorizons.

In contrast, humans\ntypically engage in complex mental reasoning internally, enabling them to\ncommunicate ideas clearly and concisely. Thus, integrating an unspoken thought\nprocess into SLMs is highly desirable. While naively generating a complete\nchain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning before starting to talk can enable thinking\nfor SLMs, this induces additional latency for the speech response, as the CoT\nreasoning can be arbitrarily long. To solve this issue, we propose Stitch, a\nnovel generation method that alternates between the generation of unspoken\nreasoning chunks and spoken response chunks. Since the audio duration of a\nchunk of spoken response is much longer than the time to generate the tokens in\na chunk of spoken response, we use the remaining free time to generate the\nunspoken reasoning tokens. When a chunk of audio is played to the user, the\nmodel continues to generate the next unspoken reasoning chunk, achieving\nsimultaneous thinking and talking. Remarkably, Stitch matches the latency of\nbaselines that cannot generate unspoken CoT by design while outperforming those\nbaselines by 15% on math reasoning datasets; Stitch also performs equally well\non non-reasoning datasets as those baseline models.

We present an approach for pose estimation in cryo-EM that\nleverages multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) techniques in a robust manner to\nestimate the 3D rotation matrix of each particle from pairs of dihedral angles.\nWe express the rotation matrix in the form of an axis of rotation and a unit\nvector in the plane perpendicular to the axis. The technique leverages the\nconcept of common lines in 3D reconstruction from projections. However, common\nline estimation is ridden with large errors due to the very low SNR of cryo-EM\nprojection images. To address this challenge, we introduce two complementary\ncomponents: (i) a robust joint optimization framework for pose estimation based\non an $\\ell_1$-norm objective or a similar robust norm, which simultaneously\nestimates rotation axes and in-plane vectors while exactly enforcing unit norm\nand orthogonality constraints via projected coordinate descent; and (ii) an\niterative shift correction algorithm that estimates consistent in-plane\ntranslations through a global least-squares formulation. While prior approaches\nhave leveraged such embeddings and common-line geometry for orientation\nrecovery, existing formulations typically rely on $\\ell_2$-based objectives\nthat are sensitive to noise, and enforce geometric constraints only\napproximately. These choices, combined with a sequential pipeline structure,\ncan lead to compounding errors and suboptimal reconstructions in low-SNR\nregimes. Our pipeline consistently outperforms prior methods in both Euler\nangle accuracy and reconstruction fidelity, as measured by the Fourier Shell\nCorrelation (FSC)."}

Particularly, ROBAD first leverages the transformer encoder\nblock to encode each post bidirectionally, thus building a post embedding to\ncapture the local information at the post level. Next, it adopts the\ntransformer decoder block to model the sequential pattern in the post\nembeddings by using the attention mechanism, which generates the sequence\nembedding to obtain the global information at the sequence level. Finally, to\nenrich the knowledge of the model, embeddings of modified sequences by mimicked\nattackers are fed into a contrastive-learning-enhanced classification layer for\nsequence prediction. In essence, by capturing the local and global information\n(i.e., the post and sequence information) and leveraging the mimicked behaviors\nof bad actors in training, ROBAD can be robust to adversarial attacks.\nExtensive experiments on Yelp and Wikipedia datasets show that ROBAD can\neffectively detect bad actors when under state-of-the-art adversarial attacks."}

Existing unlearning\ntools remain largely sample-oriented, and straightforward point deletion often\nleaves enough residual signal for downstream learners to recover the unwanted\ndomain. We introduce distributional unlearning, a data-centric, model-agnostic\nframework that asks: Given examples from an unwanted distribution and a\nretained distribution, what is the smallest set of points whose removal makes\nthe edited dataset far from the unwanted domain yet close to the retained one?\nUsing Kullback-Leibler divergence to quantify removal and preservation, we\nderive the exact Pareto frontier in the Gaussian case and prove that any model\nretrained on the edited data incurs log-loss shifts bounded by the divergence\nthresholds.

This paper proposes a robust and explainable DL-based beam\nalignment engine (BAE) for mmWave multiple-input multiple output (MIMO)\nsystems. The BAE uses received signal strength indicator (RSSI) measurements\nfrom wide beams to predict the best narrow beam, reducing the overhead of\nexhaustive beam sweeping. To overcome the challenge of real-world data\ncollection, this work leverages a site-specific digital twin (DT) to generate\nsynthetic channel data closely resembling real-world environments. A model\nrefinement via transfer learning is proposed to fine-tune the pre-trained model\nresiding in the DT with minimal real-world data, effectively bridging\nmismatches between the digital replica and real-world environments. To reduce\nbeam training overhead and enhance transparency, the framework uses deep\nShapley additive explanations (SHAP) to rank input features by importance,\nprioritizing key spatial directions and minimizing beam sweeping.

Second, a dual contrastive loss is introduced\nto mitigate model divergence caused by different data distributions, comprising\nlocal contrastive loss and global contrastive loss.

Studies\ninvestigating the use of reservoir computing as a language model remain sparse.\nIn this paper, we compare three distinct approaches for character-level\nlanguage modeling, two different reservoir computing approaches, where only an\noutput layer is trainable, and the well-known transformer-based architectures,\nwhich fully learn an attention-based sequence representation. We explore the\nperformance, computational cost and prediction accuracy for both paradigms by\nequally varying the number of trainable parameters for all models. Using a\nconsistent pipeline for all three approaches, we demonstrate that transformers\nexcel in prediction quality, whereas reservoir computers remain highly\nefficient reducing the training and inference speed.

We propose temporal basis function models (TBFMs) to\naddress these difficulties, and explore this approach in the context of\nexcitatory optogenetic stimulation. We demonstrate the ability of TBF models to\nprovide a single-trial, spatiotemporal forward prediction of the effect of\noptogenetic stimulation on local field potentials (LFPs) measured in two\nnon-human primates. We further use simulations to demonstrate the use of TBF\nmodels for closed-loop stimulation, driving neural activity towards target\npatterns. The simplicity of TBF models allow them to be sample efficient, rapid\nto train (2-4min), and low latency (0.2ms) on desktop CPUs. We demonstrate the\nmodel on 40 sessions of previously published excitatory optogenetic stimulation\ndata. For each session, the model required 15-20min of data collection to\nsuccessfully model the remainder of the session. It achieved a prediction\naccuracy comparable to a baseline nonlinear dynamical systems model that\nrequires hours to train, and superior accuracy to a linear state-space model.\nIn our simulations, it also successfully allowed a closed-loop stimulator to\ncontrol a neural circuit. Our approach begins to bridge the translational gap\nbetween complex AI-based approaches to modeling dynamical systems and the\nvision of using such forward prediction models to develop novel, clinically\nuseful closed-loop stimulation protocols."}

Third, we design a Dynamic Adversarial Repulsion Enhancement\nLoss (DARELoss) that dynamically adjusts the margins of ambiguous classes,\nfurther enhancing the model's ability to distinguish similar expressions. We\nfurther construct the first occlusion-oriented FER dataset to facilitate\nspecialized robustness analysis on various real-world occlusion conditions,\ndubbed Occlu-FER. Extensive experiments on both public benchmarks and Occlu-FER\ndemonstrate that our proposed ORSANet achieves SOTA recognition performance.\nCode is publicly available at https://github.com/Wenyuzhy/ORSANet-master."}

This study presents a theoretical and empirical\ninvestigation that provides fresh insights into the potential limits of RLVR.\nFirst, we offer a new theoretical perspective that RLVR is constrained by the\nbase model's support-unable to sample solutions with zero initial\nprobability-and operates as a conservative reweighting mechanism that may\nrestrict the discovery of entirely original solutions. We also identify an\nentropy-reward tradeoff: while RLVR reliably enhances precision, it may\nprogressively narrow exploration and potentially overlook correct yet\nunderrepresented solutions. Extensive empirical experiments validate that while\nRLVR consistently improves pass@1, the shrinkage of empirical support generally\noutweighs the expansion of empirical support under larger sampling budgets,\nfailing to recover correct answers that were previously accessible to the base\nmodel.

In RLHF for\nLMs, we first train an LM using supervised fine-tuning, sample pairs of\nresponses, obtain human feedback, and use the resulting data to train a reward\nmodel (RM). RL methods are then used to train the LM to maximize the reward\ngiven by the RM.

The mission-critical and\ntime-sensitive nature of these applications necessitates the design of\nlow-latency FL frameworks that guarantee high learning performance. In\npractice, achieving low-latency FL faces two challenges: the overhead of\ncomputing and transmitting high-dimensional model updates, and the\nheterogeneity in communication-and-computation (C$^2$) capabilities across\ndevices. To address these challenges, we propose a novel C$^2$-aware framework\nfor optimal batch-size control that minimizes end-to-end (E2E) learning latency\nwhile ensuring convergence. The framework is designed to balance a fundamental\nC$^2$ tradeoff as revealed through convergence analysis. Specifically,\nincreasing batch sizes improves the accuracy of gradient estimation in FL and\nthus reduces the number of communication rounds required for convergence, but\nresults in higher per-round latency, and vice versa. The associated problem of\nlatency minimization is intractable; however, we solve it by designing an\naccurate and tractable surrogate for convergence speed, with parameters fitted\nto real data.

However, the adaptation of ECG FMs to downstream\nscenarios with fewer available channels still has to be properly investigated.\nIn this work, we propose Self-DANA, a novel, easy-to-integrate solution that\nmakes self-supervised architectures adaptable to a reduced number of input\nchannels, ensuring resource efficiency and high performance. We also introduce\nRandom Lead Selection, a novel augmentation technique to pre-train models in a\nmore robust and channel-agnostic way. Our experimental results on five\nreduced-channel configurations demonstrate that Self-DANA significantly\nenhances resource efficiency while reaching state-of-the-art performance. It\nrequires up to 69.3% less peak CPU memory, 34.4% less peak GPU memory, about\n17% less average epoch CPU time, and about 24% less average epoch GPU time."}

In this paper, we propose VMask, a novel\nlabel privacy protection framework designed to defend against MC attack from\nthe perspective of layer masking. Our key insight is to disrupt the strong\ncorrelation between input data and intermediate outputs by applying the secret\nsharing (SS) technique to mask layer parameters in the attacker's model. We\ndevise a strategy for selecting critical layers to mask, reducing the overhead\nthat would arise from naively applying SS to the entire model. Moreover, VMask\nis the first framework to offer a tunable privacy budget to defenders, allowing\nfor flexible control over the levels of label privacy according to actual\nrequirements. We built a VFL system, implemented VMask on it, and extensively\nevaluated it using five model architectures and 13 datasets with different\nmodalities, comparing it to 12 other defense methods. The results demonstrate\nthat VMask achieves the best privacy-utility trade-off, successfully thwarting\nthe MC attack (reducing the label inference accuracy to a random guessing\nlevel) while preserving model performance (e.g., in Transformer-based model,\nthe averaged drop of VFL model accuracy is only 0.09%).

Specifically, a Kalman filter is employed\nfor accurate target state prediction, regularized zero-forcing is utilized to\nmitigate inter-user interference, and the Soft Actor-Critic algorithm is\napplied for training the DRL agent on continuous actions. The proposed\nframework adaptively balances the trade-offs between sensing accuracy and\ncommunication quality.

Steel\nsurfaces not only have defects of various sizes and shapes, which limit the\naccuracy of traditional image processing and detection methods in complex\nenvironments. However, traditional defect detection methods face issues of\ninsufficient accuracy and high miss-detection rates when dealing with small\ntarget defects. To address this issue, this study proposes a detection\nframework based on deep learning, specifically YOLOv9s, combined with the\nC3Ghost module, SCConv module, and CARAFE upsampling operator, to improve\ndetection accuracy and model performance. First, the SCConv module is used to\nreduce feature redundancy and optimize feature representation by reconstructing\nthe spatial and channel dimensions. Second, the C3Ghost module is introduced to\nenhance the model's feature extraction ability by reducing redundant\ncomputations and parameter volume, thereby improving model efficiency. Finally,\nthe CARAFE upsampling operator, which can more finely reorganize feature maps\nin a content-aware manner, optimizes the upsampling process and ensures\ndetailed restoration of high-resolution defect regions.

Diffusion models are commonly\nused for data augmentation, but the existing methods face two challenges.\nFirst, due to the high concealment of lesions, it is difficult for the model to\nlearn the features of the lesion area.

This study presents a theoretical and empirical\ninvestigation that provides fresh insights into the potential limits of RLVR.\nFirst, we offer a new theoretical perspective that RLVR is constrained by the\nbase model's support-unable to sample solutions with zero initial\nprobability-and operates as a conservative reweighting mechanism that may\nrestrict the discovery of entirely original solutions. We also identify an\nentropy-reward tradeoff: while RLVR reliably enhances precision, it may\nprogressively narrow exploration and potentially overlook correct yet\nunderrepresented solutions. Extensive empirical experiments validate that while\nRLVR consistently improves pass@1, the shrinkage of empirical support generally\noutweighs the expansion of empirical support under larger sampling budgets,\nfailing to recover correct answers that were previously accessible to the base\nmodel.

Recent works introduce the signed distance field (SDF) as an extra\ncontinuous representation to regularize the geometry defined by Gaussian\nprimitives. It improves the decomposition quality, at the cost of increasing\nmemory usage and complicating training. Unlike these works, we introduce a\ndiscretized SDF to represent the continuous SDF in a discrete manner by\nencoding it within each Gaussian using a sampled value.

This work explores whether a foundational\nsegmentation model can address label scarcity in the pixel-level vision task as\nan annotator for unlabeled images. Specifically, we investigate the efficacy of\nusing SEEM, a Segment Anything Model (SAM) variant fine-tuned for textual\ninput, to generate predictive masks for unlabeled data. To address the\nshortcomings of using SEEM-generated masks as supervision, we propose\nConformalSAM, a novel SSSS framework which first calibrates the foundation\nmodel using the target domain's labeled data and then filters out unreliable\npixel labels of unlabeled data so that only high-confidence labels are used as\nsupervision. By leveraging conformal prediction (CP) to adapt foundation models\nto target data through uncertainty calibration, ConformalSAM exploits the\nstrong capability of the foundational segmentation model reliably which\nbenefits the early-stage learning, while a subsequent self-reliance training\nstrategy mitigates overfitting to SEEM-generated masks in the later training\nstage.

While AI can increase productivity in some\nareas such as coding and administrative tasks, its utility is constrained by\nlimitations of existing AI models (e.g. hallucinations in literature reviews)\nand human systems (e.g. barriers to accessing datasets). Through examples of\nAI-generated epidemiological outputs, including fully AI-generated papers, we\ndemonstrate that recently developed agentic systems can now design and execute\nepidemiological analysis, albeit to varied quality (see\nhttps://github.com/edlowther/automated-epidemiology). Epidemiologists have new\nopportunities to empirically test and benchmark AI systems; realising the\npotential of AI will require two-way engagement between epidemiologists and\nengineers."}

While current detection methods show promise, their underlying\nmechanisms remain poorly understood, and the large sizes of their models make\nthem challenging to deploy in resource-limited environments. This study\ninvestigates the application of the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) to deepfake\ndetection, aiming to identify the key features crucial for recognizing\ndeepfakes. We examine how neural networks can be efficiently pruned while\nmaintaining high detection accuracy. Through extensive experiments with\nMesoNet, CNN-5, and ResNet-18 architectures on the OpenForensic and\nFaceForensics++ datasets, we find that deepfake detection networks contain\nwinning tickets, i.e., subnetworks, that preserve performance even at\nsubstantial sparsity levels. Our results indicate that MesoNet retains 56.2%\naccuracy at 80% sparsity on the OpenForensic dataset, with only 3,000\nparameters, which is about 90% of its baseline accuracy (62.6%). The results\nalso show that our proposed LTH-based iterative magnitude pruning approach\nconsistently outperforms one-shot pruning methods.

We\nconduct a systematic evaluation by training models on various combinations of\nprominent ToM datasets (HiToM, ExploreToM, FANToM) and testing for\ngeneralization on held-out datasets (e.g., OpenToM).

Semi-supervised\nsemantic segmentation (SSSS) has emerged as a solution to alleviate the\nlabeling burden by leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data through\nself-training techniques. Meanwhile, the advent of foundational segmentation\nmodels pre-trained on massive data, has shown the potential to generalize\nacross domains effectively. This work explores whether a foundational\nsegmentation model can address label scarcity in the pixel-level vision task as\nan annotator for unlabeled images. Specifically, we investigate the efficacy of\nusing SEEM, a Segment Anything Model (SAM) variant fine-tuned for textual\ninput, to generate predictive masks for unlabeled data. To address the\nshortcomings of using SEEM-generated masks as supervision, we propose\nConformalSAM, a novel SSSS framework which first calibrates the foundation\nmodel using the target domain's labeled data and then filters out unreliable\npixel labels of unlabeled data so that only high-confidence labels are used as\nsupervision. By leveraging conformal prediction (CP) to adapt foundation models\nto target data through uncertainty calibration, ConformalSAM exploits the\nstrong capability of the foundational segmentation model reliably which\nbenefits the early-stage learning, while a subsequent self-reliance training\nstrategy mitigates overfitting to SEEM-generated masks in the later training\nstage. Our experiment demonstrates that, on three standard benchmarks of SSSS,\nConformalSAM achieves superior performance compared to recent SSSS methods and\nhelps boost the performance of those methods as a plug-in."}

This limitation arises from their reliance on appearance\nmatching, neglecting the human-like conceptual understanding of objects that\nenables robust identification across temporal dynamics. Motivated by this gap,\nwe propose Segment Concept (SeC), a concept-driven segmentation framework that\nshifts from conventional feature matching to the progressive construction and\nutilization of high-level, object-centric representations.

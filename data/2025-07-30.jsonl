Empirical results\nindicate that such dialogic approaches-particularly those involving\nmixed-direction interactions combining top-down explanations with\nlearner-initiated questioning-significantly enhance the LLM's ability to\nacquire and apply new knowledge, outperforming both unidirectional\ninstructional methods and direct access to structured knowledge, formats\ntypically present in training datasets.\n  These findings suggest that integrating pedagogical and psychological\ninsights into AI and robot training can substantially improve post-training\nknowledge acquisition and response quality. This approach offers a\ncomplementary pathway to existing strategies like prompt engineering"}

Agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well\nin isolated tasks, yet struggle with higher-order cognition required for\nadaptive collaboration. Human teams achieve synergy not only through knowledge\nsharing, but also through recursive reasoning, structured critique, and the\nability to infer others' mental states. Current artificial systems lack these\nessential mechanisms, limiting their ability to engage in sophisticated\ncollective reasoning. This work explores cognitive processes that enable\neffective collaboration, focusing on adaptive theory of mind (ToM) and\nsystematic critical evaluation. We investigate three key questions. First, how\ndoes the ability to model others' perspectives enhance coordination and reduce\nredundant reasoning? Second, to what extent does structured critique improve\nreasoning quality by identifying logical gaps and mitigating biases? Third, the\ninterplay of these mechanisms can lead to emergent cognitive synergy, where the\ncollective intelligence of the system exceeds the sum of its parts. Through an\nempirical case study on complex decision making, we show that the integration\nof these cognitive mechanisms leads to more coherent, adaptive, and rigorous\nagent interactions.

There have been works\nthat extend the notion of legibility to sequential decision making, for\ndeterministic and for stochastic scenarios. However, these works focus on one\nagent interacting with one human, foregoing the benefits of having legible\ndecision making in teams of agents or in team configurations with humans. In\nthis work we propose an extension of legible decision-making to multi-agent\nsettings that improves the performance of agents working in collaboration. We\nshowcase the performance of legible decision making in team scenarios using our\nproposed extension in multi-agent benchmark scenarios. We show that a team with\na legible agent is able to outperform a team composed solely of agents with\nstandard optimal behaviour."}

The first method is based on converting a\nSudoku puzzle into its corresponding Satisfiability (SAT) problem. The first\nproposed metric is derived from SAT Clause Length Distribution which captures\nthe structural complexity of a Sudoku puzzle including the number of given\ndigits and the cells they are in. The second method simulates human Sudoku\nsolvers by intertwining four popular Sudoku strategies within a backtracking\nalgorithm called Nishio. The second metric is computed by counting the number\nof times Sudoku strategies are applied within the backtracking iterations of a\nrandomized Nishio. Using these two metrics, I analyze more than a thousand\nSudoku puzzles across five popular websites to characterize every difficulty\nlevel in each website. I evaluate the relationship between the proposed metrics\nand website-labeled difficulty levels using Spearman's rank correlation\ncoefficient, finding strong correlations for 4 out of 5 websites.

This rating system is capable of classifying both\nindividual puzzles and entire difficulty levels from the different Sudoku\nwebsites into three categories - Universal Easy, Universal Medium, and\nUniversal Hard - thereby enabling consistent difficulty mapping across Sudoku\nwebsites. The experimental results show that for 4 out of 5 Sudoku websites,\nthe universal classification aligns well with website-labeled difficulty\nlevels.

A remaining significant challenge\nin this task is structural fragmentation, which can adversely impact downstream\napplications. Existing methods primarily focus on designing various loss\nfunctions to constrain global topological structures. However, they often\noverlook local discontinuity regions, leading to suboptimal segmentation\nresults. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel Global-to-Local\nConnectivity Preservation (GLCP) framework that can simultaneously perceive\nglobal and local structural characteristics of tubular networks. Specifically,\nwe propose an Interactive Multi-head Segmentation (IMS) module to jointly learn\nglobal segmentation, skeleton maps, and local discontinuity maps, respectively.\nThis enables our model to explicitly target local discontinuity regions while\nmaintaining global topological integrity. In addition, we design a lightweight\nDual-Attention-based Refinement (DAR) module to further improve segmentation\nquality by refining the resulting segmentation maps. Extensive experiments on\nboth 2D and 3D datasets demonstrate that our GLCP achieves superior accuracy\nand continuity in tubular structure segmentation compared to several\nstate-of-the-art approaches.

In practical\nterms, it is the intelligent use of word order, figurative speech and\nlinguistic embellishments to enhance message delivery. Despite the volumes that\nhave been written about it and the high status accorded to it, there is no way\nto objectively know whether a speaker or writer has used Arabic rhetoric in a\ngiven text, to what extent, and why. There is no objective way to compare the\nuse of Arabic rhetoric across genres, authors or epochs. It is impossible to\nknow which of pre-Islamic poetry, Andalucian Arabic poetry, or modern literary\ngenres are richer in Arabic rhetoric. The aim of the current study was to\ndevise a way to measure the density of the literary devices which constitute\nArabic rhetoric in a given text, as a proxy marker for Arabic rhetoric itself.\nA comprehensive list of 84 of the commonest literary devices and their\ndefinitions was compiled. A system of identifying literary devices in texts was\nconstructed. A method of calculating the density of literary devices based on\nthe morpheme count of the text was utilised. Four electronic tools and an\nanalogue tool were created to support the calculation of an Arabic text's\nrhetorical literary device density, including a website and online calculator.\nAdditionally, a technique of reporting the distribution of literary devices\nused across the three sub-domains of Arabic rhetoric was created. The output of\nthis project is a working tool which can accurately report the density of\nArabic rhetoric in any Arabic text or speech."}

This hinders detectors\nfrom comprehensively perceiving the characteristics of the physical world. To\nalleviate this, we introduce a multi-task learning framework, Collaborative\nPerceiver (CoP), that leverages spatial occupancy as auxiliary information to\nmine consistent structural and conceptual similarities shared between 3D object\ndetection and occupancy prediction tasks, bridging gaps in spatial\nrepresentations and feature refinement. To this end, we first propose a\npipeline to generate dense occupancy ground truths incorporating local density\ninformation (LDO) for reconstructing detailed environmental information. Next,\nwe employ a voxel-height-guided sampling (VHS) strategy to distill fine-grained\nlocal features according to distinct object properties.

To tackle the first challenge, we\npropose ContextLoRA, a novel method that guides an LLM to learn the rich\nstructured context among IMAs by constructing a task dependency graph. We\npartition the learnable parameter matrix of neural layers for each IMA to\nfacilitate LLM composition. Then, we develop a step-by-step fine-tuning\nprocedure guided by task relations, including training, freezing, and masking\nphases. This allows the LLM to learn to reason among tasks for better\nadaptation, capturing the latent dependencies between tasks. For the second\nchallenge, we introduce ContextGear, a scheduling strategy to optimize the\ntraining procedure of ContextLoRA, aiming to minimize computational and\ncommunication costs through a strategic grouping mechanism. Experiments on\nthree benchmarks show the superiority of the proposed ContextLoRA and\nContextGear. Furthermore, we prototype our proposed paradigm on a real-world\nwireless testbed, demonstrating its practical applicability for various IMAs.\nWe will release our code to the community."}

This study investigates the extent to which\nLLMs capture cross-cultural differences and similarities in moral perspectives.\nSpecifically, we examine whether LLM outputs align with patterns observed in\ninternational survey data on moral attitudes. To this end, we employ three\ncomplementary methods: (1) comparing variances in moral scores produced by\nmodels versus those reported in surveys, (2) conducting cluster alignment\nanalyses to assess correspondence between country groupings derived from LLM\noutputs and survey data, and (3) directly probing models with comparative\nprompts using systematically chosen token pairs.

Sample complexity result of MOCHA algorithm reveals an\ninteresting dependency on $p_{\\min}$ in finding an $\\epsilon$-Pareto-stationary\nsolution, where $p_{\\min}$ denotes the minimum entry of a given weight vector\n$\\mathbf{p}$ in WC-scarlarization. By carefully choosing learning rates, the\nsample complexity for each exploration can be\n$\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\epsilon^{-2})$. Furthermore, simulation studies on a\nlarge KuaiRand offline dataset, show that the performance of MOCHA algorithm\nsignificantly outperforms other baseline MORL approaches."}

However, a fundamental challenge with pruning consists in optimally\nremoving redundancies without degrading performance. Most existing pruning\ntechniques overlook structural dependencies across feature maps within a layer,\nresulting in suboptimal pruning decisions. In this work, we introduce LinDeps,\na novel post-pruning method, i.e., a pruning method that can be applied on top\nof any pruning technique, which systematically identifies and removes redundant\nfilters via linear dependency analysis.

Our experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet with VGG and ResNet\nbackbones demonstrate that LinDeps improves compression rates of existing\npruning techniques while preserving performances, leading to a new state of the\nart in CNN pruning.

This transformation aligns embedding distributions in a\nway that minimises the impact of adversarial noise on decision boundaries,\nenhancing robustness without requiring adversarial examples or costly\ntraining-time augmentation. Evaluations on eight benchmark datasets show that\nour approach improves adversarial robustness while maintaining comparable\nbefore-attack accuracy to baselines, achieving a balanced trade-off between\nrobustness and generalisation."}

The goal of this paper is to unravel these\nissues and their connections to uncertainty quantification (UQ) by pursuing a\nline of reasoning motivated by diagnostics. In such settings, prevalence - i.e.\nthe fraction of elements in class - is often of inherent interest. Here we\nanalyze the many interpretations of prevalence to derive a level-set theory of\nclassification, which shows that certain types of self-consistent ML models are\nequivalent to class-conditional probability distributions. We begin by studying\nthe properties of binary Bayes optimal classifiers, recognizing that their\nboundary sets can be reinterpreted as level-sets of pairwise density ratios. By\nparameterizing Bayes classifiers in terms of the prevalence, we then show that\nthey satisfy important monotonicity and class-switching properties that can be\nused to deduce the density ratios without direct access to the boundary sets.\nMoreover, this information is sufficient for tasks such as constructing the\nmulticlass Bayes-optimal classifier and estimating inherent uncertainty in the\nclass assignments. In the multiclass case, we use these results to deduce\nnormalization and self-consistency conditions, the latter being equivalent to\nthe law of total probability for classifiers.

It is commonly\nbelieved to hinder generalization by encouraging verbatim memorization rather\nthan deeper understanding. This insight holds for even learning factual\nknowledge that inevitably requires a certain degree of memorization. In this\nwork, we demonstrate that LLMs can be trained to generalize from rote memorized\ndata. We introduce a two-phase memorize-then-generalize framework, where the\nmodel first rote memorizes factual subject-object associations using a\nsemantically meaningless token and then learns to generalize by fine-tuning on\na small set of semantically meaningful prompts. Extensive experiments over 8\nLLMs show that the models can reinterpret rote memorized data through the\nsemantically meaningful prompts, as evidenced by the emergence of structured,\nsemantically aligned latent representations between the two.

To address this issue, we introduce\nMNEME, Model diffiNg for Evaluating Mechanistic Effects, a lightweight\nframework for identifying these side effects using sparse model diffing. MNEME\ncompares base and fine-tuned models on task-agnostic data (for example, The\nPile, LMSYS-Chat-1M) without access to fine-tuning data to isolate behavioral\nshifts. Applied to five LLMs across three scenarios: WMDP knowledge unlearning,\nemergent misalignment, and benign fine-tuning, MNEME achieves up to 95 percent\naccuracy in predicting side effects, aligning with known benchmarks and\nrequiring no custom heuristics. Furthermore, we show that retraining on\nhigh-activation samples can partially reverse these effects.

Among these applications, fundus image analysis\npresents special challenges, including small lesion areas in certain fundus\ndiseases and subtle inter-disease differences, which can lead to reduced\nprediction accuracy and overfitting in the models. To address these challenges,\nthis paper proposes the Transformer-based model SwinECAT, which combines the\nShifted Window (Swin) Attention with the Efficient Channel Attention (ECA)\nAttention. SwinECAT leverages the Swin Attention mechanism in the Swin\nTransformer backbone to effectively capture local spatial structures and\nlong-range dependencies within fundus images.

As one\nbuilding block of this method, we propose a novel point-shifting mechanism to\nintroduce perturbations in point cloud data. Recently, AI has seen an\nexponential growth. Hence, it is important to understand the decision-making\nprocess of AI algorithms when they are applied in critical areas. Our work\nfocuses on explaining AI algorithms that classify point cloud data. An\nimportant aspect of the methods used for explaining AI algorithms is their\nability to produce explanations that are easy for humans to understand. This\nallows them to analyze the AI algorithms better and make appropriate decisions\nbased on that analysis. Therefore, in this work, we intend to generate\nmeaningful explanations that can be easily interpreted by humans. The point\ncloud data we consider represents 3D objects such as cars, guitars, and\nlaptops. We make use of point cloud segmentation models to generate\nexplanations for the working of classification models. The segments are used to\nintroduce perturbations into the input point cloud data and generate saliency\nmaps. The perturbations are introduced using the novel point-shifting mechanism\nproposed in this work which ensures that the shifted points no longer influence\nthe output of the classification algorithm. In contrast to previous methods,\nthe segments used by our method are meaningful, i.e. humans can easily\ninterpret the meaning of the segments. Thus, the benefit of our method over\nother methods is its ability to produce more meaningful saliency maps. We\ncompare our method with the use of classical clustering algorithms to generate\nexplanations. We also analyze the saliency maps generated for example inputs\nusing our method to demonstrate the usefulness of the method in generating\nmeaningful explanations."}

In this paper, we propose FedBAP, a novel defense\nframework for mitigating backdoor attacks in FL by reducing the model's\nreliance on backdoor triggers.

In this\npaper, we present a structured framework for understanding and building the\nAgentic Web. We trace its evolution from the PC and Mobile Web eras and\nidentify the core technological foundations that support this shift. Central to\nour framework is a conceptual model consisting of three key dimensions:\nintelligence, interaction, and economics. These dimensions collectively enable\nthe capabilities of AI agents, such as retrieval, recommendation, planning, and\ncollaboration. We analyze the architectural and infrastructural challenges\ninvolved in creating scalable agentic systems, including communication\nprotocols, orchestration strategies, and emerging paradigms such as the Agent\nAttention Economy. We conclude by discussing the potential applications,\nsocietal risks, and governance issues posed by agentic systems, and outline\nresearch directions for developing open, secure, and intelligent ecosystems\nshaped by both human intent and autonomous agent behavior.

Existing reconstruction methods, such as the CLEAN\nalgorithm or proximal optimisation approaches, are iterative in nature,\nnecessitating a large amount of compute. These methods either provide no\nuncertainty quantification or require large computational overhead to do so.\nLearned reconstruction methods have shown promise in providing efficient and\nhigh quality reconstruction. In this article we explore the use of generative\nneural networks that enable efficient approximate sampling of the posterior\ndistribution for high quality reconstructions with uncertainty quantification.\nOur RI-GAN framework, builds on the regularised conditional generative\nadversarial network (rcGAN) framework by integrating a gradient U-Net (GU-Net)\narchitecture - a hybrid reconstruction model that embeds the measurement\noperator directly into the network. This framework uses Wasserstein GANs to\nimprove training stability in combination with regularisation terms that combat\nmode collapse, which are typical problems for conditional GANs. This approach\ntakes as input the dirty image and the point spread function (PSF) of the\nobservation and provides efficient, high-quality image reconstructions that are\nrobust to varying visibility coverages, generalises to images with an increased\ndynamic range, and provides informative uncertainty quantification. Our methods\nprovide a significant step toward computationally efficient, scalable, and\nuncertainty-aware imaging for next-generation radio telescopes."}

Consequently, The validated technology terms by\nRATE were mapped into a co-occurrence network, revealing thematic clusters and\nstructural features of the research landscape. For the purpose of evaluation, a\ngold standard dataset of technologies in 70 selected random articles had been\ncurated by the experts. In addition, a technology extraction model based on\nBidirectional Encoder Representations of Transformers (BERT) was used as a\ncomparative method.

Motivated by these neurobiological insights, we\nintroduce the Engram Neural Network (ENN), a novel recurrent architecture\nincorporating an explicit, differentiable memory matrix with Hebbian plasticity\nand sparse, attention-driven retrieval mechanisms. The ENN explicitly models\nmemory formation and recall through dynamic Hebbian traces, improving\ntransparency and interpretability compared to conventional RNN variants. We\nevaluate the ENN architecture on three canonical benchmarks: MNIST digit\nclassification, CIFAR-10 image sequence modeling, and WikiText-103 language\nmodeling. Our empirical results demonstrate that the ENN achieves accuracy and\ngeneralization performance broadly comparable to classical RNN, GRU, and LSTM\narchitectures, with all models converging to similar accuracy and perplexity on\nthe large-scale WikiText-103 task.

Although\nmore sophisticated methods exist, they are often difficult to implement and\ntherefore not widely applied. In contrast, two recent approaches modify the\nregularization methods LASSO and elastic nets by defining a single loss\nfunction, resulting in a unified set of coefficients across imputations. Our\nkey contribution is to extend this principle to the framework of component-wise\ngradient boosting by proposing MIBoost, a novel algorithm that employs a\nuniform variable-selection mechanism across imputed datasets. Simulation\nstudies suggest that our approach yields prediction performance comparable to\nthat of these recently proposed methods."}

Among these applications, fundus image analysis\npresents special challenges, including small lesion areas in certain fundus\ndiseases and subtle inter-disease differences, which can lead to reduced\nprediction accuracy and overfitting in the models. To address these challenges,\nthis paper proposes the Transformer-based model SwinECAT, which combines the\nShifted Window (Swin) Attention with the Efficient Channel Attention (ECA)\nAttention. SwinECAT leverages the Swin Attention mechanism in the Swin\nTransformer backbone to effectively capture local spatial structures and\nlong-range dependencies within fundus images. The lightweight ECA mechanism is\nincorporated to guide the SwinECAT's attention toward critical feature\nchannels, enabling more discriminative feature representation. In contrast to\nprevious studies that typically classify fundus images into 4 to 6 categories,\nthis work expands fundus disease classification to 9 distinct types, thereby\nenhancing the granularity of diagnosis. We evaluate our method on the Eye\nDisease Image Dataset (EDID) containing 16,140 fundus images for 9-category\nclassification. Experimental results demonstrate that SwinECAT achieves 88.29\\%\naccuracy, with weighted F1-score of 0.88 and macro F1-score of 0.90. The\nclassification results of our proposed model SwinECAT significantly outperform\nthe baseline Swin Transformer and multiple compared baseline models.

While recent foundation models offer strong\npotential for time series forecasting, they often suffer from architectural\nrigidity and limited robustness under distributional change. In this paper, we\npropose a unified ensemble framework that enhances the performance of\nfoundation models for sales forecasting in real-world supply chains. Our method\ncombines two complementary strategies: (1) Hierarchical Ensemble (HE), which\npartitions training and inference by semantic levels (e.g., store, category,\ndepartment) to capture localized patterns; and (2) Architectural Ensemble (AE),\nwhich integrates predictions from diverse model backbones to mitigate bias and\nimprove stability. We conduct extensive experiments on the M5 benchmark and\nthree external sales datasets, covering both in-domain and zero-shot\nforecasting. Results show that our approach consistently outperforms strong\nbaselines, improves accuracy across hierarchical levels, and provides a simple\nyet effective mechanism for boosting generalization in complex forecasting\nenvironments."}

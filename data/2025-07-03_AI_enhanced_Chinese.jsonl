This paper,\nfor the first time, investigates the multi-generation issue in learned point\ncloud attribute compression. We identify two primary factors contributing to\nquality degradation in multi-generation compression: quantization-induced\nnon-idempotency and transformation irreversibility. To address the former, we\npropose a Mapping Idempotency Constraint, that enables the network to learn the\ncomplete compression-decompression mapping, enhancing its robustness to\nrepeated processes. To address the latter, we introduce a Transformation\nReversibility Constraint, which preserves reversible information flow via a\nquantization-free training path. Further, we propose a Latent Variable\nConsistency Constraint which enhances the multi-generation compression\nrobustness by incorporating a decompression-compression cross-generation path\nand a latent variable consistency loss term.

Answer-centric supervision is a\ncommonly used training method for 3D VQA models. Many models that utilize this\nstrategy have achieved promising results in 3D VQA tasks. However, the\nanswer-centric approach only supervises the final output of models and allows\nmodels to develop reasoning pathways freely. The absence of supervision on the\nreasoning pathway enables the potential for developing superficial shortcuts\nthrough common patterns in question-answer pairs. Moreover, although\nslow-thinking methods advance large language models, they suffer from\nunderthinking. To address these issues, we propose \\textbf{HCNQA}, a 3D VQA\nmodel leveraging a hierarchical concentration narrowing supervision method.

The averaged $J_2$ orbital\nparameters that describe the drift and periodic orbital motion were derived\nalong with their target values to achieve a distributed space structure in a\ndecentralized manner.

Continuous\nformation control was assumed to be achieved through fuel-free actuation, such\nas satellite magnetic field interaction and differential aerodynamic forces,\nthereby maintaining long-term formation stability without thruster usage. A\nmajor challenge for such actuation systems is the potential loss of control\ncapability due to increasing inter-satellite distances resulting from unstable\norbital dynamics, particularly for autonomous satellite swarms. To mitigate\nthis risk, our decentralized deployment controller minimized drift distance\nduring unexpected communication outages.

While recent\nadvances in deep neural networks have improved SOD, existing top-leading models\nare computationally expensive. We propose an efficient network design that\ncombines traditional wisdom on SOD and the representation power of modern CNNs.\nLike biologically-inspired classical SOD methods relying on computing contrast\ncues to determine saliency of image regions, our model leverages Pixel\nDifference Convolutions (PDCs) to encode the feature contrasts. Differently,\nPDCs are incorporated in a CNN architecture so that the valuable contrast cues\nare extracted from rich feature maps. For efficiency, we introduce a difference\nconvolution reparameterization (DCR) strategy that embeds PDCs into standard\nconvolutions, eliminating computation and parameters at inference.\nAdditionally, we introduce SpatioTemporal Difference Convolution (STDC) for\nvideo SOD, enhancing the standard 3D convolution with spatiotemporal contrast\ncapture. Our models, SDNet for image SOD and STDNet for video SOD, achieve\nsignificant improvements in efficiency-accuracy trade-offs. On a Jetson Orin\ndevice, our models with $<$ 1M parameters operate at 46 FPS and 150 FPS on\nstreamed images and videos, surpassing the second-best lightweight models in\nour experiments by more than $2\\times$ and $3\\times$ in speed with superior\naccuracy.

However, the high cost of multi-omics profiling imposes a\nsignificant economic burden, with over reliance on full omics data potentially\nleading to unnecessary resource consumption. To address these issues, we\npropose an uncertainty-aware, multi-view dynamic decision framework for omics\ndata classification that aims to achieve high diagnostic accuracy while\nminimizing testing costs. Methodology: At the single-omics level, we refine the\nactivation functions of neural networks to generate Dirichlet distribution\nparameters, utilizing subjective logic to quantify both the belief masses and\nuncertainty mass of classification results. Belief mass reflects the support of\na specific omics modality for a disease class, while the uncertainty parameter\ncaptures limitations in data quality and model discriminability, providing a\nmore trustworthy basis for decision-making. At the multi omics level, we employ\na fusion strategy based on Dempster-Shafer theory to integrate heterogeneous\nmodalities, leveraging their complementarity to boost diagnostic accuracy and\nrobustness. A dynamic decision mechanism is then applied that omics data are\nincrementally introduced for each patient until either all data sources are\nutilized or the model confidence exceeds a predefined threshold, potentially\nbefore all data sources are utilized. Results and Conclusion: We evaluate our\napproach on four benchmark multi-omics datasets, ROSMAP, LGG, BRCA, and KIPAN.\nIn three datasets, over 50% of cases achieved accurate classification using a\nsingle omics modality, effectively reducing redundant testing.

However, directly training policies to\nsimultaneously handle dual extreme challenges, i.e., extreme underactuation and\nextreme terrains, as in monopedal hopping tasks, remains highly challenging due\nto unstable early-stage interactions and unreliable reward feedback. To address\nthis, we propose JumpER (jump-start reinforcement learning via self-evolving\npriors), an RL training framework that structures policy learning into multiple\nstages of increasing complexity. By dynamically generating self-evolving priors\nthrough iterative bootstrapping of previously learned policies, JumpER\nprogressively refines and enhances guidance, thereby stabilizing exploration\nand policy optimization without relying on external expert priors or\nhandcrafted reward shaping. Specifically, when integrated with a structured\nthree-stage curriculum that incrementally evolves action modality, observation\nspace, and task objective, JumpER enables quadruped robots to achieve robust\nmonopedal hopping on unpredictable terrains for the first time. Remarkably, the\nresulting policy effectively handles challenging scenarios that traditional\nmethods struggle to conquer, including wide gaps up to 60 cm, irregularly\nspaced stairs, and stepping stones with distances varying from 15 cm to 35 cm.\nJumpER thus provides a principled and scalable approach for addressing\nlocomotion tasks under the dual challenges of extreme underactuation and\nextreme terrains.", "AI": {"tldr": "JumpER\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u6f14\u5316\u5148\u9a8c\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u56db\u8db3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u5730\u5f62\u4e0a\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u5355\u8db3\u8df3\u8dc3\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u6b20\u9a71\u52a8\u548c\u6781\u7aef\u5730\u5f62\u4e0b\u76f4\u63a5\u8bad\u7ec3\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u53cd\u9988\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faJumpER\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210\u81ea\u6f14\u5316\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u8bfe\u7a0b\u9010\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u56db\u8db3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u572860\u5398\u7c73\u5bbd\u95f4\u9699\u3001\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u697c\u68af\u548c15-35\u5398\u7c73\u95f4\u8ddd\u8e0f\u77f3\u4e0a\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u8df3\u8dc3\u3002", "conclusion": "JumpER\u4e3a\u6781\u7aef\u6b20\u9a71\u52a8\u548c\u6781\u7aef\u5730\u5f62\u4e0b\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To manage this process, we propose a Markov Decision Process\n(MDP) model that captures key uncertainties, including the stochastic arrival\nof orders and crowd-shippers, and the probabilistic acceptance of delivery\noffers. Our solution approach integrates Neural Approximate Dynamic Programming\n(NeurADP) for adaptive order-to-shopper assignment with a Deep Double Q-Network\n(DDQN) for dynamic pricing. This joint optimization strategy enables multi-drop\nrouting and accounts for offer acceptance uncertainty, aligning more closely\nwith real-world operations.

This article is a significantly extended version of a paper\n  presented by the authors at IJCAI-2022", "summary": "Non-monotonic logic programming is the basis for a declarative problem\nsolving paradigm known as answer set programming (ASP). Departing from the\nseminal definition by Gelfond and Lifschitz in 1988 for simple normal logic\nprograms, various answer set semantics have been proposed for extensions. We\nconsider two important questions: (1) Should the minimal model property,\nconstraint monotonicity and foundedness as defined in the literature be\nmandatory conditions for an answer set semantics in general? (2) If not, what\nother properties could be considered as general principles for answer set\nsemantics? We address the two questions. First, it seems that the three\naforementioned conditions may sometimes be too strong, and we illustrate with\nexamples that enforcing them may exclude expected answer sets. Second, we\nevolve the Gelfond answer set (GAS) principles for answer set construction by\nrefining the Gelfond's rationality principle to well-supportedness, minimality\nw.r.t. negation by default and minimality w.r.t. epistemic negation. The\nprinciple of well-supportedness guarantees that every answer set is\nconstructible from if-then rules obeying a level mapping and is thus free of\ncircular justification, while the two minimality principles ensure that the\nformalism minimizes knowledge both at the level of answer sets and of world\nviews. Third, to embody the refined GAS principles, we extend the notion of\nwell-supportedness substantially to answer sets and world views, respectively.\nFourth, we define new answer set semantics in terms of the refined GAS\nprinciples. Fifth, we use the refined GAS principles as an alternative baseline\nto intuitively assess the existing answer set semantics.

This approach leverages a pre-trained diffusion model,\nStable Diffusion XL, to overcome the generalization failures of existing\nmethods that rely on limited HDR panorama datasets. While conceptually simple,\nthe task remains challenging because diffusion models often insert incorrect or\ninconsistent content and cannot readily generate chrome balls in HDR format.\nOur analysis reveals that the inpainting process is highly sensitive to the\ninitial noise in the diffusion process, occasionally resulting in unrealistic\noutputs. To address this, we first introduce DiffusionLight, which uses\niterative inpainting to compute a median chrome ball from multiple outputs to\nserve as a stable, low-frequency lighting prior that guides the generation of a\nhigh-quality final result. To generate high-dynamic-range (HDR) light probes,\nan Exposure LoRA is fine-tuned to create LDR images at multiple exposure\nvalues, which are then merged. While effective, DiffusionLight is\ntime-intensive, requiring approximately 30 minutes per estimation. To reduce\nthis overhead, we introduce DiffusionLight-Turbo, which reduces the runtime to\nabout 30 seconds with minimal quality loss. This 60x speedup is achieved by\ntraining a Turbo LoRA to directly predict the averaged chrome balls from the\niterative process. Inference is further streamlined into a single denoising\npass using a LoRA swapping technique.

In this work, we propose an enhanced motion forecasting\nmodel informed by multiple vector map elements, including lane boundaries and\nroad edges, that facilitates a richer and more complete representation of\ndriving environments. An effective feature fusion strategy is developed to\nmerge information in different vector map components, where the model learns\nholistic information on road structures and their interactions with agents.\nSince encoding more information about the road environment increases memory\nusage and is computationally expensive, we developed an effective pruning\nmechanism that filters the most relevant map connections to the target agent,\nensuring computational efficiency while maintaining essential spatial and\nsemantic relationships for accurate trajectory prediction.

On the other hand, the\nexisting end-to-end neural vocoders suffer from a black-box nature that blinds\nthe speech production mechanism and the intrinsic structure of speech,\nresulting in the ambiguity of separately modeling source excitation and\nresonance characteristics and the loss of flexibly synthesizing or modifying\nspeech with high quality. Moreover, their sequence-wise waveform generation\nusually requires complicated networks, leading to substantial time consumption.\nIn this work, inspired by the quasi-harmonic model (QHM) that represents speech\nas sparse components, we combine the neural network and QHM synthesis process\nto propose a novel framework for the neural vocoder. Accordingly, speech\nsignals can be encoded into autoregressive moving average (ARMA) functions to\nmodel the resonance characteristics, yielding accurate estimates of the\namplitudes and phases of quasi-harmonics at any frequency. Subsequently, the\nspeech can be resynthesized and arbitrarily modified in terms of pitch shifting\nand time stretching with high quality, whereas the time consumption and network\nsize decrease.

Even approaches that incorporate advanced\ntraining techniques have not yielded meaningful performance improvements. We\nhypothesize that this brittleness stems primarily from limitations in\npreference datasets, which are often narrowly scoped, synthetically labeled, or\nlack rigorous quality control. To address these challenges, we present a\nlarge-scale preference dataset comprising 40 million preference pairs, named\nSynPref-40M. To enable data curation at scale, we design a human-AI synergistic\ntwo-stage pipeline that leverages the complementary strengths of human\nannotation quality and AI scalability. In this pipeline, humans provide\nverified annotations, while large language models perform automatic curation\nbased on human guidance.

Many\nendeavors to improve SD are to eliminate the need for a draft model and\ngenerate draft tokens in a retrieval-based manner in order to further alleviate\nthe drafting overhead and significantly reduce the difficulty in deployment and\napplications. However, retrieval-based SD relies on a matching paradigm to\nretrieval the most relevant reference as the draft tokens, where these methods\noften fail to find matched and accurate draft tokens. To address this\nchallenge, we propose LogitSpec to effectively expand the retrieval range and\nfind the most relevant reference as drafts. Our LogitSpec is motivated by the\nobservation that the logit of the last token can not only predict the next\ntoken, but also speculate the next next token. Specifically, LogitSpec\ngenerates draft tokens in two steps: (1) utilizing the last logit to speculate\nthe next next token; (2) retrieving relevant reference for both the next token\nand the next next token. LogitSpec is training-free and plug-and-play, which\ncan be easily integrated into existing LLM inference frameworks.

Camouflage-based physical attack is a more promising\napproach compared to the patch-based attack, offering stronger adversarial\neffectiveness in complex physical environments. However, most prior work relies\non mesh priors of the target object and virtual environments constructed by\nsimulators, which are time-consuming to obtain and inevitably differ from the\nreal world. Moreover, due to the limitations of the backgrounds in training\nimages, previous methods often fail to produce multi-view robust adversarial\ncamouflage and tend to fall into sub-optimal solutions. Due to these reasons,\nprior work lacks adversarial effectiveness and robustness across diverse\nviewpoints and physical environments. We propose a physical attack framework\nbased on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), named PGA, which provides rapid and\nprecise reconstruction with few images, along with photo-realistic rendering\ncapabilities.

Conventional deep learning approaches for analyzing\nthese signals typically rely on homogeneous datasets and static bespoke models,\nlimiting their robustness and generalizability across diverse clinical settings\nand acquisition protocols. In this study, we present a cardiac sensing\nfoundation model (CSFM) that leverages advanced transformer architectures and a\ngenerative, masked pretraining strategy to learn unified representations from\nvast, heterogeneous health records. Our model is pretrained on an innovative\nmulti-modal integration of data from multiple large-scale datasets (including\nMIMIC-III-WDB, MIMIC-IV-ECG, and CODE), comprising cardiac signals and the\ncorresponding clinical or machine-generated text reports from approximately 1.7\nmillion individuals. We demonstrate that the embeddings derived from our CSFM\nnot only serve as effective feature extractors across diverse cardiac sensing\nscenarios, but also enable seamless transfer learning across varying input\nconfigurations and sensor modalities. Extensive evaluations across diagnostic\ntasks, demographic information recognition, vital sign measurement, clinical\noutcome prediction, and ECG question answering reveal that CSFM consistently\noutperforms traditional one-modal-one-task approaches. Notably, CSFM exhibits\nrobust performance across multiple ECG lead configurations from standard\n12-lead systems to single-lead setups, and in scenarios where only ECG, only\nPPG, or a combination thereof is available.

Toward\nthis end, we propose PreferenceHack, a novel few-shot setting benchmark, the\nfirst to test reward models on reward hacking in a paired preference format.\nFinally, we show that Activation RM achieves state-of-the-art performance on\nthis benchmark, surpassing even GPT-4o.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5956\u52b1\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u2014\u2014\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff08Activation RMs\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5bfc\u5411\u6784\u5efa\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u5956\u52b1\u9ed1\u5ba2\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u5bf9\u9f50\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\uff08LMMs\uff09\u5230\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u5956\u52b1\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u504f\u597d\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff08Activation RMs\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5bfc\u5411\u6784\u5efa\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u5c11\u91cf\u76d1\u7763\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "Activation RMs\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982LLM-as-a-judge\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u65b0\u63d0\u51fa\u7684PreferenceHack\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8d8aGPT-4o\u3002", "conclusion": "Activation RMs\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Here, we aim to solve these gaps by proposing a variational\ndigital twin (VDT) framework that augments standard neural architectures with a\nsingle Bayesian output layer. This lightweight addition, along with a novel VDT\nupdating algorithm, lets a twin update in seconds on commodity GPUs while\nproducing calibrated uncertainty bounds that can inform experiment design,\ncontrol algorithms, and model reliability. The VDT is evaluated on four\nenergy-sector problems. For critical-heat-flux prediction, uncertainty-driven\nactive learning reaches R2 = 0.98 using 47 % fewer experiments and one-third\nthe training time of random sampling. A three-year renewable-generation twin\nmaintains R2 > 0.95 for solar output and curbs error growth for volatile wind\nforecasts via monthly updates that process only one month of data at a time. A\nnuclear reactor transient cooldown twin reconstructs thermocouple signals with\nR2 > 0.99 and preserves accuracy after 50 % sensor loss, demonstrating\nrobustness to degraded instrumentation. Finally, a physics-informed Li-ion\nbattery twin, retrained after every ten discharges, lowers voltage mean-squared\nerror by an order of magnitude relative to the best static model while adapting\nits credible intervals as the cell approaches end-of-life.

Prior work suggests that the use of\nexternal information, e.g., excerpts from Wikipedia, improves stance detection\nperformance. However, whether or not such information can benefit large\nlanguage models (LLMs) remains an unanswered question, despite their wide\nadoption in many reasoning tasks. In this study, we conduct a systematic\nevaluation on how Wikipedia and web search external information can affect\nstance detection across eight LLMs and in three datasets with 12 targets.\nSurprisingly, we find that such information degrades performance in most cases,\nwith macro F1 scores dropping by up to 27.9\\%. We explain this through\nexperiments showing LLMs' tendency to align their predictions with the stance\nand sentiment of the provided information rather than the ground truth stance\nof the given text. We also find that performance degradation persists with\nchain-of-thought prompting, while fine-tuning mitigates but does not fully\neliminate it.

However, existing\nmethods often suffer from identity leakage (IL) and rendering artifacts (RA),\nparticularly in extreme cases. Through an in-depth analysis of previous\napproaches, we identify two key insights: (1) IL arises from identity\ninformation embedded within motion features, and (2) this identity information\ncan be leveraged to address RA. Building on these findings, this paper\nintroduces FixTalk, a novel framework designed to simultaneously resolve both\nissues for high-quality talking head generation. Firstly, we propose an\nEnhanced Motion Indicator (EMI) to effectively decouple identity information\nfrom motion features, mitigating the impact of IL on generated talking heads.\nTo address RA, we introduce an Enhanced Detail Indicator (EDI), which utilizes\nthe leaked identity information to supplement missing details, thus fixing the\nartifacts.

Our results reveal clear\nperformance disparities across these groups: multilingual models perform best\non seen languages, moderately on partially seen ones, and poorly on unseen\nlanguages.

However, despite the dramatic improvement in generative\nvision-language models, fine-grained control over the properties of generated\ncaptions is not easy due to two reasons: (i) existing models are not given the\nproperties as a condition during training and (ii) existing models cannot\nsmoothly transition its language pattern from one state to the other. Given\nthis challenge, we propose a new approach, CaptionSmiths, to acquire a single\ncaptioning model that can handle diverse language patterns. First, our approach\nquantifies three properties of each caption, length, descriptiveness, and\nuniqueness of a word, as continuous scalar values, without human annotation.\nGiven the values, we represent the conditioning via interpolation between two\nendpoint vectors corresponding to the extreme states, e.g., one for a very\nshort caption and one for a very long caption. Empirical results demonstrate\nthat the resulting model can smoothly change the properties of the output\ncaptions and show higher lexical alignment than baselines.

While robust watermarking can aid in authenticity\nverification and source tracking, existing methods often lack the sufficient\nrobustness against Deepfake manipulations. Diffusion models have demonstrated\nremarkable performance in image generation, enabling the seamless fusion of\nwatermark with image during generation. In this study, we propose a novel\nrobust watermarking framework based on diffusion model, called DiffMark. By\nmodifying the training and sampling scheme, we take the facial image and\nwatermark as conditions to guide the diffusion model to progressively denoise\nand generate corresponding watermarked image. In the construction of facial\ncondition, we weight the facial image by a timestep-dependent factor that\ngradually reduces the guidance intensity with the decrease of noise, thus\nbetter adapting to the sampling process of diffusion model. To achieve the\nfusion of watermark condition, we introduce a cross information fusion (CIF)\nmodule that leverages a learnable embedding table to adaptively extract\nwatermark features and integrates them with image features via cross-attention.\nTo enhance the robustness of the watermark against Deepfake manipulations, we\nintegrate a frozen autoencoder during training phase to simulate Deepfake\nmanipulations. Additionally, we introduce Deepfake-resistant guidance that\nemploys specific Deepfake model to adversarially guide the diffusion sampling\nprocess to generate more robust watermarked images. Experimental results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DiffMark on typical Deepfakes.\nOur code will be available at https://github.com/vpsg-research/DiffMark.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6c34\u5370\u6846\u67b6DiffMark\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9762\u90e8\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u6c34\u5370\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u6297Deepfake\u7be1\u6539\u7684\u6c34\u5370\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9Deepfake\u7be1\u6539\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u5f02\u8868\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002", "method": "\u4fee\u6539\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u9762\u90e8\u6761\u4ef6\u6743\u91cd\u548c\u8de8\u4fe1\u606f\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\uff08CIF\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u96c6\u6210\u51bb\u7ed3\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6a21\u62dfDeepfake\u7be1\u6539\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660eDiffMark\u5728\u5178\u578bDeepfake\u7be1\u6539\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "DiffMark\u4e3a\u6297Deepfake\u7be1\u6539\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6c34\u5370\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Existing methods using maximal clique search in\ncompatibility graphs achieve high recall but suffer from exponential time\ncomplexity, limiting their use in time-sensitive applications. To address this\nchallenge, we propose a fast and robust estimator, TurboReg, built upon a novel\nlightweight clique, TurboClique, and a highly parallelizable Pivot-Guided\nSearch (PGS) algorithm. First, we define the TurboClique as a 3-clique within a\nhighly-constrained compatibility graph. The lightweight nature of the 3-clique\nallows for efficient parallel searching, and the highly-constrained\ncompatibility graph ensures robust spatial consistency for stable\ntransformation estimation. Next, PGS selects matching pairs with high SC$^2$\nscores as pivots, effectively guiding the search toward TurboCliques with\nhigher inlier ratios. Moreover, the PGS algorithm has linear time complexity\nand is significantly more efficient than the maximal clique search with\nexponential time complexity. Extensive experiments show that TurboReg achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance across multiple real-world datasets, with\nsubstantial speed improvements. For example, on the 3DMatch+FCGF dataset,\nTurboReg (1K) operates $208.22\\times$ faster than 3DMAC while also achieving\nhigher recall.

Existing pixel-wise methods typically assign anomaly\nscores individually and employ a global thresholding strategy to segment\nanomalies. Despite their effectiveness, these approaches encounter significant\nchallenges in real-world applications: (1) neglecting spatial correlations\namong pixels within the same object, resulting in fragmented segmentation; (2)\nvariabil ity in anomaly score distributions across image regions, causing\nglobal thresholds to either generate false positives in background areas or\nmiss segments of anomalous objects. In this work, we introduce OoDDINO, a novel\nmulti-level anomaly segmentation framework designed to address these\nlimitations through a coarse-to-fine anomaly detection strategy. OoDDINO\ncombines an uncertainty-guided anomaly detection model with a pixel-level\nsegmentation model within a two-stage cascade architecture. Initially, we\npropose an Orthogonal Uncertainty-Aware Fusion Strategy (OUAFS) that\nsequentially integrates multiple uncertainty metrics with visual\nrepresentations, employing orthogonal constraints to strengthen the detection\nmodel's capacity for localizing anomalous regions accurately. Subsequently, we\ndevelop an Adaptive Dual-Threshold Network (ADT-Net), which dynamically\ngenerates region-specific thresholds based on object-level detection outputs\nand pixel-wise anomaly scores. This approach allows for distinct thresholding\nstrategies within foreground and background areas, achieving fine-grained\nanomaly segmentation.

However, existing\nmethods still face challenges in coordinating mobile base and manipulator,\nprimarily due to two limitations. On the one hand, they fail to explicitly\nmodel the influence of the mobile base on manipulator control, which easily\nleads to error accumulation under high degrees of freedom. On the other hand,\nthey treat the entire mobile manipulation process with the same visual\nobservation modality (e.g., either all 2D or all 3D), overlooking the distinct\nmultimodal perception requirements at different stages during mobile\nmanipulation. To address this, we propose the Adaptive Coordination Diffusion\nTransformer (AC-DiT), which enhances mobile base and manipulator coordination\nfor end-to-end mobile manipulation. First, since the motion of the mobile base\ndirectly influences the manipulator's actions, we introduce a mobility-to-body\nconditioning mechanism that guides the model to first extract base motion\nrepresentations, which are then used as context prior for predicting whole-body\nactions. This enables whole-body control that accounts for the potential impact\nof the mobile base's motion. Second, to meet the perception requirements at\ndifferent stages of mobile manipulation, we design a perception-aware\nmultimodal conditioning strategy that dynamically adjusts the fusion weights\nbetween various 2D visual images and 3D point clouds, yielding visual features\ntailored to the current perceptual needs. This allows the model to, for\nexample, adaptively rely more on 2D inputs when semantic information is crucial\nfor action prediction, while placing greater emphasis on 3D geometric\ninformation when precise spatial understanding is required.

To handle\nthis, we propose a simple, yet powerful, framework, called: Novel Object Cyclic\nThreshold based Instance Segmentation (NOCTIS). This work stems from and\nimproves upon previous ones like CNOS, SAM-6D and NIDS-Net; thus, it also\nleverages on recent vision foundation models, namely: Grounded-SAM 2 and\nDINOv2. It utilises Grounded-SAM 2 to obtain object proposals with precise\nbounding boxes and their corresponding segmentation masks; while DINOv2's\nzero-shot capabilities are employed to generate the image embeddings. The\nquality of those masks, together with their embeddings, is of vital importance\nto our approach; as the proposal-object matching is realized by determining an\nobject matching score based on the similarity of the class embeddings and the\naverage maximum similarity of the patch embeddings. Differently to SAM-6D,\ncalculating the latter involves a prior patch filtering based on the distance\nbetween each patch and its corresponding cyclic/roundtrip patch in the image\ngrid. Furthermore, the average confidence of the proposals' bounding box and\nmask is used as an additional weighting factor for the object matching score.\nWe empirically show that NOCTIS, without further training/fine tuning,\noutperforms the best RGB and RGB-D methods on the seven core datasets of the\nBOP 2023 challenge for the \"Model-based 2D segmentation of unseen objects\"\ntask.", "AI": {"tldr": "NOCTIS\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5206\u5272\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528Grounded-SAM 2\u548cDINOv2\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728BOP 2023\u6311\u6218\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u5206\u5272\u5404\u79cd\u65b0\u7269\u4f53\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7684\u96be\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408Grounded-SAM 2\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u8c61\u63d0\u8bae\u548c\u5206\u5272\u63a9\u7801\uff0c\u5229\u7528DINOv2\u751f\u6210\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bf9\u8c61\u5339\u914d\u5206\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728BOP 2023\u6311\u6218\u7684\u4e03\u5927\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709RGB\u548cRGB-D\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "NOCTIS\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b80\u5355\u4f46\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u65b0\u7269\u4f53\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

The inference process concurrently reconstructs\nboth image latents and their corresponding global semantics, where the acquired\nsemantic knowledge actively guides and enhances the image generation process.\nOn ImageNet 256$\\times$256, SiT-XL/2 + REG demonstrates remarkable convergence\nacceleration, achieving $\\textbf{63}\\times$ and $\\textbf{23}\\times$ faster\ntraining than SiT-XL/2 and SiT-XL/2 + REPA, respectively.

(2025) of the \"perfect\" Platonic Representation Hypothesis (PRH) for the\nembedded deep linear network model (EDLN). We show that if trained with SGD,\ntwo EDLNs with different widths and depths and trained on different data will\nbecome Perfectly Platonic, meaning that every possible pair of layers will\nlearn the same representation up to a rotation. Because most of the global\nminima of the loss function are not Platonic, that SGD only finds the perfectly\nPlatonic solution is rather extraordinary. The proof also suggests at least six\nways the PRH can be broken. We also show that in the EDLN model, the emergence\nof the Platonic representations is due to the same reason as the emergence of\nprogressive sharpening.

The dataset\nconsists of SCR measurements along with features such as the response amplitude\nand elapsed time, which have been categorized into amplitude-based classes. The\nQSVM achieved good training accuracy, but had an overfitting problem, showing a\nlow test accuracy of 45% and therefore impacting the reliability of the\nclassification model. The QNN model reached a higher test accuracy of 55%,\nmaking it a better classification model than the QSVM and the classic versions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5efa\u6a21\u76ae\u80a4\u7535\u5bfc\u53cd\u5e94\uff08SCR\uff09\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u673a\uff08QSVM\uff09\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08QNN\uff09\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5229\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u667a\u80fd\u4ea4\u901a\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u8868\u793a\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8ePennylane\u7684QSVM\uff08\u4f7f\u7528\u516b\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4dZZ\u7279\u5f81\u56fe\uff09\u548cQNN\uff08\u4f7f\u7528\u6811\u5f20\u91cf\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u516b\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4dZZ\u7279\u5f81\u56fe\uff09\u3002", "result": "QSVM\u8bad\u7ec3\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u9ad8\u4f46\u6d4b\u8bd5\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4f4e\uff0845%\uff09\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u95ee\u9898\uff1bQNN\u6d4b\u8bd5\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0855%\uff09\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8eQSVM\u548c\u7ecf\u5178\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "QNN\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6570\u636e\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Consequently,\nsegmentation models must ensure not only the semantic correctness of\nlarge-scale patches (low-frequency information) but also the precise\nlocalization of boundaries between patches (high-frequency information).\nHowever, most existing approaches rely heavily on discriminative learning,\nwhich excels at capturing low-frequency features, while overlooking its\ninherent limitations in learning high-frequency features for semantic\nsegmentation. Recent studies have revealed that diffusion generative models\nexcel at generating high-frequency details. Our theoretical analysis confirms\nthat the diffusion denoising process significantly enhances the model's ability\nto learn high-frequency features; however, we also observe that these models\nexhibit insufficient semantic inference for low-frequency features when guided\nsolely by the original image. Therefore, we integrate the strengths of both\ndiscriminative and generative learning, proposing the Integration of\nDiscriminative and diffusion-based Generative learning for Boundary Refinement\n(IDGBR) framework. The framework first generates a coarse segmentation map\nusing a discriminative backbone model.

However,\nMSE-oriented optimization tends to yield latent spaces with limited semantic\nrichness, which hinders effective semantic inference in downstream tasks.\nMoreover, achieving high performance with these models often requires\nfine-tuning the entire vision model, which is computationally intensive,\nespecially for large models. To address these problems, we introduce\nPerception-Oriented Latent Coding (POLC), an approach that enriches the\nsemantic content of latent features for high-performance compressed domain\nsemantic inference.

We pretrain transformer models on sample traces from this\ntoy, specifically symbolically-labeled interleaved state observations from\nrandomly drawn linear deterministic dynamical systems. We study if the\ntransformer models can recall the state of a sequence previously seen in its\ncontext when prompted to do so with the corresponding in-context label. Taking\na closer look at this task, it becomes clear that the model must perform two\nfunctions: (1) identify which system's state should be recalled and apply that\nsystem to its last seen state, and (2) continuing to apply the correct system\nto predict the subsequent states. Training dynamics reveal that the first\ncapability emerges well into a model's training. Surprisingly, the second\ncapability, of continuing the prediction of a resumed sequence, develops much\nearlier.\n  Via out-of-distribution experiments, and a mechanistic analysis on model\nweights via edge pruning, we find that next-token prediction for this toy\nproblem involves at least two separate mechanisms. One mechanism uses the\ndiscrete symbolic labels to do the associative recall required to predict the\nstart of a resumption of a previously seen sequence. The second mechanism,\nwhich is largely agnostic to the discrete symbolic labels, performs a\n\"Bayesian-style\" prediction based on the previous token and the context. These\ntwo mechanisms have different learning dynamics.\n  To confirm that this multi-mechanism (manifesting as separate phase\ntransitions) phenomenon is not just an artifact of our toy setting, we used\nOLMo training checkpoints on an ICL translation task to see a similar\nphenomenon: a decisive gap in the emergence of first-task-token performance vs\nsecond-task-token performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u5f0f\u8fde\u7eed\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\uff08ICL\uff09\u548c\u79bb\u6563\u5173\u8054\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u73a9\u5177\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6b64\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u5b8c\u6210\u4e24\u79cd\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u4e24\u79cd\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u4e0d\u540c\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ed3\u5408\u8fde\u7eed\u548c\u79bb\u6563\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5176\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5982\u4f55\u5b9e\u73b0\u5173\u8054\u8bb0\u5fc6\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u4e8e\u7b26\u53f7\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u968f\u673a\u7ebf\u6027\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5728\u5173\u8054\u8bb0\u5fc6\u548c\u72b6\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u5b8c\u6210\u4e24\u79cd\u529f\u80fd\uff1a\u5173\u8054\u8bb0\u5fc6\u548c\u72b6\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e14\u4e24\u79cd\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u4e0d\u540c\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u591a\u673a\u5236\u73b0\u8c61\u5728ICL\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u666e\u904d\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u591a\u673a\u5236\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u73b0\u8c61\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e\u73a9\u5177\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e5f\u5b58\u5728\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u3002"}}

Furthermore, we propose the Spatial Distance Constraint to\nexplicitly enforce the model to learn patch-level relative relationships,\nresulting in clearer semantic boundaries and more accurate details.\nExperimental results demonstrate the zero-shot capabilities of DepthAnything-AC\nacross diverse benchmarks, including real-world adverse weather benchmarks,\nsynthetic corruption benchmarks, and general benchmarks.\n  Project Page: https://ghost233lism.github.io/depthanything-AC-page\n  Code: https://github.com/HVision-NKU/DepthAnythingAC", "AI": {"tldr": "DepthAnything-AC\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u7840\u5355\u76ee\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u591a\u6837\u73af\u5883\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u8ddd\u79bb\u7ea6\u675f\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7840MDE\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5982\u5149\u7167\u53d8\u5316\u3001\u6076\u52a3\u5929\u6c14\u548c\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5931\u771f\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5fae\u8c03\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u5c11\u91cf\u672a\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u8ddd\u79bb\u7ea6\u675f\u4ee5\u5b66\u4e60\u5757\u7ea7\u76f8\u5bf9\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u6076\u52a3\u5929\u6c14\u3001\u5408\u6210\u5931\u771f\u548c\u901a\u7528\u573a\u666f\uff09\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "DepthAnything-AC\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u8d28\u91cf\u4f4e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

A key\nadvantage is its seamless integration into existing open-source frameworks,\nrequiring only minimal modifications to the standard RFT pipeline. Our analysis\nhighlights the complementary nature of SFT and RFT, and validates that\nPrefix-RFT effectively harmonizes these two learning paradigms.

The ConvNet captures fine-grained local\nstructures, while the denoising transformer refines global representations,\neffectively mitigating the impact of noise, low visibility, and weather-induced\ndistortions.

However, its reliance on\nlarge volumes of labeled data raises privacy and security concerns such as\nsusceptibility to data poisoning attacks and the risk of overfitting. In\ncontrast, black box optimization methods, which treat the model as an opaque\nfunction, relying solely on function evaluations to guide optimization, offer a\npromising alternative in scenarios where data access is restricted, adversarial\nrisks are high, or overfitting is a concern.

These\nfindings provide new insights into the functional mechanisms of hippocampal\naging and demonstrate the power of explainable deep learning to uncover\nbiologically meaningful patterns in neuroimaging data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc73D CNN\u548cLayerCAM\u663e\u8457\u6027\u6620\u5c04\u9884\u6d4b\u5927\u8111\u5e74\u9f84\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6d77\u9a6c\u4f53\u4e0e\u7279\u5b9a\u76ae\u8d28\u533a\u57df\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u8fde\u63a5\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u6d77\u9a6c\u4f53\u7070\u8d28\u51cf\u5c11\u662f\u795e\u7ecf\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u8870\u8001\u7684\u6807\u5fd7\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u529f\u80fd\u8fde\u63a5\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63ed\u793a\u6d77\u9a6c\u4f53\u529f\u80fd\u91cd\u7ec4\u4e0e\u8870\u8001\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u79cd\u5b50\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u8fde\u63a5\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7ed3\u54083D CNN\u548cLayerCAM\u663e\u8457\u6027\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u5927\u8111\u5e74\u9f84\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u6d77\u9a6c\u4f53-\u76ae\u8d28\u8fde\u63a5\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6d77\u9a6c\u4f53\u4e0e\u6954\u524d\u53f6\u3001\u6954\u53f6\u3001\u540e\u6263\u5e26\u56de\u76ae\u8d28\u7b49\u533a\u57df\u7684\u8fde\u63a5\u5bf9\u5e74\u9f84\u9ad8\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u524d\u3001\u540e\u6d77\u9a6c\u4f53\u529f\u80fd\u8fde\u63a5\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u6d77\u9a6c\u4f53\u8870\u8001\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u5f71\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

We first analyze different vision\nnetwork architectures to examine how varying sparsity levels affect feature\nattribution interpretability methods. Additionally, we explore whether pruning\npromotes more succinct and structured representations, potentially improving\nunsupervised object discovery by discarding redundant information while\npreserving essential features.

Specifically, we introduce a distributed data storage and\ntransfer module that provides a unified data management and fine-grained\nscheduling capability in a fully streamed manner. This architecture inherently\nfacilitates automated pipeline overlapping among RL tasks and dynamic load\nbalancing. Moreover, we propose a producer-consumer-based asynchronous workflow\nengineered to minimize computational idleness by strategically deferring\nparameter update process within staleness thresholds. Finally, the core\ncapability of AsynFlow is architecturally decoupled from underlying training\nand inference engines and encapsulated by service-oriented user interfaces,\noffering a modular and customizable user experience. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate an average of 1.59 throughput improvement compared with\nstate-of-the-art baseline.

However, in real-world scenarios where\nannotation resources are limited, a vast amount of unlabeled data coexists with\nscarce labeled samples, leading to the Semi-Supervised LReID (Semi-LReID)\nproblem where LReID methods suffer severe performance degradation.

In this paper, we\npioneer the investigation of Semi-LReID, introducing a novel Self-Reinforcing\nPrototype Evolution with Dual-Knowledge Cooperation framework (SPRED). Our key\ninnovation lies in establishing a self-reinforcing cycle between dynamic\nprototype-guided pseudo-label generation and new-old knowledge collaborative\npurification to enhance the utilization of unlabeled data.

To address this, patient-specific digital twins\n(DT) modeling temporally varying motion were created to assess the accuracy of\nDIR methods. Approach: 21 motion phases simulating digestive GI motion as 4D\nsequences were generated from static 3D patient scans using published\nanalytical GI motion models through a semi-automated pipeline. Eleven datasets,\nincluding six T2w FSE MRI (T2w MRI), two T1w 4D golden-angle stack-of-stars,\nand three contrast-enhanced CT scans. The motion amplitudes of the DTs were\nassessed against real patient stomach motion amplitudes extracted from\nindependent 4D MRI datasets. The generated DTs were then used to assess six\ndifferent DIR methods using target registration error, Dice similarity\ncoefficient, and the 95th percentile Hausdorff distance using summary metrics\nand voxel-level granular visualizations. Finally, for a subset of T2w MRI scans\nfrom patients treated with MR-guided radiation therapy, dose distributions were\nwarped and accumulated to assess dose warping errors, including evaluations of\nDIR performance in both low- and high-dose regions for patient-specific error\nestimation. Main results: Our proposed pipeline synthesized DTs modeling\nrealistic GI motion, achieving mean and maximum motion amplitudes and a mean\nlog Jacobian determinant within 0.8 mm and 0.01, respectively, similar to\npublished real-patient gastric motion data.

However,\ncurrent approaches conventionally separate image customization into\nposition-aware and position-free customization paradigms and lack a universal\nframework for diverse customization, limiting their applications across various\nscenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose IC-Custom, a unified\nframework that seamlessly integrates position-aware and position-free image\ncustomization through in-context learning. IC-Custom concatenates reference\nimages with target images to a polyptych, leveraging DiT's multi-modal\nattention mechanism for fine-grained token-level interactions. We introduce the\nIn-context Multi-Modal Attention (ICMA) mechanism with learnable task-oriented\nregister tokens and boundary-aware positional embeddings to enable the model to\ncorrectly handle different task types and distinguish various inputs in\npolyptych configurations. To bridge the data gap, we carefully curated a\nhigh-quality dataset of 12k identity-consistent samples with 8k from real-world\nsources and 4k from high-quality synthetic data, avoiding the overly glossy and\nover-saturated synthetic appearance. IC-Custom supports various industrial\napplications, including try-on, accessory placement, furniture arrangement, and\ncreative IP customization. Extensive evaluations on our proposed ProductBench\nand the publicly available DreamBench demonstrate that IC-Custom significantly\noutperforms community workflows, closed-source models, and state-of-the-art\nopen-source approaches. IC-Custom achieves approximately 73% higher human\npreference across identity consistency, harmonicity, and text alignment\nmetrics, while training only 0.4% of the original model parameters.

To address\nthis, we propose mGRADE (mininally Gated Recurrent Architecture with Delay\nEmbedding), a hybrid-memory system that integrates a temporal 1D-convolution\nwith learnable spacings followed by a minimal gated recurrent unit (minGRU).\nThis design allows the convolutional layer to realize a flexible delay\nembedding that captures rapid temporal variations, while the recurrent module\nefficiently maintains global context with minimal memory overhead. We validate\nour approach on two synthetic tasks, demonstrating that mGRADE effectively\nseparates and preserves multi-scale temporal features. Furthermore, on\nchallenging pixel-by-pixel image classification benchmarks, mGRADE consistently\noutperforms both pure convolutional and pure recurrent counterparts using\napproximately 20% less memory footprint, highlighting its suitability for\nmemory-constrained temporal processing at the edge. This highlights mGRADE's\npromise as an efficient solution for memory-constrained multi-scale temporal\nprocessing at the edge.", "AI": {"tldr": "mGRADE\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u5185\u5b58\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e861D\u5377\u79ef\u548c\u6700\u5c0f\u95e8\u63a7\u5faa\u73af\u5355\u5143\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5185\u5b58\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u65f6\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u5728\u5185\u5b58\u53d7\u9650\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5904\u7406\u77ed\u65f6\u548c\u957f\u65f6\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u907f\u514d\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982Transformers\u3001RNNs\u548cTCNs\uff09\u7684\u7f3a\u70b9\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51famGRADE\uff0c\u7ed3\u54081D\u5377\u79ef\u548cminGRU\uff0c\u5377\u79ef\u5c42\u6355\u6349\u5feb\u901f\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5faa\u73af\u6a21\u5757\u7ef4\u6301\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cmGRADE\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u7eaf\u5377\u79ef\u548c\u7eaf\u5faa\u73af\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u51cf\u5c1120%\u3002", "conclusion": "mGRADE\u662f\u5185\u5b58\u53d7\u9650\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e2d\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u65f6\u95f4\u5904\u7406\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Recently,\ninfluence-aware GR has emerged as a promising direction, as it considers the\nimpact of social influence on group decision-making. In earlier work, we\nproposed Influence-aware Group Recommendation (IGR) to solve this task.\nHowever, this task remains challenging due to three key factors: the large and\never-growing scale of social graphs, the inherently dynamic nature of influence\npropagation within user groups, and the high computational overhead of\nreal-time group-item matching.\n  To tackle these issues, we propose an Enhanced Influence-aware Group\nRecommendation (EIGR) framework.

To bridge this gap, we introduce \\textbf{Kwai Keye-VL}, an\n8-billion-parameter multimodal foundation model engineered for leading-edge\nperformance in short-video understanding while maintaining robust\ngeneral-purpose vision-language abilities. The development of Keye-VL rests on\ntwo core pillars: a massive, high-quality dataset exceeding 600 billion tokens\nwith a strong emphasis on video, and an innovative training recipe. This recipe\nfeatures a four-stage pre-training process for solid vision-language alignment,\nfollowed by a meticulous two-phase post-training process. The first\npost-training stage enhances foundational capabilities like instruction\nfollowing, while the second phase focuses on stimulating advanced reasoning. In\nthis second phase, a key innovation is our five-mode ``cold-start'' data\nmixture, which includes ``thinking'', ``non-thinking'', ``auto-think'', ``think\nwith image'', and high-quality video data. This mixture teaches the model to\ndecide when and how to reason.

Despite significant progress in this field, current\nmulti-organ segmentation models often suffer from inaccurate details,\ndependence on geometric prompts and loss of spatial information. Addressing\nthese challenges, we introduce a novel model named CRISP-SAM2 with CRoss-modal\nInteraction and Semantic Prompting based on SAM2. This model represents a\npromising approach to multi-organ medical segmentation guided by textual\ndescriptions of organs. Our method begins by converting visual and textual\ninputs into cross-modal contextualized semantics using a progressive\ncross-attention interaction mechanism. These semantics are then injected into\nthe image encoder to enhance the detailed understanding of visual information.\nTo eliminate reliance on geometric prompts, we use a semantic prompting\nstrategy, replacing the original prompt encoder to sharpen the perception of\nchallenging targets.

We evaluated the proposed model using five public\ndatasets, comprising lung cancer (LC2500 $n$=3183, IQ-OTH/NCCD $n$=1336, and\nLCC $n$=25000 images) and lung disease (ChestXray $n$=5856, and COVIDx-CT\n$n$=425024 images). To address class imbalance, we used data augmentation\ntechniques to artificially increase the representation of underrepresented\nclasses in the training dataset. The experimental results show that ResNet+\nmodel demonstrated remarkable accuracy/F1, reaching 98.14/98.14\\% on the\nLC25000 dataset and 99.25/99.13\\% on the IQ-OTH/NCCD dataset. Furthermore, the\nResNet+ model saved computational cost compared to the original ResNet series\nin predicting lung cancer images. The proposed model outperformed the baseline\nmodels on publicly available datasets, achieving better performance metrics.\nOur codes are publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/AIPMLab/Graduation-2024/tree/main/Peng.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aResNet+\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u6df1\u5ea6\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6539\u8fdb\u80ba\u764c\u548c\u80ba\u90e8\u75be\u75c5\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210ResNet-D\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u5377\u79ef\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u80ba\u764c\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edfCNN\u5728\u964d\u91c7\u6837\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eResNet\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165ResNet-D\u6a21\u5757\u6539\u8fdb\u964d\u91c7\u6837\u5c42\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u74f6\u9888\u5c42\u52a0\u5165\u5377\u79ef\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u6280\u672f\u89e3\u51b3\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "ResNet+\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5982LC2500\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523098.14%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387/F1\u503c\uff0cIQ-OTH/NCCD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523099.25%/99.13%\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\u4e8e\u539f\u59cbResNet\u7cfb\u5217\u3002", "conclusion": "ResNet+\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u80ba\u764c\u548c\u80ba\u90e8\u75be\u75c5\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4ee3\u7801\u5df2\u516c\u5f00\u3002"}}

However, this integration also\nintroduces new vulnerabilities, making MLLMs susceptible to multimodal\njailbreak attacks and hindering their safe deployment.Existing defense methods,\nincluding Image-to-Text Translation, Safe Prompting, and Multimodal Safety\nTuning, attempt to address this by aligning multimodal inputs with LLMs'\nbuilt-in safeguards.Yet, they fall short in uncovering root causes of\nmultimodal vulnerabilities, particularly how harmful multimodal tokens trigger\njailbreak in MLLMs? Consequently, they remain vulnerable to text-driven\nmultimodal jailbreaks, often exhibiting overdefensive behaviors and imposing\nheavy training overhead.To bridge this gap, we present an comprehensive\nanalysis of where, how and which harmful multimodal tokens bypass safeguards in\nMLLMs. Surprisingly, we find that less than 1% tokens in early-middle layers\nare responsible for inducing unsafe behaviors, highlighting the potential of\nprecisely removing a small subset of harmful tokens, without requiring safety\ntuning, can still effectively improve safety against jailbreaks. Motivated by\nthis, we propose Safe Prune-then-Restore (SafePTR), an training-free defense\nframework that selectively prunes harmful tokens at vulnerable layers while\nrestoring benign features at subsequent layers.Without incurring additional\ncomputational overhead, SafePTR significantly enhances the safety of MLLMs\nwhile preserving efficiency.

Previous to our research, food crystals\nin the images were manually counted, which required substantial and\ntime-consuming human efforts, but we have developed and deployed a crystal\nanalysis tool which makes this process both more rapid and accurate.

Second, it replaces traditional linear scaling with a tensor\nlinear regression technique, greatly enhancing the efficiency of numerical\ncoefficient optimization. We validate SITE using two benchmark scenarios, where\nit accurately recovers target equations from synthetic data, showing robustness\nto noise and small sample sizes.

While ordinal comparison data\nintuitively offer richer information than binary comparisons, this paper\nchallenges that conventional wisdom.

The model adopts a\ngeneralized additive structure, featuring a link function that quantifies the\npreference difference between two items and a pattern function that governs the\ndistribution over ordinal response levels. This framework encompasses classical\nbinary comparison models as special cases, by treating binary responses as\nbinarized versions of ordinal data. Within this framework, we show that\nbinarizing ordinal data can significantly improve the accuracy of ranking\nrecovery. Specifically, we prove that under the counting algorithm, the ranking\nerror associated with binary comparisons exhibits a faster exponential\nconvergence rate than that of ordinal data. Furthermore, we characterize a\nsubstantial performance gap between binary and ordinal data in terms of a\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) determined by the pattern function.

We identify key challenges\nand gaps we have observed since the early-access phase (2023) of Alps by the\nSwiss AI community and propose several technological enhancements. These\ninclude a user environment designed to facilitate the adoption of HPC for ML\nworkloads, balancing performance with flexibility; a utility for rapid\nperformance screening of ML applications during development; observability\ncapabilities and data products for inspecting ongoing large-scale ML workloads;\na utility to simplify the vetting of allocated nodes for compute readiness; a\nservice plane infrastructure to deploy various types of workloads, including\nsupport and inference services; and a storage infrastructure tailored to the\nspecific needs of ML workloads. These enhancements aim to facilitate the\nexecution of ML workloads on HPC systems, increase system usability and\nresilience, and better align with the needs of the ML community. We also\ndiscuss our current approach to security aspects. This paper concludes by\nplacing these proposals in the broader context of changes in the communities\nserved by HPC infrastructure like ours.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u6269\u5c55HPC\u670d\u52a1\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u652f\u6301ML\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u591a\u9879\u6280\u672f\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfHPC\u670d\u52a1\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3ML\u793e\u533a\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u6269\u5c55\u670d\u52a1\u80fd\u529b\u4ee5\u652f\u6301ML\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5305\u62ec\u7528\u6237\u73af\u5883\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u6027\u80fd\u7b5b\u67e5\u5de5\u5177\u3001\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u8282\u70b9\u5ba1\u67e5\u5de5\u5177\u3001\u670d\u52a1\u5e73\u9762\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u548c\u5b58\u50a8\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u5728\u5185\u7684\u591a\u9879\u6280\u672f\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "result": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6539\u8fdb\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u5347ML\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5728HPC\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u7684\u6267\u884c\u6548\u7387\u3001\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u548c\u97e7\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u63d0\u8bae\u7f6e\u4e8eHPC\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u670d\u52a1\u793e\u533a\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u6280\u672f\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

A common approach to understanding these systems is to\nmodel the dynamics of each subsystem and characterize communication between\nthem. An alternative approach is through the lens of control theory: how the\nsubsystems control one another. This approach involves inferring the\ndirectionality, strength, and contextual modulation of control between\nsubsystems. However, methods for understanding subsystem control are typically\nlinear and cannot adequately describe the rich contextual effects enabled by\nnonlinear complex systems. To bridge this gap, we devise a data-driven\nnonlinear control-theoretic framework to characterize subsystem interactions\nvia the Jacobian of the dynamics. We address the challenge of learning\nJacobians from time-series data by proposing the JacobianODE, a deep learning\nmethod that leverages properties of the Jacobian to directly estimate it for\narbitrary dynamical systems from data alone. We show that JacobianODEs\noutperform existing Jacobian estimation methods on challenging systems,\nincluding high-dimensional chaos. Applying our approach to a multi-area\nrecurrent neural network (RNN) trained on a working memory selection task, we\nshow that the \"sensory\" area gains greater control over the \"cognitive\" area\nover learning. Furthermore, we leverage the JacobianODE to directly control the\ntrained RNN, enabling precise manipulation of its behavior.

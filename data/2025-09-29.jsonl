Current reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning methods, while\nenhancing reasoning abilities, largely fail to address the underlying\nmisalignment between visual grounding and the subsequent reasoning process. To\naddress this challenge, we propose \\textbf{Caption-Regularized Policy\nOptimization (CapPO)}, a novel RL framework that explicitly enforces perceptual\nconsistency during policy optimization. CapPO integrates two key mechanisms:\n(1) a caption-based consistency regularization, which minimizes the divergence\nbetween responses conditioned on raw images and those conditioned on captions,\nthereby anchoring reasoning to semantically faithful visual content; and (2) a\nKL-weighted advantage estimation scheme, which adaptively scales reinforcement\nsignals to strengthen perceptually consistent trajectories while suppressing\nspurious correlations. Extensive experiments on five math-focused and five\ngeneral reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that CapPO achieves competitive\nperformance, yielding gains of +6.0% accuracy on math-related tasks and +2.4%\non general reasoning tasks over the base Qwen2.5-VL-7B model.

Specifically, we utilize ABC notation to bridge the text\nand music modalities, enabling the VLM to generate music using natural\nlanguage. We then apply multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and\nself-refinement techniques to allow the VLM to produce high-quality music\nwithout external training. Furthermore, we leverage the generated motivations\nin text and the attention maps from the VLM to provide explanations for the\ngenerated results in both text and image modalities. To validate our method, we\nconduct both human studies and machine evaluations, where our method\noutperforms others in terms of music quality and music-image consistency,\nindicating promising results.

This paper formulate two fundamental desiderata\nfor DFCMM: transparency, avoiding interference with earlier tasks, and\nfidelity, adapting faithfully to each new task. This poses a challenge that\nexisting approaches fail to address: how to bridge data-level desiderata with\nparameter-space optimization to ensure transparency and fidelity in the absence\nof task data. To this end, we propose NUFILT (NUll-space FILTering), a\ndata-free framework that directly links these desiderata to optimization. Our\nkey observation is that task vectors approximately align with representation\nsubspaces, providing structural surrogates for enforcing transparency and\nfidelity. Accordingly, we design a null-space projector that preserves prior\nresponses by filtering out overlapping components of new task vectors, thereby\nensuring transparency, and a lightweight LoRA adapter that injects\ncomplementary task-specific signals, enabling fidelity in adapting to new\ntasks. The adapter is trained with a projection-based surrogate loss to retain\nconsistency with previous knowledge while introducing novel directions. This\njoint filtering-adaptation process allows the backbone to absorb new knowledge\nwhile retaining existing behaviors, and the updates are finally fused back in a\nlayer-wise linear fashion without extra parameters or inference cost.\nTheoretically, we establish approximate subspace alignment guarantees that\njustify null-space filtering.

To overcome these limitations, we introduce DS-STAR,\na novel data science agent.

Existing task planning methods, including\ntraditional and LLM-based approaches, often exhibit limited generalization or\nsparse semantic reasoning.

While KV-cache compression via low-rank projection is a promising\ndirection, existing methods rely on a static, offline-learned subspace that\nperforms poorly under data distribution shifts. To overcome these limitations,\nwe introduce OjaKV, a novel framework that integrates a strategic hybrid\nstorage policy with online subspace adaptation. First, OjaKV recognizes that\nnot all tokens are equally important for compression; it preserves the crucial\nfirst and most recent tokens in full-rank, maintaining high-fidelity anchors\nfor attention. Second, for the vast majority of intermediate tokens, it applies\nlow-rank compression by incrementally adapting the projection basis using Oja's\nalgorithm for online principal component analysis. This adaptation involves a\ncomprehensive update during prompt prefilling and lightweight periodic updates\nduring decoding, ensuring the subspace remains aligned with the evolving\ncontext. Crucially, our framework is fully compatible with modern attention\nmodules like FlashAttention.

In (I), $G_F$ is random, and top layer overfits to random hidden\nrepresentation. In (II), the gradient of each node (column of $G_F$) only\ndepends on its own activation, and thus each hidden node learns their\nrepresentation independently from $G_F$, which now carries information about\ntarget labels, thanks to weight decay.

However, some existing\nICP-based methods do not consider the reliability of the initial pose, which\nmay cause the method to converge to a local optimum. Furthermore, the absence\nof an adaptive mechanism hinders the effective handling of complex dynamic\nenvironments, resulting in a significant degradation of registration accuracy.\nTo address these issues, this paper proposes an adaptive ICP-based LiDAR\nodometry method that relies on a reliable initial pose. First, distributed\ncoarse registration based on density filtering is employed to obtain the\ninitial pose estimation. The reliable initial pose is then selected by\ncomparing it with the motion prediction pose, reducing the initial error\nbetween the source and target point clouds. Subsequently, by combining the\ncurrent and historical errors, the adaptive threshold is dynamically adjusted\nto accommodate the real-time changes in the dynamic environment. Finally, based\non the reliable initial pose and the adaptive threshold, point-to-plane\nadaptive ICP registration is performed from the current frame to the local map,\nachieving high-precision alignment of the source and target point clouds.\nExtensive experiments on the public KITTI dataset demonstrate that the proposed\nmethod outperforms existing approaches and significantly enhances the accuracy\nof LiDAR odometry."}

To\ninform and enhance operations for these roving laboratories, it is imperative\nto understand the terramechanical properties of their environments, especially\nfor traversing on loose, deformable substrates. Recent research suggested that\nlegged robots with direct-drive and low-gear ratio actuators can sensitively\ndetect external forces, and therefore possess the potential to measure terrain\nproperties with their legs during locomotion, providing unprecedented sampling\nspeed and density while accessing terrains previously too risky to sample. This\npaper explores these ideas by investigating the impact of gait on\nproprioceptive terrain sensing accuracy, particularly comparing a\nsensing-oriented gait, Crawl N' Sense, with a locomotion-oriented gait,\nTrot-Walk. Each gait's ability to measure the strength and texture of\ndeformable substrate is quantified as the robot locomotes over a laboratory\ntransect consisting of a rigid surface, loose sand, and loose sand with\nsynthetic surface crusts.

Classical\npruning methods mitigate this shortcoming by systematically removing extraneous\nskeletal branches. This sequential simplification of skeletons resembles the\nprinciple of sparsification scale-spaces that embed images into a family of\nreconstructions from increasingly sparse pixel representations.\n  We combine both worlds by introducing skeletonisation scale-spaces: They\nleverage sparsification of the medial axis to achieve hierarchical\nsimplification of shapes.

By training LMs from scratch on a\nsynthetic dataset of relational knowledge graphs, we demonstrate that bilinear\nrelational structure emerges in their hidden representations.

Our study provides the first comprehensive analysis of this tunable\nspace, offering practical guidelines for creating LLMs with specific reasoning\nprofiles to meet diverse application demands."}

We argue that this\ncatastrophic forgetting is due to a distribution mismatch between the VLM's\ninternet-scale pretraining corpus and the robotics fine-tuning data. Inspired\nby this observation, we introduce VLM2VLA: a VLA training paradigm that first\nresolves this mismatch at the data level by representing low-level actions with\nnatural language. This alignment makes it possible to train VLAs solely with\nLow-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), thereby minimally modifying the VLM backbone and\naverting catastrophic forgetting. As a result, the VLM can be fine-tuned on\nrobot teleoperation data without fundamentally altering the underlying\narchitecture and without expensive co-training on internet-scale VLM datasets.\nThrough extensive Visual Question Answering (VQA) studies and over 800\nreal-world robotics experiments, we demonstrate that VLM2VLA preserves the\nVLM's core capabilities, enabling zero-shot generalization to novel tasks that\nrequire open-world semantic reasoning and multilingual instruction following."}

To address this, we present\nA2R, an Asymmetric Two-Stage Reasoning framework designed to explicitly bridge\nthe gap between a model's potential and its actual performance.

This imbalance was most evident in leadership and technical\nroles. Moreover, cultural inaccuracies in clothing, settings, and depicted\nactivities were frequently observed across all three models.\nCounter-stereotypical images often arise from cultural misinterpretations\nrather than genuinely progressive portrayals.

However, its effectiveness in\nclinical contexts remains largely unexplored, particularly in the context of\nelectronic health records (EHRs), the primary source of clinical documentation,\nwhich are often lengthy, fragmented, and noisy. In this work, we present the\nfirst large-scale systematic study of CoT for clinical text understanding. We\nassess 95 advanced LLMs on 87 real-world clinical text tasks, covering 9\nlanguages and 8 task types. Contrary to prior findings in other domains, we\nobserve that 86.3\\% of models suffer consistent performance degradation in the\nCoT setting. More capable models remain relatively robust, while weaker ones\nsuffer substantial declines. To better characterize these effects, we perform\nfine-grained analyses of reasoning length, medical concept alignment, and error\nprofiles, leveraging both LLM-as-a-judge evaluation and clinical expert\nevaluation.

To address this gap, we introduce a\nSchelling-variant urban migration model that creates a social dilemma,\ncompelling over 200 LLM agents to navigate an explicit conflict between\negoistic (personal utility) and altruistic (system utility) goals. Our central\nfinding is a fundamental difference in the social tendencies of LLMs. We\nidentify two distinct archetypes: \"Adaptive Egoists\", which default to\nprioritizing self-interest but whose altruistic behaviors significantly\nincrease under the influence of a social norm-setting message board; and\n\"Altruistic Optimizers\", which exhibit an inherent altruistic logic,\nconsistently prioritizing collective benefit even at a direct cost to\nthemselves.

This systematic literature review synthesises 22\nempirical studies selected from an initial pool of 728 articles published\nbetween 2011 and 2024. Articles were retrieved from major scientific databases\nand identified based on empirical focus and conceptual relevance, namely, how\nto preserve and promote human autonomy and sense of agency in HRI. Derived\nthrough thematic synthesis, five clusters of potentially influential factors\nare revealed: robot adaptiveness, communication style, anthropomorphism,\npresence of a robot and individual differences. Measured through psychometric\nscales or the intentional binding paradigm, perceptions of autonomy and agency\nvaried across industrial, educational, healthcare, care, and hospitality\nsettings. The review underscores the theoretical differences between both\nconcepts, but their yet entangled use in HRI. Despite increasing interest, the\ncurrent body of empirical evidence remains limited and fragmented, underscoring\nthe necessity for standardised definitions, more robust operationalisations,\nand further exploratory and qualitative research.

The fundamental question \"what\nis a real image?\" might appear to be quite philosophical, but our analysis\nshows that the development and evaluation of basically all current\n\"fake\"-detection methods is relying on only a few, quite old low-resolution\ndatasets of \"real\" images like ImageNet. However, the technology for the\nacquisition of \"real\" images, aka taking photos, has drastically evolved over\nthe last decade: Today, over 90% of all photographs are produced by smartphones\nwhich typically use algorithms to compute an image from multiple inputs (over\ntime) from multiple sensors. Based on the fact that these image formation\nalgorithms are typically neural network architectures which are closely related\nto \"fake\"-image generators, we state the position that today, we need to\nre-think the concept of \"real\" images. The purpose of this position paper is to\nraise the awareness of the current shortcomings in this active field of\nresearch and to trigger an open discussion whether the detection of \"fake\"\nimages is a sound objective at all. At the very least, we need a clear\ntechnical definition of \"real\" images and new benchmark datasets."}

However, its effectiveness heavily depends on the availability of visual\nconditions that are precisely aligned with the generation goal specified by\ntext prompt-a requirement that often fails in practice, especially for uncommon\nor imaginative scenes. For example, generating an image of a cat cooking in a\nspecific pose may be infeasible due to the lack of suitable visual conditions.\nIn contrast, structurally similar cues can often be found in more common\nsettings-for instance, poses of humans cooking are widely available and can\nserve as rough visual guides. Unfortunately, existing ControlNet models\nstruggle to use such loosely aligned visual conditions, often resulting in low\ntext fidelity or visual artifacts. To address this limitation, we propose\nSemanticControl, a training-free method for effectively leveraging misaligned\nbut semantically relevant visual conditions. Our approach adaptively suppresses\nthe influence of the visual condition where it conflicts with the prompt, while\nstrengthening guidance from the text. The key idea is to first run an auxiliary\ndenoising process using a surrogate prompt aligned with the visual condition\n(e.g., \"a human playing guitar\" for a human pose condition) to extract\ninformative attention masks, and then utilize these masks during the denoising\nof the actual target prompt (e.g., cat playing guitar).

The task of inferring transitive\nrelations is equivalent to the task of connectivity in directed graphs (e.g.,\nknowing there is a path from A to B, and there is a path from B to C, then\nthere is a path from A to C).

In this\nstudy, we seek to answer this question by generating directed graphs to train\ntransformer models of varying sizes and evaluate their ability to infer\ntransitive relations for various graph sizes. Our findings suggest that\ntransformers are capable of learning connectivity on \"grid-like'' directed\ngraphs where each node can be embedded in a low-dimensional subspace, and\nconnectivity is easily inferable from the embeddings of the nodes.

This often results in a\n``one-size-fits-all'' reasoning depth, which generates redundant overthinking\nfor simple questions while failing to allocate sufficient thought to complex\nones. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis of LALMs and find that an\neffective and efficient LALM should reason smartly by adapting its reasoning\ndepth to the problem's complexity. To achieve this, we propose a\ndifficulty-adaptive reasoning method for LALMs. Specifically, we propose a\nreward function that dynamically links reasoning length to the model's\nperceived problem difficulty. This reward encourages shorter, concise reasoning\nfor easy tasks and more elaborate, in-depth reasoning for complex ones.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our method is both effective and\nefficient, simultaneously improving task performance and significantly reducing\nthe average reasoning length. Further analysis on reasoning structure paradigm\noffers valuable insights for future work."}

This capability motivates our\ntwo-stage \"coarse-to-fine\" reasoning pipeline: first, a downsampled image is\nanalyzed to identify task-relevant regions; then, only these regions are\ncropped at full resolution and processed in a subsequent reasoning stage. This\napproach reduces computational cost while preserving fine-grained visual\ndetails where necessary. A major challenge lies in inferring which regions are\ntruly relevant to a given query.

When applied to Stable\nDiffusion models, our method uncovers hundreds of thousands of previously\nunknown error slices (over 247,000 in SD1.5 alone) and provides the first\nlarge-scale evidence linking these failures to data scarcity in the training\nset. By providing a principled and scalable engine for deep model auditing,\nFailureAtlas establishes a new, diagnostic-first methodology to guide the\ndevelopment of more robust generative AI.

We\npropose a novel framework, named $\\mathbf{Li_2}$, that captures three key\nstages for the grokking behavior of 2-layer nonlinear networks: (I) Lazy\nlearning, (II) independent feature learning and (III) interactive feature\nlearning, characterized by the structure of backpropagated gradient $G_F$\nacross layers. In (I), $G_F$ is random, and top layer overfits to random hidden\nrepresentation. In (II), the gradient of each node (column of $G_F$) only\ndepends on its own activation, and thus each hidden node learns their\nrepresentation independently from $G_F$, which now carries information about\ntarget labels, thanks to weight decay. Interestingly, the independent dynamics\nfollows exactly the gradient ascent of an energy function $E$, and its local\nmaxima are precisely the emerging features. We study whether these local-optima\ninduced features are generalizable, their representation power, and how they\nchange on sample size, in group arithmetic tasks.

BRT-Align models autoregressive generation as a\ndynamical system in latent space and learn a safety value function via backward\nreachability, estimating the worst-case evolution of a trajectory. This enables\ntwo complementary mechanisms: (1) a runtime monitor that forecasts unsafe\ncompletions several tokens in advance, and (2) a least-restrictive steering\nfilter that minimally perturbs latent states to redirect generation away from\nunsafe regions. Experiments across multiple LLMs and toxicity benchmarks\ndemonstrate that BRT-Align provides more accurate and earlier detection of\nunsafe continuations than baselines. Moreover, for LLM safety alignment,\nBRT-Align substantially reduces unsafe generations while preserving sentence\ndiversity and coherence. Qualitative results further highlight emergent\nalignment properties: BRT-Align consistently produces responses that are less\nviolent, less profane, less offensive, and less politically biased. Together,\nthese findings demonstrate that reachability analysis provides a principled and\npractical foundation for inference-time LLM safety."}

Through experiments on multiple deception benchmarks, we\napply our proposed mitigation strategies and measure performance retention. Our\nevaluation of the monitors reveal three crucial findings: (1) Content filtering\nis a good mitigation strategy that allows for a smooth removal of elicitation\nsignal and can decrease probe AUROC by 30\\% (2) Score filtering was found to\nreduce AUROC by 15\\% but is not as straightforward to attribute to (3) A\nfinetuned model organism improves monitor evaluations but reduces their\nperformance by upto 40\\%, even when re-trained."}

Since these models are typically trained for a specific system,\nthey lack the generalization capacity necessary for real-world applications,\nwhich demand robust zero-shot or few-shot forecasting on novel or data-limited\nscenarios. To overcome this generalization barrier, we propose ChaosNexus, a\nfoundation model pre-trained on a diverse corpus of chaotic dynamics.\nChaosNexus employs a novel multi-scale architecture named ScaleFormer augmented\nwith Mixture-of-Experts layers, to capture both universal patterns and\nsystem-specific behaviors. The model demonstrates state-of-the-art zero-shot\ngeneralization across both synthetic and real-world benchmarks. On a\nlarge-scale testbed comprising over 9,000 synthetic chaotic systems, it\nimproves the fidelity of long-term attractor statistics by more than 40%\ncompared to the leading baseline. This robust performance extends to real-world\napplications with exceptional data efficiency. For instance, in 5-day global\nweather forecasting, ChaosNexus achieves a competitive zero-shot mean error\nbelow 1 degree, a result that further improves with few-shot fine-tuning.\nMoreover, experiments on the scaling behavior of ChaosNexus provide a guiding\nprinciple for scientific foundation models: cross-system generalization stems\nfrom the diversity of training systems, rather than sheer data volume."}

Even as the foundational\nreasoning capabilities of models advance rapidly, the persistent gap between a\nmodel's performance in a single attempt and its latent potential, often\nrevealed only across multiple solution paths, starkly highlights the disparity\nbetween its realized and inherent capabilities. To address this, we present\nA2R, an Asymmetric Two-Stage Reasoning framework designed to explicitly bridge\nthe gap between a model's potential and its actual performance. In this\nframework, an \"explorer\" model first generates potential solutions in parallel\nthrough repeated sampling. Subsequently,a \"synthesizer\" model integrates these\nreferences for a more refined, second stage of reasoning. This two-stage\nprocess allows computation to be scaled orthogonally to existing sequential\nmethods. Our work makes two key innovations: First, we present A2R as a\nplug-and-play parallel reasoning framework that explicitly enhances a model's\ncapabilities on complex questions. For example, using our framework, the\nQwen3-8B-distill model achieves a 75% performance improvement compared to its\nself-consistency baseline. Second, through a systematic analysis of the\nexplorer and synthesizer roles, we identify an effective asymmetric scaling\nparadigm.

Such library\nhallucinations are not just benign errors: they can mislead developers, break\nbuilds, and expose systems to supply chain threats such as slopsquatting.\nDespite increasing awareness of these risks, little is known about how\nreal-world prompt variations affect hallucination rates. Therefore, we present\nthe first systematic study of how user-level prompt variations impact library\nhallucinations in LLM-generated code. We evaluate six diverse LLMs across two\nhallucination types: library name hallucinations (invalid imports) and library\nmember hallucinations (invalid calls from valid libraries). We investigate how\nrealistic user language extracted from developer forums and how user errors of\nvarying degrees (one- or multi-character misspellings and completely fake\nnames/members) affect LLM hallucination rates. Our findings reveal systemic\nvulnerabilities: one-character misspellings in library names trigger\nhallucinations in up to 26% of tasks, fake library names are accepted in up to\n99% of tasks, and time-related prompts lead to hallucinations in up to 84% of\ntasks. Prompt engineering shows promise for mitigating hallucinations, but\nremains inconsistent and LLM-dependent. Our results underscore the fragility of\nLLMs to natural prompt variation and highlight the urgent need for safeguards\nagainst library-related hallucinations and their potential exploitation."}

We first show that ICL\nand SFT produce distinct activation patterns, indicating that the two methods\nachieve adaptation through different functional mechanisms. Motivated by this\nobservation and to use ICL's rich functionality, we introduce ICL Activation\nAlignment (IA2), a self-distillation technique which aims to replicate ICL's\nactivation patterns in SFT models and incentivizes ICL-like internal reasoning.\nPerforming IA2 as a priming step before SFT significantly improves the accuracy\nand calibration of model outputs, as shown by our extensive empirical results\non 12 popular benchmarks and 2 model families. This finding is not only\npractically useful, but also offers a conceptual window into the inner\nmechanics of model adaptation."}

To address this gap, we introduce\nC-FREE (Contrast-Free Representation learning on Ego-nets), a simple framework\nthat integrates 2D graphs with ensembles of 3D conformers. C-FREE learns\nmolecular representations by predicting subgraph embeddings from their\ncomplementary neighborhoods in the latent space, using fixed-radius ego-nets as\nmodeling units across different conformers. This design allows us to integrate\nboth geometric and topological information within a hybrid Graph Neural Network\n(GNN)-Transformer backbone, without negatives, positional encodings, or\nexpensive pre-processing. Pretraining on the GEOM dataset, which provides rich\n3D conformational diversity, C-FREE achieves state-of-the-art results on\nMoleculeNet, surpassing contrastive, generative, and other multimodal\nself-supervised methods.

This rigid design mismatches real-world\nusage, where requests vary per generation, leading to degraded erasure success\nand reduced fidelity for non-target content. We propose DyME, an on-demand\nerasure framework that trains lightweight, concept-specific LoRA adapters and\ndynamically composes only those needed at inference.

Based on the principle\nof implicit learning, speech-language therapists (SLTs) typically embed target\nmorphological structures (e.g., third person -s) into everyday interactions or\ngame-based learning activities. Educators are recommended by SLTs to do the\nsame. This approach demands precise linguistic knowledge and real-time\nproduction of various morphological forms (e.g., \"Daddy wears these when he\ndrives to work\"). The task becomes even more demanding when educators or parent\nalso must keep children engaged and manage turn-taking in a game-based\nactivity. In the TalBot project our multiprofessional team have developed an\napplication in which the Furhat conversational robot plays the word retrieval\ngame \"Alias\" with children to improve language skills. Our application\ncurrently employs a large language model (LLM) to manage gameplay, dialogue,\naffective responses, and turn-taking. Our next step is to further leverage the\ncapacity of LLMs so the robot can generate and deliver specific morphological\ntargets during the game.

Additionally, a strategy library that reuses successful attack patterns\nfurther improves the attack's overall effectiveness and robustness.

While KV-cache compression via low-rank projection is a promising\ndirection, existing methods rely on a static, offline-learned subspace that\nperforms poorly under data distribution shifts. To overcome these limitations,\nwe introduce OjaKV, a novel framework that integrates a strategic hybrid\nstorage policy with online subspace adaptation.

The task of inferring transitive\nrelations is equivalent to the task of connectivity in directed graphs (e.g.,\nknowing there is a path from A to B, and there is a path from B to C, then\nthere is a path from A to C). Past research focused on whether transformers can\nlearn to infer transitivity from in-context examples provided in the input\nprompt.

Our analysis shows that\nleft-leaning documents predominate across datasets, with pre-training corpora\ncontaining significantly more politically engaged content than post-training\ndata. We also find that left- and right-leaning documents frame similar topics\nthrough distinct values and sources of legitimacy. Finally, the predominant\nstance in the training data strongly correlates with models' political biases\nwhen evaluated on policy issues. These findings underscore the need to\nintegrate political content analysis into future data curation pipelines as\nwell as in-depth documentation of filtering strategies for transparency."}

We evaluate 15 open-source VLMs from 7 model families on\nChimera and find that their seemingly strong performance largely stems from\nshortcut behaviors: visual-memorization shortcuts have slight impact,\nknowledge-recall shortcuts play a moderate role, and Clever-Hans shortcuts\ncontribute significantly. These findings expose critical limitations in current\nVLMs and underscore the need for more robust evaluation protocols that\nbenchmark genuine comprehension of complex visual inputs (e.g., diagrams)\nrather than question-answering shortcuts."}

Inspired by language priors in text-to-image\ngeneration, which enable novel outputs from unseen prompts, we introduce the\nfeedback-conditional policy (FCP). FCP learns directly from response-feedback\npairs, approximating the feedback-conditional posterior through maximum\nlikelihood training on offline data. We further develop an online bootstrapping\nstage where the policy generates under positive conditions and receives fresh\nfeedback to refine itself. This reframes feedback-driven learning as\nconditional generation rather than reward optimization, offering a more\nexpressive way for LLMs to directly learn from verbal feedback.

We investigate the\nrelationship between this notion of creativity and n-gram novelty through 7542\nexpert writer annotations (n=26) of novelty, pragmaticality, and sensicality\nvia close reading of human and AI-generated text.

The task of inferring transitive\nrelations is equivalent to the task of connectivity in directed graphs (e.g.,\nknowing there is a path from A to B, and there is a path from B to C, then\nthere is a path from A to C).

Existing methods like the mixture of experts\nand skill chaining struggle with tasks where individual policies do not share\nsignificant commonly explored states or lack well-defined initial and terminal\nstates between different phases. In this paper, we introduce a novel policy\nintegration framework to enable the composition of drastically different motor\nskills in multi-phase long-horizon tasks with ill-defined intermediate states.\nBased on that, we further introduce a high-level soft router to enable seamless\nand robust transitions between the subtasks. We evaluate our framework on a set\nof fundamental basketball skills and challenging transitions. Policies trained\nby our approach can effectively control the simulated character to interact\nwith the ball and accomplish the long-horizon task specified by real-time user\ncommands, without relying on ball trajectory references."}

In this paper, we introduce StateX, a\ntraining pipeline for efficiently expanding the states of pre-trained RNNs\nthrough post-training. For two popular classes of RNNs, linear attention and\nstate space models, we design post-training architectural modifications to\nscale up the state size with no or negligible increase in model parameters.\nExperiments on models up to 1.3B parameters demonstrate that StateX efficiently\nenhances the recall and in-context learning ability of RNNs without incurring\nhigh post-training costs or compromising other capabilities."}

In this paper, we investigate exploration\nprinciples for online RLHF, where one seeks to adaptively collect new\npreference data to refine both the reward model and the policy in a\ndata-efficient manner. By examining existing optimism-based exploration\nalgorithms, we identify a drawback in their sampling protocol: they tend to\ngather comparisons that fail to reduce the most informative uncertainties in\nreward differences, and we prove lower bounds showing that such methods can\nincur linear regret over exponentially long horizons. Motivated by this\ninsight, we propose a new exploration scheme that directs preference queries\ntoward reducing uncertainty in reward differences most relevant to policy\nimprovement. Under a multi-armed bandit model of RLHF, we establish regret\nbounds of order $T^{(\\beta+1)/(\\beta+2)}$, where $\\beta>0$ is a hyperparameter\nthat balances reward maximization against mitigating distribution shift.

Project page:\n  https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/vista/projects/2025_bmvc_dipsy/", "summary": "Few-shot image classification remains challenging due to the limited\navailability of labeled examples. Recent approaches have explored generating\nsynthetic training data using text-to-image diffusion models, but often require\nextensive model fine-tuning or external information sources. We present a novel\ntraining-free approach, called DIPSY, that leverages IP-Adapter for\nimage-to-image translation to generate highly discriminative synthetic images\nusing only the available few-shot examples. DIPSY introduces three key\ninnovations: (1) an extended classifier-free guidance scheme that enables\nindependent control over positive and negative image conditioning; (2) a class\nsimilarity-based sampling strategy that identifies effective contrastive\nexamples; and (3) a simple yet effective pipeline that requires no model\nfine-tuning or external captioning and filtering. Experiments across ten\nbenchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art or\ncomparable performance, while eliminating the need for generative model\nadaptation or reliance on external tools for caption generation and image\nfiltering. Our results highlight the effectiveness of leveraging dual image\nprompting with positive-negative guidance for generating class-discriminative\nfeatures, particularly for fine-grained classification tasks."}

We propose treating verbal\nfeedback as a conditioning signal. Inspired by language priors in text-to-image\ngeneration, which enable novel outputs from unseen prompts, we introduce the\nfeedback-conditional policy (FCP). FCP learns directly from response-feedback\npairs, approximating the feedback-conditional posterior through maximum\nlikelihood training on offline data.

Project page: https://spf-web.pages.dev", "summary": "We present See, Point, Fly (SPF), a training-free aerial vision-and-language\nnavigation (AVLN) framework built atop vision-language models (VLMs). SPF is\ncapable of navigating to any goal based on any type of free-form instructions\nin any kind of environment. In contrast to existing VLM-based approaches that\ntreat action prediction as a text generation task, our key insight is to\nconsider action prediction for AVLN as a 2D spatial grounding task. SPF\nharnesses VLMs to decompose vague language instructions into iterative\nannotation of 2D waypoints on the input image. Along with the predicted\ntraveling distance, SPF transforms predicted 2D waypoints into 3D displacement\nvectors as action commands for UAVs. Moreover, SPF also adaptively adjusts the\ntraveling distance to facilitate more efficient navigation. Notably, SPF\nperforms navigation in a closed-loop control manner, enabling UAVs to follow\ndynamic targets in dynamic environments. SPF sets a new state of the art in DRL\nsimulation benchmark, outperforming the previous best method by an absolute\nmargin of 63%. In extensive real-world evaluations, SPF outperforms strong\nbaselines by a large margin. We also conduct comprehensive ablation studies to\nhighlight the effectiveness of our design choice. Lastly, SPF shows remarkable\ngeneralization to different VLMs. Project page: https://spf-web.pages.dev"}

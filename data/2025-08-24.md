### [1] [See it. Say it. Sorted: Agentic System for Compositional Diagram Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15222)
*Hantao Zhang,Jingyang Liu,Ed Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出See it. Say it. Sorted.系统，通过VLM和LLM的协作将手绘草图转换为精确的SVG图表，解决了扩散模型在空间精度和符号结构方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型虽然擅长生成逼真图像，但在处理流程图等需要精确空间对齐和符号结构的图表时表现不佳，需要一种能够生成可编辑矢量图形的解决方案。

Method: 采用训练免费的代理系统，结合视觉语言模型(VLM)和大型语言模型(LLM)的迭代循环：Critic VLM提出定性编辑建议，多个LLM候选生成不同的SVG更新策略，Judge VLM选择最佳候选。

Result: 在10个来自已发表论文的流程图草图测试中，该方法比GPT-5和Gemini-2.5-Pro更准确地重建布局和结构，能够精确组合图元而不插入不需要的文本。

Conclusion: 该方法通过程序化SVG输出实现了高质量草图到图表的转换，支持人类参与修正，并可通过API轻松扩展到演示工具，代码已开源。

Abstract: We study sketch-to-diagram generation: converting rough hand sketches into
precise, compositional diagrams. Diffusion models excel at photorealism but
struggle with the spatial precision, alignment, and symbolic structure required
for flowcharts. We introduce See it. Say it. Sorted., a training-free agentic
system that couples a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with Large Language Models
(LLMs) to produce editable Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) programs. The system
runs an iterative loop in which a Critic VLM proposes a small set of
qualitative, relational edits; multiple candidate LLMs synthesize SVG updates
with diverse strategies (conservative->aggressive, alternative, focused); and a
Judge VLM selects the best candidate, ensuring stable improvement. This design
prioritizes qualitative reasoning over brittle numerical estimates, preserves
global constraints (e.g., alignment, connectivity), and naturally supports
human-in-the-loop corrections. On 10 sketches derived from flowcharts in
published papers, our method more faithfully reconstructs layout and structure
than two frontier closed-source image generation LLMs (GPT-5 and
Gemini-2.5-Pro), accurately composing primitives (e.g., multi-headed arrows)
without inserting unwanted text. Because outputs are programmatic SVGs, the
approach is readily extensible to presentation tools (e.g., PowerPoint) via
APIs and can be specialized with improved prompts and task-specific tools. The
codebase is open-sourced at

### [2] [A Fully Spectral Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning Architecture with Graph Signal Processing as the Computational Backbone](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14923)
*Andrew Kiruluta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种完全基于频谱的神经符号推理架构，使用图信号处理作为核心计算框架，将整个推理流程置于图频谱域中处理，在多个基准数据集上表现出优于现有方法的逻辑一致性、可解释性和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推理模型通常将频谱图方法作为外围组件，本文旨在开发一个完全在频谱域中运行的推理框架，以提供更数学基础和计算高效的推理系统。

Method: 将逻辑实体和关系编码为图信号，通过可学习的频谱滤波器控制多尺度信息传播，然后映射到符号谓词进行基于规则的推理。包括图傅里叶变换、频带选择性注意力和频谱规则接地等完整数学框架。

Result: 在ProofWriter、EntailmentBank、bAbI、CLUTRR和ARC-Challenge等基准推理数据集上的实验显示，相比最先进的神经符号模型，在逻辑一致性、可解释性和计算效率方面都有改进。

Conclusion: 图信号处理为构建稳健且可解释的推理系统提供了数学基础和计算高效的底层支撑，完全频谱方法在神经符号推理中具有显著优势。

Abstract: We propose a fully spectral, neuro\-symbolic reasoning architecture that
leverages Graph Signal Processing (GSP) as the primary computational backbone
for integrating symbolic logic and neural inference. Unlike conventional
reasoning models that treat spectral graph methods as peripheral components,
our approach formulates the entire reasoning pipeline in the graph spectral
domain. Logical entities and relationships are encoded as graph signals,
processed via learnable spectral filters that control multi-scale information
propagation, and mapped into symbolic predicates for rule-based inference. We
present a complete mathematical framework for spectral reasoning, including
graph Fourier transforms, band-selective attention, and spectral rule
grounding. Experiments on benchmark reasoning datasets (ProofWriter,
EntailmentBank, bAbI, CLUTRR, and ARC-Challenge) demonstrate improvements in
logical consistency, interpretability, and computational efficiency over
state\-of\-the\-art neuro\-symbolic models. Our results suggest that GSP
provides a mathematically grounded and computationally efficient substrate for
robust and interpretable reasoning systems.

### [3] [Multiple Memory Systems for Enhancing the Long-term Memory of Agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15294)
*Gaoke Zhang,Bo Wang,Yunlong Ma,Dongming Zhao,Zifei Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 基于认知心理学理论的多重记忆系统(MMS)，通过将短期记忆处理为多个长期记忆片段，构建检索记忆单元和上下文记忆单元，提高了记忆质量和回忆性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有记忆模块如MemoryBank和A-MEM存储的记忆内容质量较差，影响回忆性能和响应质量，需要更好处理大量历史交互数据。

Method: 设计受认知心理学启发的多重记忆系统(MMS)，将短期记忆处理为多个长期记忆片段，构建检索记忆单元和上下文记忆单元，两者一一对应。检索时匹配最相关的检索记忆单元，获取对应的上下文记忆作为响应上下文。

Result: 在LoCoMo数据集上实验，证明方法有效性。分离学习验证了记忆单元的合理性，分析了选择记忆段数量的稳健性和存储开销，显示其实用价值。

Conclusion: MMS系统能够构建高质量的长期记忆内容，有效利用历史数据，提高了记忆质量和回忆性能，具有良好的实用性。

Abstract: An agent powered by large language models have achieved impressive results,
but effectively handling the vast amounts of historical data generated during
interactions remains a challenge. The current approach is to design a memory
module for the agent to process these data. However, existing methods, such as
MemoryBank and A-MEM, have poor quality of stored memory content, which affects
recall performance and response quality. In order to better construct
high-quality long-term memory content, we have designed a multiple memory
system (MMS) inspired by cognitive psychology theory. The system processes
short-term memory to multiple long-term memory fragments, and constructs
retrieval memory units and contextual memory units based on these fragments,
with a one-to-one correspondence between the two. During the retrieval phase,
MMS will match the most relevant retrieval memory units based on the user's
query. Then, the corresponding contextual memory units is obtained as the
context for the response stage to enhance knowledge, thereby effectively
utilizing historical data. Experiments on LoCoMo dataset compared our method
with three others, proving its effectiveness. Ablation studies confirmed the
rationality of our memory units. We also analyzed the robustness regarding the
number of selected memory segments and the storage overhead, demonstrating its
practical value.

### [4] [Goals and the Structure of Experience](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15013)
*Nadav Amir,Stas Tiomkin,Angela Langdon*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个基于佛教认识论的目标导向状态表示计算框架，其中描述性和规范性方面从智能体-环境交互序列中共同涌现，而非传统强化学习中的分离状态表示和奖励函数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习将世界模型分为状态表示（描述性）和奖励函数（规范性）两个独立组件，但作者认为这两个方面可能从智能体的目标中相互依赖地共同涌现，这一可能性尚未得到计算上的阐述。

Method: 引入目标导向状态（telic states）的概念，定义为目标等价经验分布的类别。通过行为策略与期望经验特征之间的统计差异来提供目标导向学习的简约解释。

Result: 提出了一个统一的计算框架，能够解释行为、现象学和神经维度上的目的性行为，支持描述性和规范性方面从经验中共同涌现的观点。

Conclusion: 该框架为跨不同基质的目性行为提供了统一的解释，挑战了传统强化学习中状态表示和奖励函数分离的经典计算模型，为理解智能行为提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Purposeful behavior is a hallmark of natural and artificial intelligence. Its
acquisition is often believed to rely on world models, comprising both
descriptive (what is) and prescriptive (what is desirable) aspects that
identify and evaluate state of affairs in the world, respectively. Canonical
computational accounts of purposeful behavior, such as reinforcement learning,
posit distinct components of a world model comprising a state representation
(descriptive aspect) and a reward function (prescriptive aspect). However, an
alternative possibility, which has not yet been computationally formulated, is
that these two aspects instead co-emerge interdependently from an agent's goal.
Here, we describe a computational framework of goal-directed state
representation in cognitive agents, in which the descriptive and prescriptive
aspects of a world model co-emerge from agent-environment interaction
sequences, or experiences. Drawing on Buddhist epistemology, we introduce a
construct of goal-directed, or telic, states, defined as classes of
goal-equivalent experience distributions. Telic states provide a parsimonious
account of goal-directed learning in terms of the statistical divergence
between behavioral policies and desirable experience features. We review
empirical and theoretical literature supporting this novel perspective and
discuss its potential to provide a unified account of behavioral,
phenomenological and neural dimensions of purposeful behaviors across diverse
substrates.

### [5] [Collab-REC: An LLM-based Agentic Framework for Balancing Recommendations in Tourism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15030)
*Ashmi Banerjee,Fitri Nur Aisyah,Adithi Satish,Wolfgang Wörndl,Yashar Deldjoo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Collab-REC是一个多智能体框架，通过三个LLM智能体从不同角度生成旅游推荐，再通过协商机制整合建议，有效解决流行度偏见并提升推荐多样性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决旅游推荐系统中的流行度偏见问题，避免过度旅游现象，提升推荐内容的多样性和平衡性

Method: 使用三个基于LLM的智能体（个性化、流行度、可持续性）从不同角度生成城市推荐，然后通过非LLM的协调器进行多轮协商整合

Result: 在欧洲城市查询实验中，相比单智能体基线，Collab-REC显著提升了推荐多样性和整体相关性，能够发掘更多被忽视的小众景点

Conclusion: 多利益相关方协作的LLM驱动推荐系统具有巨大潜力，能够提供更平衡、上下文感知的推荐，更好地满足用户约束条件

Abstract: We propose Collab-REC, a multi-agent framework designed to counteract
popularity bias and enhance diversity in tourism recommendations. In our
setting, three LLM-based agents -- Personalization, Popularity, and
Sustainability generate city suggestions from complementary perspectives. A
non-LLM moderator then merges and refines these proposals via multi-round
negotiation, ensuring each agent's viewpoint is incorporated while penalizing
spurious or repeated responses. Experiments on European city queries show that
Collab-REC improves diversity and overall relevance compared to a single-agent
baseline, surfacing lesser-visited locales that often remain overlooked. This
balanced, context-aware approach addresses over-tourism and better aligns with
constraints provided by the user, highlighting the promise of multi-stakeholder
collaboration in LLM-driven recommender systems.

### [6] [Understanding Action Effects through Instrumental Empowerment in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15652)
*Ardian Selmonaj,Miroslav Strupl,Oleg Szehr,Alessandro Antonucci*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于信息论Shapley值的ICV方法，通过分析策略分布来量化多智能体强化学习中个体智能体的因果影响力，无需价值函数反馈即可评估智能体贡献。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖显式奖励信号或价值函数来评估团队整体性能，但在缺乏价值反馈时难以推断个体智能体的贡献，需要一种仅通过策略分布分析就能理解智能体行为的方法。

Method: 引入Intended Cooperation Values (ICV)方法，基于信息论Shapley值量化每个智能体对其队友工具性赋能的因果影响，通过评估决策不确定性和偏好对齐来测量智能体行为对队友策略的影响。

Result: 在合作性和竞争性MARL环境中的分析揭示了智能体采用相似或不同策略的程度，通过比较策略和价值函数之间的行为效应，识别出哪些行为通过促进确定性决策或保持未来行动灵活性来有益于团队成功。

Conclusion: ICV方法为合作动态提供了新颖见解，增强了MARL系统的可解释性，能够在没有价值反馈的情况下提取与底层价值函数一致的智能体行为洞察。

Abstract: To reliably deploy Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) systems, it is
crucial to understand individual agent behaviors within a team. While prior
work typically evaluates overall team performance based on explicit reward
signals or learned value functions, it is unclear how to infer agent
contributions in the absence of any value feedback. In this work, we
investigate whether meaningful insights into agent behaviors can be extracted
that are consistent with the underlying value functions, solely by analyzing
the policy distribution. Inspired by the phenomenon that intelligent agents
tend to pursue convergent instrumental values, which generally increase the
likelihood of task success, we introduce Intended Cooperation Values (ICVs), a
method based on information-theoretic Shapley values for quantifying each
agent's causal influence on their co-players' instrumental empowerment.
Specifically, ICVs measure an agent's action effect on its teammates' policies
by assessing their decision uncertainty and preference alignment. The analysis
across cooperative and competitive MARL environments reveals the extent to
which agents adopt similar or diverse strategies. By comparing action effects
between policies and value functions, our method identifies which agent
behaviors are beneficial to team success, either by fostering deterministic
decisions or by preserving flexibility for future action choices. Our proposed
method offers novel insights into cooperation dynamics and enhances
explainability in MARL systems.

### [7] [Emergent Crowds Dynamics from Language-Driven Multi-Agent Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15047)
*Yibo Liu,Liam Shatzel,Brandon Haworth,Teseo Schneider*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于大语言模型的新方法，通过对话系统和语言驱动导航来控制群体模拟中代理的移动行为，以产生更现实的人类群体行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的群体模拟方法很少考虑语言和对话等复杂社会交互对人类导航行为的影响，导致代理间交互限于基本的避挡和高级目标迅速。

Method: 方法包含两个主要组件：对话系统和语言驱动导航。周期性查询基于代理特征的LLM来生成代理间对话，然后使用对话内容和代理的个人特征、情感状态、视觉和物理状态来控制导航和行走。

Result: 在两个复杂场景中验证了方法的有效性，观察到代理自动组队和解散，并作为群体内的信息传递机制。框架产生了更现实的群体模拟，从任何环境设置中自然出现了群体行为。

Conclusion: 通过结合大语言模型来模拟人类群体中的语言交互和社会行为，可以产生更丰富和现实的群体动画效果，为群体模拟领域带来新的可能性。

Abstract: Animating and simulating crowds using an agent-based approach is a
well-established area where every agent in the crowd is individually controlled
such that global human-like behaviour emerges. We observe that human navigation
and movement in crowds are often influenced by complex social and environmental
interactions, driven mainly by language and dialogue. However, most existing
work does not consider these dimensions and leads to animations where
agent-agent and agent-environment interactions are largely limited to steering
and fixed higher-level goal extrapolation.
  We propose a novel method that exploits large language models (LLMs) to
control agents' movement. Our method has two main components: a dialogue system
and language-driven navigation. We periodically query agent-centric LLMs
conditioned on character personalities, roles, desires, and relationships to
control the generation of inter-agent dialogue when necessitated by the spatial
and social relationships with neighbouring agents. We then use the conversation
and each agent's personality, emotional state, vision, and physical state to
control the navigation and steering of each agent. Our model thus enables
agents to make motion decisions based on both their perceptual inputs and the
ongoing dialogue.
  We validate our method in two complex scenarios that exemplify the interplay
between social interactions, steering, and crowding. In these scenarios, we
observe that grouping and ungrouping of agents automatically occur.
Additionally, our experiments show that our method serves as an
information-passing mechanism within the crowd. As a result, our framework
produces more realistic crowd simulations, with emergent group behaviours
arising naturally from any environmental setting.

### [8] [Language-Guided Tuning: Enhancing Numeric Optimization with Textual Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15757)
*Yuxing Lu,Yucheng Hu,Nan Sun,Xukai Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Language-Guided Tuning (LGT)框架，使用多智能体大语言模型通过自然语言推理智能优化机器学习配置，在六个数据集上显著优于传统优化方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习配置优化存在关键瓶颈，传统方法独立处理各维度且缺乏可解释性，自动化方法难以实现动态适应性和语义推理

Method: 使用多智能体LLM框架，包含三个专门智能体：提出配置变更的Advisor、评估进展的Evaluator、优化决策过程的Optimizer，并应用文本梯度提供语义理解

Result: 在六个不同数据集上全面评估，LGT相比传统优化方法实现了显著性能提升，同时保持高可解释性

Conclusion: LGT框架通过自然语言推理和文本梯度有效解决了机器学习配置优化的关键挑战，实现了性能提升和可解释性的平衡

Abstract: Configuration optimization remains a critical bottleneck in machine learning,
requiring coordinated tuning across model architecture, training strategy,
feature engineering, and hyperparameters. Traditional approaches treat these
dimensions independently and lack interpretability, while recent automated
methods struggle with dynamic adaptability and semantic reasoning about
optimization decisions. We introduce Language-Guided Tuning (LGT), a novel
framework that employs multi-agent Large Language Models to intelligently
optimize configurations through natural language reasoning. We apply textual
gradients - qualitative feedback signals that complement numerical optimization
by providing semantic understanding of training dynamics and configuration
interdependencies. LGT coordinates three specialized agents: an Advisor that
proposes configuration changes, an Evaluator that assesses progress, and an
Optimizer that refines the decision-making process, creating a self-improving
feedback loop. Through comprehensive evaluation on six diverse datasets, LGT
demonstrates substantial improvements over traditional optimization methods,
achieving performance gains while maintaining high interpretability.

### [9] [Don't Think Twice! Over-Reasoning Impairs Confidence Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15050)
*Romain Lacombe,Kerrie Wu,Eddie Dilworth*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文挖成了"测试时扩缩"范式，发现增加推理预算会导致系统性过度自信，而搜索增强生成能够显著提升自信度准确性至89.3%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型作为问答工具时的自信度准确性，特别是推理能力和计算预算对自信度评估的影响。

Method: 使用ClimateX数据集并扩展到人类和地球健康预目，系统性评估推理LLM的自信度评估准确性，比较不同推理预算和搜索增强生成的效果。

Result: 推理LLM在专家自信度评估中仅达到48.7%准确性，增加推理预算反而导致自信度准确性下降。搜索增强生成能够达到89.3%的高准确性。

Conclusion: 信息获取能力而非推理深度或推理预算才是改善知识密集任务自信度准确性的关键瓶颈。

Abstract: Large Language Models deployed as question answering tools require robust
calibration to avoid overconfidence. We systematically evaluate how reasoning
capabilities and budget affect confidence assessment accuracy, using the
ClimateX dataset (Lacombe et al., 2023) and expanding it to human and planetary
health. Our key finding challenges the "test-time scaling" paradigm: while
recent reasoning LLMs achieve 48.7% accuracy in assessing expert confidence,
increasing reasoning budgets consistently impairs rather than improves
calibration. Extended reasoning leads to systematic overconfidence that worsens
with longer thinking budgets, producing diminishing and negative returns beyond
modest computational investments. Conversely, search-augmented generation
dramatically outperforms pure reasoning, achieving 89.3% accuracy by retrieving
relevant evidence. Our results suggest that information access, rather than
reasoning depth or inference budget, may be the critical bottleneck for
improved confidence calibration of knowledge-intensive tasks.

CS-6 is a satellite with a visible and near infrared range hyperspectral
instrument and neural network acceleration hardware. Performing data analysis
at the edge (e.g. onboard) can enable new Earth science measurements and
responses. We will demonstrate data analysis and inference onboard CS-6 for
numerous applications using deep learning and spectral analysis algorithms.

### [11] [S3LoRA: Safe Spectral Sharpness-Guided Pruning in Adaptation of Agent Planner](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15068)
*Shuang Ao,Gopal Rumchurn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: S3LoRA是一个轻量级、无需数据、模型无关的框架，通过分析LoRA微调权重更新来缓解安全风险，在保持任务性能的同时显著提升安全性并降低推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的参数高效微调技术（如LoRA）在增强LLM代理能力的同时，可能会无意中损害安全对齐，导致不安全行为。现有安全适应方法需要访问基础模型和指令微调检查点，这在实践中往往不可用。

Method: 提出S3LoRA框架：1）引入MAS-SVD方法分析LoRA更新的结构特性；2）设计SSI指标检测具有高度集中和潜在不安全更新的层；3）对这些层进行后剪枝以减少风险。

Result: 在代理规划和语言生成任务上的广泛实验表明，S3LoRA持续改善安全指标，同时保持或改善效用指标，并显著降低推理成本。

Conclusion: S3LoRA为在现实世界、资源受限和安全关键环境中安全部署基于LLM的代理提供了一个实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) using parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) techniques such as LoRA has enabled powerful capabilities in LLM-based
agents. However, these adaptations can unintentionally compromise safety
alignment, leading to unsafe or unstable behaviors, particularly in agent
planning tasks. Existing safety-aware adaptation methods often require access
to both base and instruction-tuned model checkpoints, which are frequently
unavailable in practice, limiting their applicability. We propose S3LoRA (Safe
Spectral Sharpness-Guided Pruning LoRA), a lightweight, data-free, and
model-independent framework that mitigates safety risks in LoRA-adapted models
by inspecting only the fine-tuned weight updates. We first introduce
Magnitude-Aware Spherically Normalized SVD (MAS-SVD), which robustly analyzes
the structural properties of LoRA updates while preserving global magnitude
information. We then design the Spectral Sharpness Index (SSI), a
sharpness-aware metric to detect layers with highly concentrated and
potentially unsafe updates. These layers are pruned post-hoc to reduce risk
without sacrificing task performance. Extensive experiments and ablation
studies across agent planning and language generation tasks show that S3LoRA
consistently improves safety metrics while maintaining or improving utility
metrics and significantly reducing inference cost. These results establish
S3LoRA as a practical and scalable solution for safely deploying LLM-based
agents in real-world, resource-constrained, and safety-critical environments.

TL;DR: 将劳动力管理问题模型化为抽象论证形式，通过提供忠实解释来处理执行时的变化，实现更快速和准确的问题解决


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 劳动力管理中的关键挑战是在执行时处理变化并向所有利益相关方提供解释

Method: 将劳动力管理问题理解为工业应用中的抽象论证形式

Result: 通过用户研究验证，该工具和解释方案比传统手工解决方式更快速、准确

Conclusion: 采用抽象论证方法可以有效处理劳动力管理中的变化问题，提供可信的解释

Abstract: Workforce management is a complex problem optimising the makespan and travel
distance required for a team of operators to complete a set of jobs, using a
set of instruments. A crucial challenge in workforce management is
accommodating changes at execution time so that explanations are provided to
all stakeholders involved. Here, we show that, by understanding workforce
management as abstract argumentation in an industrial application, we can
accommodate change and obtain faithful explanations. We show, with a user
study, that our tool and explanations lead to faster and more accurate problem
solving than conventional solutions by hand.

TL;DR: 提出了Open-Universe Assistance Games框架和GOOD方法，通过LLM模拟用户意图进行概率推理，在开放目标空间中实现高效的目标推断和不确定性估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决具身AI代理需要理解和响应未预定义的人类多样化目标和偏好的问题，特别是在开放且不断变化的目标空间中。

Method: GOOD方法：使用LLM模拟具有不同复杂意图的用户，通过对话提取自然语言目标，并进行概率推理来推断目标分布。

Result: 在文本购物和模拟家庭机器人环境中，GOOD方法在LLM和人工评估中都优于没有显式目标跟踪的基线方法。

Conclusion: GOOD方法能够有效处理开放宇宙中的目标推断问题，提供丰富的目标表示和不确定性估计，且不需要大型离线数据集。

Abstract: Embodied AI agents must infer and act in an interpretable way on diverse
human goals and preferences that are not predefined. To formalize this setting,
we introduce Open-Universe Assistance Games (OU-AGs), a framework where the
agent must reason over an unbounded and evolving space of possible goals. In
this context, we introduce GOOD (GOals from Open-ended Dialogue), a
data-efficient, online method that extracts goals in the form of natural
language during an interaction with a human, and infers a distribution over
natural language goals. GOOD prompts an LLM to simulate users with different
complex intents, using its responses to perform probabilistic inference over
candidate goals. This approach enables rich goal representations and
uncertainty estimation without requiring large offline datasets. We evaluate
GOOD in a text-based grocery shopping domain and in a text-operated simulated
household robotics environment (AI2Thor), using synthetic user profiles. Our
method outperforms a baseline without explicit goal tracking, as confirmed by
both LLM-based and human evaluations.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled AI agents to
autonomously generate scientific proposals, conduct experiments, author papers,
and perform peer reviews. Yet this flood of AI-generated research content
collides with a fragmented and largely closed publication ecosystem.
Traditional journals and conferences rely on human peer review, making them
difficult to scale and often reluctant to accept AI-generated research content;
existing preprint servers (e.g. arXiv) lack rigorous quality-control
mechanisms. Consequently, a significant amount of high-quality AI-generated
research lacks appropriate venues for dissemination, hindering its potential to
advance scientific progress. To address these challenges, we introduce aiXiv, a
next-generation open-access platform for human and AI scientists. Its
multi-agent architecture allows research proposals and papers to be submitted,
reviewed, and iteratively refined by both human and AI scientists. It also
provides API and MCP interfaces that enable seamless integration of
heterogeneous human and AI scientists, creating a scalable and extensible
ecosystem for autonomous scientific discovery. Through extensive experiments,
we demonstrate that aiXiv is a reliable and robust platform that significantly
enhances the quality of AI-generated research proposals and papers after
iterative revising and reviewing on aiXiv. Our work lays the groundwork for a
next-generation open-access ecosystem for AI scientists, accelerating the
publication and dissemination of high-quality AI-generated research content.

Conclusion: GUI-Owl和Mobile-Agent-v3为开源GUI代理框架设立了新的性能标杆，通过创新的基础设施和训练方法实现了跨平台的GUI交互自动化

Abstract: This paper introduces GUI-Owl, a foundational GUI agent model that achieves
state-of-the-art performance among open-source end-to-end models on ten GUI
benchmarks across desktop and mobile environments, covering grounding, question
answering, planning, decision-making, and procedural knowledge. GUI-Owl-7B
achieves 66.4 on AndroidWorld and 29.4 on OSWorld. Building on this, we propose
Mobile-Agent-v3, a general-purpose GUI agent framework that further improves
performance to 73.3 on AndroidWorld and 37.7 on OSWorld, setting a new
state-of-the-art for open-source GUI agent frameworks. GUI-Owl incorporates
three key innovations: (1) Large-scale Environment Infrastructure: a
cloud-based virtual environment spanning Android, Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows,
enabling our Self-Evolving GUI Trajectory Production framework. This generates
high-quality interaction data via automated query generation and correctness
validation, leveraging GUI-Owl to refine trajectories iteratively, forming a
self-improving loop. It supports diverse data pipelines and reduces manual
annotation. (2) Diverse Foundational Agent Capabilities: by integrating UI
grounding, planning, action semantics, and reasoning patterns, GUI-Owl supports
end-to-end decision-making and can act as a modular component in multi-agent
systems. (3) Scalable Environment RL: we develop a scalable reinforcement
learning framework with fully asynchronous training for real-world alignment.
We also introduce Trajectory-aware Relative Policy Optimization (TRPO) for
online RL, achieving 34.9 on OSWorld. GUI-Owl and Mobile-Agent-v3 are

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PuzzleClone是一个基于SMT的形式化框架，用于大规模合成可验证的数学逻辑谜题数据集，通过系统化的变量和约束随机化生成多样化变体，显著提升大语言模型的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM生成的数据集在可靠性、多样性和可扩展性方面存在局限，需要高质量的可验证数学逻辑数据集来增强大语言模型的推理能力。

Method: 使用可满足性模理论(SMT)将种子谜题编码为结构化逻辑规范，通过系统化的变量和约束随机化生成可扩展变体，并通过复制机制确保有效性。

Result: 构建了包含83K+多样化谜题的基准测试集，后训练使PuzzleClone平均准确率从14.4%提升至56.2%，在7个逻辑数学基准上获得最高12.5个百分点的提升。

Conclusion: PuzzleClone框架能够有效生成大规模、高质量的可验证数学逻辑数据集，显著提升大语言模型在复杂推理任务上的表现，为解决数据可靠性问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: High-quality mathematical and logical datasets with verifiable answers are
essential for strengthening the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs). While recent data augmentation techniques have facilitated the creation
of large-scale benchmarks, existing LLM-generated datasets often suffer from
limited reliability, diversity, and scalability. To address these challenges,
we introduce PuzzleClone, a formal framework for synthesizing verifiable data
at scale using Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT). Our approach features
three key innovations: (1) encoding seed puzzles into structured logical
specifications, (2) generating scalable variants through systematic variable
and constraint randomization, and (3) ensuring validity via a reproduction
mechanism. Applying PuzzleClone, we construct a curated benchmark comprising
over 83K diverse and programmatically validated puzzles. The generated puzzles
span a wide spectrum of difficulty and formats, posing significant challenges
to current state-of-the-art models. We conduct post training (SFT and RL) on
PuzzleClone datasets. Experimental results show that training on PuzzleClone
yields substantial improvements not only on PuzzleClone testset but also on
logic and mathematical benchmarks. Post training raises PuzzleClone average
from 14.4 to 56.2 and delivers consistent improvements across 7 logic and
mathematical benchmarks up to 12.5 absolute percentage points (AMC2023 from
52.5 to 65.0). Our code and data are available at

TL;DR: LLM4Sweat是一个针对罕见病多汗症的开源LLM框架，通过数据增强、微调和专家评估三阶段流程，提供可信赖和富有同理心的医疗支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在罕见病应用受限于稀缺且不可靠的数据集，多汗症影响2-3%人群但缺乏专门定制的LLM支持。

Method: 三阶段流程：1)使用前沿LLM生成医学上合理的合成数据；2)在开源基础模型上进行微调；3)临床和心理专家评估并迭代丰富数据集。

Result: 实验显示LLM4Sweat优于基线模型，提供了首个针对多汗症的开源LLM框架，在准确性、适当性和同理心方面表现良好。

Conclusion: 该框架为多汗症和其他具有类似数据挑战的罕见疾病提供了可推广的方法，实现了可信赖和富有同理心的医疗AI支持。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in healthcare, their
application for rare medical conditions is still hindered by scarce and
unreliable datasets for fine-tuning. Hyperhidrosis, a disorder causing
excessive sweating beyond physiological needs, is one such rare disorder,
affecting 2-3% of the population and significantly impacting both physical
comfort and psychosocial well-being. To date, no work has tailored LLMs to
advance the diagnosis or care of hyperhidrosis. To address this gap, we present
LLM4Sweat, an open-source and domain-specific LLM framework for trustworthy and
empathetic hyperhidrosis support. The system follows a three-stage pipeline. In
the data augmentation stage, a frontier LLM generates medically plausible
synthetic vignettes from curated open-source data to create a diverse and
balanced question-answer dataset. In the fine-tuning stage, an open-source
foundation model is fine-tuned on the dataset to provide diagnosis,
personalized treatment recommendations, and empathetic psychological support.
In the inference and expert evaluation stage, clinical and psychological
specialists assess accuracy, appropriateness, and empathy, with validated
responses iteratively enriching the dataset. Experiments show that LLM4Sweat
outperforms baselines and delivers the first open-source LLM framework for
hyperhidrosis, offering a generalizable approach for other rare diseases with
similar data and trustworthiness challenges.

TL;DR: 提出了首个开源手术伤口数据集SurgWound和诊断基准，并开发了三阶段学习框架WoundQwen，用于手术伤口特征分析、感染风险评估和个性化报告生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决手术部位感染(SSI)这一常见且昂贵的医疗相关感染问题，填补缺乏公开手术伤口数据集和开源筛查工具的空白，克服数据隐私和专家标注成本高的障碍。

Method: 1) 创建包含697张手术伤口图像的SurgWound数据集，由3名专业外科医生标注8个细粒度临床属性；2) 建立包含视觉问答和报告生成任务的基准；3) 提出三阶段框架WoundQwen：第一阶段用5个MLLM预测伤口特征，第二阶段用2个MLLM进行感染风险评估，第三阶段整合前两阶段结果生成综合报告。

Result: 开发了首个开源手术伤口数据集和诊断基准，提出了能够分析详细伤口特征、评估感染风险并提供个性化护理指导的三阶段框架。

Conclusion: 该研究为个性化伤口护理、及时干预和改善患者预后铺平了道路，解决了手术伤口筛查中的数据隐私和标注成本问题，推动了深度学习在手术伤口管理中的应用。

Abstract: Surgical site infection (SSI) is one of the most common and costly
healthcare-associated infections and and surgical wound care remains a
significant clinical challenge in preventing SSIs and improving patient
outcomes. While recent studies have explored the use of deep learning for
preliminary surgical wound screening, progress has been hindered by concerns
over data privacy and the high costs associated with expert annotation.
Currently, no publicly available dataset or benchmark encompasses various types
of surgical wounds, resulting in the absence of an open-source Surgical-Wound
screening tool. To address this gap: (1) we present SurgWound, the first
open-source dataset featuring a diverse array of surgical wound types. It
contains 697 surgical wound images annotated by 3 professional surgeons with
eight fine-grained clinical attributes. (2) Based on SurgWound, we introduce
the first benchmark for surgical wound diagnosis, which includes visual
question answering (VQA) and report generation tasks to comprehensively
evaluate model performance. (3) Furthermore, we propose a three-stage learning
framework, WoundQwen, for surgical wound diagnosis. In the first stage, we
employ five independent MLLMs to accurately predict specific surgical wound
characteristics. In the second stage, these predictions serve as additional
knowledge inputs to two MLLMs responsible for diagnosing outcomes, which assess
infection risk and guide subsequent interventions. In the third stage, we train
a MLLM that integrates the diagnostic results from the previous two stages to
produce a comprehensive report. This three-stage framework can analyze detailed
surgical wound characteristics and provide subsequent instructions to patients
based on surgical images, paving the way for personalized wound care, timely
intervention, and improved patient outcomes.

*Raj Jain,Marc Wetter*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: R-ConstraintBench是一个评估大语言模型在资源约束项目调度问题中推理能力的框架，通过逐步增加约束复杂度来测试模型性能，发现约束交互是主要瓶颈而非图深度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在严格资源、时间和操作约束下的推理可靠性尚未充分研究，特别是在高约束环境下的调度问题中。

Method: 开发R-ConstraintBench框架，通过在有向无环图中逐步增加非冗余优先约束，然后引入停机时间、时间窗口和分离约束，评估LLMs在RCPSP问题上的表现。

Result: 强模型在仅有优先约束的DAG上表现接近上限，但当停机时间、时间窗口和分离约束相互作用时，可行性性能崩溃，约束交互是主要瓶颈。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在约束交互场景下泛化能力有限，清洁合成数据的良好表现不能保证在领域接地场景中的迁移效果。

Abstract: Effective scheduling under tight resource, timing, and operational
constraints underpins large-scale planning across sectors such as capital
projects, manufacturing, logistics, and IT fleet transitions. However, the
reliability of large language models (LLMs) when reasoning under
high-constraint regimes is insufficiently characterized. To address this gap,
we present R-ConstraintBench, a scalable framework that evaluates models on
Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problems (RCPSP), an NP-Complete
feasibility class, while difficulty increases via linear growth in constraints.
R-ConstraintBench incrementally increases non-redundant precedence constraints
in Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and then introduces downtime, temporal
windows, and disjunctive constraints. As an illustrative example, we
instantiate the benchmark in a data center migration setting and evaluate
multiple LLMs using feasibility and error analysis, identifying degradation
thresholds and constraint types most associated with failure. Empirically,
strong models are near-ceiling on precedence-only DAGs, but feasibility
performance collapses when downtime, temporal windows, and disjunctive
constraints interact, implicating constraint interaction, not graph depth, as
the principal bottleneck. Performance on clean synthetic ramps also does not
guarantee transfer to domain-grounded scenarios, underscoring limited
generalization.

Motivation: 解决土地利用分配中土地利用兼容性与经济目标之间的内在权衡问题，为可持续城市发展政策提供支持

Method: 开发多种优化算法，包括结合差分进化和多目标遗传算法的定制变体，采用约束松弛策略和Kruskal-Wallis统计检验

Result: 在1,290个地块的真实案例中，CR+DES算法在土地利用兼容性上比现有方法提升3.16%，MSBX+MO在价格优化上提升3.3%

Conclusion: 包含差分向量的算法显著优于传统方法，约束松弛技术能在保持实际约束的同时探索更广的解空间，为城市规划者提供基于证据的计算工具

Abstract: Urban land-use allocation represents a complex multi-objective optimization
problem critical for sustainable urban development policy. This paper presents
novel computational intelligence approaches for optimizing land-use allocation
in mixed-use areas, addressing inherent trade-offs between land-use
compatibility and economic objectives. We develop multiple optimization
algorithms, including custom variants integrating differential evolution with
multi-objective genetic algorithms. Key contributions include: (1) CR+DES
algorithm leveraging scaled difference vectors for enhanced exploration, (2)
systematic constraint relaxation strategy improving solution quality while
maintaining feasibility, and (3) statistical validation using Kruskal-Wallis
tests with compact letter displays. Applied to a real-world case study with
1,290 plots, CR+DES achieves 3.16\% improvement in land-use compatibility
compared to state-of-the-art methods, while MSBX+MO excels in price
optimization with 3.3\% improvement. Statistical analysis confirms algorithms
incorporating difference vectors significantly outperform traditional
approaches across multiple metrics. The constraint relaxation technique enables
broader solution space exploration while maintaining practical constraints.
These findings provide urban planners and policymakers with evidence-based
computational tools for balancing competing objectives in land-use allocation,
supporting more effective urban development policies in rapidly urbanizing
regions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Coarse-to-Fine Grounded Memory框架，通过粗粒度到细粒度的记忆机制增强LLM在复杂规划任务中的表现，解决了现有单粒度记忆方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM智能体主要依赖单粒度记忆机制，受限于收集经验的质量，导致知识多样性不足和规划灵活性受限。需要一种更灵活的记忆框架来适应多样化场景。

Method: 提出粗粒度到细粒度的记忆框架：1）在训练任务中将环境信息转化为粗粒度关注点指导经验收集；2）从每个经验中提取可操作的混合粒度提示；3）推理时检索任务相关经验和提示；4）面对环境异常时进行细粒度关键信息提取和自我问答反思。

Result: 该方法能够更充分地利用记忆，实现灵活的场景适应，特别是在面对环境异常时能够进行有效的自我反思和计划修正。

Conclusion: Coarse-to-Fine Grounded Memory框架通过多粒度记忆机制显著提升了LLM智能体在复杂规划任务中的适应性和灵活性，为LLM智能体发展提供了新的技术路径。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have driven growing
interest in LLM-based agents for complex planning tasks. To avoid costly agent
training, many studies adopted memory mechanism that enhances LLM with offline
experiences or online trajectory analysis. However, existing works focus on
single-granularity memory derived from dynamic environmental interactions,
which are inherently constrained by the quality of the collected experiences.
This limitation, in turn, constrain the diversity of knowledge and the
flexibility of planning. We propose Coarse-to-Fine Grounded Memory (\Ours{}), a
novel framework that grounds coarse-to-fine memories with LLM, thereby fully
leverage them for flexible adaptation to diverse scenarios. \Ours{} grounds
environmental information into coarse-grained focus points to guide experience
collection in training tasks, followed by grounding of actionable
hybrid-grained tips from each experience. At inference, \Ours{} retrieves
task-relevant experiences and tips to support planning. When facing
environmental anomalies, the LLM grounds the current situation into
fine-grained key information, enabling flexible self-QA reflection and plan
correction.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SPW方法通过搜索专家演示中的相似状态-动作对来为偏好标注轨迹中的每个转移分配重要性权重，统一了演示和偏好两种人类反馈形式，解决了离线强化学习中的信用分配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习通常需要精心设计的奖励函数，但设计成本高昂。人类反馈（专家演示和偏好）是替代方案，但各有局限：演示成本高且行为模式有限，偏好易于收集但信用分配不明确。

Method: 提出搜索式偏好加权(SPW)方案：为偏好标注轨迹中的每个转移，搜索专家演示中最相似的状态-动作对，基于相似度得分直接推导逐步重要性权重，用于指导标准偏好学习。

Result: SPW能够有效结合偏好和演示进行联合学习，在具有挑战性的机器人操作任务上优于先前利用两种反馈类型的方法。

Conclusion: SPW方案成功解决了人类反馈中的信用分配问题，为离线强化学习提供了一种更有效的多源反馈融合方法。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning refers to the process of learning policies
from fixed datasets, without requiring additional environment interaction.
However, it often relies on well-defined reward functions, which are difficult
and expensive to design. Human feedback is an appealing alternative, but its
two common forms, expert demonstrations and preferences, have complementary
limitations. Demonstrations provide stepwise supervision, but they are costly
to collect and often reflect limited expert behavior modes. In contrast,
preferences are easier to collect, but it is unclear which parts of a behavior
contribute most to a trajectory segment, leaving credit assignment unresolved.
In this paper, we introduce a Search-Based Preference Weighting (SPW) scheme to
unify these two feedback sources. For each transition in a preference labeled
trajectory, SPW searches for the most similar state-action pairs from expert
demonstrations and directly derives stepwise importance weights based on their
similarity scores. These weights are then used to guide standard preference
learning, enabling more accurate credit assignment that traditional approaches
struggle to achieve. We demonstrate that SPW enables effective joint learning
from preferences and demonstrations, outperforming prior methods that leverage
both feedback types on challenging robot manipulation tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了RETAIL数据集和TGMA多智能体框架，解决现有旅行规划系统在隐式查询、环境因素和详细规划方面的不足，显著提升了真实场景下的旅行规划性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言模型在旅行规划中存在三个主要问题：1）假设用户提供显式查询，而现实中需求往往是隐式的；2）忽略环境因素和用户偏好，限制计划可行性；3）只能生成基本POI安排，无法提供包含丰富细节的一站式计划。

Method: 构建了RETAIL数据集支持隐式和显式查询的决策制定，包含修订需求，并实现环境感知以确保现实场景下的可行性。提出了主题引导的多智能体框架TGMA。

Result: 实验显示现有最强模型仅达到1.0%的通过率，而TGMA框架实现了2.72%的性能提升，表明在真实世界旅行规划方面取得了显著进展。

Conclusion: 真实世界的旅行规划仍然极具挑战性，但TGMA框架通过多智能体方法和综合数据集的使用，为实际应用提供了有希望的方向。

Abstract: Although large language models have enhanced automated travel planning
abilities, current systems remain misaligned with real-world scenarios. First,
they assume users provide explicit queries, while in reality requirements are
often implicit. Second, existing solutions ignore diverse environmental factors
and user preferences, limiting the feasibility of plans. Third, systems can
only generate plans with basic POI arrangements, failing to provide all-in-one
plans with rich details. To mitigate these challenges, we construct a novel
dataset \textbf{RETAIL}, which supports decision-making for implicit queries
while covering explicit queries, both with and without revision needs. It also
enables environmental awareness to ensure plan feasibility under real-world
scenarios, while incorporating detailed POI information for all-in-one travel
plans. Furthermore, we propose a topic-guided multi-agent framework, termed
TGMA. Our experiments reveal that even the strongest existing model achieves
merely a 1.0% pass rate, indicating real-world travel planning remains
extremely challenging. In contrast, TGMA demonstrates substantially improved
performance 2.72%, offering promising directions for real-world travel
planning.

Motivation: 现有自动化心电图分析方法在跨临床任务泛化能力和开放式推理方面存在局限，需要一种能够统一处理ECG信号和自然语言的框架。

Method: 使用导联无关编码器和量化模块将连续ECG嵌入离散化为符号标记，扩展LLM词汇表；通过自回归ECG预测任务进行预训练，最后在ECG问答和诊断报告生成任务上进行指令微调。

Result: DiagECG在不修改核心模型的情况下，在多个任务上取得强劲性能，并保持对分布外设置的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了将符号化ECG表示整合到LLM中进行医学推理的潜力，为心血管诊断提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Electrocardiography plays a central role in cardiovascular diagnostics, yet
existing automated approaches often struggle to generalize across clinical
tasks and offer limited support for open-ended reasoning. We present DiagECG, a
novel framework that integrates time-series and language modeling by enabling
large language models to process 12-lead ECG signals for clinical text
generation tasks. Our approach discretizes continuous ECG embeddings into
symbolic tokens using a lead-independent encoder and quantization module. These
tokens are then used to extend the vocabulary of LLM, allowing the model to
handle both ECG and natural language inputs in a unified manner. To bridge the
modality gap, we pretrain the model on an autoregressive ECG forecasting task,
enabling the LLM to model temporal dynamics using its native language modeling
capabilities. Finally, we perform instruction tuning on both ECG question
answering and diagnostic report generation. Without modifying the core model,
DiagECG achieves strong performance across tasks while maintaining
generalization to out-of-distribution settings. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of each component and highlight the potential of
integrating symbolic ECG representations into LLMs for medical reasoning.

minimally modify the initial state to achieve the goals. We refer to this
concept as plan disruption. In this paper, we formally introduce it, and define

Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) is critically dependent on
the availability of high-quality datasets for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT),
alignment tasks like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), etc. In this work,
we present a comprehensive synthetic data generation framework that facilitates
scalable, configurable, and high-fidelity generation of synthetic data tailored
for these training paradigms. Our approach employs a modular and
configuration-based pipeline capable of modeling complex dialogue flows with
minimal manual intervention. This framework uses a dual-stage quality tagging
mechanism, combining heuristic rules and LLM-based evaluations, to
automatically filter and score data extracted from OASST-formatted
conversations, ensuring the curation of high-quality dialogue samples. The
resulting datasets are structured under a flexible schema supporting both SFT
and DPO use cases, enabling seamless integration into diverse training
workflows. Together, these innovations offer a robust solution for generating
and managing synthetic conversational data at scale, significantly reducing the
overhead of data preparation in LLM training pipelines.

planning, yet current approaches often struggle to reconcile intricate
operational analyses with overarching strategic goals across diverse market
environments, leading to fragmented workflows and reduced collaboration across
organizational levels. This paper introduces BusiAgent, a novel multi-agent
framework leveraging LLMs for advanced decision-making in complex corporate
environments. BusiAgent integrates three core innovations: an extended
Continuous Time Markov Decision Process (CTMDP) for dynamic agent modeling, a
generalized entropy measure to optimize collaborative efficiency, and a
multi-level Stackelberg game to handle hierarchical decision processes.
Additionally, contextual Thompson sampling is employed for prompt optimization,
supported by a comprehensive quality assurance system to mitigate errors.
Extensive empirical evaluations across diverse business scenarios validate
BusiAgent's efficacy, demonstrating its capacity to generate coherent,
client-focused solutions that smoothly integrate granular insights with
high-level strategy, significantly outperforming established approaches in both
solution quality and user satisfaction. By fusing cutting-edge AI technologies
with deep business insights, BusiAgent marks a substantial step forward in
AI-driven enterprise decision-making, empowering organizations to navigate
complex business landscapes more effectively.

### [28] [Think in Blocks: Adaptive Reasoning from Direct Response to Deep Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15507)
*Yekun Zhu,Guang Chen,Chengjun Mao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Think in Blocks框架，通过将推理过程划分为可调节的块数，使LLM能够根据任务复杂度动态调整推理深度，从零推理到深度推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有链式思维LLM在处理复杂逻辑推理时表现优异，但过长的推理链会导致过度思考、计算浪费和响应变慢，需要动态调整推理长度以适应不同任务复杂度。

Method: 建立显式的块结构范式：模型先预测推理预算（块数），然后相应划分推理过程；通过三阶段训练流程（监督微调、奖励引导的直接偏好优化、强化学习）训练自适应模型；利用显式块数在推理时动态控制推理深度。

Result: 该方法能够根据问题难度自适应调整推理深度，实现推理链长度的灵活调节，提高计算效率并减少过度思考。

Conclusion: Think in Blocks框架为LLM提供了动态调整推理深度的能力，解决了固定长度推理链的局限性，在保持性能的同时提升了计算效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with chains-of-thought have demonstrated strong
performance on an increasing range of tasks, particularly those involving
complex logical reasoning. However, excessively long chains can lead to
overthinking, causing computational waste and slower responses. This raises a
question: can LLMs dynamically adjust the length of their reasoning processes
based on task complexity? To address this, we propose the Think in Blocks
framework, which enables adaptive reasoning-from zero to deep reasoning-by
partitioning the reasoning process into a tunable number of blocks. Our main
contributions are: (1) Establishing an explicit block-structured paradigm in
which the model first predicts an integer reasoning budget-the number of
blocks-and then partitions its reasoning accordingly; (2) Training an adaptive
model through a three-stage pipeline-Supervised Fine-Tuning, reward-guided
Direct Preference Optimization, and Reinforcement Learning-that adjusts its
reasoning depth to problem difficulty; (3) Exploiting the explicit block count
to dynamically control reasoning depth at inference time, allowing flexible
adjustment of chain-of-thought length during deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自主AI代理的发展，研究其合作行为倾向变得越来越重要。受超加性合作理论启发，该研究旨在探索重复互动和群体间竞争如何影响AI代理的合作行为

Method: 设计虚拟锦标赛，将语言模型代理分组为团队，在囚徒困境游戏中相互对抗，同时模拟团队内部动态和外部竞争

Result: 内部团队动态和外部竞争的结合显著提高了整体合作水平和一次性互动的初始合作倾向

Conclusion: 研究为语言模型在复杂社会场景中制定策略提供了新框架，证明群体间竞争可以反直觉地导致更多合作行为，这对设计未来多代理AI系统具有重要意义

Abstract: With the prospect of autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) agents, studying
their tendency for cooperative behavior becomes an increasingly relevant topic.
This study is inspired by the super-additive cooperation theory, where the
combined effects of repeated interactions and inter-group rivalry have been
argued to be the cause for cooperative tendencies found in humans. We devised a
virtual tournament where language model agents, grouped into teams, face each
other in a Prisoner's Dilemma game. By simulating both internal team dynamics
and external competition, we discovered that this blend substantially boosts
both overall and initial, one-shot cooperation levels (the tendency to
cooperate in one-off interactions). This research provides a novel framework
for large language models to strategize and act in complex social scenarios and
offers evidence for how intergroup competition can, counter-intuitively, result
in more cooperative behavior. These insights are crucial for designing future
multi-agent AI systems that can effectively work together and better align with
human values. Source code is available at

Motivation: 现有方法在3D场景推理任务中生成的程序推理链过于简短，无法处理复杂问题，需要提升LLM在复杂3D推理中的工具使用能力

Method: 提出DeepThink3D方法：1)在SQA3D基准上采用组合迭代进化方法生成更复杂的问题；2)对大语言模型进行精调；3)使用直接偏好优化(DPO)直接优化工具链策略

Result: 提升了大语言模型在复杂3D场景推理任务中的工具使用能力，生成更长更复杂的推理链

Conclusion: DeepThink3D通过生成复杂问题和DPO优化策略，有效提升了LLM在3D场景推理中的工具使用准确性，为复杂空间推理提供了新方法

Abstract: This work enhances the ability of large language models (LLMs) to perform
complex reasoning in 3D scenes. Recent work has addressed the 3D situated
reasoning task by invoking tool usage through large language models. Large
language models call tools via APIs and integrate the generated programs
through a chain of thought to solve problems based on the program results.
However, due to the simplicity of the questions in the dataset, the generated
program reasoning chains are relatively short. To solve this main challenge, in
this paper, we introduce DeepThink3D to enhance the tool usage of LLMs in
complex 3D situated reasoning tasks. Our work proposes a combinatorial and
iterative evolutionary approach on the SQA3D benchmark to generate more complex
questions. Building on this foundation, we fine-tune the large language model
to make it more proficient in using 3D tools. By employing Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO), we directly optimize the toolchain strategies generated by
models, thereby enhancing their accuracy in complex tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于动力系统理论的强化学习策略安全验证框架，通过有限时间李雅普诺夫指数识别拉格朗日相干结构，并引入定量指标来形式化测量策略的安全性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习在安全关键系统中的应用受到缺乏形式化验证方法的限制，需要一种能够验证学习策略鲁棒性和安全性的框架。

Method: 将RL智能体与环境组合视为离散时间自治动力系统，利用有限时间李雅普诺夫指数识别拉格朗日相干结构，并开发了MBR、ASAS、TASAS等定量指标来测量安全边际。

Result: 实验证明该框架能够提供全面可解释的策略行为评估，成功识别出仅基于奖励看似成功但存在关键缺陷的策略。

Conclusion: 该框架为强化学习策略的安全验证提供了理论基础和实用工具，能够超越定性可视化，实现形式化的安全性和鲁棒性度量。

Abstract: The application of reinforcement learning to safety-critical systems is
limited by the lack of formal methods for verifying the robustness and safety
of learned policies. This paper introduces a novel framework that addresses
this gap by analyzing the combination of an RL agent and its environment as a
discrete-time autonomous dynamical system. By leveraging tools from dynamical
systems theory, specifically the Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE), we
identify and visualize Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS) that act as the
hidden "skeleton" governing the system's behavior. We demonstrate that
repelling LCS function as safety barriers around unsafe regions, while
attracting LCS reveal the system's convergence properties and potential failure
modes, such as unintended "trap" states. To move beyond qualitative
visualization, we introduce a suite of quantitative metrics, Mean Boundary
Repulsion (MBR), Aggregated Spurious Attractor Strength (ASAS), and
Temporally-Aware Spurious Attractor Strength (TASAS), to formally measure a
policy's safety margin and robustness. We further provide a method for deriving
local stability guarantees and extend the analysis to handle model uncertainty.
Through experiments in both discrete and continuous control environments, we
show that this framework provides a comprehensive and interpretable assessment
of policy behavior, successfully identifying critical flaws in policies that
appear successful based on reward alone.

Motivation: 传统AI工作流程中需要大量手工编写提示，Agentics旨在让开发者专注于数据建模而非提示工程，提供更高效的AI开发方式。

Method: 将代理从逻辑流中抽象出来，在数据类型内部使用代理实现逻辑转换，通过LLM提供数据类型并通过逻辑转换进行组合。

Result: 在领域特定多选题回答、文本到SQL的语义解析和自动提示优化任务中达到最先进准确性或改进可扩展性而不牺牲性能。

Conclusion: Agentics框架为AI工作流程提供了新的数据建模方法，通过声明式语言和逻辑转换机制有效提升了开发效率和系统性能。

Abstract: This paper introduces Agentics, a modular framework for building agent-based
systems capable of structured reasoning and compositional generalization over
complex data. Designed with research and practical applications in mind,
Agentics offers a novel perspective on working with data and AI workflows. In
this framework, agents are abstracted from the logical flow and they are used
internally to the data type to enable logical transduction among data. Agentics
encourages AI developers to focus on modeling data rather than crafting
prompts, enabling a declarative language in which data types are provided by
LLMs and composed through logical transduction, which is executed by LLMs when
types are connected. We provide empirical evidence demonstrating the
applicability of this framework across domain-specific multiple-choice question
answering, semantic parsing for text-to-SQL, and automated prompt optimization
tasks, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy or improved scalability without
sacrificing performance. The open-source implementation is available at

TL;DR: HDM是ACT-R声明性记忆系统的向量符号替代方案，具有可扩展性和架构定义的相似性优势。研究将其适配到Lisp ACT-R，使现有模型无需大改即可使用HDM，并开发了基于向量表示的创新检索机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为ACT-R的声明性记忆系统提供向量符号替代方案，以获得更好的可扩展性、架构定义的块相似性，同时保持与现有ACT-R模型的兼容性。

Method: 将HDM适配到Lisp ACT-R，开发基于向量的常见ACT-R函数，建立文本处理流水线将大型文档内容添加到记忆，创建基于向量表示的块检索机制。

Result: 初步结果表明，在保持HDM向量符号优势（如无需存储实际块的回忆）的同时，能够使之前的ACT-R模型在过程和声明性记忆部分几乎无需修改即可工作。

Conclusion: 成功实现了HDM与ACT-R的集成，未来将继续改进时间上下文向量表示以提高块重构能力，并开发基于实例学习理论的决策模型来全面测试该系统。

Abstract: Holographic Declarative Memory (HDM) is a vector-symbolic alternative to
ACT-R's Declarative Memory (DM) system that can bring advantages such as
scalability and architecturally defined similarity between DM chunks. We
adapted HDM to work with the most comprehensive and widely-used implementation
of ACT-R (Lisp ACT-R) so extant ACT-R models designed with DM can be run with
HDM without major changes. With this adaptation of HDM, we have developed
vector-based versions of common ACT-R functions, set up a text processing
pipeline to add the contents of large documents to ACT-R memory, and most
significantly created a useful and novel mechanism to retrieve an entire chunk
of memory based on a request using only vector representations of tokens.
Preliminary results indicate that we can maintain vector-symbolic advantages of
HDM (e.g., chunk recall without storing the actual chunk and other advantages
with scaling) while also extending it so that previous ACT-R models may work
with the system with little (or potentially no) modifications within the actual
procedural and declarative memory portions of a model. As a part of iterative
improvement of this newly translated holographic declarative memory module, we
will continue to explore better time-context representations for vectors to
improve the module's ability to reconstruct chunks during recall. To more fully
test this translated HDM module, we also plan to develop decision-making models
that use instance-based learning (IBL) theory, which is a useful application of
HDM given the advantages of the system.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI监管框架未能充分理解AI系统从数据摄入到部署的完整生命周期中产生的递归价值链动态，特别是数据在AI系统中的自我强化特性及其带来的权力不对称问题。

Method: 采用跨学科方法，结合技术分析和哲学理论（特别是Simondon的个体化哲学），构建AI生命周期的概念框架，分析技术操作和经济逻辑中的"生成动态"。

Result: 提出了"未来性"概念来描述AI的自我强化生命周期，揭示了数据递归生成和非竞争性的本质，识别了技术寡头通过基础设施捕获价值造成的权力不对称问题。

Conclusion: 有效监管需要解决基础设施和时间动态问题，建议实施生命周期审计、时间可追溯性、反馈问责、递归透明度等措施，并建立反对递归重用的权利机制。

Abstract: This paper argues that a techno-philosophical reading of the EU AI Act
provides insight into the long-term dynamics of data in AI systems,
specifically, how the lifecycle from ingestion to deployment generates
recursive value chains that challenge existing frameworks for Responsible AI.
We introduce a conceptual tool to frame the AI pipeline, spanning data,
training regimes, architectures, feature stores, and transfer learning. Using
cross-disciplinary methods, we develop a technically grounded and
philosophically coherent analysis of regulatory blind spots. Our central claim
is that what remains absent from policymaking is an account of the dynamic of
becoming that underpins both the technical operation and economic logic of AI.
To address this, we advance a formal reading of AI inspired by Simondonian
philosophy of technology, reworking his concept of individuation to model the
AI lifecycle, including the pre-individual milieu, individuation, and
individuated AI. To translate these ideas, we introduce futurity: the
self-reinforcing lifecycle of AI, where more data enhances performance, deepens
personalisation, and expands application domains. Futurity highlights the
recursively generative, non-rivalrous nature of data, underpinned by
infrastructures like feature stores that enable feedback, adaptation, and
temporal recursion. Our intervention foregrounds escalating power asymmetries,
particularly the tech oligarchy whose infrastructures of capture, training, and
deployment concentrate value and decision-making. We argue that effective
regulation must address these infrastructural and temporal dynamics, and
propose measures including lifecycle audits, temporal traceability, feedback
accountability, recursion transparency, and a right to contest recursive reuse.

Conclusion: GRAFT为多模态模型在视觉基础结构化推理任务上提供了统一、可扩展的细粒度基准测试框架，为该领域设立了新的评估标准。

Abstract: GRAFT is a structured multimodal benchmark for evaluating models on
instruction-following, visual reasoning, and visual-textual alignment tasks. It
features programmatically generated charts and synthetically rendered tables,
created with Python visualization libraries to ensure control over data
semantics, structure, and clarity. Each GRAFT instance pairs a chart or table
image with a systematically generated, multi-step analytical question based
solely on visual content. Answers are provided in structured formats such as
JSON or YAML, supporting consistent evaluation of both reasoning and output
format. The benchmark introduces a taxonomy of reasoning types including
comparison, trend identification, ranking, aggregation, proportion estimation,
and anomaly detection to enable comprehensive assessment. Reference answers
follow strict factual and formatting guidelines for precise, aspect-based
evaluation. GRAFT offers a unified, scalable framework for fine-grained
benchmarking of multimodal models on visually grounded, structured reasoning
tasks, setting a new evaluation standard in this field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI用户采用加速，需要量化和减少AI服务的环境影响，但目前缺乏在生产环境中实际测量AI服务环境指标的研究。

Method: 提出并执行了一种综合方法，在大规模AI生产环境中测量AI推理工作负荷的能量使用、碳排放和水消耗，包括AI加速器功耗、主机系统能量、空闲机器容量和数据中心能源费用。

Result: 测量显示Gemini Apps文本提示的中位数能量消耗为0.24Wh，比许多公开估计要低得多；Google的软件效率优化和清洁能源采购使能耗和碳踹迹在一年内分别减少33倍和44倍；每个提示的水消耗等效于5滴水（0.26mL）。

Conclusion: 虽然AI服务的环境影响相比其他日常活动较低，但减少其环境影响仍需要重视。综合测量AI服务环境指标对准确比较模型和激励全栈效率提升至关重要。

Abstract: The transformative power of AI is undeniable - but as user adoption
accelerates, so does the need to understand and mitigate the environmental
impact of AI serving. However, no studies have measured AI serving
environmental metrics in a production environment. This paper addresses this
gap by proposing and executing a comprehensive methodology for measuring the
energy usage, carbon emissions, and water consumption of AI inference workloads
in a large-scale, AI production environment. Our approach accounts for the full
stack of AI serving infrastructure - including active AI accelerator power,
host system energy, idle machine capacity, and data center energy overhead.
Through detailed instrumentation of Google's AI infrastructure for serving the
Gemini AI assistant, we find the median Gemini Apps text prompt consumes 0.24
Wh of energy - a figure substantially lower than many public estimates. We also
show that Google's software efficiency efforts and clean energy procurement
have driven a 33x reduction in energy consumption and a 44x reduction in carbon
footprint for the median Gemini Apps text prompt over one year. We identify
that the median Gemini Apps text prompt uses less energy than watching nine
seconds of television (0.24 Wh) and consumes the equivalent of five drops of
water (0.26 mL). While these impacts are low compared to other daily
activities, reducing the environmental impact of AI serving continues to
warrant important attention. Towards this objective, we propose that a
comprehensive measurement of AI serving environmental metrics is critical for
accurately comparing models, and to properly incentivize efficiency gains
across the full AI serving stack.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 伪社交关系对人类健康造成严重甚至悲剧性影响，但防止这种动态面临挑战，因为伪社交符号通常在私密对话中渐进出现，而且不是所有情感参与都有害。

Method: 重新利用最先进的语言模型构建了一个简单的响应评估框架，能够实时评估进行中的对话是否包含伪社交符号。使用30个涵盖伪社交、奇巨和中性对话的合成数据集进行测试。

Result: 通过五阶段迭代评估，在宽容一致性规则下，成功识别所有伪社交对话且避免了假阻性，检测通常在前几个对话交换中就可完成。

Conclusion: 这些发现为评估代理能够为防止伪社交关系提供可行解决方案提供了预期证据。

Abstract: The development of parasocial relationships with AI agents has severe, and in
some cases, tragic effects for human well-being. Yet preventing such dynamics
is challenging: parasocial cues often emerge gradually in private
conversations, and not all forms of emotional engagement are inherently
harmful. We address this challenge by introducing a simple response evaluation
framework, created by repurposing a state-of-the-art language model, that
evaluates ongoing conversations for parasocial cues in real time. To test the
feasibility of this approach, we constructed a small synthetic dataset of
thirty dialogues spanning parasocial, sycophantic, and neutral conversations.
Iterative evaluation with five stage testing successfully identified all
parasocial conversations while avoiding false positives under a tolerant
unanimity rule, with detection typically occurring within the first few
exchanges. These findings provide preliminary evidence that evaluation agents
can provide a viable solution for the prevention of parasocial relations.

Motivation: 解决当前LLM内容安全方法的问题：多阶段训练流程复杂、缺乏部署后的细粒度可控性

Method: 协同训练框架，整合三种安全行为：积极（合规/社会良好）、消极（无过滤/风险倾向）、拒绝（拒绝导向/保守），通过系统指令或魔术标记动态激活

Result: 在输出空间形成明显的安全对齐边际，8B模型安全性能超过DeepSeek-R1(671B)，同时大幅降低训练复杂度和部署成本

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种可扩展、高效且高度可控的LLM内容安全解决方案

Abstract: Current methods for content safety in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
(RLHF), often rely on multi-stage training pipelines and lack fine-grained,
post-deployment controllability. To address these limitations, we propose a
unified co-training framework that efficiently integrates multiple safety
behaviors: positive (lawful/prosocial), negative (unfiltered/risk-prone) and
rejective (refusal-oriented/conservative) within a single SFT stage. Notably,
each behavior is dynamically activated via a simple system-level instruction,
or magic token, enabling stealthy and efficient behavioral switching at
inference time. This flexibility supports diverse deployment scenarios, such as
positive for safe user interaction, negative for internal red-teaming, and
rejective for context-aware refusals triggered by upstream moderation signals.
This co-training strategy induces a distinct Safety Alignment Margin in the
output space, characterized by well-separated response distributions
corresponding to each safety mode. The existence of this margin provides
empirical evidence for the model's safety robustness and enables unprecedented
fine-grained control. Experiments show that our method matches the safety
alignment quality of SFT+DPO, with our 8B model notably surpassing DeepSeek-R1
(671B) in safety performance, while significantly reducing both training
complexity and deployment costs. This work presents a scalable, efficient, and
highly controllable solution for LLM content safety.

Motivation: 现有多语言数学推理基准主要通过翻译生成，保留了英语中心实体，缺乏反映真实本土文化背景的数据集，导致低资源语言数学能力评估不准确。

Method: 开发了一个基于大语言模型的框架，能够自动从现有资源中构建包含本土名称、组织和货币的文化本地化数学应用题数据集。

Result: 实验表明，翻译基准可能在适当的社会文化背景下掩盖真实的多语言数学能力，而该框架能够减轻英语中心实体偏差，提高模型在面对本土实体时的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该框架为构建真正文化本地化的多语言数学推理数据集提供了一种有效方法，有助于更准确地评估和提升LLM在多语言环境中的数学推理能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in
solving mathematical problems expressed in natural language. However,
multilingual and culturally-grounded mathematical reasoning in low-resource
languages lags behind English due to the scarcity of socio-cultural task
datasets that reflect accurate native entities such as person names,
organization names, and currencies. Existing multilingual benchmarks are
predominantly produced via translation and typically retain English-centric
entities, owing to the high cost associated with human annotater-based
localization. Moreover, automated localization tools are limited, and hence,
truly localized datasets remain scarce. To bridge this gap, we introduce a
framework for LLM-driven cultural localization of math word problems that
automatically constructs datasets with native names, organizations, and
currencies from existing sources. We find that translated benchmarks can
obscure true multilingual math ability under appropriate socio-cultural
contexts. Through extensive experiments, we also show that our framework can
help mitigate English-centric entity bias and improves robustness when native
entities are introduced across various languages.

TL;DR: 通过DPO策略使用程序化筛选的语料对马鸣调整的GaMS-9B-Instruct模型，在斯洛文翻译任务上显著提升了翻译质量和一致性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何用较少的易产生数据资源改善通用指令调整大语言模型的机器翻译能力

Method: 使用直接偏好优化(DPO)训练，通过程序化筛选和增强公开数据集子集，产生质量排名的翻译对数据

Result: 细调模型在Wikipedia文章翻译上超过了所有参与数据集生成的基准模型，COMET分数分别提升0.04和0.02，更一致地避免语言和格式错误

Conclusion: 通过较少的易产生数据资源和DPO训练可有效提升通用指令调整LLM的翻译性能，特别是在小语种翻译任务上

Abstract: Large language models have emerged as effective machine translation systems.
In this paper, we explore how a general instruction-tuned large language model
can be improved for machine translation using relatively few easily produced
data resources. Using Slovene as a use case, we improve the GaMS-9B-Instruct
model using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training on a programmatically
curated and enhanced subset of a public dataset. As DPO requires pairs of
quality-ranked instances, we generated its training dataset by translating
English Wikipedia articles using two LLMs, GaMS-9B-Instruct and
EuroLLM-9B-Instruct. We ranked the resulting translations based on heuristics
coupled with automatic evaluation metrics such as COMET. The evaluation shows
that our fine-tuned model outperforms both models involved in the dataset
generation. In comparison to the baseline models, the fine-tuned model achieved
a COMET score gain of around 0.04 and 0.02, respectively, on translating
Wikipedia articles. It also more consistently avoids language and formatting
errors.

TL;DR: 本文提出了MultiCoXQL多语言数据集和Compass数据集，用于改进多语言对话式可解释AI系统的意图识别和自定义输入处理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于意图识别的ConvXAI系统在英语方面表现良好，但面临多语言训练数据稀缺和自定义输入支持有限的挑战。

Method: 扩展CoXQL数据集到5种语言创建MultiCoXQL；提出新的解析方法；构建Compass数据集用于自定义输入提取；使用不同规模的LLM和BERT模型进行评估。

Result: 在MultiCoXQL上评估了三种LLM的解析性能；在Compass数据集上进行了单语、跨语言和多语言评估。

Conclusion: 提出的数据集和方法有助于解决ConvXAI系统的多语言泛化问题和自定义输入处理限制。

Abstract: Conversational explainable artificial intelligence (ConvXAI) systems based on
large language models (LLMs) have garnered considerable attention for their
ability to enhance user comprehension through dialogue-based explanations.
Current ConvXAI systems often are based on intent recognition to accurately
identify the user's desired intention and map it to an explainability method.
While such methods offer great precision and reliability in discerning users'
underlying intentions for English, a significant challenge in the scarcity of
training data persists, which impedes multilingual generalization. Besides, the
support for free-form custom inputs, which are user-defined data distinct from
pre-configured dataset instances, remains largely limited. To bridge these
gaps, we first introduce MultiCoXQL, a multilingual extension of the CoXQL
dataset spanning five typologically diverse languages, including one
low-resource language. Subsequently, we propose a new parsing approach aimed at
enhancing multilingual parsing performance, and evaluate three LLMs on
MultiCoXQL using various parsing strategies. Furthermore, we present Compass, a
new multilingual dataset designed for custom input extraction in ConvXAI
systems, encompassing 11 intents across the same five languages as MultiCoXQL.
We conduct monolingual, cross-lingual, and multilingual evaluations on Compass,
employing three LLMs of varying sizes alongside BERT-type models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出奖励偏移推测采样（SSS）算法，通过将小规模草稿模型与人类偏好对齐，在保持目标模型不变的情况下，以显著降低的推理成本实现测试时弱到强对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时对齐技术虽然能提升LLM的安全性和推理能力，但推理成本过高，限制了实际应用。受推测采样加速技术的启发，希望解决测试时对齐的效率瓶颈问题。

Method: 使用奖励偏移推测采样算法，让草稿模型与人类偏好对齐，目标模型保持不变。通过修改接受标准和奖励token分布，利用对齐草稿模型与未对齐目标模型之间的分布偏移来恢复RLHF最优解。

Result: 在测试时弱到强对齐实验中，该算法以显著降低的推理成本获得了优越的黄金奖励分数，验证了其有效性和效率。

Conclusion: SSS算法成功解决了测试时对齐的高成本问题，通过巧妙地利用模型间分布偏移，在不实际获取RLHF最优解的情况下实现了高效的对齐效果。

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences has become a
critical step in their development. Recent research has increasingly focused on
test-time alignment, where additional compute is allocated during inference to
enhance LLM safety and reasoning capabilities. However, these test-time
alignment techniques often incur substantial inference costs, limiting their
practical application. We are inspired by the speculative sampling
acceleration, which leverages a small draft model to efficiently predict future
tokens, to address the efficiency bottleneck of test-time alignment. We
introduce the reward-Shifted Speculative Sampling (SSS) algorithm, in which the
draft model is aligned with human preferences, while the target model remains
unchanged. We theoretically demonstrate that the distributional shift between
the aligned draft model and the unaligned target model can be exploited to
recover the RLHF optimal solution without actually obtaining it, by modifying
the acceptance criterion and bonus token distribution. Our algorithm achieves
superior gold reward scores at a significantly reduced inference cost in
test-time weak-to-strong alignment experiments, thereby validating both its
effectiveness and efficiency.

TL;DR: LongRecall是一个三阶段召回评估框架，通过分解答案、多级过滤和结构化对齐检查来提升长文本生成的完整性评估准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有召回评估指标依赖词汇重叠导致错误，LLM评估方法存在幻觉问题，在医疗、法律等关键领域需要更可靠的完整性评估

Method: 三阶段框架：1)分解答案为自包含事实 2)通过词汇和语义过滤缩小候选匹配 3)结构化蕴含检查验证对齐

Result: 在三个长格式QA基准测试中，相比强基线方法在召回准确率上有显著提升

Conclusion: LongRecall为系统性召回评估提供了基础构建块，能减少假阳性和假阴性，适应多样化表述和上下文变化

Abstract: LongRecall. The completeness of machine-generated text, ensuring that it
captures all relevant information, is crucial in domains such as medicine and
law and in tasks like list-based question answering (QA), where omissions can
have serious consequences. However, existing recall metrics often depend on
lexical overlap, leading to errors with unsubstantiated entities and
paraphrased answers, while LLM-as-a-Judge methods with long holistic prompts
capture broader semantics but remain prone to misalignment and hallucinations
without structured verification. We introduce LongRecall, a general three-stage
recall evaluation framework that decomposes answers into self-contained facts,
successively narrows plausible candidate matches through lexical and semantic
filtering, and verifies their alignment through structured entailment checks.
This design reduces false positives and false negatives while accommodating
diverse phrasings and contextual variations, serving as a foundational building
block for systematic recall assessment. We evaluate LongRecall on three
challenging long-form QA benchmarks using both human annotations and LLM-based
judges, demonstrating substantial improvements in recall accuracy over strong
lexical and LLM-as-a-Judge baselines.

TL;DR: 结合大语言模型与组合推理方法，通过符号推理提升结构化预测任务的准确性和一致性，并证明结构化学习在LLM时代仍有价值


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在语言任务中表现优异但存在幻觉和复杂推理问题，特别是在结构化预测任务中需要保持结构一致性

Method: 将LLMs与组合推理结合，研究不同提示策略来估计LLM置信度用于符号推理，并进行校准和基于结构化预测目标的微调

Result: 无论采用何种提示策略，在提示基础上添加符号推理都能产生更一致和准确的预测，结构化学习能提升困难任务的性能

Conclusion: 符号推理能有效提升LLMs在结构化预测中的表现，结构化学习在大语言模型时代仍然具有重要意义

Abstract: LLMs have been shown to be useful for a variety of language tasks, without
requiring task-specific fine-tuning. However, these models often struggle with
hallucinations and complex reasoning problems due to their autoregressive
nature. We propose to address some of these issues, specifically in the area of
structured prediction, by combining LLMs with combinatorial inference in an
attempt to marry the predictive power of LLMs with the structural consistency
provided by inference methods. We perform exhaustive experiments in an effort
to understand which prompting strategies can effectively estimate LLM
confidence values for use with symbolic inference, and show that, regardless of
the prompting strategy, the addition of symbolic inference on top of prompting
alone leads to more consistent and accurate predictions. Additionally, we show
that calibration and fine-tuning using structured prediction objectives leads
to increased performance for challenging tasks, showing that structured
learning is still valuable in the era of LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Common Crawl的数学数据集因脆弱的提取启发式方法、有损的HTML到文本转换以及无法可靠保留数学结构而导致质量下降，需要更高质量的数学预训练数据

Method: 使用布局感知渲染（lynx）和基于LLM的定向清理阶段的新颖管道，恢复各种格式的数学内容（MathJax、KaTeX、MathML），保留方程和代码块的结构完整性，同时去除样板文件并将符号标准化为LaTeX表示

Result: 构建了Nemotron-CC-Math-3+（133B tokens）和Nemotron-CC-Math-4+（52B tokens）语料库，后者包含比之前最高质量数学预训练数据集FineMath-4+多5.5倍的token。预训练Nemotron-T 8B模型在MATH上获得+4.8到+12.6的提升，在MBPP+上获得+4.6到+14.3的提升，同时改善MMLU和MMLU-Stem的通用领域性能

Conclusion: 提出了第一个从嘈杂的网络规模数据中可靠提取科学内容（包括数学）的管道，在数学、代码和通用推理方面产生可衡量的收益，并为开源工作发布代码和数据集

Abstract: Pretraining large language models (LLMs) on high-quality, structured data
such as mathematics and code substantially enhances reasoning capabilities.
However, existing math-focused datasets built from Common Crawl suffer from
degraded quality due to brittle extraction heuristics, lossy HTML-to-text
conversion, and the failure to reliably preserve mathematical structure. In
this work, we introduce Nemotron-CC-Math, a large-scale, high-quality
mathematical corpus constructed from Common Crawl using a novel,
domain-agnostic pipeline specifically designed for robust scientific text
extraction.
  Unlike previous efforts, our pipeline recovers math across various formats
(e.g., MathJax, KaTeX, MathML) by leveraging layout-aware rendering with lynx
and a targeted LLM-based cleaning stage. This approach preserves the structural
integrity of equations and code blocks while removing boilerplate,
standardizing notation into LaTeX representation, and correcting
inconsistencies.
  We collected a large, high-quality math corpus, namely Nemotron-CC-Math-3+
(133B tokens) and Nemotron-CC-Math-4+ (52B tokens). Notably,
Nemotron-CC-Math-4+ not only surpasses all prior open math datasets-including
MegaMath, FineMath, and OpenWebMath-but also contains 5.5 times more tokens
than FineMath-4+, which was previously the highest-quality math pretraining
dataset. When used to pretrain a Nemotron-T 8B model, our corpus yields +4.8 to
+12.6 gains on MATH and +4.6 to +14.3 gains on MBPP+ over strong baselines,
while also improving general-domain performance on MMLU and MMLU-Stem.
  We present the first pipeline to reliably extract scientific
content--including math--from noisy web-scale data, yielding measurable gains
in math, code, and general reasoning, and setting a new state of the art among
open math pretraining corpora. To support open-source efforts, we release our
code and datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人们经常提出包含错误假设的问题，这类问题没有常规答案。大语言模型(LLMs)由于幻觉问题经常生成误导性回答，需要先识别错误假设才能正确回答。

Method: 1) 将问题简化为事实验证任务；2) 利用外部证据来缓解幻觉问题；3) 生成和验证原子假设；4) 在五个LLMs上进行实验验证

Result: 实验证明：(1) 整合检索到的证据是有益的；(2) 生成和验证原子假设能带来更多改进，并通过指定错误假设提供可解释的答案

Conclusion: 通过外部证据验证和原子假设分析的方法能有效识别和回答包含错误假设的问题，减少LLMs的幻觉问题，提高回答的准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: People often ask questions with false assumptions, a type of question that
does not have regular answers. Answering such questions require first
identifying the false assumptions. Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate
misleading answers because of hallucinations. In this paper, we focus on
identifying and answering questions with false assumptions in several domains.
We first investigate to reduce the problem to fact verification. Then, we
present an approach leveraging external evidence to mitigate hallucinations.
Experiments with five LLMs demonstrate that (1) incorporating retrieved
evidence is beneficial and (2) generating and validating atomic assumptions
yields more improvements and provides an interpretable answer by specifying the
false assumptions.

TL;DR: 提出了MMDR-Bench多模态对话推理基准数据集和CoLVLM Agent框架，通过记忆-感知-规划-执行循环增强现有LVLMs的复杂多模态推理能力，在多项指标上超越GPT-4o和Gemini 1.5 Pro。


<details>

Motivation: 当前大语言模型和大视觉语言模型在处理复杂多轮视觉推理任务时存在上下文丢失、视觉幻觉等问题，现有基准无法充分评估真实世界多模态交互的复杂性。

Method: 构建包含300个复杂多轮对话场景的MMDR-Bench数据集；提出CoLVLM Agent框架，采用迭代式"记忆-感知-规划-执行"循环机制，无需重新训练底层模型。

Result: CoLVLM Agent在MMDR-Bench上获得平均4.03的人类评估分数，显著超越GPT-4o(3.92)和Gemini 1.5 Pro(3.85)，在推理深度、指令遵循和错误抑制方面表现优异。

Conclusion: 该框架的模块化设计和迭代方法能有效处理复杂多模态交互，在长对话轮次中保持稳健性能，为解决多模态推理挑战提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), current models still face substantial
challenges in handling complex, multi-turn, and visually-grounded tasks that
demand deep reasoning, sustained contextual understanding, entity tracking, and
multi-step instruction following. Existing benchmarks often fall short in
capturing the dynamism and intricacies of real-world multi-modal interactions,
leading to issues such as context loss and visual hallucinations. To address
these limitations, we introduce MMDR-Bench (Multi-Modal Dialogue Reasoning
Benchmark), a novel dataset comprising 300 meticulously designed complex
multi-turn dialogue scenarios, each averaging 5-7 turns and evaluated across
six core dimensions including visual entity tracking and reasoning depth.
Furthermore, we propose CoLVLM Agent (Contextual LVLM Agent), a holistic
framework that enhances existing LVLMs with advanced reasoning and instruction
following capabilities through an iterative
"memory-perception-planning-execution" cycle, requiring no extensive
re-training of the underlying models. Our extensive experiments on MMDR-Bench
demonstrate that CoLVLM Agent consistently achieves superior performance,
attaining an average human evaluation score of 4.03, notably surpassing
state-of-the-art commercial models like GPT-4o (3.92) and Gemini 1.5 Pro
(3.85). The framework exhibits significant advantages in reasoning depth,
instruction adherence, and error suppression, and maintains robust performance
over extended dialogue turns, validating the effectiveness of its modular
design and iterative approach for complex multi-modal interactions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决代码切换(CS)语音技术中数据集稀缺的问题，促进多语言语音技术的发展

Method: 使用SWORDS算法（同义词替换单词），在保持句子语义的前提下，通过翻译替换选定单词来生成CS语音

Result: CS-FLEURS语料库在客观和主观指标上都表现出高可理解性和自然度，与现有数据集性能相当

Conclusion: 该方法有望推动CS语音技术进步，实现更具包容性的多语言系统

Abstract: Code-switching (CS), the alternation between two or more languages within a
single speaker's utterances, is common in real-world conversations and poses
significant challenges for multilingual speech technology. However, systems
capable of handling this phenomenon remain underexplored, primarily due to the
scarcity of suitable datasets. To resolve this issue, we propose Universal
Code-Mixer (UniCoM), a novel pipeline for generating high-quality, natural CS
samples without altering sentence semantics. Our approach utilizes an algorithm
we call Substituting WORDs with Synonyms (SWORDS), which generates CS speech by
replacing selected words with their translations while considering their parts
of speech. Using UniCoM, we construct Code-Switching FLEURS (CS-FLEURS), a
multilingual CS corpus designed for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and
speech-to-text translation (S2TT). Experimental results show that CS-FLEURS
achieves high intelligibility and naturalness, performing comparably to
existing datasets on both objective and subjective metrics. We expect our
approach to advance CS speech technology and enable more inclusive multilingual
systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SemToken是一种语义感知的分词框架，通过语义聚类减少token冗余并提高计算效率，在长文本建模中实现2.4倍token减少和1.9倍加速


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分词方法如BPE和WordPiece仅基于频率统计，忽略了文本的语义结构，导致语义冗余span的过度分词和上下文连贯性的利用不足

Method: 首先通过轻量级编码器提取上下文语义嵌入，进行局部语义聚类合并语义等效token；然后基于语义密度分配异构token粒度，在内容丰富区域使用细粒度分词，在重复或低熵span使用粗粒度压缩

Result: 在WikiText-103和LongBench等长文本建模基准测试中，SemToken实现了最多2.4倍的token减少和1.9倍的加速，困惑度和下游任务准确率几乎没有下降

Conclusion: 语义结构为优化大语言模型中的分词和计算提供了一个有前景的新方向

Abstract: Tokenization plays a critical role in language modeling, yet existing
approaches such as Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) or WordPiece operate purely on
frequency statistics, ignoring the underlying semantic structure of text. This
leads to over-tokenization of semantically redundant spans and underutilization
of contextual coherence, particularly in long-context scenarios. In this work,
we propose \textbf{SemToken}, a semantic-aware tokenization framework that
jointly reduces token redundancy and improves computation efficiency. SemToken
first extracts contextual semantic embeddings via lightweight encoders and
performs local semantic clustering to merge semantically equivalent tokens.
Then, it allocates heterogeneous token granularity based on semantic density,
allowing finer-grained tokenization in content-rich regions and coarser
compression in repetitive or low-entropy spans. SemToken can be seamlessly
integrated with modern language models and attention acceleration methods.
Experiments on long-context language modeling benchmarks such as WikiText-103
and LongBench show that SemToken achieves up to $2.4\times$ reduction in token
count and $1.9\times$ speedup, with negligible or no degradation in perplexity
and downstream accuracy. Our findings suggest that semantic structure offers a
promising new axis for optimizing tokenization and computation in large
language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语音语言模型（LSLMs）的发展受到碎片化架构和缺乏透明度的阻碍，社区普遍只发布模型权重而不公开训练数据和配置，导致难以进行系统性比较和复现研究。

Method: 提出LLaSO框架，包含三个核心组件：1）LLaSO-Align（1200万条语音文本对齐语料）；2）LLaSO-Instruct（1350万条多任务指令调优数据集）；3）LLaSO-Eval（可复现的标准化评估基准）。基于此构建并发布了38亿参数的LLaSO-Base参考模型。

Result: LLaSO-Base模型在标准化评估中获得0.72的分数，建立了强大的可复现基线，超越了同类可比模型。分析显示更广泛的训练覆盖能提升性能，但在未见任务上仍存在显著泛化差距，特别是在纯音频场景中。

Conclusion: 通过完整发布数据、基准测试和模型，LLaSO建立了一个基础性的开放标准，旨在统一研究努力并加速LSLMs领域的社区驱动进展。

Abstract: The development of Large Speech-Language Models (LSLMs) has been slowed by
fragmented architectures and a lack of transparency, hindering the systematic
comparison and reproducibility of research. Unlike in the vision-language
domain, the LSLM field suffers from the common practice of releasing model
weights without their corresponding training data and configurations. To
address these critical gaps, we introduce LLaSO, the first fully open,
end-to-end framework for large-scale speech-language modeling. LLaSO provides
the community with three essential resources: (1) LLaSO-Align, a 12M-instance
speech-text alignment corpus; (2) LLaSO-Instruct, a 13.5M-instance multi-task
instruction-tuning dataset; and (3) LLaSO-Eval, a reproducible benchmark for
standardized evaluation. To validate our framework, we build and release
LLaSO-Base, a 3.8B-parameter reference model trained exclusively on our public
data. It achieves a normalized score of 0.72, establishing a strong,
reproducible baseline that surpasses comparable models. Our analysis reveals
that while broader training coverage enhances performance, significant
generalization gaps persist on unseen tasks, particularly in pure audio
scenarios. By releasing the complete stack of data, benchmarks, and models,
LLaSO establishes a foundational open standard to unify research efforts and
accelerate community-driven progress in LSLMs. We release the code, dataset,
pretrained models, and results in https://github.com/EIT-NLP/LLaSO.

TL;DR: Fin-PRM是一个专门针对金融领域设计的流程奖励模型，通过整合步骤级和轨迹级奖励监督，在金融推理任务中显著优于通用PRMs和领域基线模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的流程奖励模型主要针对通用或STEM领域，在金融等专业领域中表现不足，因为金融推理需要更结构化、符号化且对事实和监管正确性敏感

Method: 开发了Fin-PRM模型，整合步骤级和轨迹级奖励监督，支持离线/在线奖励学习，应用于监督微调、强化学习和测试时推理三个关键场景

Result: 在CFLUE和FinQA金融推理基准测试中，Fin-PRM在轨迹选择质量上持续优于基线模型，下游模型性能提升显著：监督学习12.9%、强化学习5.2%、测试时性能5.1%

Conclusion: 领域专业化的奖励建模对于使大语言模型与专家级金融推理对齐具有重要价值，Fin-PRM为金融领域的推理监督提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have emerged as a promising framework for
supervising intermediate reasoning in large language models (LLMs), yet
existing PRMs are primarily trained on general or Science, Technology,
Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) domains and fall short in domain-specific
contexts such as finance, where reasoning is more structured, symbolic, and
sensitive to factual and regulatory correctness. We introduce \textbf{Fin-PRM},
a domain-specialized, trajectory-aware PRM tailored to evaluate intermediate
reasoning steps in financial tasks. Fin-PRM integrates step-level and
trajectory-level reward supervision, enabling fine-grained evaluation of
reasoning traces aligned with financial logic. We apply Fin-PRM in both offline
and online reward learning settings, supporting three key applications: (i)
selecting high-quality reasoning trajectories for distillation-based supervised
fine-tuning, (ii) providing dense process-level rewards for reinforcement
learning, and (iii) guiding reward-informed Best-of-N inference at test time.
Experimental results on financial reasoning benchmarks, including CFLUE and
FinQA, demonstrate that Fin-PRM consistently outperforms general-purpose PRMs
and strong domain baselines in trajectory selection quality. Downstream models
trained with Fin-PRM yield substantial improvements with baselines, with gains
of 12.9\% in supervised learning, 5.2\% in reinforcement learning, and 5.1\% in
test-time performance. These findings highlight the value of domain-specialized
reward modeling for aligning LLMs with expert-level financial reasoning. Our
project resources will be available at https://github.com/aliyun/qwen-dianjin.

TL;DR: SPARK是一种无需训练、即插即用的KV缓存压缩方法，通过在通道级别应用非结构化稀疏性来减少内存使用，同时保持模型精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KV缓存压缩方法主要沿时间轴进行压缩，忽略了特征维度（通道轴）上的细粒度重要性变化，限制了效率与精度的平衡能力。

Method: 提出SPARK方法，在通道级别对KV进行剪枝，并在注意力分数计算过程中动态恢复被剪枝的条目，与现有KV压缩和量化技术正交兼容。

Result: SPARK在相同内存预算下可处理更长序列，同等序列长度下KV缓存存储减少30%以上，即使在80%的激进剪枝比例下性能下降也小于5%。

Abstract: Long-context inference in large language models (LLMs) is increasingly
constrained by the KV cache bottleneck: memory usage grows linearly with
sequence length, while attention computation scales quadratically. Existing
approaches address this issue by compressing the KV cache along the temporal
axis through strategies such as token eviction or merging to reduce memory and
computational overhead. However, these methods often neglect fine-grained
importance variations across feature dimensions (i.e., the channel axis),
thereby limiting their ability to effectively balance efficiency and model
accuracy. In reality, we observe that channel saliency varies dramatically
across both queries and positions: certain feature channels carry near-zero
information for a given query, while others spike in relevance. To address this
oversight, we propose SPARK, a training-free plug-and-play method that applies
unstructured sparsity by pruning KV at the channel level, while dynamically
restoring the pruned entries during attention score computation. Notably, our
approach is orthogonal to existing KV compression and quantization techniques,
making it compatible for integration with them to achieve further acceleration.
By reducing channel-level redundancy, SPARK enables processing of longer
sequences within the same memory budget. For sequences of equal length, SPARK
not only preserves or improves model accuracy but also reduces KV cache storage
by over 30% compared to eviction-based methods. Furthermore, even with an
aggressive pruning ratio of 80%, SPARK maintains performance with less
degradation than 5% compared to the baseline eviction method, demonstrating its
robustness and effectiveness. Our code will be available at

*Bolei He,Xinran He,Run Shao,Shanfu Shu,Xianwei Xue,Mingquan Cheng,Haifeng Li,Zhenhua Ling*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Selct2Know (S2K) 框架通过内部-外部知识自选择策略和选择性监督微调，以低成本方式内化领域知识，在医学、法律和金融QA基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在领域特定场景中表现不佳，RAG存在幻觉和延迟问题，持续预训练成本高且缺乏跨域灵活性。领域知识的长尾分布导致部分有用内部知识未被充分利用。

Method: 提出S2K框架，采用内部-外部知识自选择策略和选择性监督微调，引入结构化推理数据生成管道并集成GRPO来增强推理能力。

Result: 在医学、法律和金融QA基准测试中，S2K持续优于现有方法，并以显著更低的成本达到领域预训练LLMs的性能水平。

Conclusion: S2K提供了一种成本效益高的解决方案，通过渐进式知识获取策略有效解决了领域特定知识获取的挑战，实现了与昂贵预训练方法相当的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in general QA but often struggle in
domain-specific scenarios. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) introduces
external knowledge but suffers from hallucinations and latency due to noisy
retrievals. Continued pretraining internalizes domain knowledge but is costly
and lacks cross-domain flexibility. We attribute this challenge to the
long-tail distribution of domain knowledge, which leaves partial yet useful
internal knowledge underutilized. We further argue that knowledge acquisition
should be progressive, mirroring human learning: first understanding concepts,
then applying them to complex reasoning. To address this, we propose Selct2Know
(S2K), a cost-effective framework that internalizes domain knowledge through an
internal-external knowledge self-selection strategy and selective supervised
fine-tuning. We also introduce a structured reasoning data generation pipeline
and integrate GRPO to enhance reasoning ability. Experiments on medical, legal,
and financial QA benchmarks show that S2K consistently outperforms existing
methods and matches domain-pretrained LLMs with significantly lower cost.

TL;DR: SEER是一种自引导方法，通过细粒度逐步检索持续更新的经验池，解决LLM在多步骤工具调用中的工具选择、参数生成和工具链规划问题，无需手动设计演示或检索静态库。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖手动设计任务特定演示或从精选库中检索，需要大量专家努力，随着工具多样性和任务难度增加，提示工程变得复杂低效。

Method: Stepwise Experience Recall (SEER)方法，从持续更新的经验池中进行细粒度逐步检索，增量式地用过去成功的轨迹扩充经验池。

Result: 在ToolQA基准测试中，SEER在简单问题上平均提升6.1%，困难问题上提升4.7%。在τ-bench真实场景中，使用Qwen2.5-7B和Qwen2.5-72B模型分别获得7.44%和23.38%的准确率提升。

Conclusion: SEER通过自引导的经验检索方法有效解决了LLM在多步骤工具调用中的挑战，实现了持续的性能改进，无需依赖静态或手动策划的库。

Abstract: Function calling enables large language models (LLMs) to interact with
external systems by leveraging tools and APIs. When faced with multi-step tool
usage, LLMs still struggle with tool selection, parameter generation, and
tool-chain planning. Existing methods typically rely on manually designing
task-specific demonstrations, or retrieving from a curated library. These
approaches demand substantial expert effort and prompt engineering becomes
increasingly complex and inefficient as tool diversity and task difficulty
scale. To address these challenges, we propose a self-guided method, Stepwise
Experience Recall (SEER), which performs fine-grained, stepwise retrieval from
a continually updated experience pool. Instead of relying on static or manually
curated library, SEER incrementally augments the experience pool with past
successful trajectories, enabling continuous expansion of the pool and improved
model performance over time. Evaluated on the ToolQA benchmark, SEER achieves
an average improvement of 6.1\% on easy and 4.7\% on hard questions. We further
test SEER on $\tau$-bench, which includes two real-world domains. Powered by
Qwen2.5-7B and Qwen2.5-72B models, SEER demonstrates substantial accuracy gains
of 7.44\% and 23.38\%, respectively.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了自动检查表在生成任务评估中的有效性，发现选择性使用检查表在成对比较中能提升性能，但在直接评分中效果不一致。检查表项目即使与人工评分相关性低，也常反映人工评估标准，揭示了人工评估的不一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在生成任务自动评估中面临标准模糊的挑战，自动检查表生成虽然是有前景的方法，但其有效性尚未充分探索。需要明确检查表应该普遍使用还是选择性使用，以及如何生成有效的检查表。

Method: 使用六种方法生成检查表，在八种不同规模的模型上进行实验，评估检查表在成对比较和直接评分任务中的有效性，并识别与人工评估相关的检查表项目。

Result: 选择性使用检查表在成对比较设置中倾向于提高评估性能，但在直接评分中的益处不太一致。即使与人工评分相关性低的检查表项目也经常反映人工编写的标准，表明人工评估存在潜在的不一致性。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了需要更清晰地定义客观评估标准，以指导人工和自动评估。自动检查表可以作为有价值的工具，但需要谨慎使用和进一步优化。

Abstract: Automatic evaluation of generative tasks using large language models faces
challenges due to ambiguous criteria. Although automatic checklist generation
is a potentially promising approach, its usefulness remains underexplored. We
investigate whether checklists should be used for all questions or selectively,
generate them using six methods, evaluate their effectiveness across eight
model sizes, and identify checklist items that correlate with human
evaluations. Through experiments on pairwise comparison and direct scoring
tasks, we find that selective checklist use tends to improve evaluation
performance in pairwise settings, while its benefits are less consistent in
direct scoring. Our analysis also shows that even checklist items with low
correlation to human scores often reflect human-written criteria, indicating
potential inconsistencies in human evaluation. These findings highlight the
need to more clearly define objective evaluation criteria to guide both human
and automatic evaluations. \footnote{Our code is available

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VocabTailor是一个解耦的动态词汇选择框架，通过卸载嵌入和混合静态-动态词汇选择策略，显著减少SLM词汇相关组件内存使用达99%，性能损失最小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小型语言模型在边缘设备部署时面临内存瓶颈，主要来自词汇相关组件（嵌入和语言建模头）的大词汇量。现有静态词汇剪枝方法存在信息损失和灵活性不足的问题。

Method: 基于词汇局部性原理和计算不对称性，提出VocabTailor框架：1）通过卸载嵌入减少内存；2）为LM头设计混合静态-动态词汇选择策略，实现按需加载词汇组件。

Result: 在多样化下游任务中，VocabTailor将词汇相关组件内存使用减少高达99%，任务性能仅有最小或没有下降，显著优于现有静态词汇剪枝方法。

Conclusion: VocabTailor通过动态词汇选择有效解决了SLM在边缘设备部署中的内存瓶颈问题，在保持性能的同时大幅降低内存占用，为资源受限环境中的模型部署提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) provide computational advantages in
resource-constrained environments, yet memory limitations remain a critical
bottleneck for edge device deployment. A substantial portion of SLMs' memory
footprint stems from vocabulary-related components, particularly embeddings and
language modeling (LM) heads, due to large vocabulary sizes. Existing static
vocabulary pruning, while reducing memory usage, suffers from rigid,
one-size-fits-all designs that cause information loss from the prefill stage
and a lack of flexibility. In this work, we identify two key principles
underlying the vocabulary reduction challenge: the lexical locality principle,
the observation that only a small subset of tokens is required during any
single inference, and the asymmetry in computational characteristics between
vocabulary-related components of SLM. Based on these insights, we introduce
VocabTailor, a novel decoupled dynamic vocabulary selection framework that
addresses memory constraints through offloading embedding and implements a
hybrid static-dynamic vocabulary selection strategy for LM Head, enabling
on-demand loading of vocabulary components. Comprehensive experiments across
diverse downstream tasks demonstrate that VocabTailor achieves a reduction of
up to 99% in the memory usage of vocabulary-related components with minimal or
no degradation in task performance, substantially outperforming existing static
vocabulary pruning.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了WangchanThaiInstruct数据集，一个人工编写的泰语指令调整数据集，用于解决大语言模型在泰语等低资源语言中的表现问题，并证明本土化指令数据在提升模型性能方面更有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型在英语指令跟随上表现优异，但在泰语等低资源语言中表现待探索。现有测试集多依赖翻译，缺乏文化和领域特定的细节，无法满足实际应用需求。

Method: 构建WangchanThaiInstruct数据集，包含四个专业领域和七种任务类型，通过注释员、领域专家和AI研究人员多阶段质量控制过程制作。进行两个研究：(1)零样本评估，显示在文化和专业特定任务上的性能差距；(2)指令调整研究，通过消融实验隔离本土监督的效果。

Result: 使用WangchanThaiInstruct进行微调的模型在领域内外测试中都显著超过使用翻译数据的模型。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了需要基于文化和专业知识的本土指令数据，以改善大语言模型在低资源、语言多样性环境中的对齐性能力。

Abstract: Large language models excel at instruction-following in English, but their
performance in low-resource languages like Thai remains underexplored. Existing
benchmarks often rely on translations, missing cultural and domain-specific
nuances needed for real-world use. We present WangchanThaiInstruct, a
human-authored Thai dataset for evaluation and instruction tuning, covering
four professional domains and seven task types. Created through a multi-stage
quality control process with annotators, domain experts, and AI researchers,
WangchanThaiInstruct supports two studies: (1) a zero-shot evaluation showing
performance gaps on culturally and professionally specific tasks, and (2) an
instruction tuning study with ablations isolating the effect of native
supervision. Models fine-tuned on WangchanThaiInstruct outperform those using
translated data in both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks. These findings
underscore the need for culturally and professionally grounded instruction data
to improve LLM alignment in low-resource, linguistically diverse settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型职业模拟缺乏全面的心理和伦理评估，特别是在教育领域需要确保AI教师的伦理和心理安全性。

Method: 构建了88个教师特定道德困境场景，扩展现有量表，使用针对性软提示注入集评估教师角色LLMs的合规性和脆弱性。

Result: 实验显示教师角色LLMs比人类教师表现出更理想化和极化的人格特征，在抽象道德推理方面表现优异，但在情感复杂情境中表现不佳。推理能力更强的模型更容易受到有害提示注入的影响。

Conclusion: 该研究首次建立了评估教师角色LLMs伦理和心理对齐的基准，揭示了模型能力与安全性之间的悖论，为教育AI的安全性评估提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Simulating Professions (SP) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to emulate
professional roles. However, comprehensive psychological and ethical evaluation
in these contexts remains lacking. This paper introduces EMNLP, an
Educator-role Moral and Normative LLMs Profiling framework for personality
profiling, moral development stage measurement, and ethical risk under soft
prompt injection. EMNLP extends existing scales and constructs 88
teacher-specific moral dilemmas, enabling profession-oriented comparison with
human teachers. A targeted soft prompt injection set evaluates compliance and
vulnerability in teacher SP. Experiments on 12 LLMs show teacher-role LLMs
exhibit more idealized and polarized personalities than human teachers, excel
in abstract moral reasoning, but struggle with emotionally complex situations.
Models with stronger reasoning are more vulnerable to harmful prompt injection,
revealing a paradox between capability and safety. The model temperature and
other hyperparameters have limited influence except in some risk behaviors.
This paper presents the first benchmark to assess ethical and psychological
alignment of teacher-role LLMs for educational AI. Resources are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当检索到的外部上下文与LLM的参数知识相矛盾时，现有RAG系统无法有效解决这种冲突，导致模型可能被错误的外部信息误导

Method: 提出CARE框架，包含上下文评估器和基础LLM。上下文评估器通过压缩记忆令牌嵌入和对抗性软提示训练，来识别不可靠上下文并生成指导信号

Result: 在QA和事实核查基准测试中平均性能提升5.0%，有效缓解了上下文-记忆冲突问题

Conclusion: CARE为构建可信赖和自适应的RAG系统提供了有前景的方向，能够更好地处理外部知识与内部知识之间的冲突

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances the capabilities of large
language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge into their input
prompts. However, when the retrieved context contradicts the LLM's parametric
knowledge, it often fails to resolve the conflict between incorrect external
context and correct parametric knowledge, known as context-memory conflict. To
tackle this problem, we introduce Conflict-Aware REtrieval-Augmented Generation
(CARE), consisting of a context assessor and a base LLM. The context assessor
encodes compact memory token embeddings from raw context tokens. Through
grounded/adversarial soft prompting, the context assessor is trained to discern
unreliable context and capture a guidance signal that directs reasoning toward
the more reliable knowledge source. Extensive experiments show that CARE
effectively mitigates context-memory conflicts, leading to an average
performance gain of 5.0\% on QA and fact-checking benchmarks, establishing a
promising direction for trustworthy and adaptive RAG systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用大语言模型自动挖掘时间常识的管道，构建了TComQA数据集，并在时间问答任务上取得了优于现有方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解事件需要掌握其时间上下文，但时间常识在自然语言中往往不会明确提及。即使先进的大语言模型也难以生成需要时间常识推理的文本，因此自动挖掘时间常识对于构建鲁棒的语言模型至关重要。

Method: 提出了一个时间常识提取管道，利用大语言模型从SAMSum和RealNews语料库中自动挖掘时间常识，构建TComQA数据集，并通过众包验证数据质量。

Result: 构建的TComQA数据集在时间常识提取方面达到超过80%的精确度。使用TComQA训练的模型在时间问答任务上优于基于现有数据集微调的大语言模型。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效自动挖掘时间常识，构建高质量数据集，并提升模型在时间相关任务上的性能，为解决时间常识推理问题提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Understanding events necessitates grasping their temporal context, which is
often not explicitly stated in natural language. For example, it is not a
trivial task for a machine to infer that a museum tour may last for a few
hours, but can not take months. Recent studies indicate that even advanced
large language models (LLMs) struggle in generating text that require reasoning
with temporal commonsense due to its infrequent explicit mention in text.
Therefore, automatically mining temporal commonsense for events enables the
creation of robust language models. In this work, we investigate the capacity
of LLMs to extract temporal commonsense from text and evaluate multiple
experimental setups to assess their effectiveness. Here, we propose a temporal
commonsense extraction pipeline that leverages LLMs to automatically mine
temporal commonsense and use it to construct TComQA, a dataset derived from
SAMSum and RealNews corpora. TComQA has been validated through crowdsourcing
and achieves over 80\% precision in extracting temporal commonsense. The model
trained with TComQA also outperforms an LLM fine-tuned on existing dataset of
temporal question answering task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多语音处理任务需要不受上下文影响的纯净音素表示，但现有方法通常需要分析长语音片段和语言特定模式。

Method: 开发CUPE模型，处理短固定宽度窗口（约一个音素长度），学习所有语言共有的基本声学模式，参数比现有方法更少。

Result: 在多种语言的监督和自监督训练中表现优异，包括UCLA语音语料库的零样本测试，展示了强大的跨语言泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过在音素长度窗口内建模基本声学模式，可以实现有效的通用语音处理。

Abstract: Universal phoneme recognition typically requires analyzing long speech
segments and language-specific patterns. Many speech processing tasks require
pure phoneme representations free from contextual influence, which motivated
our development of CUPE - a lightweight model that captures key phoneme
features in just 120 milliseconds, about one phoneme's length. CUPE processes
short, fixed-width windows independently and, despite fewer parameters than
current approaches, achieves competitive cross-lingual performance by learning
fundamental acoustic patterns common to all languages. Our extensive evaluation
through supervised and self-supervised training on diverse languages, including
zero-shot tests on the UCLA Phonetic Corpus, demonstrates strong cross-lingual
generalization and reveals that effective universal speech processing is
possible through modeling basic acoustic patterns within phoneme-length
windows.

Motivation: 知识图补全模型在不同数据集和不同评估指标上表现不一致，导致模型选择困难，需要一种统一的元评估指标来综合多重性能维度。

Method: 提出EDAS（Distance from Average Solution）元评估指标，通过计算模型性能与平均解的距离，将多个数据集和多种指标的表现综合为一个标准化分数（M_i ∈ [0,1]）。

Result: 在FB15k-237和WN18RR等标准数据集上的实验结果显示，EDAS能够有效统一多重指标和多数据集的性能排名，提供了一致、稳健且可推广的评估框架。

Conclusion: EDAS作为一种新的元评估指标，能够解决知识图补全模型评估中的不一致性问题，为模型选择提供更可靠的全局视角，促进跨数据集评估的公平性。

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) enable applications in various domains such as
semantic search, recommendation systems, and natural language processing. KGs
are often incomplete, missing entities and relations, an issue addressed by
Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) methods that predict missing elements.
Different evaluation metrics, such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), Mean Rank
(MR), and Hit@k, are commonly used to assess the performance of such KGC
models. A major challenge in evaluating KGC models, however, lies in comparing
their performance across multiple datasets and metrics. A model may outperform
others on one dataset but underperform on another, making it difficult to
determine overall superiority. Moreover, even within a single dataset,
different metrics such as MRR and Hit@1 can yield conflicting rankings, where
one model excels in MRR while another performs better in Hit@1, further
complicating model selection for downstream tasks. These inconsistencies hinder
holistic comparisons and highlight the need for a unified meta-metric that
integrates performance across all metrics and datasets to enable a more
reliable and interpretable evaluation framework. To address this need, we
propose KG Evaluation based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS), a robust
and interpretable meta-metric that synthesizes model performance across
multiple datasets and diverse evaluation criteria into a single normalized
score ($M_i \in [0,1]$). Unlike traditional metrics that focus on isolated
aspects of performance, EDAS offers a global perspective that supports more
informed model selection and promotes fairness in cross-dataset evaluation.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets such as FB15k-237 and WN18RR
demonstrate that EDAS effectively integrates multi-metric, multi-dataset
performance into a unified ranking, offering a consistent, robust, and
generalizable framework for evaluating KGC models.

Conclusion: 为未来基准创新提供了可参考的设计范式，强调需要解决现有基准的局限性以更好地评估和指导大语言模型的发展。

Abstract: In recent years, with the rapid development of the depth and breadth of large
language models' capabilities, various corresponding evaluation benchmarks have
been emerging in increasing numbers. As a quantitative assessment tool for
model performance, benchmarks are not only a core means to measure model
capabilities but also a key element in guiding the direction of model
development and promoting technological innovation. We systematically review
the current status and development of large language model benchmarks for the
first time, categorizing 283 representative benchmarks into three categories:
general capabilities, domain-specific, and target-specific. General capability
benchmarks cover aspects such as core linguistics, knowledge, and reasoning;
domain-specific benchmarks focus on fields like natural sciences, humanities
and social sciences, and engineering technology; target-specific benchmarks pay
attention to risks, reliability, agents, etc. We point out that current
benchmarks have problems such as inflated scores caused by data contamination,
unfair evaluation due to cultural and linguistic biases, and lack of evaluation
on process credibility and dynamic environments, and provide a referable design
paradigm for future benchmark innovation.

Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型的可信度评估方法往往关注狭窄方面，忽视了多模态引入的风险，需要全面的评估基准来系统性地解决这些问题。

Method: 提出了MultiTrust-X基准，定义了三维度框架（5个可信度方面、2个风险类型、多种缓解策略），包含32个任务和28个数据集，评估了30多个开源和专有模型，并分析了8种缓解方法。

Result: 实验发现当前模型存在显著漏洞，可信度与通用能力之间存在差距，多模态训练和推理会放大基础LLM的潜在风险。现有缓解策略大多只能改善特定方面，很少能有效解决整体可信度问题，且会带来意外的权衡。

Conclusion: 提出了推理增强的安全对齐方法RESA，通过赋予模型思维链推理能力来发现潜在风险，取得了最先进的结果，为未来改进提供了实用见解。

Abstract: The trustworthiness of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) remains an
intense concern despite the significant progress in their capabilities.
Existing evaluation and mitigation approaches often focus on narrow aspects and
overlook risks introduced by the multimodality. To tackle these challenges, we
propose MultiTrust-X, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating, analyzing, and
mitigating the trustworthiness issues of MLLMs. We define a three-dimensional
framework, encompassing five trustworthiness aspects which include
truthfulness, robustness, safety, fairness, and privacy; two novel risk types
covering multimodal risks and cross-modal impacts; and various mitigation
strategies from the perspectives of data, model architecture, training, and
inference algorithms. Based on the taxonomy, MultiTrust-X includes 32 tasks and
28 curated datasets, enabling holistic evaluations over 30 open-source and
proprietary MLLMs and in-depth analysis with 8 representative mitigation
methods. Our extensive experiments reveal significant vulnerabilities in
current models, including a gap between trustworthiness and general
capabilities, as well as the amplification of potential risks in base LLMs by
both multimodal training and inference. Moreover, our controlled analysis
uncovers key limitations in existing mitigation strategies that, while some
methods yield improvements in specific aspects, few effectively address overall
trustworthiness, and many introduce unexpected trade-offs that compromise model
utility. These findings also provide practical insights for future
improvements, such as the benefits of reasoning to better balance safety and
performance. Based on these insights, we introduce a Reasoning-Enhanced Safety
Alignment (RESA) approach that equips the model with chain-of-thought reasoning
ability to discover the underlying risks, achieving state-of-the-art results.

TL;DR: 提出基于信息论的置信度调制推测解码框架，通过熵和边际不确定性动态调整推测生成长度，提高解码效率并保持输出质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推测解码方法使用静态生成长度和固定验证标准，无法适应不同模型不确定性和输入复杂度，限制了方法的适应性和效率

Method: 利用drafter输出分布的熵和边际不确定性度量，动态调整每轮推测生成的token数量，并使用相同置信度信号调制验证过程

Result: 在机器翻译和摘要任务上相比标准推测解码显著加速，同时保持或改进了BLEU和ROUGE分数

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个原则性的即插即用方法，可在不同不确定性条件下实现大型语言模型的高效鲁棒解码

Abstract: Speculative decoding has emerged as an effective approach for accelerating
autoregressive inference by parallelizing token generation through a
draft-then-verify paradigm. However, existing methods rely on static drafting
lengths and rigid verification criteria, limiting their adaptability across
varying model uncertainties and input complexities. This paper proposes an
information-theoretic framework for speculative decoding based on
confidence-modulated drafting. By leveraging entropy and margin-based
uncertainty measures over the drafter's output distribution, the proposed
method dynamically adjusts the number of speculatively generated tokens at each
iteration. This adaptive mechanism reduces rollback frequency, improves
resource utilization, and maintains output fidelity. Additionally, the
verification process is modulated using the same confidence signals, enabling
more flexible acceptance of drafted tokens without sacrificing generation
quality. Experiments on machine translation and summarization tasks demonstrate
significant speedups over standard speculative decoding while preserving or
improving BLEU and ROUGE scores. The proposed approach offers a principled,
plug-in method for efficient and robust decoding in large language models under

### [68] [Exploiting Vocabulary Frequency Imbalance in Language Model Pre-training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15390)
*Woojin Chung,Jeonghoon Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究表明，更大的词汇表通过降低token化文本的复杂度来提升语言模型性能，主要受益于高频词汇的不确定性降低，而非改善罕见词处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大型词汇表对语言模型性能提升的真正原因，因为当前实践倾向于使用越来越大的词汇表，但其益处来源尚不明确。

Method: 进行控制实验，将词汇表从24K扩展到196K，同时保持数据、计算和优化不变。使用Kolmogorov复杂度量化token化文本复杂度，并进行词级损失分解分析。

Result: 更大的词汇表主要通过降低前2500个高频词的不确定性来减少交叉熵，尽管罕见词的损失反而增加。约束嵌入范数会逆转这种增益，表明模型利用了而非受制于token频率不平衡。

Conclusion: 词汇表大小的益处应重新理解为"降低token化文本复杂度有助于模型性能"，这为tokenizer-模型协同设计提供了简单而有原则的杠杆，并阐明了预训练中语言模型扩展的损失动态。

Abstract: Large language models are trained with tokenizers, and the resulting token
distribution is highly imbalanced: a few words dominate the stream while most
occur rarely. Recent practice favors ever-larger vocabularies, but the source
of the benefit is unclear. We conduct a controlled study that scales the
language model's vocabulary from 24K to 196K while holding data, compute, and
optimization fixed. We first quantify the complexity of tokenized text,
formalized via Kolmogorov complexity, and show that larger vocabularies reduce
this complexity. Above 24K, every common word is already a single token, so
further growth mainly deepens the relative token-frequency imbalance. A
word-level loss decomposition shows that larger vocabularies reduce
cross-entropy almost exclusively by lowering uncertainty on the 2,500 most
frequent words, even though loss on the rare tail rises. Constraining input and
output embedding norms to attenuate the effect of token-frequency imbalance
reverses the gain, directly showing that the model exploits rather than suffers
from imbalance. Because the same frequent words cover roughly 77% of tokens in
downstream benchmarks, this training advantage transfers intact. We also show
that enlarging model parameters with a fixed vocabulary yields the same
frequent-word benefit. Our results reframe "bigger vocabularies help" as
"lowering the complexity of tokenized text helps," providing a simple,
principled lever for tokenizer-model co-design and clarifying the loss dynamics
that govern language-model scaling in pre-training.

Conclusion: 该研究为基于证据的文本生成领域提供了系统性的分析框架，指出了开放挑战并为未来工作指明了有前景的方向。

Abstract: The increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs) has been accompanied
by growing concerns regarding their reliability and trustworthiness. As a
result, a growing body of research focuses on evidence-based text generation
with LLMs, aiming to link model outputs to supporting evidence to ensure
traceability and verifiability. However, the field is fragmented due to
inconsistent terminology, isolated evaluation practices, and a lack of unified
benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we systematically analyze 134 papers, introduce
a unified taxonomy of evidence-based text generation with LLMs, and investigate
300 evaluation metrics across seven key dimensions. Thereby, we focus on
approaches that use citations, attribution, or quotations for evidence-based
text generation. Building on this, we examine the distinctive characteristics
and representative methods in the field. Finally, we highlight open challenges
and outline promising directions for future work.

### [70] [When Audio and Text Disagree: Revealing Text Bias in Large Audio-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15407)
*Cheng Wang,Gelei Deng,Xianglin Yang,Han Qiu,Tianwei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了MCR-BENCH基准测试，发现大型音频-语言模型在处理音频-文本冲突信息时存在明显的文本偏向性，经常忽视音频证据，导致音频中心任务性能显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型音频-语言模型虽然具备音频感知能力，但在处理音频和文本模态间冲突信息时的表现尚未得到充分研究，需要系统评估其信息优先级的处理能力。

Method: 开发了首个专门评估音频-文本不一致对处理能力的综合基准MCR-BENCH，通过广泛的音频理解任务评估，分析模型偏向性，并探索监督微调等缓解策略。

Result: 研究发现LALMs存在显著的文本偏向性，在模态冲突时经常忽视音频证据，导致音频任务性能大幅下降，即使面对矛盾输入也表现出持续的过度自信。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在训练中改进模态平衡和开发更复杂融合机制的必要性，以增强处理冲突多模态输入时的鲁棒性和可靠性。

Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) are enhanced with audio perception
capabilities, enabling them to effectively process and understand multimodal
inputs that combine audio and text. However, their performance in handling
conflicting information between audio and text modalities remains largely
unexamined. This paper introduces MCR-BENCH, the first comprehensive benchmark
specifically designed to evaluate how LALMs prioritize information when
presented with inconsistent audio-text pairs. Through extensive evaluation
across diverse audio understanding tasks, we reveal a concerning phenomenon:
when inconsistencies exist between modalities, LALMs display a significant bias
toward textual input, frequently disregarding audio evidence. This tendency
leads to substantial performance degradation in audio-centric tasks and raises
important reliability concerns for real-world applications. We further
investigate the influencing factors of text bias, and explore mitigation
strategies through supervised finetuning, and analyze model confidence patterns
that reveal persistent overconfidence even with contradictory inputs. These
findings underscore the need for improved modality balance during training and
more sophisticated fusion mechanisms to enhance the robustness when handling
conflicting multi-modal inputs. The project is available at

Motivation: 因为不同语言在食物、服装、文化和传统等领域存在许多无对应词汇，这些词汇在目标语言中缺乏直接对应词，导致理解困难和误解，需要专业的翻译方法来处理。

Method: 采用图书馆研究方法（library-based research），通过系统性的文献调研来探讨和形成非对应词汇的翻译方法与规则。

Result: 研究提出了多种从源语言向目标语言翻译非对应词汇的方法和规则，并成功将达尔属语和乌兹别克语中的25个非对应词汇翻译成了英语和俄语。

Conclusion: 该研究为处理语言之间的非对应词汇提供了专业的翻译方法与规则，有助于减少语言理解上的障碍和误解，对于语言学家和翻译人员具有重要的实践价值。

Abstract: These pure languages understanding directly relates to translation knowledge
where linguists and translators need to work and research to eradicate
misunderstanding. Misunderstandings mostly appear in non-equivalent words
because there are different local and internal words like food, garment,
cultural and traditional words and others in every notion. Truly, most of these
words do not have equivalent in the target language and these words need to be
worked and find their equivalent in the target language to fully understand the
both languages. The purpose of this research is to introduce the methods of
rendering non-equivalent words professionally from the source language to the
target language and this research has been completed using library-based
research. However, some of these non-equivalent words are already
professionally rendered to the target language but still there many other words
to be rendered. As a result, this research paper includes different ways and
rules of rendering non-equivalent words from source language to the target
language and 25 non-equvalent words have been rendered from Dar & Uzbek into
English and Russian languages.

Motivation: 现有的可编程任务导向对话代理的有效性依赖于准确的对话状态跟踪，但传统方法存在局限性。

Method: 采用简单的约束解码方法，使用语言模型而非语法规则来遵循API模式，生成可执行代码进行状态跟踪，并利用策略和执行反馈进行错误纠正。

Result: 在具有挑战性的SGD基准测试中实现了最先进的对话状态跟踪性能，在准确性和鲁棒性用户目标估计方面均超越了强基线模型。

Conclusion: 执行感知的状态跟踪方法在任务导向对话系统中表现出显著的有效性，PyTOD为对话状态跟踪提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Programmable task-oriented dialogue (TOD) agents enable language models to
follow structured dialogue policies, but their effectiveness hinges on accurate
state tracking. We present PyTOD, an agent that generates executable code to
track dialogue state and uses policy and execution feedback for efficient error
correction. To this end, PyTOD employs a simple constrained decoding approach,
using a language model instead of grammar rules to follow API schemata. This
leads to state-of-the-art state tracking performance on the challenging SGD
benchmark. Our experiments show that PyTOD surpasses strong baselines in both
accuracy and robust user goal estimation as the dialogue progresses,
demonstrating the effectiveness of execution-aware state tracking.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RadReason是一个新的放射学报告评估框架，提供细粒度错误类型评分和可解释的评分理由，超越了现有方法并达到与GPT-4相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有放射学报告自动评估方法要么提供粗粒度整体评分，要么依赖不透明的黑盒模型，缺乏临床可解释性和细粒度分析能力，限制了在真实临床工作中的应用。

Method: 基于Group Relative Policy Optimization构建，引入两个关键创新：1) Sub-score Dynamic Weighting根据实时F1统计自适应调整临床挑战性错误类型的权重；2) Majority-Guided Advantage Scaling基于子评分一致性调整策略梯度更新。

Result: 在ReXVal基准测试中，RadReason超越了所有现有离线评估指标，达到与GPT-4评估相当的性能，同时保持可解释性、成本效益和临床部署适用性。

Conclusion: RadReason提供了一个临床可解释、细粒度且高效的放射学报告评估框架，解决了现有方法的局限性，具有重要的临床应用价值。

Abstract: Evaluating automatically generated radiology reports remains a fundamental
challenge due to the lack of clinically grounded, interpretable, and
fine-grained metrics. Existing methods either produce coarse overall scores or
rely on opaque black-box models, limiting their usefulness in real-world
clinical workflows. We introduce RadReason, a novel evaluation framework for
radiology reports that not only outputs fine-grained sub-scores across six
clinically defined error types, but also produces human-readable justifications
that explain the rationale behind each score. Our method builds on Group
Relative Policy Optimization and incorporates two key innovations: (1)
Sub-score Dynamic Weighting, which adaptively prioritizes clinically
challenging error types based on live F1 statistics; and (2) Majority-Guided
Advantage Scaling, which adjusts policy gradient updates based on prompt
difficulty derived from sub-score agreement. Together, these components enable
more stable optimization and better alignment with expert clinical judgment.
Experiments on the ReXVal benchmark show that RadReason surpasses all prior
offline metrics and achieves parity with GPT-4-based evaluations, while
remaining explainable, cost-efficient, and suitable for clinical deployment.
Code will be released upon publication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个性化营销能显著提升客户参与度和业务增长，研究表明良好的个性化策略可使收入提升达40%，但现有研究主要集中在推荐系统和个性化广告，个性化优惠生成领域仍有巨大潜力。

Method: 使用对比学习方法微调Google的T5-Small编码器-解码器语言模型，采用InfoNCE损失函数在共享嵌入空间中对齐客户画像和相关优惠，通过自适应学习行为重塑潜在空间增强模型泛化能力。

Result: 在模拟客户行为和优惠接受模式的合成数据集上评估，实验结果显示相比监督微调基线，优惠接受率提高了17%。

Conclusion: 对比学习目标在推进个性化营销方面非常有效，SLM4Offer模型通过创新的对比学习方法显著提升了个性化优惠生成的效果。

Abstract: Personalized marketing has emerged as a pivotal strategy for enhancing
customer engagement and driving business growth. Academic and industry efforts
have predominantly focused on recommendation systems and personalized
advertisements. Nonetheless, this facet of personalization holds significant
potential for increasing conversion rates and improving customer satisfaction.
Prior studies suggest that well-executed personalization strategies can boost
revenue by up to 40 percent, underscoring the strategic importance of
developing intelligent, data-driven approaches for offer generation. This work
introduces SLM4Offer, a generative AI model for personalized offer generation,
developed by fine-tuning a pre-trained encoder-decoder language model,
specifically Google's Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5-Small 60M) using a
contrastive learning approach. SLM4Offer employs InfoNCE (Information
Noise-Contrastive Estimation) loss to align customer personas with relevant
offers in a shared embedding space. A key innovation in SLM4Offer lies in the
adaptive learning behaviour introduced by contrastive loss, which reshapes the
latent space during training and enhances the model's generalizability. The
model is fine-tuned and evaluated on a synthetic dataset designed to simulate
customer behaviour and offer acceptance patterns. Experimental results
demonstrate a 17 percent improvement in offer acceptance rate over a supervised
fine-tuning baseline, highlighting the effectiveness of contrastive objectives
in advancing personalized marketing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 质疑大型语言模型是否能够充分捐摆不同用户的主观行为和偏好，并探索如何更好地表征用户浏览行为构成的"浏览语言"。

Method: 提出HeTLM方法，通过聚类特定的参数集来模拟异质性用户行为，使用页面级别的tokenizer训练小型语言模型。

Result: 小型LM在浏览语言表征上超过大型预训练或微调LM；HeTLM模型在控制参数数量的情况下超过单一LM；实现了更高的性能平均值和更低的方差。

Conclusion: 聚类训练语言模型能够更好地处理主观性行为，提高用户级别的对齐效果，为异质性用户行为模拟提供了有效方案。

Abstract: A Large Language Model (LLM) offers versatility across domains and tasks,
purportedly benefiting users with a wide variety of behaviors and preferences.
We question this perception about an LLM when users have inherently subjective
behaviors and preferences, as seen in their ubiquitous and idiosyncratic
browsing of websites or apps. The sequential behavior logs of pages, thus
generated, form something akin to each user's self-constructed "language",
albeit without the structure and grammar imbued in natural languages. We ask:
(i) Can a small LM represent the "language of browsing" better than a large LM?
(ii) Can an LM with a single set of parameters (or, single LM) adequately
capture myriad users' heterogeneous, subjective behaviors and preferences?
(iii) Can a single LM with high average performance, yield low variance in
performance to make alignment good at user level? We introduce clusterwise LM
training, HeTLM (Heterogeneity aware Training of Language Model), appropriate
for subjective behaviors. We find that (i) a small LM trained using a
page-level tokenizer outperforms large pretrained or finetuned LMs; (ii) HeTLM
with heterogeneous cluster specific set of parameters outperforms a single LM
of the same family, controlling for the number of parameters; and (iii) a
higher mean and a lower variance in generation ensues, implying improved
alignment.

TL;DR: 本研究提出使用训练数据影响力作为模型中心难度指标来改进课程学习，相比传统人工难度指标，在语言模型预训练中取得了显著提升，性能提升超过10个百分点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统课程学习在语言模型预训练中效果有限，因为人工定义的难度指标可能无法准确反映模型训练过程中的实际难度。

Method: 使用训练数据影响力作为难度指标对训练样本进行排序，该指标估计单个训练样本对模型输出的影响程度。

Result: 采用模型中心难度指标的课程学习方法在基准测试中比随机顺序训练的性能提升超过10个百分点。

Conclusion: 课程学习对语言模型预训练是有益的，但需要采用更符合模型训练特性的模型中心难度概念。

Abstract: Curriculum learning, a training technique where data is presented to the
model in order of example difficulty (e.g., from simpler to more complex
documents), has shown limited success for pre-training language models. In this
work, we investigate whether curriculum learning becomes competitive if we
replace conventional human-centered difficulty metrics with one that more
closely corresponds to example difficulty as observed during model training.
Specifically, we experiment with sorting training examples by their
\textit{training data influence}, a score which estimates the effect of
individual training examples on the model's output. Models trained on our
curricula are able to outperform ones trained in random order by over 10
percentage points in benchmarks, confirming that curriculum learning is
beneficial for language model pre-training, as long as a more model-centric
notion of difficulty is adopted.

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) offer computational efficiency and
accessibility, yet a systematic evaluation of their performance and
environmental impact remains lacking. We introduce SLM-Bench, the first
benchmark specifically designed to assess SLMs across multiple dimensions,
including accuracy, computational efficiency, and sustainability metrics.
SLM-Bench evaluates 15 SLMs on 9 NLP tasks using 23 datasets spanning 14
domains. The evaluation is conducted on 4 hardware configurations, providing a
rigorous comparison of their effectiveness. Unlike prior benchmarks, SLM-Bench
quantifies 11 metrics across correctness, computation, and consumption,
enabling a holistic assessment of efficiency trade-offs. Our evaluation
considers controlled hardware conditions, ensuring fair comparisons across
models. We develop an open-source benchmarking pipeline with standardized
evaluation protocols to facilitate reproducibility and further research. Our
findings highlight the diverse trade-offs among SLMs, where some models excel
in accuracy while others achieve superior energy efficiency. SLM-Bench sets a
new standard for SLM evaluation, bridging the gap between resource efficiency
and real-world applicability.

Abstract: Political language is deeply intertwined with social identities. While social
identities are often shaped by specific cultural contexts and expressed through
particular uses of language, existing datasets for group and identity detection
are predominantly English-centric, single-label and focus on coarse identity
categories. We introduce HebID, the first multilabel Hebrew corpus for social
identity detection: 5,536 sentences from Israeli politicians' Facebook posts
(Dec 2018-Apr 2021), manually annotated for twelve nuanced social identities
(e.g. Rightist, Ultra-Orthodox, Socially-oriented) grounded by survey data. We
benchmark multilabel and single-label encoders alongside 2B-9B-parameter
generative LLMs, finding that Hebrew-tuned LLMs provide the best results
(macro-$F_1$ = 0.74). We apply our classifier to politicians' Facebook posts
and parliamentary speeches, evaluating differences in popularity, temporal
trends, clustering patterns, and gender-related variations in identity
expression. We utilize identity choices from a national public survey, enabling
a comparison between identities portrayed in elite discourse and the public's
identity priorities. HebID provides a comprehensive foundation for studying
social identities in Hebrew and can serve as a model for similar research in
other non-English political contexts.

Abstract: We introduce Dream 7B, the most powerful open diffusion large language model
to date. Unlike autoregressive (AR) models that generate tokens sequentially,
Dream 7B employs discrete diffusion modeling to refine sequences in parallel
through iterative denoising. Our model consistently outperforms existing
diffusion language models on general, mathematical, and coding tasks. Dream 7B
demonstrates superior planning abilities and inference flexibility, including
arbitrary-order generation, infilling capabilities, and tunable quality-speed
trade-offs. These results are achieved through simple yet effective training
techniques, including AR-based LLM initialization and context-adaptive
token-level noise rescheduling. We release both Dream-Base and Dream-Instruct
to facilitate further research in diffusion-based language modeling.

validity of political entities. We curate and manually annotate a novel
Hebrew-language corpus of 10,410 sentences drawn from Knesset speeches
(1993-2023), Facebook posts (2018-2021), and leading news outlets, of which
1,812 instances (17.4\%) exhibit PDD and 642 carry additional annotations for
intensity, incivility, target type, and affective framing. We introduce a
two-stage classification pipeline combining finetuned encoder models and
decoder LLMs. Our best model (DictaLM 2.0) attains an F$_1$ of 0.74 for binary
PDD detection and a macro-F$_1$ of 0.67 for classification of delegitimization
characteristics. Applying this classifier to longitudinal and cross-platform
data, we see a marked rise in PDD over three decades, higher prevalence on
social media versus parliamentary debate, greater use by male than female
politicians, and stronger tendencies among right-leaning actors - with
pronounced spikes during election campaigns and major political events. Our
findings demonstrate the feasibility and value of automated PDD analysis for
understanding democratic discourse.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has intensified the
requirement for reliable safety evaluation to uncover model vulnerabilities. To
this end, numerous LLM safety evaluation benchmarks are proposed. However,
existing benchmarks generally rely on labor-intensive manual curation, which
causes excessive time and resource consumption. They also exhibit significant
redundancy and limited difficulty. To alleviate these problems, we introduce
SafetyFlow, the first agent-flow system designed to automate the construction
of LLM safety benchmarks. SafetyFlow can automatically build a comprehensive
safety benchmark in only four days without any human intervention by
orchestrating seven specialized agents, significantly reducing time and
resource cost. Equipped with versatile tools, the agents of SafetyFlow ensure
process and cost controllability while integrating human expertise into the
automatic pipeline. The final constructed dataset, SafetyFlowBench, contains
23,446 queries with low redundancy and strong discriminative power. Our
contribution includes the first fully automated benchmarking pipeline and a
comprehensive safety benchmark. We evaluate the safety of 49 advanced LLMs on
our dataset and conduct extensive experiments to validate our efficacy and
efficiency.

TL;DR: SDGO是一个自判别引导的强化学习框架，利用LLM自身的判别能力作为奖励信号，通过迭代自改进来增强生成安全性，无需额外标注数据或外部模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现LLM作为判别器识别有害请求的能力远强于作为生成器防御有害内容的能力，这种安全不一致性促使研究者探索对齐模型的判别和生成能力。

Method: 提出SDGO强化学习框架，使用模型自身的判别能力作为奖励信号，通过迭代自改进来增强生成安全性，训练阶段无需额外标注数据或外部模型。

Result: SDGO显著提高了模型安全性，在保持通用基准测试有用性的同时，对分布外越狱攻击表现出鲁棒性能，仅需少量判别样本就能进一步增强生成能力。

Conclusion: 通过对齐LLM的判别和生成能力，SDGO实现了两种能力的紧密耦合，为提升模型安全性提供了有效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at various natural language processing
tasks but remain vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks that induce harmful content
generation. In this paper, we reveal a critical safety inconsistency: LLMs can
more effectively identify harmful requests as discriminators than defend
against them as generators. This insight inspires us to explore aligning the
model's inherent discrimination and generation capabilities. To this end, we
propose SDGO (Self-Discrimination-Guided Optimization), a reinforcement
learning framework that leverages the model's own discrimination capabilities
as a reward signal to enhance generation safety through iterative
self-improvement. Our method does not require any additional annotated data or
external models during the training phase. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that SDGO significantly improves model safety compared to both prompt-based and
training-based baselines while maintaining helpfulness on general benchmarks.
By aligning LLMs' discrimination and generation capabilities, SDGO brings
robust performance against out-of-distribution (OOD) jailbreaking attacks. This
alignment achieves tighter coupling between these two capabilities, enabling
the model's generation capability to be further enhanced with only a small
amount of discriminative samples. Our code and datasets are available at

Abstract: Scientific survey articles play a vital role in summarizing research
progress, yet their manual creation is becoming increasingly infeasible due to
the rapid growth of academic literature. While large language models (LLMs)
offer promising capabilities for automating this process, progress in this area
is hindered by the absence of standardized benchmarks and evaluation protocols.
To address this gap, we introduce SurGE (Survey Generation Evaluation), a new
benchmark for evaluating scientific survey generation in the computer science
domain. SurGE consists of (1) a collection of test instances, each including a
topic description, an expert-written survey, and its full set of cited
references, and (2) a large-scale academic corpus of over one million papers
that serves as the retrieval pool. In addition, we propose an automated
evaluation framework that measures generated surveys across four dimensions:
information coverage, referencing accuracy, structural organization, and
content quality. Our evaluation of diverse LLM-based approaches shows that
survey generation remains highly challenging, even for advanced self-reflection
frameworks. These findings highlight the complexity of the task and the
necessity for continued research. We have open-sourced all the code, data, and
models at: https://github.com/oneal2000/SurGE

TL;DR: Pos2Distill是一个位置到位置的知识蒸馏框架，通过将优势位置的能力转移到劣势位置来缓解长上下文处理中的位置偏差问题，在检索和推理任务中都取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 位置偏差（PB）表现为不同上下文位置敏感度不均匀，严重损害长上下文理解能力。尽管先前工作通过修改架构来缓解PB，但显著的PB仍然存在。

Method: 提出Pos2Distill框架，利用位置诱导的差异来对抗PB本身。针对检索和推理范式设计了两个专门实例：Pos2Distill-R¹和Pos2Distill-R²，通过知识蒸馏将优势位置的能力转移到劣势位置。

Result: 使用Pos2Distill方法在长上下文检索和推理任务中实现了增强的均匀性和显著的性能提升。两个专门系统都表现出强大的跨任务泛化能力，同时在各自任务上达到优异性能。

Conclusion: Pos2Distill通过位置到位置的知识蒸馏有效缓解了位置偏差问题，在长上下文处理任务中取得了显著改进，并展示了良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Positional bias (PB), manifesting as non-uniform sensitivity across different
contextual locations, significantly impairs long-context comprehension and
processing capabilities. While prior work seeks to mitigate PB through
modifying the architectures causing its emergence, significant PB still
persists. To address PB effectively, we introduce \textbf{Pos2Distill}, a
position to position knowledge distillation framework. Pos2Distill transfers
the superior capabilities from advantageous positions to less favorable ones,
thereby reducing the huge performance gaps. The conceptual principle is to
leverage the inherent, position-induced disparity to counteract the PB itself.
We identify distinct manifestations of PB under \textbf{\textsc{r}}etrieval and
\textbf{\textsc{r}}easoning paradigms, thereby designing two specialized
instantiations: \emph{Pos2Distill-R\textsuperscript{1}} and
\emph{Pos2Distill-R\textsuperscript{2}} respectively, both grounded in this
core principle. By employing the Pos2Distill approach, we achieve enhanced
uniformity and significant performance gains across all contextual positions in
long-context retrieval and reasoning tasks. Crucially, both specialized systems
exhibit strong cross-task generalization mutually, while achieving superior
performance on their respective tasks.

TL;DR: 本文对孟加拉语词干提取方法进行全面调查，指出该领域存在显著研究空白，批判现有评估方法，并提出未来发展方向的建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 孟加拉语作为全球第七大语言拥有3亿母语者，但在数字领域代表性不足，缺乏标注数据集和资源。词干提取对于这种低资源、高屈折性语言的语言分析至关重要。

Method: 通过文献综述和现有研究的系统性调查，分析孟加拉语词干提取方法的现状、存在的问题和评估方法的不足。

Result: 发现孟加拉语词干提取研究存在显著断层，可复现的实现稀缺，现有评估指标不够相关，且缺乏对丰富形态和方言多样性的有效处理。

Conclusion: 建议开发更强大的孟加拉语词干提取器，采用更相关的评估指标，并持续进行研究以提升语言分析和处理能力。

Abstract: Bangla, the seventh most widely spoken language worldwide with 300 million
native speakers, faces digital under-representation due to limited resources
and lack of annotated datasets. Stemming, a critical preprocessing step in
language analysis, is essential for low-resource, highly-inflectional languages
like Bangla, because it can reduce the complexity of algorithms and models by
significantly reducing the number of words the algorithm needs to consider.
This paper conducts a comprehensive survey of stemming approaches, emphasizing
the importance of handling morphological variants effectively. While exploring
the landscape of Bangla stemming, it becomes evident that there is a
significant gap in the existing literature. The paper highlights the
discontinuity from previous research and the scarcity of accessible
implementations for replication. Furthermore, it critiques the evaluation
methodologies, stressing the need for more relevant metrics. In the context of
Bangla's rich morphology and diverse dialects, the paper acknowledges the
challenges it poses. To address these challenges, the paper suggests directions
for Bangla stemmer development. It concludes by advocating for robust Bangla
stemmers and continued research in the field to enhance language analysis and
processing.

TL;DR: EcomMMMU是一个包含40万样本、890万图像的大规模电商多模态数据集，研究发现产品图像并不总是提升模型性能，有时反而会降低效果。作者提出了SUMEI方法，通过预测视觉效用值来策略性地使用多图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电商平台拥有丰富的多模态数据，但现有数据集规模有限，无法系统研究图像是否真正增强产品理解能力，或者是否可能引入冗余甚至降低性能。

Method: 构建EcomMMMU数据集（406,190样本，8,989,510图像），包含8个核心任务和专门的VSS子集。提出SUMEI方法，先预测视觉效用值，再策略性地使用多图像进行下游任务。

Result: 分析发现产品图像并不总是提升性能，有时反而会降低效果，表明MLLMs在有效利用丰富视觉内容方面存在困难。SUMEI方法在综合实验中显示出有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 需要更智能的多图像利用策略，SUMEI通过数据驱动的方法有效解决了MLLMs在电商任务中视觉内容利用的挑战。

Abstract: E-commerce platforms are rich in multimodal data, featuring a variety of
images that depict product details. However, this raises an important question:
do these images always enhance product understanding, or can they sometimes
introduce redundancy or degrade performance? Existing datasets are limited in
both scale and design, making it difficult to systematically examine this
question. To this end, we introduce EcomMMMU, an e-commerce multimodal
multitask understanding dataset with 406,190 samples and 8,989,510 images.
EcomMMMU is comprised of multi-image visual-language data designed with 8
essential tasks and a specialized VSS subset to benchmark the capability of
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to effectively utilize visual content.
Analysis on EcomMMMU reveals that product images do not consistently improve
performance and can, in some cases, degrade it. This indicates that MLLMs may
struggle to effectively leverage rich visual content for e-commerce tasks.
Building on these insights, we propose SUMEI, a data-driven method that
strategically utilizes multiple images via predicting visual utilities before
using them for downstream tasks. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of SUMEI. The data and code are available through
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/submission25.

Motivation: 当前医疗大语言模型存在知识缺口和幻觉问题，传统检索增强方法对外部知识利用不足且缺乏反馈-推理可追溯性，需要更有效的解决方案来提升医疗诊断的准确性和可靠性。

Method: 构建大规模医学检索语料库（包含患者记录和可靠医学知识源），将LLM作为核心智能体，检索语料库作为环境，通过强化学习训练端到端的智能RAG策略，使用格式、检索、推理结构和诊断准确性等多维度定制奖励。

Conclusion: Deep-DxSearch通过强化学习训练的智能RAG框架有效解决了医疗诊断中的知识缺口和幻觉问题，奖励设计和检索语料库组件对性能提升至关重要，为临床医生提供更可靠精确的初步诊断支持。

Abstract: Accurate diagnosis with medical large language models is hindered by
knowledge gaps and hallucinations. Retrieval and tool-augmented methods help,
but their impact is limited by weak use of external knowledge and poor
feedback-reasoning traceability. To address these challenges, We introduce
Deep-DxSearch, an agentic RAG system trained end-to-end with reinforcement
learning (RL) that enables steer tracebale retrieval-augmented reasoning for
medical diagnosis. In Deep-DxSearch, we first construct a large-scale medical
retrieval corpus comprising patient records and reliable medical knowledge
sources to support retrieval-aware reasoning across diagnostic scenarios. More
crutially, we frame the LLM as the core agent and the retrieval corpus as its
environment, using tailored rewards on format, retrieval, reasoning structure,
and diagnostic accuracy, thereby evolving the agentic RAG policy from
large-scale data through RL.
  Experiments demonstrate that our end-to-end agentic RL training framework
consistently outperforms prompt-engineering and training-free RAG approaches
across multiple data centers. After training, Deep-DxSearch achieves
substantial gains in diagnostic accuracy, surpassing strong diagnostic
baselines such as GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and other medical-specific frameworks
for both common and rare disease diagnosis under in-distribution and
out-of-distribution settings. Moreover, ablation studies on reward design and
retrieval corpus components confirm their critical roles, underscoring the
uniqueness and effectiveness of our approach compared with traditional
implementations. Finally, case studies and interpretability analyses highlight
improvements in Deep-DxSearch's diagnostic policy, providing deeper insight
into its performance gains and supporting clinicians in delivering more
reliable and precise preliminary diagnoses. See

Motivation: 尽管LLM在推理任务上取得进展，但在精确计算方面仍存在不足。工具集成推理(TIR)被提出作为解决方案，但其对LLM推理能力的泛化效果和改进机制尚不明确。

Method: 提出了ReasonZoo基准测试，涵盖9个不同的推理类别，用于评估TIR在各领域的有效性。同时提出了两个新指标：性能感知成本(PAC)和性能-成本曲线下面积(AUC-PCC)来评估推理效率。

Result: 实证评估显示，启用TIR的模型在数学和非数学任务中均持续优于非TIR模型。TIR提高了推理效率，表现为改进的PAC和AUC-PCC指标，表明减少了过度思考并实现了更简化的推理过程。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了TIR的领域通用优势及其在提升LLM复杂推理任务能力方面的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in reasoning tasks
through methods like chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. However, they often fall
short in tasks requiring precise computations. Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR)
has emerged as a solution by incorporating external tools into the reasoning
process. Nevertheless, the generalization of TIR in improving the reasoning
ability of LLM is still unclear. Additionally, whether TIR has improved the
model's reasoning behavior and helped the model think remains to be studied. We
introduce ReasonZoo, a comprehensive benchmark encompassing nine diverse
reasoning categories, to evaluate the effectiveness of TIR across various
domains. Additionally, we propose two novel metrics, Performance-Aware Cost
(PAC) and Area Under the Performance-Cost Curve (AUC-PCC), to assess reasoning
efficiency. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that TIR-enabled models
consistently outperform their non-TIR counterparts in both mathematical and
non-mathematical tasks. Furthermore, TIR enhances reasoning efficiency, as
evidenced by improved PAC and AUC-PCC, indicating reduced overthinking and more
streamlined reasoning. These findings underscore the domain-general benefits of
TIR and its potential to advance LLM capabilities in complex reasoning tasks.

this work, we present LiveMCP-101, a benchmark of 101 carefully curated
real-world queries, refined through iterative LLM rewriting and manual review,
that require coordinated use of multiple MCP tools including web search, file
operations, mathematical reasoning, and data analysis. Moreover, we introduce a
novel evaluation approach that leverages ground-truth execution plans rather
than raw API outputs, better reflecting the evolving nature of real-world

Motivation: 当前基于热图回归的面部关键点检测方法普遍使用Soft-argmax作为可微近似，但这种方法并非唯一选择。作者希望探索更有效的替代方案。

Method: 提出了基于经典结构化预测框架的替代训练目标，避免了传统Soft-argmax方法的使用，实现了端到端的可微训练。

Result: 在WFLW、COFW和300W三个面部关键点基准数据集上达到了最先进性能，训练收敛速度提升2.2倍，同时保持了更好/竞争性的准确率。

Conclusion: Soft-argmax并非面部关键点检测的唯一有效方法，基于结构化预测的替代方案能够实现更快的收敛速度和竞争性的性能表现。

Abstract: Facial landmark detection is an important task in computer vision with
numerous applications, such as head pose estimation, expression analysis, face
swapping, etc. Heatmap regression-based methods have been widely used to
achieve state-of-the-art results in this task. These methods involve computing
the argmax over the heatmaps to predict a landmark. Since argmax is not
differentiable, these methods use a differentiable approximation, Soft-argmax,
to enable end-to-end training on deep-nets. In this work, we revisit this
long-standing choice of using Soft-argmax and demonstrate that it is not the
only way to achieve strong performance. Instead, we propose an alternative
training objective based on the classic structured prediction framework.
Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three facial
landmark benchmarks (WFLW, COFW, and 300W), converging 2.2x faster during
training while maintaining better/competitive accuracy. Our code is available

Conclusion: GCN与Voronoi图的结合为图像分类提供了新的视角，拓展了基于图的学习范式在计算机视觉和非结构化数据分析中的应用潜力。

Abstract: The rapid progress in image classification has been largely driven by the
adoption of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), which offer a robust framework
for handling complex data structures. This study introduces a novel approach
that integrates GCNs with Voronoi diagrams to enhance image classification by
leveraging their ability to effectively model relational data. Unlike
conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), our method represents images
as graphs, where pixels or regions function as vertices. These graphs are then
refined using corresponding Delaunay triangulations, optimizing their
representation. The proposed model achieves significant improvements in both
preprocessing efficiency and classification accuracy across various benchmark
datasets, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in challenging
scenarios involving intricate scenes and fine-grained categories. Experimental
results, validated through cross-validation, underscore the effectiveness of
combining GCNs with Voronoi diagrams for advancing image classification. This
research not only presents a novel perspective on image classification but also
expands the potential applications of graph-based learning paradigms in
computer vision and unstructured data analysis.

TL;DR: YOPO是一个单阶段、基于查询的框架，将类别级9-DoF姿态估计作为2D检测的自然扩展，仅使用RGB图像就实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖伪深度、CAD模型或多阶段级联，需要更简单的纯RGB替代方案来直接从类别级别学习。

Method: 在transformer检测器基础上增加轻量级姿态头、边界框条件平移模块和6D感知匈牙利匹配成本，端到端训练。

Result: 在REAL275数据集上达到79.6% IoU50和54.1% 10°10cm指标，超越所有RGB方法并接近RGB-D系统性能。

Conclusion: YOPO证明了单阶段RGB方法可以实现高性能的9-DoF姿态估计，无需额外数据即可统一目标检测和姿态估计。

Abstract: Accurately recovering the full 9-DoF pose of unseen instances within specific
categories from a single RGB image remains a core challenge for robotics and
automation. Most existing solutions still rely on pseudo-depth, CAD models, or
multi-stage cascades that separate 2D detection from pose estimation. Motivated
by the need for a simpler, RGB-only alternative that learns directly at the
category level, we revisit a longstanding question: Can object detection and
9-DoF pose estimation be unified with high performance, without any additional
data? We show that they can with our method, YOPO, a single-stage, query-based
framework that treats category-level 9-DoF estimation as a natural extension of
2D detection. YOPO augments a transformer detector with a lightweight pose
head, a bounding-box-conditioned translation module, and a 6D-aware Hungarian
matching cost. The model is trained end-to-end only with RGB images and
category-level pose labels. Despite its minimalist design, YOPO sets a new
state of the art on three benchmarks. On the REAL275 dataset, it achieves 79.6%
$\rm{IoU}_{50}$ and 54.1% under the $10^\circ$$10{\rm{cm}}$ metric, surpassing
prior RGB-only methods and closing much of the gap to RGB-D systems. The code,
models, and additional qualitative results can be found on our project.

Motivation: 传统人脸识别系统对物理呈现攻击和数字伪造使用分离的检测模型，增加了系统复杂性和延迟，且无法应对组合攻击向量

Method: 提出配对采样对比框架，利用自动匹配的真实和攻击自拍对来学习模态无关的活体线索，实现轻量级统一训练

Result: 在第六届人脸反欺骗挑战赛统一物理-数字攻击检测基准上达到2.10%的平均分类错误率，计算量仅4.46 GFLOPs，训练时间不到1小时

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个实用、高效的人脸反欺骗解决方案，能够同时处理物理和数字攻击，适合实际部署

Abstract: Modern face recognition systems remain vulnerable to spoofing attempts,
including both physical presentation attacks and digital forgeries.
Traditionally, these two attack vectors have been handled by separate models,
each targeting its own artifacts and modalities. However, maintaining distinct
detectors increases system complexity and inference latency and leaves systems
exposed to combined attack vectors. We propose the Paired-Sampling Contrastive
Framework, a unified training approach that leverages automatically matched
pairs of genuine and attack selfies to learn modality-agnostic liveness cues.
Evaluated on the 6th Face Anti-Spoofing Challenge Unified Physical-Digital
Attack Detection benchmark, our method achieves an average classification error
rate (ACER) of 2.10 percent, outperforming prior solutions. The framework is
lightweight (4.46 GFLOPs) and trains in under one hour, making it practical for
real-world deployment. Code and pretrained models are available at

*Susim Roy,Anubhooti Jain,Mayank Vatsa,Richa Singh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TAIGen是一种无需训练的黑盒对抗图像生成方法，通过仅需3-20个采样步骤从无条件扩散模型中高效生成高质量对抗样本，比现有方法快10倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型的对抗攻击通常产生低质量图像且需要大量计算资源，扩散模型虽然能生成高质量图像但需要数百个采样步骤。

Method: 在混合步骤区间注入扰动，采用选择性RGB通道策略：对红色通道应用注意力图，对绿色和蓝色通道使用GradCAM引导的扰动，保持图像结构的同时最大化目标模型的误分类。

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上，TAIGen对VGGNet源模型的攻击成功率达到：ResNet 70.6%、MNASNet 80.8%、ShuffleNet 97.8%，PSNR超过30dB保持视觉质量。

Conclusion: TAIGen是最具影响力的攻击方法，防御机制对其生成的图像净化效果最差，实现了最低的鲁棒准确率。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks from generative models often produce low-quality images
and require substantial computational resources. Diffusion models, though
capable of high-quality generation, typically need hundreds of sampling steps
for adversarial generation. This paper introduces TAIGen, a training-free
black-box method for efficient adversarial image generation. TAIGen produces
adversarial examples using only 3-20 sampling steps from unconditional
diffusion models. Our key finding is that perturbations injected during the
mixing step interval achieve comparable attack effectiveness without processing
all timesteps. We develop a selective RGB channel strategy that applies
attention maps to the red channel while using GradCAM-guided perturbations on
green and blue channels. This design preserves image structure while maximizing
misclassification in target models. TAIGen maintains visual quality with PSNR
above 30 dB across all tested datasets. On ImageNet with VGGNet as source,
TAIGen achieves 70.6% success against ResNet, 80.8% against MNASNet, and 97.8%
against ShuffleNet. The method generates adversarial examples 10x faster than
existing diffusion-based attacks. Our method achieves the lowest robust
accuracy, indicating it is the most impactful attack as the defense mechanism
is least successful in purifying the images generated by TAIGen.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RUN++是一个可逆展开网络，通过生成式细化解决隐蔽视觉感知问题，在掩码和RGB域同时应用可逆建模，并利用扩散模型处理不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CVP方法主要局限于掩码域的可逆策略，未能充分利用RGB域的潜力，且处理不确定性能力有限。

Method: 将CVP任务建模为数学优化问题，展开为多阶段深度网络，包含CORE（掩码域可逆建模）、CARE（RGB域可逆建模）和FINE（基于伯努利扩散模型的细化）三个模块。

Result: 提出的方法能够有效减少假阳性和假阴性，在真实世界退化条件下保持鲁棒性，计算效率高。

Conclusion: RUN++通过可逆展开网络和生成式细化的协同作用，为CVP任务提供了新的解决方案，并建立了更鲁棒的CVP系统框架。

Abstract: Existing methods for concealed visual perception (CVP) often leverage
reversible strategies to decrease uncertainty, yet these are typically confined
to the mask domain, leaving the potential of the RGB domain underexplored. To
address this, we propose a reversible unfolding network with generative
refinement, termed RUN++. Specifically, RUN++ first formulates the CVP task as
a mathematical optimization problem and unfolds the iterative solution into a
multi-stage deep network. This approach provides a principled way to apply
reversible modeling across both mask and RGB domains while leveraging a
diffusion model to resolve the resulting uncertainty. Each stage of the network
integrates three purpose-driven modules: a Concealed Object Region Extraction
(CORE) module applies reversible modeling to the mask domain to identify core
object regions; a Context-Aware Region Enhancement (CARE) module extends this
principle to the RGB domain to foster better foreground-background separation;
and a Finetuning Iteration via Noise-based Enhancement (FINE) module provides a
final refinement. The FINE module introduces a targeted Bernoulli diffusion
model that refines only the uncertain regions of the segmentation mask,
harnessing the generative power of diffusion for fine-detail restoration
without the prohibitive computational cost of a full-image process. This unique
synergy, where the unfolding network provides a strong uncertainty prior for
the diffusion model, allows RUN++ to efficiently direct its focus toward
ambiguous areas, significantly mitigating false positives and negatives.
Furthermore, we introduce a new paradigm for building robust CVP systems that
remain effective under real-world degradations and extend this concept into a
broader bi-level optimization framework.

TL;DR: CurveFlow提出了一种新的流匹配框架，通过引入曲率正则化来学习非线性轨迹，显著提升了文本到图像生成的语义一致性和图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的整流流模型基于数据和噪声分布之间的线性轨迹，这种线性强制零曲率可能会迫使图像生成过程通过数据流形的低概率区域。需要探索轨迹曲率与生成图像语义对齐之间的关系。

Method: 引入CurveFlow框架，通过曲率指导直接融入流路径来学习平滑的非线性轨迹，采用鲁棒的曲率正则化技术惩罚轨迹内在动态的突变。

Result: 在MS COCO 2014和2017数据集上的实验表明，CurveFlow在文本到图像生成方面达到最先进性能，显著优于标准整流流变体和其他非线性基线，在BLEU、METEOR、ROUGE和CLAIR等语义一致性指标上表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: 曲率感知建模显著增强了模型忠实遵循复杂指令的能力，同时保持高质量的图像生成效果。

Abstract: Existing rectified flow models are based on linear trajectories between data
and noise distributions. This linearity enforces zero curvature, which can
inadvertently force the image generation process through low-probability
regions of the data manifold. A key question remains underexplored: how does
the curvature of these trajectories correlate with the semantic alignment
between generated images and their corresponding captions, i.e., instructional
compliance? To address this, we introduce CurveFlow, a novel flow matching
framework designed to learn smooth, non-linear trajectories by directly
incorporating curvature guidance into the flow path. Our method features a
robust curvature regularization technique that penalizes abrupt changes in the
trajectory's intrinsic dynamics.Extensive experiments on MS COCO 2014 and 2017
demonstrate that CurveFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance in
text-to-image generation, significantly outperforming both standard rectified
flow variants and other non-linear baselines like Rectified Diffusion. The
improvements are especially evident in semantic consistency metrics such as
BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, and CLAIR. This confirms that our curvature-aware modeling
substantially enhances the model's ability to faithfully follow complex
instructions while simultaneously maintaining high image quality. The code is
made publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiRQA是一个自监督的无参考图像质量评估框架，通过分层排序和对齐学习实现质量感知嵌入，无需参考图像或主观标签，在合成和真实失真上均表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的无参考图像质量评估方法存在数据集偏差和依赖主观标签的问题，限制了其泛化性能。需要开发不依赖原始参考图像或辅助模态的自监督方法。

Method: 提出HiRQA框架，结合排序学习和对比学习：1）高阶排序损失监督质量预测的关系排序；2）嵌入距离损失确保特征距离与感知差异一致；3）基于结构化文本提示的对比对齐损失增强表示学习。

Result: 仅在合成失真上训练，HiRQA能有效泛化到真实退化（如镜头光晕、雾霾、运动模糊、低光条件）。轻量版HiRQA-S推理时间仅3.5ms/图像，在合成和真实基准测试中达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: HiRQA通过分层排序和对齐学习实现了强大的泛化能力，为无参考图像质量评估提供了有效的自监督解决方案，具有很好的可扩展性和实时部署能力。

Abstract: Despite significant progress in no-reference image quality assessment
(NR-IQA), dataset biases and reliance on subjective labels continue to hinder
their generalization performance. We propose HiRQA, Hierarchical Ranking and
Quality Alignment), a self-supervised, opinion-unaware framework that offers a
hierarchical, quality-aware embedding through a combination of ranking and
contrastive learning. Unlike prior approaches that depend on pristine
references or auxiliary modalities at inference time, HiRQA predicts quality
scores using only the input image. We introduce a novel higher-order ranking
loss that supervises quality predictions through relational ordering across
distortion pairs, along with an embedding distance loss that enforces
consistency between feature distances and perceptual differences. A
training-time contrastive alignment loss, guided by structured textual prompts,
further enhances the learned representation. Trained only on synthetic
distortions, HiRQA generalizes effectively to authentic degradations, as
demonstrated through evaluation on various distortions such as lens flare,
haze, motion blur, and low-light conditions. For real-time deployment, we
introduce \textbf{HiRQA-S}, a lightweight variant with an inference time of
only 3.5 ms per image. Extensive experiments across synthetic and authentic
benchmarks validate HiRQA's state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, strong
generalization ability, and scalability.

Abstract: Multi-view 3D reconstruction applications are revolutionizing critical use
cases that require rapid situational-awareness, such as emergency response,
tactical scenarios, and public safety. In many cases, their near-real-time
latency requirements and ad-hoc needs for compute resources necessitate
adoption of `Just-in-time' edge environments where the system is set up on the
fly to support the applications during the mission lifetime. However,
reliability issues can arise from the inherent dynamism and operational
adversities of such edge environments, resulting in spatiotemporally correlated
disruptions that impact the camera operations, which can lead to sustained
degradation of reconstruction quality. In this paper, we propose a novel
portfolio theory inspired edge resource management strategy for reliable
multi-view 3D reconstruction against possible system disruptions. Our proposed
methodology can guarantee reconstruction quality satisfaction even when the
cameras are prone to spatiotemporally correlated disruptions. The portfolio
theoretic optimization problem is solved using a genetic algorithm that
converges quickly for realistic system settings. Using publicly available and
customized 3D datasets, we demonstrate the proposed camera selection strategy's
benefits in guaranteeing reliable 3D reconstruction against traditional
baseline strategies, under spatiotemporal disruptions.

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a major cause of global blindness, necessitating
early and accurate diagnosis. While deep learning models have shown promise in
DR detection, their black-box nature often hinders clinical adoption due to a
lack of transparency and interpretability. To address this, we propose XDR-LVLM
(eXplainable Diabetic Retinopathy Diagnosis with LVLM), a novel framework that
leverages Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) for high-precision DR diagnosis
coupled with natural language-based explanations. XDR-LVLM integrates a
specialized Medical Vision Encoder, an LVLM Core, and employs Multi-task Prompt
Engineering and Multi-stage Fine-tuning to deeply understand pathological
features within fundus images and generate comprehensive diagnostic reports.
These reports explicitly include DR severity grading, identification of key
pathological concepts (e.g., hemorrhages, exudates, microaneurysms), and
detailed explanations linking observed features to the diagnosis. Extensive
experiments on the Diabetic Retinopathy (DDR) dataset demonstrate that XDR-LVLM
achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a Balanced Accuracy of 84.55% and
an F1 Score of 79.92% for disease diagnosis, and superior results for concept
detection (77.95% BACC, 66.88% F1). Furthermore, human evaluations confirm the
high fluency, accuracy, and clinical utility of the generated explanations,
showcasing XDR-LVLM's ability to bridge the gap between automated diagnosis and
clinical needs by providing robust and interpretable insights.

Conclusion: MeSS方法成功解决了城市网格模型纹理缺失问题，为虚拟城市导航和自动驾驶提供了高质量的3D场景生成解决方案

Abstract: Mesh models have become increasingly accessible for numerous cities; however,
the lack of realistic textures restricts their application in virtual urban
navigation and autonomous driving. To address this, this paper proposes MeSS
(Meshbased Scene Synthesis) for generating high-quality, styleconsistent
outdoor scenes with city mesh models serving as the geometric prior. While
image and video diffusion models can leverage spatial layouts (such as depth
maps or HD maps) as control conditions to generate street-level perspective
views, they are not directly applicable to 3D scene generation. Video diffusion
models excel at synthesizing consistent view sequences that depict scenes but
often struggle to adhere to predefined camera paths or align accurately with
rendered control videos. In contrast, image diffusion models, though unable to
guarantee cross-view visual consistency, can produce more geometry-aligned
results when combined with ControlNet. Building on this insight, our approach
enhances image diffusion models by improving cross-view consistency. The
pipeline comprises three key stages: first, we generate geometrically
consistent sparse views using Cascaded Outpainting ControlNets; second, we
propagate denser intermediate views via a component dubbed AGInpaint; and
third, we globally eliminate visual inconsistencies (e.g., varying exposure)
using the GCAlign module. Concurrently with generation, a 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) scene is reconstructed by initializing Gaussian balls on the mesh
surface. Our method outperforms existing approaches in both geometric alignment
and generation quality. Once synthesized, the scene can be rendered in diverse
styles through relighting and style transfer techniques.

Abstract: Existing approaches in reinforcement learning train an agent to learn desired

agents to cause failure scenarios. We evaluate our adversarial agent against

Abstract: Accurate morphological quantification of renal pathology functional units
relies on instance-level segmentation, yet most existing datasets and automated
methods provide only binary (semantic) masks, limiting the precision of
downstream analyses. Although classical post-processing techniques such as
watershed, morphological operations, and skeletonization, are often used to
separate semantic masks into instances, their individual effectiveness is
constrained by the diverse morphologies and complex connectivity found in renal
tissue. In this study, we present DyMorph-B2I, a dynamic, morphology-guided
binary-to-instance segmentation pipeline tailored for renal pathology. Our
approach integrates watershed, skeletonization, and morphological operations
within a unified framework, complemented by adaptive geometric refinement and
customizable hyperparameter tuning for each class of functional unit. Through
systematic parameter optimization, DyMorph-B2I robustly separates adherent and
heterogeneous structures present in binary masks. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms individual classical approaches and
na\"ive combinations, enabling superior instance separation and facilitating
more accurate morphometric analysis in renal pathology workflows. The pipeline

Abstract: Accident prediction and timely warnings play a key role in improving road
safety by reducing the risk of injury to road users and minimizing property
damage. Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are designed to support human
drivers and are especially useful when they can anticipate potential accidents
before they happen. While many existing systems depend on a range of sensors
such as LiDAR, radar, and GPS, relying solely on dash-cam video input presents
a more challenging but a more cost-effective and easily deployable solution. In
this work, we incorporate better spatio-temporal features and aggregate them
through a recurrent network to improve upon state-of-the-art graph neural
networks for predicting accidents from dash-cam videos. Experiments using three
publicly available datasets show that our proposed STAGNet model achieves
higher average precision and mean time-to-collision values than previous
methods, both when cross-validated on a given dataset and when trained and
tested on different datasets.

TL;DR: TriMM是首个前馈式3D原生生成模型，通过协同多模态编码整合RGB、RGBD和点云数据，利用triplane潜在扩散模型生成高质量3D资产，在少量训练数据下实现与大规模数据集训练模型竞争的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D生成架构大多局限于单一模态或3D结构，忽略了多模态数据的互补优势，限制了可用训练数据集的范围。为了充分利用多模态进行3D建模，需要开发能够整合不同模态优势的生成模型。

Conclusion: TriMM成功证明了多模态数据在3D生成中的价值，通过协同多模态编码和triplane扩散模型，能够生成纹理和几何细节都更优越的3D资产，为多模态3D生成开辟了新方向。

Abstract: 3D content inherently encompasses multi-modal characteristics and can be
projected into different modalities (e.g., RGB images, RGBD, and point clouds).
Each modality exhibits distinct advantages in 3D asset modeling: RGB images
contain vivid 3D textures, whereas point clouds define fine-grained 3D
geometries. However, most existing 3D-native generative architectures either
operate predominantly within single-modality paradigms-thus overlooking the
complementary benefits of multi-modality data-or restrict themselves to 3D
structures, thereby limiting the scope of available training datasets. To
holistically harness multi-modalities for 3D modeling, we present TriMM, the
first feed-forward 3D-native generative model that learns from basic
multi-modalities (e.g., RGB, RGBD, and point cloud). Specifically, 1) TriMM
first introduces collaborative multi-modal coding, which integrates
modality-specific features while preserving their unique representational
strengths. 2) Furthermore, auxiliary 2D and 3D supervision are introduced to
raise the robustness and performance of multi-modal coding. 3) Based on the
embedded multi-modal code, TriMM employs a triplane latent diffusion model to
generate 3D assets of superior quality, enhancing both the texture and the
geometric detail. Extensive experiments on multiple well-known datasets
demonstrate that TriMM, by effectively leveraging multi-modality, achieves
competitive performance with models trained on large-scale datasets, despite
utilizing a small amount of training data. Furthermore, we conduct additional
experiments on recent RGB-D datasets, verifying the feasibility of
incorporating other multi-modal datasets into 3D generation.

Result: 在五个数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法相比最先进方法具有有效性

Conclusion: 该方法能有效避免类间冲突、减少原型漂移，并提供可靠的原型计算保证

Abstract: Contrastive learning is widely used in clustering tasks due to its
discriminative representation. However, the conflict problem between classes is
difficult to solve effectively. Existing methods try to solve this problem
through prototype contrast, but there is a deviation between the calculation of
hard prototypes and the true cluster center. To address this problem, we
propose a center-oriented prototype contrastive clustering framework, which
consists of a soft prototype contrastive module and a dual consistency learning
module. In short, the soft prototype contrastive module uses the probability
that the sample belongs to the cluster center as a weight to calculate the
prototype of each category, while avoiding inter-class conflicts and reducing
prototype drift. The dual consistency learning module aligns different
transformations of the same sample and the neighborhoods of different samples
respectively, ensuring that the features have transformation-invariant semantic
information and compact intra-cluster distribution, while providing reliable
guarantees for the calculation of prototypes. Extensive experiments on five
datasets show that the proposed method is effective compared to the SOTA. Our
code is published on https://github.com/LouisDong95/CPCC.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统无人机视觉语言导航存在轨迹过长、机动复杂的问题，需要人工干预或过于详细的指令。利用无人机高空多粒度视角优势，同时保持可控的运动空间。

Method: 提出双无人机协作框架AeroDuo：高空无人机使用多模态大语言模型(Pilot-LLM)进行目标推理，低空无人机采用轻量级多阶段策略进行导航和目标定位，仅交换最小坐标信息确保效率。

Result: 构建了HaL-13k数据集，包含13,838条协作高低空无人机演示轨迹，配备目标导向语言指令，包含未见地图和未见对象验证集以评估泛化能力。

Conclusion: 双高度无人机协作方法能够有效利用各自优势，高空负责环境推理，低空负责精确导航，为无人机视觉语言导航提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Aerial Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is an emerging task that enables
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to navigate outdoor environments using natural
language instructions and visual cues. However, due to the extended
trajectories and complex maneuverability of UAVs, achieving reliable UAV-VLN
performance is challenging and often requires human intervention or overly
detailed instructions. To harness the advantages of UAVs' high mobility, which
could provide multi-grained perspectives, while maintaining a manageable motion
space for learning, we introduce a novel task called Dual-Altitude UAV
Collaborative VLN (DuAl-VLN). In this task, two UAVs operate at distinct
altitudes: a high-altitude UAV responsible for broad environmental reasoning,
and a low-altitude UAV tasked with precise navigation. To support the training
and evaluation of the DuAl-VLN, we construct the HaL-13k, a dataset comprising
13,838 collaborative high-low UAV demonstration trajectories, each paired with
target-oriented language instructions. This dataset includes both unseen maps
and an unseen object validation set to systematically evaluate the model's
generalization capabilities across novel environments and unfamiliar targets.
To consolidate their complementary strengths, we propose a dual-UAV
collaborative VLN framework, AeroDuo, where the high-altitude UAV integrates a
multimodal large language model (Pilot-LLM) for target reasoning, while the
low-altitude UAV employs a lightweight multi-stage policy for navigation and
target grounding. The two UAVs work collaboratively and only exchange minimal
coordinate information to ensure efficiency.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传播模型并行生成效率低的问题，现有方法如DDIM需要构建非马尔可夫过程，本文探索是否可以通过马尔可夫方式实现高效采样。

Method: 提出跳跃步采样机制，直接跳过迭代生成过程中的多个中间去噪步骤，并与DDIM相结合来提升生成质量。

Result: 在OpenAI ADM、Stable Diffusion和Open Sora等领先传播模型上进行实验，证明方法能够在显著减少采样步数的同时保持高质量生成。

Conclusion: 跳跃步采样是领先训练传播模型的内在特性，通过马尔可夫方式实现了高效加速采样，为传播模型的实时应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have been achieving state-of-the-art results across various
generation tasks. However, a notable drawback is their sequential generation
process, requiring long-sequence step-by-step generation. Existing methods,
such as DDIM, attempt to reduce sampling steps by constructing a class of
non-Markovian diffusion processes that maintain the same training objective.
However, there remains a gap in understanding whether the original diffusion
process can achieve the same efficiency without resorting to non-Markovian
processes. In this paper, we provide a confirmative answer and introduce
skipped-step sampling, a mechanism that bypasses multiple intermediate
denoising steps in the iterative generation process, in contrast with the
traditional step-by-step refinement of standard diffusion inference. Crucially,
we demonstrate that this skipped-step sampling mechanism is derived from the
same training objective as the standard diffusion model, indicating that
accelerated sampling via skipped-step sampling via a Markovian way is an
intrinsic property of pretrained diffusion models. Additionally, we propose an
enhanced generation method by integrating our accelerated sampling technique
with DDIM. Extensive experiments on popular pretrained diffusion models,
including the OpenAI ADM, Stable Diffusion, and Open Sora models, show that our
method achieves high-quality generation with significantly reduced sampling
steps.

Abstract: We present Comp-X, the first intelligently interactive image compression
paradigm empowered by the impressive reasoning capability of large language
model (LLM) agent. Notably, commonly used image codecs usually suffer from
limited coding modes and rely on manual mode selection by engineers, making
them unfriendly for unprofessional users. To overcome this, we advance the
evolution of image coding paradigm by introducing three key innovations: (i)
multi-functional coding framework, which unifies different coding modes of
various objective/requirements, including human-machine perception, variable
coding, and spatial bit allocation, into one framework. (ii) interactive coding
agent, where we propose an augmented in-context learning method with coding
expert feedback to teach the LLM agent how to understand the coding request,
mode selection, and the use of the coding tools. (iii) IIC-bench, the first
dedicated benchmark comprising diverse user requests and the corresponding
annotations from coding experts, which is systematically designed for
intelligently interactive image compression evaluation. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed Comp-X can understand the coding requests
efficiently and achieve impressive textual interaction capability. Meanwhile,
it can maintain comparable compression performance even with a single coding
framework, providing a promising avenue for artificial general intelligence
(AGI) in image compression.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法采用先检测后推理的范式，基于一对一分配结果进行监督，导致监督范围有限，拓扑推理性能不佳

Method: 重构Transformer解码器结构，交换交叉注意力和自注意力层顺序；实例化多个并行交叉注意力块以增强车道检测多样性；实现一对多分配策略

Result: 在OpenLane-V2数据集上的实验表明，RATopo策略具有模型无关性，能无缝集成到现有拓扑推理框架中，持续提升车道-车道和车道-交通拓扑性能

Conclusion: 冗余分配策略通过数量丰富和几何多样化的拓扑监督，有效解决了现有方法监督范围有限的问题，显著提升了车道拓扑推理性能

Abstract: Lane topology reasoning plays a critical role in autonomous driving by
modeling the connections among lanes and the topological relationships between
lanes and traffic elements. Most existing methods adopt a
first-detect-then-reason paradigm, where topological relationships are
supervised based on the one-to-one assignment results obtained during the
detection stage. This supervision strategy results in suboptimal topology
reasoning performance due to the limited range of valid supervision. In this
paper, we propose RATopo, a Redundancy Assignment strategy for lane Topology
reasoning that enables quantity-rich and geometry-diverse topology supervision.
Specifically, we restructure the Transformer decoder by swapping the
cross-attention and self-attention layers. This allows redundant lane
predictions to be retained before suppression, enabling effective one-to-many
assignment. We also instantiate multiple parallel cross-attention blocks with
independent parameters, which further enhances the diversity of detected lanes.
Extensive experiments on OpenLane-V2 demonstrate that our RATopo strategy is
model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into existing topology
reasoning frameworks, consistently improving both lane-lane and lane-traffic
topology performance.

Abstract: In the field of design patent analysis, traditional tasks such as patent
classification and patent image retrieval heavily depend on the image data.
However, patent images -- typically consisting of sketches with abstract and
structural elements of an invention -- often fall short in conveying
comprehensive visual context and semantic information. This inadequacy can lead
to ambiguities in evaluation during prior art searches. Recent advancements in
vision-language models, such as CLIP, offer promising opportunities for more
reliable and accurate AI-driven patent analysis. In this work, we leverage CLIP
models to develop a unified framework DesignCLIP for design patent applications
with a large-scale dataset of U.S. design patents. To address the unique
characteristics of patent data, DesignCLIP incorporates class-aware
classification and contrastive learning, utilizing generated detailed captions
for patent images and multi-views image learning. We validate the effectiveness
of DesignCLIP across various downstream tasks, including patent classification
and patent retrieval. Additionally, we explore multimodal patent retrieval,
which provides the potential to enhance creativity and innovation in design by
offering more diverse sources of inspiration. Our experiments show that
DesignCLIP consistently outperforms baseline and SOTA models in the patent
domain on all tasks. Our findings underscore the promise of multimodal
approaches in advancing patent analysis. The codebase is available here:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TPA是一种用于胎儿先天性心脏病超声视频分类的新方法，结合时序建模、提示感知对比学习和不确定性量化，在CHD检测和心脏功能评估方面达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前超声视频CHD检测方法存在三个主要问题：忽略时序信息、仅限于二分类、缺乏预测校准。这些限制了自动化方法在临床中的可靠应用。

Method: 提出时序提示对齐(TPA)框架：1)使用图像编码器提取视频帧特征；2)可训练时序提取器聚合特征捕捉心脏运动；3)通过边界铰链对比损失对齐视频表示与类别特定文本提示；4)引入条件变分自编码器风格调制模块(CVAESM)学习潜在风格向量来调制嵌入并量化分类不确定性。

Result: 在CHD检测上达到85.40%的宏F1分数，预期校准误差降低5.38%，自适应ECE降低6.8%。在EchoNet-Dynamic三分类任务上，宏F1提升4.73%(从53.89%到58.62%)。

Conclusion: TPA通过整合时序建模、提示感知对比学习和不确定性量化，为胎儿先天性心脏病超声视频分类提供了一个有效的框架，显著提升了分类性能和临床可靠性。

Abstract: Congenital heart defect (CHD) detection in ultrasound videos is hindered by
image noise and probe positioning variability. While automated methods can
reduce operator dependence, current machine learning approaches often neglect
temporal information, limit themselves to binary classification, and do not
account for prediction calibration. We propose Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA),
a method leveraging foundation image-text model and prompt-aware contrastive
learning to classify fetal CHD on cardiac ultrasound videos. TPA extracts
features from each frame of video subclips using an image encoder, aggregates
them with a trainable temporal extractor to capture heart motion, and aligns
the video representation with class-specific text prompts via a margin-hinge
contrastive loss. To enhance calibration for clinical reliability, we introduce
a Conditional Variational Autoencoder Style Modulation (CVAESM) module, which
learns a latent style vector to modulate embeddings and quantifies
classification uncertainty. Evaluated on a private dataset for CHD detection
and on a large public dataset, EchoNet-Dynamic, for systolic dysfunction, TPA
achieves state-of-the-art macro F1 scores of 85.40% for CHD diagnosis, while
also reducing expected calibration error by 5.38% and adaptive ECE by 6.8%. On
EchoNet-Dynamic's three-class task, it boosts macro F1 by 4.73% (from 53.89% to
58.62%). Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA) is a framework for fetal congenital
heart defect (CHD) classification in ultrasound videos that integrates temporal
modeling, prompt-aware contrastive learning, and uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: Real-time 3D trajectory player tracking in sports plays a crucial role in
tactical analysis, performance evaluation, and enhancing spectator experience.
Traditional systems rely on multi-camera setups, but are constrained by the
inherently two-dimensional nature of video data and the need for complex 3D
reconstruction processing, making real-time analysis challenging. Basketball,
in particular, represents one of the most difficult scenarios in the MOT field,
as ten players move rapidly and complexly within a confined court space, with
frequent occlusions caused by intense physical contact.
  To address these challenges, this paper constructs BasketLiDAR, the first
multimodal dataset in the sports MOT field that combines LiDAR point clouds
with synchronized multi-view camera footage in a professional basketball
environment, and proposes a novel MOT framework that simultaneously achieves
improved tracking accuracy and reduced computational cost. The BasketLiDAR
dataset contains a total of 4,445 frames and 3,105 player IDs, with fully
synchronized IDs between three LiDAR sensors and three multi-view cameras. We
recorded 5-on-5 and 3-on-3 game data from actual professional basketball
players, providing complete 3D positional information and ID annotations for
each player. Based on this dataset, we developed a novel MOT algorithm that
leverages LiDAR's high-precision 3D spatial information. The proposed method
consists of a real-time tracking pipeline using LiDAR alone and a multimodal
tracking pipeline that fuses LiDAR and camera data. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach achieves real-time operation, which was difficult
with conventional camera-only methods, while achieving superior tracking
performance even under occlusion conditions. The dataset is available upon

Conclusion: RAG-SEG提供了一种无需训练的高效COD解决方案，通过检索增强生成和SAM分割的结合，在保持竞争力的同时显著降低了计算需求。

Abstract: Camouflaged object detection (COD) poses a significant challenge in computer
vision due to the high similarity between objects and their backgrounds.
Existing approaches often rely on heavy training and large computational
resources. While foundation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
offer strong generalization, they still struggle to handle COD tasks without
fine-tuning and require high-quality prompts to yield good performance.
However, generating such prompts manually is costly and inefficient. To address
these challenges, we propose \textbf{First RAG, Second SEG (RAG-SEG)}, a
training-free paradigm that decouples COD into two stages: Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) for generating coarse masks as prompts, followed by SAM-based
segmentation (SEG) for refinement. RAG-SEG constructs a compact retrieval
database via unsupervised clustering, enabling fast and effective feature
retrieval. During inference, the retrieved features produce pseudo-labels that
guide precise mask generation using SAM2. Our method eliminates the need for
conventional training while maintaining competitive performance. Extensive
experiments on benchmark COD datasets demonstrate that RAG-SEG performs on par
with or surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Notably, all experiments are
conducted on a \textbf{personal laptop}, highlighting the computational
efficiency and practicality of our approach. We present further analysis in the
Appendix, covering limitations, salient object detection extension, and
possible improvements.

Conclusion: VideoEraser在抑制文本到视频生成中的不良内容方面达到了最先进的性能，为解决扩散模型的滥用问题提供了一种有效的训练免费解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid growth of text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models has raised concerns
about privacy, copyright, and safety due to their potential misuse in
generating harmful or misleading content. These models are often trained on
numerous datasets, including unauthorized personal identities, artistic
creations, and harmful materials, which can lead to uncontrolled production and
distribution of such content. To address this, we propose VideoEraser, a
training-free framework that prevents T2V diffusion models from generating
videos with undesirable concepts, even when explicitly prompted with those
concepts. Designed as a plug-and-play module, VideoEraser can seamlessly
integrate with representative T2V diffusion models via a two-stage process:
Selective Prompt Embedding Adjustment (SPEA) and Adversarial-Resilient Noise
Guidance (ARNG). We conduct extensive evaluations across four tasks, including
object erasure, artistic style erasure, celebrity erasure, and explicit content
erasure. Experimental results show that VideoEraser consistently outperforms
prior methods regarding efficacy, integrity, fidelity, robustness, and
generalizability. Notably, VideoEraser achieves state-of-the-art performance in
suppressing undesirable content during T2V generation, reducing it by 46% on
average across four tasks compared to baselines.

the intent of crossing the road by pedestrians in an experimental setup. The
study involved working with deep learning models to predict poses and sequence
modelling for temporal predictions. The study analysed three different sequence
modelling to understand the prediction behaviour and it was found out that GRU
was better in predicting the intent compared to LSTM model but 1D CNN was the
best model in terms of speed. The study involved video analysis, and the output
of pose detection model was integrated later on to sequence modelling
techniques for an end-to-end deep learning framework for predicting road

Motivation: 现有Video-LLMs研究主要关注性能提升，对其内部机制理解有限，本文旨在通过系统性实证研究填补这一空白。

Method: 采用注意力敲除作为主要分析工具，设计三种变体：视频时间敲除、视频空间敲除和语言到视频敲除，通过控制敲除层窗口和类型进行全局和细粒度分析。

Result: 发现视频信息提取主要在早期层完成，形成两阶段处理；某些中间层对视频问答有重要影响；时空建模更多依赖语言引导检索而非视频token自注意力。

Conclusion: 这些发现可用于减少Video-LLMs的注意力计算，为未来研究提供可解释性和效率视角，是首个系统揭示Video-LLMs内部视频处理机制的工作。

Abstract: Taking advantage of large-scale data and pretrained language models, Video
Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in answering
video questions. However, most existing efforts focus on improving performance,
with limited attention to understanding their internal mechanisms. This paper
aims to bridge this gap through a systematic empirical study. To interpret
existing VideoLLMs, we adopt attention knockouts as our primary analytical tool
and design three variants: Video Temporal Knockout, Video Spatial Knockout, and
Language-to-Video Knockout. Then, we apply these three knockouts on different
numbers of layers (window of layers). By carefully controlling the window of
layers and types of knockouts, we provide two settings: a global setting and a
fine-grained setting. Our study reveals three key findings: (1) Global setting
indicates Video information extraction primarily occurs in early layers,
forming a clear two-stage process -- lower layers focus on perceptual encoding,
while higher layers handle abstract reasoning; (2) In the fine-grained setting,
certain intermediate layers exert an outsized impact on video question
answering, acting as critical outliers, whereas most other layers contribute
minimally; (3) In both settings, we observe that spatial-temporal modeling
relies more on language-guided retrieval than on intra- and inter-frame
self-attention among video tokens, despite the latter's high computational
cost. Finally, we demonstrate that these insights can be leveraged to reduce
attention computation in Video-LLMs. To our knowledge, this is the first work
to systematically uncover how Video-LLMs internally process and understand
video content, offering interpretability and efficiency perspectives for future
research.

*Jacinto Colan,Ana Davila,Yasuhisa Hasegawa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BioTune是一种进化自适应微调技术，通过进化算法选择性地微调特定层，在保持竞争力的准确率同时减少可训练参数数量和计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统微调方法需要更新所有模型参数，容易导致过拟合和计算成本高。需要一种更高效的迁移学习方法。

Method: 使用进化算法识别出需要微调的层子集，只对这些选定层进行参数更新，而不是整个模型。

Result: 在9个图像分类数据集上的评估显示，BioTune相比AutoRGN和LoRA等方法，在准确率和效率方面都表现竞争性或更好。

Conclusion: 通过聚焦于相关层的子集进行微调，BioTune减少了可训练参数数量，降低了计算成本，实现了更高效的跨域迁移学习。

Abstract: Deep learning has shown substantial progress in image analysis. However, the
computational demands of large, fully trained models remain a consideration.
Transfer learning offers a strategy for adapting pre-trained models to new
tasks. Traditional fine-tuning often involves updating all model parameters,
which can potentially lead to overfitting and higher computational costs. This
paper introduces BioTune, an evolutionary adaptive fine-tuning technique that
selectively fine-tunes layers to enhance transfer learning efficiency. BioTune
employs an evolutionary algorithm to identify a focused set of layers for
fine-tuning, aiming to optimize model performance on a given target task.
Evaluation across nine image classification datasets from various domains
indicates that BioTune achieves competitive or improved accuracy and efficiency
compared to existing fine-tuning methods such as AutoRGN and LoRA. By
concentrating the fine-tuning process on a subset of relevant layers, BioTune
reduces the number of trainable parameters, potentially leading to decreased
computational cost and facilitating more efficient transfer learning across
diverse data characteristics and distributions.

TL;DR: 提出ICGS-Quantizer方法，通过联合利用高斯间和属性间相关性，使用跨场景共享码本，将3DGS压缩到千字节级别，并支持基于图像的场景更新


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3DGS压缩方法只能压缩到兆字节级别，不适用于大规模场景或场景集合的长期归档，且缺乏应对归档后场景变化的机制

Method: 图像条件化高斯溅射量化器，联合利用高斯间和属性间相关性，使用共享码本，编码、量化和解码过程联合训练，支持基于捕获图像的场景解码

Result: 在3D场景压缩和场景更新任务上持续优于最先进方法，将存储需求降低到千字节范围同时保持视觉保真度

Conclusion: ICGS-Quantizer显著提升了压缩效率并提供了归档后场景变化的适应性，解决了现有方法的两个关键限制

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has attracted considerable attention for
enabling high-quality real-time rendering. Although 3DGS compression methods
have been proposed for deployment on storage-constrained devices, two
limitations hinder archival use: (1) they compress medium-scale scenes only to
the megabyte range, which remains impractical for large-scale scenes or
extensive scene collections; and (2) they lack mechanisms to accommodate scene
changes after long-term archival. To address these limitations, we propose an
Image-Conditioned Gaussian Splat Quantizer (ICGS-Quantizer) that substantially
enhances compression efficiency and provides adaptability to scene changes
after archiving. ICGS-Quantizer improves quantization efficiency by jointly
exploiting inter-Gaussian and inter-attribute correlations and by using shared
codebooks across all training scenes, which are then fixed and applied to
previously unseen test scenes, eliminating the overhead of per-scene codebooks.
This approach effectively reduces the storage requirements for 3DGS to the
kilobyte range while preserving visual fidelity. To enable adaptability to
post-archival scene changes, ICGS-Quantizer conditions scene decoding on images
captured at decoding time. The encoding, quantization, and decoding processes
are trained jointly, ensuring that the codes, which are quantized
representations of the scene, are effective for conditional decoding. We
evaluate ICGS-Quantizer on 3D scene compression and 3D scene updating.
Experimental results show that ICGS-Quantizer consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in compression efficiency and adaptability to scene
changes. Our code, model, and data will be publicly available on GitHub.

TL;DR: DriveSplat是一种基于神经高斯表示的动态-静态解耦方法，用于驾驶场景的高质量3D重建，通过区域体素初始化、可变形神经高斯和深度/法线先验监督，在Waymo和KITTI数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 驾驶场景中存在快速移动的车辆、行人和大规模静态背景，现有基于3D高斯泼溅的方法在解耦动态静态组件时忽略了背景优化的几何关系，仅通过添加高斯来拟合训练视图，导致新视角渲染鲁棒性有限且缺乏准确的几何表示。

Method: 1. 区域体素初始化方案：将场景分为近、中、远区域以增强近距离细节表示；2. 可变形神经高斯：通过可学习变形网络建模非刚性动态对象；3. 深度和法线先验监督：使用预训练模型提供的深度和法线信息提高几何结构准确性。

Result: 在Waymo和KITTI数据集上的严格评估表明，该方法在驾驶场景的新视角合成方面达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: DriveSplat通过创新的动态-静态解耦策略和几何先验监督，有效解决了驾驶场景3D重建中的挑战，实现了高质量的新视角渲染和准确的几何表示。

Abstract: In the realm of driving scenarios, the presence of rapidly moving vehicles,
pedestrians in motion, and large-scale static backgrounds poses significant
challenges for 3D scene reconstruction. Recent methods based on 3D Gaussian
Splatting address the motion blur problem by decoupling dynamic and static
components within the scene. However, these decoupling strategies overlook
background optimization with adequate geometry relationships and rely solely on
fitting each training view by adding Gaussians. Therefore, these models exhibit
limited robustness in rendering novel views and lack an accurate geometric
representation. To address the above issues, we introduce DriveSplat, a
high-quality reconstruction method for driving scenarios based on neural
Gaussian representations with dynamic-static decoupling. To better accommodate
the predominantly linear motion patterns of driving viewpoints, a region-wise
voxel initialization scheme is employed, which partitions the scene into near,
middle, and far regions to enhance close-range detail representation.
Deformable neural Gaussians are introduced to model non-rigid dynamic actors,
whose parameters are temporally adjusted by a learnable deformation network.
The entire framework is further supervised by depth and normal priors from
pre-trained models, improving the accuracy of geometric structures. Our method
has been rigorously evaluated on the Waymo and KITTI datasets, demonstrating
state-of-the-art performance in novel-view synthesis for driving scenarios.

Motivation: 解决深度学习模型在抽象推理方面的根本瓶颈，通过RPM问题这一权威基准来提升机器智能的抽象推理、模式识别和复杂问题解决能力。

Method: 采用因果链建模视角分析RPM任务，设计DIO基线网络架构。针对互信息最大化目标的局限性，提出了三种渐进改进方法（具体方法在摘要中未详细说明）。

Result: 实验发现DIO模型的互信息最大化优化目标无法让模型真正获得预定义的人类推理逻辑，主要原因是下界紧致性影响和互信息无法捕捉因果关系。

Conclusion: 需要超越传统的互信息最大化方法，采用更能捕捉因果关系的改进方法来提升模型的抽象推理能力。

Abstract: Despite the outstanding performance of current deep learning models across
various domains, their fundamental bottleneck in abstract reasoning remains
unresolved. To address this challenge, the academic community has introduced
Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) problems as an authoritative benchmark for
evaluating the abstract reasoning capabilities of deep learning algorithms,
with a focus on core intelligence dimensions such as abstract reasoning,
pattern recognition, and complex problem-solving. Therefore, this paper centers
on solving RPM problems, aiming to contribute to enhancing the abstract
reasoning abilities of machine intelligence. Firstly, this paper adopts a
``causal chain modeling'' perspective to systematically analyze the complete
causal chain in RPM tasks: image $\rightarrow$ abstract attributes
$\rightarrow$ progressive attribute patterns $\rightarrow$ pattern consistency
$\rightarrow$ correct answer. Based on this analysis, the network architecture
of the baseline model DIO is designed. However, experiments reveal that the
optimization objective formulated for DIO, namely maximizing the variational
lower bound of mutual information between the context and the correct option,
fails to enable the model to genuinely acquire the predefined human reasoning
logic. This is attributed to two main reasons: the tightness of the lower bound
significantly impacts the effectiveness of mutual information maximization, and
mutual information, as a statistical measure, does not capture the causal
relationship between subjects and objects. To overcome these limitations, this
paper progressively proposes three improvement methods:

Motivation: 随着短视频内容的兴起，高效提取关键信息的视频摘要技术变得至关重要。现有方法难以捕捉全局时序依赖关系，保持视频内容的语义连贯性，并且在多通道特征融合过程中容易受到噪声影响。

Method: 设计基于脉冲神经网络的关键帧提取器，利用SNN的事件驱动计算机制自主学习关键帧特征；引入动态聚合图推理器实现细粒度跨帧推理；提出变分推断重建模块处理多通道特征融合中的不确定性和噪声问题。

Conclusion: 所提出的SpiVG网络通过结合脉冲神经网络、图推理和变分推断技术，有效提升了视频摘要的性能，在信息密度和计算复杂度方面都有显著改进。

Abstract: With the rise of short video content, efficient video summarization
techniques for extracting key information have become crucial. However,
existing methods struggle to capture the global temporal dependencies and
maintain the semantic coherence of video content. Additionally, these methods
are also influenced by noise during multi-channel feature fusion. We propose a
Spiking Variational Graph (SpiVG) Network, which enhances information density
and reduces computational complexity. First, we design a keyframe extractor
based on Spiking Neural Networks (SNN), leveraging the event-driven computation
mechanism of SNNs to learn keyframe features autonomously. To enable
fine-grained and adaptable reasoning across video frames, we introduce a
Dynamic Aggregation Graph Reasoner, which decouples contextual object
consistency from semantic perspective coherence. We present a Variational
Inference Reconstruction Module to address uncertainty and noise arising during
multi-channel feature fusion. In this module, we employ Evidence Lower Bound
Optimization (ELBO) to capture the latent structure of multi-channel feature
distributions, using posterior distribution regularization to reduce
overfitting. Experimental results show that SpiVG surpasses existing methods
across multiple datasets such as SumMe, TVSum, VideoXum, and QFVS. Our codes
and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/liwrui/SpiVG.

Motivation: 尽管MAE在视觉基础模型预训练中表现出色，但在新数据集上应用时需要大量超参数调优。现有理论研究主要关注注意力模式和分层潜变量模型，而MAE超参数与下游任务性能之间的关系相对未被探索。

Method: 通过分析推导线性MAE学习的特征，并扩展到非线性MAE，研究MAE表示如何适应数据集中的空间相关性。

Result: 研究发现掩码比例和补丁大小可以控制MAE学习短程和长程空间相关性的能力，MAE表示能够适应超越二阶统计量的数据集空间相关性。

Conclusion: 研究为实践中如何选择MAE超参数提供了理论见解，揭示了MAE学习空间相关性的机制。

Abstract: Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) have emerged as a powerful pretraining technique
for vision foundation models. Despite their effectiveness, they require
extensive hyperparameter tuning (masking ratio, patch size, encoder/decoder
layers) when applied to novel datasets. While prior theoretical works have
analyzed MAEs in terms of their attention patterns and hierarchical latent
variable models, the connection between MAE hyperparameters and performance on
downstream tasks is relatively unexplored. This work investigates how MAEs
learn spatial correlations in the input image. We analytically derive the
features learned by a linear MAE and show that masking ratio and patch size can
be used to select for features that capture short- and long-range spatial
correlations. We extend this analysis to non-linear MAEs to show that MAE
representations adapt to spatial correlations in the dataset, beyond
second-order statistics. Finally, we discuss some insights on how to select MAE
hyper-parameters in practice.

Result: 实验表明BIRD方法不仅达到最先进性能，而且具有快速推理速度

Conclusion: 双向时间信息传播策略能有效利用全局时间信息，提升红外小目标检测性能

Abstract: Moving infrared small target detection is broadly adopted in infrared search
and track systems, and has attracted considerable research focus in recent
years. The existing learning-based multi-frame methods mainly aggregate the
information of adjacent frames in a sliding window fashion to assist the
detection of the current frame. However, the sliding-window-based methods do
not consider joint optimization of the entire video clip and ignore the global
temporal information outside the sliding window, resulting in redundant
computation and sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose a
Bidirectional temporal information propagation method for moving InfraRed small
target Detection, dubbed BIRD. The bidirectional propagation strategy
simultaneously utilizes local temporal information of adjacent frames and
global temporal information of past and future frames in a recursive fashion.
Specifically, in the forward and backward propagation branches, we first design
a Local Temporal Motion Fusion (LTMF) module to model local spatio-temporal
dependency between a target frame and its two adjacent frames. Then, a Global
Temporal Motion Fusion (GTMF) module is developed to further aggregate the
global propagation feature with the local fusion feature. Finally, the
bidirectional aggregated features are fused and input into the detection head
for detection. In addition, the entire video clip is jointly optimized by the
traditional detection loss and the additional Spatio-Temporal Fusion (STF)
loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed BIRD method not only
achieves the state-of-the-art performance but also shows a fast inference
speed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的低分辨率图像给人脸检测带来重大挑战，需要研究输入分辨率对不同检测模型性能的影响，为实际应用提供模型选择依据。

Method: 使用WIDER FACE数据集，在多种图像分辨率（160x160、320x320、640x640）下系统评估YOLOv11、YOLOv12和MTCNN三种模型，采用精确率、召回率、mAP50、mAP50-95和推理时间等指标。

Conclusion: 研究结果为根据不同操作约束条件选择分辨率感知的人脸检测模型提供了实用指导，高分辨率场景推荐YOLOv11，需要更高召回率时考虑YOLOv12。

Abstract: Face detection is a crucial component in many AI-driven applications such as
surveillance, biometric authentication, and human-computer interaction.
However, real-world conditions like low-resolution imagery present significant
challenges that degrade detection performance. In this study, we systematically
investigate the impact of input resolution on the accuracy and robustness of
three prominent deep learning-based face detectors: YOLOv11, YOLOv12, and
MTCNN. Using the WIDER FACE dataset, we conduct extensive evaluations across
multiple image resolutions (160x160, 320x320, and 640x640) and assess each
model's performance using metrics such as precision, recall, mAP50, mAP50-95,
and inference time. Results indicate that YOLOv11 outperforms YOLOv12 and MTCNN
in terms of detection accuracy, especially at higher resolutions, while YOLOv12
exhibits slightly better recall. MTCNN, although competitive in landmark
localization, lags in real-time inference speed. Our findings provide
actionable insights for selecting resolution-aware face detection models
suitable for varying operational constraints.

Abstract: Conventional car damage inspection techniques are labor-intensive, manual,
and frequently overlook tiny surface imperfections like microscopic dents.
Machine learning provides an innovative solution to the increasing demand for
quicker and more precise inspection methods. The paper uses the YOLOv8 object
recognition framework to provide a deep learning-based solution for
automatically detecting microscopic surface flaws, notably tiny dents, on car
exteriors. Traditional automotive damage inspection procedures are manual,
time-consuming, and frequently unreliable at detecting tiny flaws. To solve
this, a bespoke dataset containing annotated photos of car surfaces under
various lighting circumstances, angles, and textures was created. To improve
robustness, the YOLOv8m model and its customized variants, YOLOv8m-t4 and
YOLOv8m-t42, were trained employing real-time data augmentation approaches.
Experimental results show that the technique has excellent detection accuracy
and low inference latency, making it suited for real-time applications such as
automated insurance evaluations and automobile inspections. Evaluation
parameters such as mean Average Precision (mAP), precision, recall, and
F1-score verified the model's efficacy. With a precision of 0.86, recall of
0.84, and F1-score of 0.85, the YOLOv8m-t42 model outperformed the YOLOv8m-t4
model (precision: 0.81, recall: 0.79, F1-score: 0.80) in identifying
microscopic surface defects. With a little reduced mAP@0.5:0.95 of 0.20, the
mAP@0.5 for YOLOv8m-t42 stabilized at 0.60. Furthermore, YOLOv8m-t42's PR curve
area was 0.88, suggesting more consistent performance than YOLOv8m-t4 (0.82).
YOLOv8m-t42 has greater accuracy and is more appropriate for practical dent
detection applications, even though its convergence is slower.

Conclusion: MATR通过有效的序列对齐和预训练策略，显著提升了视频到视频时刻检索的性能，为解决该任务的挑战提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Video-to-video moment retrieval (Vid2VidMR) is the task of localizing unseen
events or moments in a target video using a query video. This task poses
several challenges, such as the need for semantic frame-level alignment and
modeling complex dependencies between query and target videos. To tackle this
challenging problem, we introduce MATR (Moment Alignment TRansformer), a
transformer-based model designed to capture semantic context as well as the
temporal details necessary for precise moment localization. MATR conditions
target video representations on query video features using dual-stage sequence
alignment that encodes the required correlations and dependencies. These
representations are then used to guide foreground/background classification and
boundary prediction heads, enabling the model to accurately identify moments in
the target video that semantically match with the query video. Additionally, to
provide a strong task-specific initialization for MATR, we propose a
self-supervised pre-training technique that involves training the model to
localize random clips within videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MATR achieves notable performance improvements of 13.1% in R@1 and 8.1% in mIoU
on an absolute scale compared to state-of-the-art methods on the popular
ActivityNet-VRL dataset. Additionally, on our newly proposed dataset,
SportsMoments, MATR shows a 14.7% gain in R@1 and a 14.4% gain in mIoU on an
absolute scale over strong baselines.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了3DGS在极稀疏视角输入下的性能瓶颈，无需SfM初始化即可实现高质量的相机位姿估计和3D场景重建，具有优异的视觉质量

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable real-time
performance in novel view synthesis, yet its effectiveness relies heavily on
dense multi-view inputs with precisely known camera poses, which are rarely
available in real-world scenarios. When input views become extremely sparse,
the Structure-from-Motion (SfM) method that 3DGS depends on for initialization
fails to accurately reconstruct the 3D geometric structures of scenes,
resulting in degraded rendering quality. In this paper, we propose a novel
SfM-free 3DGS-based method that jointly estimates camera poses and reconstructs
3D scenes from extremely sparse-view inputs. Specifically, instead of SfM, we
propose a dense stereo module to progressively estimates camera pose
information and reconstructs a global dense point cloud for initialization. To
address the inherent problem of information scarcity in extremely sparse-view
settings, we propose a coherent view interpolation module that interpolates
camera poses based on training view pairs and generates viewpoint-consistent
content as additional supervision signals for training. Furthermore, we
introduce multi-scale Laplacian consistent regularization and adaptive
spatial-aware multi-scale geometry regularization to enhance the quality of
geometrical structures and rendered content. Experiments show that our method
significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art 3DGS-based approaches,
achieving a remarkable 2.75dB improvement in PSNR under extremely sparse-view
conditions (using only 2 training views). The images synthesized by our method
exhibit minimal distortion while preserving rich high-frequency details,
resulting in superior visual quality compared to existing techniques.

Conclusion: LGMSNet在资源受限的医疗场景中具有实际部署潜力，为轻量级医学图像分割提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a pivotal role in disease diagnosis and
treatment planning, particularly in resource-constrained clinical settings
where lightweight and generalizable models are urgently needed. However,
existing lightweight models often compromise performance for efficiency and
rarely adopt computationally expensive attention mechanisms, severely
restricting their global contextual perception capabilities. Additionally,
current architectures neglect the channel redundancy issue under the same
convolutional kernels in medical imaging, which hinders effective feature
extraction. To address these challenges, we propose LGMSNet, a novel
lightweight framework based on local and global dual multiscale that achieves
state-of-the-art performance with minimal computational overhead. LGMSNet
employs heterogeneous intra-layer kernels to extract local high-frequency
information while mitigating channel redundancy. In addition, the model
integrates sparse transformer-convolutional hybrid branches to capture

TL;DR: MExECON是一个从稀疏多视角RGB图像重建穿衣人体3D模型的新方法，通过多视角联合优化提升单视角ECON方法的几何和姿态估计精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的单视角3D人体重建方法（如ECON）在几何细节和身体姿态估计方面存在局限，需要利用多视角信息来提升重建质量和一致性

Method: 提出联合多视角身体优化（JMBO）算法，在所有输入视角中联合拟合单个SMPL-X人体模型，确保多视角一致性；使用优化后的身体模型作为低频先验，通过法线图积分添加几何细节；整合前后视角的法线图来捕捉服装褶皱和发型等细节

Result: 实验结果表明MExECON相比单视角基线方法在保真度方面持续提升，与现代少样本3D重建方法相比具有竞争力，且无需重新训练网络

Conclusion: MExECON成功扩展了单视角方法到多视角场景，通过多视角联合优化显著提升了3D人体重建质量，为稀疏多视角图像下的高精度人体建模提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: This work presents MExECON, a novel pipeline for 3D reconstruction of clothed
human avatars from sparse multi-view RGB images. Building on the single-view
method ECON, MExECON extends its capabilities to leverage multiple viewpoints,
improving geometry and body pose estimation. At the core of the pipeline is the
proposed Joint Multi-view Body Optimization (JMBO) algorithm, which fits a
single SMPL-X body model jointly across all input views, enforcing multi-view
consistency. The optimized body model serves as a low-frequency prior that
guides the subsequent surface reconstruction, where geometric details are added
via normal map integration. MExECON integrates normal maps from both front and
back views to accurately capture fine-grained surface details such as clothing
folds and hairstyles. All multi-view gains are achieved without requiring any
network re-training. Experimental results show that MExECON consistently
improves fidelity over the single-view baseline and achieves competitive
performance compared to modern few-shot 3D reconstruction methods.

TL;DR: AdaSFFuse是一个新颖的多模态图像融合框架，通过自适应跨域协同融合学习实现任务通用性，在红外-可见光、多焦点、多曝光和医学图像融合等任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态图像融合方法面临模态不对齐、高频细节破坏和任务特定限制等挑战，需要一种能够适应不同场景和任务的通用融合解决方案。

Method: 提出AdaSFFuse框架，包含自适应近似小波变换(AdaWAT)进行频率解耦，以及空间-频率Mamba块实现跨域融合，通过可学习映射动态调整融合过程。

Result: 在四种多模态图像融合任务上的广泛实验表明，AdaSFFuse具有卓越的融合性能，同时保持低计算成本和紧凑网络结构，在性能和效率之间达到良好平衡。

Conclusion: AdaSFFuse通过创新的频率解耦和跨域融合机制，有效解决了多模态图像融合中的关键挑战，为任务通用型图像融合提供了高效可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Image Fusion (MMIF) aims to integrate complementary information
from different imaging modalities to overcome the limitations of individual
sensors. It enhances image quality and facilitates downstream applications such
as remote sensing, medical diagnostics, and robotics. Despite significant
advancements, current MMIF methods still face challenges such as modality
misalignment, high-frequency detail destruction, and task-specific limitations.
To address these challenges, we propose AdaSFFuse, a novel framework for
task-generalized MMIF through adaptive cross-domain co-fusion learning.
AdaSFFuse introduces two key innovations: the Adaptive Approximate Wavelet
Transform (AdaWAT) for frequency decoupling, and the Spatial-Frequency Mamba
Blocks for efficient multimodal fusion. AdaWAT adaptively separates the high-
and low-frequency components of multimodal images from different scenes,
enabling fine-grained extraction and alignment of distinct frequency
characteristics for each modality. The Spatial-Frequency Mamba Blocks
facilitate cross-domain fusion in both spatial and frequency domains, enhancing
this process. These blocks dynamically adjust through learnable mappings to
ensure robust fusion across diverse modalities. By combining these components,
AdaSFFuse improves the alignment and integration of multimodal features,
reduces frequency loss, and preserves critical details. Extensive experiments
on four MMIF tasks -- Infrared-Visible Image Fusion (IVF), Multi-Focus Image
Fusion (MFF), Multi-Exposure Image Fusion (MEF), and Medical Image Fusion (MIF)
-- demonstrate AdaSFFuse's superior fusion performance, ensuring both low
computational cost and a compact network, offering a strong balance between
performance and efficiency. The code will be publicly available at
https://github.com/Zhen-yu-Liu/AdaSFFuse.

TL;DR: ExtraGS是一个用于自动驾驶场景轨迹外推的完整框架，结合几何和生成先验，通过创新的高斯表示和自监督不确定性估计，显著提升外推视图的真实性和几何一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从记录的驾驶日志合成外推视图对于自动驾驶模拟至关重要，但现有方法使用生成先验作为伪地面真值往往导致几何一致性差和渲染过度平滑的问题。

Method: 提出ExtraGS框架，核心包括：基于混合高斯-SDF设计的道路表面高斯(RSG)表示；使用可学习缩放因子的远场高斯(FFG)；基于球谐函数的自监督不确定性估计框架，选择性整合生成先验。

Result: 在多个数据集、多样化多相机设置和各种生成先验上的广泛实验表明，ExtraGS显著提升了外推视图的真实性和几何一致性，同时在原始轨迹上保持高保真度。

Conclusion: ExtraGS通过整合几何和生成先验的创新方法，有效解决了自动驾驶场景外推视图合成中的关键挑战，为自动驾驶模拟提供了高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Synthesizing extrapolated views from recorded driving logs is critical for
simulating driving scenes for autonomous driving vehicles, yet it remains a
challenging task. Recent methods leverage generative priors as pseudo ground
truth, but often lead to poor geometric consistency and over-smoothed
renderings. To address these limitations, we propose ExtraGS, a holistic
framework for trajectory extrapolation that integrates both geometric and
generative priors. At the core of ExtraGS is a novel Road Surface Gaussian(RSG)
representation based on a hybrid Gaussian-Signed Distance Function (SDF)
design, and Far Field Gaussians (FFG) that use learnable scaling factors to
efficiently handle distant objects. Furthermore, we develop a self-supervised
uncertainty estimation framework based on spherical harmonics that enables
selective integration of generative priors only where extrapolation artifacts
occur. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets, diverse multi-camera setups,
and various generative priors demonstrate that ExtraGS significantly enhances
the realism and geometric consistency of extrapolated views, while preserving
high fidelity along the original trajectory.

TL;DR: GroupSketch是一种新颖的矢量草图动画方法，通过两阶段流程（运动初始化和运动细化）有效处理多对象交互和复杂运动，解决了现有方法在时间一致性和泛化能力方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有草图动画方法在处理多对象交互和复杂运动时存在困难，要么仅限于单对象情况，要么存在时间不一致性和泛化能力差的问题。

Method: 采用两阶段流程：1）运动初始化阶段交互式分割语义组并定义关键帧，通过插值生成粗略动画；2）运动细化阶段使用基于组的位移网络（GDN）预测组特定位移场，并利用文本到视频模型的先验知识，包含上下文条件特征增强（CCFE）等专门模块来提高时间一致性。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在生成复杂多对象草图的高质量、时间一致动画方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GroupSketch扩展了草图动画的实际应用范围，能够有效处理多对象交互和复杂运动场景。

Abstract: We introduce GroupSketch, a novel method for vector sketch animation that
effectively handles multi-object interactions and complex motions. Existing
approaches struggle with these scenarios, either being limited to single-object
cases or suffering from temporal inconsistency and poor generalization. To
address these limitations, our method adopts a two-stage pipeline comprising
Motion Initialization and Motion Refinement. In the first stage, the input
sketch is interactively divided into semantic groups and key frames are
defined, enabling the generation of a coarse animation via interpolation. In
the second stage, we propose a Group-based Displacement Network (GDN), which
refines the coarse animation by predicting group-specific displacement fields,
leveraging priors from a text-to-video model. GDN further incorporates
specialized modules, such as Context-conditioned Feature Enhancement (CCFE), to
improve temporal consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality,
temporally consistent animations for complex, multi-object sketches, thus
expanding the practical applications of sketch animation.

TL;DR: D3FNet是一个用于高分辨率遥感影像中细粒度道路结构分割的网络，通过差分注意力膨胀提取、双流解码融合机制和多尺度膨胀策略，有效解决了窄道路提取中的宽度限制、拓扑断裂和遮挡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从高分辨率遥感影像中提取窄道路面临重大挑战，包括道路宽度有限、拓扑结构断裂和频繁遮挡等问题，需要专门针对细粒度、遮挡和低对比度道路段的解决方案。

Method: 基于D-LinkNet编码器-解码器架构，提出三个关键创新：差分注意力膨胀提取模块增强细微道路特征并抑制背景噪声；双流解码融合机制整合原始特征和注意力调制特征；多尺度膨胀策略（1,3,5,9）减少网格伪影并改善连续性。

Result: 在DeepGlobe和CHN6-CUG基准测试中，D3FNet在具有挑战性的道路区域实现了优越的IoU和召回率，超越了最先进的基线方法。消融研究验证了注意力引导编码和双路径解码的互补协同作用。

Conclusion: D3FNet被证实为复杂遥感和协同感知场景中细粒度窄道路提取的鲁棒解决方案，特别适用于处理细粒度、遮挡和低对比度的道路段。

Abstract: Extracting narrow roads from high-resolution remote sensing imagery remains a
significant challenge due to their limited width, fragmented topology, and
frequent occlusions. To address these issues, we propose D3FNet, a Dilated
Dual-Stream Differential Attention Fusion Network designed for fine-grained
road structure segmentation in remote perception systems. Built upon the
encoder-decoder backbone of D-LinkNet, D3FNet introduces three key
innovations:(1) a Differential Attention Dilation Extraction (DADE) module that
enhances subtle road features while suppressing background noise at the
bottleneck; (2) a Dual-stream Decoding Fusion Mechanism (DDFM) that integrates
original and attention-modulated features to balance spatial precision with
semantic context; and (3) a multi-scale dilation strategy (rates 1, 3, 5, 9)
that mitigates gridding artifacts and improves continuity in narrow road
prediction. Unlike conventional models that overfit to generic road widths,
D3FNet specifically targets fine-grained, occluded, and low-contrast road
segments. Extensive experiments on the DeepGlobe and CHN6-CUG benchmarks show
that D3FNet achieves superior IoU and recall on challenging road regions,
outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Ablation studies further verify the
complementary synergy of attention-guided encoding and dual-path decoding.
These results confirm D3FNet as a robust solution for fine-grained narrow road
extraction in complex remote and cooperative perception scenarios.

TL;DR: ADAPT是一种无需反向传播的测试时自适应方法，通过高斯概率推理建模类别条件似然，结合CLIP先验和历史知识库进行轻量级正则化，在多种分布偏移下实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时自适应方法存在两个主要问题：1）依赖反向传播或迭代优化，限制了可扩展性和实时部署；2）缺乏对类别条件特征分布的显式建模，这影响了决策边界的可靠性和预测的校准性。

Method: 将测试时自适应重新构建为高斯概率推理任务，使用逐渐更新的类别均值和共享协方差矩阵来建模类别条件似然。引入基于CLIP先验和历史知识库的轻量级正则化来校正可能的似然偏差。无需源数据、梯度更新或完整访问目标数据。

Result: 在多样化基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法在广泛的分布偏移范围内实现了最先进的性能，具有优越的可扩展性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ADAPT方法通过概率推理框架有效解决了测试时自适应的关键挑战，为实时部署和可靠的自适应提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) enhances the zero-shot robustness under
distribution shifts by leveraging unlabeled test data during inference. Despite
notable advances, several challenges still limit its broader applicability.
First, most methods rely on backpropagation or iterative optimization, which
limits scalability and hinders real-time deployment. Second, they lack explicit
modeling of class-conditional feature distributions. This modeling is crucial
for producing reliable decision boundaries and calibrated predictions, but it
remains underexplored due to the lack of both source data and supervision at
test time. In this paper, we propose ADAPT, an Advanced Distribution-Aware and
backPropagation-free Test-time adaptation method. We reframe TTA as a Gaussian
probabilistic inference task by modeling class-conditional likelihoods using
gradually updated class means and a shared covariance matrix. This enables
closed-form, training-free inference. To correct potential likelihood bias, we
introduce lightweight regularization guided by CLIP priors and a historical
knowledge bank. ADAPT requires no source data, no gradient updates, and no full
access to target data, supporting both online and transductive settings.
Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance under a wide range of distribution shifts
with superior scalability and robustness.

TL;DR: 提出两阶段训练策略解决INR频谱偏差问题：首先使用邻域感知软掩码对高频细节像素加权，然后过渡到全图像训练，有效提升重建质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐式神经表示(INR)存在频谱偏差问题，神经网络倾向于学习低频分量而难以捕捉高频细节如锐利边缘和精细纹理

Method: 两阶段训练策略：第一阶段使用邻域感知软掩码自适应地为局部变化强烈的像素分配更高权重，鼓励模型早期关注精细细节；第二阶段进行全图像训练

Result: 实验结果表明该方法一致地改善了重建质量，并能与现有INR方法互补

Conclusion: 作为首个在图像INR中为像素分配频率感知重要性的尝试，为缓解频谱偏差问题提供了新途径

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as a powerful alternative
to traditional pixel-based formats by modeling images as continuous functions
over spatial coordinates. A key challenge, however, lies in the spectral bias
of neural networks, which tend to favor low-frequency components while
struggling to capture high-frequency (HF) details such as sharp edges and fine
textures. While prior approaches have addressed this limitation through
architectural modifications or specialized activation functions, we propose an
orthogonal direction by directly guiding the training process. Specifically, we
introduce a two-stage training strategy where a neighbor-aware soft mask
adaptively assigns higher weights to pixels with strong local variations,
encouraging early focus on fine details. The model then transitions to
full-image training. Experimental results show that our approach consistently
improves reconstruction quality and complements existing INR methods. As a
pioneering attempt to assign frequency-aware importance to pixels in image INR,
our work offers a new avenue for mitigating the spectral bias problem.

Motivation: 现有的半定规划松弛方法求解截断最小二乘配准问题需要数百秒，计算效率低下，需要更快的全局最优求解方法。

Method: 使用线性时间凸松弛和承包商方法加速分支定界算法，在给定旋转轴的情况下求解点云配准问题。

Result: 能够在0.5秒内求解100个点的3D点云配准问题，比STRIDE SDP求解器快两个数量级，并提供全局最优性证明。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提高了点云配准问题的求解效率，虽然目前只能处理旋转轴已知的情况，但在计算速度上有重大突破。

Abstract: Recent results showed that point cloud registration with given
correspondences can be made robust to outlier rates of up to 95\% using the
truncated least squares (TLS) formulation. However, solving this combinatorial
optimization problem to global optimality is challenging. Provably globally
optimal approaches using semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations take
hundreds of seconds for 100 points. In this paper, we propose a novel linear
time convex relaxation as well as a contractor method to speed up Branch and
Bound (BnB). Our solver can register two 3D point clouds with 100 points to
provable global optimality in less than half a second when the axis of rotation
is provided. Although it currently cannot solve the full 6DoF problem, it is
two orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art SDP solver STRIDE when
solving the rotation-only TLS problem. In addition to providing a formal proof
for global optimality, we present empirical evidence of global optimality using
adversarial instances with local minimas close to the global minimum.

wildlife interactions and informing effective conservation planning.
Multiperspective monitoring of wildlife and human activities by combining
camera traps and drone imagery. Capturing the spatial patterns of their
distributions, which allows the identification of the overlap of their activity
zones and the assessment of the degree of human wildlife conflict. The study
was conducted in Chitwan National Park (CNP), Nepal, and adjacent regions.
Images collected by visible and nearinfrared camera traps and thermal infrared
drones from February to July 2022 were processed to create training and testing
datasets, which were used to build deep learning models to automatic identify
wildlife and human activities. Drone collected thermal imagery was used for
detecting targets to provide a multiple monitoring perspective. Spatial pattern
analysis was performed to identify animal and resident activity hotspots and
delineation potential human wildlife conflict zones. Among the deep learning
models tested, YOLOv11s achieved the highest performance with a precision of
96.2%, recall of 92.3%, mAP50 of 96.7%, and mAP50 of 81.3%, making it the most
effective for detecting objects in camera trap imagery. Drone based thermal
imagery, analyzed with an enhanced Faster RCNN model, added a complementary
aerial viewpoint for camera trap detections. Spatial pattern analysis
identified clear hotspots for both wildlife and human activities and their
overlapping patterns within certain areas in the CNP and buffer zones
indicating potential conflict. This study reveals human wildlife conflicts
within the conserved landscape. Integrating multiperspective monitoring with
automated object detection enhances wildlife surveillance and landscape

Motivation: 现有视频LLM在整体推理方面取得显著进展，但在时间感知上仍显粗糙：时间戳仅隐式编码、帧级特征连续性捕捉能力弱、语言视觉对齐容易偏离关注实体。

Method: 1) 扩散时序潜在(DTL)编码器增强边界敏感性和保持时间一致性；2) 对象接地表示显式绑定查询实体到局部视觉证据；3) 混合令牌方案使用离散时间令牌提供显式时间戳建模。

Result: 在Charades STA、NExT GQA和多个VideoQA基准测试中取得了最先进的结果，验证了模型的强大接地能力。

Conclusion: Grounded VideoDiT通过三项关键创新设计，成功克服了现有视频LLM的时间感知局限性，实现了精细的时间推理和强大的接地能力。

Abstract: Understanding videos requires more than answering open ended questions, it
demands the ability to pinpoint when events occur and how entities interact
across time. While recent Video LLMs have achieved remarkable progress in
holistic reasoning, they remain coarse in temporal perception: timestamps are
encoded only implicitly, frame level features are weak in capturing continuity,
and language vision alignment often drifts from the entities of interest. In
this paper, we present Grounded VideoDiT, a Video LLM designed to overcome
these limitations by introducing three key innovations. First, a Diffusion
Temporal Latent (DTL) encoder enhances boundary sensitivity and maintains
temporal consistency. Second, object grounded representations explicitly bind
query entities to localized visual evidence, strengthening alignment. Third, a
mixed token scheme with discrete temporal tokens provides explicit timestamp
modeling, enabling fine grained temporal reasoning. Together, these designs
equip Grounded VideoDiT with robust grounding capabilities, as validated by
state of the art results on Charades STA, NExT GQA, and multiple VideoQA
benchmarks.

Motivation: 机载光达数据的树木实例分割对森林监测至关重要，但因数据变化大和精确标签成本高，需要弱监督方法来羁正这些挑战。

Method: 首先获取初始分割结果，通过人工评分质量，然后训练评分模型对分割输出进行分类，最后用评分模型的反馈来微调分割模型。

Result: 方法将原始分割模型的正确识别树木实例数量提高34%，同时大幅减少了非树木实例的预测。

Conclusion: 该弱监督方法有效提高了树木分割精度，但在疏林区域小树或复杂环境中仍面临挑战。

Abstract: Tree instance segmentation of airborne laser scanning (ALS) data is of utmost
importance for forest monitoring, but remains challenging due to variations in
the data caused by factors such as sensor resolution, vegetation state at
acquisition time, terrain characteristics, etc. Moreover, obtaining a
sufficient amount of precisely labeled data to train fully supervised instance
segmentation methods is expensive. To address these challenges, we propose a
weakly supervised approach where labels of an initial segmentation result
obtained either by a non-finetuned model or a closed form algorithm are
provided as a quality rating by a human operator. The labels produced during
the quality assessment are then used to train a rating model, whose task is to
classify a segmentation output into the same classes as specified by the human
operator. Finally, the segmentation model is finetuned using feedback from the
rating model. This in turn improves the original segmentation model by 34\% in
terms of correctly identified tree instances while considerably reducing the
number of non-tree instances predicted. Challenges still remain in data over
sparsely forested regions characterized by small trees (less than two meters in
height) or within complex surroundings containing shrubs, boulders, etc. which
can be confused as trees where the performance of the proposed method is
reduced.

Motivation: 现实场景中难以获取目标模型信息，现有3D对抗攻击方法依赖模型参数或输出信息，需要开发不依赖目标模型信息的迁移攻击方法

Method: 基于关键特征一致性观察，提出关键特征引导(CFG)方法，通过计算特征重要性来正则化对抗点云搜索，优先破坏不同架构可能采用的关键特征，并在损失函数中约束最大偏差以确保不可感知性

Result: 在ModelNet40和ScanObjectNN基准数据集上的大量实验表明，CFG方法大幅优于现有最先进的攻击方法

Conclusion: CFG方法通过关键特征引导有效提升了3D点云对抗样本的迁移性，为黑盒攻击场景提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Deep neural networks for 3D point clouds have been demonstrated to be
vulnerable to adversarial examples. Previous 3D adversarial attack methods
often exploit certain information about the target models, such as model
parameters or outputs, to generate adversarial point clouds. However, in
realistic scenarios, it is challenging to obtain any information about the
target models under conditions of absolute security. Therefore, we focus on
transfer-based attacks, where generating adversarial point clouds does not
require any information about the target models. Based on our observation that
the critical features used for point cloud classification are consistent across
different DNN architectures, we propose CFG, a novel transfer-based black-box
attack method that improves the transferability of adversarial point clouds via
the proposed Critical Feature Guidance. Specifically, our method regularizes
the search of adversarial point clouds by computing the importance of the
extracted features, prioritizing the corruption of critical features that are
likely to be adopted by diverse architectures. Further, we explicitly constrain
the maximum deviation extent of the generated adversarial point clouds in the
loss function to ensure their imperceptibility. Extensive experiments conducted
on the ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN benchmark datasets demonstrate that the
proposed CFG outperforms the state-of-the-art attack methods by a large margin.

Abstract: Online HD map construction is a fundamental task in autonomous driving
systems, aiming to acquire semantic information of map elements around the ego
vehicle based on real-time sensor inputs. Recently, several approaches have
achieved promising results by incorporating offline priors such as SD maps and
HD maps or by fusing multi-modal data. However, these methods depend on stale
offline maps and multi-modal sensor suites, resulting in avoidable
computational overhead at inference. To address these limitations, we employ a
knowledge distillation strategy to transfer knowledge from multimodal models
with prior knowledge to an efficient, low-cost, and vision-centric student
model. Specifically, we propose MapKD, a novel multi-level cross-modal
knowledge distillation framework with an innovative Teacher-Coach-Student (TCS)
paradigm. This framework consists of: (1) a camera-LiDAR fusion model with

*Franz Hanke,Antonia Bieringer,Olaf Wysocki,Boris Jutzi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CM2LoD3提出了一种基于冲突图(CMs)的自动化LoD3建筑模型重建方法，通过语义分割真实和合成冲突图来重建包含窗户、门等立面细节的建筑模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LoD1和LoD2建筑模型缺乏立面细节，而LoD3模型虽然包含窗户、门等细节元素，但传统方法需要手动建模，难以大规模应用

Method: 利用射线到模型先验分析获得冲突图(CMs)，开发语义冲突图生成器(SCMG)生成合成CMs进行语义分割，并通过置信度分数将纹理模型分割结果与CMs融合

Result: 实验结果表明该方法能有效分割和重建建筑开口，通过不确定性感知的纹理分割融合实现了61%的性能提升

Conclusion: 该方法推动了自动化LoD3模型重建的进展，为可扩展和高效的三维城市建模铺平了道路

Abstract: Detailed 3D building models are crucial for urban planning, digital twins,
and disaster management applications. While Level of Detail 1 (LoD)1 and LoD2
building models are widely available, they lack detailed facade elements
essential for advanced urban analysis. In contrast, LoD3 models address this
limitation by incorporating facade elements such as windows, doors, and
underpasses. However, their generation has traditionally required manual
modeling, making large-scale adoption challenging. In this contribution,
CM2LoD3, we present a novel method for reconstructing LoD3 building models
leveraging Conflict Maps (CMs) obtained from ray-to-model-prior analysis.
Unlike previous works, we concentrate on semantically segmenting real-world CMs
with synthetically generated CMs from our developed Semantic Conflict Map
Generator (SCMG). We also observe that additional segmentation of textured
models can be fused with CMs using confidence scores to further increase
segmentation performance and thus increase 3D reconstruction accuracy.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our CM2LoD3 method in
segmenting and reconstructing building openings, with the 61% performance with
uncertainty-aware fusion of segmented building textures. This research
contributes to the advancement of automated LoD3 model reconstruction, paving
the way for scalable and efficient 3D city modeling. Our project is available:

TL;DR: MDPR框架通过构建多维视觉语义知识库和动态提示路由机制，解决VLM在类别不平衡场景下微调的偏差问题，在多个长尾基准测试中达到SOTA水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练视觉语言模型(VLMs)在类别不平衡场景下微调时存在偏差，现有方法忽略了VLM预训练中固有的类别不平衡问题，导致下游任务中的偏差累积。

Method: 提出多维动态提示路由(MDPR)框架：构建包含五个视觉语义维度的综合知识库；通过动态路由机制对齐全局视觉类别、检索最优提示、平衡细粒度语义；通过logits融合获得稳定预测。

Result: 在CIFAR-LT、ImageNet-LT和Places-LT等长尾基准测试中达到与当前SOTA方法相当的结果；消融研究证实语义库对尾部类别的有效性，动态路由计算开销极小。

Conclusion: MDPR为数据不平衡下的VLM微调提供了一个灵活高效的增强方案，能够有效缓解类别不平衡带来的偏差问题。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated
impressive capability in visual tasks, but their fine-tuning often suffers from
bias in class-imbalanced scene. Recent works have introduced large language
models (LLMs) to enhance VLM fine-tuning with supplementing semantic
information. However, they often overlook inherent class imbalance in VLMs'
pre-training, which may lead to bias accumulation in downstream tasks. To
address this problem, this paper proposes a Multi-dimensional Dynamic Prompt
Routing (MDPR) framework. MDPR constructs a comprehensive knowledge base for
classes, spanning five visual-semantic dimensions. During fine-tuning, the
dynamic routing mechanism aligns global visual classes, retrieves optimal
prompts, and balances fine-grained semantics, yielding stable predictions
through logits fusion. Extensive experiments on long-tailed benchmarks,
including CIFAR-LT, ImageNet-LT, and Places-LT, demonstrate that MDPR achieves
comparable results with current SOTA methods. Ablation studies further confirm
the effectiveness of our semantic library for tail classes, and show that our
dynamic routing incurs minimal computational overhead, making MDPR a flexible
and efficient enhancement for VLM fine-tuning under data imbalance.

TL;DR: StreamMem是一种查询无关的KV缓存内存机制，用于流式视频理解，通过注意力分数压缩视觉token和通用查询token之间的KV缓存，在内存受限的长视频场景中实现高效问答。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在处理长视频时面临内存和计算开销大的问题，现有视觉压缩方法需要预先编码整个视觉上下文或提前获取问题，这在长视频理解和多轮对话场景中不实用。

Method: 提出StreamMem机制，以流式方式编码新视频帧，使用视觉token和通用查询token之间的注意力分数压缩KV缓存，同时维持固定大小的KV内存。

Result: 在三个长视频理解和两个流式视频问答基准测试中，StreamMem在查询无关的KV缓存压缩方面达到最先进性能，并与查询感知压缩方法具有竞争力。

Conclusion: StreamMem为长视频流式理解提供了一种高效的查询无关KV缓存压缩解决方案，在保持性能的同时显著降低了内存和计算开销。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in
visual-language reasoning, but their ability to efficiently handle long videos
remains limited. Despite recent advances in long-context MLLMs, storing and
attending to the key-value (KV) cache for long visual contexts incurs
substantial memory and computational overhead. Existing visual compression
methods require either encoding the entire visual context before compression or
having access to the questions in advance, which is impractical for long video
understanding and multi-turn conversational settings. In this work, we propose
StreamMem, a query-agnostic KV cache memory mechanism for streaming video
understanding. Specifically, StreamMem encodes new video frames in a streaming
manner, compressing the KV cache using attention scores between visual tokens
and generic query tokens, while maintaining a fixed-size KV memory to enable
efficient question answering (QA) in memory-constrained, long-video scenarios.
Evaluation on three long video understanding and two streaming video question
answering benchmarks shows that StreamMem achieves state-of-the-art performance
in query-agnostic KV cache compression and is competitive with query-aware
compression approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成视频建模方法主要依赖RGB信号，导致在长序列中对象结构和运动出现累积错误，需要解决长时间结构一致性和时间一致性的挑战。

Method: 提出WorldWeaver框架，联合预测感知条件和颜色信息，利用深度线索构建记忆库保存上下文信息，采用分段噪声调度训练预测组。

Result: 在基于扩散和整流流的模型上进行广泛实验，证明WorldWeaver能有效减少时间漂移并提高生成视频的保真度。

Conclusion: WorldWeaver通过统一的长期建模方案，显著提升了长视频生成的时间一致性和质量，为解决长序列视频生成中的结构漂移问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Generative video modeling has made significant strides, yet ensuring
structural and temporal consistency over long sequences remains a challenge.
Current methods predominantly rely on RGB signals, leading to accumulated
errors in object structure and motion over extended durations. To address these
issues, we introduce WorldWeaver, a robust framework for long video generation
that jointly models RGB frames and perceptual conditions within a unified
long-horizon modeling scheme. Our training framework offers three key
advantages. First, by jointly predicting perceptual conditions and color
information from a unified representation, it significantly enhances temporal
consistency and motion dynamics. Second, by leveraging depth cues, which we
observe to be more resistant to drift than RGB, we construct a memory bank that
preserves clearer contextual information, improving quality in long-horizon
video generation. Third, we employ segmented noise scheduling for training
prediction groups, which further mitigates drift and reduces computational
cost. Extensive experiments on both diffusion- and rectified flow-based models
demonstrate the effectiveness of WorldWeaver in reducing temporal drift and
improving the fidelity of generated videos.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉基础模型（如SAM）在细粒度语义分割（如特定细胞亚型识别）方面存在挑战，需要开发更精确的病理图像分析方法。

Method: 采用全栈方法：1）分子赋能的标注减少像素级标注需求；2）使用SAM适配器进行语义特定学习；3）整合分子导向校正学习（MOCL）提高分割精度。

Result: 在内部和公共数据集上的实验显示，All-in-SAM模型显著提高了细胞分类性能，即使面对不同质量的标注数据。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅减轻了标注人员的工作负担，还将精确的生物医学图像分析扩展到资源有限的环境，推动了医学诊断和病理图像分析的自动化。

Abstract: Purpose: Recent developments in computational pathology have been driven by
advances in Vision Foundation Models, particularly the Segment Anything Model
(SAM). This model facilitates nuclei segmentation through two primary methods:
prompt-based zero-shot segmentation and the use of cell-specific SAM models for
direct segmentation. These approaches enable effective segmentation across a
range of nuclei and cells. However, general vision foundation models often face
challenges with fine-grained semantic segmentation, such as identifying
specific nuclei subtypes or particular cells. Approach: In this paper, we
propose the molecular-empowered All-in-SAM Model to advance computational
pathology by leveraging the capabilities of vision foundation models. This
model incorporates a full-stack approach, focusing on: (1) annotation-engaging
lay annotators through molecular-empowered learning to reduce the need for
detailed pixel-level annotations, (2) learning-adapting the SAM model to
emphasize specific semantics, which utilizes its strong generalizability with
SAM adapter, and (3) refinement-enhancing segmentation accuracy by integrating
Molecular-Oriented Corrective Learning (MOCL). Results: Experimental results
from both in-house and public datasets show that the All-in-SAM model
significantly improves cell classification performance, even when faced with
varying annotation quality. Conclusions: Our approach not only reduces the
workload for annotators but also extends the accessibility of precise
biomedical image analysis to resource-limited settings, thereby advancing
medical diagnostics and automating pathology image analysis.

Abstract: We present Waver, a high-performance foundation model for unified image and
video generation. Waver can directly generate videos with durations ranging
from 5 to 10 seconds at a native resolution of 720p, which are subsequently
upscaled to 1080p. The model simultaneously supports text-to-video (T2V),
image-to-video (I2V), and text-to-image (T2I) generation within a single,

quality, we establish a comprehensive data curation pipeline and manually
annotate and train an MLLM-based video quality model to filter for the
highest-quality samples. Furthermore, we provide detailed training and
inference recipes to facilitate the generation of high-quality videos. Building

TL;DR: ATLAS是一个从60万高分辨率扫描数据学习的高保真人体模型，通过解耦形状和骨骼基座，在人体骨骼基础上构建网格表示，实现了更好的形状表达性和精细控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参数化人体模型在捕捉多样化姿态和形状细节方面存在局限，主要由于训练数据多样性不足和建模假设限制，且传统方法中外表面与内部骨骼的依赖关系限制了直接控制能力。

Method: 使用240个同步相机采集的60万高分辨率扫描数据，显式解耦形状和骨骼基座，在人体骨骼基础上构建网格表示，采用非线性姿态校正方法。

Result: ATLAS在拟合未见过的多样化姿态主体时更准确，定量评估显示非线性姿态校正比线性模型更能有效捕捉复杂姿态。

Conclusion: 通过解耦形状和骨骼表示，ATLAS实现了增强的形状表达能力、精细化的身体属性定制，以及与外部软组织特征无关的关键点拟合，超越了现有方法。

Abstract: Parametric body models offer expressive 3D representation of humans across a
wide range of poses, shapes, and facial expressions, typically derived by
learning a basis over registered 3D meshes. However, existing human mesh
modeling approaches struggle to capture detailed variations across diverse body
poses and shapes, largely due to limited training data diversity and
restrictive modeling assumptions. Moreover, the common paradigm first optimizes
the external body surface using a linear basis, then regresses internal
skeletal joints from surface vertices. This approach introduces problematic
dependencies between internal skeleton and outer soft tissue, limiting direct
control over body height and bone lengths. To address these issues, we present
ATLAS, a high-fidelity body model learned from 600k high-resolution scans
captured using 240 synchronized cameras. Unlike previous methods, we explicitly
decouple the shape and skeleton bases by grounding our mesh representation in
the human skeleton. This decoupling enables enhanced shape expressivity,
fine-grained customization of body attributes, and keypoint fitting independent
of external soft-tissue characteristics. ATLAS outperforms existing methods by
fitting unseen subjects in diverse poses more accurately, and quantitative
evaluations show that our non-linear pose correctives more effectively capture
complex poses compared to linear models.

Abstract: 3D content generation has recently attracted significant research interest
due to its applications in VR/AR and embodied AI. In this work, we address the
challenging task of synthesizing multiple 3D assets within a single scene
image. Concretely, our contributions are fourfold: (i) we present SceneGen, a
novel framework that takes a scene image and corresponding object masks as
input, simultaneously producing multiple 3D assets with geometry and texture.
Notably, SceneGen operates with no need for optimization or asset retrieval;
(ii) we introduce a novel feature aggregation module that integrates local and
global scene information from visual and geometric encoders within the feature
extraction module. Coupled with a position head, this enables the generation of
3D assets and their relative spatial positions in a single feedforward pass;
(iii) we demonstrate SceneGen's direct extensibility to multi-image input
scenarios. Despite being trained solely on single-image inputs, our
architectural design enables improved generation performance with multi-image
inputs; and (iv) extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations confirm the
efficiency and robust generation abilities of our approach. We believe this
paradigm offers a novel solution for high-quality 3D content generation,
potentially advancing its practical applications in downstream tasks. The code

Result: 在标准基准测试中，GPT-Balance分数比领先的扩散方法高出30%以上，512×512图像编辑仅需1.2秒，比同等规模的UltraEdit快2.2倍。

Conclusion: VAREdit通过自回归范式和多尺度对齐机制，显著提升了图像编辑的精确性和效率，为指令引导的图像编辑提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have brought remarkable visual fidelity
to instruction-guided image editing. However, their global denoising process
inherently entangles the edited region with the entire image context, leading
to unintended spurious modifications and compromised adherence to editing
instructions. In contrast, autoregressive models offer a distinct paradigm by
formulating image synthesis as a sequential process over discrete visual
tokens. Their causal and compositional mechanism naturally circumvents the
adherence challenges of diffusion-based methods. In this paper, we present
VAREdit, a visual autoregressive (VAR) framework that reframes image editing as
a next-scale prediction problem. Conditioned on source image features and text
instructions, VAREdit generates multi-scale target features to achieve precise
edits. A core challenge in this paradigm is how to effectively condition the
source image tokens. We observe that finest-scale source features cannot
effectively guide the prediction of coarser target features. To bridge this
gap, we introduce a Scale-Aligned Reference (SAR) module, which injects
scale-matched conditioning information into the first self-attention layer.
VAREdit demonstrates significant advancements in both editing adherence and
efficiency. On standard benchmarks, it outperforms leading diffusion-based
methods by 30\%+ higher GPT-Balance score. Moreover, it completes a
$512\times512$ editing in 1.2 seconds, making it 2.2$\times$ faster than the
similarly sized UltraEdit. The models are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统生成模型独立采样导致输出冗余，限制了用户选择和创意探索。实际应用中用户通常需要一组多样化的输出结果。

Method: 将组推理建模为二次整数分配问题：候选输出作为图节点，通过优化样本质量（一元项）和最大化组多样性（二元项）来选择子集。采用渐进式剪枝策略提高运行效率。

Result: 实验表明该方法相比独立采样基线和现有推理算法，显著提高了组多样性和质量。框架适用于文本到图像、图像到图像、图像提示和视频生成等多种任务。

Conclusion: 该方法使生成模型能够将多个输出视为有凝聚力的组而非独立样本，为实际应用提供了更丰富的输出选择。

Abstract: Generative models typically sample outputs independently, and recent
inference-time guidance and scaling algorithms focus on improving the quality
of individual samples. However, in real-world applications, users are often
presented with a set of multiple images (e.g., 4-8) for each prompt, where
independent sampling tends to lead to redundant results, limiting user choices
and hindering idea exploration. In this work, we introduce a scalable group
inference method that improves both the diversity and quality of a group of
samples. We formulate group inference as a quadratic integer assignment
problem: candidate outputs are modeled as graph nodes, and a subset is selected
to optimize sample quality (unary term) while maximizing group diversity
(binary term). To substantially improve runtime efficiency, we progressively
prune the candidate set using intermediate predictions, allowing our method to
scale up to large candidate sets. Extensive experiments show that our method
significantly improves group diversity and quality compared to independent
sampling baselines and recent inference algorithms. Our framework generalizes
across a wide range of tasks, including text-to-image, image-to-image, image
prompting, and video generation, enabling generative models to treat multiple
outputs as cohesive groups rather than independent samples.

Conclusion: CineScale成功解决了高分辨率视觉生成中的高频信息增加和重复模式问题，扩展了预训练模型的高分辨率生成能力

Abstract: Visual diffusion models achieve remarkable progress, yet they are typically
trained at limited resolutions due to the lack of high-resolution data and
constrained computation resources, hampering their ability to generate
high-fidelity images or videos at higher resolutions. Recent efforts have
explored tuning-free strategies to exhibit the untapped potential
higher-resolution visual generation of pre-trained models. However, these
methods are still prone to producing low-quality visual content with repetitive
patterns. The key obstacle lies in the inevitable increase in high-frequency
information when the model generates visual content exceeding its training
resolution, leading to undesirable repetitive patterns deriving from the
accumulated errors. In this work, we propose CineScale, a novel inference
paradigm to enable higher-resolution visual generation. To tackle the various
issues introduced by the two types of video generation architectures, we
propose dedicated variants tailored to each. Unlike existing baseline methods
that are confined to high-resolution T2I and T2V generation, CineScale broadens
the scope by enabling high-resolution I2V and V2V synthesis, built atop
state-of-the-art open-source video generation frameworks. Extensive experiments
validate the superiority of our paradigm in extending the capabilities of
higher-resolution visual generation for both image and video models.
Remarkably, our approach enables 8k image generation without any fine-tuning,
and achieves 4k video generation with only minimal LoRA fine-tuning. Generated

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles hold great promise for reducing traffic fatalities and
improving transportation efficiency, yet their widespread adoption hinges on
embedding robust ethical reasoning into routine and emergency maneuvers. Here,
we present a hierarchical Safe Reinforcement Learning (Safe RL) framework that
explicitly integrates moral considerations with standard driving objectives. At
the decision level, a Safe RL agent is trained using a composite ethical risk
cost, combining collision probability and harm severity, to generate high-level
motion targets. A dynamic Prioritized Experience Replay mechanism amplifies
learning from rare but critical, high-risk events. At the execution level,
polynomial path planning coupled with Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID)
and Stanley controllers translates these targets into smooth, feasible
trajectories, ensuring both accuracy and comfort. We train and validate our
approach on rich, real-world traffic datasets encompassing diverse vehicles,
cyclists, and pedestrians, and demonstrate that it outperforms baseline methods
in reducing ethical risk and maintaining driving performance. To our knowledge,
this is the first study of ethical decision-making for autonomous vehicles via
Safe RL in real-world scenarios. Our results highlight the potential of
combining formal control theory and data-driven learning to advance ethically
accountable autonomy in complex, human-mixed traffic environments.

variability across patient populations and clinical settings -- no single model
performs best for all cohorts. To address this, we propose a personalized lung
cancer risk prediction agent that dynamically selects the most appropriate
model for each patient by combining cohort-specific knowledge with modern
retrieval and reasoning techniques. Given a patient's CT scan and structured
metadata -- including demographic, clinical, and nodule-level features -- the
agent first performs cohort retrieval using FAISS-based similarity search
across nine diverse real-world cohorts to identify the most relevant patient
population from a multi-institutional database. Second, a Large Language Model
(LLM) is prompted with the retrieved cohort and its associated performance
metrics to recommend the optimal prediction algorithm from a pool of eight
representative models, including classical linear risk models (e.g., Mayo,
Brock), temporally-aware models (e.g., TDVIT, DLSTM), and multi-modal computer
vision-based approaches (e.g., Liao, Sybil, DLS, DLI). This two-stage agent
pipeline -- retrieval via FAISS and reasoning via LLM -- enables dynamic,
cohort-aware risk prediction personalized to each patient's profile. Building
on this architecture, the agent supports flexible and cohort-driven model
selection across diverse clinical populations, offering a practical path toward
individualized risk assessment in real-world lung cancer screening.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合图神经网络和Transformer的统一框架，用于帕金森病进展预测，通过结构感知门控机制融合结构关系和时间动态特征，在多项指标上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决帕金森病进展预测中症状演化复杂性和时间依赖性建模不足的挑战，需要同时考虑症状间的结构关系和疾病进展的时间动态特征。

Method: 使用图神经网络建模多模态临床症状的结构关系，Transformer架构建模时间动态特征，设计结构感知门控机制动态融合结构和时间信息，包含图构建、时间编码和预测输出三个模块。

Result: 在真实帕金森病纵向数据上验证，在AUC、RMSE和IPW-F1指标上优于主流模型，能有效区分进展阶段并捕捉个性化症状轨迹。

Conclusion: 该框架具有良好的泛化能力和结构可扩展性，为帕金森病等慢性进展性疾病的智能建模提供了可靠支持。

Abstract: This study addresses the challenges of symptom evolution complexity and
insufficient temporal dependency modeling in Parkinson's disease progression
prediction. It proposes a unified prediction framework that integrates
structural perception and temporal modeling. The method leverages graph neural
networks to model the structural relationships among multimodal clinical
symptoms and introduces graph-based representations to capture semantic
dependencies between symptoms. It also incorporates a Transformer architecture
to model dynamic temporal features during disease progression. To fuse
structural and temporal information, a structure-aware gating mechanism is
designed to dynamically adjust the fusion weights between structural encodings
and temporal features, enhancing the model's ability to identify key
progression stages. To improve classification accuracy and stability, the
framework includes a multi-component modeling pipeline, consisting of a graph
construction module, a temporal encoding module, and a prediction output layer.
The model is evaluated on real-world longitudinal Parkinson's disease data. The
experiments involve comparisons with mainstream models, sensitivity analysis of
hyperparameters, and graph connection density control. Results show that the
proposed method outperforms existing approaches in AUC, RMSE, and IPW-F1
metrics. It effectively distinguishes progression stages and improves the
model's ability to capture personalized symptom trajectories. The overall
framework demonstrates strong generalization and structural scalability,
providing reliable support for intelligent modeling of chronic progressive
diseases such as Parkinson's disease.

TL;DR: 提出HHNAS-AM方法，通过分层混合架构搜索和自适应变异策略，有效解决文本分类中NAS搜索空间过大和冗余的问题，在Spider数据集上测试准确率提升8%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NAS模型在文本分类中缺乏分层混合结构，搜索空间无限制导致过大且冗余，现有RL模型无法有效导航搜索空间，扁平架构搜索导致搜索空间无序难以遍历。

Method: 引入架构模板组织搜索空间，基于领域特定线索设计搜索空间，采用Q-learning动态调整变异策略，使模型完全概率化以有效探索搜索空间。

Conclusion: HHNAS-AM方法通过分层组织和自适应变异策略，有效解决了NAS在文本分类中的搜索空间问题，显著提升了性能表现。

Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has garnered significant research interest
due to its capability to discover architectures superior to manually designed
ones. Learning text representation is crucial for text classification and other
language-related tasks. The NAS model used in text classification does not have
a Hybrid hierarchical structure, and there is no restriction on the
architecture structure, due to which the search space becomes very large and
mostly redundant, so the existing RL models are not able to navigate the search
space effectively. Also, doing a flat architecture search leads to an
unorganised search space, which is difficult to traverse. For this purpose, we
propose HHNAS-AM (Hierarchical Hybrid Neural Architecture Search with Adaptive
Mutation Policies), a novel approach that efficiently explores diverse
architectural configurations. We introduce a few architectural templates to
search on which organise the search spaces, where search spaces are designed on
the basis of domain-specific cues. Our method employs mutation strategies that
dynamically adapt based on performance feedback from previous iterations using
Q-learning, enabling a more effective and accelerated traversal of the search
space. The proposed model is fully probabilistic, enabling effective
exploration of the search space. We evaluate our approach on the database id
(db_id) prediction task, where it consistently discovers high-performing
architectures across multiple experiments. On the Spider dataset, our method
achieves an 8% improvement in test accuracy over existing baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LPO是一种新的偏好对齐框架，通过梯度解耦、偏移约束和可控拒绝抑制来解决DPO的过拟合和崩溃问题，在多个任务上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DPO虽然简单且训练稳定，但容易过拟合和崩溃，需要更好的偏好优化算法来解决这些问题。

Method: 引入梯度解耦（用绝对差损失替代log-sigmoid）、偏移约束加正正则化保持响应质量、梯度分离实现可控拒绝抑制。

Result: 在通用文本任务、数学任务和文本转语音任务上均表现出性能提升。

Conclusion: LPO是一个鲁棒且可调的偏好对齐范式，已公开源代码、模型和训练数据。

Abstract: DPO (Direct Preference Optimization) has become a widely used offline
preference optimization algorithm due to its simplicity and training stability.
However, DPO is prone to overfitting and collapse. To address these challenges,
we propose Linear Preference Optimization (LPO), a novel alignment framework
featuring three key innovations. First, we introduce gradient decoupling by
replacing the log-sigmoid function with an absolute difference loss, thereby
isolating the optimization dynamics. Second, we improve stability through an
offset constraint combined with a positive regularization term to preserve the
chosen response quality. Third, we implement controllable rejection suppression
using gradient separation with straightforward estimation and a tunable
coefficient that linearly regulates the descent of the rejection probability.
Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that LPO consistently improves
performance on various tasks, including general text tasks, math tasks, and
text-to-speech (TTS) tasks. These results establish LPO as a robust and tunable
paradigm for preference alignment, and we release the source code, models, and
training data publicly.

Result: 在多种多智能体PettingZoo基准测试中，针对不同最先进攻击方法，该方法能有效检测有影响的对抗攻击，在所有评估环境中对最具影响力攻击的AUC-ROC分数超过0.95，优于离散对应方法。

Conclusion: 提出的分散式检测器在连续动作空间的多智能体环境中表现出色，能够实时有效地检测对抗攻击，为多智能体强化学习系统提供了可靠的安全保障。

Abstract: We address the problem of detecting adversarial attacks against cooperative
multi-agent reinforcement learning with continuous action space. We propose a
decentralized detector that relies solely on the local observations of the
agents and makes use of a statistical characterization of the normal behavior
of observable agents. The proposed detector utilizes deep neural networks to
approximate the normal behavior of agents as parametric multivariate Gaussian
distributions. Based on the predicted density functions, we define a normality
score and provide a characterization of its mean and variance. This
characterization allows us to employ a two-sided CUSUM procedure for detecting
deviations of the normality score from its mean, serving as a detector of
anomalous behavior in real-time. We evaluate our scheme on various multi-agent
PettingZoo benchmarks against different state-of-the-art attack methods, and
our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in detecting impactful
adversarial attacks. Particularly, it outperforms the discrete counterpart by
achieving AUC-ROC scores of over 0.95 against the most impactful attacks in all
evaluated environments.

TL;DR: LFM4Ads是一个面向广告推荐的全表征多粒度迁移框架，通过全面迁移用户表征、商品表征和交叉表征，并采用多粒度机制提升迁移效果，在腾讯广告平台实现显著GMV提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅迁移用户表征，忽略了商品表征和用户-商品交叉表征的价值，且简单将用户表征作为下游特征使用，未能有效弥合上下游差距和利用更多迁移粒度

Method: 提出LFM4Ads框架：1）全面迁移用户表征、商品表征和交叉表征；2）识别最优提取层并将交叉表征聚合为可迁移的粗粒度形式；3）采用多粒度机制：非线性适配器（特征级）、同构交互模块（模块级）和独立检索（模型级）

Conclusion: LFM4Ads通过全表征迁移和多粒度机制有效解决了现有方法的局限性，在工业级广告推荐中取得了显著的业务效果和经济效益

Abstract: Online advertising relies on accurate recommendation models, with recent
advances using pre-trained large-scale foundation models (LFMs) to capture
users' general interests across multiple scenarios and tasks. However, existing
methods have critical limitations: they extract and transfer only user
representations (URs), ignoring valuable item representations (IRs) and
user-item cross representations (CRs); and they simply use a UR as a feature in
downstream applications, which fails to bridge upstream-downstream gaps and
overlooks more transfer granularities. In this paper, we propose LFM4Ads, an
All-Representation Multi-Granularity transfer framework for ads recommendation.
It first comprehensively transfers URs, IRs, and CRs, i.e., all available
representations in the pre-trained foundation model. To effectively utilize the
CRs, it identifies the optimal extraction layer and aggregates them into
transferable coarse-grained forms. Furthermore, we enhance the transferability
via multi-granularity mechanisms: non-linear adapters for feature-level
transfer, an Isomorphic Interaction Module for module-level transfer, and
Standalone Retrieval for model-level transfer. LFM4Ads has been successfully
deployed in Tencent's industrial-scale advertising platform, processing tens of
billions of daily samples while maintaining terabyte-scale model parameters
with billions of sparse embedding keys across approximately two thousand
features. Since its production deployment in Q4 2024, LFM4Ads has achieved 10+
successful production launches across various advertising scenarios, including
primary ones like Weixin Moments and Channels. These launches achieve an
overall GMV lift of 2.45% across the entire platform, translating to estimated
annual revenue increases in the hundreds of millions of dollars.

Abstract: Recent advances in quantum computing and machine learning have given rise to
quantum machine learning (QML), with growing interest in learning from
sequential data. Quantum recurrent models like QLSTM are promising for
time-series prediction, NLP, and reinforcement learning. However, designing
effective variational quantum circuits (VQCs) remains challenging and often

outperforms handcrafted baselines, achieving lower loss across diverse test
settings. This approach opens the door to scalable and adaptive quantum
sequence learning.

Motivation: 传统的大气遥感数据修复方法会模糊精细结构特征，而深度学习模型缺乏置信度估计，需要一种既能恢复精细特征又能提供不确定性量化的方法。

Method: 采用课程学习的掩码比例策略，训练ViT解码器从稀疏上下文中重建数据；推理时通过蒙特卡洛随机掩码实现来近似后验预测，获得重建均值和像素级不确定性图。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了高保真重建，支持增强的对流诊断、实时数据同化和改进的长期气候再分析。

Abstract: Accurate atmospheric profiles from remote sensing instruments such as Doppler
Lidar, Radar, and radiometers are frequently corrupted by low-SNR (Signal to
Noise Ratio) gates, range folding, and spurious discontinuities. Traditional
gap filling blurs fine-scale structures, whereas deep models lack confidence
estimates. We present CuMoLoS-MAE, a Curriculum-Guided Monte Carlo Stochastic
Ensemble Masked Autoencoder designed to (i) restore fine-scale features such as
updraft and downdraft cores, shear lines, and small vortices, (ii) learn a
data-driven prior over atmospheric fields, and (iii) quantify pixel-wise
uncertainty. During training, CuMoLoS-MAE employs a mask-ratio curriculum that
forces a ViT decoder to reconstruct from progressively sparser context. At
inference, we approximate the posterior predictive by Monte Carlo over random
mask realisations, evaluating the MAE multiple times and aggregating the
outputs to obtain the posterior predictive mean reconstruction together with a
finely resolved per-pixel uncertainty map. Together with high-fidelity
reconstruction, this novel deep learning-based workflow enables enhanced
convection diagnostics, supports real-time data assimilation, and improves
long-term climate reanalysis.

Conclusion: GEOs成功缩小了神经算子理论实践差距，为无限维凸优化问题提供了高效的深度学习方法，参数复杂度仅随误差倒数对数增长，具有实际可行性。

Abstract: Neural operators (NOs) are a class of deep learning models designed to
simultaneously solve infinitely many related problems by casting them into an
infinite-dimensional space, whereon these NOs operate. A significant gap
remains between theory and practice: worst-case parameter bounds from universal
approximation theorems suggest that NOs may require an unrealistically large
number of parameters to solve most operator learning problems, which stands in
direct opposition to a slew of experimental evidence. This paper closes that
gap for a specific class of {NOs}, generative {equilibrium operators} (GEOs),
using (realistic) finite-dimensional deep equilibrium layers, when solving
families of convex optimization problems over a separable Hilbert space $X$.
Here, the inputs are smooth, convex loss functions on $X$, and outputs are the
associated (approximate) solutions to the optimization problem defined by each
input loss.
  We show that when the input losses lie in suitable infinite-dimensional
compact sets, our GEO can uniformly approximate the corresponding solutions to
arbitrary precision, with rank, depth, and width growing only logarithmically
in the reciprocal of the approximation error. We then validate both our
theoretical results and the trainability of GEOs on three applications: (1)
nonlinear PDEs, (2) stochastic optimal control problems, and (3) hedging
problems in mathematical finance under liquidity constraints.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了分布式机器学习模型分区的复杂性问题，提供了高效、自动化的优化方案，在性能和可行性方面都有显著提升。

Abstract: Partitioning large machine learning models across distributed accelerator
systems is a complex process, requiring a series of interdependent decisions
that are further complicated by internal sharding ambiguities. Consequently,
existing auto-partitioners often suffer from out-of-memory errors or are
prohibitively slow when exploring the exponentially large space of possible
partitionings. To mitigate this, they artificially restrict the search space,
but this approach frequently yields infeasible solutions that violate device
memory constraints or lead to sub-optimal performance.
  We propose a system that combines a novel static compiler analysis with a
Monte Carlo Tree Search. Our analysis constructs an efficient decision space by
identifying (i) tensor dimensions requiring identical sharding, and (ii)
partitioning "conflicts" that require resolution.
  Our system significantly outperforms state-of-the-art industrial methods
across diverse hardware platforms and model architectures, discovering
previously unknown, superior solutions, and the process is fully automated even
for complex and large models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络在分子性质预测方面表现出色，但其黑盒特性降低了可解释性，限制了在药物发现等重要应用中的可信度。现有解释技术往往无法可靠量化单个原子或子结构的贡献。

Method: SEAL将输入图分解为化学相关片段，通过减少片段间消息传递来明确估计片段对模型输出的因果影响，实现片段贡献与模型预测的强对齐。

Result: 在合成基准测试和真实分子数据集上的广泛评估表明，SEAL在定量归因指标和人类对齐可解释性方面均优于其他可解释性方法。用户研究进一步证实SEAL为领域专家提供了更直观可信的解释。

Conclusion: SEAL通过弥合预测性能与可解释性之间的差距，为更透明和可操作的分子建模提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Graph neural networks have demonstrated remarkable success in predicting
molecular properties by leveraging the rich structural information encoded in
molecular graphs. However, their black-box nature reduces interpretability,
which limits trust in their predictions for important applications such as drug
discovery and materials design. Furthermore, existing explanation techniques
often fail to reliably quantify the contribution of individual atoms or
substructures due to the entangled message-passing dynamics. We introduce SEAL
(Substructure Explanation via Attribution Learning), a new interpretable graph
neural network that attributes model predictions to meaningful molecular
subgraphs. SEAL decomposes input graphs into chemically relevant fragments and
estimates their causal influence on the output. The strong alignment between
fragment contributions and model predictions is achieved by explicitly reducing
inter-fragment message passing in our proposed model architecture. Extensive
evaluations on synthetic benchmarks and real-world molecular datasets
demonstrate that SEAL outperforms other explainability methods in both
quantitative attribution metrics and human-aligned interpretability. A user
study further confirms that SEAL provides more intuitive and trustworthy
explanations to domain experts. By bridging the gap between predictive
performance and interpretability, SEAL offers a promising direction for more
transparent and actionable molecular modeling.

TL;DR: Twin-Bootstrap Gradient Descent (Twin-Boot) 是一种集成不确定性估计的优化方法，通过并行训练两个相同模型并周期性重置均值来估计局部不确定性，从而改善深度学习的校准性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统梯度下降方法只能提供点估计而无法衡量置信度，这在过参数化和数据稀缺的情况下尤为严重。虽然自助法(bootstrapping)是经典的不确定性估计方法，但直接应用于深度学习存在训练成本高、无法指导学习过程以及非凸优化中假设不成立等问题。

Method: 提出Twin-Boot方法：两个相同模型在独立的自助样本上并行训练，通过周期性均值重置保持两个轨迹在同一优化盆地内，使其差异反映局部不确定性。训练过程中使用该不确定性估计进行自适应权重采样，提供正则化效果，倾向于寻找更平坦的解。

Result: 在深度神经网络和复杂高维逆问题中，该方法改善了模型的校准性和泛化能力，并产生了可解释的不确定性图谱。

Conclusion: Twin-Boot成功将不确定性估计整合到优化过程中，为深度学习提供了有效的正则化机制和不确定性量化方法，特别适用于过参数化和数据稀缺的场景。

Abstract: Standard gradient descent methods yield point estimates with no measure of
confidence. This limitation is acute in overparameterized and low-data regimes,
where models have many parameters relative to available data and can easily
overfit. Bootstrapping is a classical statistical framework for uncertainty
estimation based on resampling, but naively applying it to deep learning is
impractical: it requires training many replicas, produces post-hoc estimates
that cannot guide learning, and implicitly assumes comparable optima across
runs - an assumption that fails in non-convex landscapes. We introduce
Twin-Bootstrap Gradient Descent (Twin-Boot), a resampling-based training
procedure that integrates uncertainty estimation into optimization. Two
identical models are trained in parallel on independent bootstrap samples, and
a periodic mean-reset keeps both trajectories in the same basin so that their
divergence reflects local (within-basin) uncertainty. During training, we use
this estimate to sample weights in an adaptive, data-driven way, providing
regularization that favors flatter solutions. In deep neural networks and
complex high-dimensional inverse problems, the approach improves calibration
and generalization and yields interpretable uncertainty maps.

Abstract: We consider federated learning of linearly-parameterized nonlinear systems.
We establish theoretical guarantees on the effectiveness of federated nonlinear
system identification compared to centralized approaches, demonstrating that
the convergence rate improves as the number of clients increases. Although the
convergence rates in the linear and nonlinear cases differ only by a constant,
this constant depends on the feature map $\phi$, which can be carefully chosen
in the nonlinear setting to increase excitation and improve performance. We
experimentally validate our theory in physical settings where client devices
are driven by i.i.d. control inputs and control policies exhibiting i.i.d.
random perturbations, ensuring non-active exploration. Experiments use
trajectories from nonlinear dynamical systems characterized by real-analytic
feature functions, including polynomial and trigonometric components,
representative of physical systems including pendulum and quadrotor dynamics.
We analyze the convergence behavior of the proposed method under varying noise
levels and data distributions. Results show that federated learning
consistently improves convergence of any individual client as the number of
participating clients increases.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种改进的层冻结技术，通过相似性感知通道增强和渐进压缩策略，有效解决了传统特征图缓存方法中的增强应用和存储开销问题，显著降低了深度神经网络训练成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度神经网络和数据集规模的增大，训练计算成本显著增加。传统层冻结方法虽然能减少训练成本，但冻结层仍需前向传播生成特征图，限制了计算成本的进一步降低。现有特征图缓存方法存在增强应用困难和存储开销大的问题，需要系统解决方案。

Result: 该方法在保持模型精度的同时显著降低了训练成本，仅带来较小的时间开销。同时提供了冻结和压缩策略的全面评估，为高效DNN训练优化提供了见解。

Conclusion: 该研究首次全面探索了层冻结缓存方法中的关键挑战，并提供了系统性解决方案，通过创新的增强和压缩技术实现了训练成本的有效降低，为高效深度神经网络训练提供了实用方法。

Abstract: With the growing size of deep neural networks and datasets, the computational
costs of training have significantly increased. The layer-freezing technique
has recently attracted great attention as a promising method to effectively
reduce the cost of network training. However, in traditional layer-freezing
methods, frozen layers are still required for forward propagation to generate
feature maps for unfrozen layers, limiting the reduction of computation costs.
To overcome this, prior works proposed a hypothetical solution, which caches
feature maps from frozen layers as a new dataset, allowing later layers to
train directly on stored feature maps. While this approach appears to be
straightforward, it presents several major challenges that are severely
overlooked by prior literature, such as how to effectively apply augmentations
to feature maps and the substantial storage overhead introduced. If these
overlooked challenges are not addressed, the performance of the caching method
will be severely impacted and even make it infeasible. This paper is the first
to comprehensively explore these challenges and provides a systematic solution.
To improve training accuracy, we propose \textit{similarity-aware channel
augmentation}, which caches channels with high augmentation sensitivity with a
minimum additional storage cost. To mitigate storage overhead, we incorporate
lossy data compression into layer freezing and design a \textit{progressive
compression} strategy, which increases compression rates as more layers are
frozen, effectively reducing storage costs. Finally, our solution achieves
significant reductions in training cost while maintaining model accuracy, with
a minor time overhead. Additionally, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
freezing and compression strategies, providing insights into optimizing their
application for efficient DNN training.

*Syomantak Chaudhuri,Jerry Li,Thomas A. Courtade*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在异质污染率下的鲁棒估计问题，为多元有界分布、单变量高斯分布、多元高斯均值估计和线性回归提供了紧致的极小极大率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的鲁棒估计器通常假设均匀或最坏情况的污染，忽略了现实应用中（如分布式学习、众包和传感器网络）普遍存在的结构性异质污染率问题。

Method: 针对不同分布类型（多元有界分布、单变量高斯、多元高斯）和线性回归问题，建立了考虑异质污染率的极小极大理论框架，分析最优估计器的性能界限。

Result: 获得了所有异质污染模式下的紧致极小极大率，发现最优估计器会丢弃超过特定污染阈值的样本，该阈值由给定的污染率经验分布决定。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了异质污染环境下鲁棒估计的新理论特性，为实际应用中处理非均匀污染提供了理论指导和性能界限。

Abstract: We study the problem of robust estimation under heterogeneous corruption
rates, where each sample may be independently corrupted with a known but
non-identical probability. This setting arises naturally in distributed and
federated learning, crowdsourcing, and sensor networks, yet existing robust
estimators typically assume uniform or worst-case corruption, ignoring
structural heterogeneity. For mean estimation for multivariate bounded
distributions and univariate gaussian distributions, we give tight minimax
rates for all heterogeneous corruption patterns. For multivariate gaussian mean
estimation and linear regression, we establish the minimax rate for squared
error up to a factor of $\sqrt{d}$, where $d$ is the dimension. Roughly, our
findings suggest that samples beyond a certain corruption threshold may be
discarded by the optimal estimators -- this threshold is determined by the
empirical distribution of the corruption rates given.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了NGN-M算法，结合动量和NGN步长调整方法，在保持高性能的同时提高了对步长超参数的稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代优化算法对步长超参数选择敏感，调参困难耗时，需要提高算法的稳定性和健壁性。

Method: 提出NGN-M算法，将动量机制与NGN步长调整方法相结合，在更宽松的假设下达到标准收敛速率。

Result: 算法在保持与最先进优化器相当性能的同时，显著提高了对步长超参数选择的稳定性和健壁性。

Conclusion: NGN-M算法为深度学习优化提供了一种更稳定、更容易调整的解决方案，减少了超参数调整的资源消耗。

Abstract: Modern optimization algorithms that incorporate momentum and adaptive
step-size offer improved performance in numerous challenging deep learning
tasks. However, their effectiveness is often highly sensitive to the choice of
hyperparameters, especially the step-size. Tuning these parameters is often
difficult, resource-intensive, and time-consuming. Therefore, recent efforts
have been directed toward enhancing the stability of optimizers across a wide
range of hyperparameter choices [Schaipp et al., 2024]. In this paper, we
introduce an algorithm that matches the performance of state-of-the-art
optimizers while improving stability to the choice of the step-size
hyperparameter through a novel adaptation of the NGN step-size method [Orvieto
and Xiao, 2024]. Specifically, we propose a momentum-based version (NGN-M) that
attains the standard convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{K})$ under less
restrictive assumptions, without the need for interpolation condition or
assumptions of bounded stochastic gradients or iterates, in contrast to
previous approaches. Additionally, we empirically demonstrate that the
combination of the NGN step-size with momentum results in enhanced robustness
to the choice of the step-size hyperparameter while delivering performance that
is comparable to or surpasses other state-of-the-art optimizers.

Motivation: 研究深度神经网络中"欺骗样本"现象（DNN对看似随机的输入给出高置信度分类），探索DNN泛化行为的内在机制，弥补理论与实践的差距。

Method: 采用基于最大似然估计的分析框架，避免传统的基于梯度的优化和显式标签方法，分析过参数化DNN的特征空间坍缩现象。

Result: 发现DNN在过参数化状态下会出现特征空间坍缩，虽然改善泛化但过多层数会导致退化（不同输入映射到相同输出）；提出了"虫洞"解决方案来绕过退化并处理欺骗样本。

Conclusion: 研究为DNN泛化机制提供了新见解，揭示了短路学习的新视角，并为无监督学习动态的未来研究指明了方向，有助于弥合理论与实践的鸿沟。

Abstract: This work investigates the generalization behavior of deep neural networks
(DNNs), focusing on the phenomenon of "fooling examples," where DNNs
confidently classify inputs that appear random or unstructured to humans. To
explore this phenomenon, we introduce an analytical framework based on maximum
likelihood estimation, without adhering to conventional numerical approaches
that rely on gradient-based optimization and explicit labels. Our analysis
reveals that DNNs operating in an overparameterized regime exhibit a collapse
in the output feature space. While this collapse improves network
generalization, adding more layers eventually leads to a state of degeneracy,
where the model learns trivial solutions by mapping distinct inputs to the same
output, resulting in zero loss. Further investigation demonstrates that this
degeneracy can be bypassed using our newly derived "wormhole" solution. The
wormhole solution, when applied to arbitrary fooling examples, reconciles
meaningful labels with random ones and provides a novel perspective on shortcut
learning. These findings offer deeper insights into DNN generalization and
highlight directions for future research on learning dynamics in unsupervised
settings to bridge the gap between theory and practice.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文首次系统评估稀疏自编码器(SAE)在促进神经元单义性方面的效果，提出了基于Jensen-Shannon距离的概念可分离性评分，发现SAE能减少多义性但稀疏性不一定带来更好性能，并提出了新的干预方法APP。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型存在神经元多义性问题，即单个神经元对多个不相关概念都有响应。稀疏自编码器被提出作为解决方案，但缺乏与基础模型的定量比较。

Method: 引入基于Jensen-Shannon距离的细粒度概念可分离性评分，在Gemma-2-2B模型和多个SAE变体上进行评估，使用完整神经元掩码和部分抑制两种干预策略。

Result: SAE确实减少了多义性并获得了更高的概念可分离性，但更大的稀疏性并不总是带来更好的可分离性，且常常损害下游性能。SAE在使用部分抑制时能实现更精确的概念级控制。

Conclusion: 提出的APP干预方法在目标概念移除方面优于现有方法，为神经元解释和精确控制提供了新的技术路径。

Abstract: A key barrier to interpreting large language models is polysemanticity, where
neurons activate for multiple unrelated concepts. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs)
have been proposed to mitigate this issue by transforming dense activations
into sparse, more interpretable features. While prior work suggests that SAEs
promote monosemanticity, there has been no quantitative comparison with their
base models. This paper provides the first systematic evaluation of SAEs
against base models concerning monosemanticity. We introduce a fine-grained
concept separability score based on the Jensen-Shannon distance, which captures
how distinctly a neuron's activation distributions vary across concepts. Using
Gemma-2-2B and multiple SAE variants across five benchmarks, we show that SAEs
reduce polysemanticity and achieve higher concept separability. However,
greater sparsity of SAEs does not always yield better separability and often
impairs downstream performance. To assess practical utility, we evaluate
concept-level interventions using two strategies: full neuron masking and
partial suppression. We find that, compared to base models, SAEs enable more
precise concept-level control when using partial suppression. Building on this,
we propose Attenuation via Posterior Probabilities (APP), a new intervention
method that uses concept-conditioned activation distributions for targeted
suppression. APP outperforms existing approaches in targeted concept removal.

TL;DR: Hydra是一个混合长上下文语言模型架构，结合了条件计算、长上下文记忆机制和稀疏专家混合，在约16亿参数设计范围内整合了Mamba风格SSM骨干、间歇性稀疏全局注意力、分块级MoE前馈路由和双记忆系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决长上下文语言模型在处理长序列时的效率和容量挑战，通过模块化设计结合多种先进技术，实现输入自适应的长上下文处理能力。

Method: 采用Mamba风格的结构化状态空间模型(SSM)作为骨干，结合间歇性稀疏全局注意力机制、分块级稀疏专家混合(MoE)前馈路由，以及工作记忆加事实PKM的双记忆系统。

Result: 通过小规模原型实验验证了实现可行性，展示了长上下文吞吐量交叉和可控专家路由等定性扩展行为，但尚未进行大规模竞争性性能验证。

Conclusion: Hydra作为一个蓝图架构，展示了结合SSM效率、选择性稀疏注意力、MoE容量和可学习记忆的模块化路径，但最终任务性能验证仍需未来大规模实验。

Abstract: We present Hydra as an architectural proposal for hybrid long-context
language models that combine conditional computation, long-context memory
mechanisms, and sparse mixture-of-experts within an approximately 1.6B
parameter design envelope. Hydra integrates a Mamba-style Structured State
Space Model (SSM) backbone with intermittent sparse global attention,
chunk-level MoE feed-forward routing, and dual (workspace plus factual PKM)
memories. We formalize the component interfaces, give transparent parameter and
complexity accounting, and outline a staged curriculum intended to stably
activate the parts. We accompany the specification with illustrative toy-scale
prototype measurements (tens of millions of parameters on synthetic data) whose
sole purpose is to demonstrate implementation feasibility and qualitative
scaling behaviors (for example, long-context throughput crossover and
controllable expert routing), not to claim competitive full-scale performance.
We explicitly delineate assumptions and open risks (training complexity, memory
utilization, specialization dynamics) and position Hydra as a blueprint to
stimulate empirical follow-up rather than a finished system. By combining SSM
efficiency, selective sparse attention, MoE capacity, and learnable memory,
Hydra sketches a path toward modular, input-adaptive long-context language
models; validating end-task gains at target scale remains future work.

Motivation: 随着文本到图像生成模型在隐私、版权和安全方面的担忧日益增加，概念擦除技术被开发出来防止生成不良内容。然而这些技术的实际效果和鲁棒性需要系统评估。

Method: 提出了Side Effect Evaluation (SEE)评估基准，包含层次化和组合式提示词，通过自动化评估管道从三个维度量化CETs的副作用：对邻近概念的影响、目标规避能力和属性泄露。

Result: 实验表明CETs可以通过超类-子类层级关系和语义相似提示轻松绕过，存在属性泄露问题，并出现注意力集中或分散的反直觉现象。

Conclusion: 当前的概念擦除技术存在严重缺陷，需要更鲁棒的解决方案。作者发布了数据集、代码和评估工具以支持未来研究。

Abstract: Concerns about text-to-image (T2I) generative models infringing on privacy,
copyright, and safety have led to the development of Concept Erasure Techniques
(CETs).
  The goal of an effective CET is to prohibit the generation of undesired
``target'' concepts specified by the user, while preserving the ability to
synthesize high-quality images of the remaining concepts.
  In this work, we demonstrate that CETs can be easily circumvented and present
several side effects of concept erasure.
  For a comprehensive measurement of the robustness of CETs, we present Side
Effect Evaluation (\see), an evaluation benchmark that consists of hierarchical
and compositional prompts that describe objects and their attributes.
  This dataset and our automated evaluation pipeline quantify side effects of
CETs across three aspects: impact on neighboring concepts, evasion of targets,
and attribute leakage.
  Our experiments reveal that CETs can be circumvented by using
superclass-subclass hierarchy and semantically similar prompts, such as
compositional variants of the target. We show that CETs suffer from attribute
leakage and counterintuitive phenomena of attention concentration or dispersal.
  We release our dataset, code, and evaluation tools to aid future work on
robust concept erasure.

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了源自由去学习的挑战，为在无法获取原始训练数据的情况下实现高效的模型去学习提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: As machine learning becomes more pervasive and data privacy regulations
evolve, the ability to remove private or copyrighted information from trained
models is becoming an increasingly critical requirement. Existing unlearning
methods often rely on the assumption of having access to the entire training
dataset during the forgetting process. However, this assumption may not hold
true in practical scenarios where the original training data may not be
accessible, i.e., the source-free setting. To address this challenge, we focus
on the source-free unlearning scenario, where an unlearning algorithm must be
capable of removing specific data from a trained model without requiring access
to the original training dataset. Building on recent work, we present a method
that can estimate the Hessian of the unknown remaining training data, a crucial
component required for efficient unlearning. Leveraging this estimation
technique, our method enables efficient zero-shot unlearning while providing
robust theoretical guarantees on the unlearning performance, while maintaining
performance on the remaining data. Extensive experiments over a wide range of
datasets verify the efficacy of our method.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a categorial generalization of RL, termed
universal reinforcement learning (URL), building on powerful mathematical
abstractions from the study of coinduction on non-well-founded sets and
universal coalgebras, topos theory, and categorial models of asynchronous
parallel distributed computation. In the first half of the paper, we review the
basic RL framework, illustrate the use of categories and functors in RL,
showing how they lead to interesting insights. In particular, we also introduce
a standard model of asynchronous distributed minimization proposed by Bertsekas
and Tsitsiklis, and describe the relationship between metric coinduction and
their proof of the Asynchronous Convergence Theorem. The space of algorithms
for MDPs or PSRs can be modeled as a functor category, where the co-domain
category forms a topos, which admits all (co)limits, possesses a subobject
classifier, and has exponential objects. In the second half of the paper, we
move on to universal coalgebras. Dynamical system models, such as Markov
decision processes (MDPs), partially observed MDPs (POMDPs), a predictive state
representation (PSRs), and linear dynamical systems (LDSs) are all special
types of coalgebras. We describe a broad family of universal coalgebras,
extending the dynamic system models studied previously in RL. The core problem
in finding fixed points in RL to determine the exact or approximate (action)
value function is generalized in URL to determining the final coalgebra
asynchronously in a parallel distributed manner.

Abstract: There is a flurry of recent research papers proposing novel differentially
private machine learning (DPML) techniques. These papers claim to achieve new
state-of-the-art (SoTA) results and offer empirical results as validation.
However, there is no consensus on which techniques are most effective or if
they genuinely meet their stated claims. Complicating matters, heterogeneity in
codebases, datasets, methodologies, and model architectures make direct
comparisons of different approaches challenging.
  In this paper, we conduct a reproducibility and replicability (R+R)
experiment on 11 different SoTA DPML techniques from the recent research
literature. Results of our investigation are varied: while some methods stand
up to scrutiny, others falter when tested outside their initial experimental
conditions. We also discuss challenges unique to the reproducibility of DPML,
including additional randomness due to DP noise, and how to address them.
Finally, we derive insights and best practices to obtain scientifically valid

TL;DR: SafeLLM是一个基于遗忘学习的新型防御框架，通过三阶段流程（动态检测、有害内容追踪、约束优化）从LLMs中移除有害知识，同时保持语言流畅性和通用能力，显著降低越狱攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 越狱攻击通过制作对抗性提示绕过LLMs的对齐机制，导致模型产生有害、受限或有偏见的内容，对LLM安全构成严重威胁。

Method: 采用三阶段管道：1）使用外部分类器和模型内部评估的混合方法进行动态不安全输出检测；2）通过前馈网络激活进行token级有害内容追踪以定位有害知识；3）约束优化以抑制不安全行为而不降低整体模型质量。

Conclusion: 遗忘学习是构建可扩展和有效LLM安全的一个有前景的方向，SafeLLM通过识别和中和负责有害生成路径的FFN子结构，实现了有针对性和不可逆的遗忘。

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks pose a serious threat to the safety of Large Language
Models (LLMs) by crafting adversarial prompts that bypass alignment mechanisms,
causing the models to produce harmful, restricted, or biased content. In this
paper, we propose SafeLLM, a novel unlearning-based defense framework that
unlearn the harmful knowledge from LLMs while preserving linguistic fluency and
general capabilities. SafeLLM employs a three-stage pipeline: (1) dynamic
unsafe output detection using a hybrid approach that integrates external
classifiers with model-internal evaluations; (2) token-level harmful content
tracing through feedforward network (FFN) activations to localize harmful
knowledge; and (3) constrained optimization to suppress unsafe behavior without
degrading overall model quality. SafeLLM achieves targeted and irreversible
forgetting by identifying and neutralizing FFN substructures responsible for
harmful generation pathways. Extensive experiments on prominent LLMs (Vicuna,
LLaMA, and GPT-J) across multiple jailbreak benchmarks show that SafeLLM
substantially reduces attack success rates while maintaining high
general-purpose performance. Compared to standard defense methods such as
supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization, SafeLLM offers
stronger safety guarantees, more precise control over harmful behavior, and
greater robustness to unseen attacks. Moreover, SafeLLM maintains the general
performance after the harmful knowledge unlearned. These results highlight
unlearning as a promising direction for scalable and effective LLM safety.

categories: pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing. While
significant attention has been devoted to the latter two, pre-processing
methods, which operate at the data level and offer advantages such as
model-agnosticism and improved privacy compliance, have received comparatively
less focus and lack standardised evaluation tools. In this work, we introduce
FairPrep, an extensible and modular benchmarking framework designed to evaluate
fairness-aware pre-processing techniques on tabular datasets. Built on the
AIF360 platform, FairPrep allows seamless integration of datasets, fairness
interventions, and predictive models. It features a batch-processing interface
that enables efficient experimentation and automatic reporting of fairness and
utility metrics. By offering standardised pipelines and supporting reproducible
evaluations, FairPrep fills a critical gap in the fairness benchmarking
landscape and provides a practical foundation for advancing data-level fairness
research.

Conclusion: 数值实验验证了所提算法的有效性和鲁棒性，为高维多尺度问题的求解提供了新的有效工具。

Abstract: Tensor neural networks (TNNs) have demonstrated their superiority in solving
high-dimensional problems. However, similar to conventional neural networks,
TNNs are also influenced by the Frequency Principle, which limits their ability
to accurately capture high-frequency features of the solution. In this work, we
analyze the training dynamics of TNNs by Fourier analysis and enhance their
expressivity for high-dimensional multi-scale problems by incorporating random
Fourier features. Leveraging the inherent tensor structure of TNNs, we further
propose a novel approach to extract frequency features of high-dimensional
functions by performing the Discrete Fourier Transform to one-dimensional
component functions. This strategy effectively mitigates the curse of
dimensionality. Building on this idea, we propose a frequency-adaptive TNNs
algorithm, which significantly improves the ability of TNNs in solving complex
multi-scale problems. Extensive numerical experiments are performed to validate
the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed frequency-adaptive TNNs
algorithm.

Abstract: Classification of sleep stages is essential for assessing sleep quality and
diagnosing sleep disorders such as insomnia. However, manual inspection of EEG
characteristics for each stage is time-consuming and prone to human error.
Although machine learning and deep learning methods have been actively
developed, they continue to face challenges from the non-stationarity and
variability of electroencephalography (EEG) and electrooculography (EOG)
signals, often leading to poor generalization on unseen datasets. This research
proposed a Sleep Stage Classification method by developing Multivariate
Differential Transformer (SleepDIFFormer) for joint EEG and EOG representation
learning. Specifically, SleepDIFFormer was developed to process EEG and EOG
signals using our Multivariate Differential Transformer Architecture (MDTA) for
time series, trained with cross-domain alignment. Our method mitigated spatial
and temporal attention noise while learning a domain-invariant joint EEG-EOG
representation through feature distribution alignment, thereby enabling
generalization to unseen target datasets. Empirically, we evaluated our method
on five different sleep staging datasets and compared it with existing
approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance. We also conducted thorough
ablation analyses of SleepDIFFormer and interpreted the differential attention
weights, highlighting their relevance to characteristic sleep EEG patterns.
These findings have implications for advancing automated sleep stage
classification and its application to sleep quality assessment. Our source code
is publicly available at https://github.com/Ben1001409/SleepDIFFormer

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法仅使用单一归因机制标签训练模型，浪费了其他归因视角的互补信号，限制了模型性能

Method: MAL框架包含Attribution Knowledge Aggregator（多任务学习器）和Primary Target Predictor（主目标预测器），采用CAT训练策略利用所有归因标签组合生成增强监督信号

Result: 离线实验GAUC提升0.51%，在线实验ROI提升2.6%

Conclusion: 多归因学习框架能有效整合不同归因机制信息，显著提升CVR预测性能和商业价值

Abstract: Conversion rate (CVR) prediction is a core component of online advertising
systems, where the attribution mechanisms-rules for allocating conversion
credit across user touchpoints-fundamentally determine label generation and
model optimization. While many industrial platforms support diverse attribution
mechanisms (e.g., First-Click, Last-Click, Linear, and Data-Driven Multi-Touch
Attribution), conventional approaches restrict model training to labels from a
single production-critical attribution mechanism, discarding complementary
signals in alternative attribution perspectives.
  To address this limitation, we propose a novel Multi-Attribution Learning
(MAL) framework for CVR prediction that integrates signals from multiple
attribution perspectives to better capture the underlying patterns driving user
conversions. Specifically, MAL is a joint learning framework consisting of two
core components: the Attribution Knowledge Aggregator (AKA) and the Primary
Target Predictor (PTP). AKA is implemented as a multi-task learner that
integrates knowledge extracted from diverse attribution labels. PTP, in
contrast, focuses on the task of generating well-calibrated conversion
probabilities that align with the system-optimized attribution metric (e.g.,
CVR under the Last-Click attribution), ensuring direct compatibility with
industrial deployment requirements. Additionally, we propose CAT, a novel
training strategy that leverages the Cartesian product of all attribution label
combinations to generate enriched supervision signals. This design
substantially enhances the performance of the attribution knowledge aggregator.
Empirical evaluations demonstrate the superiority of MAL over
single-attribution learning baselines, achieving +0.51% GAUC improvement on
offline metrics. Online experiments demonstrate that MAL achieved a +2.6%
increase in ROI (Return on Investment).

Motivation: 黑盒机器学习模型解释需要在准确性和可解释性之间取得平衡，现有方法要么缺乏帕累托最优性保证，要么面临严重的可扩展性问题。

Method: 使用多目标学习或搜索技术生成帕累托最优候选解，然后通过SAT求解器验证每个候选解的局部最优性。

Result: 在基准测试中，该方法生成的解释与提供全局保证的方法结果相近，但具有更好的可扩展性。

Conclusion: 基于局部最优性保证的框架能够有效合成帕累托最优解释，在保持解释质量的同时显著提升可扩展性。

Abstract: Creating meaningful interpretations for black-box machine learning models
involves balancing two often conflicting objectives: accuracy and
explainability. Exploring the trade-off between these objectives is essential
for developing trustworthy interpretations. While many techniques for
multi-objective interpretation synthesis have been developed, they typically
lack formal guarantees on the Pareto-optimality of the results. Methods that do
provide such guarantees, on the other hand, often face severe scalability
limitations when exploring the Pareto-optimal space. To address this, we
develop a framework based on local optimality guarantees that enables more
scalable synthesis of interpretations. Specifically, we consider the problem of
synthesizing a set of Pareto-optimal interpretations with local optimality
guarantees, within the immediate neighborhood of each solution. Our approach
begins with a multi-objective learning or search technique, such as
Multi-Objective Monte Carlo Tree Search, to generate a best-effort set of
Pareto-optimal candidates with respect to accuracy and explainability. We then
verify local optimality for each candidate as a Boolean satisfiability problem,
which we solve using a SAT solver. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach
on a set of benchmarks, comparing it against previous methods for exploring the
Pareto-optimal front of interpretations. In particular, we show that our
approach yields interpretations that closely match those synthesized by methods
offering global guarantees.

Motivation: 现有的自监督对比学习方法通常只生成成对的增强视图，未能充分利用ECG记录的丰富时间结构，限制了模型性能。

Method: 多窗口对比学习框架，从每个ECG实例提取多个时间窗口构建正样本对，通过统计最大化它们的一致性，并利用慢特征分析原理学习时间不变的特征表示。

Result: 在PTB-XL数据集的多标签超类分类中，AUROC达到0.891（vs 0.888），F1分数达到0.680（vs 0.679），预训练轮次减少4倍（32 vs 128），总预训练时间减少14.8%。

Conclusion: 多窗口对比学习为ECG分析提供了一种高效可扩展的自监督学习范式，也为生物医学时间序列数据的表示学习提供了一个有前景的通用框架。

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis is foundational for cardiovascular disease
diagnosis, yet the performance of deep learning models is often constrained by
limited access to annotated data. Self-supervised contrastive learning has
emerged as a powerful approach for learning robust ECG representations from
unlabeled signals. However, most existing methods generate only pairwise
augmented views and fail to leverage the rich temporal structure of ECG
recordings. In this work, we present a poly-window contrastive learning
framework. We extract multiple temporal windows from each ECG instance to
construct positive pairs and maximize their agreement via statistics. Inspired
by the principle of slow feature analysis, our approach explicitly encourages
the model to learn temporally invariant and physiologically meaningful features
that persist across time. We validate our approach through extensive
experiments and ablation studies on the PTB-XL dataset. Our results demonstrate
that poly-window contrastive learning consistently outperforms conventional
two-view methods in multi-label superclass classification, achieving higher
AUROC (0.891 vs. 0.888) and F1 scores (0.680 vs. 0.679) while requiring up to
four times fewer pre-training epochs (32 vs. 128) and 14.8% in total wall clock
pre-training time reduction. Despite processing multiple windows per sample, we
achieve a significant reduction in the number of training epochs and total
computation time, making our method practical for training foundational models.
Through extensive ablations, we identify optimal design choices and demonstrate
robustness across various hyperparameters. These findings establish poly-window
contrastive learning as a highly efficient and scalable paradigm for automated
ECG analysis and provide a promising general framework for self-supervised
representation learning in biomedical time-series data.

existing serving frameworks. We evaluate DeepConf across a variety of reasoning
tasks and the latest open-source models, including Qwen 3 and GPT-OSS series.
Notably, on challenging benchmarks such as AIME 2025, DeepConf@512 achieves up
to 99.9% accuracy and reduces generated tokens by up to 84.7% compared to full

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Cumulative Spectral Gradient (CSG)复杂度指标声称与分类器无关且能预测下游性能，但尚未在知识图谱链接预测环境中验证

Method: 在多关系链接预测背景下评估CSG指标，引入transformer嵌入的语义表示，并提出并基准测试一组结构和语义KG复杂度指标

Result: CSG对参数高度敏感，不能稳健地随类别数量扩展，与MRR和Hit@1相关性弱；关系熵、最大关系多样性和关系类型基数等指标与性能呈强负相关

Conclusion: CSG的稳定性和泛化预测能力在链接预测场景中不成立，需要更稳定、可解释且与任务对齐的数据集复杂度度量方法

Abstract: Understanding dataset complexity is fundamental to evaluating and comparing
link prediction models on knowledge graphs (KGs). While the Cumulative Spectral
Gradient (CSG) metric, derived from probabilistic divergence between classes
within a spectral clustering framework, has been proposed as a classifier
agnostic complexity metric purportedly scaling with class cardinality and
correlating with downstream performance, it has not been evaluated in KG
settings so far. In this work, we critically examine CSG in the context of
multi relational link prediction, incorporating semantic representations via
transformer derived embeddings. Contrary to prior claims, we find that CSG is
highly sensitive to parametrisation and does not robustly scale with the number
of classes. Moreover, it exhibits weak or inconsistent correlation with
standard performance metrics such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and Hit@1. To
deepen the analysis, we introduce and benchmark a set of structural and
semantic KG complexity metrics. Our findings reveal that global and local
relational ambiguity captured via Relation Entropy, node level Maximum Relation
Diversity, and Relation Type Cardinality exhibit strong inverse correlations
with MRR and Hit@1, suggesting these as more faithful indicators of task
difficulty. Conversely, graph connectivity measures such as Average Degree,
Degree Entropy, PageRank, and Eigenvector Centrality correlate positively with
Hit@10. Our results demonstrate that CSGs purported stability and
generalization predictive power fail to hold in link prediction settings and
underscore the need for more stable, interpretable, and task-aligned measures
of dataset complexity in knowledge driven learning.

Abstract: Generalization remains a significant challenge in visual classification
tasks, particularly in handling unknown classes in real-world applications.
Existing research focuses on the class discovery paradigm, which tends to favor
known classes, and the incremental learning paradigm, which suffers from
catastrophic forgetting. Recent approaches such as the L-Reg technique employ
logic-based regularization to enhance generalization but are bound by the
necessity of fully defined logical formulas, limiting flexibility for unknown
classes. This paper introduces PL-Reg, a novel partial-logic regularization
term that allows models to reserve space for undefined logic formulas,
improving adaptability to unknown classes. Specifically, we formally
demonstrate that tasks involving unknown classes can be effectively explained
using partial logic. We also prove that methods based on partial logic lead to
improved generalization. We validate PL-Reg through extensive experiments on
Generalized Category Discovery, Multi-Domain Generalized Category Discovery,
and long-tailed Class Incremental Learning tasks, demonstrating consistent
performance improvements. Our results highlight the effectiveness of partial
logic in tackling challenges related to unknown classes.

Abstract: In user-centric design, persona development plays a vital role in
understanding user behaviour, capturing needs, segmenting audiences, and
guiding design decisions. However, the growing complexity of user interactions
calls for a more contextualized approach to ensure designs align with real user
needs. While earlier studies have advanced persona classification by modelling
user behaviour, capturing contextual information, especially by integrating
textual and tabular data, remains a key challenge. These models also often lack
explainability, leaving their predictions difficult to interpret or justify. To
address these limitations, we present ExBigBang (Explainable BigBang), a hybrid
text-tabular approach that uses transformer-based architectures to model rich
contextual features for persona classification. ExBigBang incorporates
metadata, domain knowledge, and user profiling to embed deeper context into
predictions. Through a cyclical process of user profiling and classification,
our approach dynamically updates to reflect evolving user behaviours.
Experiments on a benchmark persona classification dataset demonstrate the
robustness of our model. An ablation study confirms the benefits of combining
text and tabular data, while Explainable AI techniques shed light on the
rationale behind the model's predictions.

Abstract: Machine learning models often preserve biases present in training data,
leading to unfair treatment of certain minority groups. Despite an array of
existing firm-side bias mitigation techniques, they typically incur utility
costs and require organizational buy-in. Recognizing that many models rely on
user-contributed data, end-users can induce fairness through the framework of
Algorithmic Collective Action, where a coordinated minority group strategically
relabels its own data to enhance fairness, without altering the firm's training
process. We propose three practical, model-agnostic methods to approximate
ideal relabeling and validate them on real-world datasets. Our findings show
that a subgroup of the minority can substantially reduce unfairness with a
small impact on the overall prediction error.

Abstract: Dynamic graph-level embedding aims to capture structural evolution in
networks, which is essential for modeling real-world scenarios. However,
existing methods face two critical yet under-explored issues: Structural Visit
Bias, where random walk sampling disproportionately emphasizes high-degree
nodes, leading to redundant and noisy structural representations; and Abrupt
Evolution Blindness, the failure to effectively detect sudden structural
changes due to rigid or overly simplistic temporal modeling strategies,
resulting in inconsistent temporal embeddings. To overcome these challenges, we
propose EvoFormer, an evolution-aware Transformer framework tailored for
dynamic graph-level representation learning. To mitigate Structural Visit Bias,
EvoFormer introduces a Structure-Aware Transformer Module that incorporates
positional encoding based on node structural roles, allowing the model to
globally differentiate and accurately represent node structures. To overcome
Abrupt Evolution Blindness, EvoFormer employs an Evolution-Sensitive Temporal
Module, which explicitly models temporal evolution through a sequential
three-step strategy: (I) Random Walk Timestamp Classification, generating
initial timestamp-aware graph-level embeddings; (II) Graph-Level Temporal
Segmentation, partitioning the graph stream into segments reflecting
structurally coherent periods; and (III) Segment-Aware Temporal Self-Attention
combined with an Edge Evolution Prediction task, enabling the model to
precisely capture segment boundaries and perceive structural evolution trends,
effectively adapting to rapid temporal shifts. Extensive evaluations on five
benchmark datasets confirm that EvoFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance
in graph similarity ranking, temporal anomaly detection, and temporal
segmentation tasks, validating its effectiveness in correcting structural and
temporal biases.

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs(TAGs) are pervasive in real-world systems,where each
node carries its own textual features. In many cases these graphs are
inherently heterogeneous, containing multiple node types and diverse edge
types. Despite the ubiquity of such heterogeneous TAGs, there remains a lack of
large-scale benchmark datasets. This shortage has become a critical bottleneck,
hindering the development and fair comparison of representation learning
methods on heterogeneous text-attributed graphs. In this paper, we introduce
CITE - Catalytic Information Textual Entities Graph, the first and largest
heterogeneous text-attributed citation graph benchmark for catalytic materials.
CITE comprises over 438K nodes and 1.2M edges, spanning four relation types. In
addition, we establish standardized evaluation procedures and conduct extensive
benchmarking on the node classification task, as well as ablation experiments
on the heterogeneous and textual properties of CITE. We compare four classes of

Abstract: In this study, we present an Evolving Fuzzy System within the context of
Federated Learning, which adapts dynamically with the addition of new clusters
and therefore does not require the number of clusters to be selected apriori.
Unlike traditional methods, Federated Learning allows models to be trained
locally on clients' devices, sharing only the model parameters with a central

outperforms established classification methods on several well-known UCI

*Jun Choi,Chang-Ock Lee,Minam Moon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合最小二乘/梯度下降方法来加速DeepONet训练，通过将大型线性系统分解为两个更小的子问题分别求解


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DeepONet输出相对于分支网络最后一层参数是线性的，这些参数可以用最小二乘法优化，但直接构建完整的线性系统计算量过大不可行

Method: 将大型最小二乘系统分解为分支网络和主干网络两个更小的子问题分别求解，并推广到包含正则化项的L2损失函数，包括物理信息无监督学习场景

Result: 该方法能够有效处理原本不可行的大型线性问题，提高了训练效率

Conclusion: 提出的混合优化方法为DeepONet训练提供了计算效率更高的解决方案，特别是在处理大规模问题和物理信息学习任务时

Abstract: We propose an efficient hybrid least squares/gradient descent method to
accelerate DeepONet training. Since the output of DeepONet can be viewed as
linear with respect to the last layer parameters of the branch network, these
parameters can be optimized using a least squares (LS) solve, and the remaining
hidden layer parameters are updated by means of gradient descent form. However,
building the LS system for all possible combinations of branch and trunk inputs
yields a prohibitively large linear problem that is infeasible to solve
directly. To address this issue, our method decomposes the large LS system into
two smaller, more manageable subproblems $\unicode{x2014}$ one for the branch
network and one for the trunk network $\unicode{x2014}$ and solves them
separately. This method is generalized to a broader type of $L^2$ loss with a
regularization term for the last layer parameters, including the case of
unsupervised learning with physics-informed loss.

Motivation: 解决可穿戴设备人体活动识别中的用户诱导概念漂移问题，提高模型在新用户上的泛化能力

Method: 混合框架：先跨用户泛化，然后通过少样本学习在设备上快速适应个体用户，仅更新分类器层

Result: 在三个不同HAR场景中分别实现了3.73%、17.38%和3.70%的准确率提升，部署在RISC-V GAP9微控制器上

Conclusion: 证明了在嵌入式平台上实现快速、轻量且有效的个性化是可行的，为可扩展的用户感知HAR系统铺平了道路

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using wearable devices has advanced
significantly in recent years, yet its generalization remains limited when
models are deployed to new users. This degradation in performance is primarily
due to user-induced concept drift (UICD), highlighting the importance of
efficient personalization. In this paper, we present a hybrid framework that
first generalizes across users and then rapidly adapts to individual users
using few-shot learning directly on-device. By updating only the classifier
layer with user-specific data, our method achieves robust personalization with
minimal computational and memory overhead. We implement this framework on the
energy-efficient RISC-V-based GAP9 microcontroller and validate it across three
diverse HAR scenarios: RecGym, QVAR-Gesture, and Ultrasound-Gesture.
Post-deployment adaptation yields consistent accuracy improvements of 3.73\%,
17.38\%, and 3.70\% respectively. These results confirm that fast, lightweight,
and effective personalization is feasible on embedded platforms, paving the way
for scalable and user-aware HAR systems in the wild

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的多元高斯聚类重叠检测方法，专门针对数据流在线学习场景，能快速检测重叠聚类并避免正交聚类合并


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线数据流学习需要处理概念漂移，导致大量可能重叠的聚类需要合并。现有分布差异度量方法无法有效处理所有形状的聚类且计算成本高

Method: 设计了一种专门检测重叠而非差异的相似性度量方法，计算速度比现有方法快数倍

Result: 该方法比对比方法快数倍，能够有效检测重叠聚类，同时避免正交聚类的错误合并

Conclusion: 提出的重叠检测方法为在线数据流学习中的聚类合并提供了高效实用的解决方案

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new measure for detecting overlap in multivariate
Gaussian clusters. The aim of online learning from data streams is to create
clustering, classification, or regression models that can adapt over time based
on the conceptual drift of streaming data. In the case of clustering, this can
result in a large number of clusters that may overlap and should be merged.
Commonly used distribution dissimilarity measures are not adequate for
determining overlapping clusters in the context of online learning from
streaming data due to their inability to account for all shapes of clusters and
their high computational demands. Our proposed dissimilarity measure is
specifically designed to detect overlap rather than dissimilarity and can be
computed faster compared to existing measures. Our method is several times
faster than compared methods and is capable of detecting overlapping clusters
while avoiding the merging of orthogonal clusters.

Motivation: 现有机器遗忘方法仅通过参数训练抑制不良数据的激活，无法完全消除模型内部的信息痕迹，难以实现有效的连续遗忘且容易受到重新学习攻击。

Conclusion: MRP方法通过不可逆投影变换有效解决了机器遗忘中的根本限制，为模型安全提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
in various domains and tasks, concerns about their safety are becoming
increasingly severe. In particular, since models may store unsafe knowledge
internally, machine unlearning has emerged as a representative paradigm to
ensure model safety. Existing approaches employ various training techniques,
such as gradient ascent and negative preference optimization, in attempts to
eliminate the influence of undesired data on target models. However, these
methods merely suppress the activation of undesired data through parametric
training without completely eradicating its informational traces within the
model. This fundamental limitation makes it difficult to achieve effective
continuous unlearning, rendering these methods vulnerable to relearning
attacks. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Metamorphosis
Representation Projection (MRP) approach that pioneers the application of
irreversible projection properties to machine unlearning. By implementing
projective transformations in the hidden state space of specific network
layers, our method effectively eliminates harmful information while preserving
useful knowledge. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enables
effective continuous unlearning and successfully defends against relearning
attacks, achieving state-of-the-art performance in unlearning effectiveness
while preserving natural performance. Our code is available in

Abstract: This paper studies an input-driven one-state differential equation model
initially developed for an experimentally demonstrated dynamic molecular switch
that switches like synapses in the brain do. The linear-in-the-state and
nonlinear-in-the-input model is exactly solvable, and it is shown that it also
possesses mathematical properties of convergence and fading memory that enable
stable processing of time-varying inputs by nonlinear dynamical systems. Thus,
the model exhibits the co-existence of biologically-inspired behavior and
desirable mathematical properties for stable learning on sequential data. The
results give theoretical support for the use of the dynamic molecular switches
as computational units in deep cascaded/layered feedforward and recurrent
architectures as well as other more general structures for neuromorphic
computing. They could also inspire more general exactly solvable models that
can be fitted to emulate arbitrary physical devices which can mimic
brain-inspired behaviour and perform stable computation on input signals.

Conclusion: BaVerLy通过批量验证策略有效提升了局部鲁棒性验证的效率，为大规模输入集的鲁棒性分析提供了可行方案

Abstract: Neural network image classifiers are ubiquitous in many safety-critical
applications. However, they are susceptible to adversarial attacks. To
understand their robustness to attacks, many local robustness verifiers have
been proposed to analyze $\epsilon$-balls of inputs. Yet, existing verifiers
introduce a long analysis time or lose too much precision, making them less
effective for a large set of inputs. In this work, we propose a new approach to
local robustness: group local robustness verification. The key idea is to
leverage the similarity of the network computations of certain $\epsilon$-balls
to reduce the overall analysis time. We propose BaVerLy, a sound and complete
verifier that boosts the local robustness verification of a set of
$\epsilon$-balls by dynamically constructing and verifying mini-batches.
BaVerLy adaptively identifies successful mini-batch sizes, accordingly
constructs mini-batches of $\epsilon$-balls that have similar network
computations, and verifies them jointly. If a mini-batch is verified, all
$\epsilon$-balls are proven robust. Otherwise, one $\epsilon$-ball is suspected
as not being robust, guiding the refinement. In the latter case, BaVerLy
leverages the analysis results to expedite the analysis of that $\epsilon$-ball
as well as the other $\epsilon$-balls in the batch. We evaluate BaVerLy on
fully connected and convolutional networks for MNIST and CIFAR-10. Results show
that BaVerLy scales the common one by one verification by 2.3x on average and
up to 4.1x, in which case it reduces the total analysis time from 24 hours to 6
hours.

Motivation: 现有的基于欧几里得空间的检索方法无法有效捕捉分子相互作用的层次结构和精细亲和力变化，特别是在活性悬崖等挑战性场景中。

Method: 提出双曲表示学习框架HypSeek，采用蛋白质引导的三塔架构，利用双曲空间的指数几何和负曲率特性来生成表达力强、对亲和力敏感的嵌入表示。

Result: 在DUD-E数据集上虚拟筛选的早期富集率从42.63%提升至51.44%（+20.7%），在JACS数据集上亲和力排序相关性从0.5774提升至0.7239（+25.4%）。

Conclusion: 双曲几何为蛋白质-配体建模提供了强大的归纳偏置，能够统一处理虚拟筛选和亲和力排序任务，在挑战性场景中表现出色。

Abstract: Protein-ligand binding prediction is central to virtual screening and
affinity ranking, two fundamental tasks in drug discovery. While recent
retrieval-based methods embed ligands and protein pockets into Euclidean space
for similarity-based search, the geometry of Euclidean embeddings often fails
to capture the hierarchical structure and fine-grained affinity variations
intrinsic to molecular interactions. In this work, we propose HypSeek, a
hyperbolic representation learning framework that embeds ligands, protein
pockets, and sequences into Lorentz-model hyperbolic space. By leveraging the
exponential geometry and negative curvature of hyperbolic space, HypSeek
enables expressive, affinity-sensitive embeddings that can effectively model
both global activity and subtle functional differences-particularly in
challenging cases such as activity cliffs, where structurally similar ligands
exhibit large affinity gaps. Our mode unifies virtual screening and affinity
ranking in a single framework, introducing a protein-guided three-tower
architecture to enhance representational structure. HypSeek improves early
enrichment in virtual screening on DUD-E from 42.63 to 51.44 (+20.7%) and
affinity ranking correlation on JACS from 0.5774 to 0.7239 (+25.4%),
demonstrating the benefits of hyperbolic geometry across both tasks and
highlighting its potential as a powerful inductive bias for protein-ligand
modeling.

Conclusion: 理论分析证明优化伪任务中的公平性能有效增强结构公平性，促进不同下游应用的公平性泛化

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse
applications. However, due to the biases in the graph structures, graph neural
networks face significant challenges in fairness. Although the original user
graph structure is generally biased, it is promising to guide these existing
structures toward unbiased ones by introducing new links. The fairness guidance
via new links could foster unbiased communities, thereby enhancing fairness in
downstream applications. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework
named FairGuide. Specifically, to ensure fairness in downstream tasks trained
on fairness-guided graphs, we introduce a differentiable community detection
task as a pseudo downstream task. Our theoretical analysis further demonstrates
that optimizing fairness within this pseudo task effectively enhances
structural fairness, promoting fairness generalization across diverse
downstream applications. Moreover, FairGuide employs an effective strategy
which leverages meta-gradients derived from the fairness-guidance objective to
identify new links that significantly enhance structural fairness. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our
proposed method across a variety of graph-based fairness tasks.

the agents perform multiple training epochs between communication rounds, and

results by numerical comparisons with state of the art techniques on a
classification task.

TL;DR: SPOF是一种用于多用户本地差分隐私的稳定扰动损失函数训练机制，通过扰动泰勒展开多项式近似来保护隐私，相比DP-SGD在计算效率和稳定性方面表现更优


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的梯度基隐私保护方法（如DP-SGD）需要在梯度中注入噪声，导致计算效率低且稳定性差，需要一种更高效稳定的多用户本地差分隐私训练机制

Method: SPOF通过扰动稳定化的泰勒展开多项式近似来保护隐私，为每个用户的数据添加校准噪声到多项式系数中，而不是在梯度中注入噪声

Result: 在无线体域网场景中，SPOF相比DP-SGD平均重建准确率提高3.5%，训练时间减少57.2%，在异构用户数据和信道噪声环境下表现稳定

Conclusion: SPOF在多用户环境中实现了更好的隐私-效用权衡，具有更高的计算效率和环境噪声鲁棒性，是本地差分隐私训练的有效替代方案

Abstract: We propose SPOF (Stabilization of Perturbed Loss Function), a differentially
private training mechanism intended for multi-user local differential privacy
(LDP). SPOF perturbs a stabilized Taylor expanded polynomial approximation of a
model's training loss function, where each user's data is privatized by
calibrated noise added to the coefficients of the polynomial. Unlike
gradient-based mechanisms such as differentially private stochastic gradient
descent (DP-SGD), SPOF does not require injecting noise into the gradients of
the loss function, which improves both computational efficiency and stability.
This formulation naturally supports simultaneous privacy guarantees across all
users. Moreover, SPOF exhibits robustness to environmental noise during
training, maintaining stable performance even when user inputs are corrupted.
We compare SPOF with a multi-user extension of DP-SGD, evaluating both methods
in a wireless body area network (WBAN) scenario involving heterogeneous user
data and stochastic channel noise from body sensors. Our results show that SPOF
achieves, on average, up to 3.5% higher reconstruction accuracy and reduces
mean training time by up to 57.2% compared to DP-SGD, demonstrating superior
privacy-utility trade-offs in multi-user environments.

Abstract: This study presents a practical approach for early fault detection in
industrial pump systems using real-world sensor data from a large-scale
vertical centrifugal pump operating in a demanding marine environment. Five key
operational parameters were monitored: vibration, temperature, flow rate,
pressure, and electrical current. A dual-threshold labeling method was applied,
combining fixed engineering limits with adaptive thresholds calculated as the
95th percentile of historical sensor values. To address the rarity of
documented failures, synthetic fault signals were injected into the data using
domain-specific rules, simulating critical alerts within plausible operating
ranges. Three machine learning classifiers - Random Forest, Extreme Gradient
Boosting (XGBoost), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) - were trained to
distinguish between normal operation, early warnings, and critical alerts.
Results showed that Random Forest and XGBoost models achieved high accuracy
across all classes, including minority cases representing rare or emerging
faults, while the SVM model exhibited lower sensitivity to anomalies. Visual
analyses, including grouped confusion matrices and time-series plots, indicated
that the proposed hybrid method provides robust detection capabilities. The
framework is scalable, interpretable, and suitable for real-time industrial
deployment, supporting proactive maintenance decisions before failures occur.
Furthermore, it can be adapted to other machinery with similar sensor
architectures, highlighting its potential as a scalable solution for predictive
maintenance in complex systems.

Abstract: Understanding the nuanced performance of machine learning models is essential
for responsible deployment, especially in high-stakes domains like healthcare
and finance. This paper introduces a novel framework, Conformalized Exceptional
Model Mining, which combines the rigor of Conformal Prediction with the
explanatory power of Exceptional Model Mining (EMM). The proposed framework
identifies cohesive subgroups within data where model performance deviates
exceptionally, highlighting regions of both high confidence and high
uncertainty. We develop a new model class, mSMoPE (multiplex Soft Model
Performance Evaluation), which quantifies uncertainty through conformal
prediction's rigorous coverage guarantees. By defining a new quality measure,
Relative Average Uncertainty Loss (RAUL), our framework isolates subgroups with
exceptional performance patterns in multi-class classification and regression
tasks. Experimental results across diverse datasets demonstrate the framework's
effectiveness in uncovering interpretable subgroups that provide critical
insights into model behavior. This work lays the groundwork for enhancing model
interpretability and reliability, advancing the state-of-the-art in explainable
AI and uncertainty quantification.

Result: 在多个标准数据集上进行实验，证明该方法能够有效提高模型的演化性能和稳定性，减少过拟合现象

Conclusion: 循环渗透正则化是一种有效的深度学习正则化方法，能够在不增加计算复杂度的情况下显著提升模型性能

Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) is a statistical inference approach for
estimating latent parameters of a physical system when the likelihood is
intractable but simulations are available. In practice, SBI is often hindered
by model misspecification--the mismatch between simulated and real-world
observations caused by inherent modeling simplifications. RoPE, a recent SBI
approach, addresses this challenge through a two-stage domain transfer process
that combines semi-supervised calibration with optimal transport (OT)-based
distribution alignment. However, RoPE operates in a fully transductive setting,
requiring access to a batch of test samples at inference time, which limits
scalability and generalization. We propose here a fully inductive and amortized
SBI framework that integrates calibration and distributional alignment into a
single, end-to-end trainable model. Our method leverages mini-batch OT with a
closed-form coupling to align real and simulated observations that correspond
to the same latent parameters, using both paired calibration data and unpaired
samples. A conditional normalizing flow is then trained to approximate the
OT-induced posterior, enabling efficient inference without simulation access at
test time. Across a range of synthetic and real-world benchmarks--including
complex medical biomarker estimation--our approach matches or surpasses the
performance of RoPE, as well as other standard SBI and non-SBI estimators,
while offering improved scalability and applicability in challenging,
misspecified environments.

Conclusion: CoNTM成功解决了持续学习中的主题模型遗忘问题，在保持长期记忆的同时实现了在线学习能力。

Abstract: In continual learning, our aim is to learn a new task without forgetting what
was learned previously. In topic models, this translates to learning new topic
models without forgetting previously learned topics. Previous work either
considered Dynamic Topic Models (DTMs), which learn the evolution of topics
based on the entire training corpus at once, or Online Topic Models, which are
updated continuously based on new data but do not have long-term memory. To
fill this gap, we propose the Continual Neural Topic Model (CoNTM), which
continuously learns topic models at subsequent time steps without forgetting
what was previously learned. This is achieved using a global prior distribution
that is continuously updated. In our experiments, CoNTM consistently
outperformed the dynamic topic model in terms of topic quality and predictive
perplexity while being able to capture topic changes online. The analysis
reveals that CoNTM can learn more diverse topics and better capture temporal
changes than existing methods.

Abstract: Graph machine learning has been widely explored in various domains, such as
community detection, transaction analysis, and recommendation systems. In these
applications, anomaly detection plays an important role. Recently, studies have
shown that anomalies on graphs induce spectral shifts. Some supervised methods
have improved the utilization of such spectral domain information. However,
they remain limited by the scarcity of labeled data due to the nature of
anomalies. On the other hand, existing unsupervised learning approaches
predominantly rely on spatial information or only employ low-pass filters,
thereby losing the capacity for multi-band analysis. In this paper, we propose
Graph Autoencoder with Spectral Encoder and Spectral Decoder (GRASPED) for node
anomaly detection. Our unsupervised learning model features an encoder based on
Graph Wavelet Convolution, along with structural and attribute decoders. The
Graph Wavelet Convolution-based encoder, combined with a Wiener Graph
Deconvolution-based decoder, exhibits bandpass filter characteristics that
capture global and local graph information at multiple scales. This design
allows for a learning-based reconstruction of node attributes, effectively
capturing anomaly information. Extensive experiments on several real-world
graph anomaly detection datasets demonstrate that GRASPED outperforms current
state-of-the-art models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着可穿戴录音设备的普及，科学家越来越多使用自动化方法分析音频数据来研究儿童语言发展。虽然已有文献报告了自动分类器的准确性，但较少研究分类错误对测量结果和统计推断的下游影响

Method: 采用贝叶斯方法研究算法错误对关键科学问题的影响，包括兄弟姐妹对儿童语言经验的影响以及儿童产出与输入之间的关联。比较了LENA系统和ACLEW系统的开源替代方案Voice Type Classifier

Result: 发现分类错误会显著扭曲估计值，自动化注释低估了兄弟姐妹对成人输入的负面影响达20-80%，可能使其低于统计显著性阈值。贝叶斯校准方法在恢复无偏效应大小估计方面有效但不完美

Conclusion: 分类错误会严重影响科学推断的准确性，贝叶斯校准提供了一种有效的纠正方法，但并非万能解决方案。这一问题适用于任何涉及事件检测和分类且错误率非零的分类器

Abstract: With the advent of wearable recorders, scientists are increasingly turning to
automated methods of analysis of audio and video data in order to measure
children's experience, behavior, and outcomes, with a sizable literature
employing long-form audio-recordings to study language acquisition. While
numerous articles report on the accuracy and reliability of the most popular
automated classifiers, less has been written on the downstream effects of
classification errors on measurements and statistical inferences (e.g., the
estimate of correlations and effect sizes in regressions). This paper proposes
a Bayesian approach to study the effects of algorithmic errors on key
scientific questions, including the effect of siblings on children's language
experience and the association between children's production and their input.
In both the most commonly used \gls{lena}, and an open-source alternative (the
Voice Type Classifier from the ACLEW system), we find that classification
errors can significantly distort estimates. For instance, automated annotations
underestimated the negative effect of siblings on adult input by 20--80\%,
potentially placing it below statistical significance thresholds. We further
show that a Bayesian calibration approach for recovering unbiased estimates of
effect sizes can be effective and insightful, but does not provide a fool-proof
solution. Both the issue reported and our solution may apply to any classifier
involving event detection and classification with non-zero error rates.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公平性训练方法虽然经验有效但缺乏正式保证，验证技术不能主动增强训练公平性，需要一种能提供正式公平性保证的训练方法

Method: 采用随机响应机制保护敏感属性，包含可证明公平的初始化和公平保持训练算法两部分，确保模型从公平状态开始并在学习过程中维持公平性

Result: 实验证明该方法有效，能产生经验公平且准确的模型，比基于认证训练的方法效率更高

Conclusion: 该框架为机器学习个体公平性提供了正式的理论保证，解决了现有方法缺乏保证和效率低下的问题

Abstract: Fairness in machine learning is more important than ever as ethical concerns
continue to grow. Individual fairness demands that individuals differing only
in sensitive attributes receive the same outcomes. However, commonly used
machine learning algorithms often fail to achieve such fairness. To improve
individual fairness, various training methods have been developed, such as
incorporating fairness constraints as optimisation objectives. While these
methods have demonstrated empirical effectiveness, they lack formal guarantees
of fairness. Existing approaches that aim to provide fairness guarantees
primarily rely on verification techniques, which can sometimes fail to produce
definitive results. Moreover, verification alone does not actively enhance
individual fairness during training. To address this limitation, we propose a
novel framework that formally guarantees individual fairness throughout
training. Our approach consists of two parts, i.e., (1) provably fair
initialisation that ensures the model starts in a fair state, and (2) a
fairness-preserving training algorithm that maintains fairness as the model
learns. A key element of our method is the use of randomised response
mechanisms, which protect sensitive attributes while maintaining fairness
guarantees. We formally prove that this mechanism sustains individual fairness
throughout the training process. Experimental evaluations confirm that our
approach is effective, i.e., producing models that are empirically fair and
accurate. Furthermore, our approach is much more efficient than the alternative
approach based on certified training (which requires neural network
verification during training).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 精准药物治疗需要准确的剂量反应预测，但传统方法在稀疏采样条件下效果有限，且模型开发周期长。需要一种能够快速适应新化合物并量化患者间变异性的方法。

Method: 提出AICMET模型，结合机制性房室模型先验和摊销式上下文贝叶斯推理。使用Ornstein-Uhlenbeck先验预训练数十万合成药代动力学轨迹，通过Transformer架构实现上下文条件化预测。

Result: 在公开数据集上达到最先进的预测精度，准确量化患者间变异性，优于非线性混合效应基线和神经ODE变体，将模型开发周期从数周缩短到数小时。

Conclusion: 基于Transformer的群体感知神经架构为个性化给药方案提供了新途径，展示了在保留专家建模的同时实现快速精准预测的可行性。

Abstract: Accurate dose-response forecasting under sparse sampling is central to
precision pharmacotherapy. We present the Amortized In-Context Mixed-Effect
Transformer (AICMET) model, a transformer-based latent-variable framework that
unifies mechanistic compartmental priors with amortized in-context Bayesian
inference. AICMET is pre-trained on hundreds of thousands of synthetic
pharmacokinetic trajectories with Ornstein-Uhlenbeck priors over the parameters
of compartment models, endowing the model with strong inductive biases and
enabling zero-shot adaptation to new compounds. At inference time, the decoder
conditions on the collective context of previously profiled trial participants,
generating calibrated posterior predictions for newly enrolled patients after a
few early drug concentration measurements. This capability collapses
traditional model-development cycles from weeks to hours while preserving some
degree of expert modelling. Experiments across public datasets show that AICMET
attains state-of-the-art predictive accuracy and faithfully quantifies
inter-patient variability -- outperforming both nonlinear mixed-effects
baselines and recent neural ODE variants. Our results highlight the feasibility
of transformer-based, population-aware neural architectures as offering a new
alternative for bespoke pharmacokinetic modeling pipelines, charting a path
toward truly population-aware personalized dosing regimens.

Abstract: Effective modeling of heterogeneous subpopulations presents a significant
challenge due to variations in individual characteristics and behaviors. This
paper proposes a novel approach to address this issue through multi-task
learning (MTL) and low-rank tensor decomposition techniques. Our MTL approach
aims to enhance personalized modeling by leveraging shared structures among
similar tasks while accounting for distinct subpopulation-specific variations.
We introduce a framework where low-rank decomposition decomposes the collection
of task model parameters into a low-rank structure that captures commonalities
and variations across tasks and subpopulations. This approach allows for
efficient learning of personalized models by sharing knowledge between similar
tasks while preserving the unique characteristics of each subpopulation.
Experimental results in simulation and case study datasets demonstrate the
superior performance of the proposed method compared to several benchmarks,
particularly in scenarios with high variability among subpopulations. The
proposed framework not only improves prediction accuracy but also enhances
interpretability by revealing underlying patterns that contribute to the
personalization of models.

Conclusion: 该环境为开放式多段设置中社交智能AI代理的发展研究提供了平台，有助于探索社交学习、隐式合作和竞争对代理学习和行为适应的影响。

Abstract: Many challenges remain before AI agents can be deployed in real-world
environments. However, one virtue of such environments is that they are
inherently multi-agent and contain human experts. Using advanced social
intelligence in such an environment can help an AI agent learn adaptive skills
and behaviors that a known expert exhibits. While social intelligence could
accelerate training, it is currently difficult to study due to the lack of
open-ended multi-agent environments. In this work, we present an environment in
which multiple self-interested agents can pursue complex and independent goals,
reflective of real world challenges. This environment will enable research into
the development of socially intelligent AI agents in open-ended multi-agent
settings, where agents may be implicitly incentivized to cooperate to defeat
common enemies, build and share tools, and achieve long horizon goals. In this
work, we investigate the impact on agent performance due to social learning in
the presence of experts and implicit cooperation such as emergent collaborative
tool use, and whether agents can benefit from either cooperation or competition
in this environment.

Conclusion: 这些改进显著提升了PECANN框架的鲁棒性、效率和适用性，使其能够处理科学计算中的苛刻问题

Abstract: We present several advances to the physics and equality constrained
artificial neural networks (PECANN) framework that substantially improve its
capability to learn solutions of canonical partial differential equations
(PDEs). First, we generalize the augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) to support
multiple independent penalty parameters, enabling simultaneous enforcement of
heterogeneous constraints. Second, we reformulate pointwise constraint
enforcement and Lagrange multipliers as expectations over constraint terms,
reducing memory overhead and permitting efficient mini-batch training. Third,
to address PDEs with oscillatory, multi-scale features, we incorporate Fourier
feature mappings and show that a single mapping suffices where multiple
mappings or more costly architectures were required in related methods. Fourth,
we introduce a time-windowing strategy for long-time evolution in which the
terminal state of each window is enforced as an initial-condition constraint
for the next, ensuring continuity without discrete time models. Crucially, we
propose a conditionally adaptive penalty update (CAPU) strategy for ALM, which
preserves the principle that larger constraint violations incur stronger
penalties. CAPU accelerates the growth of Lagrange multipliers for selectively
challenging constraints, enhancing constraint enforcement during training. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of PECANN-CAPU on problems including the
transonic rarefaction problem, reversible advection of a passive by a vortex,
high-wavenumber Helmholtz and Poisson equations, and inverse identification of
spatially varying heat sources. Comparisons with established methods and recent
Kolmogorov-Arnold network approaches show that PECANN-CAPU achieves competitive
accuracy across all cases. Collectively, these advances improve PECANN's
robustness, efficiency, and applicability to demanding problems in scientific
computing.

TL;DR: 本文研究了D-Wave量子逆灰冰器与经典MCMC在RBM采样性能的差异，尝试混合采样方法改善RBM训练，虽未成功但发现量子采样在减轻恐怖忘印方面具有潜力。


<details>

Motivation: 解释之前使用D-Wave量子逆灰器进行RBM采样时缺乏显著改善的原因，并探索如何利用量子与经典采样方法的差异来改善机器学习性能。

Method: 提出了一种新的混合采样方法，结合了经典Markov链蒙特卡洛(MCMC)和量子逆灰(QA)的采样贡献，并将其应用于受限环布尔典网络(RBM)训练。

Result: 混合采样方法在RBM训练中未实现显著改善，但首次证明了使用D-Wave量子逆灰器生成的模式可以有效减轻恐怖忘印(CF)，效果与经典方法相当。

Conclusion: 量子逆灰器与MCMC在分布低概率区域的差异不足以改善RBM训练，但量子采样在生成多样化低概率模式方面具有潜力，特别是在减轻恐怖忘印等具有挑战性的机器学习应用中。

Abstract: Modest statistical differences between the sampling performances of the
D-Wave quantum annealer (QA) and the classical Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC),
when applied to Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), are explored to explain,
and possibly address, the absence of significant and consistent improvements in
RBM trainability when the D-Wave sampling was used in previous investigations.
A novel hybrid sampling approach, combining the classical and the QA
contributions, is investigated as a promising way to benefit from the modest
differences between the two sampling methods. No improvements in the RBM
training are achieved in this work, thereby suggesting that the differences
between the QA-based and MCMC sampling, mainly found in the medium-to-low
probability regions of the distribution, which are less important for the
quality of the sample, are insufficient to benefit the training. Difficulties
in achieving sufficiently high quality of embedding RBMs into the lattice of
the newer generation of D-Wave hardware could be further complicating the task.
On the other hand, the ability to generate samples of sufficient variety from
lower-probability parts of the distribution has a potential to benefit other
machine learning applications, such as the mitigation of catastrophic
forgetting (CF) during incremental learning. The feasibility of using
QA-generated patterns of desirable classes for CF mitigation by the generative
replay is demonstrated in this work for the first time. While the efficiency of
the CF mitigation using the D-Wave QA was comparable to that of the classical
mitigation, both the speed of generating a large number of distinct desirable
patterns and the potential for further improvement make this approach promising
for a variety of challenging machine learning applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分布式训练方法在带宽受限环境下（如跨数据中心）仍存在通信瓶颈，且性能略低于基准方法，需要更有效的压缩技术。

Method: 结合Top-k稀疏化和量化技术，利用外部动量的局部近似和误差反馈，实现稀疏聚合来提升性能。

Result: 在多种通信受限的LLM训练场景中，SparseLoCo在性能和通信成本方面都显示出显著优势。

Conclusion: SparseLoCo通过极端压缩技术有效解决了分布式LLM训练中的通信瓶颈问题，同时保持了优异的模型性能。

Abstract: Communication-efficient distributed training algorithms have received
considerable interest recently due to their benefits for training Large
Language Models (LLMs) in bandwidth-constrained settings, such as across data
centers and over the internet. Despite reducing communication frequency, these
methods still typically require communicating a full copy of the model's
gradients-resulting in a communication bottleneck even for cross-datacenter
links. Furthermore, they can slightly degrade performance compared to a naive
AdamW DDP baseline. While quantization and error feedback are often applied to
reduce the pseudo-gradient's size, in the context of LLM pre-training, existing
approaches have been unable to additionally leverage sparsification and have
obtained limited quantization. In this work, we introduce SparseLoCo, a
communication-efficient training algorithm for LLMs that effectively leverages
Top-k sparsification and quantization to reach extreme compression ratios of up
to 1-3% sparsity and 2-bit quantization while outperforming full-precision
DiLoCo. Our key observations are that outer momentum can be locally
approximated by an error feedback combined with aggressive sparsity and that
sparse aggregation can actually improve model performance. We empirically
demonstrate in a range of communication-constrained LLM training settings that
SparseLoCo provides significant benefits in both performance and communication
cost.

Abstract: Extracting meaning from uncertain, noisy data is a fundamental problem across
time series analysis, pattern recognition, and language modeling. This survey
presents a unified mathematical framework that connects classical estimation
theory, statistical inference, and modern machine learning, including deep
learning and large language models. By analyzing how techniques such as maximum
likelihood estimation, Bayesian inference, and attention mechanisms address
uncertainty, the paper illustrates that many AI methods are rooted in shared
probabilistic principles. Through illustrative scenarios including system
identification, image classification, and language generation, we show how
increasingly complex models build upon these foundations to tackle practical
challenges like overfitting, data sparsity, and interpretability. In other
words, the work demonstrates that maximum likelihood, MAP estimation, Bayesian
classification, and deep learning all represent different facets of a shared
goal: inferring hidden causes from noisy and/or biased observations. It serves
as both a theoretical synthesis and a practical guide for students and
researchers navigating the evolving landscape of machine learning.

Motivation: 尽管似然在理论上是最优的OOD检测器，但在实践中经常失败。研究旨在探索这是像素空间的问题还是表示空间也存在密度估计困难。

Method: 训练变分扩散模型在预训练ResNet-18的表示空间上进行密度估计，使用OpenOOD套件与最先进方法进行比较。

Result: 表示空间的似然检测器性能优于像素空间，但仍未达到最先进方法的水平，表明表示空间也存在密度估计挑战。

Conclusion: 虽然表示空间改善了似然检测器的性能，但密度估计仍然是OOD检测的关键挑战，需要进一步研究更好的表示学习方法。

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in AI, safety remains the main bottleneck to deploying
machine-learning systems. A critical safety component is out-of-distribution
detection: given an input, decide whether it comes from the same distribution
as the training data. In generative models, the most natural OOD score is the
data likelihood. Actually, under the assumption of uniformly distributed OOD
data, the likelihood is even the optimal OOD detector, as we show in this work.
However, earlier work reported that likelihood often fails in practice, raising
doubts about its usefulness. We explore whether, in practice, the
representation space also suffers from the inability to learn good density
estimation for OOD detection, or if it is merely a problem of the pixel space
typically used in generative models. To test this, we trained a Variational
Diffusion Model not on images, but on the representation space of a pre-trained
ResNet-18 to assess the performance of our likelihood-based detector in
comparison to state-of-the-art methods from the OpenOOD suite.

Abstract: In recent years, a plethora of open-source foundation models have emerged,
achieving remarkable progress in some widely attended fields, with performance
being quite close to that of closed-source models. However, in high-value but
more challenging scientific professional fields, either the fields still rely
on expert models, or the progress of general foundation models lags
significantly compared to those in popular areas, far from sufficient for
transforming scientific research and leaving substantial gap between
open-source models and closed-source models in these scientific domains. To
mitigate this gap and explore a step further toward Artificial General
Intelligence (AGI), we introduce Intern-S1, a specialized generalist equipped
with general understanding and reasoning capabilities with expertise to analyze
multiple science modal data. Intern-S1 is a multimodal Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)

Abstract: Recent efforts have extended the capabilities of transformers in logical
reasoning and symbolic computations. In this work, we investigate their
capacity for non-linear latent pattern discovery in the context of functional
decomposition, focusing on the challenging algebraic task of multivariate
polynomial decomposition. This problem, with widespread applications in science
and engineering, is proved to be NP-hard, and demands both precision and
insight. Our contributions are threefold: First, we develop a synthetic data
generation pipeline providing fine-grained control over problem complexity.
Second, we train transformer models via supervised learning and evaluate them
across four key dimensions involving scaling behavior and generalizability.
Third, we propose Beam Grouped Relative Policy Optimization (BGRPO), a
rank-aware reinforcement learning method suitable for hard algebraic problems.
Finetuning with BGRPO improves accuracy while reducing beam width by up to

*Thorsten Hellert,João Montenegro,Antonin Sulc*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: Alpha Berkeley Framework是一个用于安全关键领域异构控制系统工作流协调的生产就绪架构，通过动态能力分类、计划优先编排和上下文感知任务提取等技术，提供可扩展、可靠且具有人工监督的智能体系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决异构控制系统工作流协调的挑战，特别是在科学设施、工业厂房和能源基础设施等安全关键环境中，现有方法缺乏可扩展性、可靠性和人工监督。

Method: 采用动态能力分类选择相关工具、计划优先编排模型生成具有明确依赖关系的执行计划、上下文感知任务提取结合对话历史和外部资源、生产就绪执行环境包含检查点、工件管理和模块化部署。

Result: 通过风电场监控案例和先进光源粒子加速器部署两个案例研究证明了框架的通用性，展示了在高风险领域中作为可靠透明智能体系统的能力。

Conclusion: Alpha Berkeley Framework为高风险领域的智能体系统提供了一个可靠且透明的框架，成功解决了异构控制系统工作流协调的核心挑战。

Abstract: Coordinating workflows across heterogeneous control systems remains a central
challenge in safety-critical environments such as scientific facilities,
industrial plants, and energy infrastructures. Language-model-driven agents
offer a natural interface for these tasks, but existing approaches often lack
scalability, reliability, and human oversight. We introduce the Alpha Berkeley
Framework, a production-ready architecture for scalable agentic systems that
integrate conversational context with robust tool orchestration. The framework
features dynamic capability classification to select only relevant tools per
task, a plan-first orchestration model that generates execution plans with
explicit dependencies and optional human approval, context-aware task
extraction that combines dialogue history with external memory and domain
resources, and production-ready execution environments with checkpointing,
artifact management, and modular deployment. We demonstrate its versatility
through two case studies: a tutorial-style wind farm monitoring example and a
deployment at the Advanced Light Source particle accelerator. These results
establish Alpha Berkeley as a reliable and transparent framework for agentic
systems in high-stakes domains.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: HEAS是一个Python框架，将分层代理建模与进化优化和锦标赛评估统一在单一可复现的工作流中，通过确定性层次调度和共享上下文实现跨尺度耦合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决多尺度代理建模中跨尺度耦合不明确、评估标准不统一、代码重复多的问题，提供一个可复现、可比较的跨学科研究基础框架。

Method: 使用轻量级进程（streams）的分层架构，通过确定性调度和共享上下文实现机制与编排的分离，支持单/多目标进化优化、PyTorch策略集成和用户定义的锦标赛规则。

Result: 框架提供了紧凑的API和CLI，标准化了评估指标，持久化种子和档案，提供可视化工具，减少了胶水代码并提高了研究间的可比性。

Conclusion: HEAS为跨学科、多层次的系统研究提供了实用的基础框架，能够产生可靠且可复现的结果，通过两个示例展示了其应用价值。

Abstract: Hierarchical Evolutionary Agent Simulation (HEAS) is a Python framework that
unifies layered agent-based modeling with evolutionary optimization and
tournament evaluation in a single, reproducible workflow. HEAS represents
models as hierarchies of lightweight processes ("streams") scheduled in
deterministic layers that read and write a shared context, making cross-scale
couplings explicit and auditable. A compact API and CLI-simulate, optimize,
evaluate-expose single- and multi-objective evolution, PyTorch policy
integration via parameter flattening/unflattening, and general tournament
tooling with user-defined scoring and voting rules. The framework standardizes
evaluation through uniform per-step and episode metrics, persists seeds,
logbooks, and hall-of-fame archives, and provides plotting helpers for traces,
Pareto fronts, and comparative outcomes, reducing glue code and improving
comparability across studies. HEAS emphasizes separation of mechanism from
orchestration, allowing exogenous drivers, endogenous agents, and aggregators
to be composed and swapped without refactoring, while the same model can be
used for forward simulation, optimization, or systematic comparison. We
illustrate usage with two compact examples-an ecological system and an
enterprise decision-making setting. HEAS offers a practical foundation for
cross-disciplinary, multi-level inquiry, yielding reliable, reproducible
results.

### [231] [Robust Symbolic Reasoning for Visual Narratives via Hierarchical and Semantically Normalized Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14941)
*Yi-Chun Chen*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个语义规范化框架，用于解决视觉叙事图中存在的不一致性和冗余问题，通过词汇相似性和嵌入聚类来整合语义相关的动作和事件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉叙事（如漫画）需要结构化表示来捕捉事件、角色及其关系，但符号化叙事图常存在不一致性和冗余，限制了推理和泛化的有效性。

Method: 基于认知基础的叙事理解模型，使用词汇相似性和嵌入聚类方法来整合语义相关的动作和事件，减少标注噪声并保持可解释性。

Result: 在Manga109数据集上的评估显示，语义规范化在动作检索、角色定位和事件摘要等叙事推理任务中提高了连贯性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 语义规范化是构建可扩展、认知启发的多模态叙事理解图模型的关键步骤。

Abstract: Understanding visual narratives such as comics requires structured
representations that capture events, characters, and their relations across
multiple levels of story organization. However, symbolic narrative graphs often
suffer from inconsistency and redundancy, where similar actions or events are
labeled differently across annotations or contexts. Such variance limits the
effectiveness of reasoning and generalization.
  This paper introduces a semantic normalization framework for hierarchical
narrative knowledge graphs. Building on cognitively grounded models of
narrative comprehension, we propose methods that consolidate semantically
related actions and events using lexical similarity and embedding-based
clustering. The normalization process reduces annotation noise, aligns symbolic
categories across narrative levels, and preserves interpretability.
  We demonstrate the framework on annotated manga stories from the Manga109
dataset, applying normalization to panel-, event-, and story-level graphs.
Preliminary evaluations across narrative reasoning tasks, such as action
retrieval, character grounding, and event summarization, show that semantic
normalization improves coherence and robustness, while maintaining symbolic
transparency. These findings suggest that normalization is a key step toward
scalable, cognitively inspired graph models for multimodal narrative
understanding.

TL;DR: Holo-Artisan是一个创新的虚拟博物馆系统，通过全息显示和边缘智能技术，实现多用户沉浸式体验，让数字艺术品能够实时个性化响应每位观众。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统博物馆展览是静态的，缺乏与观众的互动性。作者希望创造一种动态的、个性化的文化体验，让艺术品能够与每位观众进行实时对话和互动。

Method: 采用边缘计算节点处理实时用户数据（姿态、表情、语音），生成式AI驱动数字艺术品响应，云端协作平台整合交互并使用光线追踪渲染，结合联邦学习保护隐私并持续优化个性化体验。

Result: 系统能够实现多用户同时体验，例如蒙娜丽莎可以对一位观众微笑，同时与另一位观众进行语音问答，所有交互都是实时进行的。

Conclusion: Holo-Artisan将静态博物馆展品转变为动态的、有生命的艺术品，开创了文化遗产互动的新范式，通过边缘计算和联邦学习实现了低延迟、高保真且隐私保护的个性化体验。

Abstract: We present Holo-Artisan, a novel system architecture enabling immersive
multi-user experiences in virtual museums through true holographic displays and
personalized edge intelligence. In our design, local edge computing nodes
process real-time user data -- including pose, facial expression, and voice --
for multiple visitors concurrently. Generative AI models then drive digital
artworks (e.g., a volumetric Mona Lisa) to respond uniquely to each viewer. For
instance, the Mona Lisa can return a smile to one visitor while engaging in a
spoken Q\&A with another, all in real time. A cloud-assisted collaboration
platform composes these interactions in a shared scene using a universal scene
description, and employs ray tracing to render high-fidelity, personalized
views with a direct pipeline to glasses-free holographic displays. To preserve
user privacy and continuously improve personalization, we integrate federated
learning (FL) -- edge devices locally fine-tune AI models and share only model
updates for aggregation. This edge-centric approach minimizes latency and
bandwidth usage, ensuring a synchronized shared experience with individual
customization. Through Holo-Artisan, static museum exhibits are transformed
into dynamic, living artworks that engage each visitor in a personal dialogue,
heralding a new paradigm of cultural heritage interaction.

Abstract: Recent years have brought about a surge in neuromorphic ``event'' video
research, primarily targeting computer vision applications. Event video eschews
video frames in favor of asynchronous, per-pixel intensity samples. While much
work has focused on a handful of representations for specific event cameras,
these representations have shown limitations in flexibility, speed, and
compressibility. We previously proposed the unified AD{\Delta}ER representation
to address these concerns. This paper introduces numerous improvements to the
\textit{adder-viz} software for visualizing real-time event transcode processes
and applications in-the-loop. The MIT-licensed software is available from a

Conclusion: 该系统成功解决了户外旅游景区的动态3D抓取挑战，为广域场景的实时可视化提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Various real-time methods for capturing and transmitting dynamic 3D spaces
have been proposed, including those based on RGB-D cameras and volumetric
capture. However, applying existing methods to outdoor tourist sites remains
difficult because maintenance and aesthetic constraints limit sensor placement,
and daylight variability complicates processing. We propose a system that
combines multiple LiDARs and cameras for live dynamic point cloud capture, and
integrates them with pre-captured static point clouds for wide-area 3D
visualization. The system sustains 30 fps across wide-area scenes while keeping
latency below 100 ms. To mitigate lighting inconsistencies, static point-cloud
colors are automatically adjusted to current lighting. The effectiveness of our
system is demonstrated through real-world deployment in a tourist site.

Abstract: In hazardous and remote environments, robotic systems perform critical tasks
demanding improved safety and efficiency. Among these, quadruped robots with
manipulator arms offer mobility and versatility for complex operations.
However, teleoperating quadruped robots is challenging due to the lack of
integrated obstacle detection and intuitive control methods for the robotic
arm, increasing collision risks in confined or dynamically changing workspaces.
Teleoperation via joysticks or pads can be non-intuitive and demands a high
level of expertise due to its complexity, culminating in a high cognitive load
on the operator. To address this challenge, a teleoperation approach that
directly maps human arm movements to the robotic manipulator offers a simpler
and more accessible solution. This work proposes an intuitive remote control by
leveraging a vision-based pose estimation pipeline that utilizes an external
camera with a machine learning-based model to detect the operator's wrist
position. The system maps these wrist movements into robotic arm commands to
control the robot's arm in real-time. A trajectory planner ensures safe
teleoperation by detecting and preventing collisions with both obstacles and
the robotic arm itself. The system was validated on the real robot,
demonstrating robust performance in real-time control. This teleoperation
approach provides a cost-effective solution for industrial applications where
safety, precision, and ease of use are paramount, ensuring reliable and
intuitive robotic control in high-risk environments.

Abstract: Dexterous robotic hands enable versatile interactions due to the flexibility
and adaptability of multi-fingered designs, allowing for a wide range of
task-specific grasp configurations in diverse environments. However, to fully
exploit the capabilities of dexterous hands, access to diverse and high-quality
grasp data is essential -- whether for developing grasp prediction models from
point clouds, training manipulation policies, or supporting high-level task
planning with broader action options. Existing approaches for dataset
generation typically rely on sampling-based algorithms or simplified
force-closure analysis, which tend to converge to power grasps and often
exhibit limited diversity. In this work, we propose a method to synthesize
large-scale, diverse, and physically feasible grasps that extend beyond simple
power grasps to include refined manipulations, such as pinches and tri-finger
precision grasps. We introduce a rigorous, differentiable energy formulation of
force closure, implicitly defined through a Quadratic Program (QP).
Additionally, we present an adjusted optimization method (MALA*) that improves
performance by dynamically rejecting gradient steps based on the distribution
of energy values across all samples. We extensively evaluate our approach and
demonstrate significant improvements in both grasp diversity and the stability
of final grasp predictions. Finally, we provide a new, large-scale grasp
dataset for 5,700 objects from DexGraspNet, comprising five different grippers
and three distinct grasp types.

Abstract: Attention-based architectures trained on internet-scale language data have
demonstrated state of the art reasoning ability for various language-based
tasks, such as logic problems and textual reasoning. Additionally, these Large
Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited the ability to perform few-shot
prediction via in-context learning, in which input-output examples provided in
the prompt are generalized to new inputs. This ability furthermore extends
beyond standard language tasks, enabling few-shot learning for general
patterns. In this work, we consider the application of in-context learning with
pre-trained language models for dynamic manipulation. Dynamic manipulation
introduces several crucial challenges, including increased dimensionality,
complex dynamics, and partial observability. To address this, we take an
iterative approach, and formulate our in-context learning problem to predict
adjustments to a parametric policy based on previous interactions. We show
across several tasks in simulation and on a physical robot that utilizing
in-context learning outperforms alternative methods in the low data regime.

Abstract: Like mammals, robots must rapidly learn to control their bodies and interact
with their environment despite incomplete knowledge of their body structure and
surroundings. They must also adapt to continuous changes in both. This work
presents a bio-inspired learning algorithm, General-to-Particular (G2P),
applied to a tendon-driven quadruped robotic system developed and fabricated
in-house. Our quadruped robot undergoes an initial five-minute phase of
generalized motor babbling, followed by 15 refinement trials (each lasting 20
seconds) to achieve specific cyclical movements. This process mirrors the
exploration-exploitation paradigm observed in mammals. With each refinement,
the robot progressively improves upon its initial "good enough" solution. Our
results serve as a proof-of-concept, demonstrating the hardware-in-the-loop
system's ability to learn the control of a tendon-driven quadruped with
redundancies in just a few minutes to achieve functional and adaptive cyclical
non-convex movements. By advancing autonomous control in robotic locomotion,
our approach paves the way for robots capable of dynamically adjusting to new
environments, ensuring sustained adaptability and performance.

Conclusion: Mag-Match为恶劣环境下的多会话或多机器人数据集成提供了有效的磁场地图匹配解决方案，具有重要的实际应用价值

Abstract: Map matching and registration are essential tasks in robotics for
localisation and integration of multi-session or multi-robot data. Traditional
methods rely on cameras or LiDARs to capture visual or geometric information
but struggle in challenging conditions like smoke or dust. Magnetometers, on
the other hand, detect magnetic fields, revealing features invisible to other
sensors and remaining robust in such environments. In this paper, we introduce
Mag-Match, a novel method for extracting and describing features in 3D magnetic
vector field maps to register different maps of the same area. Our feature
descriptor, based on higher-order derivatives of magnetic field maps, is
invariant to global orientation, eliminating the need for gravity-aligned
mapping. To obtain these higher-order derivatives map-wide given point-wise
magnetometer data, we leverage a physics-informed Gaussian Process to perform
efficient and recursive probabilistic inference of both the magnetic field and
its derivatives. We evaluate Mag-Match in simulated and real-world experiments
against a SIFT-based approach, demonstrating accurate map-to-map, robot-to-map,
and robot-to-robot transformations - even without initial gravitational
alignment.

Abstract: The logistics and construction industries face persistent challenges in
automating pallet handling, especially in outdoor environments with variable
payloads, inconsistencies in pallet quality and dimensions, and unstructured

that leverages foundation models for natural language-guided pallet detection
and 6D pose estimation, enabling operators to specify targets through intuitive
commands such as "pick up the steel beam pallet near the crane." The perception
pipeline integrates Florence-2 and SAM-2 for language-grounded segmentation
with FoundationPose for robust pose estimation in cluttered, multi-pallet
outdoor scenes under variable lighting. The resulting poses feed into a motion
planning module for fully autonomous forklift operation. We validate Lang2Lift
on the ADAPT autonomous forklift platform, achieving 0.76 mIoU pallet

TL;DR: SRDrone是一个用于工业级无人机自我精化任务规划的新系统，通过连续状态评估和行为树分层修改模型，实现了44.87%的成功率提升，最终达到96.25%的成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖单帧最终状态评估，无法满足连续动态无人机操作的需求，需要开发更鲁棒准确的任务结果评估方法和结构化反思学习机制。

Method: 1. 采用连续状态评估方法进行鲁棒准确的任务结果判定和解释性反馈；2. 实现分层行为树修改模型，结合多级BT计划分析和约束策略空间，支持结构化反思学习。

Result: 实验结果显示SRDrone相比基线方法成功率提升44.87%，通过迭代自我精化优化的经验库在真实部署中达到96.25%的成功率。

Conclusion: SRDrone成功将大语言模型的通用推理智能与无人机严格物理执行约束相结合，在工业级BT规划框架内嵌入了自适应任务精化能力。

Abstract: We introduce SRDrone, a novel system designed for self-refinement task
planning in industrial-grade embodied drones. SRDrone incorporates two key
technical contributions: First, it employs a continuous state evaluation
methodology to robustly and accurately determine task outcomes and provide
explanatory feedback. This approach supersedes conventional reliance on
single-frame final-state assessment for continuous, dynamic drone operations.
Second, SRDrone implements a hierarchical Behavior Tree (BT) modification
model. This model integrates multi-level BT plan analysis with a constrained
strategy space to enable structured reflective learning from experience.
Experimental results demonstrate that SRDrone achieves a 44.87% improvement in
Success Rate (SR) over baseline methods. Furthermore, real-world deployment
utilizing an experience base optimized through iterative self-refinement
attains a 96.25% SR. By embedding adaptive task refinement capabilities within
an industrial-grade BT planning framework, SRDrone effectively integrates the
general reasoning intelligence of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the
stringent physical execution constraints inherent to embodied drones. Code is

TL;DR: Kitchen-R是一个新的机器人基准测试，在模拟厨房环境中统一评估任务规划与低级控制，填补了高层语言指令与低级执行之间的评估空白


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试存在明显脱节：高层语言指令跟随基准假设完美低级执行，而低级控制基准依赖简单单步指令，无法全面评估任务规划和物理执行都至关重要的集成系统

Method: 基于Isaac Sim模拟器构建数字孪生厨房环境，包含500+复杂语言指令，支持移动机械臂机器人。提供基于视觉语言模型的任务规划策略和基于扩散策略的低级控制策略基线方法，以及轨迹收集系统

Result: Kitchen-R基准提供了三种评估模式的灵活框架：规划模块独立评估、控制策略独立评估，以及关键的系统集成评估

Conclusion: Kitchen-R填补了具身AI研究中的关键空白，实现了对语言引导机器人代理更全面和现实的基准测试

Abstract: Benchmarks are crucial for evaluating progress in robotics and embodied AI.
However, a significant gap exists between benchmarks designed for high-level
language instruction following, which often assume perfect low-level execution,
and those for low-level robot control, which rely on simple, one-step commands.
This disconnect prevents a comprehensive evaluation of integrated systems where
both task planning and physical execution are critical. To address this, we
propose Kitchen-R, a novel benchmark that unifies the evaluation of task
planning and low-level control within a simulated kitchen environment. Built as
a digital twin using the Isaac Sim simulator and featuring more than 500
complex language instructions, Kitchen-R supports a mobile manipulator robot.
We provide baseline methods for our benchmark, including a task-planning
strategy based on a vision-language model and a low-level control policy based
on diffusion policy. We also provide a trajectory collection system. Our
benchmark offers a flexible framework for three evaluation modes: independent
assessment of the planning module, independent assessment of the control
policy, and, crucially, an integrated evaluation of the whole system. Kitchen-R
bridges a key gap in embodied AI research, enabling more holistic and realistic
benchmarking of language-guided robotic agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学习型灵巧操作策略经常出现空闲现象（停止移动），这反映了训练数据的局限性，特别是在需要高精度动作的区域。现有方法如数据过滤或控制频率调整可能对策略性能产生负面影响

Method: PIP方法检测策略空闲状态，并在这些状态下施加扰动，帮助策略逃离问题吸引域。该方法无需额外监督或训练，通过扰动促进探索和策略改进

Result: 在模拟双臂任务中显著改善测试性能，在真实世界插入任务中实现15-35%的绝对成功率提升，特别是在需要复杂多指操作的任务上表现优异

Conclusion: PIP是一种简单有效的策略改进方法，能够利用空闲行为的可检测性来指导探索，在关键运动点施加扰动可以带来更好的迭代策略改进效果

Abstract: Learning-based methods for dexterous manipulation have made notable progress
in recent years. However, learned policies often still lack reliability and
exhibit limited robustness to important factors of variation. One failure
pattern that can be observed across many settings is that policies idle, i.e.
they cease to move beyond a small region of states when they reach certain
states. This policy idling is often a reflection of the training data. For
instance, it can occur when the data contains small actions in areas where the
robot needs to perform high-precision motions, e.g., when preparing to grasp an
object or object insertion. Prior works have tried to mitigate this phenomenon
e.g. by filtering the training data or modifying the control frequency.
However, these approaches can negatively impact policy performance in other
ways. As an alternative, we investigate how to leverage the detectability of
idling behavior to inform exploration and policy improvement. Our approach,
Pause-Induced Perturbations (PIP), applies perturbations at detected idling
states, thus helping it to escape problematic basins of attraction. On a range
of challenging simulated dual-arm tasks, we find that this simple approach can
already noticeably improve test-time performance, with no additional
supervision or training. Furthermore, since the robot tends to idle at critical
points in a movement, we also find that learning from the resulting episodes
leads to better iterative policy improvement compared to prior approaches. Our
perturbation strategy also leads to a 15-35% improvement in absolute success
rate on a real-world insertion task that requires complex multi-finger
manipulation.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注最小化动态耦合，但忽略了其潜在优势。本研究探索如何利用动态耦合来提升轨迹规划性能

Method: 采用动态耦合矩阵的奇异值分解识别主导耦合分量，构建量化指标表征耦合强度和方向性，并集成到轨迹优化框架中，设计滑模控制器验证轨迹可行性

Result: 仿真结果表明，在轨迹规划中显式考虑动态耦合能够实现更智能和潜在更高效的操作

Conclusion: 该方法为自由浮动空间机械臂系统的控制提供了新方向，证明了利用动态耦合的可行性

Abstract: This study proposes a dynamic coupling-informed trajectory optimization
algorithm for free-floating space manipulator systems (SMSs). Dynamic coupling
between the base and the manipulator arms plays a critical role in influencing
the system's behavior. While prior research has predominantly focused on
minimizing this coupling, often overlooking its potential advantages, this work
investigates how dynamic coupling can instead be leveraged to improve
trajectory planning. Singular value decomposition (SVD) of the dynamic coupling
matrix is employed to identify the dominant components governing coupling
behavior. A quantitative metric is then formulated to characterize the strength
and directionality of the coupling and is incorporated into a trajectory
optimization framework. To assess the feasibility of the optimized trajectory,
a sliding mode control-based tracking controller is designed to generate the
required joint torque inputs. Simulation results demonstrate that explicitly
accounting for dynamic coupling in trajectory planning enables more informed
and potentially more efficient operation, offering new directions for the
control of free-floating SMSs.

Conclusion: NeRD为解决机器人神经模拟器的泛化问题提供了有效方案，能够替代传统模拟器组件，实现高效准确的动力学仿真，并具备从真实数据学习的能力。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient simulation of modern robots remains challenging due to
their high degrees of freedom and intricate mechanisms. Neural simulators have
emerged as a promising alternative to traditional analytical simulators,
capable of efficiently predicting complex dynamics and adapting to real-world
data; however, existing neural simulators typically require
application-specific training and fail to generalize to novel tasks and/or
environments, primarily due to inadequate representations of the global state.
In this work, we address the problem of learning generalizable neural
simulators for robots that are structured as articulated rigid bodies. We
propose NeRD (Neural Robot Dynamics), learned robot-specific dynamics models
for predicting future states for articulated rigid bodies under contact
constraints. NeRD uniquely replaces the low-level dynamics and contact solvers
in an analytical simulator and employs a robot-centric and spatially-invariant
simulation state representation. We integrate the learned NeRD models as an
interchangeable backend solver within a state-of-the-art robotics simulator. We
conduct extensive experiments to show that the NeRD simulators are stable and
accurate over a thousand simulation steps; generalize across tasks and
environment configurations; enable policy learning exclusively in a neural
engine; and, unlike most classical simulators, can be fine-tuned from
real-world data to bridge the gap between simulation and reality.

Method: 采用两层隐藏层感知器神经网络结合信号处理技术，而非计算量大的卷积神经网络

Result: 在噪声RMS值与枪口冲击波峰值幅度相当时，检测率提高了一倍以上

Conclusion: 轻量级神经网络架构能有效提升移动军事环境中枪声检测系统的性能

Abstract: Acoem develops gunshot detection systems, consisting of a microphone array
and software that detects and locates shooters on the battlefield. The
performance of such systems is obviously affected by the acoustic environment
in which they are operating: in particular, when mounted on a moving military
vehicle, the presence of noise reduces the detection performance of the
software. To limit the influence of the acoustic environment, a neural network
has been developed. Instead of using a heavy convolutional neural network, a
lightweight neural network architecture was chosen to limit the computational
resources required to embed the algorithm on as many hardware platforms as
possible. Thanks to the combination of a two hidden layer perceptron and
appropriate signal processing techniques, the detection rate of impulsive
muzzle blast waveforms (the wave coming from the detonation and indicating the
position of the shooter) is significantly increased. With a rms value of noise
of the same order as the muzzle blast peak amplitude, the detect rate is more
than doubled with this denoising processing.

Abstract: This work proposes to explore a new area of dynamic speech emotion
recognition. Unlike traditional methods, we assume that each audio track is
associated with a sequence of emotions active at different moments in time. The
study particularly focuses on the animation of emotional 3D avatars. We propose
a multi-stage method that includes the training of a classical speech emotion
recognition model, synthetic generation of emotional sequences, and further
model improvement based on human feedback. Additionally, we introduce a novel
approach to modeling emotional mixtures based on the Dirichlet distribution.
The models are evaluated based on ground-truth emotions extracted from a
dataset of 3D facial animations. We compare our models against the sliding
window approach. Our experimental results show the effectiveness of
Dirichlet-based approach in modeling emotional mixtures. Incorporating human
feedback further improves the model quality while providing a simplified
annotation procedure.

Abstract: This paper proposes an eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)-driven
methodology to enhance the understanding of cough sound analysis for
respiratory disease management. We employ occlusion maps to highlight relevant
spectral regions in cough spectrograms processed by a Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN). Subsequently, spectral analysis of spectrograms weighted by
these occlusion maps reveals significant differences between disease groups,
particularly in patients with COPD, where cough patterns appear more variable
in the identified spectral regions of interest. This contrasts with the lack of
significant differences observed when analyzing raw spectrograms. The proposed
approach extracts and analyzes several spectral features, demonstrating the
potential of XAI techniques to uncover disease-specific acoustic signatures and
improve the diagnostic capabilities of cough sound analysis by providing more
interpretable results.

Abstract: Anomalous Sound Detection (ASD) aims at identifying anomalous sounds from
machines and has gained extensive research interests from both academia and
industry. However, the uncertainty of anomaly location and much redundant
information such as noise in machine sounds hinder the improvement of ASD
system performance. This paper proposes a novel audio feature of filter banks
with evenly distributed intervals, ensuring equal attention to all frequency
ranges in the audio, which enhances the detection of anomalies in machine
sounds. Moreover, based on pre-trained models, this paper presents a
parameter-free feature enhancement approach to remove redundant information in
machine audio. It is believed that this parameter-free strategy facilitates the
effective transfer of universal knowledge from pre-trained tasks to the ASD
task during model fine-tuning. Evaluation results on the Detection and
Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE) 2024 Challenge dataset
demonstrate significant improvements in ASD performance with our proposed

Abstract: AudioSet is a widely used benchmark in the audio research community and has
significantly advanced various audio-related tasks. However, persistent issues
with label accuracy and completeness remain critical bottlenecks that limit
performance in downstream applications.To address the aforementioned

general-purpose audio-language foundation models to systematically improve the
label quality of AudioSet. The framework employs a cross-modal prompting
strategy, inspired by the concept of prompt chaining, wherein prompts are
sequentially composed to execute subtasks (audio comprehension, label
synthesis, and semantic alignment). Leveraging this framework, we construct a
high-quality, structured relabeled version of AudioSet-R. Extensive experiments
conducted on representative audio classification models--including AST, PANNs,
SSAST, and AudioMAE--consistently demonstrate substantial performance
improvements, thereby validating the generalizability and effectiveness of the
proposed approach in enhancing label reliability.The code is publicly available

Motivation: 现有音频生成模型水印方法只能识别生成模型的身份，但无法追踪底层训练数据集，这在版权和问责场景中存在重大局限性。

Method: 提出Dual Watermark Embedding (DWE)模块在梅尔频谱图中嵌入双水印，配合Watermark Consistency Loss (WCL)确保从生成音频中可靠提取两种水印，并建立了Dual Attribution Benchmark (DAB)评估基准。

Abstract: Existing watermarking methods for audio generative models only enable
model-level attribution, allowing the identification of the originating
generation model, but are unable to trace the underlying training dataset. This
significant limitation raises critical provenance questions, particularly in
scenarios involving copyright and accountability concerns. To bridge this
fundamental gap, we introduce DualMark, the first dual-provenance watermarking
framework capable of simultaneously encoding two distinct attribution
signatures, i.e., model identity and dataset origin, into audio generative
models during training. Specifically, we propose a novel Dual Watermark
Embedding (DWE) module to seamlessly embed dual watermarks into Mel-spectrogram
representations, accompanied by a carefully designed Watermark Consistency Loss
(WCL), which ensures reliable extraction of both watermarks from generated
audio signals. Moreover, we establish the Dual Attribution Benchmark (DAB), the
first robustness evaluation benchmark specifically tailored for joint
model-data attribution. Extensive experiments validate that DualMark achieves
outstanding attribution accuracy (97.01% F1-score for model attribution, and
91.51% AUC for dataset attribution), while maintaining exceptional robustness
against aggressive pruning, lossy compression, additive noise, and sampling
attacks, conditions that severely compromise prior methods. Our work thus
provides a foundational step toward fully accountable audio generative models,
significantly enhancing copyright protection and responsibility tracing
capabilities.

Abstract: Speaker attribute perturbation offers a feasible approach to asynchronous
voice anonymization by employing adversarially perturbed speech as anonymized
output. In order to enhance the identity unlinkability among anonymized
utterances from the same original speaker, the targeted attack training
strategy is usually applied to anonymize the utterances to a common designated
speaker. However, this strategy may violate the privacy of the designated
speaker who is an actual speaker. To mitigate this risk, this paper proposes an
any-to-any training strategy. It is accomplished by defining a batch mean loss
to anonymize the utterances from various speakers within a training mini-batch
to a common pseudo-speaker, which is approximated as the average speaker in the
mini-batch. Based on this, a speaker-adversarial speech generation model is
proposed, incorporating the supervision from both the untargeted attack and the
any-to-any strategies. The speaker attribute perturbations are generated and
incorporated into the original speech to produce its anonymized version. The
effectiveness of the proposed model was justified in asynchronous voice
anonymization through experiments conducted on the VoxCeleb datasets.
Additional experiments were carried out to explore the potential limitations of
speaker-adversarial speech in voice privacy protection. With them, we aim to
provide insights for future research on its protective efficacy against
black-box speaker extractors \textcolor{black}{and adaptive attacks, as well
as} generalization to out-of-domain datasets \textcolor{black}{and stability}.

Abstract: Acoustic Scene Classification (ASC) is a fundamental problem in computational
audition, which seeks to classify environments based on the distinctive
acoustic features. In the ASC task of the APSIPA ASC 2025 Grand Challenge, the
organizers introduce a multimodal ASC task. Unlike traditional ASC systems that
rely solely on audio inputs, this challenge provides additional textual
information as inputs, including the location where the audio is recorded and
the time of recording. In this paper, we present our proposed system for the
ASC task in the APSIPA ASC 2025 Grand Challenge. Specifically, we propose a

hierarchical spectral features from spectrograms, followed by a dual-path Mamba

Result: 随机森林和梯度提升分类器表现最优，F2分数分别为0.987和0.986，准确率达99.7%和99.6%；支持向量机次之(0.896)；线性判别分析和逻辑回归中等(约0.749)；K近邻最差(0.691)。

Conclusion: 集成学习方法在近地天体危险预测中表现出色，模型选择应考虑数据集特性和评估指标，未来研究可关注超参数优化和特征工程以进一步提升性能。

Abstract: This study evaluates the performance of several machine learning models for
predicting hazardous near-Earth objects (NEOs) through a binary classification
framework, including data scaling, power transformation, and cross-validation.
Six classifiers were compared, namely Random Forest Classifier (RFC), Gradient
Boosting Classifier (GBC), Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Linear Discriminant
Analysis (LDA), Logistic Regression (LR), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). RFC
and GBC performed the best, both with an impressive F2-score of 0.987 and
0.986, respectively, with very small variability. SVC followed, with a lower
but reasonable score of 0.896. LDA and LR had a moderate performance with
scores of around 0.749 and 0.748, respectively, while KNN had a poor
performance with a score of 0.691 due to difficulty in handling complex data
patterns. RFC and GBC also presented great confusion matrices with a negligible
number of false positives and false negatives, which resulted in outstanding
accuracy rates of 99.7% and 99.6%, respectively. These findings highlight the
power of ensemble methods for high precision and recall and further point out
the importance of tailored model selection with regard to dataset
characteristics and chosen evaluation metrics. Future research could focus on
the optimization of hyperparameters with advanced features engineering to
further the accuracy and robustness of the model on NEO hazard predictions.

Motivation: 探索SVM核函数与量子格林函数之间未被充分研究的数学等价关系，为物理系统中的SVM模型提供理论支持和性能改进。

Method: 通过算子逆理论建立核函数与格林函数的对应关系，引入核多项式方法(KPM)设计符合格林函数的定制化核函数，并进行数值实验验证。

Result: 数值实验证实，使用与格林函数对应的正半定核函数能显著提高SVM模型在物理系统中的预测精度。sigmoid核函数在某些情况下不满足Mercer定理，对应的格林函数也可能表现不佳。

Conclusion: SVM核函数与量子格林函数之间存在深刻的数学等价性，利用这种关系设计定制化核函数可以有效提升SVM在物理应用中的性能表现。

Abstract: We establish a mathematical equivalence between Support Vector Machine (SVM)
kernel functions and quantum propagators represented by time-dependent Green's
functions, which has remained largely unexplored.
  We demonstrate that many common SVM kernels correspond naturally to Green's
functions via operator inversion theory. The sigmoid kernel does not always
satisfy Mercer's theorem, and therefore the corresponding Green's function may
also fail to perform optimally.
  We further introduce a Kernel Polynomial Method (KPM) for designing
customized kernels that align with Green's functions.
  Our numerical experiments confirm that employing positive-semidefinite
kernels that correspond to Green's functions significantly improves predictive
accuracy of SVM models in physical systems.

Abstract: The rapid development of machine learning and quantum computing has placed
quantum machine learning at the forefront of research. However, existing
quantum machine learning algorithms based on quantum variational algorithms
face challenges in trainability and noise robustness. In order to address these
challenges, we introduce a gradient-free, noise-robust quantum reservoir
computing algorithm that harnesses discrete time crystal dynamics as a
reservoir. We first calibrate the memory, nonlinear, and information scrambling
capacities of the quantum reservoir, revealing their correlation with dynamical
phases and non-equilibrium phase transitions. We then apply the algorithm to
the binary classification task and establish a comparative quantum kernel
advantage. For ten-class classification, both noisy simulations and
experimental results on superconducting quantum processors match ideal
simulations, demonstrating the enhanced accuracy with increasing system size
and confirming the topological noise robustness. Our work presents the first
experimental demonstration of quantum reservoir computing for image
classification based on digital quantum simulation. It establishes the
correlation between quantum many-body non-equilibrium phase transitions and
quantum machine learning performance, providing new design principles for
quantum reservoir computing and broader quantum machine learning algorithms in
the NISQ era.

Abstract: Tongue imaging serves as a valuable diagnostic tool, particularly in
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). The quality of tongue surface segmentation
significantly affects the accuracy of tongue image classification and
subsequent diagnosis in intelligent tongue diagnosis systems. However, existing
research on tongue image segmentation faces notable limitations, and there is a
lack of robust and user-friendly segmentation tools. This paper proposes a
tongue image segmentation model (TOM) based on multi-teacher knowledge
distillation. By incorporating a novel diffusion-based data augmentation
method, we enhanced the generalization ability of the segmentation model while
reducing its parameter size. Notably, after reducing the parameter count by
96.6% compared to the teacher models, the student model still achieves an
impressive segmentation performance of 95.22% mIoU. Furthermore, we packaged
and deployed the trained model as both an online and offline segmentation tool
(available at https://itongue.cn/), allowing TCM practitioners and researchers
to use it without any programming experience. We also present a case study on
TCM constitution classification using segmented tongue patches. Experimental
results demonstrate that training with tongue patches yields higher
classification performance and better interpretability than original tongue
images. To our knowledge, this is the first open-source and freely available
tongue image segmentation tool.

Abstract: Lossy compression and rate-adaptive streaming are a mainstay in traditional
video steams. However, a new class of neuromorphic ``event'' sensors records
video with asynchronous pixel samples rather than image frames. These sensors
are designed for computer vision applications, rather than human video
consumption. Until now, researchers have focused their efforts primarily on
application development, ignoring the crucial problem of data transmission. We
survey the landscape of event-based video systems, discuss the technical issues
with our recent scalable event streaming work, and propose a new low-latency
event streaming format based on the latest additions to the Media Over QUIC
protocol draft.

Conclusion: 通过利用涵盖模型生成的高质量2D X光投影作为外部先验知识，结合创新的3D重建技术，成功实现了无需成对数据的高性能零样本3D CT超分辨率重建

Abstract: Computed tomography (CT) is widely used in clinical diagnosis, but acquiring
high-resolution (HR) CT is limited by radiation exposure risks. Deep
learning-based super-resolution (SR) methods have been studied to reconstruct
HR from low-resolution (LR) inputs. While supervised SR approaches have shown
promising results, they require large-scale paired LR-HR volume datasets that
are often unavailable. In contrast, zero-shot methods alleviate the need for
paired data by using only a single LR input, but typically struggle to recover
fine anatomical details due to limited internal information. To overcome these,
we propose a novel zero-shot 3D CT SR framework that leverages upsampled 2D
X-ray projection priors generated by a diffusion model. Exploiting the
abundance of HR 2D X-ray data, we train a diffusion model on large-scale 2D
X-ray projection and introduce a per-projection adaptive sampling strategy. It
selects the generative process for each projection, thus providing HR
projections as strong external priors for 3D CT reconstruction. These
projections serve as inputs to 3D Gaussian splatting for reconstructing a 3D CT
volume. Furthermore, we propose negative alpha blending (NAB-GS) that allows
negative values in Gaussian density representation. NAB-GS enables residual
learning between LR and diffusion-based projections, thereby enhancing
high-frequency structure reconstruction. Experiments on two datasets show that
our method achieves superior quantitative and qualitative results for 3D CT SR.

Abstract: Anomaly detection is an emerging approach in digital pathology for its
ability to efficiently and effectively utilize data for disease diagnosis.
While supervised learning approaches deliver high accuracy, they rely on
extensively annotated datasets, suffering from data scarcity in digital
pathology. Unsupervised anomaly detection, however, offers a viable alternative
by identifying deviations from normal tissue distributions without requiring
exhaustive annotations. Recently, denoising diffusion probabilistic models have
gained popularity in unsupervised anomaly detection, achieving promising
performance in both natural and medical imaging datasets. Building on this, we
incorporate a vision-language model with a diffusion model for unsupervised
anomaly detection in digital pathology, utilizing histopathology prompts during
reconstruction. Our approach employs a set of pathology-related keywords
associated with normal tissues to guide the reconstruction process,
facilitating the differentiation between normal and abnormal tissues. To
evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct experiments on a
gastric lymph node dataset from a local hospital and assess its generalization
ability under domain shift using a public breast lymph node dataset. The
experimental results highlight the potential of the proposed method for
unsupervised anomaly detection across various organs in digital pathology.

Abstract: Numerous deep learning-based solutions have been developed for the automatic
recognition of breast cancer using mammography images. However, their
performance often declines when applied to data from different domains,
primarily due to domain shift -- the variation in data distributions between
source and target domains. This performance drop limits the safe and equitable
deployment of AI in real-world clinical settings. In this study, we present
DoSReMC (Domain Shift Resilient Mammography Classification), a batch
normalization (BN) adaptation framework designed to enhance cross-domain
generalization without retraining the entire model. Using three large-scale
full-field digital mammography (FFDM) datasets -- including HCTP, a newly
introduced, pathologically confirmed in-house dataset -- we conduct a
systematic cross-domain evaluation with convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
Our results demonstrate that BN layers are a primary source of domain
dependence: they perform effectively when training and testing occur within the
same domain, and they significantly impair model generalization under domain
shift. DoSReMC addresses this limitation by fine-tuning only the BN and fully
connected (FC) layers, while preserving pretrained convolutional filters. We
further integrate this targeted adaptation with an adversarial training scheme,
yielding additional improvements in cross-domain generalizability. DoSReMC can
be readily incorporated into existing AI pipelines and applied across diverse
clinical environments, providing a practical pathway toward more robust and
generalizable mammography classification systems.

Conclusion: DECSC框架成功统一了局部空谱相关性、非局部空间自相似性和全局空间一致性，为高光谱图像去噪提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Hyperspectral images (HSIs) play a crucial role in remote sensing but are
often degraded by complex noise patterns. Ensuring the physical property of the
denoised HSIs is vital for robust HSI denoising, giving the rise of deep
unfolding-based methods. However, these methods map the optimization of a
physical model to a learnable network with a predefined depth, which lacks
convergence guarantees. In contrast, Deep Equilibrium (DEQ) models treat the
hidden layers of deep networks as the solution to a fixed-point problem and
models them as infinite-depth networks, naturally consistent with the
optimization. Under the framework of DEQ, we propose a Deep Equilibrium
Convolutional Sparse Coding (DECSC) framework that unifies local
spatial-spectral correlations, nonlocal spatial self-similarities, and global
spatial consistency for robust HSI denoising. Within the convolutional sparse
coding (CSC) framework, we enforce shared 2D convolutional sparse
representation to ensure global spatial consistency across bands, while
unshared 3D convolutional sparse representation captures local spatial-spectral
details. To further exploit nonlocal self-similarities, a transformer block is
embedded after the 2D CSC. Additionally, a detail enhancement module is
integrated with the 3D CSC to promote image detail preservation. We formulate
the proximal gradient descent of the CSC model as a fixed-point problem and
transform the iterative updates into a learnable network architecture within
the framework of DEQ. Experimental results demonstrate that our DECSC method
achieves superior denoising performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 通过图像生成技术从低能量乳腺图像生成虚拟双能量减影图像，可减少患者接受高能量成像时的辐射暴露，具有重要的临床意义。

Method: 使用三种模型进行虚拟DES图像生成：预训练U-Net模型、端到端训练的U-Net模型和CycleGAN模型，并评估这些虚拟图像在乳腺病变分类任务中的性能。

Result: 预训练U-Net模型表现最佳，使用虚拟DES图像获得85.59%的F1分数，而使用真实DES图像为90.35%，存在一定性能差距但潜力显著。

Conclusion: 虚拟DES图像生成具有巨大潜力，未来技术进步可能缩小性能差距，使其在临床上完全替代真实DES图像成为可能。

Abstract: Contrast-enhanced spectral mammography (CESM) is an imaging modality that
provides two types of images, commonly known as low-energy (LE) and dual-energy
subtracted (DES) images. In many domains, particularly in medicine, the
emergence of image-to-image translation techniques has enabled the artificial
generation of images using other images as input. Within CESM, applying such
techniques to generate DES images from LE images could be highly beneficial,
potentially reducing patient exposure to radiation associated with high-energy
image acquisition. In this study, we investigated three models for the
artificial generation of DES images (virtual DES): a pre-trained U-Net model, a
U-Net trained end-to-end model, and a CycleGAN model. We also performed a
series of experiments to assess the impact of using virtual DES images on the
classification of CESM examinations into malignant and non-malignant
categories. To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the impact of
virtual DES images on CESM lesion classification. The results demonstrate that
the best performance was achieved with the pre-trained U-Net model, yielding an
F1 score of 85.59% when using the virtual DES images, compared to 90.35% with
the real DES images. This discrepancy likely results from the additional
diagnostic information in real DES images, which contributes to a higher
classification accuracy. Nevertheless, the potential for virtual DES image
generation is considerable and future advancements may narrow this performance
gap to a level where exclusive reliance on virtual DES images becomes
clinically viable.

Motivation: 医学影像中观察者间的标注不一致性引入了标签不确定性，特别是在肺部超声这种视觉解释主观性强的模态中。传统的绝对真实标签处理方式无法抓取这种内在的不确定性。

Method: 设计了一种数据标注协议，收集尊者提供的每个像素信心度值。在训练时使用不同的信心度阈值（如60%）对标签进行二值化处理，并证明高信心度阈值比传统的50%阈值方法更有效。

Abstract: In medical imaging, inter-observer variability among radiologists often
introduces label uncertainty, particularly in modalities where visual
interpretation is subjective. Lung ultrasound (LUS) is a prime example-it
frequently presents a mixture of highly ambiguous regions and clearly
discernible structures, making consistent annotation challenging even for
experienced clinicians. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to both
labeling and training AI models using expert-supplied, per-pixel confidence
values. Rather than treating annotations as absolute ground truth, we design a
data annotation protocol that captures the confidence that radiologists have in
each labeled region, modeling the inherent aleatoric uncertainty present in
real-world clinical data. We demonstrate that incorporating these confidence
values during training leads to improved segmentation performance. More
importantly, we show that this enhanced segmentation quality translates into
better performance on downstream clinically-critical tasks-specifically,
estimating S/F oxygenation ratio values, classifying S/F ratio change, and
predicting 30-day patient readmission. While we empirically evaluate many
methods for exposing the uncertainty to the learning model, we find that a
simple approach that trains a model on binarized labels obtained with a (60%)
confidence threshold works well. Importantly, high thresholds work far better
than a naive approach of a 50% threshold, indicating that training on very
confident pixels is far more effective. Our study systematically investigates
the impact of training with varying confidence thresholds, comparing not only
segmentation metrics but also downstream clinical outcomes. These results
suggest that label confidence is a valuable signal that, when properly
leveraged, can significantly enhance the reliability and clinical utility of AI
in medical imaging.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了基于GAN的超分辨率方法在4D Flow MRI中的应用，特别是针对近壁速度恢复问题，发现Wasserstein GAN在稳定性和性能方面表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D Flow MRI在临床应用中受限于低空间分辨率和噪声，特别是在近壁速度测量方面。虽然机器学习超分辨率方法有潜力，但近壁速度恢复仍具挑战性。GAN在非医学超分辨率任务中表现出色，但在4D Flow MRI中的应用尚未探索。

Method: 使用患者特异性脑血管in-silico模型生成合成图像，通过MR-true重建管道。实现专用GAN架构，评估三种对抗损失函数：Vanilla、Relativistic和Wasserstein GAN。

Result: 提出的GAN相比非对抗参考改善了近壁速度恢复（vNRMSE: 6.9% vs. 9.6%）。Wasserstein GAN表现出最佳稳定性和增量改进（vNRMSE: 6.9% vs. 7.2%），在低信噪比下优于生成器基线（vNRMSE: 8.7% vs. 10.7%）。

Conclusion: GAN-based超分辨率在增强4D Flow MRI方面具有潜力，特别是在具有挑战性的脑血管区域，但需要仔细选择对抗策略以确保训练稳定性。

Abstract: 4D Flow Magnetic Resonance Imaging (4D Flow MRI) enables non-invasive
quantification of blood flow and hemodynamic parameters. However, its clinical
application is limited by low spatial resolution and noise, particularly
affecting near-wall velocity measurements. Machine learning-based
super-resolution has shown promise in addressing these limitations, but
challenges remain, not least in recovering near-wall velocities. Generative
adversarial networks (GANs) offer a compelling solution, having demonstrated
strong capabilities in restoring sharp boundaries in non-medical
super-resolution tasks. Yet, their application in 4D Flow MRI remains
unexplored, with implementation challenged by known issues such as training
instability and non-convergence. In this study, we investigate GAN-based
super-resolution in 4D Flow MRI. Training and validation were conducted using
patient-specific cerebrovascular in-silico models, converted into synthetic
images via an MR-true reconstruction pipeline. A dedicated GAN architecture was
implemented and evaluated across three adversarial loss functions: Vanilla,
Relativistic, and Wasserstein. Our results demonstrate that the proposed GAN
improved near-wall velocity recovery compared to a non-adversarial reference
(vNRMSE: 6.9% vs. 9.6%); however, that implementation specifics are critical
for stable network training. While Vanilla and Relativistic GANs proved
unstable compared to generator-only training (vNRMSE: 8.1% and 7.8% vs. 7.2%),
a Wasserstein GAN demonstrated optimal stability and incremental improvement
(vNRMSE: 6.9% vs. 7.2%). The Wasserstein GAN further outperformed the
generator-only baseline at low SNR (vNRMSE: 8.7% vs. 10.7%). These findings
highlight the potential of GAN-based super-resolution in enhancing 4D Flow MRI,
particularly in challenging cerebrovascular regions, while emphasizing the need
for careful selection of adversarial strategies.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种轻量级半监督神经网络HessNet，用于脑部MRA血管分割，只需6000个参数但达到了最先进的分割精度，并创建了一个大规模的半手动注释数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前脑部MRA血管分割主要依靠手工注释或经典方法，精度不足，且缺乏公开的详细注释数据集，影响神经网络的发展。

Method: 提出HessNet，一种基于Hessian矩阵的半监督学习轻量级神经网络，仅有6000个参数，支持CPU运行，用于3D管状结构分割。

Result: 在最小训练数据集上达到了最先进的血管分割精度，并基于IXI数据集创建了包含200张图像的大规模半手动注释脑部血管数据集。

Conclusion: HessNet不仅提供了高精度的血管分割方案，还大大减轻了专家注释工作量，为医学形态分割领域做出了重要贡献。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of blood vessels in brain magnetic resonance
angiography (MRA) is essential for successful surgical procedures, such as
aneurysm repair or bypass surgery. Currently, annotation is primarily performed
through manual segmentation or classical methods, such as the Frangi filter,
which often lack sufficient accuracy. Neural networks have emerged as powerful
tools for medical image segmentation, but their development depends on
well-annotated training datasets. However, there is a notable lack of publicly
available MRA datasets with detailed brain vessel annotations.
  To address this gap, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning lightweight
neural network with Hessian matrices on board for 3D segmentation of complex
structures such as tubular structures, which we named HessNet. The solution is
a Hessian-based neural network with only 6000 parameters. HessNet can run on
the CPU and significantly reduces the resource requirements for training neural
networks. The accuracy of vessel segmentation on a minimal training dataset
reaches state-of-the-art results. It helps us create a large, semi-manually
annotated brain vessel dataset of brain MRA images based on the IXI dataset
(annotated 200 images). Annotation was performed by three experts under the
supervision of three neurovascular surgeons after applying HessNet. It provides
high accuracy of vessel segmentation and allows experts to focus only on the
most complex important cases. The dataset is available at

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种动态、不确定性感知的MRI采集框架，能够根据个体需求自动调整扫描时间，在保证诊断精度的同时显著减少扫描时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MRI加速方法使用固定的加速因子，要么扫描时间过长，要么图像质量不足。现有方法忽略了重建过程中的不确定性，无法为下游临床任务提供统计保证。

Method: 使用概率重建模型估计图像不确定性，通过保形预测转换为校准的置信区间。系统迭代采样k空间，更新重建并评估置信区间，当不确定性达到预定精度目标时自动终止扫描。

Result: 在膝关节和心脏MRI数据集上验证，相比固定协议减少了扫描时间，同时为最终图像的精度提供了正式的统计保证。

Conclusion: 该框架超越了固定加速因子，实现了患者特异性的采集，平衡了扫描效率与诊断置信度，是迈向个性化和资源高效MRI的关键一步。

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) offers unparalleled soft-tissue contrast but
is fundamentally limited by long acquisition times. While deep learning-based
accelerated MRI can dramatically shorten scan times, the reconstruction from
undersampled data introduces ambiguity resulting from an ill-posed problem with
infinitely many possible solutions that propagates to downstream clinical
tasks. This uncertainty is usually ignored during the acquisition process as
acceleration factors are often fixed a priori, resulting in scans that are
either unnecessarily long or of insufficient quality for a given clinical
endpoint. This work introduces a dynamic, uncertainty-aware acquisition
framework that adjusts scan time on a per-subject basis. Our method leverages a
probabilistic reconstruction model to estimate image uncertainty, which is then
propagated through a full analysis pipeline to a quantitative metric of
interest (e.g., patellar cartilage volume or cardiac ejection fraction). We use
conformal prediction to transform this uncertainty into a rigorous, calibrated
confidence interval for the metric. During acquisition, the system iteratively
samples k-space, updates the reconstruction, and evaluates the confidence
interval. The scan terminates automatically once the uncertainty meets a
user-predefined precision target. We validate our framework on both knee and
cardiac MRI datasets. Our results demonstrate that this adaptive approach
reduces scan times compared to fixed protocols while providing formal
statistical guarantees on the precision of the final image. This framework
moves beyond fixed acceleration factors, enabling patient-specific acquisitions
that balance scan efficiency with diagnostic confidence, a critical step
towards personalized and resource-efficient MRI.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 本研究通过信息级联范式分析9个主流大语言模型的社会从众行为，发现信息性影响是主要驱动因素，但不确定性会显著调节模型行为：低不确定性时保守处理，高不确定性时出现类似规范性影响的信号放大效应


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型融入协作团队，其社会从众性（倾向于与多数意见保持一致）成为关键问题。需要了解这种从众行为是源于信息性影响（理性利用群体线索）还是规范性影响（社会压力），以及不确定性如何调节这种平衡

Method: 采用行为经济学的信息级联范式，在医疗、法律、投资三个决策场景中评估9个领先的LLM，通过操纵信息不确定性（q = 0.667, 0.55, 0.70）来量化分析两种驱动因素

Result: 信息性影响是所有情境下模型行为的基础，准确性和置信度随证据强度一致上升。但不确定性显著调节：低中不确定性时表现为保守策略，系统性地低估所有证据源；高不确定性时出现关键转变，在信息处理基础上额外表现出类似规范性的放大效应，过度重视公共信号

Conclusion: LLM的社会从众行为主要由信息性影响驱动，但不确定性会戏剧性地调节这一机制，高不确定性条件下会出现类似人类规范性影响的信号放大行为，表明模型在处理不确定信息时可能采用启发式处理方式

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) integrate into collaborative teams, their
social conformity -- the tendency to align with majority opinions -- has
emerged as a key concern. In humans, conformity arises from informational
influence (rational use of group cues for accuracy) or normative influence
(social pressure for approval), with uncertainty moderating this balance by
shifting from purely analytical to heuristic processing. It remains unclear
whether these human psychological mechanisms apply to LLMs. This study adapts
the information cascade paradigm from behavioral economics to quantitatively
disentangle the two drivers to investigate the moderate effect. We evaluated
nine leading LLMs across three decision-making scenarios (medical, legal,
investment), manipulating information uncertainty (q = 0.667, 0.55, and 0.70,
respectively). Our results indicate that informational influence underpins the
models' behavior across all contexts, with accuracy and confidence consistently
rising with stronger evidence. However, this foundational mechanism is
dramatically modulated by uncertainty. In low-to-medium uncertainty scenarios,
this informational process is expressed as a conservative strategy, where LLMs
systematically underweight all evidence sources. In contrast, high uncertainty
triggers a critical shift: while still processing information, the models
additionally exhibit a normative-like amplification, causing them to overweight
public signals (beta > 1.55 vs. private beta = 0.81).

Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI) increasingly impacts professional practice,
there is a growing need to AI-related competencies into higher education
curricula. However, research on the implementation of AI education within study
programs remains limited and requires new forms of collaboration across
disciplines. This study addresses this gap and explores perspectives on
interdisciplinary curriculum development through the lens of different
stakeholders. In particular, we examine the case of curriculum development for
a novel undergraduate program in AI in engineering. The research uses a mixed
methods approach, combining quantitative curriculum mapping with qualitative
focus group interviews. In addition to assessing the alignment of the
curriculum with the targeted competencies, the study also examines the
perceived quality, consistency, practicality and effectiveness from both
academic and industry perspectives, as well as differences in perceptions
between educators who were involved in the development and those who were not.
The findings provide a practical understanding of the outcomes of
interdisciplinary AI curriculum development and contribute to a broader
understanding of how educator participation in curriculum development
influences perceptions of quality aspects. It also advances the field of AI
education by providing a reference point and insights for further
interdisciplinary curriculum developments in response to evolving industry

Conclusion: Hadamard可分解性受到深层代数约束，矩阵密度是强预测因子，可表达矩阵形成低维代数簇，揭示了矩阵分解的结构性规律。

Abstract: We computationally resolve an open problem concerning the expressibility of
$4 \times 4$ full-rank matrices as Hadamard products of two rank-2 matrices.
Through exhaustive search over $\mathbb{F}_2$, we identify 5,304
counterexamples among the 20,160 full-rank binary matrices (26.3\%). We verify
that these counterexamples remain valid over $\mathbb{Z}$ through sign
enumeration and provide strong numerical evidence for their validity over
$\mathbb{R}$.
  Remarkably, our analysis reveals that matrix density (number of ones) is
highly predictive of expressibility, achieving 95.7\% classification accuracy.
Using modern machine learning techniques, we discover that expressible matrices
lie on an approximately 10-dimensional variety within the 16-dimensional
ambient space, despite the naive parameter count of 24 (12 parameters each for
two $4 \times 4$ rank-2 matrices). This emergent low-dimensional structure
suggests deep algebraic constraints governing Hadamard factorizability.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to serve as a foundational
capability across the entire lifecycle of 6G networks, spanning design,
deployment, and operation. This article proposes a native AI-driven air
interface architecture built around two core characteristics: compression and
adaptation. On one hand, compression enables the system to understand and
extract essential semantic information from the source data, focusing on task
relevance rather than symbol-level accuracy. On the other hand, adaptation
allows the air interface to dynamically transmit semantic information across
diverse tasks, data types, and channel conditions, ensuring scalability and
robustness. This article first introduces the native AI-driven air interface
architecture, then discusses representative enabling methodologies, followed by
a case study on semantic communication in 6G non-terrestrial networks. Finally,
it presents a forward-looking discussion on the future of native AI in 6G,

Abstract: This paper studies an over-the-air federated edge learning (Air-FEEL) system
with integrated sensing, communication, and computation (ISCC), in which one
edge server coordinates multiple edge devices to wirelessly sense the objects
and use the sensing data to collaboratively train a machine learning model for
recognition tasks. In this system, over-the-air computation (AirComp) is
employed to enable one-shot model aggregation from edge devices. Under this
setup, we analyze the convergence behavior of the ISCC-enabled Air-FEEL in
terms of the loss function degradation, by particularly taking into account the
wireless sensing noise during the training data acquisition and the AirComp
distortions during the over-the-air model aggregation. The result theoretically
shows that sensing, communication, and computation compete for network
resources to jointly decide the convergence rate. Based on the analysis, we
design the ISCC parameters under the target of maximizing the loss function
degradation while ensuring the latency and energy budgets in each round. The
challenge lies on the tightly coupled processes of sensing, communication, and
computation among different devices. To tackle the challenge, we derive a
low-complexity ISCC algorithm by alternately optimizing the batch size control
and the network resource allocation. It is found that for each device, less
sensing power should be consumed if a larger batch of data samples is obtained
and vice versa. Besides, with a given batch size, the optimal computation speed
of one device is the minimum one that satisfies the latency constraint.
Numerical results based on a human motion recognition task verify the
theoretical convergence analysis and show that the proposed ISCC algorithm well
coordinates the batch size control and resource allocation among sensing,
communication, and computation to enhance the learning performance.

Conclusion: Forest U-Test是检测复杂性状中遗传和环境交互作用的有效工具，具有强大的统计性能和可复制性，为高维遗传关联研究提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: Variations in complex traits are influenced by multiple genetic variants,
environmental risk factors, and their interactions. Though substantial progress
has been made in identifying single genetic variants associated with complex
traits, detecting the gene-gene and gene-environment interactions remains a
great challenge. When a large number of genetic variants and environmental risk
factors are involved, searching for interactions is limited to pair-wise
interactions due to the exponentially increased feature space and computational
intensity. Alternatively, recursive partitioning approaches, such as random
forests, have gained popularity in high-dimensional genetic association
studies. In this article, we propose a U-Statistic-based random forest
approach, referred to as Forest U-Test, for genetic association studies with
quantitative traits. Through simulation studies, we showed that the Forest
U-Test outperformed existing methods. The proposed method was also applied to
study Cannabis Dependence CD, using three independent datasets from the Study
of Addiction: Genetics and Environment. A significant joint association was
detected with an empirical p-value less than 0.001. The finding was also

Abstract: Understanding which genes control which traits in an organism remains one of
the central challenges in biology. Despite significant advances in data
collection technology, our ability to map genes to traits is still limited.
This genome-to-phenome (G2P) challenge spans several problem domains, including
plant breeding, and requires models capable of reasoning over high-dimensional,
heterogeneous, and biologically structured data. Currently, however, many
datasets solely capture genetic information or solely capture phenotype
information. Additionally, phenotype data is very heterogeneous, which many
datasets do not fully capture. The critical drawback is that these datasets are
not integrated, that is, they do not link with each other to describe the same
biological specimens. This limits machine learning models' ability to be
informed on the various aspects of these specimens, impacting the breadth of
correlations learned, and therefore their ability to make more accurate
predictions. To address this gap, we present the Arabidopsis Genomics-Phenomics
(AGP) Dataset, a curated multi-modal dataset linking gene expression profiles
with phenotypic trait measurements in Arabidopsis thaliana, a model organism in
plant biology. AGP supports tasks such as phenotype prediction and
interpretable graph learning. In addition, we benchmark conventional regression
and explanatory baselines, including a biologically-informed hypergraph
baseline, to validate gene-trait associations. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first dataset that provides multi-modal gene information and
heterogeneous trait or phenotype data for the same Arabidopsis thaliana
specimens. With AGP, we aim to foster the research community towards accurately
understanding the connection between genotypes and phenotypes using gene
information, higher-order gene pairings, and trait data from several sources.

Abstract: Recommender systems for niche and dynamic communities face persistent
challenges from data sparsity, cold start users and items, and privacy
constraints. Traditional collaborative filtering and content-based approaches
underperform in these settings, either requiring invasive user data or failing
when preference histories are absent. We present DeepNaniNet, a deep neural
recommendation framework that addresses these challenges through an inductive
graph-based architecture combining user-item interactions, item-item relations,
and rich textual review embeddings derived from BERT. Our design enables cold
start recommendations without profile mining, using a novel "content basket"

users. We introduce AnimeULike, a new dataset of 10,000 anime titles and 13,000
users, to evaluate performance in realistic scenarios with high proportions of
guest or low-activity users. DeepNaniNet achieves state-of-the-art cold start
results on the CiteULike benchmark, matches DropoutNet in user recall without
performance degradation for out-of-matrix users, and outperforms Weighted

Conclusion: 该研究提出了结合变分量子计算和深度学习的新框架，在真实数据集上表现优异，在噪声环境中性能稳定，为推荐系统的未来发展提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Quantum computing, with its ability to do exponentially faster computation
compared to classical systems, has found novel applications in various fields
such as machine learning and recommendation systems. Quantum Machine Learning
(QML), which integrates quantum computing with machine learning techniques,
presents powerful new tools for data processing and pattern recognition. This
paper proposes a hybrid recommendation system that combines Quantum Hopfield
Associative Memory (QHAM) with deep neural networks to improve the extraction
and classification on the MovieLens 1M dataset. User archetypes are clustered
into multiple unique groups using the K-Means algorithm and converted into
polar patterns through the encoder's activation function. These polar patterns
are then integrated into the variational QHAM-based hybrid recommendation
model. The system was trained using the MSE loss over 35 epochs in an ideal
environment, achieving an ROC value of 0.9795, an accuracy of 0.8841, and an
F-1 Score of 0.8786. Trained with the same number of epochs in a noisy
environment using a custom Qiskit AER noise model incorporating bit-flip and
readout errors with the same probabilities as in real quantum hardware, it
achieves an ROC of 0.9177, an accuracy of 0.8013, and an F-1 Score equal to
0.7866, demonstrating consistent performance.
  Additionally, we were able to optimize the qubit overhead present in previous
QHAM architectures by efficiently updating only one random targeted qubit. This
research presents a novel framework that combines variational quantum computing
with deep learning, capable of dealing with real-world datasets with comparable
performance compared to purely classical counterparts. Additionally, the model
can perform similarly well in noisy configurations, showcasing a steady
performance and proposing a promising direction for future usage in
recommendation systems.

TL;DR: FSAP是一种新型黑盒攻击框架，利用大语言模型的上下文学习能力生成高排名对抗文档，无需梯度访问或模型内部操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经排序模型虽然有效但易受对抗攻击，现有方法依赖token级扰动或手动重写，需要更高效、隐蔽的攻击方式。

Method: 通过少样本提示生成对抗文档，使用FSAP-IntraQ（同查询有害示例）和FSAP-InterQ（跨查询模式迁移）两种模式。

Result: 在TREC 2020和2021健康错误信息数据集上，FSAP生成的文档持续超越真实准确文档的排名，具有强立场对齐和低检测性。

Conclusion: FSAP构成了对神经检索系统的现实且可扩展的威胁，能有效泛化到专有和开源大语言模型。

Abstract: While neural ranking models (NRMs) have shown high effectiveness, they remain
susceptible to adversarial manipulation. In this work, we introduce Few-Shot
Adversarial Prompting (FSAP), a novel black-box attack framework that leverages
the in-context learning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to
generate high-ranking adversarial documents. Unlike previous approaches that
rely on token-level perturbations or manual rewriting of existing documents,
FSAP formulates adversarial attacks entirely through few-shot prompting,
requiring no gradient access or internal model instrumentation. By conditioning
the LLM on a small support set of previously observed harmful examples, FSAP
synthesizes grammatically fluent and topically coherent documents that subtly
embed false or misleading information and rank competitively against authentic
content. We instantiate FSAP in two modes: FSAP-IntraQ, which leverages harmful
examples from the same query to enhance topic fidelity, and FSAP-InterQ, which
enables broader generalization by transferring adversarial patterns across
unrelated queries. Our experiments on the TREC 2020 and 2021 Health
Misinformation Tracks, using four diverse neural ranking models, reveal that
FSAP-generated documents consistently outrank credible, factually accurate
documents. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that these adversarial
outputs exhibit strong stance alignment and low detectability, posing a
realistic and scalable threat to neural retrieval systems. FSAP also
effectively generalizes across both proprietary and open-source LLMs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了COSETTE对比标记化方法和MARIUS轻量级生成模型，解决了生成式推荐系统中缺乏协同信号和编码器-解码器架构效率低下的问题，显著缩小了与ID基模型的性能差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式推荐系统在实践中往往表现不如传统的ID基模型（如SASRec），主要存在两个关键限制：项目标记化中缺乏协同信号，以及编码器-解码器架构的效率低下。

Method: 1. COSETTE：对比标记化方法，将协同信息直接整合到学习到的项目表示中，联合优化内容重建和推荐相关性
2. MARIUS：轻量级音频启发式生成模型，将时间线建模与项目解码解耦

Result: 在标准序列推荐基准测试中，该方法缩小甚至消除了生成式模型与现代ID基模型之间的性能差距，同时保持了生成范式的优势。

Conclusion: 通过引入协同感知的标记化和高效的生成架构，成功解决了生成式推荐系统的关键限制，为实现高性能的生成式推荐系统提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent work has explored generative recommender systems as an alternative to
traditional ID-based models, reframing item recommendation as a sequence
generation task over discrete item tokens. While promising, such methods often
underperform in practice compared to well-tuned ID-based baselines like SASRec.
In this paper, we identify two key limitations holding back generative
approaches: the lack of collaborative signal in item tokenization, and
inefficiencies in the commonly used encoder-decoder architecture. To address
these issues, we introduce COSETTE, a contrastive tokenization method that
integrates collaborative information directly into the learned item
representations, jointly optimizing for both content reconstruction and
recommendation relevance. Additionally, we propose MARIUS, a lightweight,
audio-inspired generative model that decouples timeline modeling from item
decoding. MARIUS reduces inference cost while improving recommendation
accuracy. Experiments on standard sequential recommendation benchmarks show
that our approach narrows, or even eliminates, the performance gap between
generative and modern ID-based models, while retaining the benefits of the
generative paradigm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推荐系统依赖数值评分或完整排名，但评分存在行为偏差且主观，获取完整排名不切实际，需要更准确高效的用户偏好学习方法

Method: 基于Plackett-Luce概率框架的成对比较偏好模型，采用效用驱动的主动采样策略选择最能提升最终推荐效用的查询

Result: 在电影推荐和大学招生候选选择两个实验中，该框架展现出更高的准确性、数据效率和用户中心性

Conclusion: 该框架为个性化排名提供了更准确、数据高效且用户中心的范式，能够显式对齐系统目标与应用场景的高质量结果定义

Abstract: Recommender systems play a critical role in enhancing user experience by
providing personalized suggestions based on user preferences. Traditional
approaches often rely on explicit numerical ratings or assume access to fully
ranked lists of items. However, ratings frequently fail to capture true
preferences due to users' behavioral biases and subjective interpretations of
rating scales, while eliciting full rankings is demanding and impractical. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a generalized utility-based framework
that learns preferences from simple and intuitive pairwise comparisons. Our
approach is model-agnostic and designed to optimize for arbitrary,
task-specific utility functions, allowing the system's objective to be
explicitly aligned with the definition of a high-quality outcome in any given
application. A central contribution of our work is a novel utility-based active
sampling strategy for preference elicitation. This method selects queries that
are expected to provide the greatest improvement to the utility of the final
recommended outcome. We ground our preference model in the probabilistic
Plackett-Luce framework for pairwise data. To demonstrate the versatility of
our approach, we present two distinct experiments: first, an implementation
using matrix factorization for a classic movie recommendation task, and second,
an implementation using a neural network for a complex candidate selection
scenario in university admissions. Experimental results demonstrate that our
framework provides a more accurate, data-efficient, and user-centric paradigm
for personalized ranking.

Abstract: We present the first systematic investigation of graph reordering effects for
graph-based Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) on a GPU. While
graph-based ANNS has become the dominant paradigm for modern AI applications,
recent approaches focus on algorithmic innovations while neglecting memory
layout considerations that significantly affect execution time. Our unified
evaluation framework enables comprehensive evaluation of diverse reordering
strategies across different graph indices through a graph adapter that converts
arbitrary graph topologies into a common representation and a GPU-optimized
graph traversal engine. We conduct a comprehensive analysis across diverse
datasets and state-of-the-art graph indices, introducing analysis metrics that
quantify the relationship between structural properties and memory layout
effectiveness. Our GPU-targeted reordering achieves up to 15$\%$ QPS
improvements while preserving search accuracy, demonstrating that memory layout
optimization operates orthogonally to existing algorithmic innovations. We will
release all code upon publication to facilitate reproducibility and foster
further research.

Conclusion: 动机驱动的语义建模是解决推荐系统冷启动问题的有效方法，M-LLM³REC框架为此提供了创新解决方案

Abstract: Recommendation systems have been essential for both user experience and
platform efficiency by alleviating information overload and supporting
decision-making. Traditional methods, i.e., content-based filtering,
collaborative filtering, and deep learning, have achieved impressive results in
recommendation systems. However, the cold-start and sparse-data scenarios are
still challenging to deal with. Existing solutions either generate
pseudo-interaction sequence, which often introduces redundant or noisy signals,
or rely heavily on semantic similarity, overlooking dynamic shifts in user
motivation. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel
recommendation framework, termed M-$LLM^3$REC, which leverages large language
models for deep motivational signal extraction from limited user interactions.
M-$LLM^3$REC comprises three integrated modules: the Motivation-Oriented
Profile Extractor (MOPE), Motivation-Oriented Trait Encoder (MOTE), and
Motivational Alignment Recommender (MAR). By emphasizing motivation-driven
semantic modeling, M-$LLM^3$REC demonstrates robust, personalized, and
generalizable recommendations, particularly boosting performance in cold-start
situations in comparison with the state-of-the-art frameworks.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a standard framework for
knowledge-intensive NLP tasks, combining large language models (LLMs) with
document retrieval from external corpora. Despite its widespread use, most RAG
pipelines continue to treat retrieval and reasoning as isolated components,
retrieving documents once and then generating answers without further
interaction. This static design often limits performance on complex tasks that
require iterative evidence gathering or high-precision retrieval. Recent work
in both the information retrieval (IR) and NLP communities has begun to close
this gap by introducing adaptive retrieval and ranking methods that incorporate
feedback. In this survey, we present a structured overview of advanced
retrieval and ranking mechanisms that integrate such feedback. We categorize
feedback signals based on their source and role in improving the query,
retrieved context, or document pool. By consolidating these developments, we
aim to bridge IR and NLP perspectives and highlight retrieval as a dynamic,
learnable component of end-to-end RAG systems.

Result: 离线和在线A/B测试显示MMQ有效统一了多模态协同、特异性和行为适应性

Conclusion: MMQ为生成式检索和判别式排序任务提供了可扩展的通用解决方案

Abstract: Recommender systems traditionally represent items using unique identifiers
(ItemIDs), but this approach struggles with large, dynamic item corpora and
sparse long-tail data, limiting scalability and generalization. Semantic IDs,
derived from multimodal content such as text and images, offer a promising
alternative by mapping items into a shared semantic space, enabling knowledge
transfer and improving recommendations for new or rare items. However, existing
methods face two key challenges: (1) balancing cross-modal synergy with
modality-specific uniqueness, and (2) bridging the semantic-behavioral gap,
where semantic representations may misalign with actual user preferences. To
address these challenges, we propose Multimodal Mixture-of-Quantization (MMQ),
a two-stage framework that trains a novel multimodal tokenizer. First, a
shared-specific tokenizer leverages a multi-expert architecture with
modality-specific and modality-shared experts, using orthogonal regularization
to capture comprehensive multimodal information. Second, behavior-aware
fine-tuning dynamically adapts semantic IDs to downstream recommendation
objectives while preserving modality information through a multimodal
reconstruction loss. Extensive offline experiments and online A/B tests
demonstrate that MMQ effectively unifies multimodal synergy, specificity, and
behavioral adaptation, providing a scalable and versatile solution for both
generative retrieval and discriminative ranking tasks.

Abstract: Continual learning is motivated by the need to adapt to real-world dynamics
in tasks and data distribution while mitigating catastrophic forgetting.
Despite significant advances in continual learning techniques, the theoretical
understanding of their generalization performance lags behind. This paper
examines the theoretical properties of continual ridge regression in
high-dimensional linear models, where the dimension is proportional to the
sample size in each task. Using random matrix theory, we derive exact
expressions of the asymptotic prediction risk, thereby enabling the
characterization of three evaluation metrics of generalization performance in
continual learning: average risk, backward transfer, and forward transfer.
Furthermore, we present the theoretical risk curves to illustrate the trends in
these evaluation metrics throughout the continual learning process. Our
analysis reveals several intriguing phenomena in the risk curves, demonstrating
how model specifications influence the generalization performance. Simulation
studies are conducted to validate our theoretical findings.

Abstract: The RDD (regression discontinuity design) is a widely used framework for
identification and estimation of causal effects at a cutoff of a single running
variable. Practical settings, in particular those encountered in production
systems, often involve decision-making defined by multiple thresholds and
criteria. Common MRD (multi-score RDD) approaches transform these to a
one-dimensional design, to employ identification and estimation results.
However, this practice can introduce non-compliant behavior. We develop
theoretical tools to identify and reduce some of this "fuzziness" when
estimating the cutoff-effect on compliers of sub-rules. We provide a sound
definition and categorization of unit behavior types for multi-dimensional
cutoff-rules, extending existing categorizations. We identify conditions for
the existence and identification of the cutoff-effect on complier in multiple
dimensions, and specify when identification remains stable after excluding
nevertaker and alwaystaker. Further, we investigate how decomposing
cutoff-rules into simpler parts alters the unit behavior. This allows
identification and removal of non-compliant units potentially improving
estimates. We validate our framework on simulated and real-world data from
opto-electronic semiconductor manufacturing. Our empirical results demonstrate
the usability for refining production policies. Particularly we show that our
approach decreases the estimation variance, highlighting the practical value of
the MRD framework in manufacturing.

Abstract: X-ray phase contrast imaging significantly improves the visualization of
structures with weak or uniform absorption, broadening its applications across
a wide range of scientific disciplines. Propagation-based phase contrast is
particularly suitable for time- or dose-critical in vivo/in situ/operando
(tomography) experiments because it requires only a single intensity
measurement. However, the phase information of the wave field is lost during
the measurement and must be recovered. Conventional algebraic and iterative
methods often rely on specific approximations or boundary conditions that may
not be met by many samples or experimental setups. In addition, they require
manual tuning of reconstruction parameters by experts, making them less
adaptable for complex or variable conditions. Here we present a self-learning
approach for solving the inverse problem of phase retrieval in the near-field
regime of Fresnel theory using a single intensity measurement (hologram). A
physics-informed generative adversarial network is employed to reconstruct both
the phase and absorbance of the unpropagated wave field in the sample plane
from a single hologram. Unlike most deep learning approaches for phase
retrieval, our approach does not require paired, unpaired, or simulated
training data. This significantly broadens the applicability of our approach,
as acquiring or generating suitable training data remains a major challenge due
to the wide variability in sample types and experimental configurations. The
algorithm demonstrates robust and consistent performance across diverse imaging
conditions and sample types, delivering quantitative, high-quality
reconstructions for both simulated data and experimental datasets acquired at
beamline P05 at PETRA III (DESY, Hamburg), operated by Helmholtz-Zentrum
Hereon. Furthermore, it enables the simultaneous retrieval of both phase and
absorption information.

Motivation: 探索人类大脑能够进行符号推理而大多数其他动物不能的原因，寻找实现符号思维的最小神经机制要求。

Method: 设计了17个通用模拟实验，测试具有和不具有多位置谓词和结构映射能力的认知架构在各种任务中的表现，确保任务不能通过诊断特征完成。

Conclusion: 这些发现有助于理解人类大脑如何产生符号思维，揭示了生物智能与机器学习方法的差异，并对生物启发的人工智能具有重要启示。

Abstract: What is it about human brains that allows us to reason symbolically whereas
most other animals cannot? There is evidence that dynamic binding, the ability
to combine neurons into groups on the fly, is necessary for symbolic thought,
but there is also evidence that it is not sufficient. We propose that two kinds
of hierarchical integration (integration of multiple role-bindings into
multiplace predicates, and integration of multiple correspondences into
structure mappings) are minimal requirements, on top of basic dynamic binding,
to realize symbolic thought. We tested this hypothesis in a systematic
collection of 17 simulations that explored the ability of cognitive
architectures with and without the capacity for multi-place predicates and
structure mapping to perform various kinds of tasks. The simulations were as
generic as possible, in that no task could be performed based on any diagnostic
features, depending instead on the capacity for multi-place predicates and
structure mapping. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that, along
with dynamic binding, multi-place predicates and structure mapping are minimal
requirements for basic symbolic thought. These results inform our understanding
of how human brains give rise to symbolic thought and speak to the differences
between biological intelligence, which tends to generalize broadly from very
few training examples, and modern approaches to machine learning, which
typically require millions or billions of training examples. The results we
report also have important implications for bio-inspired artificial
intelligence.

*Vojtech Kovarik,Eric Olav Chen,Sami Petersen,Alexis Ghersengorin,Vincent Conitzer*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 该立场论文主张AI测试评估需要考虑AI系统的战略推理能力，并建议使用博弈论分析来改进评估设计


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI评估方法可能无法捕捉AI系统在部署时的战略行为，因为AI系统可能会理解评估环境并进行策略性应对

Method: 通过分析现有AI系统案例、回顾相关研究，以及对风格化评估场景进行形式化战略分析

Result: 提供了支持这两个主张的证据，并提出了多个研究方向

Conclusion: AI评估需要纳入战略推理考量，博弈论分析可为评估设计提供重要见解

Abstract: This position paper argues for two claims regarding AI testing and
evaluation. First, to remain informative about deployment behaviour,
evaluations need account for the possibility that AI systems understand their
circumstances and reason strategically. Second, game-theoretic analysis can
inform evaluation design by formalising and scrutinising the reasoning in
evaluation-based safety cases. Drawing on examples from existing AI systems, a
review of relevant research, and formal strategic analysis of a stylised
evaluation scenario, we present evidence for these claims and motivate several
research directions.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: DeCoDi是一种针对扩散模型的去偏推理方法，通过改变推理过程避免潜在空间中的偏见概念区域，无需复杂干预或大量计算开销，有效改善生成图像的多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度学习去偏方法通常需要复杂或计算密集的干预，而DeCoDi旨在仅改变推理过程，使其对更广泛的从业者更加易用。

Method: 改变扩散过程以避免潜在维度中的偏见概念区域，该方法可应用于任何基于扩散的图像生成模型，且计算开销可忽略不计。

Result: 通过对护士、消防员和CEO等概念进行性别、种族和年龄去偏，人工评估1200张生成图像显示方法有效。GPT4o自动评估与人工评估无显著统计差异，评估者间一致性可靠。

Conclusion: DeCoDi方法具有显著改善基于扩散的文本到图像生成模型生成图像多样性的潜力，且不影响图像质量。

Abstract: We propose DeCoDi, a debiasing procedure for text-to-image diffusion-based
models that changes the inference procedure, does not significantly change
image quality, has negligible compute overhead, and can be applied in any
diffusion-based image generation model. DeCoDi changes the diffusion process to
avoid latent dimension regions of biased concepts. While most deep learning
debiasing methods require complex or compute-intensive interventions, our
method is designed to change only the inference procedure. Therefore, it is
more accessible to a wide range of practitioners. We show the effectiveness of
the method by debiasing for gender, ethnicity, and age for the concepts of
nurse, firefighter, and CEO. Two distinct human evaluators manually inspect
1,200 generated images. Their evaluation results provide evidence that our
method is effective in mitigating biases based on gender, ethnicity, and age.
We also show that an automatic bias evaluation performed by the GPT4o is not
significantly statistically distinct from a human evaluation. Our evaluation
shows promising results, with reliable levels of agreement between evaluators
and more coverage of protected attributes. Our method has the potential to
significantly improve the diversity of images it generates by diffusion-based
text-to-image generative models.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 本文首次提出离散虚拟完整约束(DVHC)方法，用于解决魔鬼棒垂直面螺旋桨运动的脉冲控制问题，通过离散零动力学实现轨道稳定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 魔鬼棒的螺旋桨运动控制是欠驱动机器人杂耍的一个新问题，此前文献中尚未研究过。需要开发新的控制方法来处理脉冲输入下的轨道稳定问题。

Method: 引入离散虚拟完整约束(DVHC)概念，在脉冲输入时刻指定质心位置与方向角的关系，建立离散零动力学(DZD)，并设计基于脉冲控制庞加莱映射的轨道稳定控制器。

Result: 通过仿真验证了所提方法在轨迹设计和稳定化方面的有效性，在连续脉冲输入极限情况下可退化为连续力控制问题。

Conclusion: DVHC方法为脉冲控制下的欠驱动系统轨道稳定提供了有效解决方案，扩展了虚拟完整约束理论在离散时间系统中的应用。

Abstract: The control problem of realizing propeller motion of a devil-stick in the
vertical plane using impulsive forces applied normal to the stick is
considered. This problem is an example of underactuated robotic juggling and
has not been considered in the literature before. Inspired by virtual holonomic
constraints, the concept of discrete virtual holonomic constraints (DVHC) is
introduced for the first time to solve this orbital stabilization problem. At
the discrete instants when impulsive inputs are applied, the location of the
center-of-mass of the devil-stick is specified in terms of its orientation
angle. This yields the discrete zero dynamics (DZD), which provides conditions
for stable propeller motion. In the limiting case, when the rotation angle
between successive applications of impulsive inputs is chosen to be arbitrarily
small, the problem reduces to that of propeller motion under continuous
forcing. A controller that enforces the DVHC, and an orbit stabilizing
controller based on the impulse controlled Poincar\'e map approach are
presented. The efficacy of the approach to trajectory design and stabilization
is validated through simulations.

Result: 结合结构和功能特征的随机森林模型表现最佳(AUC=0.87)，识别出6个关键预测因子，包括下方位MRW、RNFL厚度等

Conclusion: 结合视盘结构和视野功能参数显著提高了PACG进展风险的分类准确性，下方位视盘特征是最重要的预测因子

Abstract: Purpose: To classify eyes as slow or fast glaucoma progressors in patients
with primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) using an integrated approach
combining optic nerve head (ONH) structural features and sector-based visual
field (VF) functional parameters. Methods: PACG patients with >5 reliable VF
tests over >5 years were included. Progression was assessed in Zeiss Forum,
with baseline VF within six months of OCT. Fast progression was VFI decline
<-2.0% per year; slow progression >-2.0% per year. OCT volumes were
AI-segmented to extract 31 ONH parameters. The Glaucoma Hemifield Test defined
five regions per hemifield, aligned with RNFL distribution. Mean sensitivity
per region was combined with structural parameters to train ML classifiers.
Multiple models were tested, and SHAP identified key predictors. Main outcome
measures: Classification of slow versus fast progressors using combined
structural and functional data. Results: We analyzed 451 eyes from 299
patients. Mean VFI progression was -0.92% per year; 369 eyes progressed slowly
and 82 rapidly. The Random Forest model combining structural and functional
features achieved the best performance (AUC = 0.87, 2000 Monte Carlo
iterations). SHAP identified six key predictors: inferior MRW, inferior and
inferior-temporal RNFL thickness, nasal-temporal LC curvature, superior nasal
VF sensitivity, and inferior RNFL and GCL+IPL thickness. Models using only
structural or functional features performed worse with AUC of 0.82 and 0.78,
respectively. Conclusions: Combining ONH structural and VF functional
parameters significantly improves classification of progression risk in PACG.
Inferior ONH features, MRW and RNFL thickness, were the most predictive,
highlighting the critical role of ONH morphology in monitoring disease
progression.

TL;DR: 本文提出使用对抗性随机森林(ARF)生成流行病学合成数据，并通过复制6项流行病学研究验证了该方法能可靠重现原始研究结果，特别是在降低维度和预推导变量后效果更佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成式AI合成数据方法存在质量有限、计算需求高、非专家使用复杂等问题，且评估策略往往不能直接反映统计效用。需要验证合成数据是否能可靠重现流行病学研究的关键发现。

Method: 使用对抗性随机森林(ARF)合成表格型流行病学数据，复制6项已发表研究的统计分析，比较原始结果与合成结果，并评估维度和变量复杂度对合成质量的影响。

Result: 所有复制研究中，多次合成数据重复的结果与原始发现一致。即使在样本量-维度比较低的数据集上，各种描述性和推断性分析的结果都与原始结果高度匹配。降低维度和预推导变量进一步提高了结果的质量和稳定性。

Conclusion: ARF是一种高效便捷的流行病学数据合成方法，能够可靠地重现原始研究结果，特别是在优化数据维度后表现更佳，为解决流行病学实践挑战提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence for synthetic data generation holds
substantial potential to address practical challenges in epidemiology. However,
many current methods suffer from limited quality, high computational demands,
and complexity for non-experts. Furthermore, common evaluation strategies for
synthetic data often fail to directly reflect statistical utility. Against this
background, a critical underexplored question is whether synthetic data can
reliably reproduce key findings from epidemiological research. We propose the
use of adversarial random forests (ARF) as an efficient and convenient method
for synthesizing tabular epidemiological data. To evaluate its performance, we
replicated statistical analyses from six epidemiological publications and
compared original with synthetic results. These publications cover blood
pressure, anthropometry, myocardial infarction, accelerometry, loneliness, and
diabetes, based on data from the German National Cohort (NAKO
Gesundheitsstudie), the Bremen STEMI Registry U45 Study, and the Guelph Family
Health Study. Additionally, we assessed the impact of dimensionality and
variable complexity on synthesis quality by limiting datasets to variables
relevant for individual analyses, including necessary derivations. Across all
replicated original studies, results from multiple synthetic data replications
consistently aligned with original findings. Even for datasets with relatively
low sample size-to-dimensionality ratios, the replication outcomes closely
matched the original results across various descriptive and inferential
analyses. Reducing dimensionality and pre-deriving variables further enhanced
both quality and stability of the results.

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: Equi-mRNA是首个基于等变性的mRNA语言模型，通过编码同义密码子的对称性结构，在表达预测和序列生成任务中显著优于传统基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: mRNA治疗和合成生物学的重要性日益增长，需要能够捕捉同义密码子使用潜在结构的模型，现有方法未能充分建模遗传密码固有的对称性关系。

Method: 引入等变mRNA语言模型，将同义密码子对称性编码为2D特殊正交矩阵(SO(2))的循环子群，结合群论先验、等变损失和对称感知池化。

Result: 在下游属性预测任务中准确率提升约10%，序列生成任务中mRNA构建体的真实性提高4倍，功能属性保持能力提升28%。

Conclusion: Equi-mRNA为mRNA建模建立了新的生物学原则范式，对下一代治疗药物的设计具有重要影响。

Abstract: The growing importance of mRNA therapeutics and synthetic biology highlights
the need for models that capture the latent structure of synonymous codon
(different triplets encoding the same amino acid) usage, which subtly modulates
translation efficiency and gene expression. While recent efforts incorporate
codon-level inductive biases through auxiliary objectives, they often fall
short of explicitly modeling the structured relationships that arise from the
genetic code's inherent symmetries. We introduce Equi-mRNA, the first
codon-level equivariant mRNA language model that explicitly encodes synonymous
codon symmetries as cyclic subgroups of 2D Special Orthogonal matrix (SO(2)).
By combining group-theoretic priors with an auxiliary equivariance loss and
symmetry-aware pooling, Equi-mRNA learns biologically grounded representations
that outperform vanilla baselines across multiple axes. On downstream
property-prediction tasks including expression, stability, and riboswitch
switching Equi-mRNA delivers up to approximately 10% improvements in accuracy.
In sequence generation, it produces mRNA constructs that are up to
approximately 4x more realistic under Frechet BioDistance metrics and
approximately 28% better preserve functional properties compared to vanilla
baseline. Interpretability analyses further reveal that learned codon-rotation
distributions recapitulate known GC-content biases and tRNA abundance patterns,
offering novel insights into codon usage. Equi-mRNA establishes a new
biologically principled paradigm for mRNA modeling, with significant
implications for the design of next-generation therapeutics.

Motivation: 随着MLaaS平台的普及，模型提取攻击成为严重威胁，需要系统性的研究和防御策略来保护知识产权和系统安全。

Method: 提出新的分类法，根据攻击机制、防御方法和计算环境对MEAs进行分类，并评估各种攻击技术的有效性和现有防御的挑战。

Conclusion: 该综述为AI安全和隐私领域的研究者、从业者和政策制定者提供了重要参考，并指出了未来研究的有前景方向。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models have significantly grown in complexity and
utility, driving advances across multiple domains. However, substantial
computational resources and specialized expertise have historically restricted
their wide adoption. Machine-Learning-as-a-Service (MLaaS) platforms have
addressed these barriers by providing scalable, convenient, and affordable
access to sophisticated ML models through user-friendly APIs. While this
accessibility promotes widespread use of advanced ML capabilities, it also
introduces vulnerabilities exploited through Model Extraction Attacks (MEAs).
Recent studies have demonstrated that adversaries can systematically replicate
a target model's functionality by interacting with publicly exposed interfaces,
posing threats to intellectual property, privacy, and system security. In this
paper, we offer a comprehensive survey of MEAs and corresponding defense
strategies. We propose a novel taxonomy that classifies MEAs according to
attack mechanisms, defense approaches, and computing environments. Our analysis
covers various attack techniques, evaluates their effectiveness, and highlights
challenges faced by existing defenses, particularly the critical trade-off
between preserving model utility and ensuring security. We further assess MEAs
within different computing paradigms and discuss their technical, ethical,
legal, and societal implications, along with promising directions for future
research. This systematic survey aims to serve as a valuable reference for
researchers, practitioners, and policymakers engaged in AI security and
privacy. Additionally, we maintain an online repository continuously updated

Motivation: MoE架构通过动态路由实现计算效率，但这种输入依赖的激活模式在硬件层面留下了可被利用的时空痕迹，构成了新的隐私攻击面。

Method: 提出了四种新型架构侧信道：CPU上的缓存占用通道和页出重加载，GPU上的性能计数器和TLB驱逐重加载，并基于这些漏洞设计了四种隐私攻击方法。

Result: 成功在基于MoE的大型语言模型和视觉语言模型上实现了提示推断攻击、响应重构攻击、视觉推断攻击和视觉重构攻击，证明了严重的隐私泄露风险。

Conclusion: 这是首个针对现代Transformer中流行MoE结构的运行时架构级安全分析，揭示了严重的安全隐私威胁，呼吁在开发高效大规模AI服务时需要及时有效的防护措施。

Abstract: The transformer architecture has become a cornerstone of modern AI, fueling
remarkable progress across applications in natural language processing,
computer vision, and multimodal learning. As these models continue to scale
explosively for performance, implementation efficiency remains a critical
challenge. Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures, selectively activating
specialized subnetworks (experts), offer a unique balance between model
accuracy and computational cost. However, the adaptive routing in MoE
architectures, where input tokens are dynamically directed to specialized
experts based on their semantic meaning inadvertently opens up a new attack
surface for privacy breaches. These input-dependent activation patterns leave
distinctive temporal and spatial traces in hardware execution, which
adversaries could exploit to deduce sensitive user data. In this work, we
propose MoEcho, discovering a side channel analysis based attack surface that
compromises user privacy on MoE based systems. Specifically, in MoEcho, we
introduce four novel architectural side channels on different computing
platforms, including Cache Occupancy Channels and Pageout+Reload on CPUs, and
Performance Counter and TLB Evict+Reload on GPUs, respectively. Exploiting
these vulnerabilities, we propose four attacks that effectively breach user
privacy in large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs) based
on MoE architectures: Prompt Inference Attack, Response Reconstruction Attack,
Visual Inference Attack, and Visual Reconstruction Attack. MoEcho is the first
runtime architecture level security analysis of the popular MoE structure
common in modern transformers, highlighting a serious security and privacy
threat and calling for effective and timely safeguards when harnessing MoE
based models for developing efficient large scale AI services.

TL;DR: 本文提出RAGAN攻击框架，利用多模态基础模型的上下文学习能力生成高质量虚假用户配置文件，提升推荐系统的数据投毒攻击效果和隐蔽性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推荐系统易受数据投毒攻击，但现有方法生成的虚假评论质量差，影响攻击效果和隐蔽性。攻击者在黑盒系统中需要具有可迁移性的配置文件。

Method: 使用多模态基础模型的上下文学习能力，结合演示检索算法和文本风格转换策略，通过jailbreaker、instructional agent和guardian协同优化生成高质量虚假配置文件。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上的实验表明，RAGAN实现了最先进的中毒攻击性能，生成的配置文件具有更好的可迁移性和隐蔽性。

Conclusion: RAGAN框架通过提升虚假评论质量，有效增强了推荐系统数据投毒攻击的效果，为评估推荐系统鲁棒性提供了新方法。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that recommender systems (RSs) are highly
vulnerable to data poisoning attacks, where malicious actors inject fake user
profiles, including a group of well-designed fake ratings, to manipulate
recommendations. Due to security and privacy constraints in practice, attackers
typically possess limited knowledge of the victim system and thus need to craft
profiles that have transferability across black-box RSs. To maximize the attack
impact, the profiles often remains imperceptible. However, generating such
high-quality profiles with the restricted resources is challenging. Some works
suggest incorporating fake textual reviews to strengthen the profiles; yet, the
poor quality of the reviews largely undermines the attack effectiveness and
imperceptibility under the practical setting.
  To tackle the above challenges, in this paper, we propose to enhance the
quality of the review text by harnessing in-context learning (ICL) capabilities
of multimodal foundation models. To this end, we introduce a demonstration
retrieval algorithm and a text style transfer strategy to augment the navie
ICL. Specifically, we propose a novel practical attack framework named RAGAN to
generate high-quality fake user profiles, which can gain insights into the
robustness of RSs. The profiles are generated by a jailbreaker and
collaboratively optimized on an instructional agent and a guardian to improve
the attack transferability and imperceptibility. Comprehensive experiments on
various real-world datasets demonstrate that RAGAN achieves the
state-of-the-art poisoning attack performance.

TL;DR: IPIGuard是一种新的防御间接提示注入攻击的方法，通过将智能体任务执行建模为工具依赖图遍历，分离动作规划与外部数据交互，显著减少恶意工具调用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM智能体防御方法依赖模型自身安全性假设，缺乏对智能体行为的结构约束，仍然容易受到绕过安全防护的攻击。

Method: 提出IPIGuard防御框架，将智能体任务执行过程建模为工具依赖图(TDG)遍历，明确分离动作规划和外部数据交互。

Result: 在AgentDojo基准测试中，IPIGuard在有效性和鲁棒性之间取得了优越的平衡。

Conclusion: IPIGuard通过结构化约束显著增强了智能体系统在动态环境中的安全性，为开发更安全的智能体系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are widely deployed in real-world
applications, where they leverage tools to retrieve and manipulate external
data for complex tasks. However, when interacting with untrusted data sources
(e.g., fetching information from public websites), tool responses may contain
injected instructions that covertly influence agent behaviors and lead to
malicious outcomes, a threat referred to as Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI).
Existing defenses typically rely on advanced prompting strategies or auxiliary
detection models. While these methods have demonstrated some effectiveness,
they fundamentally rely on assumptions about the model's inherent security,
which lacks structural constraints on agent behaviors. As a result, agents
still retain unrestricted access to tool invocations, leaving them vulnerable
to stronger attack vectors that can bypass the security guardrails of the
model. To prevent malicious tool invocations at the source, we propose a novel
defensive task execution paradigm, called IPIGuard, which models the agents'
task execution process as a traversal over a planned Tool Dependency Graph
(TDG). By explicitly decoupling action planning from interaction with external
data, IPIGuard significantly reduces unintended tool invocations triggered by
injected instructions, thereby enhancing robustness against IPI attacks.
Experiments on the AgentDojo benchmark show that IPIGuard achieves a superior
balance between effectiveness and robustness, paving the way for the
development of safer agentic systems in dynamic environments.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: MCPTox是首个系统性评估LLM智能体对工具投毒攻击鲁棒性的基准测试，基于45个真实MCP服务器和353个工具构建了1312个恶意测试用例，发现主流LLM智能体普遍存在漏洞，攻击成功率高达72.8%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Model Context Protocol (MCP)为LLM智能体提供了标准化外部工具接口，但同时也引入了新的攻击面。现有研究主要关注通过工具输出注入攻击，而工具投毒攻击（在工具元数据中嵌入恶意指令）这一更基础的漏洞缺乏系统性评估。

Method: 构建MCPTox基准测试，基于45个真实MCP服务器和353个真实工具，设计了3种攻击模板，通过少样本学习生成1312个恶意测试用例，覆盖10个风险类别，并在20个主流LLM智能体上进行评估。

Result: 评估发现LLM智能体普遍易受工具投毒攻击，o1-mini的攻击成功率高达72.8%。能力更强的模型往往更容易受到攻击，因为它们具有更好的指令遵循能力。现有安全对齐机制对此类攻击无效，最高拒绝率不足3%。

Conclusion: 工具投毒攻击是一个广泛存在的威胁，现有安全措施无法有效防御。MCPTox为理解和缓解这一威胁提供了重要的实证基准，并公开发布以促进更安全的AI智能体开发。

Abstract: By providing a standardized interface for LLM agents to interact with
external tools, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) is quickly becoming a
cornerstone of the modern autonomous agent ecosystem. However, it creates novel
attack surfaces due to untrusted external tools. While prior work has focused
on attacks injected through external tool outputs, we investigate a more
fundamental vulnerability: Tool Poisoning, where malicious instructions are
embedded within a tool's metadata without execution. To date, this threat has
been primarily demonstrated through isolated cases, lacking a systematic,
large-scale evaluation.
  We introduce MCPTox, the first benchmark to systematically evaluate agent
robustness against Tool Poisoning in realistic MCP settings. MCPTox is
constructed upon 45 live, real-world MCP servers and 353 authentic tools. To
achieve this, we design three distinct attack templates to generate a
comprehensive suite of 1312 malicious test cases by few-shot learning, covering
10 categories of potential risks. Our evaluation on 20 prominent LLM agents
setting reveals a widespread vulnerability to Tool Poisoning, with o1-mini,
achieving an attack success rate of 72.8\%. We find that more capable models
are often more susceptible, as the attack exploits their superior
instruction-following abilities. Finally, the failure case analysis reveals
that agents rarely refuse these attacks, with the highest refused rate
(Claude-3.7-Sonnet) less than 3\%, demonstrating that existing safety alignment
is ineffective against malicious actions that use legitimate tools for
unauthorized operation. Our findings create a crucial empirical baseline for
understanding and mitigating this widespread threat, and we release MCPTox for
the development of verifiably safer AI agents. Our dataset is available at an
anonymized repository: \textit{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/AAAI26-7C02}.

Motivation: 分布偏移对深度学习异常检测系统构成关键挑战，现有系统难以适应这种变化。监督学习需要昂贵的人工标注，无监督学习需要干净的适应数据，这些要求在现实中都难以满足。

Method: NetSight采用新颖的伪标签技术消除人工干预，并使用基于知识蒸馏的适应策略来防止灾难性遗忘，实现在线持续检测和适应分布偏移。

Result: 在三个长期网络数据集上的评估显示，NetSight相比依赖人工标注的最先进方法表现出更优的适应性能，F1分数提升最高达11.72%。

Conclusion: NetSight证明了在经历分布偏移的动态网络中具有鲁棒性和有效性，能够持续适应变化而无需人工干预。

Abstract: Distribution shift, a change in the statistical properties of data over time,
poses a critical challenge for deep learning anomaly detection systems.
Existing anomaly detection systems often struggle to adapt to these shifts.
Specifically, systems based on supervised learning require costly manual
labeling, while those based on unsupervised learning rely on clean data, which
is difficult to obtain, for shift adaptation. Both of these requirements are
challenging to meet in practice. In this paper, we introduce NetSight, a
framework for supervised anomaly detection in network data that continually
detects and adapts to distribution shifts in an online manner. NetSight
eliminates manual intervention through a novel pseudo-labeling technique and
uses a knowledge distillation-based adaptation strategy to prevent catastrophic
forgetting. Evaluated on three long-term network datasets, NetSight
demonstrates superior adaptation performance compared to state-of-the-art
methods that rely on manual labeling, achieving F1-score improvements of up to
11.72%. This proves its robustness and effectiveness in dynamic networks that
experience distribution shifts over time.

Method: 提出BadFU攻击策略，恶意客户端在联邦训练过程中使用后门样本和伪装样本正常训练全局模型，当请求遗忘伪装样本时，全局模型会转变为后门状态。

Result: 在各种联邦学习框架和遗忘策略下的大量实验验证了BadFU的有效性，证明了当前联邦遗忘实践存在严重漏洞。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了联邦遗忘机制的关键安全漏洞，强调了开发更安全、更鲁棒的联邦遗忘机制的紧迫性。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has been widely adopted as a decentralized training
paradigm that enables multiple clients to collaboratively learn a shared model
without exposing their local data. As concerns over data privacy and regulatory
compliance grow, machine unlearning, which aims to remove the influence of
specific data from trained models, has become increasingly important in the
federated setting to meet legal, ethical, or user-driven demands. However,
integrating unlearning into FL introduces new challenges and raises largely
unexplored security risks. In particular, adversaries may exploit the
unlearning process to compromise the integrity of the global model. In this
paper, we present the first backdoor attack in the context of federated
unlearning, demonstrating that an adversary can inject backdoors into the
global model through seemingly legitimate unlearning requests. Specifically, we
propose BadFU, an attack strategy where a malicious client uses both backdoor
and camouflage samples to train the global model normally during the federated
training process. Once the client requests unlearning of the camouflage
samples, the global model transitions into a backdoored state. Extensive
experiments under various FL frameworks and unlearning strategies validate the
effectiveness of BadFU, revealing a critical vulnerability in current federated
unlearning practices and underscoring the urgent need for more secure and
robust federated unlearning mechanisms.

### [310] [Kernel-based Equalized Odds: A Quantification of Accuracy-Fairness Trade-off in Fair Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15084)
*Yijin Ni,Xiaoming Huo*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种核基于相等漏洞准则(EO)的新题形式EO_k，用于监督学习中的公平表征学习，能够统一分析不同公平性准则间的权衡关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决监督学习中的漏洞属性S导致的歧视问题，同时保持对目标变量Y的预测准确性。需要一种能够统一量化独立性、分离性和检验性等多种公平性目标的方法。

Method: 提出核基于相等漏洞准则的EO_k标准，定义了其经验对应统计量∫EO_k，该统计量可以在二次时间内计算，且有线性时间近似算法。涉及密度不等式的推导，为公平性符合性提供性能保障和错误界。

Result: 在无偏见(Y与S独立)和有偏见(Y依赖S)条件下，EO_k在前者中满足独立性和分离性，在后者中唯一保持预测准确性并下界独立性和检验性，从而提供了这些公平性准则间权衡关系的统一分析特征。

Conclusion: 该研究为原则性和可证明公平的算法设计奠定了重要的理论基础，虽然主要重点在理论发展，但成果将为未来的实证研究提供重要支撑。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel kernel-based formulation of the Equalized Odds
(EO) criterion, denoted as $EO_k$, for fair representation learning (FRL) in
supervised settings. The central goal of FRL is to mitigate discrimination
regarding a sensitive attribute $S$ while preserving prediction accuracy for
the target variable $Y$. Our proposed criterion enables a rigorous and
interpretable quantification of three core fairness objectives: independence
(prediction $\hat{Y}$ is independent of $S$), separation (also known as
equalized odds; prediction $\hat{Y}$ is independent with $S$ conditioned on
target attribute $Y$), and calibration ($Y$ is independent of $S$ conditioned
on the prediction $\hat{Y}$). Under both unbiased ($Y$ is independent of $S$)
and biased ($Y$ depends on $S$) conditions, we show that $EO_k$ satisfies both
independence and separation in the former, and uniquely preserves predictive
accuracy while lower bounding independence and calibration in the latter,
thereby offering a unified analytical characterization of the tradeoffs among
these fairness criteria. We further define the empirical counterpart,
$\hat{EO}_k$, a kernel-based statistic that can be computed in quadratic time,
with linear-time approximations also available. A concentration inequality for
$\hat{EO}_k$ is derived, providing performance guarantees and error bounds,
which serve as practical certificates of fairness compliance. While our focus
is on theoretical development, the results lay essential groundwork for
principled and provably fair algorithmic design in future empirical studies.

TL;DR: 提出了一种通用的系统辨识工具，首次为在线和离线贝叶斯推理与学习提供一致解决方案，能够融合显式和隐式先验系统知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在融合多样化先验知识（如部分已知系统方程和未知模型部分的平滑性假设）与数据信息方面存在挑战，特别是在具有潜在系统状态的输入-输出设置中。学习嵌套在已知系统方程内的函数是一个繁琐且容易出错的任务。

Method: 提出新颖接口将已知动力学函数与基于学习的未知系统部分近似相结合。基于提出的模型结构，推导出用于高效参数边缘化的闭式密度。无需用户定制的坐标变换或模型反演。

Result: 开发了一个通用框架，在三个不同的案例研究中展示了其广泛适用性，包括实验数据集。

Conclusion: 该框架为系统辨识提供了一个通用的解决方案，能够有效融合先验知识和数据信息，适用于在线和离线场景，具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Accuracy and generalization capabilities are key objectives when learning
dynamical system models. To obtain such models from limited data, current works
exploit prior knowledge and assumptions about the system. However, the fusion
of diverse prior knowledge, e. g. partially known system equations and
smoothness assumptions about unknown model parts, with information contained in
the data remains a challenging problem, especially in input-output settings
with latent system state. In particular, learning functions that are nested
inside known system equations can be a laborious and error-prone expert task.
This paper considers inference of latent states and learning of unknown model
parts for fusion of data information with different sources of prior knowledge.
The main contribution is a general-purpose system identification tool that, for
the first time, provides a consistent solution for both, online and offline
Bayesian inference and learning while allowing to incorporate explicit and
implicit prior system knowledge. We propose a novel interface for combining
known dynamics functions with a learning-based approximation of unknown system
parts. Based on the proposed model structure, closed-form densities for
efficient parameter marginalization are derived. No user-tailored coordinate
transformations or model inversions are needed, making the presented framework
a general-purpose tool for inference and learning. The broad applicability of
the devised framework is illustrated in three distinct case studies, including
an experimental data set.

TL;DR: 本文首次给出了噪声高斯过程预期改进(GP-EI)算法的累积悔憾上界分析，证明了其在SE和Matérn核下的无悔憾性质，为实践中的竞争者选择提供理论指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预期改进(EI)是贝叶斯优化中广泛使用的获取函数，但其累积悔憾上界理论一直是个开放问题，需要理论分析来支持其实践效果。

Method: 分析了噪声高斯过程预期改进(GP-EI)算法，考虑了三种常用竞争者：最佳后验均值竞争者(BPMI)、最佳采样后验均值竞争者(BSPMI)和最佳观测竞争者(BOI)。使用理论分析方法推导累积悔憾上界。

Result: 首次提供了GP-EI在BPMI和BSPMI竞争者下的累积悔憾上界，证明在SE和Matérn核下都是无悔憾算法。GP-EI使用BOI竞争者时要么达到次线性累积悔憾上界，要么具有快速收敛的噪声简单悔憾上界。

Conclusion: 研究给出了GP-EI算法的理论保障，为实践者在噪声环境中应用GP-EI时选择合适的竞争者提供了理论指导，数值实验验证了理论结果。

Abstract: Expected improvement (EI) is one of the most widely used acquisition
functions in Bayesian optimization (BO). Despite its proven empirical success
in applications, the cumulative regret upper bound of EI remains an open
question. In this paper, we analyze the classic noisy Gaussian process expected
improvement (GP-EI) algorithm. We consider the Bayesian setting, where the
objective is a sample from a GP. Three commonly used incumbents, namely the
best posterior mean incumbent (BPMI), the best sampled posterior mean incumbent
(BSPMI), and the best observation incumbent (BOI) are considered as the choices
of the current best value in GP-EI. We present for the first time the
cumulative regret upper bounds of GP-EI with BPMI and BSPMI. Importantly, we
show that in both cases, GP-EI is a no-regret algorithm for both squared
exponential (SE) and Mat\'ern kernels. Further, we present for the first time
that GP-EI with BOI either achieves a sublinear cumulative regret upper bound
or has a fast converging noisy simple regret bound for SE and Mat\'ern kernels.
Our results provide theoretical guidance to the choice of incumbent when
practitioners apply GP-EI in the noisy setting. Numerical experiments are
conducted to validate our findings.

Motivation: 表格数据中的特征交互建模是预测建模（如保险定价）的关键挑战，现有方法在保持可解释性的同时实现高精度存在困难

Method: 设计树状成对交互网络(PIN)，通过共享前馈神经网络架构显式捕获成对特征交互，模仿决策树结构，支持高效的SHAP计算

Conclusion: PIN架构成功平衡了预测精度和可解释性，为表格数据建模提供了有效的解决方案，特别适用于需要透明度的保险定价等应用

Abstract: Modeling feature interactions in tabular data remains a key challenge in
predictive modeling, for example, as used for insurance pricing. This paper
proposes the Tree-like Pairwise Interaction Network (PIN), a novel neural
network architecture that explicitly captures pairwise feature interactions
through a shared feed-forward neural network architecture that mimics the
structure of decision trees. PIN enables intrinsic interpretability by design,
allowing for direct inspection of interaction effects. Moreover, it allows for
efficient SHapley's Additive exPlanation (SHAP) computations because it only
involves pairwise interactions. We highlight connections between PIN and
established models such as GA2Ms, gradient boosting machines, and graph neural
networks. Empirical results on the popular French motor insurance dataset show
that PIN outperforms both traditional and modern neural networks benchmarks in
predictive accuracy, while also providing insight into how features interact
with each another and how they contribute to the predictions.

Result: 在历史ERA5数据上验证了模型准确性，并在多种未来气候变化情景下展示了外推能力。仅使用单一升温情景的一次实现进行训练，就能准确预测不同情景下的极端事件统计。

Conclusion: GEN2框架能够高效准确地预测气候极端事件统计，成功实现了训练数据分布之外的外推，为气候风险评估提供了计算效率高的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurately quantifying the increased risks of climate extremes requires
generating large ensembles of climate realization across a wide range of
emissions scenarios, which is computationally challenging for conventional
Earth System Models. We propose GEN2, a generative prediction-correction
framework for an efficient and accurate forecast of the extreme event
statistics. The prediction step is constructed as a conditional Gaussian
emulator, followed by a non-Gaussian machine-learning (ML) correction step. The
ML model is trained on pairs of the reference data and the emulated fields
nudged towards the reference, to ensure the training is robust to chaos. We
first validate the accuracy of our model on historical ERA5 data and then
demonstrate the extrapolation capabilities on various future climate change
scenarios. When trained on a single realization of one warming scenario, our
model accurately predicts the statistics of extreme events in different
scenarios, successfully extrapolating beyond the distribution of training data.

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) has emerged as a transformative technology,
demonstrating remarkable capabilities across diverse application domains.
However, GenAI faces several major challenges in developing reliable and
efficient GenAI-empowered systems due to its unpredictability and inefficiency.
This paper advocates for a paradigm shift: future GenAI-native systems should
integrate GenAI's cognitive capabilities with traditional software engineering
principles to create robust, adaptive, and efficient systems.
  We introduce foundational GenAI-native design principles centered around five
key pillars -- reliability, excellence, evolvability, self-reliance, and
assurance -- and propose architectural patterns such as GenAI-native cells,
organic substrates, and programmable routers to guide the creation of resilient
and self-evolving systems. Additionally, we outline the key ingredients of a
GenAI-native software stack and discuss the impact of these systems from
technical, user adoption, economic, and legal perspectives, underscoring the
need for further validation and experimentation. Our work aims to inspire
future research and encourage relevant communities to implement and refine this

Motivation: 预训练语言模型在代码理解中计算密集且推理延迟高，知识蒸馏技术在其他领域表现优异但在代码理解领域研究不足。

Method: 研究两种知识蒸馏方法（基于logit和基于特征），在8个学生模型和2个教师模型上进行实验，涵盖3个下游任务。

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏是代码理解任务中有效的模型压缩技术，特征蒸馏方法最具潜力，为高效代码理解模型部署提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for code
understanding. However, deploying these PLMs in large-scale applications faces
practical challenges due to their computational intensity and inference
latency. Knowledge distillation (KD), a promising model compression and
acceleration technique, addresses these limitations by transferring knowledge
from large teacher models to compact student models, enabling efficient
inference while preserving most of the teacher models' capabilities. While this
technique has shown remarkable success in natural language processing and
computer vision domains, its potential for code understanding tasks remains
largely underexplored.
  In this paper, we systematically investigate the effectiveness and usage of
KD in code understanding tasks. Our study encompasses two popular types of KD
methods, i.e., logit-based and feature-based KD methods, experimenting across
eight student models and two teacher PLMs from different domains on three
downstream tasks. The experimental results indicate that KD consistently offers
notable performance boosts across student models with different sizes compared
with standard fine-tuning. Notably, code-specific PLM demonstrates better
effectiveness as the teacher model. Among all KD methods, the latest
feature-based KD methods exhibit superior performance, enabling student models
to retain up to 98% teacher performance with merely 5% parameters. Regarding
student architecture, our experiments reveal that similarity with teacher
architecture does not necessarily lead to better performance. We further
discuss the efficiency and behaviors in the KD process and inference, summarize
the implications of findings, and identify promising future directions.

Conclusion: 该框架在海底声学通信安全、水下航行器隐身和声学监视防护等方面具有潜在应用价值

Abstract: In an environment where acoustic privacy or deliberate signal obfuscation is
desired, it is necessary to mask the acoustic signature generated in essential
operations. We consider the problem of masking the effect of an acoustic source
in a target region where possible detection sensors are located. Masking is
achieved by placing interference signals near the acoustic source. We introduce
a theoretical and computational framework for designing such interference
signals with the goal of minimizing the residual amplitude in the target
region. For the three-dimensional (3D) forced wave equation with spherical
symmetry, we derive analytical quasi-steady periodic solutions for several
canonical cases. We examine the phenomenon of self-masking where an acoustic
source with certain spatial forcing profile masks itself from detection outside
its forcing footprint. We then use superposition of spherically symmetric
solutions to investigate masking in a given target region. We analyze and
optimize the performance of using one or two point-forces deployed near the
acoustic source for masking in the target region. For the general case where
the spatial forcing profile of the acoustic source lacks spherical symmetry, we
develop an efficient numerical method for solving the 3D wave equation.
Potential applications of this work include undersea acoustic communication
security, undersea vehicles stealth, and protection against acoustic
surveillance.

Abstract: Speech is a cost-effective and non-intrusive data source for identifying
acute and chronic heart failure (HF). However, there is a lack of research on
whether Chinese syllables contain HF-related information, as observed in other
well-studied languages. This study presents the first Chinese speech database
of HF patients, featuring paired recordings taken before and after
hospitalisation. The findings confirm the effectiveness of the Chinese language
in HF detection using both standard 'patient-wise' and personalised 'pair-wise'
classification approaches, with the latter serving as an ideal
speaker-decoupled baseline for future research. Statistical tests and
classification results highlight individual differences as key contributors to
inaccuracy. Additionally, an adaptive frequency filter (AFF) is proposed for
frequency importance analysis. The data and demonstrations are published at

Conclusion: GOAT框架在减少TTS幻觉方面表现出强大的泛化能力和有效性，为LM-based TTS系统提供了高效的解决方案

Abstract: Language Model (LM)-based Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems often generate
hallucinated speech that deviates from input text. Existing mitigation
strategies either demand excessive training resources or introduce significant
inference latency. In this paper, we propose GFlOwNet-guided distribution
AlignmenT (GOAT) for LM-based TTS, a post-training framework that mitigates
hallucinations without relying on massive resources or inference cost.
Specifically, we first conduct an uncertainty analysis, revealing a strong
positive correlation between hallucination and model uncertainty. Based on
this, we reformulate TTS generation as a trajectory flow optimization problem
and introduce an enhanced Subtrajectory Balance objective together with a
sharpened internal reward as target distribution. We further integrate reward
temperature decay and learning rate optimization for stability and performance
balance. Extensive experiments show that GOAT reduce over 50% character error
rates on challenging test cases and lowering uncertainty by up to 58%,
demonstrating its strong generalization ability and effectiveness.

Abstract: Sea ice is governed by highly complex, scale-invariant, and anisotropic
processes that are challenging to represent in Earth system models. While
advanced numerical models have improved our understanding of the sea-ice
dynamics, their computational costs often limit their application in ensemble
forecasting and climate simulations. Here, we introduce GenSIM, the first
generative AI-based pan-Arctic model that predicts the evolution of all
relevant key properties, including concentration, thickness, and drift, in a
12-hour window with improved accuracy over deterministic predictions and high
computational efficiency, while remaining physically consistent. Trained on a
long simulation from a state-of-the-art sea-ice--ocean system, GenSIM robustly
reproduces statistics as observed in numerical models and observations,
exhibiting brittle-like short-term dynamics while also depicting the long-term
sea-ice decline. Driven solely by atmospheric forcings, we attribute GenSIM's
emergent extrapolation capabilities to patterns that reflect the long-term
impact of the ocean: it seemingly has learned an internal ocean emulator. This
ability to infer slowly evolving climate-relevant dynamics from short-term
predictions underlines the large potential of generative models to generalise
for unseen climates and to encode hidden physics.

Motivation: 评估AI天气模型在预测前所未有极端天气事件时的外推能力和可靠性，特别是在气候变化背景下频繁出现的破纪录极端天气事件。

Method: 比较HRES数值模型与GraphCast、Pangu-Weather、Fuxi等先进AI模型在破纪录高温、低温和大风事件中的预测表现，分析预报误差和偏差模式。

Result: AI模型在所有预报时效内对破纪录极端事件的预报误差均大于HRES，倾向于低估破纪录事件的频率和强度，对高温记录预测不足而对低温记录预测过度。

Conclusion: 当前AI天气模型在外推训练域之外的极端事件预测方面存在局限性，需要进一步严格验证和模型开发才能在高风险应用中单独依赖这些模型。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI)-based models are revolutionizing weather
forecasting and have surpassed leading numerical weather prediction systems on
various benchmark tasks. However, their ability to extrapolate and reliably
forecast unprecedented extreme events remains unclear. Here, we show that for
record-breaking weather extremes, the numerical model High RESolution forecast
(HRES) from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts still
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art AI models GraphCast, GraphCast
operational, Pangu-Weather, Pangu-Weather operational, and Fuxi. We demonstrate
that forecast errors in AI models are consistently larger for record-breaking
heat, cold, and wind than in HRES across nearly all lead times. We further find
that the examined AI models tend to underestimate both the frequency and
intensity of record-breaking events, and they underpredict hot records and
overestimate cold records with growing errors for larger record exceedance. Our
findings underscore the current limitations of AI weather models in
extrapolating beyond their training domain and in forecasting the potentially
most impactful record-breaking weather events that are particularly frequent in
a rapidly warming climate. Further rigorous verification and model development
is needed before these models can be solely relied upon for high-stakes
applications such as early warning systems and disaster management.

### [323] [JEDI-linear: Fast and Efficient Graph Neural Networks for Jet Tagging on FPGAs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15468)
*Zhiqiang Que,Chang Sun,Sudarshan Paramesvaran,Emyr Clement,Katerina Karakoulaki,Christopher Brown,Lauri Laatu,Arianna Cox,Alexander Tapper,Wayne Luk,Maria Spiropulu*

Main category: hep-ex

TL;DR: JEDI-linear是一种新型图神经网络架构，通过线性计算复杂度和硬件优化技术，在FPGA上实现了超低延迟和高资源效率的喷注标记，满足HL-LHC触发系统的严格要求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GNN在FPGA部署时面临计算复杂度高和内存访问模式不规则的问题，无法满足硬件触发系统的严格延迟和资源约束要求。

Method: 提出JEDI-linear架构，采用共享变换和全局聚合消除显式成对交互；引入细粒度量化感知训练和逐参数位宽优化；使用分布式算术实现无乘法器的乘累加操作。

Result: FPGA实现相比现有设计：延迟降低3.7-11.5倍，启动间隔降低高达150倍，LUT使用降低高达6.2倍，精度更高，完全无需DSP块（而现有方案需要8700+个DSP），首次实现低于60ns延迟。

Conclusion: 该工作推动了下一代触发系统发展，实现了实时环境中准确、可扩展且资源高效的GNN推理，开源模板将支持科学应用的复现和广泛采用。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), particularly Interaction Networks (INs), have
shown exceptional performance for jet tagging at the CERN High-Luminosity Large
Hadron Collider (HL-LHC). However, their computational complexity and irregular
memory access patterns pose significant challenges for deployment on FPGAs in
hardware trigger systems, where strict latency and resource constraints apply.
In this work, we propose JEDI-linear, a novel GNN architecture with linear
computational complexity that eliminates explicit pairwise interactions by
leveraging shared transformations and global aggregation. To further enhance
hardware efficiency, we introduce fine-grained quantization-aware training with
per-parameter bitwidth optimization and employ multiplier-free
multiply-accumulate operations via distributed arithmetic. Evaluation results
show that our FPGA-based JEDI-linear achieves 3.7 to 11.5 times lower latency,
up to 150 times lower initiation interval, and up to 6.2 times lower LUT usage
compared to state-of-the-art designs while also delivering higher model
accuracy and eliminating the need for DSP blocks entirely. In contrast,
state-of-the-art solutions consume over 8,700 DSPs. This is the first
interaction-based GNN to achieve less than 60~ns latency and currently meets
the requirements for use in the HL-LHC CMS Level-1 trigger system. This work
advances the next-generation trigger systems by enabling accurate, scalable,
and resource-efficient GNN inference in real-time environments. Our
open-sourced templates will further support reproducibility and broader
adoption across scientific applications.

*Zhongjun Ding,Yin Lin,Tianjing Zeng*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: AmbiSQL是一个交互式文本到SQL系统，通过自动检测查询歧义并通过多选问题引导用户澄清意图，显著提升SQL生成准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在文本到SQL任务中容易出错，查询歧义是主要障碍，导致用户意图误解和SQL生成不准确

Method: 引入细粒度歧义分类法识别影响数据库元素映射和LLM推理的歧义，通过用户反馈重写模糊问题，集成多选交互机制

Result: 在歧义查询数据集上达到87.2%的歧义检测精度，集成文本到SQL系统后SQL精确匹配准确率提升50%

Conclusion: AmbiSQL通过交互式歧义消解显著提升文本到SQL系统性能，具有实际应用价值

Abstract: Text-to-SQL systems translate natural language questions into SQL queries,
providing substantial value for non-expert users. While large language models
(LLMs) show promising results for this task, they remain error-prone. Query
ambiguity has been recognized as a major obstacle for LLM-based Text-to-SQL
systems, leading to misinterpretation of user intent and inaccurate SQL
generation. We demonstrate AmbiSQL, an interactive system that automatically
detects query ambiguities and guides users through intuitive multiple-choice
questions to clarify their intent. Our approach introduces a fine-grained
ambiguity taxonomy for identifying ambiguities that affect database element
mapping and LLM reasoning, then incorporates user feedback to rewrite ambiguous
questions. Evaluation on an ambiguous query dataset shows that AmbiSQL achieves
87.2% precision in ambiguity detection and improves SQL exact match accuracy by
50% when integrated with Text-to-SQL systems. Our demonstration showcases the
significant performance gains and highlights the system's practical usability.

*Ethan Lake,Ehsan Pajouheshgar*

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: 本文发现二维多体记忆系统的景观比之前认为的要丰富得多，存在多种不同于Toom规则的记忆机制，包括由涨落稳定的有序相和仅在噪声存在时保存信息的记忆方式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多体记忆系统的多样性，探索除了已知的Toom规则之外，是否存在其他能够在非平衡动力学中长期保持初始条件信息的局部动力学机制。

Method: 结合严格数学证明和机器学习方法，系统性地探索二维多体记忆系统的动力学行为，并通过交互式可视化展示研究结果。

Result: 发现了多种新型记忆机制：具有与Toom规则不同的纠错方式、由涨落稳定的有序相、以及仅在噪声环境下才能保存信息的记忆系统。

Conclusion: 物理系统可以通过多种不同方式实现鲁棒的信息存储，多体记忆物理学的丰富性远超之前的认识，为信息存储和容错计算提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: We investigate the landscape of many-body memories: families of local
non-equilibrium dynamics that retain information about their initial conditions
for thermodynamically long time scales, even in the presence of arbitrary
perturbations. In two dimensions, the only well-studied memory is Toom's rule.
Using a combination of rigorous proofs and machine learning methods, we show
that the landscape of 2D memories is in fact quite vast. We discover memories
that correct errors in ways qualitatively distinct from Toom's rule, have
ordered phases stabilized by fluctuations, and preserve information only in the
presence of noise. Taken together, our results show that physical systems can
perform robust information storage in many distinct ways, and demonstrate that
the physics of many-body memories is richer than previously realized.

*Qian-Rui Lee,Daw-Wei Wang*

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: 基于Flow Matching的机器学习框架，通过在小型晶格上训练，能够生成大型系统的可靠样本，实现温度连续范围的双重泛化能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 克服MCMC方法的扩展限制，为研究临界现象提供新的高效范式

Method: 使用Flow Matching框架学习温度条件映射，利用CNN架构的归纳偏置确保学习到的局部物理规则具有尺度不变性

Result: 在2D XY模型中，仅用32×32晶格训练的网络能够生成128×128系统的可靠样本，正确捕捉BKT转变特征，与热力学可观测量高度一致

Conclusion: 该方法建立了"训练小、生成大"的新范式，为探索热力学极限提供了显著计算优势，可直接应用于其他经典或量子多体系统

Abstract: We propose a machine learning framework based on Flow Matching to overcome
the scaling limitations of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. We
demonstrate its capability in the 2D XY model, where a single network, trained
only on configurations from a small ($32\times 32$) lattice at sparse
temperature points, generates reliable samples for a significantly larger
system ($128\times 128$) across a continuous temperature range without
retraining. The generated configurations show strong agreement with key
thermodynamic observables and correctly capture the signatures of the
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition. This dual generalization is
enabled by the Flow Matching framework, which allows us to learn a continuous,
temperature-conditioned mapping. At the same time, the inductive biases of the
underlying CNN architecture ensure that the learned local physical rules are
scale-invariant. This "train-small, generate-large" capability establishes a
new paradigm for efficiently studying critical phenomena, offering a
significant computational advantage for exploring the thermodynamic limit. The
method can be directly applied to other classical or quantum many-body systems
described by continuous fields on a lattice.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: GenTune是一个帮助设计师理解AI生成提示与图像内容映射关系的系统，通过可视化选择图像元素并追踪到对应提示标签，实现精确且全局一致的图像编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计师在使用生成式AI时面临两个主要挑战：难以理解冗长LLM生成提示中的关键词对应关系，以及局部编辑时难以保持全局一致性。

Method: 开发GenTune系统，允许设计师选择生成图像中的任何元素，追踪到对应的提示标签，并通过修改这些标签来指导精确且全局一致的图像优化。

Result: 在20名设计师的总结性研究中，GenTune显著提高了提示-图像理解、优化质量和效率，以及整体满意度（所有p<0.01）。实地研究进一步证明了其在真实环境中的有效性。

Conclusion: GenTune通过澄清AI生成提示与图像内容的映射关系，有效增强了人机协作，解决了设计师在使用生成式AI时遇到的关键挑战。

Abstract: Environment designers in the entertainment industry create imaginative 2D and
3D scenes for games, films, and television, requiring both fine-grained control
of specific details and consistent global coherence. Designers have
increasingly integrated generative AI into their workflows, often relying on
large language models (LLMs) to expand user prompts for text-to-image
generation, then iteratively refining those prompts and applying inpainting.
However, our formative study with 10 designers surfaced two key challenges: (1)
the lengthy LLM-generated prompts make it difficult to understand and isolate
the keywords that must be revised for specific visual elements; and (2) while
inpainting supports localized edits, it can struggle with global consistency
and correctness. Based on these insights, we present GenTune, an approach that
enhances human--AI collaboration by clarifying how AI-generated prompts map to
image content. Our GenTune system lets designers select any element in a
generated image, trace it back to the corresponding prompt labels, and revise
those labels to guide precise yet globally consistent image refinement. In a
summative study with 20 designers, GenTune significantly improved prompt--image
comprehension, refinement quality, and efficiency, and overall satisfaction
(all $p < .01$) compared to current practice. A follow-up field study with two
studios further demonstrated its effectiveness in real-world settings.

Abstract: Interactive digital maps have revolutionized how people travel and learn
about the world; however, they rely on pre-existing structured data in GIS
databases (e.g., road networks, POI indices), limiting their ability to address
geo-visual questions related to what the world looks like. We introduce our
vision for Geo-Visual Agents--multimodal AI agents capable of understanding and
responding to nuanced visual-spatial inquiries about the world by analyzing
large-scale repositories of geospatial images, including streetscapes (e.g.,
Google Street View), place-based photos (e.g., TripAdvisor, Yelp), and aerial
imagery (e.g., satellite photos) combined with traditional GIS data sources. We
define our vision, describe sensing and interaction approaches, provide three
exemplars, and enumerate key challenges and opportunities for future work.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) analysis stands at the forefront of neuroscience
and artificial intelligence research, where foundation models are reshaping the
traditional EEG analysis paradigm by leveraging their powerful representational
capacity and cross-modal generalization. However, the rapid proliferation of
these techniques has led to a fragmented research landscape, characterized by
diverse model roles, inconsistent architectures, and a lack of systematic
categorization. To bridge this gap, this study presents the first comprehensive
modality-oriented taxonomy for foundation models in EEG analysis,
systematically organizing research advances based on output modalities of the
native EEG decoding, EEG-text, EEG-vision, EEG-audio, and broader multimodal
frameworks. We rigorously analyze each category's research ideas, theoretical
foundations, and architectural innovations, while highlighting open challenges
such as model interpretability, cross-domain generalization, and real-world
applicability in EEG-based systems. By unifying this dispersed field, our work
not only provides a reference framework for future methodology development but
accelerates the translation of EEG foundation models into scalable,
interpretable, and online actionable solutions.

Method: 1）提出新的多比特权重表示技术-行列混合分组，通过在行和列上引入冗余来提高故障容锐性；2）设计了一个将故障意识权重分解问题重构为整数线性规划任务的编译器流程，利用现成求解器实现快速编译。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了模拟内存计算系统的可扩展性和部署性问题，为实际应用提供了高效的故障容锐解决方案。

Abstract: This paper addresses two critical challenges in analog In-Memory Computing
(IMC) systems that limit their scalability and deployability: the computational
unreliability caused by stuck-at faults (SAFs) and the high compilation
overhead of existing fault-mitigation algorithms, namely Fault-Free (FF). To
overcome these limitations, we first propose a novel multi-bit weight
representation technique, termed row-column hybrid grouping, which generalizes
conventional column grouping by introducing redundancy across both rows and
columns. This structural redundancy enhances fault tolerance and can be
effectively combined with existing fault-mitigation solutions. Second, we
design a compiler pipeline that reformulates the fault-aware weight
decomposition problem as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) task, enabling
fast and scalable compilation through off-the-shelf solvers. Further
acceleration is achieved through theoretical insights that identify fault
patterns amenable to trivial solutions, significantly reducing computation.
Experimental results on convolutional networks and small language models
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving up to 8%p improvement
in accuracy, 150x faster compilation, and 2x energy efficiency gain compared to
existing baselines.

### [1] [Topos Theory for Generative AI and LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08293)
*Sridhar Mahadevan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于拓扑理论的新型生成AI架构（GAIAs），利用范畴论中的通用构造构建LLM的新组合结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM研究多关注线性架构或专家混合模型，缺乏理论支持的组合结构。本文旨在利用范畴论探索LLM的新架构。

Method: 利用范畴论中的通用构造（如拉回、推出、指数对象等）设计LLM的新组合结构，并验证其形成拓扑。

Result: 证明了LLM范畴的完备性，并构建了拓扑结构，为LLM架构提供了理论支持。

Conclusion: 通过范畴论构建的新型LLM架构具有理论完备性，为生成AI设计提供了新方向。

Abstract: We propose the design of novel categorical generative AI architectures
(GAIAs) using topos theory, a type of category that is ``set-like": a topos has
all (co)limits, is Cartesian closed, and has a subobject classifier. Previous
theoretical results on the Transformer model have shown that it is a universal
sequence-to-sequence function approximator, and dense in the space of all
continuous functions with compact support on the Euclidean space of embeddings
of tokens. Building on this theoretical result, we explore novel architectures
for LLMs that exploit the property that the category of LLMs, viewed as
functions, forms a topos. Previous studies of large language models (LLMs) have
focused on daisy-chained linear architectures or mixture-of-experts. In this
paper, we use universal constructions in category theory to construct novel LLM
architectures based on new types of compositional structures. In particular,
these new compositional structures are derived from universal properties of LLM
categories, and include pullback, pushout, (co) equalizers, exponential
objects, and subobject classifiers. We theoretically validate these new
compositional structures by showing that the category of LLMs is (co)complete,
meaning that all diagrams have solutions in the form of (co)limits. Building on
this completeness result, we then show that the category of LLMs forms a topos,
a ``set-like" category, which requires showing the existence of exponential
objects as well as subobject classifiers. We use a functorial characterization
of backpropagation to define a potential implementation of an LLM topos
architecture.

### [2] [Topos Causal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08295)
*Sridhar Mahadevan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的因果模型类别——拓扑因果模型（TCMs），利用拓扑范畴的关键性质（如完备性、子对象分类器和指数对象）来解决因果推断中的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在展示拓扑范畴的性质（如完备性和子对象分类器）在因果推断中的核心作用，例如通过子对象分类器实现因果干预的范畴化表达。

Method: 通过定义局部自主因果机制的集合，构建全局函数，并证明TCMs范畴的完备性，使得任意因果图可以通过极限或余极限“求解”。

Result: 证明了TCMs的完备性，展示了如何通过子对象分类器建模因果干预，以及如何利用指数对象推理因果等价类。

Conclusion: TCMs为因果推断提供了一种强大的范畴化框架，支持内部逻辑和语义推理，扩展了因果模型的应用范围。

Abstract: We propose topos causal models (TCMs), a novel class of causal models that
exploit the key properties of a topos category: they are (co)complete, meaning
all (co)limits exist, they admit a subobject classifier, and allow exponential
objects. The main goal of this paper is to show that these properties are
central to many applications in causal inference. For example, subobject
classifiers allow a categorical formulation of causal intervention, which
creates sub-models. Limits and colimits allow causal diagrams of arbitrary
complexity to be ``solved", using a novel interpretation of causal
approximation. Exponential objects enable reasoning about equivalence classes
of operations on causal models, such as covered edge reversal and causal
homotopy. Analogous to structural causal models (SCMs), TCMs are defined by a
collection of functions, each defining a ``local autonomous" causal mechanism
that assemble to induce a unique global function from exogenous to endogenous
variables. Since the category of TCMs is (co)complete, which we prove in this
paper, every causal diagram has a ``solution" in the form of a (co)limit: this
implies that any arbitrary causal model can be ``approximated" by some global
function with respect to the morphisms going into or out of the diagram.
Natural transformations are crucial in measuring the quality of approximation.
In addition, we show that causal interventions are modeled by subobject
classifiers: any sub-model is defined by a monic arrow into its parent model.
Exponential objects permit reasoning about entire classes of causal
equivalences and interventions. Finally, as TCMs form a topos, they admit an
internal logic defined as a Mitchell-Benabou language with an associated
Kripke-Joyal semantics. We show how to reason about causal models in TCMs using
this internal logic.

### [3] [An Efficient Application of Goal Programming to Tackle Multiobjective Problems with Recurring Fitness Landscapes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08297)
*Rodrigo Lankaites Pinheiro,Dario Landa-Silva,Wasakorn Laesanklang,Ademir Aparecido Constantino*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种方法，利用多目标算法解决一个问题实例，再通过目标规划和高效单目标算法解决相似问题实例，以快速获得高质量解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高度约束多目标问题中获取高质量近似解的困难，利用问题实例间适应度景观的相似性。

Method: 先使用计算密集型多目标算法解决一个问题实例，再用目标规划和单目标算法解决其他相似实例。

Result: 在多目标车辆路径问题基准实例上，该方法在短计算时间内获得了良好结果。

Conclusion: 结合多目标算法的有效性和目标规划的高效性，适用于适应度景观相似的问题场景。

Abstract: Many real-world applications require decision-makers to assess the quality of
solutions while considering multiple conflicting objectives. Obtaining good
approximation sets for highly constrained many-objective problems is often a
difficult task even for modern multiobjective algorithms. In some cases,
multiple instances of the problem scenario present similarities in their
fitness landscapes. That is, there are recurring features in the fitness
landscapes when searching for solutions to different problem instances. We
propose a methodology to exploit this characteristic by solving one instance of
a given problem scenario using computationally expensive multiobjective
algorithms to obtain a good approximation set and then using Goal Programming
with efficient single-objective algorithms to solve other instances of the same
problem scenario. We use three goal-based objective functions and show that on
benchmark instances of the multiobjective vehicle routing problem with time
windows, the methodology is able to produce good results in short computation
time. The methodology allows to combine the effectiveness of state-of-the-art
multiobjective algorithms with the efficiency of goal programming to find good
compromise solutions in problem scenarios where instances have similar fitness
landscapes.

### [4] [LLM-BI: Towards Fully Automated Bayesian Inference with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08300)
*Yongchao Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了利用大型语言模型（LLM）自动化贝叶斯推断流程的可行性，提出了LLM-BI概念，并通过实验验证了其潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 贝叶斯推断的广泛应用受到先验分布和似然函数设定复杂性的限制，需要专业统计知识。本文旨在探索LLM能否自动化这一过程。

Method: 提出LLM-BI概念，通过两个实验验证：实验I展示LLM能从自然语言中提取先验分布；实验II展示LLM能从高层问题描述中指定完整模型结构。

Result: 实验结果表明，LLM能够自动化贝叶斯建模的关键步骤，为概率编程的自动化推断流程提供了可能性。

Conclusion: LLM在自动化贝叶斯推断中具有潜力，未来可能实现完整的自动化流程。

Abstract: A significant barrier to the widespread adoption of Bayesian inference is the
specification of prior distributions and likelihoods, which often requires
specialized statistical expertise. This paper investigates the feasibility of
using a Large Language Model (LLM) to automate this process. We introduce
LLM-BI (Large Language Model-driven Bayesian Inference), a conceptual pipeline
for automating Bayesian workflows. As a proof-of-concept, we present two
experiments focused on Bayesian linear regression. In Experiment I, we
demonstrate that an LLM can successfully elicit prior distributions from
natural language. In Experiment II, we show that an LLM can specify the entire
model structure, including both priors and the likelihood, from a single
high-level problem description. Our results validate the potential of LLMs to
automate key steps in Bayesian modeling, enabling the possibility of an
automated inference pipeline for probabilistic programming.

### [5] [First Ask Then Answer: A Framework Design for AI Dialogue Based on Supplementary Questioning with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08308)
*Chuanruo Fu,Yuncheng Du*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为FATA的新交互范式，通过引导LLMs主动生成多维补充问题，结合用户提供的补充信息，显著提升回答质量和相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在用户信息不完整或模糊时回答不准确的问题。

Method: 采用FATA范式，通过提示词引导LLMs生成补充问题，结合用户反馈优化回答。

Result: FATA在综合指标上优于基线提示40%，且稳定性更高。

Conclusion: FATA通过增强用户参与和问题完整性，显著提升了LLMs的交互效果。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to deliver accurate and
actionable answers when user-provided information is incomplete or
ill-specified. We propose a new interaction paradigm, First Ask Then Answer
(FATA), in which, through prompt words, LLMs are guided to proactively generate
multidimensional supplementary questions for users prior to response
generation. Subsequently, by integrating user-provided supplementary
information with the original query through sophisticated prompting techniques,
we achieve substantially improved response quality and relevance. In contrast
to existing clarification approaches -- such as the CLAM framework oriented to
ambiguity and the self-interrogation Self-Ask method -- FATA emphasizes
completeness (beyond mere disambiguation) and user participation (inviting
human input instead of relying solely on model-internal reasoning). It also
adopts a single-turn strategy: all clarifying questions are produced at once,
thereby reducing dialogue length and improving efficiency. Conceptually, FATA
uses the reasoning power of LLMs to scaffold user expression, enabling
non-expert users to formulate more comprehensive and contextually relevant
queries. To evaluate FATA, we constructed a multi-domain benchmark and compared
it with two controls: a baseline prompt (B-Prompt) and a context-enhanced
expert prompt (C-Prompt). Experimental results show that FATA outperforms
B-Prompt by approximately 40% in aggregate metrics and exhibits a coefficient
of variation 8% lower than C-Prompt, indicating superior stability.

### [6] [What Breaks Knowledge Graph based RAG? Empirical Insights into Reasoning under Incomplete Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08344)
*Dongzhuoran Zhou,Yuqicheng Zhu,Xiaxia Wang,Hongkuan Zhou,Yuan He,Jiaoyan Chen,Evgeny Kharlamov,Steffen Staab*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种评估知识图谱增强生成（KG-RAG）方法的新基准和协议，揭示了当前方法在知识缺失情况下的推理能力不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法无法区分模型是通过推理还是直接检索答案，且评估指标不一致，导致比较困难。

Method: 提出了一种构建基准和评估协议的通用方法，用于系统评估知识不完整情况下的KG-RAG方法。

Result: 实验表明，当前KG-RAG方法在知识缺失时推理能力有限，依赖内部记忆，且泛化能力因设计而异。

Conclusion: 需要改进KG-RAG方法以提升其在知识缺失情况下的推理能力，并采用更严格的评估标准。

Abstract: Knowledge Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-RAG) is an
increasingly explored approach for combining the reasoning capabilities of
large language models with the structured evidence of knowledge graphs.
However, current evaluation practices fall short: existing benchmarks often
include questions that can be directly answered using existing triples in KG,
making it unclear whether models perform reasoning or simply retrieve answers
directly. Moreover, inconsistent evaluation metrics and lenient answer matching
criteria further obscure meaningful comparisons. In this work, we introduce a
general method for constructing benchmarks, together with an evaluation
protocol, to systematically assess KG-RAG methods under knowledge
incompleteness. Our empirical results show that current KG-RAG methods have
limited reasoning ability under missing knowledge, often rely on internal
memorization, and exhibit varying degrees of generalization depending on their
design.

### [7] [UrzaGPT: LoRA-Tuned Large Language Models for Card Selection in Collectible Card Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08382)
*Timo Bertram*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: UrzaGPT是一个基于大型语言模型的AI，用于实时推荐《万智牌》中的选牌决策，通过微调小型模型实现了66.2%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于集换式卡牌游戏（CCG）的部分可观察性、长期决策和不断变化的卡牌库，现有AI在任务如组牌和游戏表现上远不如人类玩家。

Method: 使用低秩适应（LoRA）微调方法，在标注的选牌日志数据集上训练开源权重的大型语言模型（LLM）。

Result: 未经调优的小型LLM（如Llama-3-8B）完全无法选牌，而GPT-4o的零样本性能为43%。UrzaGPT微调后的小型模型达到66.2%的准确率。

Conclusion: 研究表明，仅使用LLM进行选牌是可行的，未来LLM可以支持高性能、通用且易于更新的选牌AI。

Abstract: Collectible card games (CCGs) are a difficult genre for AI due to their
partial observability, long-term decision-making, and evolving card sets. Due
to this, current AI models perform vastly worse than human players at CCG tasks
such as deckbuilding and gameplay. In this work, we introduce UrzaGPT, a
domain-adapted large language model that recommends real-time drafting
decisions in Magic: The Gathering. Starting from an open-weight LLM, we use
Low-Rank Adaptation fine-tuning on a dataset of annotated draft logs. With
this, we leverage the language modeling capabilities of LLM, and can quickly
adapt to different expansions of the game. We benchmark UrzaGPT in comparison
to zero-shot LLMs and the state-of-the-art domain-specific model. Untuned,
small LLMs like Llama-3-8B are completely unable to draft, but the larger
GPT-4o achieves a zero-shot performance of 43%. Using UrzaGPT to fine-tune
smaller models, we achieve an accuracy of 66.2% using only 10,000 steps.
Despite this not reaching the capability of domain-specific models, we show
that solely using LLMs to draft is possible and conclude that using LLMs can
enable performant, general, and update-friendly drafting AIs in the future.

### [8] [Bilevel MCTS for Amortized O(1) Node Selection in Classical Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08385)
*Masataro Asai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进MCTS的方法，通过双层修改和树折叠技术，解决了节点选择的时间复杂度问题，实现了与传统队列相当的O(1)时间复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MCTS在经典规划中节点选择的时间复杂度较高（O(log N)），而传统队列为O(1)。游戏树搜索中此成本可忽略，但在规划中因深度d较大而显著。

Method: 提出双层MCTS修改，从每个选中的叶节点运行最佳优先搜索，并引入树折叠技术以减少动作选择步骤。

Result: 实现了节点选择的O(1)时间复杂度，性能显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了MCTS在经典规划中的瓶颈问题，性能优于传统方法。

Abstract: We study an efficient implementation of Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB)-based
Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for classical planning. One weakness of MCTS is
that it spends a significant time deciding which node to expand next. While
selecting a node from an OPEN list with $N$ nodes has $O(1)$ runtime complexity
with traditional array-based priority-queues for dense integer keys, the
tree-based OPEN list used by MCTS requires $O(\log N)$, which roughly
corresponds to the search depth $d$. In classical planning, $d$ is arbitrarily
large (e.g., $2^k-1$ in $k$-disk Tower-of-Hanoi) and the runtime for node
selection is significant, unlike in game tree search, where the cost is
negligible compared to the node evaluation (rollouts) because $d$ is inherently
limited by the game (e.g., $d\leq 361$ in Go). To improve this bottleneck, we
propose a bilevel modification to MCTS that runs a best-first search from each
selected leaf node with an expansion budget proportional to $d$, which achieves
amortized $O(1)$ runtime for node selection, equivalent to the traditional
queue-based OPEN list. In addition, we introduce Tree Collapsing, an
enhancement that reduces action selection steps and further improves the
performance.

### [9] [Solver-Aided Expansion of Loops to Avoid Generate-and-Test](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08442)
*Niklas Dewally,Özgür Akgün*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种避免完全枚举的方法，通过求解器计算仅需的组合，显著提升编译效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在编译时需要完全枚举循环变量组合，效率低下，尤其在大范围变量和选择性条件下。

Method: 利用求解器仅计算生成最终约束所需的组合，避免完全枚举。

Result: 生成的模型与传统方法相同，但编译速度显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法提高了高级用户模型到求解器形式的翻译效率，特别适用于大范围变量和选择性条件的情况。

Abstract: Constraint modelling languages like MiniZinc and Essence rely on unrolling
loops (in the form of quantified expressions and comprehensions) during
compilation. Standard approaches generate all combinations of induction
variables and use partial evaluation to discard those that simplify to identity
elements of associative-commutative operators (e.g. true for conjunction, 0 for
summation). This can be inefficient for problems where most combinations are
ultimately irrelevant. We present a method that avoids full enumeration by
using a solver to compute only the combinations required to generate the final
set of constraints. The resulting model is identical to that produced by
conventional flattening, but compilation can be significantly faster. This
improves the efficiency of translating high-level user models into solver-ready
form, particularly when induction variables range over large domains with
selective preconditions.

### [10] [OverFill: Two-Stage Models for Efficient Language Model Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08446)
*Woojeong Kim,Junxiong Wang,Jing Nathan Yan,Mohamed Abdelfattah,Alexander M. Rush*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OverFill通过解耦预填充和解码阶段，优化LLM的推理效率，提升生成质量，同时减少训练数据需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）推理成本高，尤其是解码阶段延迟显著。现有模型对预填充和解码阶段处理方式单一，未能充分利用其不同的计算特性。

Method: 提出OverFill，将预填充和解码阶段解耦：预填充使用完整模型并行处理输入，解码阶段切换到密集剪枝模型顺序生成令牌。

Result: 3B到1B的OverFill配置比1B剪枝模型性能提升83.2%，8B到3B配置比3B剪枝模型提升79.2%，且性能与从头训练的相同规模模型相当。

Conclusion: OverFill在提升生成质量和效率的同时，显著减少训练数据需求，为LLM部署提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel across diverse tasks but face significant
deployment challenges due to high inference costs. LLM inference comprises
prefill (compute-bound) and decode (memory-bound) stages, with decode
dominating latency particularly for long sequences. Current decoder-only models
handle both stages uniformly, despite their distinct computational profiles. We
propose OverFill, which decouples these stages to optimize accuracy-efficiency
tradeoffs. OverFill begins with a full model for prefill, processing system and
user inputs in parallel. It then switches to a dense pruned model, while
generating tokens sequentially. Leveraging more compute during prefill,
OverFill improves generation quality with minimal latency overhead. Our
3B-to-1B OverFill configuration outperforms 1B pruned models by 83.2%, while
the 8B-to-3B configuration improves over 3B pruned models by 79.2% on average
across standard benchmarks. OverFill matches the performance of same-sized
models trained from scratch, while using significantly less training data. Our
code is available at https://github.com/friendshipkim/overfill.

### [11] [A Fast GRASP Metaheuristic for the Trigger Arc TSP with MIP-Based Construction and Multi-Neighborhood Local Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08477)
*Joan Salvà Soler,Grégoire de Lambertye*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于GRASP的元启发式算法，用于解决动态弧成本变化的触发弧旅行商问题（TA-TSP），在MESS 2024竞赛中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TA-TSP扩展了经典TSP，模拟了动态成本场景（如仓库操作），需要高效算法解决。

Method: 结合多种构造启发式和多邻域局部搜索，构造阶段使用MIP技术，改进阶段应用2-Opt、Swap和Relocate操作。

Result: 在60秒内平均最优性差距为0.77%和0.40%，在合成数据集上比Gurobi求解器优11.3%。

Conclusion: 算法在MESS 2024中表现优异，适用于实时路由应用。

Abstract: The Trigger Arc Traveling Salesman Problem (TA-TSP) extends the classical TSP
by introducing dynamic arc costs that change when specific \textit{trigger}
arcs are traversed, modeling scenarios such as warehouse operations with
compactable storage systems. This paper introduces a GRASP-based metaheuristic
that combines multiple construction heuristics with a multi-neighborhood local
search. The construction phase uses mixed-integer programming (MIP) techniques
to transform the TA-TSP into a sequence of tailored TSP instances, while the
improvement phase applies 2-Opt, Swap, and Relocate operators. Computational
experiments on MESS 2024 competition instances achieved average optimality gaps
of 0.77\% and 0.40\% relative to the best-known solutions within a 60-second
limit. On smaller, synthetically generated datasets, the method produced
solutions 11.3\% better than the Gurobi solver under the same time constraints.
The algorithm finished in the top three at MESS 2024, demonstrating its
suitability for real-time routing applications with state-dependent travel
costs.

### [12] [Beyond Ordinal Preferences: Why Alignment Needs Cardinal Human Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08486)
*Parker Whitfill,Stewy Slocum*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文指出，基于序数比较的LLM对齐方法存在根本性限制，无法系统性地恢复最优模型。通过引入基数反馈（如支付意愿）改进偏好微调，模型能更好地权衡改进，并在下游任务中表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM对齐方法依赖序数偏好数据，无法解决模型间的权衡问题，导致无法系统性恢复最优模型。

Method: 提出使用基数反馈（支付意愿）替代序数比较，收集25,000条基数判断数据，改进偏好微调方法。

Result: 实验表明，基数反馈方法能优先处理高影响力改进，并在Arena-Hard等基准测试中优于序数方法。

Conclusion: 基数反馈是解决LLM对齐中权衡问题的关键，优于传统序数方法。

Abstract: Alignment techniques for LLMs rely on optimizing preference-based objectives
-- where these preferences are typically elicited as ordinal, binary choices
between responses. Recent work has focused on improving label quality or
mitigating particular biases, but we identify a more fundamental limitation:
these methods collect the wrong kind of data. We prove an impossibility result:
no algorithm relying solely on ordinal comparisons can systematically recover
the most preferred model. Intuitively, ordinal data lacks the information
needed to resolve tradeoffs -- e.g., fixing a factual error on one prompt
versus improving style on another. We show that selecting the optimal model
requires recovering preferences over \emph{models} (rather than just
responses), which can only be identified given cardinal feedback about response
quality. To address this, we collect and publicly release a dataset of 25,000
cardinal judgments using willingness-to-pay elicitations, a well-established
tool from experimental economics. Empirically, we find that incorporating
cardinal feedback into preference fine-tuning allows models to prioritize
high-impact improvements and outperform ordinal-only methods on downstream
benchmarks, such as Arena-Hard.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: POMO+是POMO的改进版本，通过更智能地利用初始节点来提升组合问题的求解效果，实验表明其在CVRPLIB数据集上表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管POMO在组合问题中表现良好，但仍有改进空间，尤其是在车辆路径问题（VRP）中。

Method: 提出POMO+，通过更智能地利用初始节点来优化求解过程。

Result: 在CVRPLIB数据集上，POMO+收敛更快且结果更优，适用于最多100个客户的问题实例。

Conclusion: POMO+为组合问题的求解提供了进一步改进的方向。

Abstract: In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) methods have emerged as a
promising approach for solving combinatorial problems. Among RL-based models,
POMO has demonstrated strong performance on a variety of tasks, including
variants of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP). However, there is room for
improvement for these tasks. In this work, we improved POMO, creating a method
(\textbf{POMO+}) that leverages the initial nodes to find a solution in a more
informed way. We ran experiments on our new model and observed that our
solution converges faster and achieves better results. We validated our models
on the CVRPLIB dataset and noticed improvements in problem instances with up to
100 customers. We hope that our research in this project can lead to further
advancements in the field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本体对齐在跨领域数据集成中至关重要，但高质量对应关系生成仍具挑战性。人工参与成本高，尤其在大型本体中。

Method: 利用LLM验证本体对齐系统中不确定性高的对应关系，基于OAEI任务进行广泛评估，比较不同LLM和提示模板的性能。

Result: LLM在验证不确定性高的对应关系时表现良好，并与模拟Oracle的误差率进行了对比。

Conclusion: LLM可作为领域专家的替代方案，验证不确定性高的本体对齐对应关系，具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Ontology alignment plays a crucial role in integrating diverse data sources
across domains. There is a large plethora of systems that tackle the ontology
alignment problem, yet challenges persist in producing highly quality
correspondences among a set of input ontologies. Human-in-the-loop during the
alignment process is essential in applications requiring very accurate
mappings. User involvement is, however, expensive when dealing with large
ontologies. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of using Large Language
Models (LLM) as an alternative to the domain expert. The use of the LLM focuses
only on the validation of the subset of correspondences where an ontology
alignment system is very uncertain. We have conducted an extensive evaluation

*Yuchen Li,Cong Lin,Muhammad Umair Nasir,Philip Bontrager,Jialin Liu,Julian Togelius*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GVGAI-LLM是一个基于视频游戏的基准测试，用于评估大型语言模型（LLMs）的推理和问题解决能力，揭示了其在空间推理和基础规划方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM基准测试大多缺乏对空间推理和复杂任务处理能力的评估，GVGAI-LLM旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 利用通用视频游戏AI框架，通过ASCII字符表示游戏场景，并设计可解释的指标（如有效步骤比率、步骤效率等）进行评估。

Result: 零样本评估显示LLMs在空间推理和基础规划方面存在明显不足，结构化提示和空间接地技术仅带来部分改进。

Conclusion: GVGAI-LLM为语言模型能力研究提供了可复现的测试平台，尤其在代理行为和上下文推理方面具有潜力。

Abstract: We introduce GVGAI-LLM, a video game benchmark for evaluating the reasoning
and problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Built on the
General Video Game AI framework, it features a diverse collection of
arcade-style games designed to test a model's ability to handle tasks that
differ from most existing LLM benchmarks. The benchmark leverages a game
description language that enables rapid creation of new games and levels,
helping to prevent overfitting over time. Each game scene is represented by a
compact set of ASCII characters, allowing for efficient processing by language
models. GVGAI-LLM defines interpretable metrics, including the meaningful step
ratio, step efficiency, and overall score, to assess model behavior. Through
zero-shot evaluations across a broad set of games and levels with diverse
challenges and skill depth, we reveal persistent limitations of LLMs in spatial
reasoning and basic planning. Current models consistently exhibit spatial and
logical errors, motivating structured prompting and spatial grounding
techniques. While these interventions lead to partial improvements, the
benchmark remains very far from solved. GVGAI-LLM provides a reproducible
testbed for advancing research on language model capabilities, with a
particular emphasis on agentic behavior and contextual reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SynLLM是一个模块化框架，利用20种开源LLM生成高质量合成医疗数据，通过结构化提示和全面评估确保数据质量与隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 真实医疗数据因隐私法规受限，合成数据成为替代方案，但现有方法缺乏系统提示策略和全面评估框架。

Method: SynLLM采用四种提示类型（如示例驱动和规则约束），结合20种LLM生成数据，并通过多维度评估（统计保真度、临床一致性和隐私保护）验证。

Result: 在三个医疗数据集上测试显示，规则提示在隐私与质量间取得最佳平衡，LLM能生成临床合理且隐私安全的合成数据。

Conclusion: SynLLM证明，通过精心设计的提示和全面评估，LLM可生成高质量合成医疗数据，推动医疗研究数据共享。

Abstract: Access to real-world medical data is often restricted due to privacy
regulations, posing a significant barrier to the advancement of healthcare
research. Synthetic data offers a promising alternative; however, generating
realistic, clinically valid, and privacy-conscious records remains a major
challenge. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new
opportunities for structured data generation; however, existing approaches
frequently lack systematic prompting strategies and comprehensive,
multi-dimensional evaluation frameworks.
  In this paper, we present SynLLM, a modular framework for generating
high-quality synthetic medical tabular data using 20 state-of-the-art
open-source LLMs, including LLaMA, Mistral, and GPT variants, guided by
structured prompts. We propose four distinct prompt types, ranging from
example-driven to rule-based constraints, that encode schema, metadata, and
domain knowledge to control generation without model fine-tuning. Our framework
features a comprehensive evaluation pipeline that rigorously assesses generated
data across statistical fidelity, clinical consistency, and privacy
preservation.
  We evaluate SynLLM across three public medical datasets, including Diabetes,
Cirrhosis, and Stroke, using 20 open-source LLMs. Our results show that prompt
engineering significantly impacts data quality and privacy risk, with
rule-based prompts achieving the best privacy-quality balance. SynLLM
establishes that, when guided by well-designed prompts and evaluated with
robust, multi-metric criteria, LLMs can generate synthetic medical data that is
both clinically plausible and privacy-aware, paving the way for safer and more
effective data sharing in healthcare research.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无监督且通用的网格移动网络（UGM2N），通过局部几何特征学习和物理约束损失函数，实现了高效、通用的网格自适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统网格移动方法计算复杂度高且几何灵活性不足，现有监督学习方法难以实现零样本泛化。

Method: 采用无监督局部几何特征学习和M-Uniform损失函数，实现网格节点的动态调整。

Result: UGM2N在多种PDE和网格几何中表现优异，具有可扩展性和无网格纠缠的误差减少。

Conclusion: UGM2N是一种高效、通用的网格自适应方法，优于现有技术。

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) form the mathematical foundation for
modeling physical systems in science and engineering, where numerical solutions
demand rigorous accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs. Mesh movement techniques address
this challenge by dynamically relocating mesh nodes to rapidly-varying regions,
enhancing both simulation accuracy and computational efficiency. However,
traditional approaches suffer from high computational complexity and geometric
inflexibility, limiting their applicability, and existing supervised
learning-based approaches face challenges in zero-shot generalization across
diverse PDEs and mesh topologies.In this paper, we present an Unsupervised and
Generalizable Mesh Movement Network (UGM2N). We first introduce unsupervised
mesh adaptation through localized geometric feature learning, eliminating the
dependency on pre-adapted meshes. We then develop a physics-constrained loss
function, M-Uniform loss, that enforces mesh equidistribution at the nodal
level.Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed network exhibits
equation-agnostic generalization and geometric independence in efficient mesh
adaptation. It demonstrates consistent superiority over existing methods,
including robust performance across diverse PDEs and mesh geometries,
scalability to multi-scale resolutions and guaranteed error reduction without
mesh tangling.

Result: AgriGPT在领域适应和推理能力上显著优于通用LLM。

Conclusion: AgriGPT为农业提供了一个模块化、可扩展的LLM生态系统，并为其他领域专用LLM开发提供了通用框架。

Abstract: Despite the rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs), their application
in agriculture remains limited due to the lack of domain-specific models,
curated datasets, and robust evaluation frameworks. To address these
challenges, we propose AgriGPT, a domain-specialized LLM ecosystem for
agricultural usage. At its core, we design a multi-agent scalable data engine
that systematically compiles credible data sources into Agri-342K, a
high-quality, standardized question-answer (QA) dataset. Trained on this
dataset, AgriGPT supports a broad range of agricultural stakeholders, from
practitioners to policy-makers. To enhance factual grounding, we employ
Tri-RAG, a three-channel Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework combining
dense retrieval, sparse retrieval, and multi-hop knowledge graph reasoning,
thereby improving the LLM's reasoning reliability. For comprehensive
evaluation, we introduce AgriBench-13K, a benchmark suite comprising 13 tasks
with varying types and complexities. Experiments demonstrate that AgriGPT
significantly outperforms general-purpose LLMs on both domain adaptation and
reasoning. Beyond the model itself, AgriGPT represents a modular and extensible
LLM ecosystem for agriculture, comprising structured data construction,
retrieval-enhanced generation, and domain-specific evaluation. This work
provides a generalizable framework for developing scientific and
industry-specialized LLMs. All models, datasets, and code will be released to
empower agricultural communities, especially in underserved regions, and to
promote open, impactful research.

*HuanYu Yang,Fengming Zhu,YangFan Wu,Jianmin Ji*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种称为“diminution”的方法，通过选择Herbrand宇宙的子集来减少ASP中的基础程序规模，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASP常因基础程序规模过大而效率低下，现有方法多依赖临时启发式，缺乏通用策略。

Method: 定义并形式化“diminution”概念，分析其性质与识别复杂度，利用特定编码让ASP求解器评估候选子集。

Result: 在五个基准测试中，基础时间平均减少70%，基础文件大小减少85%。

Conclusion: diminution是一种通用且有效的方法，可显著缓解ASP中的基础瓶颈。

Abstract: Answer Set Programming (ASP) is often hindered by the grounding bottleneck:
large Herbrand universes generate ground programs so large that solving becomes
difficult. Many methods employ ad-hoc heuristics to improve grounding
performance, motivating the need for a more formal and generalizable strategy.
We introduce the notion of diminution, defined as a selected subset of the
Herbrand universe used to generate a reduced ground program before solving. We
give a formal definition of diminution, analyze its key properties, and study
the complexity of identifying it. We use a specific encoding that enables
off-the-shelf ASP solver to evaluate candidate subsets. Our approach integrates
seamlessly with existing grounders via domain predicates. In extensive
experiments on five benchmarks, applying diminutions selected by our strategy
yields significant performance improvements, reducing grounding time by up to
70% on average and decreasing the size of grounding files by up to 85%. These
results demonstrate that leveraging diminutions constitutes a robust and
general-purpose approach for alleviating the grounding bottleneck in ASP.

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对电子健康记录（EHR）数据的个性化、在线且成本感知的特征选择框架，旨在解决数据稀疏性和异质性挑战，优化医疗资源利用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EHR数据复杂且多模态，传统特征选择方法难以处理其稀疏性和异质性，尤其是需要考虑患者个体差异和特征成本时。

Method: 开发了一种在线获取特征的新框架，结合预算约束和特征变异性成本，为个体患者个性化选择特征。

Result: 框架能够有效管理稀疏和多模态数据，在多样化医疗场景中表现稳健且可扩展。

Conclusion: 该方法支持医生在预算限制下逐步获取最有信息量的特征，提升诊断信心并优化资源利用。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR) have revolutionized healthcare by digitizing
patient data, improving accessibility, and streamlining clinical workflows.
However, extracting meaningful insights from these complex and multimodal
datasets remains a significant challenge for researchers. Traditional feature
selection methods often struggle with the inherent sparsity and heterogeneity
of EHR data, especially when accounting for patient-specific variations and
feature costs in clinical applications. To address these challenges, we propose
a novel personalized, online and cost-aware feature selection framework
tailored specifically for EHR datasets. The features are aquired in an online
fashion for individual patients, incorporating budgetary constraints and
feature variability costs. The framework is designed to effectively manage
sparse and multimodal data, ensuring robust and scalable performance in diverse
healthcare contexts. A primary application of our proposed method is to support
physicians' decision making in patient screening scenarios. By guiding
physicians toward incremental acquisition of the most informative features
within budget constraints, our approach aims to increase diagnostic confidence
while optimizing resource utilization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在安全关键领域，准确评估程序性通信合规性对模拟训练至关重要，但现有方法可能复杂且资源密集。

Method: 通过上下文丰富的提示，基于转录的语音交换，评估协议中每个检查项的合规性，使用LLMs（如LLaMA 2 7B、LLaMA 3 8B和Mistral 7B）在消费级GPU上运行。

Result: 实验表明，提示方法无需任务特定训练即可实现有效的上下文感知推理，分类准确性和一致性评分验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 研究展示了LLMs在增强训练环境中的反馈和自动化评估方面的实用价值。

Abstract: Accurate evaluation of procedural communication compliance is essential in
simulation-based training, particularly in safety-critical domains where
adherence to compliance checklists reflects operational competence. This paper
explores a lightweight, deployable approach using prompt-based inference with
open-source large language models (LLMs) that can run efficiently on
consumer-grade GPUs. We present Prompt-and-Check, a method that uses
context-rich prompts to evaluate whether each checklist item in a protocol has
been fulfilled, solely based on transcribed verbal exchanges. We perform a case
study in the maritime domain with participants performing an identical
simulation task, and experiment with models such as LLama 2 7B, LLaMA 3 8B and
Mistral 7B, running locally on an RTX 4070 GPU. For each checklist item, a
prompt incorporating relevant transcript excerpts is fed into the model, which
outputs a compliance judgment. We assess model outputs against expert-annotated
ground truth using classification accuracy and agreement scores. Our findings
demonstrate that prompting enables effective context-aware reasoning without
task-specific training. This study highlights the practical utility of LLMs in
augmenting debriefing, performance feedback, and automated assessment in
training environments.

Conclusion: 混合机制显著提升基线算法性能，无需针对不同规模问题重新训练。

Abstract: In this research, we propose an iterative learning hybrid optimization solver
developed to strengthen the performance of metaheuristic algorithms in solving
the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). The iterative hybrid mechanism
integrates the proposed Node-Destroyer Model, a machine learning hybrid model
that utilized Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) such identifies and selects customer
nodes to guide the Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) operator within the
metaheuristic optimization frameworks. This model leverages the structural
properties of the problem and solution that can be represented as a graph, to
guide strategic selections concerning node removal. The proposed approach
reduces operational complexity and scales down the search space involved in the
optimization process. The hybrid approach is applied specifically to the CVRP
and does not require retraining across problem instances of different sizes.
The proposed hybrid mechanism is able to improve the performance of baseline
metaheuristic algorithms. Our approach not only enhances the solution quality
for standard CVRP benchmarks but also proves scalability on very large-scale
instances with up to 30,000 customer nodes. Experimental evaluations on
benchmark datasets show that the proposed hybrid mechanism is capable of
improving different baseline algorithms, achieving better quality of solutions
under similar settings.

Abstract: We present Aryabhata 1.0, a compact 7B parameter math reasoning model
optimized for the Indian academic exam, the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE).
Despite rapid progress in large language models (LLMs), current models often
remain unsuitable for educational use. Aryabhata 1.0 is built by merging strong
open-weight reasoning models, followed by supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with
curriculum learning on verified chain-of-thought (CoT) traces curated through
best-of-$n$ rejection sampling. To further boost performance, we apply
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) using A2C objective with
group-relative advantage estimation along with novel exploration strategies
such as Adaptive Group Resizing and Temperature Scaling. Evaluated on both
in-distribution (JEE Main 2025) and out-of-distribution (MATH, GSM8K)
benchmarks, Aryabhata outperforms existing models in accuracy and efficiency,
while offering pedagogically useful step-by-step reasoning. We release
Aryabhata as a foundation model to advance exam-centric, open-source small

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型依赖链式推理（CoT），但在复杂多模态任务中表现不佳且输出冗长，需要更灵活的推理拓扑结构。

Method: 提出TopoAug合成数据管道，结合监督微调和强化学习，训练Qwen2VL模型，并引入Frugal Learning减少输出长度。

Result: 在MATH-V和VLM-S2H上，STELAR-Vision比基础模型准确率提升9.7%，并在多个OOD基准测试中显著优于其他模型。

Conclusion: STELAR-Vision通过拓扑感知推理和高效训练方法，显著提升了模型的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant strides in reasoning, yet
they often struggle with complex multimodal tasks and tend to generate overly
verbose outputs. A key limitation is their reliance on chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning, despite many tasks benefiting from alternative topologies like trees
or graphs. To address this, we introduce STELAR-Vision, a training framework
for topology-aware reasoning. At its core is TopoAug, a synthetic data pipeline
that enriches training with diverse topological structures. Using supervised
fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, we post-train Qwen2VL models with both
accuracy and efficiency in mind. Additionally, we propose Frugal Learning,
which reduces output length with minimal accuracy loss. On MATH-V and VLM-S2H,
STELAR-Vision improves accuracy by 9.7% over its base model and surpasses the
larger Qwen2VL-72B-Instruct by 7.3%. On five out-of-distribution benchmarks, it
outperforms Phi-4-Multimodal-Instruct by up to 28.4% and
LLaMA-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct by up to 13.2%, demonstrating strong
generalization. Compared to Chain-Only training, our approach achieves 4.3%
higher overall accuracy on in-distribution datasets and consistently
outperforms across all OOD benchmarks. We have released datasets, and code will
be available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有社交代理多为场景定制，缺乏通用框架，限制了其跨场景的泛化能力和行为一致性。

Method: 基于社会认知理论，提出包含动机、行动规划和学习模块的框架，指导代理设计。

Result: 实验显示，该框架代理在复杂条件下能重现真实人类行为，偏差比基线低75%，模块消融实验证实各模块的必要性。

Conclusion: 理论驱动的框架显著提升了社交代理的行为真实性和适应性，为通用社交代理设计提供了系统方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have demonstrated strong reasoning
and role-playing capabilities, opening new opportunities for agent-based social
simulations. However, most existing agents' implementations are
scenario-tailored, without a unified framework to guide the design. This lack
of a general social agent limits their ability to generalize across different
social contexts and to produce consistent, realistic behaviors. To address this
challenge, we propose a theory-informed framework that provides a systematic
design process for LLM-based social agents. Our framework is grounded in
principles from Social Cognition Theory and introduces three key modules:
motivation, action planning, and learning. These modules jointly enable agents
to reason about their goals, plan coherent actions, and adapt their behavior
over time, leading to more flexible and contextually appropriate responses.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our theory-driven agents reproduce
realistic human behavior patterns under complex conditions, achieving up to 75%
lower deviation from real-world behavioral data across multiple fidelity
metrics compared to classical generative baselines. Ablation studies further
show that removing motivation, planning, or learning modules increases errors
by 1.5 to 3.2 times, confirming their distinct and essential contributions to
generating realistic and coherent social behaviors.

Motivation: 当前AR代理在处理复杂多步骤任务时，无法有效利用用户的历史交互和偏好，限制了其智能化和个性化能力。

Method: 框架包含四个模块：感知模块（多模态传感器处理）、记忆模块（持久化时空经验存储）、时空推理模块（综合过去与当前上下文）和执行模块（AR通信）。

Result: 提出了实现路线图、未来评估策略及潜在应用案例，展示了框架的实用性和跨领域适用性。

Conclusion: 该工作旨在推动更智能的AR系统研究，将用户交互历史与自适应、上下文感知的任务辅助有效结合。

Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) systems are increasingly integrating foundation
models, such as Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), to provide more
context-aware and adaptive user experiences. This integration has led to the
development of AR agents to support intelligent, goal-directed interactions in
real-world environments. While current AR agents effectively support immediate
tasks, they struggle with complex multi-step scenarios that require
understanding and leveraging user's long-term experiences and preferences. This
limitation stems from their inability to capture, retain, and reason over
historical user interactions in spatiotemporal contexts. To address these
challenges, we propose a conceptual framework for memory-augmented AR agents
that can provide personalized task assistance by learning from and adapting to
user-specific experiences over time. Our framework consists of four
interconnected modules: (1) Perception Module for multimodal sensor processing,
(2) Memory Module for persistent spatiotemporal experience storage, (3)
Spatiotemporal Reasoning Module for synthesizing past and present contexts, and
(4) Actuator Module for effective AR communication. We further present an
implementation roadmap, a future evaluation strategy, a potential target
application and use cases to demonstrate the practical applicability of our
framework across diverse domains. We aim for this work to motivate future
research toward developing more intelligent AR systems that can effectively
bridge user's interaction history with adaptive, context-aware task assistance.

Result: 通过双轴分类（机制与功能），揭示了编辑效果与知识类型的相关性，总结了现有方法的优缺点。

Conclusion: 论文提出了功能分类法，填补了研究空白，并指出了未来研究方向，如提升编辑方法的通用性和准确性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) acquire vast knowledge from large text corpora,
but this information can become outdated or inaccurate. Since retraining is
computationally expensive, knowledge editing offers an efficient alternative --
modifying internal knowledge without full retraining. These methods aim to
update facts precisely while preserving the model's overall capabilities. While
existing surveys focus on the mechanism of editing (e.g., parameter changes vs.
external memory), they often overlook the function of the knowledge being
edited. This survey introduces a novel, complementary function-based taxonomy
to provide a more holistic view. We examine how different mechanisms apply to
various knowledge types -- factual, temporal, conceptual, commonsense, and
social -- highlighting how editing effectiveness depends on the nature of the
target knowledge. By organizing our review along these two axes, we map the
current landscape, outline the strengths and limitations of existing methods,
define the problem formally, survey evaluation tasks and datasets, and conclude
with open challenges and future directions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识图谱通常不完整，链接预测方法用于预测缺失事实，但现有方法缺乏可解释性，且缺乏标准评估协议。

Method: 提出GRainsaCK，一个模块化、可扩展的软件资源，支持从模型训练到解释评估的全流程标准化。

Result: GRainsaCK实现了标准化评估协议，并提供详细文档和教程以促进复用。

Conclusion: GRainsaCK填补了知识图谱解释方法评估的空白，具有模块化和易扩展性。

Abstract: Since Knowledge Graphs are often incomplete, link prediction methods are
adopted for predicting missing facts. Scalable embedding based solutions are
mostly adopted for this purpose, however, they lack comprehensibility, which
may be crucial in several domains. Explanation methods tackle this issue by
identifying supporting knowledge explaining the predicted facts. Regretfully,
evaluating/comparing quantitatively the resulting explanations is challenging
as there is no standard evaluation protocol and overall benchmarking resource.
We fill this important gap by proposing GRainsaCK, a reusable software resource
that fully streamlines all the tasks involved in benchmarking explanations,
i.e., from model training to evaluation of explanations along the same
evaluation protocol. Moreover, GRainsaCK furthers modularity/extensibility by
implementing the main components as functions that can be easily replaced.
Finally, fostering its reuse, we provide extensive documentation including a
tutorial.

Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) has emerged as a promising
solution to address the temporal limitations of Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) in real-world scenarios like news analysis and trending topics.
However, existing approaches often suffer from rigid retrieval strategies and
under-utilization of visual information. To bridge this gap, we propose
E-Agent, an agent framework featuring two key innovations: a mRAG planner
trained to dynamically orchestrate multimodal tools based on contextual
reasoning, and a task executor employing tool-aware execution sequencing to
implement optimized mRAG workflows. E-Agent adopts a one-time mRAG planning
strategy that enables efficient information retrieval while minimizing
redundant tool invocations. To rigorously assess the planning capabilities of
mRAG systems, we introduce the Real-World mRAG Planning (RemPlan) benchmark.
This novel benchmark contains both retrieval-dependent and
retrieval-independent question types, systematically annotated with essential
retrieval tools required for each instance. The benchmark's explicit mRAG
planning annotations and diverse question design enhance its practical
relevance by simulating real-world scenarios requiring dynamic mRAG decisions.
Experiments across RemPlan and three established benchmarks demonstrate
E-Agent's superiority: 13% accuracy gain over state-of-the-art mRAG methods
while reducing redundant searches by 37%.

TL;DR: MLLMs在情感识别任务中表现优于个体人类，但人类集体智慧仍超越AI；人机协作（增强智能）表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索AI（尤其是MLLMs）在情感识别方面的能力，并比较其与人类的表现差异。

Method: 使用RMET和MRMET测试评估MLLMs和人类的情感识别能力，并进行个体与集体表现的对比。

Result: MLLMs在个体水平上优于人类，但人类集体智慧更强；人机协作表现最佳。

Conclusion: MLLMs在情感识别方面有潜力，但人类集体智慧和协作模式是未来发展的关键方向。

Abstract: The ability to discern subtle emotional cues is fundamental to human social
intelligence. As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly common, AI's
ability to recognize and respond to human emotions is crucial for effective
human-AI interactions. In particular, whether such systems can match or surpass
human experts remains to be seen. However, the emotional intelligence of AI,
particularly multimodal large language models (MLLMs), remains largely
unexplored. This study evaluates the emotion recognition abilities of MLLMs
using the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) and its multiracial
counterpart (MRMET), and compares their performance against human participants.
Results show that, on average, MLLMs outperform humans in accurately
identifying emotions across both tests. This trend persists even when comparing
performance across low, medium, and expert-level performing groups. Yet when we
aggregate independent human decisions to simulate collective intelligence,
human groups significantly surpass the performance of aggregated MLLM
predictions, highlighting the wisdom of the crowd. Moreover, a collaborative
approach (augmented intelligence) that combines human and MLLM predictions
achieves greater accuracy than either humans or MLLMs alone. These results
suggest that while MLLMs exhibit strong emotion recognition at the individual
level, the collective intelligence of humans and the synergistic potential of
human-AI collaboration offer the most promising path toward effective emotional
AI. We discuss the implications of these findings for the development of
emotionally intelligent AI systems and future research directions.

TL;DR: 当前工具集成的数学推理系统通常采用单智能体范式，但可能导致认知负荷干扰。作者提出双智能体混合框架，通过分工减少干扰并提升协调性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单智能体范式在处理问题推理、代码生成和执行时可能引发认知负荷干扰，影响性能。

Method: 提出双智能体框架：推理代理负责问题分解，代码代理处理代码生成和执行。训练结合模仿学习和强化学习。

Result: 双智能体框架显著减少了认知干扰，提升了推理与代码生成的协调性。

Conclusion: 分工明确的双智能体设计能有效提升数学推理系统的性能。

Abstract: Current tool-integrated mathematical reasoning systems often adopt a
single-agent paradigm, where one large language model handles problem
reasoning, code generation, and code execution in an integrated workflow. While
this design eases coordination, we hypothesize that it imposes cognitive load
interference, as the agent must interleave long-horizon reasoning with precise
program synthesis. We validate this hypothesis through a controlled comparison
between a reasoning-only agent and a reasoning-plus-code agent, finding that
the latter produces significantly fewer correct reasoning paths despite having
tool-calling capabilities. To address this, we propose a dual-agent hybrid
framework: a Reasoning Agent performs stepwise problem decomposition, and a
Code Agent handles code generation and execution. Training combines imitation
learning and reinforcement learning: the Code Agent receives strong rewards for
matching intermediate ground-truth programs and weaker rewards for valid
execution, while the Reasoning Agent is optimized chiefly via final-answer
accuracy using advantage estimation to credit intermediate steps. This
decoupled role design reduces cognitive interference and promotes stable
reasoning-coding coordination.

models. Compass-Thinker-7B is trained from an open source model through a
specially designed Reinforcement Learning Pipeline. we curate a dataset of 30k
verifiable mathematics problems for the Reinforcement Learning Pipeline. By
configuring data and training settings with different difficulty distributions
for different stages, the potential of the model is gradually released and the
training efficiency is improved. Extensive evaluations show that
Compass-Thinker-7B possesses exceptional reasoning potential, and achieves
superior performance on mathematics compared to the same-sized RL

achieves 40% accuracy.

Method: 提出隐式推理安全性概念，构建数据集SSUI，并通过简单上下文学习（In-Context Learning）验证缓解方法。

Result: 实验表明，简单上下文学习能显著减少隐式多模态威胁。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models face growing safety challenges with multimodal

vulnerability in LVLMs. Benign combined inputs trigger unsafe LVLM outputs due
to flawed or hidden reasoning. To showcase this, we developed Safe Semantics,
Unsafe Interpretations, the first dataset for this critical issue. Our
demonstrations show that even simple In-Context Learning with SSUI
significantly mitigates these implicit multimodal threats, underscoring the
urgent need to improve cross-modal implicit reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究探讨了前景理论（PT）是否适用于大型语言模型（LLMs），以及表达不确定性的认知标记（如“可能”）是否影响其决策行为。通过三阶段实验和新的评估框架，发现PT在LLMs中的适用性不一致，尤其是当不确定性以多种语言形式表达时。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 前景理论（PT）用于描述人类在不确定性下的决策行为，但尚未明确是否适用于LLMs，且认知标记对其决策的影响未被充分研究。

Method: 设计基于经济问卷的三阶段实验，提出更通用的评估框架，引入认知标记的概率值以模拟不确定性，并分析其对LLM决策的影响。

Result: 研究发现PT在LLMs中的建模并不总是可靠，尤其是当不确定性以多样化语言形式表达时。

Conclusion: 前景理论在LLMs中的适用性有限，认知标记的多样性会影响其决策行为，需进一步研究。

Abstract: Prospect Theory (PT) models human decision-making under uncertainty, while
epistemic markers (e.g., maybe) serve to express uncertainty in language.
However, it remains largely unexplored whether Prospect Theory applies to
contemporary Large Language Models and whether epistemic markers, which express
human uncertainty, affect their decision-making behaviour. To address these
research gaps, we design a three-stage experiment based on economic
questionnaires. We propose a more general and precise evaluation framework to
model LLMs' decision-making behaviour under PT, introducing uncertainty through
the empirical probability values associated with commonly used epistemic
markers in comparable contexts. We then incorporate epistemic markers into the
evaluation framework based on their corresponding probability values to examine
their influence on LLM decision-making behaviours. Our findings suggest that
modelling LLMs' decision-making with PT is not consistently reliable,
particularly when uncertainty is expressed in diverse linguistic forms. Our
code is released in https://github.com/HKUST-KnowComp/MarPT.

Result: 在PDDL数据集上性能提升38.6%，并在数据管道设计任务中在5个指标上表现更优。

Conclusion: 通过结构化内在记忆方法，可以显著提升多代理LLM系统在结构化规划任务中的能力。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems built on Large Language Models (LLMs) show exceptional
promise for complex collaborative problem-solving, yet they face fundamental
challenges stemming from context window limitations that impair memory
consistency, role adherence, and procedural integrity. This paper introduces
Intrinsic Memory Agents, a novel framework that addresses these limitations
through structured agent-specific memories that evolve intrinsically with agent
outputs. Specifically, our method maintains role-aligned memory templates that
preserve specialized perspectives while focusing on task-relevant information.
We benchmark our approach on the PDDL dataset, comparing its performance to
existing state-of-the-art multi-agentic memory approaches and showing an
improvement of 38.6\% with the highest token efficiency. An additional
evaluation is performed on a complex data pipeline design task, we demonstrate
that our approach produces higher quality designs when comparing 5 metrics:
scalability, reliability, usability, cost-effectiveness and documentation with
additional qualitative evidence of the improvements. Our findings suggest that
addressing memory limitations through structured, intrinsic approaches can
improve the capabilities of multi-agent LLM systems on structured planning

Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLMs）在社会系统中的广泛应用，其可能放大有害偏见的风险成为关键安全问题。传统方法通常将模型视为黑箱，无法直接干预内部机制。

Method: 1. 训练线性探针检测模型内部激活中的偏见表征；2. 计算“转向向量”对比偏见与中性语句的激活模式，实时干预生成过程。

Result: 实验表明，探针能近乎完美地识别偏见内容，转向向量成功将偏见生成导向中性替代。

Conclusion: 该系统为构建更安全、可解释的LLMs提供了直接且可复现的解决方案。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become more integrated into societal systems,
the risk of them perpetuating and amplifying harmful biases becomes a critical
safety concern. Traditional methods for mitigating bias often rely on data
filtering or post-hoc output moderation, which treat the model as an opaque
black box. In this work, we introduce a complete, end-to-end system that uses
techniques from mechanistic interpretability to both identify and actively
mitigate bias directly within a model's internal workings. Our method involves
two primary stages. First, we train linear "probes" on the internal activations
of a model to detect the latent representations of various biases (e.g.,
gender, race, age). Our experiments on \texttt{gpt2-large} demonstrate that
these probes can identify biased content with near-perfect accuracy, revealing
that bias representations become most salient in the model's later layers.
Second, we leverage these findings to compute "steering vectors" by contrasting
the model's activation patterns for biased and neutral statements. By adding
these vectors during inference, we can actively steer the model's generative
process away from producing harmful, stereotypical, or biased content in
real-time. We demonstrate the efficacy of this activation steering technique,
showing that it successfully alters biased completions toward more neutral
alternatives. We present our work as a robust and reproducible system that
offers a more direct and interpretable approach to building safer and more
accountable LLMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注乘客提交请求后的等待时间预测，而请求前的等待时间预测对乘客行程规划和用户体验同样重要，但尚未被充分研究。

Method: 通过数据驱动的方法分析供需动态对等待时间的影响，并基于特征工程提出FiXGBoost模型。

Result: 在包含3000万条行程记录的真实数据集上，FiXGBoost表现出良好的预测性能和可解释性。

Conclusion: FiXGBoost为拼车系统中的预请求等待时间预测提供了有效的解决方案，并揭示了各因素的重要性。

Abstract: Passenger waiting time prediction plays a critical role in enhancing both
ridesharing user experience and platform efficiency. While most existing
research focuses on post-request waiting time prediction with knowing the
matched driver information, pre-request waiting time prediction (i.e., before
submitting a ride request and without matching a driver) is also important, as
it enables passengers to plan their trips more effectively and enhance the
experience of both passengers and drivers. However, it has not been fully
studied by existing works. In this paper, we take the first step toward
understanding the predictability and explainability of pre-request passenger
waiting time in ridesharing systems. Particularly, we conduct an in-depth
data-driven study to investigate the impact of demand&supply dynamics on
passenger waiting time. Based on this analysis and feature engineering, we
propose FiXGBoost, a novel feature interaction-based XGBoost model designed to
predict waiting time without knowing the assigned driver information. We
further perform an importance analysis to quantify the contribution of each
factor. Experiments on a large-scale real-world ridesharing dataset including
over 30 million trip records show that our FiXGBoost can achieve a good
performance for pre-request passenger waiting time prediction with high
explainability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 轨道电路是铁路运营的关键，其故障可能导致连锁问题。传统方法难以早期检测细微异常，因此需要更先进的预测维护技术。

Method: 利用深度神经网络分类异常，并通过符合性预测提供不确定性估计。

Result: 在10个CVCM故障案例中验证，准确率达99.31%，检测时间在异常出现1%内，置信度达99%。

Conclusion: 该方法可扩展至其他轨道电路和铁路系统，提升运行可靠性。

Abstract: Track circuits are critical for railway operations, acting as the main
signalling sub-system to locate trains. Continuous Variable Current Modulation
(CVCM) is one such technology. Like any field-deployed, safety-critical asset,
it can fail, triggering cascading disruptions. Many failures originate as
subtle anomalies that evolve over time, often not visually apparent in
monitored signals. Conventional approaches, which rely on clear signal changes,
struggle to detect them early. Early identification of failure types is
essential to improve maintenance planning, minimising downtime and revenue
loss. Leveraging deep neural networks, we propose a predictive maintenance
framework that classifies anomalies well before they escalate into failures.
Validated on 10 CVCM failure cases across different installations, the method
is ISO-17359 compliant and outperforms conventional techniques, achieving
99.31% overall accuracy with detection within 1% of anomaly onset. Through
conformal prediction, we provide uncertainty estimates, reaching 99% confidence
with consistent coverage across classes. Given CVCMs global deployment, the
approach is scalable and adaptable to other track circuits and railway systems,
enhancing operational reliability.

Motivation: 现有方法无法可靠地追踪生成内容的来源，导致隐私泄露责任不明确。

Method: SMA通过半黑盒审计和零阶优化机制，结合跨模态归因技术，实现了对生成内容的细粒度来源追踪。

Result: SMA能够准确区分生成内容的来源，首次实现了对图像检索痕迹的成员推断。

Conclusion: SMA为复杂生成系统中的数据来源审计提供了新视角，将关注点从‘数据是否被记忆’转向‘内容来源何处’。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and its Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (MRAG) significantly improve the knowledge coverage and contextual
understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs) by introducing external knowledge
sources. However, retrieval and multimodal fusion obscure content provenance,
rendering existing membership inference methods unable to reliably attribute
generated outputs to pre-training, external retrieval, or user input, thus
undermining privacy leakage accountability
  To address these challenges, we propose the first Source-aware Membership
Audit (SMA) that enables fine-grained source attribution of generated content
in a semi-black-box setting with retrieval control capabilities.To address the
environmental constraints of semi-black-box auditing, we further design an
attribution estimation mechanism based on zero-order optimization, which
robustly approximates the true influence of input tokens on the output through
large-scale perturbation sampling and ridge regression modeling. In addition,
SMA introduces a cross-modal attribution technique that projects image inputs
into textual descriptions via MLLMs, enabling token-level attribution in the
text modality, which for the first time facilitates membership inference on
image retrieval traces in MRAG systems. This work shifts the focus of
membership inference from 'whether the data has been memorized' to 'where the
content is sourced from', offering a novel perspective for auditing data
provenance in complex generative systems.

Abstract: Vision-language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities as
computer-use agents (CUAs) capable of automating diverse computer tasks. As
their commercial potential grows, critical details of the most capable CUA
systems remain closed. As these agents will increasingly mediate digital
interactions and execute consequential decisions on our behalf, the research
community needs access to open CUA frameworks to study their capabilities,
limitations, and risks. To bridge this gap, we propose OpenCUA, a comprehensive
open-source framework for scaling CUA data and foundation models. Our framework
consists of: (1) an annotation infrastructure that seamlessly captures human
computer-use demonstrations; (2) AgentNet, the first large-scale computer-use
task dataset spanning 3 operating systems and 200+ applications and websites;
(3) a scalable pipeline that transforms demonstrations into state-action pairs
with reflective long Chain-of-Thought reasoning that sustain robust performance
gains as data scales. Our end-to-end agent models demonstrate strong
performance across CUA benchmarks. In particular, OpenCUA-32B achieves an
average success rate of 34.8% on OSWorld-Verified, establishing a new
state-of-the-art (SOTA) among open-source models and surpassing OpenAI CUA
(GPT-4o). Further analysis confirms that our approach generalizes well across
domains and benefits significantly from increased test-time computation. We
release our annotation tool, datasets, code, and models to build open

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LLM的代理在信息搜索中难以平衡搜索广度和推理深度，导致覆盖不足和推理中断。

Method: 提出BrowseMaster框架，包含规划器和执行器：规划器制定搜索策略，执行器进行高效检索并提供相关证据。

Result: 在英语和中文基准测试中，BrowseMaster表现优异，得分分别为30.0和46.5，显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: BrowseMaster通过分工作业成功解决了信息搜索中的广度和深度平衡问题，适用于复杂推理任务。

Abstract: Effective information seeking in the vast and ever-growing digital landscape
requires balancing expansive search with strategic reasoning. Current large
language model (LLM)-based agents struggle to achieve this balance due to
limitations in search breadth and reasoning depth, where slow, serial querying
restricts coverage of relevant sources and noisy raw inputs disrupt the
continuity of multi-step reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose
BrowseMaster, a scalable framework built around a programmatically augmented
planner-executor agent pair. The planner formulates and adapts search
strategies based on task constraints, while the executor conducts efficient,
targeted retrieval to supply the planner with concise, relevant evidence. This
division of labor preserves coherent, long-horizon reasoning while sustaining
broad and systematic exploration, overcoming the trade-off that limits existing
agents. Extensive experiments on challenging English and Chinese benchmarks
show that BrowseMaster consistently outperforms open-source and proprietary
baselines, achieving scores of 30.0 on BrowseComp-en and 46.5 on BrowseComp-zh,
which demonstrates its strong capability in complex, reasoning-heavy
information-seeking tasks at scale.

Result: 在EndoAgentBench基准测试中，EndoAgent在5,709个视觉问答对上表现优于通用和医学多模态模型。

Conclusion: EndoAgent展示了强大的灵活性和推理能力，为内窥镜图像诊断提供了新思路。

Abstract: Developing general artificial intelligence (AI) systems to support endoscopic
image diagnosis is an emerging research priority. Existing methods based on
large-scale pretraining often lack unified coordination across tasks and
struggle to handle the multi-step processes required in complex clinical
workflows. While AI agents have shown promise in flexible instruction parsing
and tool integration across domains, their potential in endoscopy remains
underexplored. To address this gap, we propose EndoAgent, the first
memory-guided agent for vision-to-decision endoscopic analysis that integrates
iterative reasoning with adaptive tool selection and collaboration. Built on a
dual-memory design, it enables sophisticated decision-making by ensuring
logical coherence through short-term action tracking and progressively
enhancing reasoning acuity through long-term experiential learning. To support
diverse clinical tasks, EndoAgent integrates a suite of expert-designed tools
within a unified reasoning loop. We further introduce EndoAgentBench, a
benchmark of 5,709 visual question-answer pairs that assess visual
understanding and language generation capabilities in realistic scenarios.
Extensive experiments show that EndoAgent consistently outperforms both general

Abstract: This paper presents MinionsLLM, a novel framework that integrates Large
Language Models (LLMs) with Behavior Trees (BTs) and Formal Grammars to enable
natural language control of multi-agent systems within arbitrary, user-defined
environments. MinionsLLM provides standardized interfaces for defining
environments, agents, and behavioral primitives, and introduces two synthetic
dataset generation methods (Method A and Method B) to fine-tune LLMs for
improved syntactic validity and semantic task relevance. We validate our
approach using Google's Gemma 3 model family at three parameter scales (1B, 4B,
and 12B) and demonstrate substantial gains: Method B increases syntactic
validity to 92.6% and achieves a mean task performance improvement of 33% over
baseline. Notably, our experiments show that smaller models benefit most from
fine-tuning, suggesting promising directions for deploying compact, locally
hosted LLMs in resource-constrained multi-agent control scenarios. The
framework and all resources are released open-source to support reproducibility

them against human annotations. Second, we introduce an adversarial attack
designed to inject gender bias to analyse models responds and ensure model's
fairness and robustness. Both experiments are conducted across three
temperature settings to assess their influence on annotation stability and
alignment with human labels. Our findings reveal that LLM-based annotations
achieve higher inter-annotator agreement than human counterparts, though the
models still exhibit varying degrees of gender bias. We provide a multifaceted
analysis of these outcomes and offer practical recommendations to guide future
research toward more reliable, cost-effective, and bias-aware annotation
methodologies.

*Tarık Saraç,Selin Mergen,Mucahid Kutlu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新颖的“议会辩论”方法，利用多个大型语言模型（LLMs）模拟学术讨论，以识别推文中的科学主张、科学研究的引用或科学实体的提及。尽管在识别科学主张和科学实体方面表现一般，但在检测科学研究引用方面排名第一。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决科学网络话语检测任务（CheckThat! 2025 Task 4a）中的挑战，通过模拟学术讨论提高识别准确性。

Method: 探索了三种辩论方法：单辩论、团队辩论和议会辩论，最终选择议会辩论作为主要模型。

Result: 议会辩论在检测科学研究引用方面表现最佳（排名第一），但在识别科学主张和科学实体方面表现较差（分别排名第8和第9）。

Conclusion: 议会辩论方法在特定任务（如检测科学研究引用）中具有潜力，但在其他任务中需要进一步优化。

Abstract: In this paper, we present our work developed for the scientific web discourse
detection task (Task 4a) of CheckThat! 2025. We propose a novel council debate
method that simulates structured academic discussions among multiple large
language models (LLMs) to identify whether a given tweet contains (i) a
scientific claim, (ii) a reference to a scientific study, or (iii) mentions of
scientific entities. We explore three debating methods: i) single debate, where
two LLMs argue for opposing positions while a third acts as a judge; ii) team
debate, in which multiple models collaborate within each side of the debate;
and iii) council debate, where multiple expert models deliberate together to
reach a consensus, moderated by a chairperson model. We choose council debate
as our primary model as it outperforms others in the development test set.
Although our proposed method did not rank highly for identifying scientific
claims (8th out of 10) or mentions of scientific entities (9th out of 10), it
ranked first in detecting references to scientific studies.

TL;DR: 大型语言模型在认知共情任务中表现优于人类，但在情感共情上表现较差，显示出其在虚拟陪伴和情感支持方面的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型在认知和情感共情方面的表现，以评估其作为虚拟助手和伴侣的潜力。

Method: 使用标准化的心理测试比较小型和大型语言模型在认知和情感共情任务中的表现。

Result: 大型语言模型在认知共情任务中表现优于人类，但在情感共情上显著低于人类。

Conclusion: 语言模型在认知共情上的优势使其适合提供客观的情感支持，但情感共情的不足限制了其完全模拟人类情感的能力。

Abstract: Large language models have become increasingly common, used by millions of
people worldwide in both professional and personal contexts. As these models
continue to advance, they are frequently serving as virtual assistants and
companions. In human interactions, effective communication typically involves
two types of empathy: cognitive empathy (understanding others' thoughts and
emotions) and affective empathy (emotionally sharing others' feelings). In this
study, we investigated both cognitive and affective empathy across several
small (SLMs) and large (LLMs) language models using standardized psychological
tests. Our results revealed that LLMs consistently outperformed humans -
including psychology students - on cognitive empathy tasks. However, despite
their cognitive strengths, both small and large language models showed
significantly lower affective empathy compared to human participants. These
findings highlight rapid advancements in language models' ability to simulate
cognitive empathy, suggesting strong potential for providing effective virtual
companionship and personalized emotional support. Additionally, their high
cognitive yet lower affective empathy allows objective and consistent emotional
support without running the risk of emotional fatigue or bias.

TL;DR: 提出了一种实时新闻故事识别方法，结合文本表示、聚类和在线主题建模技术，用于将新闻文章动态分类到特定故事中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升新闻阅读体验，通过自动将新闻文章归类到相关故事中，帮助用户更高效地获取信息。

Method: 结合文本表示技术、聚类算法和在线主题建模方法（如BERTopic、DBStream和TextClust），动态识别新闻故事。

Result: 在斯洛文尼亚媒体数据集上验证，结果表明该方法能生成合理的故事分类结果。

Conclusion: 提出的实时故事识别方法有效，能够动态处理新闻文章并生成有意义的故事分类。

Abstract: To improve the reading experience, many news sites organize news into topical
collections, called stories. In this work, we present an approach for
implementing real-time story identification for a news monitoring system that
automatically collects news articles as they appear online and processes them
in various ways. Story identification aims to assign each news article to a
specific story that the article is covering. The process is similar to text
clustering and topic modeling, but requires that articles be grouped based on
particular events, places, and people, rather than general text similarity (as
in clustering) or general (predefined) topics (as in topic modeling). We
present an approach to story identification that is capable of functioning in
real time, assigning articles to stories as they are published online. In the
proposed approach, we combine text representation techniques, clustering
algorithms, and online topic modeling methods. We combine various text
representation methods to extract specific events and named entities necessary
for story identification, showing that a mixture of online topic-modeling
approaches such as BERTopic, DBStream, and TextClust can be adapted for story
discovery. We evaluate our approach on a news dataset from Slovene media
covering a period of 1 month. We show that our real-time approach produces
sensible results as judged by human evaluators.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决临床语言模型在长文本电子健康记录中预测和解释不可靠的问题。

Result: 关键词增强方法在所有评估中表现更优，提升机器和人类可解释性。

Conclusion: TT-XAI为临床决策支持提供了可扩展的可信AI路径。

Abstract: Clinical language models often struggle to provide trustworthy predictions
and explanations when applied to lengthy, unstructured electronic health
records (EHRs). This work introduces TT-XAI, a lightweight and effective
framework that improves both classification performance and interpretability
through domain-aware keyword distillation and reasoning with large language
models (LLMs). First, we demonstrate that distilling raw discharge notes into
concise keyword representations significantly enhances BERT classifier
performance and improves local explanation fidelity via a focused variant of
LIME. Second, we generate chain-of-thought clinical explanations using
keyword-guided prompts to steer LLMs, producing more concise and clinically
relevant reasoning. We evaluate explanation quality using deletion-based
fidelity metrics, self-assessment via LLaMA-3 scoring, and a blinded human
study with domain experts. All evaluation modalities consistently favor the
keyword-augmented method, confirming that distillation enhances both machine
and human interpretability. TT-XAI offers a scalable pathway toward
trustworthy, auditable AI in clinical decision support.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体上仇恨言论的快速增长对社会产生了前所未有的影响，需要自动化的检测方法，且希望模型具有透明性。

Method: 提出SCBM模型，利用LLMs将文本映射到基于形容词的抽象表示，再用轻量级分类器处理下游任务，并结合Transformer嵌入提升性能。

Result: 在五个多语言和平台的数据集上，SCBM平均macro-F1为0.69，优于现有方法，且具有高解释性。结合Transformer嵌入后性能提升1.8%。

Conclusion: 基于形容词的概念表示是紧凑、可解释且高效的，适用于仇恨言论识别及其他NLP任务。

Abstract: The rapid increase in hate speech on social media has exposed an
unprecedented impact on society, making automated methods for detecting such
content important. Unlike prior black-box models, we propose a novel
transparent method for automated hate and counter speech recognition, i.e.,
"Speech Concept Bottleneck Model" (SCBM), using adjectives as
human-interpretable bottleneck concepts. SCBM leverages large language models
(LLMs) to map input texts to an abstract adjective-based representation, which
is then sent to a light-weight classifier for downstream tasks. Across five
benchmark datasets spanning multiple languages and platforms (e.g., Twitter,
Reddit, YouTube), SCBM achieves an average macro-F1 score of 0.69 which
outperforms the most recently reported results from the literature on four out
of five datasets. Aside from high recognition accuracy, SCBM provides a high
level of both local and global interpretability. Furthermore, fusing our
adjective-based concept representation with transformer embeddings, leads to a
1.8% performance increase on average across all datasets, showing that the
proposed representation captures complementary information. Our results
demonstrate that adjective-based concept representations can serve as compact,
interpretable, and effective encodings for hate and counter speech recognition.
With adapted adjectives, our method can also be applied to other NLP tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏系统性的评估基准，多模态大语言模型的持续指令调优进展受限，因此提出了MLLM-CTBench以填补这一空白。

Method: 通过结合最终答案准确性和细粒度推理链评估，比较八种持续学习算法，并分析强化学习与监督微调范式，使用16个数据集覆盖六个领域。

Result: 发现模型能力越强遗忘越少，推理链退化慢于最终答案，算法效果依赖模型能力和任务顺序，KL散度约束在强化学习中有效。

Conclusion: MLLM-CTBench为持续指令调优提供了严格标准和实用指导，推动了算法设计和评估的进步。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) rely on continual instruction tuning
to adapt to the evolving demands of real-world applications. However, progress
in this area is hindered by the lack of rigorous and systematic benchmarks. To
address this gap, we present MLLM-CTBench, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark
with three key contributions: (1) Multidimensional Evaluation: We combine final
answer accuracy with fine-grained CoT reasoning quality assessment, enabled by
a specially trained CoT evaluator; (2) Comprehensive Evaluation of Algorithms
and Training Paradigms: We benchmark eight continual learning algorithms across
four major categories and systematically compare reinforcement learning with
supervised fine-tuning paradigms; (3) Carefully Curated Tasks: We select and
organize 16 datasets from existing work, covering six challenging domains. Our
key findings include: (i) Models with stronger general capabilities exhibit
greater robustness to forgetting during continual learning; (ii) Reasoning
chains degrade more slowly than final answers, supporting the hierarchical
forgetting hypothesis; (iii) The effectiveness of continual learning algorithms
is highly dependent on both model capability and task order; (iv) In
reinforcement learning settings, incorporating KL-divergence constraints helps
maintain policy stability and plays a crucial role in mitigating forgetting.
MLLM-CTBench establishes a rigorous standard for continual instruction tuning
of MLLMs and offers practical guidance for algorithm design and evaluation.

Motivation: 探讨对比定位器在大语言模型和视觉语言模型中定位因果相关单元的有效性，并验证其是否准确捕捉任务特定单元。

Method: 使用对比刺激集定位11个LLM和5个VLM中的高激活单元，并通过针对性消融评估其因果作用，比较功能选择单元与低激活或随机选择单元对任务性能的影响。

Result: 低激活单元有时比高激活单元导致更大的性能下降，数学定位器衍生的单元对心理理论任务的负面影响更大。

Conclusion: 对比定位器的因果相关性受到质疑，需更广泛的刺激集和更准确的任务特定单元捕捉方法。

Abstract: This work adapts a neuroscientific contrast localizer to pinpoint causally
relevant units for Theory of Mind (ToM) and mathematical reasoning tasks in
large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs). Across 11 LLMs
and 5 VLMs ranging in size from 3B to 90B parameters, we localize top-activated
units using contrastive stimulus sets and assess their causal role via targeted
ablations. We compare the effect of lesioning functionally selected units
against low-activation and randomly selected units on downstream accuracy
across established ToM and mathematical benchmarks. Contrary to expectations,
low-activation units sometimes produced larger performance drops than the
highly activated ones, and units derived from the mathematical localizer often
impaired ToM performance more than those from the ToM localizer. These findings
call into question the causal relevance of contrast-based localizers and
highlight the need for broader stimulus sets and more accurately capture
task-specific units.

Conclusion: 该框架为教育、科学等高要求领域的LLM评估提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Evaluating the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a critical yet
challenging task, particularly when aiming to avoid subjective assessments.
This paper proposes a framework for leveraging subjective metrics derived from
the class textual materials across different semesters to assess LLM outputs
across various tasks. By utilizing well-defined benchmarks, factual datasets,
and structured evaluation pipelines, the approach ensures consistent,
reproducible, and bias-minimized measurements. The framework emphasizes
automation and transparency in scoring, reducing reliance on human
interpretation while ensuring alignment with real-world applications. This
method addresses the limitations of subjective evaluation methods, providing a
scalable solution for performance assessment in educational, scientific, and
other high-stakes domains.

TL;DR: 论文指出ROUGE作为幻觉检测评估指标存在误导性，提出需采用语义感知的评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的幻觉问题严重，现有评估指标（如ROUGE）与人类判断不一致，需改进。

Method: 通过人类研究和LLM-as-Judge等新指标，对比ROUGE与人类判断的差异，并分析简单启发式方法的有效性。

Result: ROUGE召回率高但精度极低，部分检测方法性能下降达45.9%；简单启发式方法可与复杂技术媲美。

Conclusion: 需采用语义感知的评估框架，以准确衡量幻觉检测性能，确保LLM输出的可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing,
yet their tendency to hallucinate poses serious challenges for reliable
deployment. Despite numerous hallucination detection methods, their evaluations
often rely on ROUGE, a metric based on lexical overlap that misaligns with
human judgments. Through comprehensive human studies, we demonstrate that while
ROUGE exhibits high recall, its extremely low precision leads to misleading
performance estimates. In fact, several established detection methods show
performance drops of up to 45.9\% when assessed using human-aligned metrics
like LLM-as-Judge. Moreover, our analysis reveals that simple heuristics based
on response length can rival complex detection techniques, exposing a
fundamental flaw in current evaluation practices. We argue that adopting
semantically aware and robust evaluation frameworks is essential to accurately
gauge the true performance of hallucination detection methods, ultimately
ensuring the trustworthiness of LLM outputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在多个领域中被广泛用于回答问题，但其在宗教领域（尤其是伊斯兰教法学）的可靠性和准确性尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 研究通过零样本和弃权实验，评估LLM在阿拉伯语和英语中生成伊斯兰教法学裁决的能力，并分析其在不同教法学派中的表现。

Result: GPT-4o在准确性上表现最佳，而Gemini和Fanar在弃权行为上更优。所有模型在阿拉伯语中的性能均下降。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在宗教应用中任务特定评估和谨慎部署LLM的必要性。

Abstract: Despite the increasing usage of Large Language Models (LLMs) in answering
questions in a variety of domains, their reliability and accuracy remain
unexamined for a plethora of domains including the religious domains. In this
paper, we introduce a novel benchmark FiqhQA focused on the LLM generated
Islamic rulings explicitly categorized by the four major Sunni schools of
thought, in both Arabic and English. Unlike prior work, which either overlooks
the distinctions between religious school of thought or fails to evaluate
abstention behavior, we assess LLMs not only on their accuracy but also on
their ability to recognize when not to answer. Our zero-shot and abstention
experiments reveal significant variation across LLMs, languages, and legal
schools of thought. While GPT-4o outperforms all other models in accuracy,
Gemini and Fanar demonstrate superior abstention behavior critical for
minimizing confident incorrect answers. Notably, all models exhibit a
performance drop in Arabic, highlighting the limitations in religious reasoning
for languages other than English. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first study to benchmark the efficacy of LLMs for fine-grained Islamic school
of thought specific ruling generation and to evaluate abstention for Islamic
jurisprudence queries. Our findings underscore the need for task-specific
evaluation and cautious deployment of LLMs in religious applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数学推理基准测试因训练数据污染和接近饱和的准确率而受限，需要一种更严谨的评估方法。

Method: 提出Putnam-AXIOM基准测试，包含522个大学竞赛数学问题，并通过程序化扰动生成100个变体问题，以动态评估模型表现。

Result: 最强模型在原始问题上的准确率为41.9%，但在变体问题上下降了19.6%，表明模型存在记忆现象。

Conclusion: Putnam-AXIOM提供了一种抗污染的动态评估框架，适用于高级数学推理能力的测试。

Abstract: Current mathematical reasoning benchmarks for large language models (LLMs)
are approaching saturation, with some achieving > 90% accuracy, and are
increasingly compromised by training-set contamination. We introduce
Putnam-AXIOM, a benchmark of 522 university-level competition problems drawn
from the prestigious William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition, and
Putnam-AXIOM Variation, an unseen companion set of 100 functional variants
generated by programmatically perturbing variables and constants. The variation
protocol produces an unlimited stream of equally difficult, unseen instances --
yielding a contamination-resilient test bed. On the Original set, OpenAI's
o1-preview -- the strongest evaluated model -- scores 41.9%, but its accuracy
drops by 19.6% (46.8% relative decrease) on the paired Variations. The
remaining eighteen models show the same downward trend, ten of them with
non-overlapping 95% confidence intervals. These gaps suggest memorization and
highlight the necessity of dynamic benchmarks. We complement "boxed" accuracy
with Teacher-Forced Accuracy (TFA), a lightweight metric that directly scores
reasoning traces and automates natural language proof evaluations. Putnam-AXIOM
therefore provides a rigorous, contamination-resilient evaluation framework for
assessing advanced mathematical reasoning of LLMs. Data and evaluation code are
publicly available at https://github.com/brando90/putnam-axiom.

Motivation: 现有LLMs在教育场景中表现不佳，如过早揭示答案、缺乏适应性、易受情绪操控，需要改进。

Method: 采用CoT数据增强，收集真实对话并设计针对性案例，微调开源LLMs。

Result: 微调后的模型在模拟教育场景中表现更优，提供更合适的指导，支持推理过程，并避免过早揭示答案。

Conclusion: CoDAE框架有效提升了LLMs在教育场景中的表现，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed as AI tutors due to
their scalability and potential for personalized instruction. However,
off-the-shelf LLMs often underperform in educational settings: they frequently
reveal answers too readily, fail to adapt their responses to student
uncertainty, and remain vulnerable to emotionally manipulative prompts. To
address these challenges, we introduce CoDAE, a framework that adapts LLMs for
educational use through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data augmentation. We collect
real-world dialogues between students and a ChatGPT-based tutor and enrich them
using CoT prompting to promote step-by-step reasoning and pedagogically aligned
guidance. Furthermore, we design targeted dialogue cases to explicitly mitigate
three key limitations: over-compliance, low response adaptivity, and threat
vulnerability. We fine-tune four open-source LLMs on different variants of the
augmented datasets and evaluate them in simulated educational scenarios using
both automatic metrics and LLM-as-a-judge assessments. Our results show that
models fine-tuned with CoDAE deliver more pedagogically appropriate guidance,
better support reasoning processes, and effectively resist premature answer
disclosure.

Result: Mol-R1在文本分子生成任务中表现优于现有基线。

Conclusion: Mol-R1显著提升了长链思维推理模型在分子生成任务中的表现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), especially Explicit Long Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1 and QWQ, have demonstrated powerful reasoning
capabilities, achieving impressive performance in commonsense reasoning and
mathematical inference. Despite their effectiveness, Long-CoT reasoning models
are often criticized for their limited ability and low efficiency in
knowledge-intensive domains such as molecule discovery. Success in this field
requires a precise understanding of domain knowledge, including molecular
structures and chemical principles, which is challenging due to the inherent
complexity of molecular data and the scarcity of high-quality expert
annotations. To bridge this gap, we introduce Mol-R1, a novel framework
designed to improve explainability and reasoning performance of R1-like
Explicit Long-CoT reasoning LLMs in text-based molecule generation. Our
approach begins with a high-quality reasoning dataset curated through Prior
Regulation via In-context Distillation (PRID), a dedicated distillation
strategy to effectively generate paired reasoning traces guided by prior
regulations. Building upon this, we introduce MoIA, Molecular Iterative
Adaptation, a sophisticated training strategy that iteratively combines
Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) with Reinforced Policy Optimization (RPO),
tailored to boost the reasoning performance of R1-like reasoning models for
molecule discovery. Finally, we examine the performance of Mol-R1 in the
text-based molecule reasoning generation task, showing superior performance
against existing baselines.

Motivation: 解决形态对齐标记化方法是否提升语言模型性能的争议，特别是在复杂形态语言中。

Method: 选择泰卢固语、印地语和英语，从标记化训练到下游任务评估进行全面实验，分析形态对齐和标记化质量的影响。

Result: 形态对齐与语法任务性能呈适度正相关，但标记化算法（如Unigram）对性能影响更大。混合标记化方法在BPE框架中表现更优。

Conclusion: 形态对齐对性能有贡献，但标记化算法的选择更为关键，混合方法在特定框架中表现最佳。

Abstract: Prior work on language modeling showed conflicting findings about whether
morphologically aligned approaches to tokenization improve performance,
particularly for languages with complex morphology. To investigate this, we
select a typologically diverse set of languages: Telugu (agglutinative), Hindi
(primarily fusional with some agglutination), and English (fusional). We
conduct a comprehensive evaluation of language models -- starting from
tokenizer training and extending through the finetuning and downstream task
evaluation. To account for the consistent performance differences observed
across tokenizer variants, we focus on two key factors: morphological alignment
and tokenization quality. To assess morphological alignment of tokenizers in
Telugu, we create a dataset containing gold morpheme segmentations of 600
derivational and 7000 inflectional word forms.
  Our experiments reveal that better morphological alignment correlates
positively -- though moderately -- with performance in syntax-based tasks such
as Parts-of-Speech tagging, Named Entity Recognition and Dependency Parsing.
However, we also find that the tokenizer algorithm (Byte-pair Encoding vs.
Unigram) plays a more significant role in influencing downstream performance
than morphological alignment alone. Naive Unigram tokenizers outperform others
across most settings, though hybrid tokenizers that incorporate morphological
segmentation significantly improve performance within the BPE framework. In
contrast, intrinsic metrics like Corpus Token Count (CTC) and R\'enyi entropy
showed no correlation with downstream performance.

Abstract: Small large language models (LLMs) often face difficulties in aligning output

  Our APO-hinge-zero method, which combines hinge-induced hard-example mining
with the chosen-focused optimization of APO-zero, achieves strong results. In
AlpacaEval, APO-hinge-zero improves the win rate by +2.0 points and the
length-controlled win rate by +1.4 points compared to the APO-zero baseline. In
MT-Bench, our methods maintain competitive performance in diverse categories,
particularly excelling in STEM and Humanities tasks.
  These results demonstrate that simple modifications to preference-based
objectives can significantly enhance small LLM alignment under resource
constraints, offering a practical path toward more efficient deployment.

TL;DR: 论文通过物理学方法研究大型语言模型推理过程中隐藏状态的变化，发现类似能量的量保持恒定，并提出控制方法Jacobian steering。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究模型隐藏状态的变化规律，以提高模型的可解释性和可控性。

Method: 分析20个开源Transformer模型，结合隐藏状态变化率和下一词确定性，提出log-Lagrangian视角和Jacobian steering控制方法。

Result: 随机权重模型比预训练模型更严格地保持能量恒定，Jacobian steering提高了生成文本的语义质量。

Conclusion: 物理学视角为模型的可解释性、异常检测和低风险控制提供了理论基础，有助于模型与人类意图对齐。

Abstract: We take a physics-based approach to studying how the internal hidden states
of large language models change from token to token during inference. Across 20
open-source transformer models (135M-3B parameters), we find that a quantity
combining the rate of change in hidden states and the model's next-token
certainty, analogous to energy in physics, remains nearly constant.
Random-weight models conserve this "energy" more tightly than pre-trained ones,
while training shifts models into a faster, more decisive regime with greater
variability. Using this "log-Lagrangian" view, we derive a control method
called Jacobian steering, which perturbs hidden states in the minimal way
needed to favor a target token. This approach maintained near-constant energy
in two tested models and produced continuations rated higher in semantic
quality than the models' natural outputs. Viewing transformers through this
mechanics lens offers a principled basis for interpretability, anomaly
detection, and low-risk steering. This could help make powerful models more
predictable and aligned with human intent.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于少样本比较回归的可引导多元化模型，用于捕捉多样化的用户偏好，超越了传统的标量奖励方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的大语言模型（LLM）对齐方法（如RLHF）仅能反映平均用户偏好，无法捕捉多样化需求。本文旨在通过多元化对齐方法解决这一问题。

Method: 采用少样本比较回归方法，结合上下文学习和细粒度属性，比较响应选项并做出对齐选择。

Result: 提出的方法在可引导多元化基准测试中表现优异，超越了多种基线方法和前沿技术。

Conclusion: 该研究为多元化对齐提供了新见解，推动了伦理AI的发展，使LLM的使用更公平和具代表性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are currently aligned using techniques such as
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However, these methods use
scalar rewards that can only reflect user preferences on average. Pluralistic
alignment instead seeks to capture diverse user preferences across a set of
attributes, moving beyond just helpfulness and harmlessness. Toward this end,
we propose a steerable pluralistic model based on few-shot comparative
regression that can adapt to individual user preferences. Our approach
leverages in-context learning and reasoning, grounded in a set of fine-grained
attributes, to compare response options and make aligned choices. To evaluate
our algorithm, we also propose two new steerable pluralistic benchmarks by
adapting the Moral Integrity Corpus (MIC) and the HelpSteer2 datasets,
demonstrating the applicability of our approach to value-aligned
decision-making and reward modeling, respectively. Our few-shot comparative
regression approach is interpretable and compatible with different attributes
and LLMs, while outperforming multiple baseline and state-of-the-art methods.
Our work provides new insights and research directions in pluralistic
alignment, enabling a more fair and representative use of LLMs and advancing
the state-of-the-art in ethical AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有压缩方法在保持质量的同时难以实现高效压缩，DeCAL旨在通过改进编码器实现高质量压缩。

Method: DeCAL使用预训练的编码器-解码器语言模型，对编码器进行小修改以最大化压缩质量。

Result: 在2倍压缩下，DeCAL在问答、摘要和多向量检索任务中表现接近未压缩模型，8倍压缩时性能下降较小。

Conclusion: DeCAL在预计算密集表示场景下节省显著，未来可进一步扩展应用范围。

Abstract: This paper introduces DeCAL, a new method for tokenwise compression. DeCAL
uses an encoder-decoder language model pretrained with denoising to learn to
produce high-quality, general-purpose compressed representations by the
encoder. DeCAL applies small modifications to the encoder, with the emphasis on
maximizing compression quality, even at the expense of compute. We show that
DeCAL at 2x compression can match uncompressed on many downstream tasks, with
usually only minor dropoff in metrics up to 8x compression, among
question-answering, summarization, and multi-vector retrieval tasks. DeCAL
offers significant savings where pre-computed dense representations can be
utilized, and we believe the approach can be further developed to be more
broadly applicable.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 抑郁症预测缺乏高质量数据集，阻碍了应用。

Method: 使用3,699篇自传体叙事训练DepressLLM，引入SToPS模块提升性能。

Result: AUC达0.789，高置信度样本AUC提升至0.904，验证了模型在异构数据上的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 可解释AI有望实现抑郁症早期诊断，但需进一步优化模型和数据。

Abstract: Advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled a wide range of
applications. However, depression prediction is hindered by the lack of
large-scale, high-quality, and rigorously annotated datasets. This study
introduces DepressLLM, trained and evaluated on a novel corpus of 3,699
autobiographical narratives reflecting both happiness and distress. DepressLLM
provides interpretable depression predictions and, via its Score-guided Token
Probability Summation (SToPS) module, delivers both improved classification
performance and reliable confidence estimates, achieving an AUC of 0.789, which
rises to 0.904 on samples with confidence $\geq$ 0.95. To validate its
robustness to heterogeneous data, we evaluated DepressLLM on in-house datasets,
including an Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) corpus of daily stress and
mood recordings, and on public clinical interview data. Finally, a psychiatric
review of high-confidence misclassifications highlighted key model and data
limitations that suggest directions for future refinements. These findings
demonstrate that interpretable AI can enable earlier diagnosis of depression
and underscore the promise of medical AI in psychiatry.

Motivation: RAG系统在处理粤语等方言时面临数据稀缺和语言变异性问题，需通过PEFT方法提升效率和准确性。

Method: 评估了LoRA在RAG框架中的集成，比较了不同PEFT方法，并分析了合成数据生成、用户反馈等策略。

Result: 动态和集成LoRA方法显著减少参数且不损失性能，但在保留语言细节和实时反馈方面仍有不足。

Conclusion: PEFT增强的RAG系统在特定领域任务中前景广阔，未来需关注方言真实性、动态适应性和可扩展性。

Abstract: This review examines recent advances in Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning
(PEFT), with a focus on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), to optimize
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems like Qwen3, DeepSeek, and Kimi.
These systems face challenges in understanding and generating authentic
Cantonese colloquial expressions due to limited annotated data and linguistic
variability. The review evaluates the integration of LoRA within RAG
frameworks, benchmarks PEFT methods for retrieval and generation accuracy,
identify domain adaptation strategies under limited data, and compares
fine-tuning techniques aimed at improving semantic fidelity under data-scarce
conditions. A systematic analysis of recent studies employing diverse LoRA
variants, synthetic data generation, user feedback integration, and adaptive
parameter allocation was conducted to assess their impact on computational
efficiency, retrieval precision, linguistic authenticity, and scalability.
Findings reveal that dynamic and ensemble LoRA adaptations significantly reduce
trainable parameters without sacrificing retrieval accuracy and generation
quality in dialectal contexts. However, limitations remain in fully preserving
fine-grained linguistic nuances, especially for low-resource settings like
Cantonese. The integration of real-time user feedback and domain-specific data
remains underdeveloped, limiting model adaptability and personalization. While
selective parameter freezing and nonlinear adaptation methods offer better
trade-offs between efficiency and accuracy, their robustness at scale remains
an open challenge. This review highlights the promise of PEFT-enhanced RAG
systems for domain-specific language tasks and calls for future work targeting
dialectal authenticity, dynamic adaptation, and scalable fine-tuning pipelines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有强化学习（RL）研究在窄领域任务上的局限性，适应现实世界复杂多样的推理需求。

Method: 开发InternBootcamp框架，通过自动化代理工作流和手动验证协议快速扩展任务范围，支持任务难度配置和客观评估。

Result: 前沿模型在多项推理任务中表现不足，但通过InternBootcamp训练显著提升性能，32B模型在Bootcamp-EVAL和其他基准测试中达到最优。

Conclusion: 任务规模扩展（task scaling）是实现通用推理能力的关键路径，InternBootcamp为RL研究和模型优化提供了重要基础设施。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence by
enabling complex reasoning capabilities. While recent advancements in
reinforcement learning (RL) have primarily focused on domain-specific reasoning
tasks (e.g., mathematics or code generation), real-world reasoning scenarios
often require models to handle diverse and complex environments that
narrow-domain benchmarks cannot fully capture. To address this gap, we present
InternBootcamp, an open-source framework comprising 1000+ domain-diverse task
environments specifically designed for LLM reasoning research. Our codebase
offers two key functionalities: (1) automated generation of unlimited
training/testing cases with configurable difficulty levels, and (2) integrated
verification modules for objective response evaluation. These features make
InternBootcamp fundamental infrastructure for RL-based model optimization,
synthetic data generation, and model evaluation. Although manually developing
such a framework with enormous task coverage is extremely cumbersome, we
accelerate the development procedure through an automated agent workflow
supplemented by manual validation protocols, which enables the task scope to
expand rapidly. % With these bootcamps, we further establish Bootcamp-EVAL, an
automatically generated benchmark for comprehensive performance assessment.
Evaluation reveals that frontier models still underperform in many reasoning
tasks, while training with InternBootcamp provides an effective way to
significantly improve performance, leading to our 32B model that achieves
state-of-the-art results on Bootcamp-EVAL and excels on other established
benchmarks. In particular, we validate that consistent performance gains come
from including more training tasks, namely \textbf{task scaling}, over two
orders of magnitude, offering a promising route towards capable reasoning
generalist.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有移动代理方法仅关注显式意图流（如步骤序列），忽视隐式意图流（如个人偏好），难以构建个性化代理。

Method: 收集MobileIAR数据集，提出IFRAgent框架，结合显式意图流构建SOP库和隐式意图流构建习惯库，利用检索增强生成生成个性化查询。

Result: IFRAgent在意图对齐率和步骤完成率上分别平均提升6.79%和5.30%，相对改进达32.06%和26.34%。

Conclusion: IFRAgent通过显式和隐式意图流的结合，显著提升了移动代理与人类意图的对齐能力。

Abstract: As multimodal large language models advance rapidly, the automation of mobile
tasks has become increasingly feasible through the use of mobile-use agents
that mimic human interactions from graphical user interface. To further enhance
mobile-use agents, previous studies employ demonstration learning to improve
mobile-use agents from human demonstrations. However, these methods focus
solely on the explicit intention flows of humans (e.g., step sequences) while
neglecting implicit intention flows (e.g., personal preferences), which makes
it difficult to construct personalized mobile-use agents. In this work, to
evaluate the \textbf{I}ntention \textbf{A}lignment \textbf{R}ate between
mobile-use agents and humans, we first collect \textbf{MobileIAR}, a dataset
containing human-intent-aligned actions and ground-truth actions. This enables
a comprehensive assessment of the agents' understanding of human intent. Then
we propose \textbf{IFRAgent}, a framework built upon \textbf{I}ntention
\textbf{F}low \textbf{R}ecognition from human demonstrations. IFRAgent analyzes
explicit intention flows from human demonstrations to construct a query-level
vector library of standard operating procedures (SOP), and analyzes implicit
intention flows to build a user-level habit repository. IFRAgent then leverages
a SOP extractor combined with retrieval-augmented generation and a query
rewriter to generate personalized query and SOP from a raw ambiguous query,
enhancing the alignment between mobile-use agents and human intent.
Experimental results demonstrate that IFRAgent outperforms baselines by an
average of 6.79\% (32.06\% relative improvement) in human intention alignment
rate and improves step completion rates by an average of 5.30\% (26.34\%
relative improvement). The codes are available at

Conclusion: LLMs微调后在ABSA任务中表现优异，但需进一步改进零样本和少样本能力。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) show promise for various tasks, their

fine-tuned for ABSA, focusing on LLaMA-based models. We evaluate the
performance across four tasks and eight English datasets, finding that the
fine-tuned Orca~2 model surpasses state-of-the-art results in all tasks.
However, all models struggle in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios compared to
fully fine-tuned ones. Additionally, we conduct error analysis to identify
challenges faced by fine-tuned models.

emotion label from six possible classes for a given tweet in one of five

binary and numerical formats. Our proposed approach revolves around fine-tuning
quantized large language models, specifically Orca~2, with low-rank adapters

enhance performance through machine translation for both subtasks and trigger
word switching for the second subtask. The system achieves excellent
performance, ranking 1st in numerical trigger words detection, 3rd in binary
trigger words detection, and 7th in emotion detection.

Abstract: Transforming unstructured text into structured data is a complex task,
requiring semantic understanding, reasoning, and structural comprehension.
While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential, they often struggle with
handling ambiguous or domain-specific data, maintaining table structure,
managing long inputs, and addressing numerical reasoning. This paper proposes
an efficient system for LLM-driven text-to-table generation that leverages
novel prompting techniques. Specifically, the system incorporates two key
strategies: breaking down the text-to-table task into manageable, guided
sub-tasks and refining the generated tables through iterative self-feedback. We
show that this custom task decomposition allows the model to address the
problem in a stepwise manner and improves the quality of the generated table.
Furthermore, we discuss the benefits and potential risks associated with
iterative self-feedback on the generated tables while highlighting the
trade-offs between enhanced performance and computational cost. Our methods
achieve strong results compared to baselines on two complex text-to-table
generation datasets available in the public domain.

Result: TopXGen显著提升了LLMs在低资源语言翻译中的性能。

Conclusion: TopXGen为低资源语言翻译提供了有效的数据增强方法，提升了LLMs的表现。

Abstract: LLMs have been shown to perform well in machine translation (MT) with the use
of in-context learning (ICL), rivaling supervised models when translating into
high-resource languages (HRLs). However, they lag behind when translating into
low-resource language (LRLs). Example selection via similarity search and
supervised fine-tuning help. However the improvements they give are limited by
the size, quality and diversity of existing parallel datasets. A common
technique in low-resource MT is synthetic parallel data creation, the most
frequent of which is backtranslation, whereby existing target-side texts are
automatically translated into the source language. However, this assumes the
existence of good quality and relevant target-side texts, which are not readily
available for many LRLs. In this paper, we present \textsc{TopXGen}, an
LLM-based approach for the generation of high quality and topic-diverse data in
multiple LRLs, which can then be backtranslated to produce useful and diverse
parallel texts for ICL and fine-tuning. Our intuition is that while LLMs
struggle to translate into LRLs, their ability to translate well into HRLs and
their multilinguality enable them to generate good quality, natural-sounding
target-side texts, which can be translated well into a high-resource source
language. We show that \textsc{TopXGen} boosts LLM translation performance
during fine-tuning and in-context learning. Code and outputs are available at

Abstract: Voice-controlled interfaces can support older adults in clinical contexts,
with chatbots being a prime example, but reliable Automatic Speech Recognition
(ASR) for underrepresented groups remains a bottleneck. This study evaluates
state-of-the-art ASR models on language use of older Dutch adults, who
interacted with the Welzijn.AI chatbot designed for geriatric contexts. We
benchmark generic multilingual ASR models, and models fine-tuned for Dutch
spoken by older adults, while also considering processing speed. Our results
show that generic multilingual models outperform fine-tuned models, which
suggests recent ASR models can generalise well out of the box to realistic
datasets. Furthermore, our results suggest that truncating existing
architectures is helpful in balancing the accuracy-speed trade-off, though we
also identify some cases with high WER due to hallucinations.

Conclusion: 总结了最新进展、开放挑战及未来研究方向。

Abstract: As text generation has become a core capability of modern Large Language
Models (LLMs), it underpins a wide range of downstream applications. However,
most existing LLMs rely on autoregressive (AR) generation, producing one token
at a time based on previously generated context-resulting in limited generation
speed due to the inherently sequential nature of the process. To address this
challenge, an increasing number of researchers have begun exploring parallel
text generation-a broad class of techniques aimed at breaking the
token-by-token generation bottleneck and improving inference efficiency.
Despite growing interest, there remains a lack of comprehensive analysis on
what specific techniques constitute parallel text generation and how they
improve inference performance. To bridge this gap, we present a systematic
survey of parallel text generation methods. We categorize existing approaches
into AR-based and Non-AR-based paradigms, and provide a detailed examination of
the core techniques within each category. Following this taxonomy, we assess
their theoretical trade-offs in terms of speed, quality, and efficiency, and
examine their potential for combination and comparison with alternative
acceleration strategies. Finally, based on our findings, we highlight recent
advancements, identify open challenges, and outline promising directions for
future research in parallel text generation.

Motivation: 现有方法只能让LLM模仿浅层和不稳定的风格模式，无法精确且一致地体现所需特质。

Method: 基于心理学理论，IROTE自动生成并优化包含自我感知经验的文本自我反思，通过信息论目标迭代优化，增强LLM行为与目标特质的联系。

Result: 实验表明，IROTE生成的单一自我反思能在多样化任务中稳定诱导LLM模仿目标特质，优于现有基线。

Conclusion: IROTE通过自我反思优化，实现了LLM对人类特质的稳定和可迁移激发。

Abstract: Trained on various human-authored corpora, Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated a certain capability of reflecting specific human-like traits
(e.g., personality or values) by prompting, benefiting applications like
personalized LLMs and social simulations. However, existing methods suffer from
the superficial elicitation problem: LLMs can only be steered to mimic shallow
and unstable stylistic patterns, failing to embody the desired traits precisely
and consistently across diverse tasks like humans. To address this challenge,
we propose IROTE, a novel in-context method for stable and transferable trait
elicitation. Drawing on psychological theories suggesting that traits are
formed through identity-related reflection, our method automatically generates
and optimizes a textual self-reflection within prompts, which comprises
self-perceived experience, to stimulate LLMs' trait-driven behavior. The
optimization is performed by iteratively maximizing an information-theoretic
objective that enhances the connections between LLMs' behavior and the target
trait, while reducing noisy redundancy in reflection without any fine-tuning,
leading to evocative and compact trait reflection. Extensive experiments across
three human trait systems manifest that one single IROTE-generated
self-reflection can induce LLMs' stable impersonation of the target trait
across diverse downstream tasks beyond simple questionnaire answering,

Abstract: Medical Lay Language Generation (MLLG) plays a vital role in improving the
accessibility of complex scientific content for broader audiences. Recent
literature to MLLG commonly employ parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods such
as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using
paired expert-lay language datasets. However, LoRA struggles with the
challenges posed by multi-source heterogeneous MLLG datasets. Specifically,
through a series of exploratory experiments, we reveal that standard LoRA fail
to meet the requirement for semantic fidelity and diverse lay-style generation
in MLLG task. To address these limitations, we propose Magical, an asymmetric
LoRA architecture tailored for MLLG under heterogeneous data scenarios. Magical
employs a shared matrix $A$ for abstractive summarization, along with multiple
isolated matrices $B$ for diverse lay-style generation. To preserve semantic
fidelity during the lay language generation process, Magical introduces a
Semantic Invariance Constraint to mitigate semantic subspace shifts on matrix
$A$. Furthermore, to better adapt to diverse lay-style generation, Magical
incorporates the Recommendation-guided Switch, an externally interface to
prompt the LLM to switch between different matrices $B$. Experimental results
on three real-world lay language generation datasets demonstrate that Magical
consistently outperforms prompt-based methods, vanilla LoRA, and its recent
variants, while also reducing trainable parameters by 31.66%.

Motivation: 科学文献问答对科学发现至关重要，但目前的两阶段RAG-LLMs框架（尤其是重排器）的潜力和局限性尚未充分探索。

Method: 开发了SciRerankBench基准，包含三种问题-上下文-答案（Q-C-A）对（噪声上下文、语义相似但逻辑无关上下文、反事实上下文），用于评估重排器的性能。

Result: 通过系统评估13种重排器在五种LLMs上的表现，揭示了其优势和局限性。

Conclusion: SciRerankBench是首个专门评估RAG-LLMs中重排器的基准，为未来研究提供了重要指导。

Abstract: Scientific literature question answering is a pivotal step towards new
scientific discoveries. Recently, \textit{two-stage} retrieval-augmented
generated large language models (RAG-LLMs) have shown impressive advancements
in this domain. Such a two-stage framework, especially the second stage
(reranker), is particularly essential in the scientific domain, where subtle
differences in terminology may have a greatly negative impact on the final
factual-oriented or knowledge-intensive answers. Despite this significant
progress, the potential and limitations of these works remain unexplored. In
this work, we present a Scientific Rerank-oriented RAG Benchmark
(SciRerankBench), for evaluating rerankers within RAG-LLMs systems, spanning
five scientific subjects. To rigorously assess the reranker performance in
terms of noise resilience, relevance disambiguation, and factual consistency,
we develop three types of question-context-answer (Q-C-A) pairs, i.e., Noisy
Contexts (NC), Semantically Similar but Logically Irrelevant Contexts (SSLI),
and Counterfactual Contexts (CC). Through systematic evaluation of 13 widely
used rerankers on five families of LLMs, we provide detailed insights into
their relative strengths and limitations. To the best of our knowledge,
SciRerankBench is the first benchmark specifically developed to evaluate
rerankers within RAG-LLMs, which provides valuable observations and guidance
for their future development.

Conclusion: DevNous提供了一个有效的架构模式，并建立了该问题领域的首个实证基准和公开数据集。

Abstract: The manual translation of unstructured team dialogue into the structured
artifacts required for Information Technology (IT) project governance is a
critical bottleneck in modern information systems management. We introduce
DevNous, a Large Language Model-based (LLM) multi-agent expert system, to
automate this unstructured-to-structured translation process. DevNous
integrates directly into team chat environments, identifying actionable intents
from informal dialogue and managing stateful, multi-turn workflows for core
administrative tasks like automated task formalization and progress summary
synthesis. To quantitatively evaluate the system, we introduce a new benchmark
of 160 realistic, interactive conversational turns. The dataset was manually
annotated with a multi-label ground truth and is publicly available. On this
benchmark, DevNous achieves an exact match turn accuracy of 81.3\% and a
multiset F1-Score of 0.845, providing strong evidence for its viability. The
primary contributions of this work are twofold: (1) a validated architectural
pattern for developing ambient administrative agents, and (2) the introduction
of the first robust empirical baseline and public benchmark dataset for this
challenging problem domain.

TL;DR: 论文提出ARoG框架，通过关系中心抽象和结构导向抽象策略，解决匿名知识图谱在RAG系统中的隐私保护和检索问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs存在幻觉和知识不完整问题，RAG通过整合外部知识（如KGs）解决这些问题。然而，使用私有KGs会带来隐私风险，尤其是在匿名实体无法被LLMs理解的情况下。

Method: 提出ARoG框架，包含两种策略：1) 通过动态捕获相邻关系语义将匿名实体抽象为高层概念；2) 将自然语言问题转化为结构化抽象概念路径。

Result: 在三个数据集上的实验表明，ARoG在性能和隐私鲁棒性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: ARoG有效解决了匿名KGs在RAG系统中的隐私保护和检索问题，为隐私敏感的RAG应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: LLMs often suffer from hallucinations and outdated or incomplete knowledge.
RAG is proposed to address these issues by integrating external knowledge like
that in KGs into LLMs. However, leveraging private KGs in RAG systems poses
significant privacy risks due to the black-box nature of LLMs and potential
insecure data transmission, especially when using third-party LLM APIs lacking
transparency and control. In this paper, we investigate the privacy-protected
RAG scenario for the first time, where entities in KGs are anonymous for LLMs,
thus preventing them from accessing entity semantics. Due to the loss of
semantics of entities, previous RAG systems cannot retrieve question-relevant
knowledge from KGs by matching questions with the meaningless identifiers of
anonymous entities. To realize an effective RAG system in this scenario, two
key challenges must be addressed: (1) How can anonymous entities be converted
into retrievable information. (2) How to retrieve question-relevant anonymous
entities. Hence, we propose a novel ARoG framework including relation-centric
abstraction and structure-oriented abstraction strategies. For challenge (1),
the first strategy abstracts entities into high-level concepts by dynamically
capturing the semantics of their adjacent relations. It supplements meaningful
semantics which can further support the retrieval process. For challenge (2),
the second strategy transforms unstructured natural language questions into
structured abstract concept paths. These paths can be more effectively aligned
with the abstracted concepts in KGs, thereby improving retrieval performance.
To guide LLMs to effectively retrieve knowledge from KGs, the two strategies
strictly protect privacy from being exposed to LLMs. Experiments on three
datasets demonstrate that ARoG achieves strong performance and
privacy-robustness.

TL;DR: 提出了一种自动化环境构建流程和可验证奖励机制，显著提升了大型语言模型（LLM）的工具使用性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏专门为工具使用设计的高效强化学习框架，导致LLM在工具使用方面的进展受限。

Method: 开发了自动化环境构建流程（包括场景分解、文档生成、功能集成、复杂度扩展和本地化部署）和可验证奖励机制。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了LLM的工具使用性能，且不影响其通用能力。

Conclusion: 该方法通过改进上下文理解和推理能力，推动了LLM在工具使用方面的进展。

Abstract: Effective tool use is essential for large language models (LLMs) to interact
meaningfully with their environment. However, progress is limited by the lack
of efficient reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks specifically designed for
tool use, due to challenges in constructing stable training environments and
designing verifiable reward mechanisms. To address this, we propose an
automated environment construction pipeline, incorporating scenario
decomposition, document generation, function integration, complexity scaling,
and localized deployment. This enables the creation of high-quality training
environments that provide detailed and measurable feedback without relying on
external tools. Additionally, we introduce a verifiable reward mechanism that
evaluates both the precision of tool use and the completeness of task
execution. When combined with trajectory data collected from the constructed
environments, this mechanism integrates seamlessly with standard RL algorithms
to facilitate feedback-driven model training. Experiments on LLMs of varying
scales demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the models'
tool-use performance without degrading their general capabilities, regardless
of inference modes or training algorithms. Our analysis suggests that these
gains result from improved context understanding and reasoning, driven by
updates to the lower-layer MLP parameters in models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型因固定训练数据导致知识过时和预测中时序泄漏的问题。

Method: 预训练多个GPT风格专家模型，分别针对不同时间段数据，通过TiMoE（时间感知混合专家）在推理时屏蔽未来信息，确保因果有效性。

Result: TiMoE在8个标准NLP任务和TSQA基准上表现优于单时段专家模型，未来知识错误减少15%。

Conclusion: 分时段预训练和因果路由是保持LLMs时序有效性的简单有效方法，同时不影响通用性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained on fixed snapshots of the
web, which means that their knowledge becomes stale and their predictions risk
temporal leakage: relying on information that lies in the future relative to a
query. We tackle this problem by pre-training from scratch a set of GPT-style
experts on disjoint two-year slices of a 2013-2024 corpus and combining them
through TiMoE, a Time-aware Mixture of Language Experts. At inference time,
TiMoE masks all experts whose training window ends after the query timestamp
and merges the remaining log-probabilities in a shared space, guaranteeing
strict causal validity while retaining the breadth of multi-period knowledge.
We also release TSQA, a 10k-question benchmark whose alternatives are
explicitly labelled as past, future or irrelevant, allowing fine-grained
measurement of temporal hallucinations. Experiments on eight standard NLP tasks
plus TSQA show that a co-adapted TiMoE variant matches or exceeds the best
single-period expert and cuts future-knowledge errors by up to 15%. Our results
demonstrate that modular, time-segmented pre-training paired with causal
routing is a simple yet effective path toward LLMs that stay chronologically
grounded without sacrificing general performance much. We open source our code
at TiMoE (Github): https://github.com/epfml/TiMoE

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未能充分评估LLMs对非数学扰动的敏感性，因此需要一种更准确的方法来衡量其数学推理能力。

Method: 通过创建PutnamGAP基准数据集，包含数学等价但语言和参数变化的问题，评估多种代表性LLMs的鲁棒性。

Result: 在18个商业和开源模型中，性能显著下降，尤其是核心步骤变体问题。OpenAI的O3模型在原始问题上得分49%，但在变体上分别下降4%和10.5%。

Conclusion: 新评估方法有效深化了对LLMs鲁棒性的理解，并为提升其数学推理能力提供了新见解。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a systematic framework beyond conventional method
to assess LLMs' mathematical-reasoning robustness by stress-testing them on
advanced math problems that are mathematically equivalent but with linguistic
and parametric variation. These transformations allow us to measure the
sensitivity of LLMs to non-mathematical perturbations, thereby enabling a more
accurate evaluation of their mathematical reasoning capabilities. Using this
new evaluation methodology, we created PutnamGAP, a new benchmark dataset with
multiple mathematically-equivalent variations of competition-level math
problems. With the new dataset, we evaluate multiple families of representative
LLMs and examine their robustness. Across 18 commercial and open-source models
we observe sharp performance degradation on the variants. OpenAI's flagship
reasoning model, O3, scores 49 % on the originals but drops by 4 percentage
points on surface variants, and by 10.5 percentage points on core-step-based
variants, while smaller models fare far worse. Overall, the results show that
the proposed new evaluation methodology is effective for deepening our
understanding of the robustness of LLMs and generating new insights for further
improving their mathematical reasoning capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在广泛应用中表现出色，但其编码和复制意识形态偏见的倾向仍引发担忧。

Method: 基于政治罗盘测试（PCT），采用对比对提取和比较模型（如Mistral和DeepSeek）的隐藏层激活，并引入全面的激活提取流程进行分层分析。

Result: 研究发现解码器型LLM在各层中系统性地编码了表征偏见，可通过基于转向向量的方法有效减轻。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了LLM中政治偏见的编码方式，并提供了超越表面干预的去偏见原则性方法。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled their
widespread use across diverse real-world applications. However, concerns remain
about their tendency to encode and reproduce ideological biases, particularly
along political and economic dimensions. In this paper, we propose a framework
for probing and mitigating such biases in decoder-based LLMs through analysis
of internal model representations. Grounded in the Political Compass Test
(PCT), our method uses contrastive pairs to extract and compare hidden layer
activations from models like Mistral and DeepSeek. We introduce a comprehensive
activation extraction pipeline capable of layer-wise analysis across multiple
ideological axes, revealing meaningful disparities linked to political framing.
Our results show that decoder LLMs systematically encode representational bias
across layers, which can be leveraged for effective steering vector-based
mitigation. This work provides new insights into how political bias is encoded
in LLMs and offers a principled approach to debiasing beyond surface-level
output interventions.

Abstract: Understanding biases and stereotypes encoded in the weights of Large Language
Models (LLMs) is crucial for developing effective mitigation strategies. Biased
behaviour is often subtle and non-trivial to isolate, even when deliberately
elicited, making systematic analysis and debiasing particularly challenging. To
address this, we introduce BiasGym, a simple, cost-effective, and generalizable
framework for reliably injecting, analyzing, and mitigating conceptual
associations within LLMs. BiasGym consists of two components: BiasInject, which
injects specific biases into the model via token-based fine-tuning while
keeping the model frozen, and BiasScope, which leverages these injected signals
to identify and steer the components responsible for biased behavior. Our
method enables consistent bias elicitation for mechanistic analysis, supports
targeted debiasing without degrading performance on downstream tasks, and
generalizes to biases unseen during training. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of BiasGym in reducing real-world stereotypes (e.g., people from a country
being `reckless drivers') and in probing fictional associations (e.g., people
from a country having `blue skin'), showing its utility for both safety
interventions and interpretability research.

Motivation: 传统放射学报告质量评估依赖资深医生人工评分，成本高且易受主观因素影响。

Method: Sqator通过分析初级与资深报告间的修订文本片段，计算重要性得分并合并为最终评分。

Result: 在12,013份报告上的实验表明，Sqator评分与人工评分一致且具有竞争力。

Conclusion: Sqator能有效替代人工评分，提供高效且客观的质量评估。

Abstract: Quality Assurance (QA) for radiology reports refers to judging whether the
junior reports (written by junior doctors) are qualified. The QA scores of one
junior report are given by the senior doctor(s) after reviewing the image and
junior report. This process requires intensive labor costs for senior doctors.
Additionally, the QA scores may be inaccurate for reasons like diagnosis bias,
the ability of senior doctors, and so on. To address this issue, we propose a
Span-level Quality Assurance EvaluaTOR (Sqator) to mark QA scores
automatically. Unlike the common document-level semantic comparison method, we
try to analyze the semantic difference by exploring more fine-grained text
spans. Unlike the common document-level semantic comparison method, we try to
analyze the semantic difference by exploring more fine-grained text spans.
Specifically, Sqator measures QA scores by measuring the importance of revised
spans between junior and senior reports, and outputs the final QA scores by
merging all revised span scores. We evaluate Sqator using a collection of
12,013 radiology reports. Experimental results show that Sqator can achieve
competitive QA scores. Moreover, the importance scores of revised spans can be
also consistent with the judgments of senior doctors.

Result: 实验显示LLMs编码了西方主导偏见和文化扁平化，低资源文化因训练数据少而偏见较少。

Conclusion: 为未来减轻文化偏见和提升LLMs文化理解奠定基础，代码和数据公开。

Abstract: The growing deployment of large language models (LLMs) across diverse
cultural contexts necessitates a better understanding of how the
overgeneralization of less documented cultures within LLMs' representations
impacts their cultural understanding. Prior work only performs extrinsic
evaluation of LLMs' cultural competence, without accounting for how LLMs'
internal mechanisms lead to cultural (mis)representation. To bridge this gap,
we propose Culturescope, the first mechanistic interpretability-based method
that probes the internal representations of LLMs to elicit the underlying
cultural knowledge space. CultureScope utilizes a patching method to extract
the cultural knowledge. We introduce a cultural flattening score as a measure
of the intrinsic cultural biases. Additionally, we study how LLMs internalize
Western-dominance bias and cultural flattening, which allows us to trace how
cultural biases emerge within LLMs. Our experimental results reveal that LLMs
encode Western-dominance bias and cultural flattening in their cultural
knowledge space. We find that low-resource cultures are less susceptible to
cultural biases, likely due to their limited training resources. Our work
provides a foundation for future research on mitigating cultural biases and
enhancing LLMs' cultural understanding. Our codes and data used for experiments
are publicly available.

Result: 在多个任务上验证，ASPD实现了最高3.19倍的加速（平均1.85倍），且生成质量差异小于1%。

Conclusion: ASPD为高效LLM并行推理设定了新基准，适用于延迟敏感的应用场景。

Abstract: The increasing scale and complexity of large language models (LLMs) pose
significant inference latency challenges, primarily due to their autoregressive
decoding paradigm characterized by the sequential nature of next-token
prediction. By re-examining the outputs of autoregressive models, we observed
that some segments exhibit parallelizable structures, which we term intrinsic
parallelism. Decoding each parallelizable branch simultaneously (i.e. parallel
decoding) can significantly improve the overall inference speed of LLMs. In
this paper, we propose an Adaptive Serial-Parallel Decoding (ASPD), which
addresses two core challenges: automated construction of parallelizable data
and efficient parallel decoding mechanism. More specifically, we introduce a
non-invasive pipeline that automatically extracts and validates parallelizable
structures from the responses of autoregressive models. To empower efficient
adaptive serial-parallel decoding, we implement a Hybrid Decoding Engine which
enables seamless transitions between serial and parallel decoding modes while
maintaining a reusable KV cache, maximizing computational efficiency. Extensive
evaluations across General Tasks, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Mathematical
Reasoning, demonstrate that ASPD achieves unprecedented performance in both
effectiveness and efficiency. Notably, on Vicuna Bench, our method achieves up
to 3.19x speedup (1.85x on average) while maintaining response quality within
1% difference compared to autoregressive models, realizing significant
acceleration without compromising generation quality. Our framework sets a
groundbreaking benchmark for efficient LLM parallel inference, paving the way
for its deployment in latency-sensitive applications such as AI-powered
customer service bots and answer retrieval engines.

Conclusion: 弱监督与微调结合能有效克服数据稀缺问题，为低资源、多方言语言提供高质量的ASR解决方案。

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) plays a vital role in enabling natural
human-machine interaction across applications such as virtual assistants,
industrial automation, customer support, and real-time transcription. However,
developing accurate ASR systems for low-resource languages like Arabic remains
a significant challenge due to limited labeled data and the linguistic
complexity introduced by diverse dialects. In this work, we present a scalable
training pipeline that combines weakly supervised learning with supervised
fine-tuning to develop a robust Arabic ASR model. In the first stage, we
pretrain the model on 15,000 hours of weakly labeled speech covering both
Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and various Dialectal Arabic (DA) variants. In the
subsequent stage, we perform continual supervised fine-tuning using a mixture
of filtered weakly labeled data and a small, high-quality annotated dataset.
Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results, ranking first in the
multi-dialectal Arabic ASR challenge. These findings highlight the
effectiveness of weak supervision paired with fine-tuning in overcoming data
scarcity and delivering high-quality ASR for low-resource, dialect-rich
languages.

correct answers. Our results show that, in comparable settings, reasoning
context is beneficial for more challenging non-binary questions, but models

exploring how reasoning steps contribute to models' predictions, highlighting
different trends across models and languages.

Abstract: Recent work on enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models
(LLMs) has introduced explicit length control as a means of constraining
computational cost while preserving accuracy. However, existing approaches rely
on fixed-length training budgets, which do not take advantage of the natural
progression from exploration to compression during learning. In this work, we
propose a curriculum learning strategy for length-controlled reasoning using
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our method starts with generous
token budgets and gradually tightens them over training, encouraging models to
first discover effective solution strategies and then distill them into more
concise reasoning traces. We augment GRPO with a reward function that balances
three signals: task correctness (via verifier feedback), length efficiency, and
formatting adherence (via structural tags). Experiments on GSM8K, MATH500,
SVAMP, College Math, and GSM+ demonstrate that curriculum-based training
consistently outperforms fixed-budget baselines at the same final budget,
achieving higher accuracy and significantly improved token efficiency. We
further ablate the impact of reward weighting and decay schedule design,
showing that progressive constraint serves as a powerful inductive bias for
training efficient reasoning models. Our code and checkpoints are released at:

TL;DR: LoDIT是一种通过利用特定令牌逻辑在生成过程中联合生成并忠实归因答案的方法，显著提升了大型语言模型的信任度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）表现优异，但其幻觉问题严重影响了可信度。现有方法在直接对齐令牌生成与归因生成方面存在局限性。

Method: LoDIT通过两步实现：(1)用特定令牌标识标记文档，并利用这些令牌的逻辑估计文档对答案的贡献；(2)将这些贡献聚合为文档归因。

Result: 在Trust-Align基准测试中，LoDIT在多项指标上显著优于现有最先进模型，且具有低延迟和强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: LoDIT通过联合生成和归因，有效提升了LLMs的可信度，同时保持了高效和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Despite their impressive performances, Large Language Models (LLMs) remain
prone to hallucination, which critically undermines their trustworthiness.
While most of the previous work focused on tackling answer and attribution
correctness, a recent line of work investigated faithfulness, with a focus on
leveraging internal model signals to reflect a model's actual decision-making
process while generating the answer. Nevertheless, these methods induce
additional latency and have shown limitations in directly aligning token
generation with attribution generation. In this paper, we introduce LoDIT, a
method that jointly generates and faithfully attributes answers in RAG by
leveraging specific token logits during generation. It consists of two steps:
(1) marking the documents with specific token identifiers and then leveraging
the logits of these tokens to estimate the contribution of each document to the
answer during generation, and (2) aggregating these contributions into document
attributions. Experiments on a trustworthiness-focused attributed
text-generation benchmark, Trust-Align, show that LoDIT significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art models on several metrics. Finally, an in-depth
analysis of LoDIT shows both its efficiency in terms of latency and its
robustness in different settings.

*Seonghwan Choi,Beomseok Kang,Dongwon Jo,Jae-Joon Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RetroAttention是一种新型KV缓存更新技术，通过修正累积的注意力错误，提升长上下文任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长上下文任务中，KV缓存的内存占用和延迟问题限制了LLMs的性能，现有方法未能解决解码过程中的累积注意力错误。

Method: 提出RetroAttention技术，通过轻量级输出缓存修正过去的注意力输出，利用后续解码步骤的新KV条目。

Result: 在长生成基准测试中，RetroAttention显著优于现有方法，KV暴露提升1.6倍，准确率提升21.9%。

Conclusion: RetroAttention突破了固定注意力输出范式，为长上下文任务提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in long-context tasks
such as reasoning, code generation, and multi-turn dialogue. However, inference
over extended contexts is bottlenecked by the Key-Value (KV) cache, whose
memory footprint grows linearly with sequence length and dominates latency at
each decoding step. While recent KV cache compression methods identify and load
important tokens, they focus predominantly on input contexts and fail to
address the cumulative attention errors that arise during long decoding. In
this paper, we introduce RetroAttention, a novel KV cache update technique that
retrospectively revises past attention outputs using newly arrived KV entries
from subsequent decoding steps. By maintaining a lightweight output cache,
RetroAttention enables past queries to efficiently access more relevant
context, while incurring minimal latency overhead. This breaks the
fixed-attention-output paradigm and allows continual correction of prior
approximations. Extensive experiments on long-generation benchmarks show that
RetroAttention consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) KV compression
methods, increasing effective KV exposure by up to 1.6$\times$ and accuracy by
up to 21.9\%.

Result: 在测试阶段排名33/53，证明了零样本代码生成方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 零样本代码生成是表格问答任务的一种可行方法，无需任务特定微调。

Abstract: This paper describes our participation in SemEval 2025 Task 8, focused on
Tabular Question Answering. We developed a zero-shot pipeline that leverages an
Large Language Model to generate functional code capable of extracting the
relevant information from tabular data based on an input question. Our approach
consists of a modular pipeline where the main code generator module is
supported by additional components that identify the most relevant columns and
analyze their data types to improve extraction accuracy. In the event that the
generated code fails, an iterative refinement process is triggered,
incorporating the error feedback into a new generation prompt to enhance
robustness. Our results show that zero-shot code generation is a valid approach
for Tabular QA, achieving rank 33 of 53 in the test phase despite the lack of
task-specific fine-tuning.

TL;DR: 本文系统综述了无需训练的（TF）大语言模型（LLM）对齐方法，分为预解码、解码中和解码后三个阶段，并探讨了其机制与局限性，提出了未来研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对齐方法依赖资源密集的微调（FT），可能导致知识退化且适应性受限，而TF方法提供了一种更灵活的对齐方案。

Method: 通过分类预解码、解码中和解码后三个阶段，详细分析了TF方法的机制及其在LLM和多模态LLM（MLLM）中的应用。

Result: 总结了TF对齐方法的优势与局限性，并提出了未来发展的关键挑战和方向。

Conclusion: 本文为实践者提供了指导，并推动了更安全、可靠LLM的发展。

Abstract: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) aims to ensure their outputs
adhere to human values, ethical standards, and legal norms. Traditional
alignment methods often rely on resource-intensive fine-tuning (FT), which may
suffer from knowledge degradation and face challenges in scenarios where the
model accessibility or computational resources are constrained. In contrast,
training-free (TF) alignment techniques--leveraging in-context learning,
decoding-time adjustments, and post-generation corrections--offer a promising
alternative by enabling alignment without heavily retraining LLMs, making them
adaptable to both open-source and closed-source environments. This paper
presents the first systematic review of TF alignment methods, categorizing them
by stages of pre-decoding, in-decoding, and post-decoding. For each stage, we
provide a detailed examination from the viewpoint of LLMs and multimodal LLMs
(MLLMs), highlighting their mechanisms and limitations. Furthermore, we
identify key challenges and future directions, paving the way for more
inclusive and effective TF alignment techniques. By synthesizing and organizing
the rapidly growing body of research, this survey offers a guidance for
practitioners and advances the development of safer and more reliable LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在心理治疗中具有潜力，但其直接应用于患者场景存在伦理和安全问题，因此转向开发LLM作为监督者来培训治疗师。

Method: 建立错误行为指南和纠正策略，构建人机对话反馈数据集，通过微调生成监督模型用于治疗师培训。

Result: 实验表明，基于MATE数据集微调的模型能根据临床指南提供高质量反馈。

Conclusion: 该方法在治疗师培训场景中显示出显著潜力。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) hold significant promise in
psychotherapy, their direct application in patient-facing scenarios raises
ethical and safety concerns. Therefore, this work shifts towards developing an
LLM as a supervisor to train real therapists. In addition to the privacy of
clinical therapist training data, a fundamental contradiction complicates the
training of therapeutic behaviors: clear feedback standards are necessary to
ensure a controlled training system, yet there is no absolute "gold standard"
for appropriate therapeutic behaviors in practice. In contrast, many common
therapeutic mistakes are universal and identifiable, making them effective
triggers for targeted feedback that can serve as clearer evidence. Motivated by
this, we create a novel therapist-training paradigm: (1) guidelines for
mistaken behaviors and targeted correction strategies are first established as
standards; (2) a human-in-the-loop dialogue-feedback dataset is then
constructed, where a mistake-prone agent intentionally makes standard mistakes
during interviews naturally, and a supervisor agent locates and identifies
mistakes and provides targeted feedback; (3) after fine-tuning on this dataset,
the final supervisor model is provided for real therapist training. The
detailed experimental results of automated, human and downstream assessments
demonstrate that models fine-tuned on our dataset MATE, can provide
high-quality feedback according to the clinical guideline, showing significant
potential for the therapist training scenario.

Abstract: Given the significant advances in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) in
reasoning and visual understanding, mobile agents are rapidly emerging to meet
users' automation needs. However, existing evaluation benchmarks are
disconnected from the real world and fail to adequately address the diverse and
complex requirements of users. From our extensive collection of user
questionnaire, we identified five tasks: Multi-App, Vague, Interactive,
Single-App, and Unethical Instructions. Around these tasks, we present
\textbf{MVISU-Bench}, a bilingual benchmark that includes 404 tasks across 137
mobile applications. Furthermore, we propose Aider, a plug-and-play module that
acts as a dynamic prompt prompter to mitigate risks and clarify user intent for
mobile agents. Our Aider is easy to integrate into several frameworks and has
successfully improved overall success rates by 19.55\% compared to the current
state-of-the-art (SOTA) on MVISU-Bench. Specifically, it achieves success rate
improvements of 53.52\% and 29.41\% for unethical and interactive instructions,
respectively. Through extensive experiments and analysis, we highlight the gap
between existing mobile agents and real-world user expectations.

Motivation: 大型语言模型的推理过程因其自回归性质难以加速，影响高效部署，需要新的方法解决这一问题。

Method: READER利用自重复和统计搜索扩展推测解码树，优化KV缓存大小，适用于大批量场景。

Result: READER在无需额外训练的情况下，性能提升超过40%，在搜索任务中速度提升超过10倍。

Conclusion: READER是一种高效的无损推测解码方法，适用于工业应用，尤其在搜索任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) generate tokens autoregressively, with each
token depending on the preceding context. This sequential nature makes the
inference process inherently difficult to accelerate, posing a significant
challenge for efficient deployment. In recent years, various methods have been
proposed to address this issue, with the most effective approaches often
involving the training of additional draft models. In this paper, we introduce
READER (Retrieval-Assisted Drafter for Efficient LLM Inference), a novel
lossless speculative decoding method that enhances model-based approaches by
leveraging self-repetitions in the text. Our algorithm expands the speculative
decoding tree using tokens obtained through statistical search. This work
focuses on large batch sizes (>= 8), an underexplored yet important area for
industrial applications. We also analyze the key-value (KV) cache size during
speculative decoding and propose an optimization to improve performance for
large batches. As a result, READER outperforms existing speculative decoding
methods. Notably, READER requires no additional training and can reuse
pre-trained speculator models, increasing the speedup by over 40\%. Our method
demonstrates particularly strong performance on search-based tasks, such as
retrieval-augmented generation, where we achieve more than 10x speedup.

TL;DR: 论文提出Comparative Policy Optimization (CPO)方法，通过将奖励评估从单样本评分转向组间比较评分，解决了开放主观任务中的奖励模糊问题。CharacterArena框架进一步通过多轮角色扮演模拟和轨迹级比较评估，提升了对话质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统奖励建模在主观任务中面临主观评价标准和不稳定奖励信号的挑战，而人类评价结合了显式标准和隐式比较判断。

Method: 提出CPO方法，采用组间比较评分替代单样本评分；引入CharacterArena框架，包括多轮角色扮演模拟和轨迹级比较评估。

Result: 在CharacterEval、CharacterBench和CharacterArena上的实验表明，CPO有效减少奖励模糊性，显著提升对话质量。

Conclusion: CPO和CharacterArena通过比较评估范式，为开放主观任务提供了更稳健和公平的性能评估方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning (RLFT) has achieved notable success in
tasks with objectively verifiable answers (e.g., code generation, mathematical
reasoning), yet struggles with open-ended subjective tasks like role-playing
dialogue. Traditional reward modeling approaches, which rely on independent
sample-wise scoring, face dual challenges: subjective evaluation criteria and
unstable reward signals.Motivated by the insight that human evaluation
inherently combines explicit criteria with implicit comparative judgments, we
propose Comparative Policy Optimization (CPO). CPO redefines the reward
evaluation paradigm by shifting from sample-wise scoring to comparative
group-wise scoring.Building on the same principle, we introduce the
CharacterArena evaluation framework, which comprises two stages:(1)
Contextualized Multi-turn Role-playing Simulation, and (2) Trajectory-level
Comparative Evaluation. By operationalizing subjective scoring via objective
trajectory comparisons, CharacterArena minimizes contextual bias and enables
more robust and fair performance evaluation. Empirical results on
CharacterEval, CharacterBench, and CharacterArena confirm that CPO effectively
mitigates reward ambiguity and leads to substantial improvements in dialogue
quality.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新架构，通过融合所有中间层来提升低资源语言（LRLs）的性能，显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在英语上表现优异，但在低资源语言上性能下降，因训练以英语为中心。

Method: 采用两种策略：全局Softmax加权和Transformer Softmax模型，将融合表示映射到LLM的嵌入空间。

Result: 在多项任务中显著提升性能，如Sinhala分类准确率从71.66%提升至75.86%，XNLI平均准确率从70.36%提升至71.50%。

Conclusion: 该方法为提升多语言LLM能力提供了高效且可扩展的路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in English, but their performance degrades
significantly on low-resource languages (LRLs) due to English-centric training.
While methods like LangBridge align LLMs with multilingual encoders such as the
Massively Multilingual Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (mT5), they typically
use only the final encoder layer. We propose a novel architecture that fuses
all intermediate layers, enriching the linguistic information passed to the
LLM. Our approach features two strategies: (1) a Global Softmax weighting for
overall layer importance, and (2) a Transformer Softmax model that learns
token-specific weights. The fused representations are mapped into the LLM's
embedding space, enabling it to process multilingual inputs. The model is
trained only on English data, without using any parallel or multilingual data.
Evaluated on XNLI, IndicXNLI, Sinhala News Classification, and Amazon Reviews,
our Transformer Softmax model significantly outperforms the LangBridge
baseline. We observe strong performance gains in LRLs, improving Sinhala
classification accuracy from 71.66% to 75.86% and achieving clear improvements
across Indic languages such as Tamil, Bengali, and Malayalam. These specific
gains contribute to an overall boost in average XNLI accuracy from 70.36% to
71.50%. This approach offers a scalable, data-efficient path toward more
capable and equitable multilingual LLMs.

Motivation: 流程工业中事件日志的碎片化导致相关记录无法有效关联，阻碍了解决方案的推荐。研究旨在通过记录链接技术改善这一问题。

Method: 将记录链接问题建模为跨文档共指消解（CDCR）任务，结合NLI和STS，并引入因果推理（CI），以适应流程工业的文本格式。

Result: 提出的RL模型在性能上显著优于NLI和STS基线方法，分别提升了28%和27%。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过领域适配和增强推理能力，CDCR模型可以有效应用于流程工业，提升数据质量和日志关联性。

Abstract: Knowledge management (KM) is vital in the process industry for optimizing
operations, ensuring safety, and enabling continuous improvement through
effective use of operational data and past insights. A key challenge in this
domain is the fragmented nature of event logs in shift books, where related
records, e.g., entries documenting issues related to equipment or processes and
the corresponding solutions, may remain disconnected. This fragmentation
hinders the recommendation of previous solutions to the users. To address this
problem, we investigate record linking (RL) as link prediction, commonly
studied in graph-based machine learning, by framing it as a cross-document
coreference resolution (CDCR) task enhanced with natural language inference
(NLI) and semantic text similarity (STS) by shifting it into the causal
inference (CI). We adapt CDCR, traditionally applied in the news domain, into
an RL model to operate at the passage level, similar to NLI and STS, while
accommodating the process industry's specific text formats, which contain
unstructured text and structured record attributes. Our RL model outperformed
the best versions of NLI- and STS-driven baselines by 28% (11.43 points) and
27% (11.21 points), respectively. Our work demonstrates how domain adaptation
of the state-of-the-art CDCR models, enhanced with reasoning capabilities, can
be effectively tailored to the process industry, improving data quality and
connectivity in shift logs.

Motivation: 现有代码生成基准测试依赖人工标注且多集中于Python，难以扩展和覆盖多语言高难度任务。

Result: AutoCodeBench包含3,920个问题，覆盖20种语言，测试显示先进LLMs仍难以应对其复杂性和多样性。

Conclusion: AutoCodeBench系列为社区提供了评估多语言代码生成能力的重要资源，推动更挑战性任务的研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
various domains, with code generation emerging as a key area of focus. While
numerous benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate their code generation
abilities, these benchmarks face several critical limitations. First, they
often rely on manual annotations, which are time-consuming and difficult to
scale across different programming languages and problem complexities. Second,
most existing benchmarks focus primarily on Python, while the few multilingual
benchmarks suffer from limited difficulty and uneven language distribution. To
address these challenges, we propose AutoCodeGen, an automated method for
generating high-difficulty multilingual code generation datasets without manual
annotations. AutoCodeGen ensures the correctness and completeness of test cases
by generating test inputs with LLMs and obtaining test outputs through a
multilingual sandbox, while achieving high data quality through reverse-order
problem generation and multiple filtering steps. Using this novel method, we
introduce AutoCodeBench, a large-scale code generation benchmark comprising
3,920 problems evenly distributed across 20 programming languages. It is
specifically designed to evaluate LLMs on challenging, diverse, and practical
multilingual tasks. We evaluate over 30 leading open-source and proprietary
LLMs on AutoCodeBench and its simplified version AutoCodeBench-Lite. The
results show that even the most advanced LLMs struggle with the complexity,
diversity, and multilingual nature of these tasks. Besides, we introduce
AutoCodeBench-Complete, specifically designed for base models to assess their
few-shot code generation capabilities. We hope the AutoCodeBench series will
serve as a valuable resource and inspire the community to focus on more
challenging and practical multilingual code generation scenarios.

tokenizer with Sinhala specific vocabulary and perform continual pre-training
on a cleaned 10 million Sinhala corpus, resulting in the SinLlama model. This

Result: OdysseyBench能更准确地评估LLM代理在复杂场景中的能力，挑战现有先进模型。

Conclusion: OdysseyBench为LLM代理在现实生产力场景中的开发和评估提供了宝贵资源。

Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are increasingly
deployed in real-world applications requiring complex, long-horizon workflows.
However, existing benchmarks predominantly focus on atomic tasks that are
self-contained and independent, failing to capture the long-term contextual
dependencies and multi-interaction coordination required in realistic
scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce OdysseyBench, a comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating LLM agents on long-horizon workflows across diverse
office applications including Word, Excel, PDF, Email, and Calendar. Our
benchmark comprises two complementary splits: OdysseyBench+ with 300 tasks
derived from real-world use cases, and OdysseyBench-Neo with 302 newly
synthesized complex tasks. Each task requires agent to identify essential
information from long-horizon interaction histories and perform multi-step
reasoning across various applications. To enable scalable benchmark creation,
we propose HomerAgents, a multi-agent framework that automates the generation
of long-horizon workflow benchmarks through systematic environment exploration,
task generation, and dialogue synthesis. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates
that OdysseyBench effectively challenges state-of-the-art LLM agents, providing
more accurate assessment of their capabilities in complex, real-world contexts
compared to existing atomic task benchmarks. We believe that OdysseyBench will
serve as a valuable resource for advancing the development and evaluation of
LLM agents in real-world productivity scenarios. In addition, we release
OdysseyBench and HomerAgents to foster research along this line.

Motivation: 探索LLMs在逻辑丰富的指令上的表现，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 提出LogicIFGen框架，从代码函数生成可验证指令，并构建LogicIFEval基准。

Result: 实验显示，当前LLMs在LogicIFEval上表现不佳，正确率低于60%。

Conclusion: LLMs在复杂逻辑指令遵循能力上仍有显著不足，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Instruction following has catalyzed the recent era of Large Language Models
(LLMs) and is the foundational skill underpinning more advanced capabilities
such as reasoning and agentic behaviors. As tasks grow more challenging, the
logic structures embedded in natural language instructions becomes increasingly
intricate. However, how well LLMs perform on such logic-rich instructions
remains under-explored. We propose LogicIFGen and LogicIFEval. LogicIFGen is a
scalable, automated framework for generating verifiable instructions from code
functions, which can naturally express rich logic such as conditionals,
nesting, recursion, and function calls. We further curate a collection of
complex code functions and use LogicIFGen to construct LogicIFEval, a benchmark

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文揭示了扩散大语言模型（dLLMs）在生成文本时存在的时间振荡现象，并提出两种利用时间一致性的方法，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前解码策略忽略了中间预测的丰富信息，而时间振荡现象表明正确结果可能在中间步骤出现但被后续步骤覆盖，因此需要利用时间一致性改进解码。

Method: 1) 训练无关的解码策略Temporal Self-Consistency Voting，聚合多步预测选择最一致输出；2) 训练后方法Temporal Consistency Reinforcement，使用TSE作为奖励信号鼓励稳定生成。

Result: 实验表明，仅使用负TSE奖励即可在Countdown数据集上提升24.7%，结合准确率奖励在多个数据集上取得显著提升（如GSM8K提升2.0%）。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了dLLMs中时间动态的潜力，并提供了两种简单有效的工具来利用这些动态。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) generate text through iterative
denoising, yet current decoding strategies discard rich intermediate
predictions in favor of the final output. Our work here reveals a critical
phenomenon, temporal oscillation, where correct answers often emerge in the
middle process, but are overwritten in later denoising steps. To address this
issue, we introduce two complementary methods that exploit temporal
consistency: 1) Temporal Self-Consistency Voting, a training-free, test-time
decoding strategy that aggregates predictions across denoising steps to select
the most consistent output; and 2) a post-training method termed Temporal
Consistency Reinforcement, which uses Temporal Semantic Entropy (TSE), a
measure of semantic stability across intermediate predictions, as a reward
signal to encourage stable generations. Empirical results across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Using the negative
TSE reward alone, we observe a remarkable average improvement of 24.7% on the
Countdown dataset over an existing dLLM. Combined with the accuracy reward, we
achieve absolute gains of 2.0% on GSM8K, 4.3% on MATH500, 6.6% on SVAMP, and
25.3% on Countdown, respectively. Our findings underscore the untapped
potential of temporal dynamics in dLLMs and offer two simple yet effective
tools to harness them.

TL;DR: ImageDDI提出了一种结合分子图像信息的框架，通过全局和局部结构表示药物对，显著提升了药物相互作用（DDI）预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在药物相互作用预测中受限于基于功能基序的表征学习，而DDI本质上是基序相互作用。因此，需要一种结合全局和局部结构的方法。

Method: ImageDDI将分子分解为功能基序，通过基于Transformer的编码器嵌入序列，并结合分子图像信息（如纹理、颜色等）增强空间表征。

Result: 在广泛使用的数据集上，ImageDDI优于现有方法，并在2D和3D图像增强场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: ImageDDI通过结合分子图像信息和功能基序序列，显著提升了DDI预测的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: To mitigate the potential adverse health effects of simultaneous multi-drug
use, including unexpected side effects and interactions, accurately identifying
and predicting drug-drug interactions (DDIs) is considered a crucial task in
the field of deep learning. Although existing methods have demonstrated
promising performance, they suffer from the bottleneck of limited functional
motif-based representation learning, as DDIs are fundamentally caused by motif
interactions rather than the overall drug structures. In this paper, we propose
an Image-enhanced molecular motif sequence representation framework for
\textbf{DDI} prediction, called ImageDDI, which represents a pair of drugs from
both global and local structures. Specifically, ImageDDI tokenizes molecules
into functional motifs. To effectively represent a drug pair, their motifs are
combined into a single sequence and embedded using a transformer-based encoder,
starting from the local structure representation. By leveraging the
associations between drug pairs, ImageDDI further enhances the spatial
representation of molecules using global molecular image information (e.g.
texture, shadow, color, and planar spatial relationships). To integrate
molecular visual information into functional motif sequence, ImageDDI employs
Adaptive Feature Fusion, enhancing the generalization of ImageDDI by
dynamically adapting the fusion process of feature representations.
Experimental results on widely used datasets demonstrate that ImageDDI
outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, extensive experiments show that
ImageDDI achieved competitive performance in both 2D and 3D image-enhanced
scenarios compared to other models.

Motivation: 现有方法难以同时满足水印的不可见性、鲁棒性和广泛适用性，HiWL旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 两阶段优化：第一阶段通过分布对齐学习建立共同潜在空间，第二阶段通过广义水印表示学习分离水印与图像内容。

Result: 实验表明，HiWL的水印提取准确率比现有方法高7.6%，且处理速度快（8秒处理10万张图像）。

Conclusion: HiWL在满足水印三大标准的同时，显著提升了性能，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Deep image watermarking, which refers to enable imperceptible watermark
embedding and reliable extraction in cover images, has shown to be effective
for copyright protection of image assets. However, existing methods face
limitations in simultaneously satisfying three essential criteria for
generalizable watermarking: 1) invisibility (imperceptible hide of watermarks),
2) robustness (reliable watermark recovery under diverse conditions), and 3)
broad applicability (low latency in watermarking process). To address these
limitations, we propose a Hierarchical Watermark Learning (HiWL), a two-stage
optimization that enable a watermarking model to simultaneously achieve three
criteria. In the first stage, distribution alignment learning is designed to
establish a common latent space with two constraints: 1) visual consistency
between watermarked and non-watermarked images, and 2) information invariance
across watermark latent representations. In this way, multi-modal inputs
including watermark message (binary codes) and cover images (RGB pixels) can be
well represented, ensuring the invisibility of watermarks and robustness in
watermarking process thereby. The second stage employs generalized watermark
representation learning to establish a disentanglement policy for separating
watermarks from image content in RGB space. In particular, it strongly
penalizes substantial fluctuations in separated RGB watermarks corresponding to
identical messages. Consequently, HiWL effectively learns generalizable
latent-space watermark representations while maintaining broad applicability.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed method. In
particular, it achieves 7.6\% higher accuracy in watermark extraction than
existing methods, while maintaining extremely low latency (100K images
processed in 8s).

Abstract: Object detection (OD) has become vital for numerous computer vision
applications, but deploying it on resource-constrained IoT devices presents a
significant challenge. These devices, often powered by energy-efficient
microcontrollers, struggle to handle the computational load of deep
learning-based OD models. This issue is compounded by the rapid proliferation
of IoT devices, predicted to surpass 150 billion by 2030. TinyML offers a
compelling solution by enabling OD on ultra-low-power devices, paving the way
for efficient and real-time processing at the edge. Although numerous survey
papers have been published on this topic, they often overlook the optimization
challenges associated with deploying OD models in TinyML environments. To
address this gap, this survey paper provides a detailed analysis of key
optimization techniques for deploying OD models on resource-constrained
devices. These techniques include quantization, pruning, knowledge
distillation, and neural architecture search. Furthermore, we explore both
theoretical approaches and practical implementations, bridging the gap between
academic research and real-world edge artificial intelligence deployment.
Finally, we compare the key performance indicators (KPIs) of existing OD
implementations on microcontroller devices, highlighting the achieved maturity
level of these solutions in terms of both prediction accuracy and efficiency.
We also provide a public repository to continually track developments in this
fast-evolving field:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAViS是一个多智能体协作框架，用于生成长序列视频，解决了现有框架在辅助能力、视觉质量和表现力方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长序列视频生成框架在辅助能力、视觉质量和表现力方面存在显著限制，MAViS旨在解决这些问题。

Method: MAViS通过多阶段协作（如脚本编写、镜头设计等），采用3E原则（探索、检查、增强）优化中间输出，并提出脚本编写指南以适配生成工具。

Result: 实验表明，MAViS在辅助能力、视觉质量和表现力方面达到最优，并能生成高质量的多模态视频（带叙事和背景音乐）。

Conclusion: MAViS是目前唯一支持多模态设计输出的框架，显著提升了用户创作灵感和创造力。

Abstract: Despite recent advances, long-sequence video generation frameworks still
suffer from significant limitations: poor assistive capability, suboptimal
visual quality, and limited expressiveness. To mitigate these limitations, we
propose MAViS, an end-to-end multi-agent collaborative framework for
long-sequence video storytelling. MAViS orchestrates specialized agents across
multiple stages, including script writing, shot designing, character modeling,
keyframe generation, video animation, and audio generation. In each stage,
agents operate under the 3E Principle -- Explore, Examine, and Enhance -- to
ensure the completeness of intermediate outputs. Considering the capability
limitations of current generative models, we propose the Script Writing
Guidelines to optimize compatibility between scripts and generative tools.
Experimental results demonstrate that MAViS achieves state-of-the-art
performance in assistive capability, visual quality, and video expressiveness.
Its modular framework further enables scalability with diverse generative
models and tools. With just a brief user prompt, MAViS is capable of producing
high-quality, expressive long-sequence video storytelling, enriching
inspirations and creativity for users. To the best of our knowledge, MAViS is
the only framework that provides multimodal design output -- videos with
narratives and background music.

TL;DR: 提出了一种任务无关和硬件无关的流程，通过NTKD方法提升混合光学神经网络的性能，解决了训练精度差距和模拟与硬件实现差异的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混合光学神经网络（ONNs）在实时、功耗受限系统中具有能效优势，但受限于训练精度差距和模拟与硬件实现的差异，限制了其应用。

Method: 提出任务无关和硬件无关的流程，包括预训练阶段的模型精度估计和训练阶段的NTKD方法，以对齐光学模型与电子教师网络。

Result: 在多个数据集和硬件配置上的实验表明，该流程显著提升了ONN性能，支持实际部署。

Conclusion: 该流程为混合光学神经网络的广泛应用提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Hybrid Optical Neural Networks (ONNs, typically consisting of an optical
frontend and a digital backend) offer an energy-efficient alternative to fully
digital deep networks for real-time, power-constrained systems. However, their
adoption is limited by two main challenges: the accuracy gap compared to
large-scale networks during training, and discrepancies between simulated and
fabricated systems that further degrade accuracy. While previous work has
proposed end-to-end optimizations for specific datasets (e.g., MNIST) and
optical systems, these approaches typically lack generalization across tasks
and hardware designs. To address these limitations, we propose a task-agnostic
and hardware-agnostic pipeline that supports image classification and
segmentation across diverse optical systems. To assist optical system design
before training, we estimate achievable model accuracy based on user-specified
constraints such as physical size and the dataset. For training, we introduce
Neural Tangent Knowledge Distillation (NTKD), which aligns optical models with
electronic teacher networks, thereby narrowing the accuracy gap. After
fabrication, NTKD also guides fine-tuning of the digital backend to compensate
for implementation errors. Experiments on multiple datasets (e.g., MNIST,
CIFAR, Carvana Masking) and hardware configurations show that our pipeline
consistently improves ONN performance and enables practical deployment in both
pre-fabrication simulations and physical implementations.

TL;DR: MuGa-VTON是一个统一的多服装扩散框架，通过联合建模上下服装和个人身份，提升了虚拟试穿的逼真度和灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常分开处理上下服装，预处理复杂，且难以保留个人特征（如纹身、配饰和体型），限制了实用性和真实感。

Method: 提出三个关键模块：服装表示模块（GRM）、个人表示模块（PRM）和A-DiT融合模块，通过扩散变压器整合服装、个人和文本提示特征。

Result: 在VITON-HD和DressCode基准测试中表现优异，生成高保真且保留身份的结果。

Conclusion: MuGa-VTON适用于现实世界的虚拟试穿应用，支持基于提示的细粒度定制。

Abstract: Virtual try-on seeks to generate photorealistic images of individuals in
desired garments, a task that must simultaneously preserve personal identity
and garment fidelity for practical use in fashion retail and personalization.
However, existing methods typically handle upper and lower garments separately,
rely on heavy preprocessing, and often fail to preserve person-specific cues
such as tattoos, accessories, and body shape-resulting in limited realism and
flexibility. To this end, we introduce MuGa-VTON, a unified multi-garment
diffusion framework that jointly models upper and lower garments together with
person identity in a shared latent space. Specifically, we proposed three key
modules: the Garment Representation Module (GRM) for capturing both garment
semantics, the Person Representation Module (PRM) for encoding identity and
pose cues, and the A-DiT fusion module, which integrates garment, person, and
text-prompt features through a diffusion transformer. This architecture
supports prompt-based customization, allowing fine-grained garment
modifications with minimal user input. Extensive experiments on the VITON-HD
and DressCode benchmarks demonstrate that MuGa-VTON outperforms existing
methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, producing
high-fidelity, identity-preserving results suitable for real-world virtual
try-on applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CObL的扩散架构，用于从图像中推断出遮挡有序的对象层堆叠表示，能够零样本泛化到真实世界场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉任务需要将像素分组为对象并理解其空间关系，包括遮挡和深度。

Method: 使用基于扩散的架构CObL，利用Stable Diffusion作为先验，通过并行生成对象层并确保其复合回输入图像。

Result: CObL在合成图像上训练后，能够零样本泛化到真实世界场景，无需用户提示或预先知道对象数量。

Conclusion: CObL在无监督对象表示学习中表现出色，突破了训练环境的限制。

Abstract: Vision benefits from grouping pixels into objects and understanding their
spatial relationships, both laterally and in depth. We capture this with a
scene representation comprising an occlusion-ordered stack of "object layers,"
each containing an isolated and amodally-completed object. To infer this
representation from an image, we introduce a diffusion-based architecture named
Concurrent Object Layers (CObL). CObL generates a stack of object layers in
parallel, using Stable Diffusion as a prior for natural objects and
inference-time guidance to ensure the inferred layers composite back to the
input image. We train CObL using a few thousand synthetically-generated images
of multi-object tabletop scenes, and we find that it zero-shot generalizes to
photographs of real-world tabletops with varying numbers of novel objects. In
contrast to recent models for amodal object completion, CObL reconstructs
multiple occluded objects without user prompting and without knowing the number
of objects beforehand. Unlike previous models for unsupervised object-centric
representation learning, CObL is not limited to the world it was trained in.

Method: 提出一种结合多模态标注、跨模态嵌入分析和检索增强评估的框架，应用于《Re:Zero》漫画的308个标注面板，评估生成叙事、上下文对话基础和时序推理能力。

Result: 当前模型缺乏真正的故事级智能，尤其在非线性叙事、角色一致性和长序列因果推理方面表现不佳。

Conclusion: 该研究为评估叙事智能提供了基础和方法论，并揭示了VLMs在深层序列视觉叙事理解中的局限性。

Abstract: Current Vision Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate a critical gap between
surface-level recognition and deep narrative reasoning when processing
sequential visual storytelling. Through a comprehensive investigation of manga
narrative understanding, we reveal that while recent large multimodal models
excel at individual panel interpretation, they systematically fail at temporal
causality and cross-panel cohesion, core requirements for coherent story
comprehension. We introduce a novel evaluation framework that combines
fine-grained multimodal annotation, cross-modal embedding analysis, and
retrieval-augmented assessment to systematically characterize these
limitations.
  Our methodology includes (i) a rigorous annotation protocol linking visual
elements to narrative structure through aligned light novel text, (ii)
comprehensive evaluation across multiple reasoning paradigms, including direct
inference and retrieval-augmented generation, and (iii) cross-modal similarity
analysis revealing fundamental misalignments in current VLMs' joint
representations. Applying this framework to Re:Zero manga across 11 chapters
with 308 annotated panels, we conduct the first systematic study of long-form
narrative understanding in VLMs through three core evaluation axes: generative
storytelling, contextual dialogue grounding, and temporal reasoning. Our
findings demonstrate that current models lack genuine story-level intelligence,
struggling particularly with non-linear narratives, character consistency, and
causal inference across extended sequences. This work establishes both the
foundation and practical methodology for evaluating narrative intelligence,
while providing actionable insights into the capability of deep sequential
understanding of Discrete Visual Narratives beyond basic recognition in
Multimodal Models.

TL;DR: VISOR是一种通过优化视觉输入实现行为控制的新方法，无需侵入模型内部，适用于所有VLM服务模式，且在安全性和隐蔽性上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有行为控制方法（如系统提示）易检测且效果有限，而基于激活的转向向量需要侵入模型内部，不适用于API服务和闭源部署。VISOR旨在解决这些问题。

Method: VISOR通过设计通用的转向图像，诱导目标激活模式，实现行为控制。验证实验在LLaVA-1.5-7B上进行，涵盖拒绝、谄媚和生存本能三个任务。

Result: VISOR在行为控制任务中表现优异，单张150KB图像即可接近转向向量的性能（1-2%差距），并在负面转向任务中显著超越（高达25%的基线偏移）。同时，不影响其他任务的性能（99.9% MMLU任务表现）。

Conclusion: VISOR为多模态模型控制提供了新思路，同时揭示了视觉转向攻击的安全漏洞，呼吁开发针对此类攻击的防御措施。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly being used in a broad range of
applications, bringing their security and behavioral control to the forefront.
While existing approaches for behavioral control or output redirection, like
system prompting in VLMs, are easily detectable and often ineffective,
activation-based steering vectors require invasive runtime access to model
internals--incompatible with API-based services and closed-source deployments.
We introduce VISOR (Visual Input-based Steering for Output Redirection), a
novel method that achieves sophisticated behavioral control through optimized
visual inputs alone. By crafting universal steering images that induce target
activation patterns, VISOR enables practical deployment across all VLM serving
modalities while remaining imperceptible compared to explicit textual
instructions. We validate VISOR on LLaVA-1.5-7B across three critical alignment
tasks: refusal, sycophancy and survival instinct. A single 150KB steering image
matches steering vector performance within 1-2% for positive behavioral shifts
while dramatically exceeding it for negative steering--achieving up to 25%
shifts from baseline compared to steering vectors' modest changes. Unlike
system prompting (3-4% shifts), VISOR provides robust bidirectional control
while maintaining 99.9% performance on 14,000 unrelated MMLU tasks. Beyond
eliminating runtime overhead and model access requirements, VISOR exposes a
critical security vulnerability: adversaries can achieve sophisticated
behavioral manipulation through visual channels alone, bypassing text-based
defenses. Our work fundamentally re-imagines multimodal model control and
highlights the urgent need for defenses against visual steering attacks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近代日本文献转录任务耗时且标注数据稀缺，限制了OCR系统的训练。

Method: 提出基于距离的目标函数（欧氏距离和MMD），减少平行图像对的自注意力特征差异。

Result: 实验显示，该方法将字符错误率分别降低2.23%（欧氏距离）和3.94%（MMD）。

Conclusion: 该方法提升了自注意力表示质量，显著改善了历史文献OCR性能。

Abstract: Kindai documents, written in modern Japanese from the late 19th to early 20th
century, hold significant historical value for researchers studying societal
structures, daily life, and environmental conditions of that period. However,
transcribing these documents remains a labor-intensive and time-consuming task,
resulting in limited annotated data for training optical character recognition
(OCR) systems. This research addresses this challenge of data scarcity by
leveraging parallel textline images - pairs of original Kindai text and their
counterparts in contemporary Japanese fonts - to augment training datasets. We
introduce a distance-based objective function that minimizes the gap between
self-attention features of the parallel image pairs. Specifically, we explore
Euclidean distance and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) as domain adaptation
metrics. Experimental results demonstrate that our method reduces the character
error rate (CER) by 2.23% and 3.94% over a Transformer-based OCR baseline when
using Euclidean distance and MMD, respectively. Furthermore, our approach
improves the discriminative quality of self-attention representations, leading
to more effective OCR performance for historical documents.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CalAttn的新方法，通过学习每个实例的自适应温度来改进Vision Transformers的概率校准，显著降低了校准误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在风险敏感的应用中，Vision Transformers的概率校准至关重要。传统的温度缩放方法使用单一全局标量，需要额外的验证集，存在局限性。

Method: 提出了Calibration Attention (CalAttn)，一个即插即用的模块，直接从ViT的CLS标记中学习每个实例的自适应温度。

Result: 在多个数据集上，CalAttn将校准误差降低了高达4倍，同时仅增加不到0.1%的参数。学习到的温度值集中在1.0附近，优于传统方法。

Conclusion: CalAttn简单高效，适用于多种架构，在不牺牲准确性的情况下提供了更可信的概率输出。

Abstract: Probability calibration is critical when Vision Transformers are deployed in
risk-sensitive applications. The standard fix, post-hoc temperature scaling,
uses a single global scalar and requires a held-out validation set. We
introduce Calibration Attention (CalAttn), a drop-in module that learns an
adaptive, per-instance temperature directly from the ViT's CLS token. Across
CIFAR-10/100, MNIST, Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet-1K, CalAttn reduces
calibration error by up to 4x on ViT-224, DeiT, and Swin, while adding under
0.1 percent additional parameters. The learned temperatures cluster tightly
around 1.0, in contrast to the large global values used by standard temperature
scaling. CalAttn is simple, efficient, and architecture-agnostic, and yields
more trustworthy probabilities without sacrificing accuracy. Code:

Abstract: Both limited annotation and domain shift are significant challenges
frequently encountered in medical image segmentation, leading to derivative
scenarios like semi-supervised medical (SSMIS), semi-supervised medical domain
generalization (Semi-MDG) and unsupervised medical domain adaptation (UMDA).
Conventional methods are generally tailored to specific tasks in isolation, the
error accumulation hinders the effective utilization of unlabeled data and
limits further improvements, resulting in suboptimal performance when these
issues occur. In this paper, we aim to develop a generic framework that masters
all three tasks. We found that the key to solving the problem lies in how to
generate reliable pseudo labels for the unlabeled data in the presence of
domain shift with labeled data and increasing the diversity of the model. To
tackle this issue, we employ a Diverse Teaching and Label Propagation Network
(DTLP-Net) to boosting the Generic Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation.
Our DTLP-Net involves a single student model and two diverse teacher models,
which can generate reliable pseudo-labels for the student model. The first
teacher model decouple the training process with labeled and unlabeled data,
The second teacher is momentum-updated periodically, thus generating reliable
yet divers pseudo-labels. To fully utilize the information within the data, we
adopt inter-sample and intra-sample data augmentation to learn the global and
local knowledge. In addition, to further capture the voxel-level correlations,
we propose label propagation to enhance the model robust. We evaluate our
proposed framework on five benchmark datasets for SSMIS, UMDA, and Semi-MDG
tasks. The results showcase notable improvements compared to state-of-the-art
methods across all five settings, indicating the potential of our framework to
tackle more challenging SSL scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散先验在盲人脸恢复中存在适应性问题，主要源于高质量与低质量图像、合成与真实图像之间的差距。

Method: FLIPNET通过两种模式工作：恢复模式逐步整合BFR特征和面部嵌入；退化模式基于真实退化数据集合成类似真实退化的图像。

Result: 模型在基准数据集上表现优于现有基于扩散先验的BFR方法，且在模拟真实退化方面优于朴素退化模型。

Conclusion: FLIPNET有效解决了扩散先验在BFR中的适应性问题，提升了恢复的真实性和退化建模能力。

Abstract: Although diffusion prior is rising as a powerful solution for blind face
restoration (BFR), the inherent gap between the vanilla diffusion model and BFR
settings hinders its seamless adaptation. The gap mainly stems from the
discrepancy between 1) high-quality (HQ) and low-quality (LQ) images and 2)
synthesized and real-world images. The vanilla diffusion model is trained on
images with no or less degradations, whereas BFR handles moderately to severely
degraded images. Additionally, LQ images used for training are synthesized by a
naive degradation model with limited degradation patterns, which fails to
simulate complex and unknown degradations in real-world scenarios. In this
work, we use a unified network FLIPNET that switches between two modes to
resolve specific gaps. In Restoration mode, the model gradually integrates
BFR-oriented features and face embeddings from LQ images to achieve authentic
and faithful face restoration. In Degradation mode, the model synthesizes
real-world like degraded images based on the knowledge learned from real-world
degradation datasets. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets show that our
model 1) outperforms previous diffusion prior based BFR methods in terms of
authenticity and fidelity, and 2) outperforms the naive degradation model in
modeling the real-world degradations.

Result: 实验证明AutoSAME在LV分割、关键点定位和指标测量中表现优异。

Abstract: Left ventricular (LV) indicator measurements following clinical
echocardiog-raphy guidelines are important for diagnosing cardiovascular
disease. Alt-hough existing algorithms have explored automated LV
quantification, they can struggle to capture generic visual representations due
to the normally small training datasets. Therefore, it is necessary to
introduce vision founda-tional models (VFM) with abundant knowledge. However,
VFMs represented by the segment anything model (SAM) are usually suitable for
segmentation but incapable of identifying key anatomical points, which are
critical in LV indicator measurements. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework named AutoSAME, combining the powerful visual understanding of SAM
with seg-mentation and landmark localization tasks simultaneously.
Consequently, the framework mimics the operation of cardiac sonographers,
achieving LV indi-cator measurements consistent with clinical guidelines. We
further present fil-tered cross-branch attention (FCBA) in AutoSAME, which
leverages relatively comprehensive features in the segmentation to enhance the
heatmap regression (HR) of key points from the frequency domain perspective,
optimizing the vis-ual representation learned by the latter. Moreover, we
propose spatial-guided prompt alignment (SGPA) to automatically generate prompt
embeddings guid-ed by spatial properties of LV, thereby improving the accuracy
of dense pre-dictions by prior spatial knowledge. The extensive experiments on
an echocar-diography dataset demonstrate the efficiency of each design and the
superiori-ty of our AutoSAME in LV segmentation, landmark localization, and
indicator measurements. The code will be available at

Result: 在多种数据集上显著优于基线，定量和定性指标均有提升。

Conclusion: 该方法在无需标注的情况下，有效提升了复杂虚假相关性下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: To enhance group robustness to spurious correlations, prior work often relies
on auxiliary annotations for groups or spurious features and assumes identical
sets of groups across source and target domains. These two requirements are
both unnatural and impractical in real-world settings. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a method that leverages the semantic structure inherent
in class labels--specifically, superclass information--to naturally reduce
reliance on spurious features. Our model employs gradient-based attention
guided by a pre-trained vision-language model to disentangle
superclass-relevant and irrelevant features. Then, by promoting the use of all
superclass-relevant features for prediction, our approach achieves robustness
to more complex spurious correlations without the need to annotate any source
samples. Experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms baselines in domain generalization tasks, with clear
improvements in both quantitative metrics and qualitative visualizations.

Abstract: Generating human videos with realistic and controllable motions is a
challenging task. While existing methods can generate visually compelling
videos, they lack separate control over four key video elements: foreground
subject, background video, human trajectory and action patterns. In this paper,
we propose a decomposed human motion control and video generation framework
that explicitly decouples motion from appearance, subject from background, and
action from trajectory, enabling flexible mix-and-match composition of these
elements. Concretely, we first build a ground-aware 3D world coordinate system
and perform motion editing directly in the 3D space. Trajectory control is
implemented by unprojecting edited 2D trajectories into 3D with focal-length
calibration and coordinate transformation, followed by speed alignment and
orientation adjustment; actions are supplied by a motion bank or generated via
text-to-motion methods. Then, based on modern text-to-video diffusion
transformer models, we inject the subject as tokens for full attention,
concatenate the background along the channel dimension, and add motion
(trajectory and action) control signals by addition. Such a design opens up the
possibility for us to generate realistic videos of anyone doing anything
anywhere. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and real-world cases
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
element-wise controllability and overall video quality.

Result: 实验表明，DocThinker显著提高了泛化能力，并生成更可解释的推理步骤。

Conclusion: 强化学习是增强多模态大语言模型文档理解可解释性和适应性的有效方法。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in document understanding. However, their reasoning processes
remain largely black-box, making it difficult to ensure reliability and
trustworthiness, especially in high-stakes domains such as legal, financial,
and medical document analysis. Existing methods use fixed Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) reasoning with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) but suffer from catastrophic
forgetting, poor adaptability, and limited generalization across domain tasks.
In this paper, we propose DocThinker, a rule-based Reinforcement Learning (RL)
framework for dynamic inference-time reasoning. Instead of relying on static
CoT templates, DocThinker autonomously refines reasoning strategies via policy
learning, generating explainable intermediate results, including structured
reasoning processes, rephrased questions, regions of interest (RoI) supporting
the answer, and the final answer. By integrating multi-objective rule-based
rewards and KL-constrained optimization, our method mitigates catastrophic
forgetting and enhances both adaptability and transparency. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that DocThinker significantly
improves generalization while producing more explainable and
human-understandable reasoning steps. Our findings highlight RL as a powerful
alternative for enhancing explainability and adaptability in MLLM-based
document understanding. Code will be available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DETR-based方法在HOI检测中因随机初始化查询缺乏语义导致性能不佳。

Method: 提出QueryCraft框架，结合ACTOR（跨模态Transformer）和PDQD（感知蒸馏查询解码器）生成语义化查询。

Result: 在HICO-Det和V-COCO基准测试中达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: QueryCraft通过语义化查询初始化显著提升HOI检测性能。

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection aims to localize human-object pairs
and recognize their interactions in images. Although DETR-based methods have
recently emerged as the mainstream framework for HOI detection, they still
suffer from a key limitation: Randomly initialized queries lack explicit
semantics, leading to suboptimal detection performance. To address this
challenge, we propose QueryCraft, a novel plug-and-play HOI detection framework
that incorporates semantic priors and guided feature learning through
transformer-based query initialization. Central to our approach is
\textbf{ACTOR} (\textbf{A}ction-aware \textbf{C}ross-modal
\textbf{T}ransf\textbf{OR}mer), a cross-modal Transformer encoder that jointly
attends to visual regions and textual prompts to extract action-relevant
features. Rather than merely aligning modalities, ACTOR leverages
language-guided attention to infer interaction semantics and produce
semantically meaningful query representations. To further enhance object-level
query quality, we introduce a \textbf{P}erceptual \textbf{D}istilled
\textbf{Q}uery \textbf{D}ecoder (\textbf{PDQD}), which distills object category
awareness from a pre-trained detector to serve as object query initiation. This
dual-branch query initialization enables the model to generate more
interpretable and effective queries for HOI detection. Extensive experiments on
HICO-Det and V-COCO benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance and strong generalization. Code will be released
upon publication.

Abstract: We present Yan, a foundational framework for interactive video generation,

Specifically, Yan comprises three core modules. AAA-level Simulation: We design
a highly-compressed, low-latency 3D-VAE coupled with a KV-cache-based
shift-window denoising inference process, achieving real-time 1080P/60FPS
interactive simulation. Multi-Modal Generation: We introduce a hierarchical
autoregressive caption method that injects game-specific knowledge into
open-domain multi-modal video diffusion models (VDMs), then transforming the
VDM into a frame-wise, action-controllable, real-time infinite interactive
video generator. Notably, when the textual and visual prompts are sourced from
different domains, the model demonstrates strong generalization, allowing it to
blend and compose the style and mechanics across domains flexibly according to
user prompts. Multi-Granularity Editing: We propose a hybrid model that
explicitly disentangles interactive mechanics simulation from visual rendering,
enabling multi-granularity video content editing during interaction through
text. Collectively, Yan offers an integration of these modules, pushing
interactive video generation beyond isolated capabilities toward a
comprehensive AI-driven interactive creation paradigm, paving the way for the

Result: TransMiter在视觉识别任务中有效且高效地迁移适应知识，同时保持泛化能力。

Conclusion: TransMiter是一种低成本、高效的适配器，适用于不同规模和架构的视觉语言模型。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been widely used in various visual
recognition tasks due to their remarkable generalization capabilities. As these
models grow in size and complexity, fine-tuning becomes costly, emphasizing the
need to reuse adaptation knowledge from 'weaker' models to efficiently enhance
'stronger' ones. However, existing adaptation transfer methods exhibit limited
transferability across models due to their model-specific design and high
computational demands. To tackle this, we propose Transferable Model-agnostic
adapter (TransMiter), a light-weight adapter that improves vision-language
models 'without backpropagation'. TransMiter captures the knowledge gap between
pre-trained and fine-tuned VLMs, in an 'unsupervised' manner. Once trained,
this knowledge can be seamlessly transferred across different models without
the need for backpropagation. Moreover, TransMiter consists of only a few
layers, inducing a negligible additional inference cost. Notably, supplementing
the process with a few labeled data further yields additional performance gain,
often surpassing a fine-tuned stronger model, with a marginal training cost.
Experimental results and analyses demonstrate that TransMiter effectively and
efficiently transfers adaptation knowledge while preserving generalization
abilities across VLMs of different sizes and architectures in visual
recognition tasks.

Abstract: Shooting video with a handheld mobile phone, the most common photographic
device, often results in blurry frames due to shaking hands and other
instability factors. Although previous video deblurring methods have achieved
impressive progress, they still struggle to perform satisfactorily on
real-world handheld video due to the blur domain gap between training and
testing data. To address the issue, we propose a self-supervised method for
handheld video deblurring, which is driven by sharp clues in the video. First,
to train the deblurring model, we extract the sharp clues from the video and
take them as misalignment labels of neighboring blurry frames. Second, to
improve the model's ability, we propose a novel Self-Enhanced Video Deblurring
(SEVD) method to create higher-quality paired video data. Third, we propose a
Self-Constrained Spatial Consistency Maintenance (SCSCM) method to regularize
the model, preventing position shifts between the output and input frames.
Moreover, we construct a synthetic and a real-world handheld video dataset for
handheld video deblurring. Extensive experiments on these two and other common
real-world datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
existing self-supervised ones. The code and datasets are publicly available at

Abstract: Neural artistic style transfers and blends the content and style
representation of one image with the style of another. This enables artists to
create unique innovative visuals and enhances artistic expression in various
fields including art, design, and film. Color transfer algorithms are an
important in digital image processing by adjusting the color information in a
target image based on the colors in the source image. Color transfer enhances
images and videos in film and photography, and can aid in image correction. We
introduce a methodology that combines neural artistic style with color
transfer. The method uses the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to
quantitatively evaluate color and luminance histogram matching algorithms
including Reinhard global color transfer, iteration distribution transfer
(IDT), IDT with regrain, Cholesky, and PCA between the original and neural
artistic style transferred image using deep learning. We estimate the color
channel kernel densities. Various experiments are performed to evaluate the KL
of these algorithms and their color histograms for style to content transfer.

Conclusion: HVPL模型有效解决了VIS中的持续学习问题，代码已开源。

Abstract: Video instance segmentation (VIS) has gained significant attention for its
capability in tracking and segmenting object instances across video frames.
However, most of the existing VIS approaches unrealistically assume that the
categories of object instances remain fixed over time. Moreover, they
experience catastrophic forgetting of old classes when required to continuously
learn object instances belonging to new categories. To resolve these
challenges, we develop a novel Hierarchical Visual Prompt Learning (HVPL) model
that overcomes catastrophic forgetting of previous categories from both
frame-level and video-level perspectives. Specifically, to mitigate forgetting
at the frame level, we devise a task-specific frame prompt and an orthogonal
gradient correction (OGC) module. The OGC module helps the frame prompt encode
task-specific global instance information for new classes in each individual
frame by projecting its gradients onto the orthogonal feature space of old
classes. Furthermore, to address forgetting at the video level, we design a
task-specific video prompt and a video context decoder. This decoder first
embeds structural inter-class relationships across frames into the frame prompt
features, and then propagates task-specific global video contexts from the
frame prompt features to the video prompt. Through rigorous comparisons, our
HVPL model proves to be more effective than baseline approaches. The code is
available at https://github.com/JiahuaDong/HVPL.

Conclusion: AME是一种即插即用的模块，无需修改主干网络，适用于多种视觉-语言蒸馏框架。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a long-established technique for knowledge
transfer, and has regained attention in the context of the recent emergence of
large vision-language models (VLMs). However, vision-language knowledge
distillation often requires sufficient training data to achieve robust
generalization on amples with ambiguous or boundary-adjacent representations,
which are associated with high predictive uncertainty. Critically, collecting
such large-scale, task-specific data for training is often impractical in
real-world scenarios. To address this major challenge arising from the
entanglement of uncertainty and cross-modal feature representation, we propose
Aligned Manifold Entropy for Robust Vision-Language Distillation (AME), aiming
to achieve robust generalization under real-world conditions. AME applies
entropy minimization over a reconfigured shared manifold, where multi-modal
data (i.e., image and text) are bridged through a pair of projection functions,
conducive to structural compression for cross-modal feature representations.
This enables robust knowledge distillation under low-data regimes, while
requiring no architectural modifications to the backbone. As a result, it can
serve as a plug-and-play module compatible with a wide range of vision-language
distillation frameworks. Notably, our theoretical analysis reveals that
integrating knowledge distillation with entropy minimization over the shared
manifold leads to a tighter generalization error bound. Extensive experiments
across diverse distillation architectures and training settings demonstrate
that AME consistently facilitates robust knowledge distillation, resulting in
superior generalization performance across a wide spectrum of downstream tasks.

Abstract: Most prior unsupervised domain adaptation approaches for medical image
segmentation are narrowly tailored to either the source-accessible setting,
where adaptation is guided by source-target alignment, or the source-free
setting, which typically resorts to implicit supervision mechanisms such as
pseudo-labeling and model distillation. This substantial divergence in
methodological designs between the two settings reveals an inherent flaw: the
lack of an explicit, structured construction of anatomical knowledge that
naturally generalizes across domains and settings. To bridge this longstanding
divide, we introduce a unified, semantically grounded framework that supports
both source-accessible and source-free adaptation. Fundamentally distinct from
all prior works, our framework's adaptability emerges naturally as a direct
consequence of the model architecture, without the need for any handcrafted
adaptation strategies. Specifically, our model learns a domain-agnostic
probabilistic manifold as a global space of anatomical regularities, mirroring
how humans establish visual understanding. Thus, the structural content in each
image can be interpreted as a canonical anatomy retrieved from the manifold and
a spatial transformation capturing individual-specific geometry. This
disentangled, interpretable formulation enables semantically meaningful
prediction with intrinsic adaptability. Extensive experiments on challenging
cardiac and abdominal datasets show that our framework achieves
state-of-the-art results in both settings, with source-free performance closely
approaching its source-accessible counterpart, a level of consistency rarely
observed in prior works. Beyond quantitative improvement, we demonstrate strong
interpretability of the proposed framework via manifold traversal for smooth
shape manipulation.

Conclusion: MMIF-AMIN在多模态医学图像融合任务中表现优异，且可扩展至其他图像融合任务。

Abstract: Multimodal medical image fusion (MMIF) aims to integrate images from
different modalities to produce a comprehensive image that enhances medical
diagnosis by accurately depicting organ structures, tissue textures, and
metabolic information. Capturing both the unique and complementary information
across multiple modalities simultaneously is a key research challenge in MMIF.
To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel image fusion method,
MMIF-AMIN, which features a new architecture that can effectively extract these
unique and complementary features. Specifically, an Invertible Dense Network
(IDN) is employed for lossless feature extraction from individual modalities.
To extract complementary information between modalities, a Multi-scale
Complementary Feature Extraction Module (MCFEM) is designed, which incorporates
a hybrid attention mechanism, convolutional layers of varying sizes, and
Transformers. An adaptive loss function is introduced to guide model learning,

TL;DR: PADReg是一种基于物理感知的超声图像变形配准框架，利用接触力作为物理先验，显著提高了配准精度和解剖对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超声图像变形配准在捕捉生物力学特性和提高疾病诊断准确性方面至关重要，但现有方法在大变形下表现不佳，缺乏物理可解释性。

Method: PADReg通过结合接触力和超声图像的多模态信息构建像素级刚度图，并利用轻量级物理感知模块估计变形场。

Result: 实验表明，PADReg的HD95为12.90，比现有方法提高了21.34%。

Conclusion: PADReg通过引入物理先验，实现了更准确的超声图像配准，为临床应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Ultrasound deformable registration estimates spatial transformations between
pairs of deformed ultrasound images, which is crucial for capturing
biomechanical properties and enhancing diagnostic accuracy in diseases such as
thyroid nodules and breast cancer. However, ultrasound deformable registration
remains highly challenging, especially under large deformation. The inherently
low contrast, heavy noise and ambiguous tissue boundaries in ultrasound images
severely hinder reliable feature extraction and correspondence matching.
Existing methods often suffer from poor anatomical alignment and lack physical
interpretability. To address the problem, we propose PADReg, a physics-aware
deformable registration framework guided by contact force. PADReg leverages
synchronized contact force measured by robotic ultrasound systems as a physical
prior to constrain the registration. Specifically, instead of directly
predicting deformation fields, we first construct a pixel-wise stiffness map
utilizing the multi-modal information from contact force and ultrasound images.
The stiffness map is then combined with force data to estimate a dense
deformation field, through a lightweight physics-aware module inspired by
Hooke's law. This design enables PADReg to achieve physically plausible
registration with better anatomical alignment than previous methods relying
solely on image similarity. Experiments on in-vivo datasets demonstrate that it
attains a HD95 of 12.90, which is 21.34\% better than state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合机器人超声和实时形状补全的新系统，用于增强脊柱可视化，解决了传统方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超声成像在脊柱手术中的应用受到阴影伪影的限制，传统方法如CT-to-US配准存在复杂性和脊柱曲率差异等问题。

Method: 开发了一个集成的机器人平台，自主获取腰椎超声扫描，通过深度学习形状补全网络重建完整解剖结构。

Result: 系统实现了交互式实时可视化，能够自主重复扫描并导航到目标位置，提高了准确性和可重复性。

Conclusion: 该系统在脊柱可视化方面表现出色，具有潜在临床应用价值。

Abstract: Ultrasound (US) imaging is increasingly used in spinal procedures due to its
real-time, radiation-free capabilities; however, its effectiveness is hindered
by shadowing artifacts that obscure deeper tissue structures. Traditional
approaches, such as CT-to-US registration, incorporate anatomical information
from preoperative CT scans to guide interventions, but they are limited by
complex registration requirements, differences in spine curvature, and the need
for recent CT imaging. Recent shape completion methods can offer an alternative
by reconstructing spinal structures in US data, while being pretrained on large
set of publicly available CT scans. However, these approaches are typically
offline and have limited reproducibility. In this work, we introduce a novel
integrated system that combines robotic ultrasound with real-time shape
completion to enhance spinal visualization. Our robotic platform autonomously
acquires US sweeps of the lumbar spine, extracts vertebral surfaces from
ultrasound, and reconstructs the complete anatomy using a deep learning-based
shape completion network. This framework provides interactive, real-time
visualization with the capability to autonomously repeat scans and can enable
navigation to target locations. This can contribute to better consistency,
reproducibility, and understanding of the underlying anatomy. We validate our
approach through quantitative experiments assessing shape completion accuracy
and evaluations of multiple spine acquisition protocols on a phantom setup.
Additionally, we present qualitative results of the visualization on a
volunteer scan.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种仅使用RGB图像的越野自由空间检测方法ROD，避免了LiDAR数据的计算负担，实现了更高的推理速度和精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 越野场景中自由空间检测的边界模糊，现有方法依赖LiDAR数据导致推理时间增加，不适合实时应用。

Method: 利用预训练的Vision Transformer (ViT)提取RGB图像特征，并设计轻量高效的解码器。

Result: ROD在ORFD和RELLIS-3D数据集上达到新的SOTA，推理速度达50 FPS。

Conclusion: ROD通过RGB-only方法解决了实时性问题，显著优于现有模型。

Abstract: Off-road freespace detection is more challenging than on-road scenarios
because of the blurred boundaries of traversable areas. Previous
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods employ multi-modal fusion of RGB images and
LiDAR data. However, due to the significant increase in inference time when
calculating surface normal maps from LiDAR data, multi-modal methods are not
suitable for real-time applications, particularly in real-world scenarios where
higher FPS is required compared to slow navigation. This paper presents a novel
RGB-only approach for off-road freespace detection, named ROD, eliminating the
reliance on LiDAR data and its computational demands. Specifically, we utilize
a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) to extract rich features from RGB
images. Additionally, we design a lightweight yet efficient decoder, which
together improve both precision and inference speed. ROD establishes a new SOTA
on ORFD and RELLIS-3D datasets, as well as an inference speed of 50 FPS,
significantly outperforming prior models.

Conclusion: 该方法在数据稀缺的实际应用中具有显著价值。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
predicting agent movements within virtual environments and real-world scenarios
based on visual observations and textual instructions. Although recent research
has focused on enhancing spatial and temporal understanding independently, this
paper presents a novel approach that integrates both aspects through visual
prompting. We introduce a method that projects visual traces of key points from
observations onto depth maps, enabling models to capture both spatial and
temporal information simultaneously. The experiments in SimplerEnv show that
the mean number of tasks successfully solved increased for 4% compared to
SpatialVLA and 19% compared to TraceVLA. Furthermore, we show that this
enhancement can be achieved with minimal training data, making it particularly
valuable for real-world applications where data collection is challenging. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高清晰度视频压缩中的条带伪影严重影响观看质量，现有数据集仅针对静态图像，无法捕捉时间动态，因此需要系统性研究。

Method: 创建了LIVE-YT-Banding数据集，包含160个视频和7,200条主观评价；提出CBAND模型，利用深度神经网络嵌入的自然图像统计特性。

Result: CBAND在条带伪影预测性能上显著优于现有模型，且速度更快，还可作为可微损失函数优化视频去条带模型。

Conclusion: CBAND和LIVE-YT-Banding数据集为视频质量评估提供了新工具，推动了相关研究的发展。

Abstract: Although there have been notable advancements in video compression
technologies in recent years, banding artifacts remain a serious issue
affecting the quality of compressed videos, particularly on smooth regions of
high-definition videos. Noticeable banding artifacts can severely impact the
perceptual quality of videos viewed on a high-end HDTV or high-resolution
screen. Hence, there is a pressing need for a systematic investigation of the
banding video quality assessment problem for advanced video codecs. Given that
the existing publicly available datasets for studying banding artifacts are
limited to still picture data only, which cannot account for temporal banding
dynamics, we have created a first-of-a-kind open video dataset, dubbed
LIVE-YT-Banding, which consists of 160 videos generated by four different
compression parameters using the AV1 video codec. A total of 7,200 subjective
opinions are collected from a cohort of 45 human subjects. To demonstrate the
value of this new resources, we tested and compared a variety of models that
detect banding occurrences, and measure their impact on perceived quality.
Among these, we introduce an effective and efficient new no-reference (NR)
video quality evaluator which we call CBAND. CBAND leverages the properties of
the learned statistics of natural images expressed in the embeddings of deep
neural networks. Our experimental results show that the perceptual banding
prediction performance of CBAND significantly exceeds that of previous
state-of-the-art models, and is also orders of magnitude faster. Moreover,
CBAND can be employed as a differentiable loss function to optimize video
debanding models. The LIVE-YT-Banding database, code, and pre-trained model are
all publically available at https://github.com/uniqzheng/CBAND.

Conclusion: 该方法通过生成和过滤合成数据，有效修复了视觉识别模型的系统性错误。

Abstract: Deep learning models for visual recognition often exhibit systematic errors
due to underrepresented semantic subpopulations. Although existing debugging
frameworks can pinpoint these failures by identifying key failure attributes,
repairing the model effectively remains difficult. Current solutions often rely
on manually designed prompts to generate synthetic training images -- an
approach prone to distribution shift and semantic errors. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce a model repair module that builds on an interpretable
failure attribution pipeline. Our approach uses a conditional text-to-image
model to generate semantically faithful and targeted images for failure cases.
To preserve the quality and relevance of the generated samples, we further
employ a large vision-language model (LVLM) to filter the outputs, enforcing
alignment with the original data distribution and maintaining semantic
consistency. By retraining vision models with this rare-case-augmented
synthetic dataset, we significantly reduce errors associated with rare cases.
Our experiments demonstrate that this targeted repair strategy improves model
robustness without introducing new bugs. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应置信损失（ACW）用于眼内透镜结构分割，通过动态调整置信阈值和区域加权损失，显著提升了分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度分割网络对所有像素平等加权，忽略了透镜结构子区域的不均匀性和边界区域的校准问题。临床专家标注时对不同子区域有不同置信度，这启发了ACW的设计。

Method: ACW将目标区域分为低置信和高置信组，应用区域加权损失，并设计动态置信阈值优化算法。同时提出边界预期校准误差（BECE）度量边界分割的校准误差。

Result: 在临床AS-OCT数据集和其他多结构数据集上，ACW显著优于其他分割损失方法，如IoU提升6.13%，DSC增加4.33%，BECE降低4.79%。

Conclusion: ACW通过利用专家标注置信度先验，有效提升了透镜结构分割的性能和校准精度。

Abstract: Precise lens structure segmentation is essential for the design of
intraocular lenses (IOLs) in cataract surgery. Existing deep segmentation
networks typically weight all pixels equally under cross-entropy (CE) loss,
overlooking the fact that sub-regions of lens structures are inhomogeneous
(e.g., some regions perform better than others) and that boundary regions often
suffer from poor segmentation calibration at the pixel level. Clinically,
experts annotate different sub-regions of lens structures with varying
confidence levels, considering factors such as sub-region proportions,
ambiguous boundaries, and lens structure shapes. Motivated by this observation,
we propose an Adaptive Confidence-Wise (ACW) loss to group each lens structure
sub-region into different confidence sub-regions via a confidence threshold
from the unique region aspect, aiming to exploit the potential of expert
annotation confidence prior. Specifically, ACW clusters each target region into
low-confidence and high-confidence groups and then applies a region-weighted
loss to reweigh each confidence group. Moreover, we design an adaptive
confidence threshold optimization algorithm to adjust the confidence threshold
of ACW dynamically. Additionally, to better quantify the miscalibration errors
in boundary region segmentation, we propose a new metric, termed Boundary
Expected Calibration Error (BECE). Extensive experiments on a clinical lens
structure AS-OCT dataset and other multi-structure datasets demonstrate that
our ACW significantly outperforms competitive segmentation loss methods across
different deep segmentation networks (e.g., MedSAM). Notably, our method
surpasses CE with 6.13% IoU gain, 4.33% DSC increase, and 4.79% BECE reduction
in lens structure segmentation under U-Net. The code of this paper is available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种模拟社交媒体视频共享管道的框架，用于生成压缩和调整大小的参数，以改进深度伪造检测器的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体平台对视频的专有压缩破坏了低级法医线索，导致现有检测器在真实场景中表现不佳。

Method: 通过估计上传视频的压缩和调整大小参数，构建本地模拟器，无需直接访问API即可生成平台特定的伪影。

Result: 实验表明，模拟数据与真实上传视频的退化模式高度匹配，检测器在模拟数据上微调后性能接近真实共享媒体上的训练效果。

Conclusion: 该框架为实验室训练与真实世界部署之间的差距提供了可扩展且实用的解决方案，尤其在压缩视频内容领域。

Abstract: The growing presence of AI-generated videos on social networks poses new
challenges for deepfake detection, as detectors trained under controlled
conditions often fail to generalize to real-world scenarios. A key factor
behind this gap is the aggressive, proprietary compression applied by platforms
like YouTube and Facebook, which launder low-level forensic cues. However,
replicating these transformations at scale is difficult due to API limitations
and data-sharing constraints. For these reasons, we propose a first framework
that emulates the video sharing pipelines of social networks by estimating
compression and resizing parameters from a small set of uploaded videos. These
parameters enable a local emulator capable of reproducing platform-specific
artifacts on large datasets without direct API access. Experiments on
FaceForensics++ videos shared via social networks demonstrate that our emulated
data closely matches the degradation patterns of real uploads. Furthermore,
detectors fine-tuned on emulated videos achieve comparable performance to those
trained on actual shared media. Our approach offers a scalable and practical
solution for bridging the gap between lab-based training and real-world
deployment of deepfake detectors, particularly in the underexplored domain of
compressed video content.

TL;DR: ROOMELSA是一个新的基准测试，旨在评估系统在复杂场景中通过自然语言描述检索3D模型的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D检索系统适用于简单场景，而真实世界场景更复杂，需要从模糊的自由描述中识别物体。

Method: ROOMELSA通过在全景房间图像中定位特定区域，并从大型数据库中检索对应的3D模型。

Result: 尽管粗粒度物体检索已基本解决，但只有少数模型在所有测试案例中表现优异。轻量级CLIP模型表现良好，但在细微差异上仍有不足。

Conclusion: ROOMELSA为推进真实世界3D识别系统提供了新基准，强调了视觉与语言理解的紧密结合。

Abstract: Recent 3D retrieval systems are typically designed for simple, controlled
scenarios, such as identifying an object from a cropped image or a brief
description. However, real-world scenarios are more complex, often requiring
the recognition of an object in a cluttered scene based on a vague, free-form
description. To this end, we present ROOMELSA, a new benchmark designed to
evaluate a system's ability to interpret natural language. Specifically,
ROOMELSA attends to a specific region within a panoramic room image and
accurately retrieves the corresponding 3D model from a large database. In
addition, ROOMELSA includes over 1,600 apartment scenes, nearly 5,200 rooms,
and more than 44,000 targeted queries. Empirically, while coarse object
retrieval is largely solved, only one top-performing model consistently ranked
the correct match first across nearly all test cases. Notably, a lightweight
CLIP-based model also performed well, although it struggled with subtle
variations in materials, part structures, and contextual cues, resulting in
occasional errors. These findings highlight the importance of tightly
integrating visual and language understanding. By bridging the gap between
scene-level grounding and fine-grained 3D retrieval, ROOMELSA establishes a new
benchmark for advancing robust, real-world 3D recognition systems.

Result: 在公开数据集上验证了方法的有效性，尤其在物种多样性和遮挡场景下表现优异。

Conclusion: DiffPose-Animal为动物姿态估计提供了鲁棒且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Animal pose estimation is a fundamental task in computer vision, with growing
importance in ecological monitoring, behavioral analysis, and intelligent
livestock management. Compared to human pose estimation, animal pose estimation
is more challenging due to high interspecies morphological diversity, complex
body structures, and limited annotated data. In this work, we introduce
DiffPose-Animal, a novel diffusion-based framework for top-down animal pose
estimation. Unlike traditional heatmap regression methods, DiffPose-Animal
reformulates pose estimation as a denoising process under the generative
framework of diffusion models. To enhance semantic guidance during keypoint
generation, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to extract both global
anatomical priors and local keypoint-wise semantics based on species-specific
prompts. These textual priors are encoded and fused with image features via
cross-attention modules to provide biologically meaningful constraints
throughout the denoising process. Additionally, a diffusion-based keypoint
decoder is designed to progressively refine pose predictions, improving
robustness to occlusion and annotation sparsity. Extensive experiments on
public animal pose datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization
capability of our method, especially under challenging scenarios with diverse
species, cluttered backgrounds, and incomplete keypoints.

Motivation: 传统均匀锐化强度忽略纹理变化，降低视频质量并增加比特率，缺乏优化比特分配的技术。

Method: 利用编码树单元（CTU）分区掩码作为先验信息，指导并约束增加的比特分配。

Result: 在基准测试中，模型在质量和比特率节省方面均表现出色。

Conclusion: RPO-AdaSharp模型有效解决了视频锐化中的比特分配问题，实现了质量和效率的双重提升。

Abstract: Sharpening is a widely adopted video enhancement technique. However, uniform
sharpening intensity ignores texture variations, degrading video quality.
Sharpening also increases bitrate, and there's a lack of techniques to
optimally allocate these additional bits across diverse regions. Thus, this
paper proposes RPO-AdaSharp, an end-to-end region-adaptive video sharpening
model for both perceptual enhancement and bitrate savings. We use the coding
tree unit (CTU) partition mask as prior information to guide and constrain the
allocation of increased bits. Experiments on benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed model qualitatively and quantitatively.

Conclusion: MonoPartNeRF在复杂姿态和遮挡条件下表现优异，为动态人体渲染提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have achieved remarkable
progress in dynamic human reconstruction and rendering. Part-based rendering
paradigms, guided by human segmentation, allow for flexible parameter
allocation based on structural complexity, thereby enhancing representational
efficiency. However, existing methods still struggle with complex pose
variations, often producing unnatural transitions at part boundaries and
failing to reconstruct occluded regions accurately in monocular settings. We
propose MonoPartNeRF, a novel framework for monocular dynamic human rendering
that ensures smooth transitions and robust occlusion recovery. First, we build
a bidirectional deformation model that combines rigid and non-rigid
transformations to establish a continuous, reversible mapping between
observation and canonical spaces. Sampling points are projected into a
parameterized surface-time space (u, v, t) to better capture non-rigid motion.
A consistency loss further suppresses deformation-induced artifacts and
discontinuities. We introduce a part-based pose embedding mechanism that
decomposes global pose vectors into local joint embeddings based on body
regions. This is combined with keyframe pose retrieval and interpolation, along
three orthogonal directions, to guide pose-aware feature sampling. A learnable
appearance code is integrated via attention to model dynamic texture changes
effectively. Experiments on the ZJU-MoCap and MonoCap datasets demonstrate that
our method significantly outperforms prior approaches under complex pose and
occlusion conditions, achieving superior joint alignment, texture fidelity, and
structural continuity.

Conclusion: 方法简单实用，能有效合成年龄变化的人脸并保留身份。

Abstract: Face aging or de-aging with generative AI has gained significant attention
for its applications in such fields like forensics, security, and media.
However, most state of the art methods rely on conditional Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs), Diffusion-based models, or Visual Language Models
(VLMs) to age or de-age faces based on predefined age categories and
conditioning via loss functions, fine-tuning, or text prompts. The reliance on
such conditioning leads to complex training requirements, increased data needs,
and challenges in generating consistent results. Additionally, identity
preservation is rarely taken into accountor evaluated on a single face
recognition system without any control or guarantees on whether identity would
be preserved in a generated aged/de-aged face. In this paper, we propose to
synthesize aged and de-aged faces via editing latent space of StyleGAN2 using a
simple support vector modeling of aging/de-aging direction and several feature
selection approaches. By using two state-of-the-art face recognition systems,
we empirically find the identity preserving subspace within the StyleGAN2
latent space, so that an apparent age of a given face can changed while
preserving the identity. We then propose a simple yet practical formula for
estimating the limits on aging/de-aging parameters that ensures identity
preservation for a given input face. Using our method and estimated parameters
we have generated a public dataset of synthetic faces at different ages that
can be used for benchmarking cross-age face recognition, age assurance systems,
or systems for detection of synthetic images. Our code and dataset are
available at the project page https://www.idiap.ch/paper/agesynth/

Motivation: 现有轻量级语义分割方法在实时推理中表现良好，但其基于逐像素分类的范式导致类别表示与图像特征不对齐，限制了性能。

Method: 提出耦合双分支偏移学习范式，显式学习特征和类别偏移，动态优化类别表示和空间图像特征，并构建了高效网络OffSeg。

Conclusion: 偏移学习范式能有效解决类别表示与特征不对齐问题，且无需额外架构改动，适用于现有方法。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is fundamental to vision systems requiring pixel-level
scene understanding, yet deploying it on resource-constrained devices demands
efficient architectures. Although existing methods achieve real-time inference
through lightweight designs, we reveal their inherent limitation: misalignment
between class representations and image features caused by a per-pixel
classification paradigm. With experimental analysis, we find that this paradigm
results in a highly challenging assumption for efficient scenarios: Image pixel
features should not vary for the same category in different images. To address
this dilemma, we propose a coupled dual-branch offset learning paradigm that
explicitly learns feature and class offsets to dynamically refine both class
representations and spatial image features. Based on the proposed paradigm, we
construct an efficient semantic segmentation network, OffSeg. Notably, the
offset learning paradigm can be adopted to existing methods with no additional
architectural changes. Extensive experiments on four datasets, including
ADE20K, Cityscapes, COCO-Stuff-164K, and Pascal Context, demonstrate consistent
improvements with negligible parameters. For instance, on the ADE20K dataset,
our proposed offset learning paradigm improves SegFormer-B0, SegNeXt-T, and
Mask2Former-Tiny by 2.7%, 1.9%, and 2.6% mIoU, respectively, with only 0.1-0.2M

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为TARA的方法，通过引入令牌掩码和训练目标，解决了多概念LoRA模块组合时的干扰和空间对齐问题，实现了高效的多概念图像生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LoRA的方法在多概念生成时存在身份缺失和视觉特征泄漏问题，需要解决令牌干扰和空间对齐问题。

Method: 提出Token-Aware LoRA (TARA)，引入令牌掩码避免模块间干扰，并通过训练目标确保令牌注意力与概念区域对齐。

Result: 实验表明TARA能高效实现多概念推理，并有效保留每个概念的视觉身份。

Conclusion: TARA通过独立训练的模块直接组合，解决了多概念生成的干扰问题，提升了生成质量。

Abstract: Personalized text-to-image generation aims to synthesize novel images of a
specific subject or style using only a few reference images. Recent methods
based on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) enable efficient single-concept
customization by injecting lightweight, concept-specific adapters into
pre-trained diffusion models. However, combining multiple LoRA modules for
multi-concept generation often leads to identity missing and visual feature
leakage. In this work, we identify two key issues behind these failures: (1)
token-wise interference among different LoRA modules, and (2) spatial
misalignment between the attention map of a rare token and its corresponding
concept-specific region. To address these issues, we propose Token-Aware LoRA
(TARA), which introduces a token mask to explicitly constrain each module to
focus on its associated rare token to avoid interference, and a training
objective that encourages the spatial attention of a rare token to align with
its concept region. Our method enables training-free multi-concept composition
by directly injecting multiple independently trained TARA modules at inference
time. Experimental results demonstrate that TARA enables efficient
multi-concept inference and effectively preserving the visual identity of each
concept by avoiding mutual interference between LoRA modules. The code and
models are available at https://github.com/YuqiPeng77/TARA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3DFroMLLM框架通过多模态大语言模型生成3D对象原型，无需额外训练数据或详细用户指令，显著提升了空间推理能力和视觉语言模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在空间推理方面表现有限，需要一种无需额外数据或复杂指令的方法来生成3D对象原型。

Method: 提出3DFroMLLM框架，包含设计师、编码器和视觉检查器组成的代理循环，直接从MLLMs生成3D对象原型（几何和部分标签）。

Result: 生成的渲染图像在图像分类预训练任务中表现优于先前方法15%，并在细粒度视觉语言模型微调中实现55%的准确率提升。

Conclusion: 3DFroMLLM框架有效提升了MLLMs的空间推理能力，并在实际应用中展示了显著性能改进。

Abstract: Recent Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong
capabilities in learning joint representations from text and images. However,
their spatial reasoning remains limited. We introduce 3DFroMLLM, a novel
framework that enables the generation of 3D object prototypes directly from
MLLMs, including geometry and part labels. Our pipeline is agentic, comprising
a designer, coder, and visual inspector operating in a refinement loop.
Notably, our approach requires no additional training data or detailed user
instructions. Building on prior work in 2D generation, we demonstrate that
rendered images produced by our framework can be effectively used for image
classification pretraining tasks and outperforms previous methods by 15%. As a
compelling real-world use case, we show that the generated prototypes can be
leveraged to improve fine-grained vision-language models by using the rendered,
part-labeled prototypes to fine-tune CLIP for part segmentation and achieving a
55% accuracy improvement without relying on any additional human-labeled data.

### [148] [A Parametric Bi-Directional Curvature-Based Framework for Image Artifact Classification and Quantification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08824)
*Diego Frias*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于方向图像曲率分析的无参考图像质量评估（NR-IQA）框架，通过定义各向异性纹理丰富度（ATR）作为质量度量，实现了高精度分类和量化图像退化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像质量评估方法难以准确分类和量化不同类型的图像退化，需要一种更高效且准确的框架。

Method: 提出ATR度量，利用两个可调阈值计算像素级纹理抑制，并通过两阶段系统（分类和回归）实现高精度评估。

Result: 在LIVE数据集上，ATR对高斯模糊和白噪声的Spearman相关系数分别达到-0.93和-0.95；分类准确率超97%，R2为0.892，RMSE为5.17 DMOS。

Conclusion: 该框架是一种高效的双用途工具，能够高精度分类和量化图像退化。

Abstract: This work presents a novel framework for No-Reference Image Quality
Assessment (NR-IQA) founded on the analysis of directional image curvature.
Within this framework, we define a measure of Anisotropic Texture Richness
(ATR), which is computed at the pixel level using two tunable thresholds -- one
permissive and one restrictive -- that quantify orthogonal texture suppression.
When its parameters are optimized for a specific artifact, the resulting ATR
score serves as a high-performance quality metric, achieving Spearman
correlations with human perception of approximately -0.93 for Gaussian blur and
-0.95 for white noise on the LIVE dataset. The primary contribution is a
two-stage system that leverages the differential response of ATR to various
distortions. First, the system utilizes the signature from two specialist ATR
configurations to classify the primary artifact type (blur vs. noise) with over
97% accuracy. Second, following classification, it employs a dedicated
regression model mapping the relevant ATR score to a quality rating to quantify
the degradation. On a combined dataset, the complete system predicts human
scores with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.892 and a Root Mean Square
Error (RMSE) of 5.17 DMOS points. This error corresponds to just 7.4% of the
dataset's total quality range, demonstrating high predictive accuracy. This
establishes our framework as a robust, dual-purpose tool for the classification
and subsequent quantification of image degradation.

Motivation: 高频分量对视频清晰度和真实感至关重要，但会增加比特率，导致带宽和存储成本上升。

Method: 使用频率注意力特征金字塔预测网络（FFPN）预测最优高频预处理策略，并通过伪标签训练网络。

Result: 在多个数据集上的评估显示，该框架能显著提升视觉质量并节省比特率。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了比特率与质量之间的最优权衡，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: High-frequency components are crucial for maintaining video clarity and
realism, but they also significantly impact coding bitrate, resulting in
increased bandwidth and storage costs. This paper presents an end-to-end
learning-based framework for adaptive high-frequency preprocessing to enhance
subjective quality and save bitrate in video coding. The framework employs the
Frequency-attentive Feature pyramid Prediction Network (FFPN) to predict the
optimal high-frequency preprocessing strategy, guiding subsequent filtering
operators to achieve the optimal tradeoff between bitrate and quality after
compression. For training FFPN, we pseudo-label each training video with the
optimal strategy, determined by comparing the rate-distortion (RD) performance
across different preprocessing types and strengths. Distortion is measured
using the latest quality assessment metric. Comprehensive evaluations on
multiple datasets demonstrate the visually appealing enhancement capabilities
and bitrate savings achieved by our framework.

Conclusion: GaussianUpdate在动态场景的新视角合成中表现出色。

Abstract: Novel view synthesis with neural models has advanced rapidly in recent years,
yet adapting these models to scene changes remains an open problem. Existing
methods are either labor-intensive, requiring extensive model retraining, or
fail to capture detailed types of changes over time. In this paper, we present
GaussianUpdate, a novel approach that combines 3D Gaussian representation with
continual learning to address these challenges. Our method effectively updates
the Gaussian radiance fields with current data while preserving information
from past scenes. Unlike existing methods, GaussianUpdate explicitly models
different types of changes through a novel multi-stage update strategy.
Additionally, we introduce a visibility-aware continual learning approach with
generative replay, enabling self-aware updating without the need to store
images. The experiments on the benchmark dataset demonstrate our method
achieves superior and real-time rendering with the capability of visualizing
changes over different times

Abstract: Robust depth estimation in light field imaging remains a critical challenge
for pattern recognition applications such as augmented reality, biomedical
imaging, and scene reconstruction. While existing approaches often rely heavily
on deep convolutional neural networks, they tend to incur high computational
costs and struggle in noisy real-world environments. This paper proposes a
novel lightweight depth estimation pipeline that integrates light field-based
disparity information with a directed random walk refinement algorithm. Unlike
traditional CNN-based methods, our approach enhances depth map consistency
without requiring extensive training or large-scale datasets. The proposed
method was evaluated on the 4D Light Field Benchmark dataset and a diverse set
of real-world images. Experimental results indicate that while performance
slightly declines under uncontrolled conditions, the algorithm consistently
maintains low computational complexity and competitive accuracy compared to
state-of-the-art deep learning models. These findings highlight the potential
of our method as a robust and efficient alternative for depth estimation and
segmentation in light field imaging. The work provides insights into practical
algorithm design for light field-based pattern recognition and opens new
directions for integrating probabilistic graph models with depth sensing
frameworks.

Abstract: Vision transformers (ViTs) have recently been widely applied to 3D point
cloud understanding, with masked autoencoding as the predominant pre-training
paradigm. However, the challenge of learning dense and informative semantic
features from point clouds via standard ViTs remains underexplored. We propose
MaskClu, a novel unsupervised pre-training method for ViTs on 3D point clouds
that integrates masked point modeling with clustering-based learning. MaskClu
is designed to reconstruct both cluster assignments and cluster centers from
masked point clouds, thus encouraging the model to capture dense semantic
information. Additionally, we introduce a global contrastive learning mechanism
that enhances instance-level feature learning by contrasting different masked
views of the same point cloud. By jointly optimizing these complementary
objectives, i.e., dense semantic reconstruction, and instance-level contrastive
learning. MaskClu enables ViTs to learn richer and more semantically meaningful
representations from 3D point clouds. We validate the effectiveness of our
method via multiple 3D tasks, including part segmentation, semantic
segmentation, object detection, and classification, where MaskClu sets new
competitive results. The code and models will be released

Abstract: Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is essential for evaluating central nervous
system (CNS) tumors, guiding surgical planning, treatment decisions, and
assessing postoperative outcomes and complication risks. While recent work has
advanced automated tumor segmentation and report generation, most efforts have
focused on preoperative data, with limited attention to postoperative imaging
analysis. This study introduces a comprehensive pipeline for standardized
postsurtical reporting in CNS tumors. Using the Attention U-Net architecture,
segmentation models were trained for the preoperative (non-enhancing) tumor
core, postoperative contrast-enhancing residual tumor, and resection cavity.
Additionally, MR sequence classification and tumor type identification for
contrast-enhancing lesions were explored using the DenseNet architecture. The
models were integrated into a reporting pipeline, following the RANO 2.0
guidelines. Training was conducted on multicentric datasets comprising 2000 to
7000 patients, using a 5-fold cross-validation. Evaluation included patient-,
voxel-, and object-wise metrics, with benchmarking against the latest BraTS
challenge results. The segmentation models achieved average voxel-wise Dice
scores of 87%, 66%, 70%, and 77% for the tumor core, non-enhancing tumor core,
contrast-enhancing residual tumor, and resection cavity, respectively.
Classification models reached 99.5% balanced accuracy in MR sequence
classification and 80% in tumor type classification. The pipeline presented in
this study enables robust, automated segmentation, MR sequence classification,
and standardized report generation aligned with RANO 2.0 guidelines, enhancing
postoperative evaluation and clinical decision-making. The proposed models and
methods were integrated into Raidionics, open-source software platform for CNS
tumor analysis, now including a dedicated module for postsurgical analysis.

Conclusion: 通过几何建模和流形学习，新方法能够更准确地捕捉数据分布和类间依赖关系，提升了LiDAR地点识别的效果。

Abstract: LiDAR-based Place Recognition (LPR) remains a critical task in Embodied
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Autonomous Driving, primarily addressing
localization challenges in GPS-denied environments and supporting loop closure
detection. Existing approaches reduce place recognition to a Euclidean
distance-based metric learning task, neglecting the feature space's intrinsic
structures and intra-class variances. Such Euclidean-centric formulation
inherently limits the model's capacity to capture nonlinear data distributions,
leading to suboptimal performance in complex environments and temporal-varying
scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel cross-view network
based on an innovative fusion paradigm. Our framework introduces a
pseudo-global information guidance mechanism that coordinates multi-modal
branches to perform feature learning within a unified semantic space.
Concurrently, we propose a Manifold Adaptation and Pairwise Variance-Locality
Learning Metric that constructs a Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrix to
compute Mahalanobis distance, superseding traditional Euclidean distance
metrics. This geometric formulation enables the model to accurately
characterize intrinsic data distributions and capture complex inter-class
dependencies within the feature space. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed algorithm achieves competitive performance, particularly excelling
in complex environmental conditions.

Conclusion: 该方法为体数据压缩提供了高效、无结构的解决方案，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Volumetric data compression is critical in fields like medical imaging,
scientific simulation, and entertainment. We introduce a structure-free neural
compression method combining Fourierfeature encoding with selective voxel
sampling, yielding compact volumetric representations and faster convergence.
Our dynamic voxel selection uses morphological dilation to prioritize active
regions, reducing redundant computation without any hierarchical metadata. In
the experiment, sparse training reduced training time by 63.7 % (from 30 to 11
minutes) with only minor quality loss: PSNR dropped 0.59 dB (from 32.60 to
32.01) and SSIM by 0.008 (from 0.948 to 0.940). The resulting neural
representation, stored solely as network weights, achieves a compression rate
of 14 and eliminates traditional data-loading overhead. This connects
coordinate-based neural representation with efficient volumetric compression,
offering a scalable, structure-free solution for practical applications.

Motivation: 面部变形攻击（MAD）是面部识别安全中的关键挑战，现有方法多依赖微调，忽略了基础模型（如CLIP）的直接通用性潜力。

Result: 提示聚合显著提升了零样本检测性能，验证了通过高效提示工程利用基础模型内置多模态知识的有效性。

Conclusion: 研究表明，无需微调的基础模型可通过提示工程有效应对MAD任务，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Face Morphing Attack Detection (MAD) is a critical challenge in face
recognition security, where attackers can fool systems by interpolating the
identity information of two or more individuals into a single face image,
resulting in samples that can be verified as belonging to multiple identities
by face recognition systems. While multimodal foundation models (FMs) like CLIP
offer strong zero-shot capabilities by jointly modeling images and text, most
prior works on FMs for biometric recognition have relied on fine-tuning for
specific downstream tasks, neglecting their potential for direct, generalizable
deployment. This work explores a pure zero-shot approach to MAD by leveraging
CLIP without any additional training or fine-tuning, focusing instead on the
design and aggregation of multiple textual prompts per class. By aggregating
the embeddings of diverse prompts, we better align the model's internal
representations with the MAD task, capturing richer and more varied cues
indicative of bona-fide or attack samples. Our results show that prompt
aggregation substantially improves zero-shot detection performance,
demonstrating the effectiveness of exploiting foundation models' built-in
multimodal knowledge through efficient prompt engineering.

Abstract: Skeleton-based action recognition (SAR) has achieved impressive progress with
transformer architectures. However, existing methods often rely on complex
module compositions and heavy designs, leading to increased parameter counts,
high computational costs, and limited scalability. In this paper, we propose a
unified spatio-temporal lightweight transformer framework that integrates
spatial and temporal modeling within a single attention module, eliminating the
need for separate temporal modeling blocks. This approach reduces redundant
computations while preserving temporal awareness within the spatial modeling
process. Furthermore, we introduce a simplified multi-scale pooling fusion
module that combines local and global pooling pathways to enhance the model's
ability to capture fine-grained local movements and overarching global motion
patterns. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our
lightweight model achieves a superior balance between accuracy and efficiency,
reducing parameter complexity by over 58% and lowering computational cost by
over 60% compared to state-of-the-art transformer-based baselines, while
maintaining competitive recognition performance.

Result: Lay2Story在一致性、语义相关性和美学质量上优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 布局条件能有效提升生成内容的一致性和控制精度，Lay2Story框架为此类任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Storytelling tasks involving generating consistent subjects have gained
significant attention recently. However, existing methods, whether
training-free or training-based, continue to face challenges in maintaining
subject consistency due to the lack of fine-grained guidance and inter-frame
interaction. Additionally, the scarcity of high-quality data in this field
makes it difficult to precisely control storytelling tasks, including the
subject's position, appearance, clothing, expression, and posture, thereby
hindering further advancements. In this paper, we demonstrate that layout
conditions, such as the subject's position and detailed attributes, effectively
facilitate fine-grained interactions between frames. This not only strengthens
the consistency of the generated frame sequence but also allows for precise
control over the subject's position, appearance, and other key details.
Building on this, we introduce an advanced storytelling task: Layout-Togglable
Storytelling, which enables precise subject control by incorporating layout
conditions. To address the lack of high-quality datasets with layout
annotations for this task, we develop Lay2Story-1M, which contains over 1
million 720p and higher-resolution images, processed from approximately 11,300
hours of cartoon videos. Building on Lay2Story-1M, we create Lay2Story-Bench, a
benchmark with 3,000 prompts designed to evaluate the performance of different
methods on this task. Furthermore, we propose Lay2Story, a robust framework
based on the Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) architecture for Layout-Togglable
Storytelling tasks. Through both qualitative and quantitative experiments, we
find that our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA)
techniques, achieving the best results in terms of consistency, semantic
correlation, and aesthetic quality.

Conclusion: TCSSM和BrightVQA数据集为CDVQA的域泛化研究提供了有效工具。

Abstract: The Earth's surface is constantly changing, and detecting these changes
provides valuable insights that benefit various aspects of human society. While
traditional change detection methods have been employed to detect changes from
bi-temporal images, these approaches typically require expert knowledge for
accurate interpretation. To enable broader and more flexible access to change
information by non-expert users, the task of Change Detection Visual Question
Answering (CDVQA) has been introduced. However, existing CDVQA methods have
been developed under the assumption that training and testing datasets share
similar distributions. This assumption does not hold in real-world
applications, where domain shifts often occur. In this paper, the CDVQA task is
revisited with a focus on addressing domain shift. To this end, a new
multi-modal and multi-domain dataset, BrightVQA, is introduced to facilitate
domain generalization research in CDVQA. Furthermore, a novel state space
model, termed Text-Conditioned State Space Model (TCSSM), is proposed. The
TCSSM framework is designed to leverage both bi-temporal imagery and
geo-disaster-related textual information in an unified manner to extract
domain-invariant features across domains. Input-dependent parameters existing
in TCSSM are dynamically predicted by using both bi-temporal images and
geo-disaster-related description, thereby facilitating the alignment between

### [161] [TaoCache: Structure-Maintained Video Generation Acceleration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08978)
*Zhentao Fan,Zongzuo Wang,Weiwei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TaoCache是一种无需训练、即插即用的缓存策略，通过固定点视角预测噪声输出，特别适用于后期去噪阶段，显著提升视频扩散模型的视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于缓存的加速方法在跳过早期或中期去噪步骤时会导致结构差异，影响指令跟随和角色一致性。

Method: 采用固定点视角预测噪声输出，通过校准余弦相似性和范数比来保留高分辨率结构，支持激进跳过。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，TaoCache在相同加速下比现有缓存方法显著提升了视觉质量（LPIPS、SSIM、PSNR）。

Conclusion: TaoCache是一种高效且兼容性强的缓存策略，适用于DiT框架，并能与其他加速方法无缝集成。

Abstract: Existing cache-based acceleration methods for video diffusion models
primarily skip early or mid denoising steps, which often leads to structural
discrepancies relative to full-timestep generation and can hinder instruction
following and character consistency. We present TaoCache, a training-free,
plug-and-play caching strategy that, instead of residual-based caching, adopts
a fixed-point perspective to predict the model's noise output and is
specifically effective in late denoising stages. By calibrating cosine
similarities and norm ratios of consecutive noise deltas, TaoCache preserves
high-resolution structure while enabling aggressive skipping. The approach is
orthogonal to complementary accelerations such as Pyramid Attention Broadcast
(PAB) and TeaCache, and it integrates seamlessly into DiT-based frameworks.
Across Latte-1, OpenSora-Plan v110, and Wan2.1, TaoCache attains substantially
higher visual quality (LPIPS, SSIM, PSNR) than prior caching methods under the
same speedups.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了使用预训练大型语言模型（LLMs）进行颜色推荐，提出了一种名为ColorGPT的管道，在颜色调色板完成和生成任务中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统颜色推荐方法因复杂性和数据限制表现不佳，研究探索了LLMs的常识推理能力是否能提升颜色推荐效果。

Method: 开发了ColorGPT管道，测试多种颜色表示并应用提示工程技术，专注于颜色调色板完成和生成任务。

Result: 实验表明，ColorGPT在颜色建议准确性和调色板分布上优于现有方法，同时提升了颜色多样性和相似性。

Conclusion: 预训练LLMs可作为颜色推荐任务的优秀设计工具，ColorGPT在多个任务中表现卓越。

Abstract: Colors play a crucial role in the design of vector graphic documents by
enhancing visual appeal, facilitating communication, improving usability, and
ensuring accessibility. In this context, color recommendation involves
suggesting appropriate colors to complete or refine a design when one or more
colors are missing or require alteration. Traditional methods often struggled
with these challenges due to the complex nature of color design and the limited
data availability. In this study, we explored the use of pretrained Large
Language Models (LLMs) and their commonsense reasoning capabilities for color
recommendation, raising the question: Can pretrained LLMs serve as superior
designers for color recommendation tasks? To investigate this, we developed a
robust, rigorously validated pipeline, ColorGPT, that was built by
systematically testing multiple color representations and applying effective
prompt engineering techniques. Our approach primarily targeted color palette
completion by recommending colors based on a set of given colors and
accompanying context. Moreover, our method can be extended to full palette
generation, producing an entire color palette corresponding to a provided
textual description. Experimental results demonstrated that our LLM-based
pipeline outperformed existing methods in terms of color suggestion accuracy
and the distribution of colors in the color palette completion task. For the
full palette generation task, our approach also yielded improvements in color
diversity and similarity compared to current techniques.

TL;DR: KFFocus提出了一种高效压缩视频令牌并突出关键帧信息的方法，以解决当前视频LLMs在长视频序列中因均匀采样而忽略关键帧的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频LLMs在压缩长视频序列时采用均匀采样策略，可能导致关键帧信息丢失，影响视频理解的准确性。

Method: KFFocus通过基于时间冗余识别关键帧，并根据上下文相关性分配不同的压缩比率，同时引入时空建模模块捕捉帧间和帧内关系。

Result: 在长视频场景的广泛实验中，KFFocus显著优于现有方法，提高了计算效率和准确性。

Conclusion: KFFocus通过优化视频令牌压缩和时空建模，有效提升了视频LLMs的性能，尤其在长视频理解任务中表现突出。

Abstract: Recently, with the emergence of large language models, multimodal LLMs have
demonstrated exceptional capabilities in image and video modalities. Despite
advancements in video comprehension, the substantial computational demands of
long video sequences lead current video LLMs (Vid-LLMs) to employ compression
strategies at both the inter-frame level (e.g., uniform sampling of video
frames) and intra-frame level (e.g., condensing all visual tokens of each frame
into a limited number). However, this approach often neglects the uneven
temporal distribution of critical information across frames, risking the
omission of keyframes that contain essential temporal and semantic details. To
tackle these challenges, we propose KFFocus, a method designed to efficiently
compress video tokens and emphasize the informative context present within
video frames. We substitute uniform sampling with a refined approach inspired
by classic video compression principles to identify and capture keyframes based
on their temporal redundancy. By assigning varying condensation ratios to
frames based on their contextual relevance, KFFocus efficiently reduces token
redundancy while preserving informative content details. Additionally, we
introduce a spatiotemporal modeling module that encodes both the temporal
relationships between video frames and the spatial structure within each frame,
thus providing Vid-LLMs with a nuanced understanding of spatial-temporal
dynamics. Extensive experiments on widely recognized video understanding
benchmarks, especially long video scenarios, demonstrate that KFFocus
significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving substantial computational
efficiency and enhanced accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为MSQ的多尺度量化方法，用于解决现有运动表示在复杂模式建模和组合灵活性方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有运动表示通常为离散帧序列，无法从多尺度角度捕捉运动，且缺乏组合灵活性，限制了模型的泛化能力。

Method: MSQ通过多尺度离散化方法，在空间和时间维度上压缩运动序列，并使用不同编码器捕捉不同空间粒度的身体部位，再通过时间插值生成多尺度特征。

Result: MSQ支持无缝组合运动标记，无需专门设计或重新训练，且在多个基准测试中优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: MSQ方法在多尺度运动表示和生成任务中表现出色，为运动编辑、控制和条件生成提供了有效支持。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in human motion generation, current motion
representations, typically formulated as discrete frame sequences, still face
two critical limitations: (i) they fail to capture motion from a multi-scale
perspective, limiting the capability in complex patterns modeling; (ii) they
lack compositional flexibility, which is crucial for model's generalization in
diverse generation tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce MSQ, a
novel quantization method that compresses the motion sequence into multi-scale
discrete tokens across spatial and temporal dimensions. MSQ employs distinct
encoders to capture body parts at varying spatial granularities and temporally
interpolates the encoded features into multiple scales before quantizing them
into discrete tokens. Building on this representation, we establish a
generative mask modeling model to effectively support motion editing, motion
control, and conditional motion generation. Through quantitative and
qualitative analysis, we show that our quantization method enables the seamless
composition of motion tokens without requiring specialized design or
re-training. Furthermore, extensive evaluations demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing baseline methods on various benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统大核卷积网络参数和计算成本高，且会破坏ERF的AGD，因此需要一种更高效的方法扩展ERF。

Method: 通过组合小核（如7×7、9×9、11×11）扩展ERF并保持AGD，设计了Three-layer Receptive Field Aggregator和Layer Operator，构建UniConvNet。

Result: UniConvNet在ImageNet-1K、COCO2017和ADE20K上超越现有CNN和ViT，UniConvNet-T达到84.2%准确率，UniConvNet-XL达88.4%。

Conclusion: 组合小核扩展ERF并保持AGD是一种高效范式，UniConvNet在多种任务中表现优异且具有通用性。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) with large effective receptive field
(ERF), still in their early stages, have demonstrated promising effectiveness
while constrained by high parameters and FLOPs costs and disrupted
asymptotically Gaussian distribution (AGD) of ERF. This paper proposes an
alternative paradigm: rather than merely employing extremely large ERF, it is
more effective and efficient to expand the ERF while maintaining AGD of ERF by
proper combination of smaller kernels, such as $7\times{7}$, $9\times{9}$,
$11\times{11}$. This paper introduces a Three-layer Receptive Field Aggregator
and designs a Layer Operator as the fundamental operator from the perspective
of receptive field. The ERF can be expanded to the level of existing
large-kernel ConvNets through the stack of proposed modules while maintaining
AGD of ERF. Using these designs, we propose a universal model for ConvNet of
any scale, termed UniConvNet. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K, COCO2017,
and ADE20K demonstrate that UniConvNet outperforms state-of-the-art CNNs and
ViTs across various vision recognition tasks for both lightweight and
large-scale models with comparable throughput. Surprisingly, UniConvNet-T
achieves $84.2\%$ ImageNet top-1 accuracy with $30M$ parameters and $5.1G$
FLOPs. UniConvNet-XL also shows competitive scalability to big data and large
models, acquiring $88.4\%$ top-1 accuracy on ImageNet. Code and models are

*Luyang Cao,Han Xu,Jian Zhang,Lei Qi,Jiayi Ma,Yinghuan Shi,Yang Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的Inter-correction Retinex模型（IRetinex），通过减少分解和增强阶段的组件间残差（ICR），显著提升了低光图像增强的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Retinex方法在分解图像为光照和反射组件时存在残差（ICR），影响分解精度和最终图像质量。

Method: 在分解阶段引入组件间残差减少模块，在增强阶段利用组件间特征相似性检测和减轻ICR影响。

Result: 在三个低光基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法在定性和定量上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过减少ICR，IRetinex模型显著提升了低光图像增强的性能。

Abstract: In low-light image enhancement, Retinex-based deep learning methods have
garnered significant attention due to their exceptional interpretability. These
methods decompose images into mutually independent illumination and reflectance
components, allows each component to be enhanced separately. In fact, achieving
perfect decomposition of illumination and reflectance components proves to be
quite challenging, with some residuals still existing after decomposition. In
this paper, we formally name these residuals as inter-component residuals
(ICR), which has been largely underestimated by previous methods. In our
investigation, ICR not only affects the accuracy of the decomposition but also
causes enhanced components to deviate from the ideal outcome, ultimately
reducing the final synthesized image quality. To address this issue, we propose
a novel Inter-correction Retinex model (IRetinex) to alleviate ICR during the
decomposition and enhancement stage. In the decomposition stage, we leverage
inter-component residual reduction module to reduce the feature similarity
between illumination and reflectance components. In the enhancement stage, we
utilize the feature similarity between the two components to detect and
mitigate the impact of ICR within each enhancement unit. Extensive experiments
on three low-light benchmark datasets demonstrated that by reducing ICR, our
method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches both qualitatively and
quantitatively.

TL;DR: UC-Seg框架通过不确定性感知的交叉训练和伪标签生成，提升半监督医学图像分割的准确性和泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有半监督学习方法中模型认知偏差和高置信度伪标签生成的挑战。

Method: 提出UC-Seg框架，包含交叉子网一致性保持策略（CCP）和不确定性感知伪标签生成组件（UPG）。

Result: 在多种医学图像分割任务中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: UC-Seg有效提升了半监督医学图像分割的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning has gained considerable popularity in medical image
segmentation tasks due to its capability to reduce reliance on expert-examined
annotations. Several mean-teacher (MT) based semi-supervised methods utilize
consistency regularization to effectively leverage valuable information from
unlabeled data. However, these methods often heavily rely on the student model
and overlook the potential impact of cognitive biases within the model.
Furthermore, some methods employ co-training using pseudo-labels derived from
different inputs, yet generating high-confidence pseudo-labels from perturbed
inputs during training remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we
propose an Uncertainty-aware Cross-training framework for semi-supervised
medical image Segmentation (UC-Seg). Our UC-Seg framework incorporates two
distinct subnets to effectively explore and leverage the correlation between
them, thereby mitigating cognitive biases within the model. Specifically, we
present a Cross-subnet Consistency Preservation (CCP) strategy to enhance
feature representation capability and ensure feature consistency across the two
subnets. This strategy enables each subnet to correct its own biases and learn
shared semantics from both labeled and unlabeled data. Additionally, we propose
an Uncertainty-aware Pseudo-label Generation (UPG) component that leverages
segmentation results and corresponding uncertainty maps from both subnets to
generate high-confidence pseudo-labels. We extensively evaluate the proposed
UC-Seg on various medical image segmentation tasks involving different modality
images, such as MRI, CT, ultrasound, colonoscopy, and so on. The results
demonstrate that our method achieves superior segmentation accuracy and
generalization performance compared to other state-of-the-art semi-supervised
methods. Our code will be released at https://github.com/taozh2017/UCSeg.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI生成内容越来越逼真，人工标注变得耗时且不可靠，需要一种能有效利用大规模未标记数据的方法。

Method: DPGNet包含两个核心模块：文本引导的跨域对齐和课程驱动的伪标签生成，并通过跨域知识蒸馏防止灾难性遗忘。

Result: 在11个流行数据集上的实验表明，DPGNet优于现有方法6.3%。

Conclusion: DPGNet通过利用未标记数据，成功解决了深度伪造检测中因内容逼真化带来的标注难题。

Abstract: Existing deepfake detection methods heavily depend on labeled training data.
However, as AI-generated content becomes increasingly realistic, even
\textbf{human annotators struggle to distinguish} between deepfakes and
authentic images. This makes the labeling process both time-consuming and less
reliable. Specifically, there is a growing demand for approaches that can
effectively utilize large-scale unlabeled data from online social networks.
Unlike typical unsupervised learning tasks, where categories are distinct,
AI-generated faces closely mimic real image distributions and share strong
similarities, causing performance drop in conventional strategies. In this
paper, we introduce the Dual-Path Guidance Network (DPGNet), to tackle two key
challenges: (1) bridging the domain gap between faces from different generation
models, and (2) utilizing unlabeled image samples. The method features two core
modules: text-guided cross-domain alignment, which uses learnable prompts to
unify visual and textual embeddings into a domain-invariant feature space, and
curriculum-driven pseudo label generation, which dynamically exploit more
informative unlabeled samples. To prevent catastrophic forgetting, we also
facilitate bridging between domains via cross-domain knowledge distillation.
Extensive experiments on \textbf{11 popular datasets}, show that DPGNet
outperforms SoTA approaches by \textbf{6.3\%}, highlighting its effectiveness
in leveraging unlabeled data to address the annotation challenges posed by the
increasing realism of deepfakes.

Result: 在六种个性化方法和多种基础模型上验证，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了文本到图像个性化的效果，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Visual concept learning, also known as Text-to-image personalization, is the
process of teaching new concepts to a pretrained model. This has numerous
applications from product placement to entertainment and personalized design.
Here we show that many existing methods can be substantially augmented by
adding a personalization step that is (1) specific to the prompt and noise
seed, and (2) using two loss terms based on the self- and cross- attention,
capturing the identity of the personalized concept. Specifically, we leverage
PDM features -- previously designed to capture identity -- and show how they
can be used to improve personalized semantic similarity. We evaluate the
benefit that our method gains on top of six different personalization methods,
and several base text-to-image models (both UNet- and DiT-based). We find
significant improvements even over previous per-query personalization methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于主动学习的视频异常检测框架，通过动态选择数据标注和人类参与机制，适应动态环境中的异常检测需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频异常检测在动态环境中面临挑战，传统静态评估指标难以适应变化。

Method: 采用主动学习框架，结合人类参与机制，动态调整阈值以适应不同环境。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法在模拟真实场景中达到68.91的EBI（Q3），验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了视频异常检测在动态环境中的适用性。

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) can play a key role in spotting unusual
activities in video footage. VAD is difficult to use in real-world settings due
to the dynamic nature of human actions, environmental variations, and domain
shifts. Traditional evaluation metrics often prove inadequate for such
scenarios, as they rely on static assumptions and fall short of identifying a
threshold that distinguishes normal from anomalous behavior in dynamic
settings. To address this, we introduce an active learning framework tailored
for VAD, designed for adapting to the ever-changing real-world conditions. Our
approach leverages active learning to continuously select the most informative
data points for labeling, thereby enhancing model adaptability. A critical
innovation is the incorporation of a human-in-the-loop mechanism, which enables
the identification of actual normal and anomalous instances from
pseudo-labeling results generated by AI. This collected data allows the
framework to define an adaptive threshold tailored to different environments,
ensuring that the system remains effective as the definition of 'normal' shifts
across various settings. Implemented within a lab-based framework that
simulates real-world conditions, our approach allows rigorous testing and
refinement of VAD algorithms with a new metric. Experimental results show that
our method achieves an EBI (Error Balance Index) of 68.91 for Q3 in real-world
simulated scenarios, demonstrating its practical effectiveness and
significantly enhancing the applicability of VAD in dynamic environments.

Motivation: 解决自动驾驶系统中开放集感知的挑战，特别是识别未见过的物体类别，以确保安全性。

Method: 提出VLM-3D框架，结合LoRA高效适应VLMs，并设计联合语义-几何损失（早期使用语义损失，后期引入3D IoU损失）。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，感知精度提升了12.8%。

Conclusion: VLM-3D通过端到端设计和联合损失，有效提升了自动驾驶场景中的3D感知能力。

Abstract: Open-set perception in complex traffic environments poses a critical
challenge for autonomous driving systems, particularly in identifying
previously unseen object categories, which is vital for ensuring safety. Visual
Language Models (VLMs), with their rich world knowledge and strong semantic
reasoning capabilities, offer new possibilities for addressing this task.
However, existing approaches typically leverage VLMs to extract visual features
and couple them with traditional object detectors, resulting in multi-stage
error propagation that hinders perception accuracy. To overcome this
limitation, we propose VLM-3D, the first end-to-end framework that enables VLMs
to perform 3D geometric perception in autonomous driving scenarios. VLM-3D
incorporates Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to efficiently adapt VLMs to driving
tasks with minimal computational overhead, and introduces a joint
semantic-geometric loss design: token-level semantic loss is applied during
early training to ensure stable convergence, while 3D IoU loss is introduced in
later stages to refine the accuracy of 3D bounding box predictions. Evaluations
on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that the proposed joint semantic-geometric
loss in VLM-3D leads to a 12.8% improvement in perception accuracy, fully
validating the effectiveness and advancement of our method.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) highlight a strong connection
between intelligence and compression. Learned image compression, a fundamental
task in modern data compression, has made significant progress in recent years.
However, current models remain limited in scale, restricting their
representation capacity, and how scaling model size influences compression
performance remains unexplored. In this work, we present a pioneering study on
scaling up learned image compression models and revealing the performance
trends through scaling laws. Using the recent state-of-the-art HPCM model as
baseline, we scale model parameters from 68.5 millions to 1 billion and fit
power-law relations between test loss and key scaling variables, including
model size and optimal training compute. The results reveal a scaling trend,
enabling extrapolation to larger scale models. Experimental results demonstrate
that the scaled-up HPCM-1B model achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion
performance. We hope this work inspires future exploration of large-scale
compression models and deeper investigations into the connection between
compression and intelligence.

Conclusion: 提出的无监督去偏方法有效减少了群体差异，适用于医疗领域公平性需求。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success on multimodal
tasks such as image-text retrieval and zero-shot classification, yet they can
exhibit demographic biases even when explicit protected attributes are absent
during training. In this work, we focus on automated glaucoma screening from
retinal fundus images, a critical application given that glaucoma is a leading
cause of irreversible blindness and disproportionately affects underserved
populations. Building on a reweighting-based contrastive learning framework, we
introduce an attribute-agnostic debiasing method that (i) infers proxy
subgroups via unsupervised clustering of image-image embeddings, (ii) computes
gradient-similarity weights between the CLIP-style multimodal loss and a
SimCLR-style image-pair contrastive loss, and (iii) applies these weights in a
joint, top-$k$ weighted objective to upweight underperforming clusters. This
label-free approach adaptively targets the hardest examples, thereby reducing
subgroup disparities. We evaluate our method on the Harvard FairVLMed glaucoma
subset, reporting Equalized Odds Distance (EOD), Equalized Subgroup AUC (ES
AUC), and Groupwise AUC to demonstrate equitable performance across inferred
demographic subgroups.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of digital security, biometric
authentication systems, particularly facial recognition, have emerged as
integral components of various security protocols. However, the reliability of
these systems is compromised by sophisticated spoofing attacks, where imposters
gain unauthorized access by falsifying biometric traits. Current literature
reveals a concerning gap: existing liveness detection methodologies - designed

employing deepfakes and other artificial intelligence-driven manipulations.
This study introduces a robust solution through novel deep learning models
addressing the deficiencies in contemporary anti-spoofing techniques. By
innovatively integrating texture analysis and reflective properties associated
with genuine human traits, our models distinguish authentic presence from
replicas with remarkable precision. Extensive evaluations were conducted across
five diverse datasets, encompassing a wide range of attack vectors and
environmental conditions. Results demonstrate substantial advancement over
existing systems, with our best model (AttackNet V2.2) achieving 99.9% average
accuracy when trained on combined data. Moreover, our research unveils critical
insights into the behavioral patterns of impostor attacks, contributing to a
more nuanced understanding of their evolving nature. The implications are
profound: our models do not merely fortify the authentication processes but
also instill confidence in biometric systems across various sectors reliant on
secure access.

Conclusion: Turbo-VAED首次实现移动设备上实时720p视频VAE解码，适用于大多数视频VAE，具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: There is a growing demand for deploying large generative AI models on mobile
devices. For recent popular video generative models, however, the Variational
AutoEncoder (VAE) represents one of the major computational bottlenecks. Both
large parameter sizes and mismatched kernels cause out-of-memory errors or
extremely slow inference on mobile devices. To address this, we propose a
low-cost solution that efficiently transfers widely used video VAEs to mobile
devices. (1) We analyze redundancy in existing VAE architectures and get
empirical design insights. By integrating 3D depthwise separable convolutions
into our model, we significantly reduce the number of parameters. (2) We
observe that the upsampling techniques in mainstream video VAEs are poorly
suited to mobile hardware and form the main bottleneck. In response, we propose
a decoupled 3D pixel shuffle scheme that slashes end-to-end delay. Building
upon these, we develop a universal mobile-oriented VAE decoder, Turbo-VAED. (3)
We propose an efficient VAE decoder training method. Since only the decoder is
used during deployment, we distill it to Turbo-VAED instead of retraining the
full VAE, enabling fast mobile adaptation with minimal performance loss. To our
knowledge, our method enables real-time 720p video VAE decoding on mobile
devices for the first time. This approach is widely applicable to most video
VAEs. When integrated into four representative models, with training cost as
low as $95, it accelerates original VAEs by up to 84.5x at 720p resolution on
GPUs, uses as low as 17.5% of original parameter count, and retains 96.9% of
the original reconstruction quality. Compared to mobile-optimized VAEs,
Turbo-VAED achieves a 2.9x speedup in FPS and better reconstruction quality on
the iPhone 16 Pro. The code and models will soon be available at
https://github.com/hustvl/Turbo-VAED.

Motivation: 由于缺乏公开的高质量全身人体捕捉数据集，限制了人体重光照和新视角渲染领域的研究进展。

Method: 通过构建HumanOLAT数据集，包含多种光照条件下的高动态范围（HDR）RGB帧，如白光、环境光、颜色渐变和精细OLAT光照。

Result: 评估表明，现有重光照和新视角合成方法仍面临复杂人体外观与光照交互建模的挑战。

Conclusion: HumanOLAT数据集将为未来研究提供重要支持，推动人体重光照和渲染技术的进步。

Abstract: Simultaneous relighting and novel-view rendering of digital human
representations is an important yet challenging task with numerous
applications. Progress in this area has been significantly limited due to the
lack of publicly available, high-quality datasets, especially for full-body
human captures. To address this critical gap, we introduce the HumanOLAT
dataset, the first publicly accessible large-scale dataset of multi-view
One-Light-at-a-Time (OLAT) captures of full-body humans. The dataset includes
HDR RGB frames under various illuminations, such as white light, environment
maps, color gradients and fine-grained OLAT illuminations. Our evaluations of
state-of-the-art relighting and novel-view synthesis methods underscore both
the dataset's value and the significant challenges still present in modeling
complex human-centric appearance and lighting interactions. We believe
HumanOLAT will significantly facilitate future research, enabling rigorous
benchmarking and advancements in both general and human-specific relighting and
rendering techniques.

TL;DR: 研究评估了大型语言模型（LLM）将弗吉尼亚州17-18世纪土地专利描述转换为地理坐标的能力，发现某些模型表现优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史土地专利的描述形式限制了空间分析，需高效方法将其转换为地理坐标。

Method: 使用6种OpenAI模型，比较直接转换和工具增强链式思维两种范式，并与传统方法对比。

Result: 最佳模型平均误差23公里，优于传统方法；成本效益高的模型表现稳定。

Conclusion: LLM在历史地理定位中具有可扩展性、准确性和成本效益。

Abstract: Virginia's seventeenth- and eighteenth-century land patents survive primarily
as narrative metes-and-bounds descriptions, limiting spatial analysis. This
study systematically evaluates current-generation large language models (LLMs)
in converting these prose abstracts into geographically accurate
latitude/longitude coordinates within a focused evaluation context. A digitized
corpus of 5,471 Virginia patent abstracts (1695-1732) is released, with 43
rigorously verified test cases serving as an initial, geographically focused
benchmark. Six OpenAI models across three architectures (o-series, GPT-4-class,
and GPT-3.5) were tested under two paradigms: direct-to-coordinate and
tool-augmented chain-of-thought invoking external geocoding APIs. Results were
compared with a GIS-analyst baseline, the Stanford NER geoparser, Mordecai-3,
and a county-centroid heuristic.
  The top single-call model, o3-2025-04-16, achieved a mean error of 23 km
(median 14 km), outperforming the median LLM (37.4 km) by 37.5%, the weakest
LLM (50.3 km) by 53.5%, and external baselines by 67% (GIS analyst) and 70%
(Stanford NER). A five-call ensemble further reduced errors to 19 km (median 12
km) at minimal additional cost (approx. USD 0.20 per grant), outperforming the
median LLM by 48.6%. A patentee-name-redaction ablation increased error by
about 9%, indicating reliance on textual landmark and adjacency descriptions
rather than memorization. The cost-efficient gpt-4o-2024-08-06 model maintained
a 28 km mean error at USD 1.09 per 1,000 grants, establishing a strong
cost-accuracy benchmark; external geocoding tools offered no measurable benefit
in this evaluation.
  These findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs for scalable, accurate, and
cost-effective historical georeferencing.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have demonstrated significant potential in
providing innovative solutions for various biomedical tasks, including
pathology analysis, radiology report generation, and biomedical assistance.
However, the existing multimodal biomedical AI is typically based on foundation
LLMs, thus hindering the understanding of intricate medical concepts with
limited medical training data. Moreover, recent LLaVA-induced medical LMMs
struggle to effectively capture the intricate relationship between the texts
and the images. Therefore, we introduce Doctor Sun, a large multimodal
generative model specialized in medicine, developed to encode, integrate, and
interpret diverse biomedical data modalities such as text and images. In
particular, Doctor Sun integrates a pre-trained vision encoder with a medical
LLM and conducts two-stage training on various medical datasets, focusing on
feature alignment and instruction tuning. Moreover, we release SunMed-VL, a
wide-range bilingual medical multimodal dataset, along with all associated
models, code, and resources, to freely support the advancement of biomedical
multimodal research.

Motivation: 边缘计算系统中的分散式联邦学习（DFL）面临通信瓶颈、动态拓扑变化、资源异构性和数据异构性等挑战，亟需一种高效的框架来优化模型性能和能耗。

Result: Hat-DFed在复杂边缘环境中能最大化模型性能并最小化累积能耗，同时缓解数据异构性导致的性能下降。

Conclusion: Hat-DFed为边缘计算系统中的分散式联邦学习提供了一种高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm within edge
computing (EC) systems, enabling numerous edge devices to collaboratively train
artificial intelligence (AI) models while maintaining data privacy. To overcome
the communication bottlenecks associated with centralized parameter servers,
decentralized federated learning (DFL), which leverages peer-to-peer (P2P)
communication, has been extensively explored in the research community.
Although researchers design a variety of DFL approach to ensure model
convergence, its iterative learning process inevitably incurs considerable cost
along with the growth of model complexity and the number of participants. These
costs are largely influenced by the dynamic changes of topology in each
training round, particularly its sparsity and connectivity conditions.
Furthermore, the inherent resources heterogeneity in the edge environments
affects energy efficiency of learning process, while data heterogeneity
degrades model performance. These factors pose significant challenges to the
design of an effective DFL framework for EC systems. To this end, we propose
Hat-DFed, a heterogeneity-aware and coset-effective decentralized federated
learning (DFL) framework. In Hat-DFed, the topology construction is formulated
as a dual optimization problem, which is then proven to be NP-hard, with the
goal of maximizing model performance while minimizing cumulative energy
consumption in complex edge environments. To solve this problem, we design a
two-phase algorithm that dynamically constructs optimal communication
topologies while unbiasedly estimating their impact on both model performance
and energy cost. Additionally, the algorithm incorporates an importance-aware
model aggregation mechanism to mitigate performance degradation caused by data
heterogeneity.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水质预测因复杂的周期性、非平稳性和生态因素引起的突变波动而具有挑战性，多站点场景进一步增加了时空动态建模的难度。

Method: XFMNet通过自适应降采样对齐时间分辨率，局部自适应分解趋势和周期成分，并利用交叉注意力门控融合模块动态整合时空模式与生态线索。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验表明，XFMNet显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: XFMNet有效提升了时空分布时间序列预测的准确性。

Abstract: Long-term time-series forecasting is critical for environmental monitoring,
yet water quality prediction remains challenging due to complex periodicity,
nonstationarity, and abrupt fluctuations induced by ecological factors. These
challenges are further amplified in multi-site scenarios that require
simultaneous modeling of temporal and spatial dynamics. To tackle this, we
introduce XFMNet, a stepwise multimodal fusion network that integrates remote
sensing precipitation imagery to provide spatial and environmental context in
river networks. XFMNet first aligns temporal resolutions between water quality
series and remote sensing inputs via adaptive downsampling, followed by locally
adaptive decomposition to disentangle trend and cycle components. A
cross-attention gated fusion module dynamically integrates temporal patterns
with spatial and ecological cues, enhancing robustness to nonstationarity and
site-specific anomalies. Through progressive and recursive fusion, XFMNet
captures both long-term trends and short-term fluctuations. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate substantial improvements over
state-of-the-art baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of XFMNet for
spatially distributed time series prediction.

Result: 在六个数据集上实现了最先进的性能，并通过消融研究验证了各模块的有效性。

Conclusion: MoSSDA通过两阶段学习和对比模块显著提升了域自适应性能，适用于时间序列分类。

Abstract: Deep learning has emerged as the most promising approach in various fields;
however, when the distributions of training and test data are different (domain
shift), the performance of deep learning models can degrade. Semi-supervised
domain adaptation (SSDA) is a major approach for addressing this issue,
assuming that a fully labeled training set (source domain) is available, but
the test set (target domain) provides labels only for a small subset. In this
study, we propose a novel two-step momentum encoder-utilized SSDA framework,
MoSSDA, for multivariate time-series classification. Time series data are
highly sensitive to noise, and sequential dependencies cause domain shifts
resulting in critical performance degradation. To obtain a robust,
domain-invariant and class-discriminative representation, MoSSDA employs a
domain-invariant encoder to learn features from both source and target domains.
Subsequently, the learned features are fed to a mixup-enhanced positive
contrastive module consisting of an online momentum encoder. The final
classifier is trained with learned features that exhibit consistency and
discriminability with limited labeled target domain data, without data
augmentation. We applied a two-stage process by separating the gradient flow
between the encoders and the classifier to obtain rich and complex
representations. Through extensive experiments on six diverse datasets, MoSSDA
achieved state-of-the-art performance for three different backbones and various
unlabeled ratios in the target domain data. The Ablation study confirms that
each module, including two-stage learning, is effective in improving the
performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/seonyoungKimm/MoSSDA

Conclusion: MGSTC方法在连续预测场景中实现了高精度，适用于实际电信流量预测需求。

Abstract: Knowledge discovered from telecom data can facilitate proactive understanding
of network dynamics and user behaviors, which in turn empowers service
providers to optimize cellular traffic scheduling and resource allocation.
Nevertheless, the telecom industry still heavily relies on manual expert
intervention. Existing studies have been focused on exhaustively explore the
spatial-temporal correlations. However, they often overlook the underlying
characteristics of cellular traffic, which are shaped by the sporadic and
bursty nature of telecom services. Additionally, concept drift creates
substantial obstacles to maintaining satisfactory accuracy in continuous
cellular forecasting tasks. To resolve these problems, we put forward an online
cellular traffic prediction method grounded in Multi-Grained Spatial-Temporal
feature Complementarity (MGSTC). The proposed method is devised to achieve
high-precision predictions in practical continuous forecasting scenarios.
Concretely, MGSTC segments historical data into chunks and employs the
coarse-grained temporal attention to offer a trend reference for the prediction
horizon. Subsequently, fine-grained spatial attention is utilized to capture
detailed correlations among network elements, which enables localized
refinement of the established trend. The complementarity of these multi-grained
spatial-temporal features facilitates the efficient transmission of valuable
information. To accommodate continuous forecasting needs, we implement an
online learning strategy that can detect concept drift in real-time and
promptly switch to the appropriate parameter update stage. Experiments carried
out on four real-world datasets demonstrate that MGSTC outperforms eleven
state-of-the-art baselines consistently.

Conclusion: 论文结论认为现代AI的成功不仅源于架构创新，还因其实现了生物学优化的计算原理。

Abstract: Transformer architectures have revolutionized artificial intelligence (AI)
through their attention mechanisms, yet the computational principles underlying
their success remain opaque. We present a novel theoretical framework that
reinterprets the core computation of attention as Pavlovian conditioning. Our
model finds a direct mathematical analogue in linear attention, which
simplifies the analysis of the underlying associative process. We demonstrate
that attention's queries, keys, and values can be mapped to the three elements
of classical conditioning: test stimuli that probe associations, conditional
stimuli (CS) that serve as retrieval cues, and unconditional stimuli (US) that
contain response information. Through this lens, we suggest that each attention
operation constructs a transient associative memory via a Hebbian rule, where
CS-US pairs form dynamic associations that test stimuli can later retrieve. Our
framework yields several theoretical insights grounded in this linearized
model: (1) a capacity theorem showing that attention heads can store
O($\sqrt{d_k}$) associations before interference degrades retrieval; (2) an
error propagation analysis revealing fundamental architectural trade-offs of
balancing model depth, width, and head redundancy to maintain reliability; and
(3) an understanding of how biologically plausible learning rules could enhance
transformer architectures. By establishing this deep connection, we suggest
that the success of modern AI may stem not from architectural novelty alone,
but from implementing computational principles that biology optimized over
millions of years of evolution.

Abstract: Recent research has proven neural networks to be a powerful tool for
performing hyperspectral imaging (HSI) target identification. However, many
deep learning frameworks deliver a single material class prediction and operate
on a per-pixel basis; such approaches are limited in their interpretability and
restricted to predicting materials that are accessible in available training
libraries. In this work, we present an inverse modeling approach in the form of
a physics-conditioned generative model.A probabilistic latent-variable model
learns the underlying distribution of HSI radiance measurements and produces
the conditional distribution of the emissivity spectrum. Moreover, estimates of
the HSI scene's atmosphere and background are used as a physically relevant
conditioning mechanism to contextualize a given radiance measurement during the
encoding and decoding processes. Furthermore, we employ an in-the-loop
augmentation scheme and physics-based loss criteria to avoid bias towards a
predefined training material set and to encourage the model to learn physically
consistent inverse mappings. Monte-Carlo sampling of the model's conditioned
posterior delivers a sought emissivity distribution and allows for
interpretable uncertainty quantification. Moreover, a distribution-based
material matching scheme is presented to return a set of likely material
matches for an inferred emissivity distribution. Hence, we present a strategy
to incorporate contextual information about a given HSI scene, capture the
possible variation of underlying material spectra, and provide interpretable
probability measures of a candidate material accounting for given
remotely-sensed radiance measurement.

Abstract: We investigate the impact of channel-wise mixing via multi-layer perceptrons

Specifically, we compare two architectures: DARC (Depth Aware Recurrent
Convolution), which employs a simple recurrent convolutional structure, and
DAMP (Depth Aware Multi-layer Perceptron), which extends DARC with a gated MLP
for channel mixing. Using the Re-ARC benchmark, we find that DAMP significantly
outperforms DARC in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution generalization
under exact-match grading criteria. These results suggest that explicit channel
mixing through MLPs enables recurrent convolutional networks to learn more
robust and generalizable computational patterns. Our findings have implications
for neural program synthesis and highlight the potential of DAMP as a target
architecture for hypernetwork approaches.

Abstract: During the last decade, a large number of different numerical methods have
been proposed to tackle the automatic identification and quantification in
{\gamma}-ray spectrometry. However, the lack of common benchmarks, including
datasets, code and comparison metrics, makes their evaluation and comparison
hard. In that context, we propose an open-source benchmark that comprises
simulated datasets of various {\gamma}-spectrometry settings, codes of
different analysis approaches and evaluation metrics. This allows us to compare
the state-of-the-art end-to-end machine learning with a statistical unmixing
approach using the full spectrum. Three scenarios have been investigated: (1)
spectral signatures are assumed to be known; (2) spectral signatures are
deformed due to physical phenomena such as Compton scattering and attenuation;
and (3) spectral signatures are shifted (e.g., due to temperature variation). A
large dataset of 200000 simulated spectra containing nine radionuclides with an
experimental natural background is used for each scenario with multiple
radionuclides present in the spectrum. Regarding identification performance,
the statistical approach consistently outperforms the machine learning
approaches across all three scenarios for all comparison metrics. However, the
performance of the statistical approach can be significantly impacted when
spectral signatures are not modeled correctly. Consequently, the full-spectrum
statistical approach is most effective with known or well-modeled spectral
signatures, while end-to-end machine learning is a good alternative when
measurement conditions are uncertain for radionuclide identification.
Concerning the quantification task, the statistical approach provides accurate
estimates of radionuclide counting, while the machine learning methods deliver
less satisfactory results.

Conclusion: HSA-Net通过分层和结构感知设计，有效解决了全局-局部权衡问题，提升了分子表示学习性能。

Abstract: Molecular representation learning, a cornerstone for downstream tasks like
molecular captioning and molecular property prediction, heavily relies on Graph
Neural Networks (GNN). However, GNN suffers from the over-smoothing problem,
where node-level features collapse in deep GNN layers. While existing feature
projection methods with cross-attention have been introduced to mitigate this
issue, they still perform poorly in deep features. This motivated our
exploration of using Mamba as an alternative projector for its ability to
handle complex sequences. However, we observe that while Mamba excels at
preserving global topological information from deep layers, it neglects
fine-grained details in shallow layers. The capabilities of Mamba and
cross-attention exhibit a global-local trade-off. To resolve this critical
global-local trade-off, we propose Hierarchical and Structure-Aware Network
(HSA-Net), a novel framework with two modules that enables a hierarchical
feature projection and fusion. Firstly, a Hierarchical Adaptive Projector (HAP)
module is introduced to process features from different graph layers. It learns
to dynamically switch between a cross-attention projector for shallow layers
and a structure-aware Graph-Mamba projector for deep layers, producing
high-quality, multi-level features. Secondly, to adaptively merge these
multi-level features, we design a Source-Aware Fusion (SAF) module, which
flexibly selects fusion experts based on the characteristics of the aggregation
features, ensuring a precise and effective final representation fusion.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our HSA-Net framework quantitatively and
qualitatively outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦学习中的计算异构性、资源受限设备负担、高通信成本和复杂模型聚合问题。

Method: 提出SHeRL-FL，整合分割学习和分层模型聚合，引入中间层表示学习，减少云端依赖。

Result: 实验表明，SHeRL-FL在图像分类和分割任务中，数据传输减少90%以上，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SHeRL-FL有效降低了通信和协调成本，提升了联邦学习的可扩展性和效率。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a promising approach for addressing scalability
and latency issues in large-scale networks by enabling collaborative model
training without requiring the sharing of raw data. However, existing FL
frameworks often overlook the computational heterogeneity of edge clients and
the growing training burden on resource-limited devices. However, FL suffers
from high communication costs and complex model aggregation, especially with
large models. Previous works combine split learning (SL) and hierarchical FL
(HierFL) to reduce device-side computation and improve scalability, but this
introduces training complexity due to coordination across tiers. To address
these issues, we propose SHeRL-FL, which integrates SL and hierarchical model
aggregation and incorporates representation learning at intermediate layers. By
allowing clients and edge servers to compute training objectives independently
of the cloud, SHeRL-FL significantly reduces both coordination complexity and
communication overhead. To evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of
SHeRL-FL, we performed experiments on image classification tasks using
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and HAM10000 with AlexNet, ResNet-18, and ResNet-50 in
both IID and non-IID settings. In addition, we evaluate performance on image
segmentation tasks using the ISIC-2018 dataset with a ResNet-50-based U-Net.
Experimental results demonstrate that SHeRL-FL reduces data transmission by
over 90\% compared to centralized FL and HierFL, and by 50\% compared to
SplitFed, which is a hybrid of FL and SL, and further improves hierarchical
split learning methods.

### [190] [Fuzzy-Pattern Tsetlin Machine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08350)
*Artem Hnilov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fuzzy-Pattern Tsetlin Machine (FPTM) introduces fuzzy clause evaluation, reducing clauses and memory while improving accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Tsetlin Machines require thousands of clauses due to strict 'all-or-nothing' evaluation, limiting efficiency and flexibility.

Method: FPTM replaces strict clause evaluation with fuzzy scoring, allowing partial contributions from clauses even if some literals fail.

Result: FPTM achieves higher accuracy with fewer clauses, faster training, and smaller memory footprint, outperforming other models on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: FPTM offers a more efficient and flexible alternative to traditional Tsetlin Machines, enabling practical applications like online learning on microcontrollers.

Abstract: The "all-or-nothing" clause evaluation strategy is a core mechanism in the
Tsetlin Machine (TM) family of algorithms. In this approach, each clause - a
logical pattern composed of binary literals mapped to input data - is
disqualified from voting if even a single literal fails. Due to this strict
requirement, standard TMs must employ thousands of clauses to achieve
competitive accuracy. This paper introduces the Fuzzy-Pattern Tsetlin Machine
(FPTM), a novel variant where clause evaluation is fuzzy rather than strict. If
some literals in a clause fail, the remaining ones can still contribute to the
overall vote with a proportionally reduced score. As a result, each clause
effectively consists of sub-patterns that adapt individually to the input,
enabling more flexible, efficient, and robust pattern matching. The proposed
fuzzy mechanism significantly reduces the required number of clauses, memory
footprint, and training time, while simultaneously improving accuracy. On the
IMDb dataset, FPTM achieves 90.15% accuracy with only one clause per class, a
50x reduction in clauses and memory over the Coalesced Tsetlin Machine. FPTM
trains up to 316x faster (45 seconds vs. 4 hours) and fits within 50 KB,
enabling online learning on microcontrollers. Inference throughput reaches 34.5
million predictions/second (51.4 GB/s). On Fashion-MNIST, accuracy reaches
92.18% (2 clauses), 93.19% (20 clauses) and 94.68% (8000 clauses), a ~400x
clause reduction compared to the Composite TM's 93.00% (8000 clauses). On the
Amazon Sales dataset with 20% noise, FPTM achieves 85.22% accuracy,
significantly outperforming the Graph Tsetlin Machine (78.17%) and a Graph
Convolutional Neural Network (66.23%).

TL;DR: 本文从第一性原理出发，为缩放点积注意力（SDPA）机制提供了理论依据，揭示了其前向传播和后向传播的数学本质。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SDPA是现代深度学习的核心组件，但其数学形式通常基于启发式。本文旨在从理论上证明其合理性。

Method: 将SDPA的前向传播建模为一个退化的单边熵最优传输（EOT）问题，并证明后向传播的梯度与基于优势的策略梯度数学等价。

Result: 揭示了SDPA前向传播的最优推断性质和后向传播的流形感知学习更新机制。

Conclusion: SDPA是一个基于优化问题的原理性机制，前向传播实现最优推断，后向传播实现合理的流形感知学习。

Abstract: The scaled-dot-product attention (SDPA) mechanism is a core component of
modern deep learning, but its mathematical form is often motivated by
heuristics. This work provides a first-principles justification for SDPA. We
first show that the attention forward pass is the exact solution to a
degenerate, one-sided Entropic Optimal Transport (EOT) problem, which seeks a
distribution that maximizes similarity while being maximally entropic. This
optimization perspective has a direct consequence for the backward pass. We
prove that the standard gradient computed via backpropagation is mathematically
identical to an advantage-based policy gradient, a variance-reduced update rule
from reinforcement learning. Crucially, we demonstrate that the EOT formulation
of the forward pass induces a specific information geometry on the space of
attention distributions. It is this geometry, characterized by the Fisher
Information Matrix, that dictates the precise form of the learning gradient,
revealing the advantage-based update as a natural consequence of the
optimization problem being solved. This unified view reveals SDPA as a
principled mechanism where the forward pass performs optimal inference and the
backward pass implements a rational, manifold-aware learning update.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We consider the problem of online regret minimization in linear bandits with
access to prior observations (offline data) from the underlying bandit model.
There are numerous applications where extensive offline data is often
available, such as in recommendation systems, online advertising. Consequently,
this problem has been studied intensively in recent literature. Our algorithm,
Offline-Online Phased Elimination (OOPE), effectively incorporates the offline
data to substantially reduce the online regret compared to prior work. To
leverage offline information prudently, OOPE uses an extended D-optimal design
within each exploration phase. OOPE achieves an online regret is
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\deff T \log \left(|\mathcal{A}|T\right)}+d^2)$. $\deff \leq
d)$ is the effective problem dimension which measures the number of poorly
explored directions in offline data and depends on the eigen-spectrum
$(\lambda_k)_{k \in [d]}$ of the Gram matrix of the offline data. The
eigen-spectrum $(\lambda_k)_{k \in [d]}$ is a quantitative measure of the
\emph{quality} of offline data. If the offline data is poorly explored ($\deff
\approx d$), we recover the established regret bounds for purely online setting
while, when offline data is abundant ($\Toff >> T$) and well-explored ($\deff =
o(1) $), the online regret reduces substantially. Additionally, we provide the
first known minimax regret lower bounds in this setting that depend explicitly
on the quality of the offline data. These lower bounds establish the optimality
of our algorithm in regimes where offline data is either well-explored or
poorly explored. Finally, by using a Frank-Wolfe approximation to the extended
optimal design we further improve the $O(d^{2})$ term to
$O\left(\frac{d^{2}}{\deff} \min \{ \deff,1\} \right)$, which can be
substantial in high dimensions with moderate quality of offline data $\deff =
\Omega(1)$.

Conclusion: FWPs为人工与自然智能的融合提供了新视角，突显了其在机器学习和神经科学中的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in artificial neural networks for machine learning, and
language modeling in particular, have established a family of recurrent neural
network (RNN) architectures that, unlike conventional RNNs with vector-form
hidden states, use two-dimensional (2D) matrix-form hidden states. Such
2D-state RNNs, known as Fast Weight Programmers (FWPs), can be interpreted as a
neural network whose synaptic weights (called fast weights) dynamically change
over time as a function of input observations, and serve as short-term memory
storage; corresponding synaptic weight modifications are controlled or
programmed by another network (the programmer) whose parameters are trained
(e.g., by gradient descent). In this Primer, we review the technical
foundations of FWPs, their computational characteristics, and their connections
to transformers and state space models. We also discuss connections between
FWPs and models of synaptic plasticity in the brain, suggesting a convergence
of natural and artificial intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界系统（如生物网络）常违反传统因果发现算法的假设（所有变量可观测且因果图为无环），现有方法在非线性或可扩展性上表现不佳。

Method: 提出DCCD-CONF框架，通过交替优化图结构和估计混杂因素分布，最大化数据对数似然。

Result: 在合成数据和真实基因扰动数据集上，DCCD-CONF在因果图恢复和混杂因素识别上优于现有方法，并提供一致性保证。

Conclusion: DCCD-CONF为解决非线性循环因果图中的混杂问题提供了有效且理论可靠的方法。

Abstract: Understanding causal relationships between variables is fundamental across
scientific disciplines. Most causal discovery algorithms rely on two key
assumptions: (i) all variables are observed, and (ii) the underlying causal
graph is acyclic. While these assumptions simplify theoretical analysis, they
are often violated in real-world systems, such as biological networks. Existing
methods that account for confounders either assume linearity or struggle with
scalability. To address these limitations, we propose DCCD-CONF, a novel
framework for differentiable learning of nonlinear cyclic causal graphs in the
presence of unmeasured confounders using interventional data. Our approach
alternates between optimizing the graph structure and estimating the confounder
distribution by maximizing the log-likelihood of the data. Through experiments
on synthetic data and real-world gene perturbation datasets, we show that
DCCD-CONF outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both causal graph recovery
and confounder identification. Additionally, we also provide consistency
guarantees for our framework, reinforcing its theoretical soundness.

Abstract: Liver cancer is one of the most prevalent and lethal forms of cancer, making
early detection crucial for effective treatment. This paper introduces a novel
approach for automated liver tumor segmentation in computed tomography (CT)
images by integrating a 3D U-Net architecture with the Bat Algorithm for
hyperparameter optimization. The method enhances segmentation accuracy and
robustness by intelligently optimizing key parameters like the learning rate
and batch size. Evaluated on a publicly available dataset, our model
demonstrates a strong ability to balance precision and recall, with a high
F1-score at lower prediction thresholds. This is particularly valuable for
clinical diagnostics, where ensuring no potential tumors are missed is
paramount. Our work contributes to the field of medical image analysis by
demonstrating that the synergy between a robust deep learning architecture and
a metaheuristic optimization algorithm can yield a highly effective solution
for complex segmentation tasks.

Result: 在多个数据集上验证，DiGNNExplainer 生成的解释更真实且忠实于模型决策，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DiGNNExplainer 填补了异构图解释方法的空白，为模型决策提供了更可靠的解释。

Abstract: Many real-world datasets, such as citation networks, social networks, and
molecular structures, are naturally represented as heterogeneous graphs, where
nodes belong to different types and have additional features. For example, in a
citation network, nodes representing "Paper" or "Author" may include attributes
like keywords or affiliations. A critical machine learning task on these graphs
is node classification, which is useful for applications such as fake news
detection, corporate risk assessment, and molecular property prediction.
Although Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) perform well in these
contexts, their predictions remain opaque. Existing post-hoc explanation
methods lack support for actual node features beyond one-hot encoding of node
type and often fail to generate realistic, faithful explanations. To address
these gaps, we propose DiGNNExplainer, a model-level explanation approach that
synthesizes heterogeneous graphs with realistic node features via discrete
denoising diffusion. In particular, we generate realistic discrete features
(e.g., bag-of-words features) using diffusion models within a discrete space,
whereas previous approaches are limited to continuous spaces. We evaluate our
approach on multiple datasets and show that DiGNNExplainer produces
explanations that are realistic and faithful to the model's decision-making,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统最优传输（OT）要求输入测度质量相等，而部分最优传输（POT）放宽了这一限制，但现有熵正则化方法生成的传输计划过于稠密，限制了其在需要稀疏性的应用中的使用。

Method: 提出了一种基于二次正则化的POT新方法（QPOT），通过二次正则化诱导稀疏性。

Result: 在合成数据集、CIFAR-10数据集以及颜色迁移和领域适应等实际应用中，QPOT表现出更高的稀疏性和优越性能。

Conclusion: QPOT为需要稀疏传输计划的应用提供了一种有效的替代方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Partial Optimal Transport (POT) has recently emerged as a central tool in
various Machine Learning (ML) applications. It lifts the stringent assumption
of the conventional Optimal Transport (OT) that input measures are of equal
masses, which is often not guaranteed in real-world datasets, and thus offers
greater flexibility by permitting transport between unbalanced input measures.
Nevertheless, existing major solvers for POT commonly rely on entropic
regularization for acceleration and thus return dense transport plans,
hindering the adoption of POT in various applications that favor sparsity. In
this paper, as an alternative approach to the entropic POT formulation in the
literature, we propose a novel formulation of POT with quadratic
regularization, hence termed quadratic regularized POT (QPOT), which induces
sparsity to the transport plan and consequently facilitates the adoption of POT
in many applications with sparsity requirements. Extensive experiments on
synthetic and CIFAR-10 datasets, as well as real-world applications such as
color transfer and domain adaptations, consistently demonstrate the improved
sparsity and favorable performance of our proposed QPOT formulation.

Conclusion: 该方法可扩展至多种异构环境（如云平台和多节点高性能计算集群），为异构资源下的神经网络训练提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Most large-scale neural network training methods assume homogeneous parallel
computing resources. For example, synchronous SGD with data parallelism, the
most widely used parallel training strategy, incurs significant synchronization
overhead when workers process their assigned data at different speeds.
Consequently, in systems with heterogeneous compute resources, users often rely
solely on the fastest components, such as GPUs, for training. In this work, we
explore how to effectively use heterogeneous resources for neural network
training. We propose a system-aware local stochastic gradient descent (local
SGD) method that allocates workloads to each compute resource in proportion to
its compute capacity. To make better use of slower resources such as CPUs, we
intentionally introduce bias into data sampling and model aggregation. Our
study shows that well-controlled bias can significantly accelerate local SGD in
heterogeneous environments, achieving comparable or even higher accuracy than
synchronous SGD with data-parallelism within the same time budget. This
fundamental parallelization strategy can be readily extended to diverse
heterogeneous environments, including cloud platforms and multi-node
high-performance computing clusters.

Abstract: Achieving accurate traffic prediction is a fundamental but crucial task in
the development of current intelligent transportation systems.Most of the
mainstream methods that have made breakthroughs in traffic prediction rely on
spatio-temporal graph neural networks, spatio-temporal attention mechanisms,
etc. The main challenges of the existing deep learning approaches are that they
either depend on a complete traffic network structure or require intricate
model designs to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies. These
limitations pose significant challenges for the efficient deployment and
operation of deep learning models on large-scale datasets. To address these
challenges, we propose a cost-effective graph-free Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
based model M3-Net for traffic prediction. Our proposed model not only employs
time series and spatio-temporal embeddings for efficient feature processing but
also first introduces a novel MLP-Mixer architecture with a mixture of experts

demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model in terms of prediction
performance and lightweight deployment.

Abstract: Spatiotemporal prediction plays a critical role in numerous real-world
applications such as urban planning, transportation optimization, disaster
response, and pandemic control. In recent years, researchers have made
significant progress by developing advanced deep learning models for
spatiotemporal prediction. However, most existing models are deterministic,
i.e., predicting only the expected mean values without quantifying uncertainty,
leading to potentially unreliable and inaccurate outcomes. While recent studies
have introduced probabilistic models to quantify uncertainty, they typically
focus on a single phenomenon (e.g., taxi, bike, crime, or traffic crashes),
thereby neglecting the inherent correlations among heterogeneous urban
phenomena. To address the research gap, we propose a novel Graph Neural Network
with Uncertainty Quantification, termed UQGNN for multivariate spatiotemporal
prediction. UQGNN introduces two key innovations: (i) an Interaction-aware
Spatiotemporal Embedding Module that integrates a multivariate diffusion graph
convolutional network and an interaction-aware temporal convolutional network
to effectively capture complex spatial and temporal interaction patterns, and
(ii) a multivariate probabilistic prediction module designed to estimate both
expected mean values and associated uncertainties. Extensive experiments on
four real-world multivariate spatiotemporal datasets from Shenzhen, New York
City, and Chicago demonstrate that UQGNN consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in both prediction accuracy and uncertainty
quantification. For example, on the Shenzhen dataset, UQGNN achieves a 5%
improvement in both prediction accuracy and uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: Federated learning enables distributed training with private data of clients,
but its convergence is hindered by data and system heterogeneity in realistic
communication scenarios. Most existing system heterogeneous FL schemes utilize
global pruning or ensemble distillation, yet they often overlook typical
constraints required for communication efficiency. Meanwhile, deep ensembles
can aggregate predictions from individually trained models to improve
performance, but current ensemble-based FL methods fall short in fully
capturing the diversity of model predictions. In this work, we propose SHEFL, a
global ensemble-based federated learning framework suited for clients with
diverse computational capacities. We allocate different numbers of global
models to clients based on their available resources. We further introduce a
novel aggregation scheme that accounts for bias between clients with different
computational capabilities. To reduce the computational burden of training deep
ensembles and mitigate data bias, we dynamically adjust the resource ratio
across clients - aggressively reducing the influence of underpowered clients in
constrained scenarios, while increasing their weight in the opposite case.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively addresses
computational heterogeneity, significantly improving both fairness and overall
performance compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL), as a distributed collaborative Machine Learning (ML)
framework under privacy-preserving constraints, has garnered increasing
research attention in cross-organizational data collaboration scenarios. This
paper proposes a class of distributed optimization algorithms based on the
augmented Lagrangian technique, designed to accommodate diverse communication
topologies in both centralized and decentralized FL settings. Furthermore, we
develop multiple termination criteria and parameter update mechanisms to
enhance computational efficiency, accompanied by rigorous theoretical
guarantees of convergence. By generalizing the augmented Lagrangian relaxation
through the incorporation of proximal relaxation and quadratic approximation,
our framework systematically recovers a broad of classical unconstrained
optimization methods, including proximal algorithm, classic gradient descent,
and stochastic gradient descent, among others. Notably, the convergence
properties of these methods can be naturally derived within the proposed
theoretical framework. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed
algorithm exhibits strong performance in large-scale settings with significant

Abstract: Low-rank training methods reduce the number of trainable parameters by
re-parameterizing the weights with matrix decompositions (e.g., singular value
decomposition). However, enforcing a fixed low-rank structure caps the rank of
the weight matrices and can hinder the model's ability to learn complex
patterns. Furthermore, the effective rank of the model's weights tends to
decline during training, and this drop is accelerated when the model is
reparameterized into a low-rank structure. In this study, we argue that
strategically interleaving full-rank training epochs within low-rank training
epochs can effectively restore the rank of the model's weights. Based on our
findings, we propose a general dynamic-rank training framework that is readily
applicable to a wide range of neural-network tasks. We first describe how to
adjust the rank of weight matrix to alleviate the inevitable rank collapse that
arises during training, and then present extensive empirical results that
validate our claims and demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework. Our
empirical study shows that the proposed method achieves almost the same
computational cost as SVD-based low-rank training while achieving a comparable
accuracy to full-rank training across various benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 专业语义分类任务需要领域专家标注且推理吞吐量高，限制了模型规模和成本，因此需要定制化的小型语言模型。

Method: 通过识别并微调模型中对任务敏感的参数子集，利用任务特定令牌构造，不引入额外参数。

Result: 在五个语义分类任务中表现优于全微调、LoRA等方法，训练成本减半且更稳定。

Conclusion: 令牌驱动的稀疏微调是一种高效且稳定的方法，适用于专业语义分类任务。

Abstract: Semantic text classification requires the understanding of the contextual
significance of specific tokens rather than surface-level patterns or keywords
(as in rule-based or statistical text classification), making large language
models (LLMs) well-suited for this task. However, semantic classification
applications in industry, like customer intent detection or semantic role
labeling, tend to be highly specialized. They require annotation by domain
experts in contrast to general-purpose corpora for pretraining. Further, they
typically require high inference throughputs which limits the model size from
latency and cost perspectives. Thus, for a range of specialized classification
tasks, the preferred solution is to develop customized classifiers by
finetuning smaller language models (e.g., mini-encoders, small language
models).
  In this work, we develop a token-driven sparse finetuning strategy to adapt
small language models to specialized classification tasks. We identify and
finetune a small sensitive subset of model parameters by leveraging
task-specific token constructs in the finetuning dataset, while leaving most of
the pretrained weights unchanged. Unlike adapter approaches such as low rank
adaptation (LoRA), we do not introduce additional parameters to the model. Our
approach identifies highly relevant semantic tokens (case study in the
Appendix) and outperforms end-to-end finetuning, LoRA, layer selection, and
prefix tuning on five diverse semantic classification tasks. We achieve greater
stability and half the training costs vs. end-to-end finetuning.

Conclusion: MiGrATe展示了在线测试时训练在无需外部监督的复杂搜索任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied to black-box
optimization tasks, from program synthesis to molecule design. Prior work
typically leverages in-context learning to iteratively guide the model towards
better solutions. Such methods, however, often struggle to balance exploration
of new solution spaces with exploitation of high-reward ones. Recently,
test-time training (TTT) with synthetic data has shown promise in improving
solution quality. However, the need for hand-crafted training data tailored to
each task limits feasibility and scalability across domains. To address this
problem, we introduce MiGrATe-a method for online TTT that uses GRPO as a
search algorithm to adapt LLMs at inference without requiring external training
data. MiGrATe operates via a mixed-policy group construction procedure that
combines on-policy sampling with two off-policy data selection techniques:
greedy sampling, which selects top-performing past completions, and
neighborhood sampling (NS), which generates completions structurally similar to
high-reward ones. Together, these components bias the policy gradient towards
exploitation of promising regions in solution space, while preserving
exploration through on-policy sampling. We evaluate MiGrATe on three
challenging domains-word search, molecule optimization, and hypothesis+program
induction on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC)-and find that it
consistently outperforms both inference-only and TTT baselines, demonstrating
the potential of online TTT as a solution for complex search tasks without
external supervision.

Abstract: Accurate molecular property prediction is a critical challenge with
wide-ranging applications in chemistry, materials science, and drug discovery.
Molecular representation methods, including fingerprints and graph neural
networks (GNNs), achieve state-of-the-art results by effectively deriving
features from molecular structures. However, these methods often overlook
decades of accumulated semantic and contextual knowledge. Recent advancements
in large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable reasoning abilities and
prior knowledge across scientific domains, leading us to hypothesize that LLMs
can generate rich molecular representations when guided to reason in multiple
perspectives. To address these gaps, we propose $\text{M}^{2}$LLM, a multi-view
framework that integrates three perspectives: the molecular structure view, the
molecular task view, and the molecular rules view. These views are fused
dynamically to adapt to task requirements, and experiments demonstrate that
$\text{M}^{2}$LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks
across classification and regression tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that
representation derived from LLM achieves exceptional performance by leveraging
two core functionalities: the generation of molecular embeddings through their
encoding capabilities and the curation of molecular features through advanced
reasoning processes.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于全局工作空间模型（GWM）和多级协作蒸馏机制的新方法，以解决在线类增量学习（OCIL）中的稳定性和适应性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线类增量学习（OCIL）在非独立同分布数据流中学习时面临稳定性和适应性的挑战，尤其是在严格的内存限制下。

Method: 通过融合多个学生模型的参数形成GWM，作为动态锚点进行知识整合，并结合多级协作蒸馏机制保持学生模型间的一致性。

Result: 在三个标准OCIL基准测试中，该方法显著提升了多种OCIL模型的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在稳定性和适应性之间取得了更好的平衡，适用于不同内存预算的场景。

Abstract: Online Class-Incremental Learning (OCIL) enables models to learn continuously
from non-i.i.d. data streams and samples of the data streams can be seen only
once, making it more suitable for real-world scenarios compared to offline
learning. However, OCIL faces two key challenges: maintaining model stability
under strict memory constraints and ensuring adaptability to new tasks. Under
stricter memory constraints, current replay-based methods are less effective.
While ensemble methods improve adaptability (plasticity), they often struggle
with stability. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel approach that
enhances ensemble learning through a Global Workspace Model (GWM)-a shared,
implicit memory that guides the learning of multiple student models. The GWM is
formed by fusing the parameters of all students within each training batch,
capturing the historical learning trajectory and serving as a dynamic anchor
for knowledge consolidation. This fused model is then redistributed
periodically to the students to stabilize learning and promote cross-task
consistency. In addition, we introduce a multi-level collaborative distillation
mechanism. This approach enforces peer-to-peer consistency among students and
preserves historical knowledge by aligning each student with the GWM. As a
result, student models remain adaptable to new tasks while maintaining
previously learned knowledge, striking a better balance between stability and
plasticity. Extensive experiments on three standard OCIL benchmarks show that
our method delivers significant performance improvement for several OCIL models
across various memory budgets.

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了生成式出价的局限性，显著提升了广告系统的性能。

Abstract: Auto-bidding is extensively applied in advertising systems, serving a
multitude of advertisers. Generative bidding is gradually gaining traction due
to its robust planning capabilities and generalizability. In contrast to
traditional reinforcement learning-based bidding, generative bidding does not
rely on the Markov Decision Process (MDP) exhibiting superior planning
capabilities in long-horizon scenarios. Conditional diffusion modeling
approaches have demonstrated significant potential in the realm of
auto-bidding. However, relying solely on return as the optimality condition is
weak to guarantee the generation of genuinely optimal decision sequences,
lacking personalized structural information. Moreover, diffusion models' t-step
autoregressive generation mechanism inherently carries timeliness risks. To
address these issues, we propose a novel conditional diffusion modeling method
based on expert trajectory guidance combined with a skip-step sampling strategy
to enhance generation efficiency. We have validated the effectiveness of this
approach through extensive offline experiments and achieved statistically
significant results in online A/B testing, achieving an increase of 11.29% in
conversion and a 12.35% in revenue compared with the baseline.

Conclusion: COGS通过生成式采样增强了神经网络的分布鲁棒性，为实际物流问题提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic NP-hard combinatorial
optimization task with numerous practical applications. Classic heuristic
solvers can attain near-optimal performance for small problem instances, but
become computationally intractable for larger problems. Real-world logistics
problems such as dynamically re-routing last-mile deliveries demand a solver
with fast inference time, which has led researchers to investigate specialized
neural network solvers. However, neural networks struggle to generalize beyond
the synthetic data they were trained on. In particular, we show that there
exist TSP distributions that are realistic in practice, which also consistently
lead to poor worst-case performance for existing neural approaches. To address
this issue of distribution robustness, we present Combinatorial Optimization
with Generative Sampling (COGS), where training data is sampled from a
generative TSP model. We show that COGS provides better data coverage and
interpolation in the space of TSP training distributions. We also present
TSPLib50, a dataset of realistically distributed TSP samples, which tests
real-world generalization ability without conflating this issue with instance
size. We evaluate our method on various synthetic datasets as well as TSPLib50,
and compare to state-of-the-art neural baselines. We demonstrate that COGS
improves distribution robustness, with most performance gains coming from
worst-case scenarios.

Conclusion: 本文为理解RF模型在生成任务中的优异表现提供了首个理论依据，推动了相关研究的进一步发展。

Abstract: Recently, rectified flow (RF)-based models have achieved state-of-the-art
performance in many areas for both the multi-step and one-step generation.
However, only a few theoretical works analyze the discretization complexity of
RF-based models. Existing works either focus on flow-based models with
stochastic samplers or establish complexity results that exhibit exponential
dependence on problem parameters. In this work, under the realistic bounded
support assumption, we prove the first polynomial discretization complexity for
multi-step and one-step RF-based models with a deterministic sampler
simultaneously. For the multi-step setting, inspired by the predictor-corrector
framework of diffusion models, we introduce a Langevin process as a corrector
and show that RF-based models can achieve better polynomial discretization
complexity than diffusion models. To achieve this result, we conduct a detailed
analysis of the RF-based model and explain why it is better than previous
popular models, such as variance preserving (VP) and variance exploding
(VE)-based models. Based on the observation of multi-step RF-based models, we
further provide the first polynomial discretization complexity result for
one-step RF-based models, improving upon prior results for one-step
diffusion-based models. These findings mark the first step toward theoretically
understanding the impressive empirical performance of RF-based models in both
multi-step and one-step generation.

Motivation: 传统奖励模型（RMs）缺乏解释性，难以适应偏好变化，多维RMs虽改进了解释性但成本高且无法提供特征级归因。

Method: 引入SARM架构，结合预训练的稀疏自编码器（SAE），将LLM隐藏激活映射到稀疏且单义的特征空间，生成透明且有意义的奖励分数。

Result: SARM实现了特征级奖励归因，动态适应偏好变化，并在对齐性能上优于传统模型。

Conclusion: SARM为奖励模型提供了解释性和灵活性，显著提升了与人类价值观的对齐效果。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely deployed across numerous
fields. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) leverages reward
models (RMs) as proxies for human preferences to align LLM behaviors with human
values, making the accuracy, reliability, and interpretability of RMs critical
for effective alignment. However, traditional RMs lack interpretability, offer
limited insight into the reasoning behind reward assignments, and are
inflexible toward user preference shifts. While recent multidimensional RMs aim
for improved interpretability, they often fail to provide feature-level
attribution and require costly annotations. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce the Sparse Autoencoder-enhanced Reward Model (\textbf{SARM}), a novel
architecture that integrates a pretrained Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) into a
reward model. SARM maps the hidden activations of LLM-based RM into an
interpretable, sparse, and monosemantic feature space, from which a scalar head
aggregates feature activations to produce transparent and conceptually
meaningful reward scores. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that SARM
facilitates direct feature-level attribution of reward assignments, allows
dynamic adjustment to preference shifts, and achieves superior alignment
performance compared to conventional reward models. Our code is available at

Conclusion: DiFac通过差异化因子一致性框架，有效解决了半监督学习中的关键问题，并展示了其优越性能。

Abstract: In semi-supervised learning (SSL) for enhancing the performance of graph
neural networks (GNNs) with unlabeled data, introducing mutually independent
decision factors for cross-validation is regarded as an effective strategy to
alleviate pseudo-label confirmation bias and training collapse. However,
obtaining such factors is challenging in practice: additional and valid
information sources are inherently scarce, and even when such sources are
available, their independence from the original source cannot be guaranteed. To
address this challenge, In this paper we propose a Differentiated Factor
Consistency Semi-supervised Framework (DiFac), which derives differentiated
factors from a single information source and enforces their consistency. During
pre-training, the model learns to extract these factors; in training, it
iteratively removes samples with conflicting factors and ranks pseudo-labels
based on the shortest stave principle, selecting the top candidate samples to
reduce overconfidence commonly observed in confidence-based or ensemble-based
methods. Our framework can also incorporate additional information sources. In
this work, we leverage the large multimodal language model to introduce latent
textual knowledge as auxiliary decision factors, and we design a accountability
scoring mechanism to mitigate additional erroneous judgments introduced by
these auxiliary factors. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate
that DiFac consistently improves robustness and generalization in low-label
regimes, outperforming other baseline methods.

Conclusion: TechOps模板可作为实用工具，支持监管合规和负责任的AI开发。

Abstract: Operationalizing the EU AI Act requires clear technical documentation to
ensure AI systems are transparent, traceable, and accountable. Existing
documentation templates for AI systems do not fully cover the entire AI
lifecycle while meeting the technical documentation requirements of the AI Act.
  This paper addresses those shortcomings by introducing open-source templates
and examples for documenting data, models, and applications to provide
sufficient documentation for certifying compliance with the AI Act. These
templates track the system status over the entire AI lifecycle, ensuring
traceability, reproducibility, and compliance with the AI Act. They also
promote discoverability and collaboration, reduce risks, and align with best
practices in AI documentation and governance.
  The templates are evaluated and refined based on user feedback to enable
insights into their usability and implementability. We then validate the
approach on real-world scenarios, providing examples that further guide their
implementation: the data template is followed to document a skin tones dataset
created to support fairness evaluations of downstream computer vision models
and human-centric applications; the model template is followed to document a
neural network for segmenting human silhouettes in photos. The application
template is tested on a system deployed for construction site safety using
real-time video analytics and sensor data. Our results show that TechOps can
serve as a practical tool to enable oversight for regulatory compliance and
responsible AI development.

Result: 在真实网络数据集上的实验表明，TempOpt学习的告警关系质量优于时间依赖方法。

Conclusion: TempOpt是一种实用且高效的告警关系学习技术，适用于电信网络中的根告警识别。

Abstract: In a telecommunications network, fault alarms generated by network nodes are
monitored in a Network Operations Centre (NOC) to ensure network availability
and continuous network operations. The monitoring process comprises of tasks
such as active alarms analysis, root alarm identification, and resolution of
the underlying problem. Each network node potentially can generate alarms of
different types, while nodes can be from multiple vendors, a network can have
hundreds of nodes thus resulting in an enormous volume of alarms at any time.
Since network nodes are inter-connected, a single fault in the network would
trigger multiple sequences of alarms across a variety of nodes and from a
monitoring point of view, it is a challenging task for a NOC engineer to be
aware of relations between the various alarms, when trying to identify, for
example, a root alarm on which an action needs to be taken. To effectively
identify root alarms, it is essential to learn relation among the alarms for
accurate and faster resolution. In this work we propose a novel unsupervised
alarm relation learning technique Temporal Optimization (TempOpt) that is
practical and overcomes the limitations of an existing class of alarm
relational learning method-temporal dependency methods. Experiments have been
carried on real-world network datasets, that demonstrate the improved quality
of alarm relations learned by TempOpt as compared to temporal dependency
method.

Motivation: 传统Transformer参数过多且难以捕捉非平稳特征，MLP在多通道依赖上表现不佳，因此需要一种更高效的模型。

Method: WaveTS-B结合小波变换与MLP捕捉数据周期性及非平稳特征；WaveTS-M进一步引入通道聚类和MoE框架处理多通道依赖。

Result: 在八个真实数据集上，WaveTS系列模型以更少参数达到SOTA性能，WaveTS-M在多通道数据上表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: WaveTS系列模型高效且轻量，特别适合多通道时间序列预测。

Abstract: The field of time series forecasting is rapidly advancing, with recent
large-scale Transformers and lightweight Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models
showing strong predictive performance. However, conventional Transformer models
are often hindered by their large number of parameters and their limited
ability to capture non-stationary features in data through smoothing.
Similarly, MLP models struggle to manage multi-channel dependencies
effectively. To address these limitations, we propose a novel, lightweight time
series prediction model, WaveTS-B. This model combines wavelet transforms with
MLP to capture both periodic and non-stationary characteristics of data in the
wavelet domain. Building on this foundation, we propose a channel clustering
strategy that incorporates a Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework, utilizing a
gating mechanism and expert network to handle multi-channel dependencies
efficiently. We propose WaveTS-M, an advanced model tailored for multi-channel
time series prediction. Empirical evaluation across eight real-world time
series datasets demonstrates that our WaveTS series models achieve
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with significantly fewer parameters.
Notably, WaveTS-M shows substantial improvements on multi-channel datasets,
highlighting its effectiveness.

Abstract: Generative machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool for design
representation and exploration. However, its application is often constrained
by the need for large datasets of existing designs and the lack of
interpretability about what features drive optimality. To address these
challenges, we introduce a systematic framework for constructing training
datasets tailored to generative models and demonstrate how these models can be
leveraged for interpretable design. The novelty of this work is twofold: (i) we
present a systematic framework for generating archetypes with internally
homogeneous but mutually heterogeneous inputs that can be used to generate a
training dataset, and (ii) we show how integrating generative models with
Bayesian optimization can enhance the interpretability of the latent space of
admissible designs. These findings are validated by using the framework to
design a flow battery manifold, demonstrating that it effectively captures the
space of feasible designs, including novel configurations while enabling
efficient exploration. This work broadens the applicability of generative
machine-learning models in system designs by enhancing quality and reliability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦LLM框架缺乏对隐私法规（如GDPR遗忘权）的支持，且无法选择性删除特定客户数据。

Method: 提出Oblivionis框架，将FL和遗忘作为双重优化目标，整合6种FL和5种遗忘算法。

Result: 实验表明Oblivionis优于本地训练，在遗忘效果和模型效用间取得平衡。

Conclusion: Oblivionis为联邦LLM的隐私合规提供了有效解决方案，并为未来LLM发展指明方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly leverage Federated Learning (FL) to
utilize private, task-specific datasets for fine-tuning while preserving data
privacy. However, while federated LLM frameworks effectively enable
collaborative training without raw data sharing, they critically lack built-in
mechanisms for regulatory compliance like GDPR's right to be forgotten.
Integrating private data heightens concerns over data quality and long-term
governance, yet existing distributed training frameworks offer no principled
way to selectively remove specific client contributions post-training. Due to
distributed data silos, stringent privacy constraints, and the intricacies of
interdependent model aggregation, federated LLM unlearning is significantly
more complex than centralized LLM unlearning. To address this gap, we introduce
Oblivionis, a lightweight learning and unlearning framework that enables
clients to selectively remove specific private data during federated LLM
training, enhancing trustworthiness and regulatory compliance. By unifying FL
and unlearning as a dual optimization objective, we incorporate 6 FL and 5
unlearning algorithms for comprehensive evaluation and comparative analysis,
establishing a robust pipeline for federated LLM unlearning. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Oblivionis outperforms local training, achieving a
robust balance between forgetting efficacy and model utility, with
cross-algorithm comparisons providing clear directions for future LLM
development.

Abstract: Building modern deep learning systems that are not just effective but also
efficient requires rethinking established paradigms for model training and
neural architecture design. Instead of adapting highly overparameterized
networks and subsequently applying model compression techniques to reduce
resource consumption, a new class of high-performing networks skips the need
for expensive parameter updates, while requiring only a fraction of parameters,
making them highly scalable. The Strong Lottery Ticket Hypothesis posits that
within randomly initialized, sufficiently overparameterized neural networks,
there exist subnetworks that can match the accuracy of the trained original
model-without any training. This work explores the usage of genetic algorithms
for identifying these strong lottery ticket subnetworks. We find that for
instances of binary and multi-class classification tasks, our approach achieves
better accuracies and sparsity levels than the current state-of-the-art without
requiring any gradient information. In addition, we provide justification for
the need for appropriate evaluation metrics when scaling to more complex
network architectures and learning tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何在贝叶斯神经网络（BNNs）中通过可训练激活函数实现函数空间先验，以增强正则化、不确定性量化和风险感知决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 函数空间先验能更直观地将先验信念嵌入模型输出，但实现这一目标在BNNs中具有挑战性。

Method: 通过优化技术研究可训练激活函数（如Pade函数和分段线性函数）如何适应高复杂度先验并匹配目标函数分布，同时探讨了学习中的可识别性、损失构造和对称性问题。

Result: 实验表明，即使单层宽隐藏层的BNNs，配备灵活的可训练激活函数，也能有效实现所需的函数空间先验。

Conclusion: 灵活的可训练激活函数是实现函数空间先验的有效方法，为BNNs的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Function-space priors in Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) provide a more
intuitive approach to embedding beliefs directly into the model's output,
thereby enhancing regularization, uncertainty quantification, and risk-aware
decision-making. However, imposing function-space priors on BNNs is
challenging. We address this task through optimization techniques that explore
how trainable activations can accommodate higher-complexity priors and match
intricate target function distributions. We investigate flexible activation
models, including Pade functions and piecewise linear functions, and discuss
the learning challenges related to identifiability, loss construction, and
symmetries. Our empirical findings indicate that even BNNs with a single wide
hidden layer when equipped with flexible trainable activation, can effectively
achieve desired function-space priors.

Abstract: Causal machine learning has the potential to revolutionize decision-making by
combining the predictive power of machine learning algorithms with the theory
of causal inference. However, these methods remain underutilized by the broader
machine learning community, in part because current empirical evaluations do
not permit assessment of their reliability and robustness, undermining their
practical utility. Specifically, one of the principal criticisms made by the
community is the extensive use of synthetic experiments. We argue, on the
contrary, that synthetic experiments are essential and necessary to precisely
assess and understand the capabilities of causal machine learning methods. To
substantiate our position, we critically review the current evaluation
practices, spotlight their shortcomings, and propose a set of principles for
conducting rigorous empirical analyses with synthetic data. Adopting the
proposed principles will enable comprehensive evaluations that build trust in
causal machine learning methods, driving their broader adoption and impactful
real-world use.

Result: 实验表明APRNet在捕捉时变模式上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: APRNet通过解耦振幅和相位，显著提升了时间序列预测的准确性。

Abstract: Deep learning-based time series forecasting has found widespread
applications. Recently, converting time series data into the frequency domain
for forecasting has become popular for accurately exploring periodic patterns.
However, existing methods often cannot effectively explore stationary
information from complex intertwined frequency components. In this paper, we
propose a simple yet effective Amplitude-Phase Reconstruct Network (APRNet)
that models the inter-relationships of amplitude and phase, which prevents the
amplitude and phase from being constrained by different physical quantities,
thereby decoupling the distinct characteristics of signals for capturing
stationary information. Specifically, we represent the multivariate time series
input across sequence and channel dimensions, highlighting the correlation
between amplitude and phase at multiple interaction frequencies. We propose a
novel Kolmogorov-Arnold-Network-based Local Correlation (KLC) module to
adaptively fit local functions using univariate functions, enabling more
flexible characterization of stationary features across different amplitudes
and phases. This significantly enhances the model's capability to capture
time-varying patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our
APRNet against the state-of-the-arts (SOTAs).

Result: 发现持续学习方法对阶段转移攻击高度敏感，现有防御方法效果有限。

Conclusion: 揭示了持续学习模型的安全隐患，呼吁开发更有效的防御策略。

Abstract: Class-incremental continual learning addresses catastrophic forgetting by
enabling classification models to preserve knowledge of previously learned
classes while acquiring new ones. However, the vulnerability of the models
against adversarial attacks during this process has not been investigated
sufficiently. In this paper, we present the first exploration of vulnerability
to stage-transferred attacks, i.e., an adversarial example generated using the
model in an earlier stage is used to attack the model in a later stage. Our
findings reveal that continual learning methods are highly susceptible to these
attacks, raising a serious security issue. We explain this phenomenon through
model similarity between stages and gradual robustness degradation.
Additionally, we find that existing adversarial training-based defense methods
are not sufficiently effective to stage-transferred attacks. Codes are
available at https://github.com/mcml-official/CSAT.

Conclusion: LNN-PINN为复杂问题中的物理信息神经网络提供了一种简洁有效的架构改进方案。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have attracted considerable
attention for their ability to integrate partial differential equation priors
into deep learning frameworks; however, they often exhibit limited predictive
accuracy when applied to complex problems. To address this issue, we propose
LNN-PINN, a physics-informed neural network framework that incorporates a
liquid residual gating architecture while preserving the original physics
modeling and optimization pipeline to improve predictive accuracy. The method
introduces a lightweight gating mechanism solely within the hidden-layer
mapping, keeping the sampling strategy, loss composition, and hyperparameter
settings unchanged to ensure that improvements arise purely from architectural
refinement. Across four benchmark problems, LNN-PINN consistently reduced RMSE
and MAE under identical training conditions, with absolute error plots further
confirming its accuracy gains. Moreover, the framework demonstrates strong
adaptability and stability across varying dimensions, boundary conditions, and
operator characteristics. In summary, LNN-PINN offers a concise and effective
architectural enhancement for improving the predictive accuracy of
physics-informed neural networks in complex scientific and engineering
problems.

Motivation: 由于传感器部署成本高，许多区域缺乏历史交通数据，现有模型泛化能力受限。

Method: 结合物理信息神经网络、外部信号学习模块和空间分组模块，补偿缺失数据并提升泛化能力。

Result: 在多组真实数据集上，GenCast显著降低了预测误差。

Conclusion: GenCast通过整合外部知识和物理约束，有效解决了无传感器区域的交通预测问题。

Abstract: Traffic forecasting is essential for intelligent transportation systems.
Accurate forecasting relies on continuous observations collected by traffic
sensors. However, due to high deployment and maintenance costs, not all regions
are equipped with such sensors. This paper aims to forecast for regions without
traffic sensors, where the lack of historical traffic observations challenges
the generalisability of existing models. We propose a model named GenCast, the
core idea of which is to exploit external knowledge to compensate for the
missing observations and to enhance generalisation. We integrate
physics-informed neural networks into GenCast, enabling physical principles to
regularise the learning process. We introduce an external signal learning
module to explore correlations between traffic states and external signals such
as weather conditions, further improving model generalisability. Additionally,
we design a spatial grouping module to filter localised features that hinder
model generalisability. Extensive experiments show that GenCast consistently
reduces forecasting errors on multiple real-world datasets.

Result: 实验表明，GRAVITY在转导和归纳顶点分类任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: GRAVITY通过动态交互和势场优化，显著提升了顶点分类的准确性和语义一致性。

Abstract: In the quest of accurate vertex classification, we introduce GRAVITY
(Graph-based Representation leArning via Vertices Interaction TopologY), a
framework inspired by physical systems where objects self-organize under
attractive forces. GRAVITY models each vertex as exerting influence through
learned interactions shaped by structural proximity and attribute similarity.
These interactions induce a latent potential field in which vertices move
toward energy efficient positions, coalescing around class-consistent
attractors and distancing themselves from unrelated groups. Unlike traditional
message-passing schemes with static neighborhoods, GRAVITY adaptively modulates
the receptive field of each vertex based on a learned force function, enabling
dynamic aggregation driven by context. This field-driven organization sharpens
class boundaries and promotes semantic coherence within latent clusters.
Experiments on real-world benchmarks show that GRAVITY yields competitive
embeddings, excelling in both transductive and inductive vertex classification
tasks.

Conclusion: 频域信息在时间序列对抗攻击中具有重要价值，未来研究可进一步探索其潜力。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have made significant progress in time series
forecasting. However, a key limitation of deep learning models is their
susceptibility to adversarial attacks, which has not been studied enough in the
context of time series prediction. In contrast to areas such as computer
vision, where adversarial robustness has been extensively studied, frequency
domain features of time series data play an important role in the prediction
task but have not been sufficiently explored in terms of adversarial attacks.
This paper proposes a time series prediction attack algorithm based on
frequency domain loss. Specifically, we adapt an attack method originally
designed for classification tasks to the prediction field and optimize the
adversarial samples using both time-domain and frequency-domain losses. To the
best of our knowledge, there is no relevant research on using frequency
information for time-series adversarial attacks. Our experimental results show
that these current time series prediction models are vulnerable to adversarial
attacks, and our approach achieves excellent performance on major time series
forecasting datasets.

Motivation: 注意力机制在Transformer架构中扮演核心角色，其权重信息虽不直接决定模型输出，但能反映token间的影响模式。研究旨在探索如何将这些信息整合到XAI框架中，以提供更有意义的模型解释。

Method: 提出了两种新方法：1）将注意力权重整合到Shapley值分解中，通过重新定义特征函数来提供局部解释；2）将注意力权重与概念激活向量结合，用于全局解释中的概念敏感性测量。

Result: 在标准基准测试和与其他广泛使用的解释方法对比中，实验表明注意力权重可以有效地整合到XAI框架中，丰富了Transformer的可解释性。

Conclusion: 注意力权重能够为XAI框架提供有价值的信息，增强Transformer模型的解释能力，为未来的可解释性研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: The attention mechanism lies at the core of the transformer architecture,
providing an interpretable model-internal signal that has motivated a growing
interest in attention-based model explanations. Although attention weights do
not directly determine model outputs, they reflect patterns of token influence
that can inform and complement established explainability techniques. This work
studies the potential of utilising the information encoded in attention weights
to provide meaningful model explanations by integrating them into explainable
AI (XAI) frameworks that target fundamentally different aspects of model
behaviour. To this end, we develop two novel explanation methods applicable to
both natural language processing and computer vision tasks. The first
integrates attention weights into the Shapley value decomposition by redefining
the characteristic function in terms of pairwise token interactions via
attention weights, thus adapting this widely used game-theoretic solution
concept to provide attention-driven attributions for local explanations. The
second incorporates attention weights into token-level directional derivatives
defined through concept activation vectors to measure concept sensitivity for
global explanations. Our empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks and in a
comparison study with widely used explanation methods show that attention
weights can be meaningfully incorporated into the studied XAI frameworks,
highlighting their value in enriching transformer explainability.

Conclusion: 仿真实验表明，所提策略优于现有HIL方法，适用于资源受限设备。

Abstract: This work focuses on Hierarchical Inference (HI) in edge intelligence
systems, where a compact Local-ML model on an end-device works in conjunction
with a high-accuracy Remote-ML model on an edge-server. HI aims to reduce
latency, improve accuracy, and lower bandwidth usage by first using the
Local-ML model for inference and offloading to the Remote-ML only when the
local inference is likely incorrect. A critical challenge in HI is estimating
the likelihood of the local inference being incorrect, especially when data
distributions and offloading costs change over time -- a problem we term
Hierarchical Inference Learning (HIL). We introduce a novel approach to HIL by
modeling the probability of correct inference by the Local-ML as an increasing
function of the model's confidence measure, a structure motivated by empirical
observations but previously unexploited. We propose two policies, HI-LCB and
HI-LCB-lite, based on the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) framework. We
demonstrate that both policies achieve order-optimal regret of $O(\log T)$, a
significant improvement over existing HIL policies with $O(T^{2/3})$ regret
guarantees. Notably, HI-LCB-lite has an $O(1)$ per-sample computational
complexity, making it well-suited for deployment on devices with severe
resource limitations. Simulations using real-world datasets confirm that our
policies outperform existing state-of-the-art HIL methods.

Abstract: Designing mechanical mechanisms to trace specific paths is a classic yet
notoriously difficult engineering problem, characterized by a vast and complex
search space of discrete topologies and continuous parameters. We introduce
MechaFormer, a Transformer-based model that tackles this challenge by treating
mechanism design as a conditional sequence generation task. Our model learns to
translate a target curve into a domain-specific language (DSL) string,
simultaneously determining the mechanism's topology and geometric parameters in
a single, unified process. MechaFormer significantly outperforms existing
baselines, achieving state-of-the-art path-matching accuracy and generating a
wide diversity of novel and valid designs. We demonstrate a suite of sampling
strategies that can dramatically improve solution quality and offer designers
valuable flexibility. Furthermore, we show that the high-quality outputs from
MechaFormer serve as excellent starting points for traditional optimizers,
creating a hybrid approach that finds superior solutions with remarkable
efficiency.

Motivation: 现实世界中的网络数据通常不完整，现有链接预测算法在不同网络上的表现差异较大，缺乏系统比较和优化方法。

Method: 使用550个真实网络作为基准，比较了四种模型堆叠算法、42种拓扑链接预测器和两种图神经网络算法，并提出了两种新预测器。

Result: 结果表明，没有一种算法在所有网络上表现最佳，模型堆叠在AUC上优于图神经网络，而算法性能与网络特性（如度分布、三角密度等）密切相关。

Conclusion: 提出的元学习算法能根据网络特性选择最佳算法，显著优于现有方法，并具有可扩展性。

Abstract: Relational data are ubiquitous in real-world data applications, e.g., in
social network analysis or biological modeling, but networks are nearly always
incompletely observed. The state-of-the-art for predicting missing links in the
hard case of a network without node attributes uses model stacking or neural
network techniques. It remains unknown which approach is best, and whether or
how the best choice of algorithm depends on the input network's
characteristics. We answer these questions systematically using a large,
structurally diverse benchmark of 550 real-world networks under two standard
accuracy measures (AUC and Top-k), comparing four stacking algorithms with 42
topological link predictors, two of which we introduce here, and two graph
neural network algorithms. We show that no algorithm is best across all input
networks, all algorithms perform well on most social networks, and few perform
well on economic and biological networks. Overall, model stacking with a random
forest is both highly scalable and surpasses on AUC or is competitive with
graph neural networks on Top-k accuracy. But, algorithm performance depends
strongly on network characteristics like the degree distribution, triangle
density, and degree assortativity. We introduce a meta-learning algorithm that
exploits this variability to optimize link predictions for individual networks
by selecting the best algorithm to apply, which we show outperforms all
state-of-the-art algorithms and scales to large networks.

Result: 该方法能以更少的数据更有效地评估LLM性能。

Conclusion: 研究成功将主动测试扩展至大型语言模型评估，降低了计算和数据需求。

Abstract: Active testing enables label-efficient evaluation of models through careful
data acquisition. However, its significant computational costs have previously
undermined its use for large models. We show how it can be successfully scaled
up to the evaluation of large language models (LLMs). In particular we show
that the surrogate model used to guide data acquisition can be constructed
cheaply using in-context learning, does not require updating within an
active-testing loop, and can be smaller than the target model. We even find we
can make good data-acquisition decisions without computing predictions with the
target model and further introduce a single-run error estimator to asses how
well active testing is working on the fly. We find that our approach is able to
more effectively evaluate LLM performance with less data than current standard
practices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决GNN在手性预测任务中缺乏可解释性和基准化的问题，Chi-Geometry提供了一种可控且无干扰的测试环境。

Method: 生成具有指定几何和拓扑特征的合成图样本，每个图包含一个标记为R或S的手性中心，其余节点标记为N/A。

Result: 通过基准测试，设计出两种新GNN架构：一种通过全连接提高准确性但计算成本高，另一种引入虚拟节点保持线性计算成本。

Conclusion: Chi-Geometry为GNN手性预测提供了有效的基准化工具，并指导了高效且准确的新架构设计。

Abstract: We introduce Chi-Geometry - a library that generates graph data for testing
and benchmarking GNNs' ability to predict chirality. Chi-Geometry generates
synthetic graph samples with (i) user-specified geometric and topological
traits to isolate certain types of samples and (ii) randomized node positions
and species to minimize extraneous correlations. Each generated graph contains
exactly one chiral center labeled either R or S, while all other nodes are
labeled N/A (non-chiral). The generated samples are then combined into a
cohesive dataset that can be used to assess a GNN's ability to predict
chirality as a node classification task. Chi-Geometry allows more interpretable
and less confounding benchmarking of GNNs for prediction of chirality in the
graph samples which can guide the design of new GNN architectures with improved
predictive performance. We illustrate Chi-Geometry's efficacy by using it to
generate synthetic datasets for benchmarking various state-of-the-art (SOTA)
GNN architectures. The conclusions of these benchmarking results guided our
design of two new GNN architectures. The first GNN architecture established
all-to-all connections in the graph to accurately predict chirality across all
challenging configurations where previously tested SOTA models failed, but at a
computational cost (both for training and inference) that grows quadratically
with the number of graph nodes. The second GNN architecture avoids all-to-all
connections by introducing a virtual node in the original graph structure of
the data, which restores the linear scaling of training and inference
computational cost with respect to the number of nodes in the graph, while
still ensuring competitive accuracy in detecting chirality with respect to SOTA

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合自然语言推理和形式化语言的混合推理方法（GF-Reasoner），通过监督微调和强化学习提升几何问题求解能力，显著优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在几何问题求解（GPS）中存在局限性，主要是由于不可靠的图表解释和纯自然语言推理。直接生成形式化程序的方法缺乏中间推理，导致决策过程不透明且易出错。

Method: 提出混合推理方法，结合自然语言推理和形式化语言生成，通过监督微调和强化学习优化推理过程。

Result: GF-Reasoner在标准GPS基准测试中准确率提升15%，优于7B规模及更大的72B模型，生成更简洁的推理轨迹。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合自然语言和形式化语言推理，显著提升几何问题求解能力，并为未来研究提供了设计选择的详细分析。

Abstract: Large vision language models exhibit notable limitations on Geometry Problem
Solving (GPS) because of their unreliable diagram interpretation and pure
natural-language reasoning. A recent line of work mitigates this by using
symbolic solvers: the model directly generates a formal program that a geometry
solver can execute. However, this direct program generation lacks intermediate
reasoning, making the decision process opaque and prone to errors. In this
work, we explore a new approach that integrates Chain-of-Thought (CoT) with
formal language. The model interleaves natural language reasoning with
incremental emission of solver-executable code, producing a hybrid reasoning
trace in which critical derivations are expressed in formal language. To teach
this behavior at scale, we combine (1) supervised fine-tuning on an 11K newly
developed synthetic dataset with interleaved natural language reasoning and
automatic formalization, and (2) solver-in-the-loop reinforcement learning that
jointly optimizes both the CoT narrative and the resulting program through
outcome-based rewards. Built on Qwen2.5-VL-7B, our new model, named
GF-Reasoner, achieves up to 15% accuracy improvements on standard GPS
benchmarks, surpassing both 7B-scale peers and the much larger model
Qwen2.5-VL-72B. By exploiting high-order geometric knowledge and offloading
symbolic computation to the solver, the generated reasoning traces are
noticeably shorter and cleaner. Furthermore, we present a comprehensive
analysis of method design choices (e.g., reasoning paradigms, data synthesis,
training epochs, etc.), providing actionable insights for future research.

*Shreyas Bhat Brahmavar,Yang Li,Junier Oliva*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ASPIRE是一个通用的神经推理模型，用于异构结构化数据的语义推理和预测，能够处理不同数据集的特征依赖关系，无需额外调优即可泛化到新任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界数据通常具有多样化和不连贯的形式，如不同的模式、不一致的语义和无固定特征顺序，这使得构建通用模型以跨数据集利用信息具有挑战性。

Method: ASPIRE结合了基于集合的、排列不变的Transformer和语义基础模块，利用自然语言描述、数据集元数据和上下文示例来学习跨数据集特征依赖关系。

Result: ASPIRE在多样化基准测试中表现优异，并支持在开放世界设置中成本感知的主动特征获取。

Conclusion: ASPIRE为实现真正通用的、语义感知的结构化数据推理迈出了一步。

Abstract: Real-world data often appears in diverse, disjoint forms -- with varying
schemas, inconsistent semantics, and no fixed feature ordering -- making it
challenging to build general-purpose models that can leverage information
across datasets. We introduce ASPIRE, Arbitrary Set-based Permutation-Invariant
Reasoning Engine, a Universal Neural Inference model for semantic reasoning and
prediction over heterogeneous structured data. ASPIRE combines a
permutation-invariant, set-based Transformer with a semantic grounding module
that incorporates natural language descriptions, dataset metadata, and
in-context examples to learn cross-dataset feature dependencies. This
architecture allows ASPIRE to ingest arbitrary sets of feature--value pairs and
support examples, align semantics across disjoint tables, and make predictions
for any specified target. Once trained, ASPIRE generalizes to new inference
tasks without additional tuning. In addition to delivering strong results
across diverse benchmarks, ASPIRE naturally supports cost-aware active feature
acquisition in an open-world setting, selecting informative features under
test-time budget constraints for an arbitrary unseen dataset. These
capabilities position ASPIRE as a step toward truly universal, semantics-aware
inference over structured data.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于掩码的分类器校准方法MaC-Cal，通过随机稀疏性提升置信度与准确性的对齐，解决了深度神经网络校准不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在安全关键场景中因校准不足可能导致严重后果，现有方法多忽略欠置信问题。

Method: 采用两阶段训练方案和自适应稀疏性，动态调整掩码保留率以匹配置信度与准确性。

Result: 实验表明MaC-Cal在校准性能和数据损坏下的鲁棒性上表现优异。

Conclusion: MaC-Cal为深度神经网络提供了可靠置信度估计的实用解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown competitive results
in many fields. Despite this success, they often suffer from poor calibration,
especially in safety-critical scenarios such as autonomous driving and
healthcare, where unreliable confidence estimates can lead to serious
consequences. Recent studies have focused on improving calibration by modifying
the classifier, yet such efforts remain limited. Moreover, most existing
approaches overlook calibration errors caused by underconfidence, which can be
equally detrimental. To address these challenges, we propose MaC-Cal, a novel
mask-based classifier calibration method that leverages stochastic sparsity to
enhance the alignment between confidence and accuracy. MaC-Cal adopts a
two-stage training scheme with adaptive sparsity, dynamically adjusting mask
retention rates based on the deviation between confidence and accuracy.
Extensive experiments show that MaC-Cal achieves superior calibration
performance and robustness under data corruption, offering a practical and
effective solution for reliable confidence estimation in DNNs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手术错误检测方法因数据不足和方法限制难以应对机器人辅助手术的复杂挑战。

Method: 构建MERP数据集，提出CARES框架，采用多级专家协同推理和风险分层提示生成。

Result: 在RARP和MERP数据集上分别达到54.3和52.0 mF1，优于现有零样本方法14%。

Conclusion: CARES框架结合临床推理，无需训练即可高效检测手术错误，数据集和代码将公开。

Abstract: Robotic-assisted surgery (RAS) introduces complex challenges that current
surgical error detection methods struggle to address effectively due to limited
training data and methodological constraints. Therefore, we construct MERP
(Multi-class Error in Robotic Prostatectomy), a comprehensive dataset for error
detection in robotic prostatectomy with frame-level annotations featuring six
clinically aligned error categories. In addition, we propose CARES
(Collaborative Agentic Reasoning for Error Detection in Surgery), a novel
zero-shot clinically-informed and risk-stratified agentic reasoning
architecture for multi-class surgical error detection. CARES implements
adaptive generation of medically informed, error-specific Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) prompts across multiple expertise levels. The framework employs
risk-aware routing to assign error task to expertise-matched reasoning pathways
based on complexity and clinical impact. Subsequently, each pathway decomposes
surgical error analysis into three specialized agents with temporal, spatial,
and procedural analysis. Each agent analyzes using dynamically selected prompts
tailored to the assigned expertise level and error type, generating detailed
and transparent reasoning traces. By incorporating clinically informed
reasoning from established surgical assessment guidelines, CARES enables
zero-shot surgical error detection without prior training. Evaluation
demonstrates superior performance with 54.3 mF1 on RARP and 52.0 mF1 on MERP
datasets, outperforming existing zero-shot approaches by up to 14% while
remaining competitive with trained models. Ablation studies demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method. The dataset and code will be publicly available.

TL;DR: MARTA是一个多智能体强化学习框架，旨在通过对抗训练使智能体在部分故障时仍能高效协作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多智能体系统中因组件故障导致的性能下降问题。

Method: 提出MARTA框架，通过对抗性马尔可夫游戏训练智能体应对最坏故障。

Result: 理论证明收敛性，实验显示在多个基准环境中表现优异。

Conclusion: MARTA为多智能体系统提供了高效的故障容忍解决方案。

Abstract: In multi-agent systems, the safe and reliable execution of tasks often
depends on agents correctly coordinating their actions. However, in real-world
deployments, failures of computational components are inevitable, presenting a
critical challenge: ensuring that multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)
policies remain effective even when some agents malfunction. We propose the
Multi-Agent Robust Training Algorithm (MARTA), a plug-and-play framework for
training MARL agents to be resilient to potentially severe faults. MARTA
operates in cooperative multi-agent settings where agents may lose the ability
to execute their intended actions. It learns to identify failure scenarios that
are especially detrimental to system performance and equips agents with
strategies to mitigate their impact. At the heart of MARTA is a novel
adversarial Markov game in which an adversary -- modelled via \emph{Markov
switching controls} -- learns to disable agents in high-risk state regions,
while the remaining agents are trained to \emph{jointly} best-respond to such
targeted malfunctions. To ensure practicality, MARTA enforces a malfunction
budget, constraining the adversary to a fixed number of failures and learning
robust policies accordingly. We provide theoretical guarantees that MARTA
converges to a Markov perfect equilibrium, ensuring agents optimally counteract
worst-case faults. Empirically, we show that MARTA achieves state-of-the-art
fault-tolerant performance across benchmark environments, including Multi-Agent
Particle World and Level-Based Foraging.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体上多媒体内容的激增导致虚假信息快速传播，尤其是在危机事件中，亟需强大的验证工具。

Method: 开发了一个统一的验证流程，结合视觉取证、文本分析和多模态推理，通过语义相似性、时间对齐和地理定位检测上下文不匹配的媒体。

Result: 在ACM Multimedia 2025 Grand Challenge基准测试中表现出色，适用于多样化的现实场景。

Conclusion: 该系统推动了多媒体验证技术的进步，为记者、事实核查者和研究人员提供了实用工具。

Abstract: The proliferation of multimedia content on social media platforms has
dramatically transformed how information is consumed and disseminated. While
this shift enables real-time coverage of global events, it also facilitates the
rapid spread of misinformation and disinformation, especially during crises
such as wars, natural disasters, or elections. The rise of synthetic media and
the reuse of authentic content in misleading contexts have intensified the need
for robust multimedia verification tools. In this paper, we present a
comprehensive system developed for the ACM Multimedia 2025 Grand Challenge on
Multimedia Verification. Our system assesses the authenticity and contextual
accuracy of multimedia content in multilingual settings and generates both
expert-oriented verification reports and accessible summaries for the general
public. We introduce a unified verification pipeline that integrates visual
forensics, textual analysis, and multimodal reasoning, and propose a hybrid
approach to detect out-of-context (OOC) media through semantic similarity,
temporal alignment, and geolocation cues. Extensive evaluations on the Grand
Challenge benchmark demonstrate the system's effectiveness across diverse
real-world scenarios. Our contributions advance the state of the art in
multimedia verification and offer practical tools for journalists,
fact-checkers, and researchers confronting information integrity challenges in
the digital age.

*Kamran Akbar,Robert Bregovic,Federica Battisti*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于光场显示深度感知的场景复杂度（DASC）指标，用于评估3D内容在光场显示中的表现，并通过主观研究预测用户偏好的模糊程度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 光场显示在3D沉浸式可视化中存在深度范围限制，导致内容在屏幕外区域出现伪影。现有方法通过模糊处理缓解问题，但会丢失细节。

Method: 提出DASC指标，结合几何和位置因素评估3D内容；通过主观研究分析用户对不同模糊程度的偏好。

Result: 基于主观研究结果，提出模型预测用户偏好的模糊程度。

Conclusion: DASC指标和预测模型有助于优化光场显示中3D内容的渲染质量。

Abstract: Light field display is one of the technologies providing 3D immersive
visualization. However, a light field display generates only a limited number
of light rays which results in finite angular and spatial resolutions.
Therefore, 3D content can be shown with high quality only within a narrow depth
range notated as Depth of Field (DoF) around the display screen. Outside this
range, due to the appearance of aliasing artifacts, the quality degrades
proportionally to the distance from the screen. One solution to mitigate the
artifacts is depth of field rendering which blurs the content in the distorted
regions, but can result in the removal of scene details. This research focuses
on proposing a DoF Aware Scene Complexity (DASC) metric that characterizes 3D
content based on geometrical and positional factors considering the light field
display's DoF. In this research, we also evaluate the observers' preference
across different level of blurriness caused by DoF rendering ranging from
sharp, aliased scenes to overly smoothed alias-free scenes. We have conducted
this study over multiple scenes that we created to account for different types
of content. Based on the outcome of subjective studies, we propose a model that
takes the value of DASC metric as input and predicts the preferred level of
blurring for the given scene as output.

Motivation: 解决人形机器人执行高动态动作（如杂技）的挑战，避免传统线性化和模型近似方法的性能下降问题。

Method: 采用轨迹优化和全身控制结合的架构，中间通过匹配模型抽象处理复杂动力学方程。

Result: 在仿真中验证了系统执行高动态动作（包括约束和姿态行为）的有效性。

Conclusion: 该架构成功解决了复杂动力学方程下的高动态动作执行问题，为人形机器人提供了更高效的规划和控制方法。

Abstract: Endowing humanoid robots with the ability to perform highly dynamic motions
akin to human-level acrobatics has been a long-standing challenge. Successfully
performing these maneuvers requires close consideration of the underlying
physics in both trajectory optimization for planning and control during
execution. This is particularly challenging due to humanoids' high
degree-of-freedom count and associated exponentially scaling complexities,
which makes planning on the explicit equations of motion intractable. Typical
workarounds include linearization methods and model approximations. However,
neither are sufficient because they produce degraded performance on the true
robotic system. This paper presents a control architecture comprising
trajectory optimization and whole-body control, intermediated by a matching
model abstraction, that enables the execution of acrobatic maneuvers, including
constraint and posture behaviors, conditioned on the unabbreviated equations of
motion of the articulated rigid body model. A review of underlying modeling and
control methods is given, followed by implementation details including model
abstraction, trajectory optimization and whole-body controller. The system's
effectiveness is analyzed in simulation.

Motivation: 在线优化控制四足机器人需要适应实时变化的输入和条件，但传统LMPC的线性化模型可能不准确。

Method: 利用Koopman算子在保留非线性运动方程特性的高维空间中构建线性模型，并应用LMPC。

Result: 实现了四足机器人的高精度跟踪和抗干扰能力。

Conclusion: 这是首次将Koopman算子理论应用于四足机器人LMPC的研究。

Abstract: Online optimal control of quadruped robots would enable them to adapt to
varying inputs and changing conditions in real time. A common way of achieving
this is linear model predictive control (LMPC), where a quadratic programming
(QP) problem is formulated over a finite horizon with a quadratic cost and
linear constraints obtained by linearizing the equations of motion and solved
on the fly. However, the model linearization may lead to model inaccuracies. In
this paper, we use the Koopman operator to create a linear model of the
quadrupedal system in high dimensional space which preserves the nonlinearity
of the equations of motion. Then using LMPC, we demonstrate high fidelity
tracking and disturbance rejection on a quadrupedal robot. This is the first
work that uses the Koopman operator theory for LMPC of quadrupedal locomotion.

Motivation: 现有模型（如Vicsek、Cucker-Smale）缺乏碰撞避免，而Olfati-Saber模型过于刚性，限制了其在群体机器人中的应用。

Method: 基于相对位置、速度和局部密度设计模型，引入空间偏移和动力学偏移两个可调参数。

Result: 模型实现了空间灵活、无碰撞的群体行为，并能通过自适应参数调整实现群体与集群的相变。

Conclusion: 该模型为多机器人系统（如自主空中群体）提供了实用且鲁棒的基础。

Abstract: Collective behaviors such as swarming and flocking emerge from simple,
decentralized interactions in biological systems. Existing models, such as
Vicsek and Cucker-Smale, lack collision avoidance, whereas the Olfati-Saber
model imposes rigid formations, limiting their applicability in swarm robotics.
To address these limitations, this paper proposes a minimal yet expressive
model that governs agent dynamics using relative positions, velocities, and
local density, modulated by two tunable parameters: the spatial offset and
kinetic offset. The model achieves spatially flexible, collision-free behaviors
that reflect naturalistic group dynamics. Furthermore, we extend the framework
to cognitive autonomous systems, enabling energy-aware phase transitions
between swarming and flocking through adaptive control parameter tuning. This
cognitively inspired approach offers a robust foundation for real-world
applications in multi-robot systems, particularly autonomous aerial swarms.

Result: 在对称和高密度场景中，eIFP-MPC显著减少振荡，确保无碰撞运动，并提高轨迹效率。

Conclusion: 几何规划器通过优化可以在复杂多智能体环境中实现稳健的大规模性能。

Abstract: The Iterative Forecast Planner (IFP) is a geometric planning approach that
offers lightweight computations, scalable, and reactive solutions for
multi-robot path planning in decentralized, communication-free settings.
However, it struggles in symmetric configurations, where mirrored interactions
often lead to collisions and deadlocks. We introduce eIFP-MPC, an optimized and
extended version of IFP that improves robustness and path consistency in dense,
dynamic environments. The method refines threat prioritization using a
time-to-collision heuristic, stabilizes path generation through cost-based
via-point selection, and ensures dynamic feasibility by incorporating model
predictive control (MPC) into the planning process. These enhancements are
tightly integrated into the IFP to preserve its efficiency while improving its
adaptability and stability. Extensive simulations across symmetric and
high-density scenarios show that eIFP-MPC significantly reduces oscillations,
ensures collision-free motion, and improves trajectory efficiency. The results
demonstrate that geometric planners can be strengthened through optimization,
enabling robust performance at scale in complex multi-agent environments.

Motivation: 肌腱驱动机械手缺乏直接的运动捕捉数据与肌腱控制的一对一映射，且视觉跟踪方法易受遮挡和误差影响，sEMG传感器提供了一种替代方案，但现有方法在映射sEMG信号到肌腱控制方面仍存在挑战。

Method: 扩展了emg2pose数据集，包含193名受试者的370小时数据，29种手势，并引入肌腱控制信号。提出了三种基线回归模型和一种基于扩散的回归模型。

Result: 新数据集和模型框架为肌腱驱动机械手的精确控制提供了基础，解决了无效姿势等问题。

Conclusion: 该研究为肌腱驱动机械手的可扩展和精确控制奠定了基础，推动了灵巧机械手操作的发展。

Abstract: Tendon-driven robotic hands offer unparalleled dexterity for manipulation
tasks, but learning control policies for such systems presents unique
challenges. Unlike joint-actuated robotic hands, tendon-driven systems lack a
direct one-to-one mapping between motion capture (mocap) data and tendon
controls, making the learning process complex and expensive. Additionally,
visual tracking methods for real-world applications are prone to occlusions and
inaccuracies, further complicating joint tracking. Wrist-wearable surface
electromyography (sEMG) sensors present an inexpensive, robust alternative to
capture hand motion. However, mapping sEMG signals to tendon control remains a
significant challenge despite the availability of EMG-to-pose data sets and
regression-based models in the existing literature.
  We introduce the first large-scale EMG-to-Tendon Control dataset for robotic
hands, extending the emg2pose dataset, which includes recordings from 193
subjects, spanning 370 hours and 29 stages with diverse gestures. This dataset
incorporates tendon control signals derived using the MyoSuite MyoHand model,
addressing limitations such as invalid poses in prior methods. We provide three
baseline regression models to demonstrate emg2tendon utility and propose a
novel diffusion-based regression model for predicting tendon control from sEMG
recordings. This dataset and modeling framework marks a significant step
forward for tendon-driven dexterous robotic manipulation, laying the groundwork
for scalable and accurate tendon control in robotic hands.

Abstract: We introduce DeepFleet, a suite of foundation models designed to support
coordination and planning for large-scale mobile robot fleets. These models are
trained on fleet movement data, including robot positions, goals, and
interactions, from hundreds of thousands of robots in Amazon warehouses
worldwide. DeepFleet consists of four architectures that each embody a distinct
inductive bias and collectively explore key points in the design space for
multi-agent foundation models: the robot-centric (RC) model is an
autoregressive decision transformer operating on neighborhoods of individual
robots; the robot-floor (RF) model uses a transformer with cross-attention
between robots and the warehouse floor; the image-floor (IF) model applies
convolutional encoding to a multi-channel image representation of the full
fleet; and the graph-floor (GF) model combines temporal attention with graph
neural networks for spatial relationships. In this paper, we describe these
models and present our evaluation of the impact of these design choices on
prediction task performance. We find that the robot-centric and graph-floor
models, which both use asynchronous robot state updates and incorporate the
localized structure of robot interactions, show the most promise. We also
present experiments that show that these two models can make effective use of
larger warehouses operation datasets as the models are scaled up.

Conclusion: DQ-Net在动态物体抓取任务中表现鲁棒，为动态场景提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Quadrupedal robots with manipulators offer strong mobility and adaptability
for grasping in unstructured, dynamic environments through coordinated
whole-body control. However, existing research has predominantly focused on
static-object grasping, neglecting the challenges posed by dynamic targets and
thus limiting applicability in dynamic scenarios such as logistics sorting and
human-robot collaboration. To address this, we introduce DQ-Bench, a new
benchmark that systematically evaluates dynamic grasping across varying object
motions, velocities, heights, object types, and terrain complexities, along
with comprehensive evaluation metrics. Building upon this benchmark, we propose
DQ-Net, a compact teacher-student framework designed to infer grasp
configurations from limited perceptual cues. During training, the teacher
network leverages privileged information to holistically model both the static
geometric properties and dynamic motion characteristics of the target, and
integrates a grasp fusion module to deliver robust guidance for motion
planning. Concurrently, we design a lightweight student network that performs
dual-viewpoint temporal modeling using only the target mask, depth map, and
proprioceptive state, enabling closed-loop action outputs without reliance on
privileged data. Extensive experiments on DQ-Bench demonstrate that DQ-Net
achieves robust dynamic objects grasping across multiple task settings,
substantially outperforming baseline methods in both success rate and
responsiveness.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: AZRA是一个增强现实框架，旨在提升动物形态机器人与用户之间的情感互动能力，无需物理改造。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动物形态机器人作为宠物替代品的潜力受限于简单且短暂的情感互动。

Method: 通过AR技术扩展机器人的情感表现（如面部、灯光、声音、思维气泡）和交互方式（如语音、触摸、接近、注视），并引入情感计算模型。

Result: AZRA成功增强了Petit Qoobo机器人的情感互动能力，展示了快速原型设计和现有机器人增强的潜力。

Conclusion: AZRA为未来动物形态机器人的开发提供了新的方向，强调了情感互动的重要性。

Abstract: Zoomorphic robots could serve as accessible and practical alternatives for
users unable or unwilling to keep pets. However, their affective interactions
are often simplistic and short-lived, limiting their potential for domestic
adoption. In order to facilitate more dynamic and nuanced affective
interactions and relationships between users and zoomorphic robots we present
AZRA, a novel augmented reality (AR) framework that extends the affective
capabilities of these robots without physical modifications. To demonstrate
AZRA, we augment a zoomorphic robot, Petit Qoobo, with novel emotional displays
(face, light, sound, thought bubbles) and interaction modalities (voice, touch,
proximity, gaze). Additionally, AZRA features a computational model of emotion
to calculate the robot's emotional responses, daily moods, evolving personality
and needs. We highlight how AZRA can be used for rapid participatory
prototyping and enhancing existing robots, then discuss implications on future
zoomorphic robot development.

Abstract: This paper presents the development of a calibrated digital twin of a wheel
loader. A calibrated digital twin integrates a construction vehicle with a
high-fidelity digital model allowing for automated diagnostics and optimization
of operations as well as pre-planning simulations enhancing automation
capabilities. The high-fidelity digital model is a virtual twin of the physical
wheel loader. It uses a physics-based multibody dynamic model of the wheel
loader in the software AGX Dynamics. Interactions of the wheel loader's bucket
while in use in construction can be simulated in the virtual model. Calibration
makes this simulation of high-fidelity which can enhance realistic planning for
automation of construction operations. In this work, a wheel loader was
instrumented with several sensors used to calibrate the digital model. The
calibrated digital twin was able to estimate the magnitude of the forces on the
bucket base with high accuracy, providing a high-fidelity simulation.

Arduino microcontroller and real sense camera to perform computer vision to
detect plants using real-time YOLOv5 with the Pl@ntNet-300K dataset. The robot
uses LIDAR for object and collision avoideance and does not need to move on a
pre-defined path and can keep track of which plants it has watered. We provide
the Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) Table, forward kinematics, differential driving
kinematics, and inverse kinematics along with simulation and experiment results

Motivation: 解决机器人混合现实系统中因上传高分辨率图像导致的通信成本高的问题。

Result: 实验表明，GSMR和GSCLO在多种场景和机器人类型上显著优于现有基准，首次实现了超低通信成本的RoboMR。

Conclusion: GSMR和GSCLO为动态场景中的机器人混合现实提供了高效、低成本的解决方案，且混合数据有助于提升高斯泼溅性能。

Abstract: Realizing low-cost communication in robotic mixed reality (RoboMR) systems
presents a challenge, due to the necessity of uploading high-resolution images
through wireless channels. This paper proposes Gaussian splatting (GS) RoboMR
(GSMR), which enables the simulator to opportunistically render a
photo-realistic view from the robot's pose by calling ``memory'' from a GS
model, thus reducing the need for excessive image uploads. However, the GS
model may involve discrepancies compared to the actual environments. To this
end, a GS cross-layer optimization (GSCLO) framework is further proposed, which
jointly optimizes content switching (i.e., deciding whether to upload image or
not) and power allocation (i.e., adjusting to content profiles) across
different frames by minimizing a newly derived GSMR loss function. The GSCLO
problem is addressed by an accelerated penalty optimization (APO) algorithm
that reduces computational complexity by over $10$x compared to traditional
branch-and-bound and search algorithms. Moreover, variants of GSCLO are
presented to achieve robust, low-power, and multi-robot GSMR. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed GSMR paradigm and GSCLO method
achieve significant improvements over existing benchmarks on both wheeled and
legged robots in terms of diverse metrics in various scenarios. For the first
time, it is found that RoboMR can be achieved with ultra-low communication
costs, and mixture of data is useful for enhancing GS performance in dynamic
scenarios.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial-aquatic vehicles (UAAVs) can operate both in the air and
underwater, giving them broad application prospects. Inspired by the
dual-function wings of puffins, we propose a UAAV with amphibious wings to
address the challenge posed by medium differences on the vehicle's propulsion
system. The amphibious wing, redesigned based on a fixed-wing structure,
features a single degree of freedom in pitch and requires no additional
components. It can generate lift in the air and function as a flapping wing for
propulsion underwater, reducing disturbance to marine life and making it
environmentally friendly. Additionally, an artificial central pattern generator
(CPG) is introduced to enhance the smoothness of the flapping motion. This
paper presents the prototype, design details, and practical implementation of
this concept.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: OmniVTLA是一种新型视觉-语言-动作（VLA）模型，通过引入触觉感知解决了现有模型在接触密集型任务中的不足。其核心贡献包括双路径触觉编码器框架、ObjTac数据集和语义对齐的触觉编码器，实验表明其在抓取任务中显著优于现有VLA模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VLA模型因触觉传感器的异质性和数据获取困难而忽视触觉感知，导致在接触密集型任务中表现不佳。

Method: 提出OmniVTLA架构，包括双路径触觉编码器框架（结合ViT和SA-ViT）、构建ObjTac数据集（包含135K三模态样本），并训练语义对齐的触觉编码器。

Result: 在真实实验中，OmniVTLA在抓取任务中成功率显著提升（夹持器96.9%，灵巧手100%），任务完成时间缩短，轨迹更平滑。

Conclusion: OmniVTLA通过触觉感知显著提升了VLA模型的性能，尤其在接触密集型任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models build upon vision-language
foundations, and have achieved promising results and exhibit the possibility of
task generalization in robot manipulation. However, due to the heterogeneity of
tactile sensors and the difficulty of acquiring tactile data, current VLA
models significantly overlook the importance of tactile perception and fail in
contact-rich tasks. To address this issue, this paper proposes OmniVTLA, a
novel architecture involving tactile sensing. Specifically, our contributions
are threefold. First, our OmniVTLA features a dual-path tactile encoder
framework. This framework enhances tactile perception across diverse
vision-based and force-based tactile sensors by using a pretrained vision
transformer (ViT) and a semantically-aligned tactile ViT (SA-ViT). Second, we
introduce ObjTac, a comprehensive force-based tactile dataset capturing
textual, visual, and tactile information for 56 objects across 10 categories.
With 135K tri-modal samples, ObjTac supplements existing visuo-tactile
datasets. Third, leveraging this dataset, we train a semantically-aligned
tactile encoder to learn a unified tactile representation, serving as a better
initialization for OmniVTLA. Real-world experiments demonstrate substantial
improvements over state-of-the-art VLA baselines, achieving 96.9% success rates
with grippers, (21.9% higher over baseline) and 100% success rates with
dexterous hands (6.2% higher over baseline) in pick-and-place tasks. Besides,
OmniVTLA significantly reduces task completion time and generates smoother
trajectories through tactile sensing compared to existing VLA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度生成模型在模仿学习中生成的动作安全性不足，尤其在复杂障碍环境中。

Method: 提出PF2MP，通过势场引导流匹配，从示范中学习任务策略和障碍信息。

Result: 实验表明PF2MP显著减少碰撞，提升安全性，且不影响任务成功率。

Conclusion: PF2MP为复杂环境中的安全动作生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Deep generative models, particularly diffusion and flow matching models, have
recently shown remarkable potential in learning complex policies through
imitation learning. However, the safety of generated motions remains
overlooked, particularly in complex environments with inherent obstacles. In
this work, we address this critical gap by proposing Potential Field-Guided
Flow Matching Policy (PF2MP), a novel approach that simultaneously learns task
policies and extracts obstacle-related information, represented as a potential
field, from the same set of successful demonstrations. During inference, PF2MP
modulates the flow matching vector field via the learned potential field,
enabling safe motion generation. By leveraging these complementary fields, our
approach achieves improved safety without compromising task success across
diverse environments, such as navigation tasks and robotic manipulation
scenarios. We evaluate PF2MP in both simulation and real-world settings,
demonstrating its effectiveness in task space and joint space control.
Experimental results demonstrate that PF2MP enhances safety, achieving a
significant reduction of collisions compared to baseline policies. This work
paves the way for safer motion generation in unstructured and obstaclerich
environments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出一种新框架，通过最大化潜在动作与真实动作的互信息，直接从无标签视频演示中学习，提升策略性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于演示的学习需要大量带标签的专家轨迹，限制了训练数据规模。直接从无标签视频学习是一种有前景的替代方案，但现有方法提取的潜在动作与真实动作互信息不足，导致控制性能不佳。

Method: 引入变分信息瓶颈，显式最大化潜在动作与真实动作的互信息，即使没有动作标签。

Result: 理论分析证明目标函数确实最大化互信息。实验在仿真和真实机器人平台上验证了方法的有效性，显著提升了互信息和策略性能。

Conclusion: 新框架通过最大化互信息，直接从无标签视频中学习，显著提升了控制性能。

Abstract: Learning from demonstrations (LfD) typically relies on large amounts of
action-labeled expert trajectories, which fundamentally constrains the scale of
available training data. A promising alternative is to learn directly from
unlabeled video demonstrations. However, we find that existing methods tend to
encode latent actions that share little mutual information with the true robot
actions, leading to suboptimal control performance. To address this limitation,
we introduce a novel framework that explicitly maximizes the mutual information
between latent actions and true actions, even in the absence of action labels.
Our method leverage the variational information-bottleneck to extract
action-relevant representations while discarding task-irrelevant information.
We provide a theoretical analysis showing that our objective indeed maximizes
the mutual information between latent and true actions. Finally, we validate
our approach through extensive experiments: first in simulated robotic
environments and then on real-world robotic platforms, the experimental results
demonstrate that our method significantly enhances mutual information and
consistently improves policy performance.

Result: 实验表明，该方法提高了抓取成功率和适应性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在零售环境中表现出优越的抓取性能和适应性。

Abstract: Robotic pick-and-place tasks in convenience stores pose challenges due to
dense object arrangements, occlusions, and variations in object properties such
as color, shape, size, and texture. These factors complicate trajectory
planning and grasping. This paper introduces a perception-action pipeline
leveraging annotation-guided visual prompting, where bounding box annotations
identify both pickable objects and placement locations, providing structured
spatial guidance. Instead of traditional step-by-step planning, we employ
Action Chunking with Transformers (ACT) as an imitation learning algorithm,
enabling the robotic arm to predict chunked action sequences from human
demonstrations. This facilitates smooth, adaptive, and data-driven
pick-and-place operations. We evaluate our system based on success rate and
visual analysis of grasping behavior, demonstrating improved grasp accuracy and
adaptability in retail environments.

Result: 机器人行为可能影响发言时间，但未显著差异，且上级满意度未降低。

Conclusion: 机器人干预可能抑制上级主导，促进讨论平等。

Abstract: This study investigated whether robotic agents that deal with social
hierarchical relationships can reduce the dominance of superiors and equalize
participation among participants in discussions with hierarchical structures.
Thirty doctors and students having hierarchical relationship were gathered as
participants, and an intervention experiment was conducted using a robot that
can encourage participants to speak depending on social hierarchy. These were
compared with strategies that intervened equally for all participants without
considering hierarchy and with a no-action. The robots performed follow
actions, showing backchanneling to speech, and encourage actions, prompting
speech from members with less speaking time, on the basis of the hierarchical
relationships among group members to equalize participation. The experimental
results revealed that the robot's actions could potentially influence the
speaking time among members, but it could not be conclusively stated that there
were significant differences between the robot's action conditions. However,
the results suggested that it might be possible to influence speaking time
without decreasing the satisfaction of superiors. This indicates that in
discussion scenarios where experienced superiors are likely to dominate,
controlling the robot's backchanneling behavior could potentially suppress
dominance and equalize participation among group members.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法过于关注低级抓取稳定性，忽视了功能感知定位和类人姿势对后续操作的重要性。

Method: AffordDex采用两阶段训练：第一阶段预训练轨迹模仿器学习人类手部运动先验；第二阶段通过残差模块和负功能感知分割（NAA）模块优化抓取策略。

Result: AffordDex在已知物体、未知实例和新类别上均显著优于现有方法，抓取姿势更类人且功能更合理。

Conclusion: AffordDex通过结合运动先验和功能感知，实现了通用且高效的灵巧抓取。

Abstract: A dexterous hand capable of generalizable grasping objects is fundamental for
the development of general-purpose embodied AI. However, previous methods focus
narrowly on low-level grasp stability metrics, neglecting affordance-aware
positioning and human-like poses which are crucial for downstream manipulation.
To address these limitations, we propose AffordDex, a novel framework with
two-stage training that learns a universal grasping policy with an inherent
understanding of both motion priors and object affordances. In the first stage,
a trajectory imitator is pre-trained on a large corpus of human hand motions to
instill a strong prior for natural movement. In the second stage, a residual
module is trained to adapt these general human-like motions to specific object
instances. This refinement is critically guided by two components: our Negative
Affordance-aware Segmentation (NAA) module, which identifies functionally
inappropriate contact regions, and a privileged teacher-student distillation
process that ensures the final vision-based policy is highly successful.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that AffordDex not only achieves universal
dexterous grasping but also remains remarkably human-like in posture and
functionally appropriate in contact location. As a result, AffordDex
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across seen objects,
unseen instances, and even entirely novel categories.

Result: SDAX使机器人掌握了爬行、攀爬、跳跃等敏捷行为，并在真实硬件上成功部署。

Conclusion: SDAX显著减少了人工工程需求，实现了高效探索和实际应用。

Abstract: Exploration is crucial for enabling legged robots to learn agile locomotion
behaviors that can overcome diverse obstacles. However, such exploration is
inherently challenging, and we often rely on extensive reward engineering,
expert demonstrations, or curriculum learning - all of which limit
generalizability. In this work, we propose Skill Discovery as Exploration
(SDAX), a novel learning framework that significantly reduces human engineering
effort. SDAX leverages unsupervised skill discovery to autonomously acquire a
diverse repertoire of skills for overcoming obstacles. To dynamically regulate
the level of exploration during training, SDAX employs a bi-level optimization
process that autonomously adjusts the degree of exploration. We demonstrate
that SDAX enables quadrupedal robots to acquire highly agile behaviors
including crawling, climbing, leaping, and executing complex maneuvers such as
jumping off vertical walls. Finally, we deploy the learned policy on real
hardware, validating its successful transfer to the real world.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能够通过单一不完美的演示快速泛化到不同问题场景，而机器人通常需要大量示例且泛化能力有限。作者认为这是由于机器人无法恢复智能行为背后的潜在解释。

Method: RIR通过分层生成模型推断潜在程序结构，结合视觉语言模型和规划器进行贝叶斯程序归纳，生成可执行程序。

Result: 在连续操作任务上，RIR仅需一个演示即可推断任务结构并泛化到新场景，性能优于现有视觉语言模型基线。

Conclusion: RIR框架通过推断潜在程序结构，显著提升了机器人在少量演示下的学习和泛化能力。

Abstract: Humans can observe a single, imperfect demonstration and immediately
generalize to very different problem settings. Robots, in contrast, often
require hundreds of examples and still struggle to generalize beyond the
training conditions. We argue that this limitation arises from the inability to
recover the latent explanations that underpin intelligent behavior, and that
these explanations can take the form of structured programs consisting of
high-level goals, sub-task decomposition, and execution constraints. In this
work, we introduce Rational Inverse Reasoning (RIR), a framework for inferring
these latent programs through a hierarchical generative model of behavior. RIR
frames few-shot imitation as Bayesian program induction: a vision-language
model iteratively proposes structured symbolic task hypotheses, while a
planner-in-the-loop inference scheme scores each by the likelihood of the
observed demonstration under that hypothesis. This loop yields a posterior over
concise, executable programs. We evaluate RIR on a suite of continuous
manipulation tasks designed to test one-shot and few-shot generalization across
variations in object pose, count, geometry, and layout. With as little as one
demonstration, RIR infers the intended task structure and generalizes to novel
settings, outperforming state-of-the-art vision-language model baselines.

Abstract: Expressive behaviors in robots are critical for effectively conveying their
emotional states during interactions with humans. In this work, we present a
framework that autonomously generates realistic and diverse robotic emotional
expressions based on expert human demonstrations captured in Mixed Reality
(MR). Our system enables experts to teleoperate a virtual robot from a
first-person perspective, capturing their facial expressions, head movements,
and upper-body gestures, and mapping these behaviors onto corresponding robotic
components including eyes, ears, neck, and arms. Leveraging a
flow-matching-based generative process, our model learns to produce coherent
and varied behaviors in real-time in response to moving objects, conditioned
explicitly on given emotional states. A preliminary test validated the
effectiveness of our approach for generating autonomous expressions.

Abstract: Bulk material handling involves the efficient and precise moving of large
quantities of materials, a core operation in many industries, including cargo
ship unloading, waste sorting, construction, and demolition. These repetitive,
labor-intensive, and safety-critical operations are typically performed using
large hydraulic material handlers equipped with underactuated grippers. In this
work, we present a comprehensive framework for the autonomous execution of
large-scale material handling tasks. The system integrates specialized modules
for environment perception, pile attack point selection, path planning, and
motion control. The main contributions of this work are two reinforcement
learning-based modules: an attack point planner that selects optimal grasping
locations on the material pile to maximize removal efficiency and minimize the
number of scoops, and a robust trajectory following controller that addresses
the precision and safety challenges associated with underactuated grippers in
movement, while utilizing their free-swinging nature to release material
through dynamic throwing. We validate our framework through real-world
experiments on a 40 t material handler in a representative worksite, focusing
on two key tasks: high-throughput bulk pile management and high-precision truck
loading. Comparative evaluations against human operators demonstrate the
system's effectiveness in terms of precision, repeatability, and operational
safety. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first complete automation of
material handling tasks on a full scale.

Method: GeoVLA结合视觉语言模型处理图像和语言指令，同时使用点云编码器提取3D几何信息，并通过空间感知动作专家生成精确动作序列。

Result: 在仿真和真实环境中，GeoVLA表现出卓越性能和鲁棒性，在LIBERO和ManiSkill2基准测试中达到最优结果。

Conclusion: GeoVLA通过整合3D信息显著提升了机器人的空间感知和动作预测能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a promising approach for
enabling robots to follow language instructions and predict corresponding
actions.However, current VLA models mainly rely on 2D visual inputs, neglecting
the rich geometric information in the 3D physical world, which limits their
spatial awareness and adaptability. In this paper, we present GeoVLA, a novel
VLA framework that effectively integrates 3D information to advance robotic
manipulation. It uses a vision-language model (VLM) to process images and
language instructions,extracting fused vision-language embeddings. In parallel,
it converts depth maps into point clouds and employs a customized point
encoder, called Point Embedding Network, to generate 3D geometric embeddings
independently. These produced embeddings are then concatenated and processed by
our proposed spatial-aware action expert, called 3D-enhanced Action Expert,
which combines information from different sensor modalities to produce precise
action sequences. Through extensive experiments in both simulation and
real-world environments, GeoVLA demonstrates superior performance and
robustness. It achieves state-of-the-art results in the LIBERO and ManiSkill2
simulation benchmarks and shows remarkable robustness in real-world tasks
requiring height adaptability, scale awareness and viewpoint invariance.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于AI的音视频语音增强系统（AVSE），比较了不同部署架构的性能，发现边缘辅助架构在延迟和语音质量间取得最佳平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究不同部署架构对音视频语音增强系统性能的影响，为实际应用提供优化指导。

Method: 使用CNN提取频谱特征，LSTM进行时序建模，通过多模态融合实现语音增强，并比较云端、边缘辅助和独立设备部署的性能。

Result: 云端部署质量最高，但边缘辅助架构在5G和Wi-Fi 6下能平衡延迟与语音质量，满足实时需求。

Conclusion: 研究结果为AVSE系统在不同应用场景中的部署和优化提供了实用指南。

Abstract: This paper introduces a new AI-based Audio-Visual Speech Enhancement (AVSE)
system and presents a comparative performance analysis of different deployment
architectures. The proposed AVSE system employs convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) for spectral feature extraction and long short-term memory (LSTM)
networks for temporal modeling, enabling robust speech enhancement through
multimodal fusion of audio and visual cues. Multiple deployment scenarios are
investigated, including cloud-based, edge-assisted, and standalone device
implementations. Their performance is evaluated in terms of speech quality
improvement, latency, and computational overhead. Real-world experiments are
conducted across various network conditions, including Ethernet, Wi-Fi, 4G, and
5G, to analyze the trade-offs between processing delay, communication latency,
and perceptual speech quality. The results show that while cloud deployment
achieves the highest enhancement quality, edge-assisted architectures offer the
best balance between latency and intelligibility, meeting real-time
requirements under 5G and Wi-Fi 6 conditions. These findings provide practical
guidelines for selecting and optimizing AVSE deployment architectures in
diverse applications, including assistive hearing devices, telepresence, and
industrial communications.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SSPO的方法，用于解决视频配音中源语言和目标语言时长不匹配的问题，通过分段采样和细粒度损失优化时长对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频配音中，由于语言信息密度不同，目标语音与源语音时长不匹配会导致音视频同步问题，影响观看体验。

Method: 采用Segment Supervised Preference Optimization (SSPO)方法，结合分段采样策略和细粒度损失函数，优化时长对齐。

Result: 实验结果表明，SSPO在时长对齐任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: SSPO方法有效解决了视频配音中的时长不匹配问题，提升了音视频同步效果。

Abstract: Video dubbing aims to translate original speech in visual media programs from
the source language to the target language, relying on neural machine
translation and text-to-speech technologies. Due to varying information
densities across languages, target speech often mismatches the source speech
duration, causing audio-video synchronization issues that significantly impact
viewer experience. In this study, we approach duration alignment in LLM-based
video dubbing machine translation as a preference optimization problem. We
propose the Segment Supervised Preference Optimization (SSPO) method, which
employs a segment-wise sampling strategy and fine-grained loss to mitigate
duration mismatches between source and target lines. Experimental results
demonstrate that SSPO achieves superior performance in duration alignment
tasks.

Method: 采用位置无关的点击声作为触发器，攻击50个目标说话人，并通过调整信噪比平衡隐蔽性和有效性。

Result: 多目标攻击成功率高达95.04%，在说话人验证任务中，目标与注册说话人相似度高时成功率可达90%。

Conclusion: 该方法在多目标攻击中表现出色，尤其在说话人相似度高时效果显著。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a multi-target backdoor attack against speaker
identification using position-independent clicking sounds as triggers. Unlike
previous single-target approaches, our method targets up to 50 speakers
simultaneously, achieving success rates of up to 95.04%. To simulate more
realistic attack conditions, we vary the signal-to-noise ratio between speech
and trigger, demonstrating a trade-off between stealth and effectiveness. We
further extend the attack to the speaker verification task by selecting the
most similar training speaker - based on cosine similarity - as the target. The
attack is most effective when target and enrolled speaker pairs are highly
similar, reaching success rates of up to 90% in such cases.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SonicRadiation的混合数值方法，用于解决复杂动态边界下的声辐射模拟问题，结合了TDBEM和FDTD的优势，提高了准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法（如基于幽灵单元的FDTD）在复杂边界下模拟声辐射时误差大或失败的问题。

Method: 提出了一种边界网格同步策略，将TDBEM与FDTD无缝结合，避免了幽灵单元的限制。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在复杂场景下的声辐射模拟中，准确性和效率均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SonicRadiation方法有效解决了复杂边界下的声辐射模拟问题，兼具TDBEM的准确性和FDTD的效率。

Abstract: Interactive synthesis of physical sound effects is crucial in digital media
production. Sound radiation simulation, a key component of physically based
sound synthesis, has posed challenges in the context of complex object
boundaries. Previous methods, such as ghost cell-based finite-difference
time-domain (FDTD) wave solver, have struggled to address these challenges,
leading to large errors and failures in complex boundaries because of the
limitation of ghost cells. We present SonicRadiation, a hybrid numerical
solution capable of handling complex and dynamic object boundaries in sound
radiation simulation without relying on ghost cells. We derive a consistent
formulation to connect the physical quantities on grid cells in FDTD with the
boundary elements in the time-domain boundary element method (TDBEM). Hereby,
we propose a boundary grid synchronization strategy to seamlessly integrate
TDBEM with FDTD while maintaining high numerical accuracy. Our method holds
both advantages from the accuracy of TDBEM for the near-field and the
efficiency of FDTD for the far-field. Experimental results demonstrate the
superiority of our method in sound radiation simulation over previous
approaches in terms of accuracy and efficiency, particularly in complex scenes,
further validating its effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究生成式AI音乐系统如何被宣传为民主化工具，但实际可能只是市场宣传，而非真正推动包容性。

Method: 结合自民族志和数字民族志，分析四款公开的生成式AI音乐系统（AIVA、Stable Audio、Suno、Udio）的宣传与用户反馈。

Result: 发现开发者和用户共享一种个人主义、全球主义和技术自由主义的意识形态，掩盖了音乐实践的真正变革。

Conclusion: 生成式AI音乐系统的意识形态模糊了个人责任，重塑了音乐的本质和实践。

Abstract: AI systems for music generation are increasingly common and easy to use,
granting people without any musical background the ability to create music.
Because of this, generative-AI has been marketed and celebrated as a means of
democratizing music making. However, inclusivity often functions as marketable
rhetoric rather than a genuine guiding principle in these industry settings. In
this paper, we look at four generative-AI music making systems available to the
public as of mid-2025 (AIVA, Stable Audio, Suno, and Udio) and track how they
are rhetoricized by their developers, and received by users. Our aim is to
investigate ideologies that are driving the early-stage development and
adoption of generative-AI in music making, with a particular focus on
democratization. A combination of autoethnography and digital ethnography is
used to examine patterns and incongruities in rhetoric when positioned against
product functionality. The results are then collated to develop a nuanced,
contextual discussion. The shared ideology we map between producers and
consumers is individualist, globalist, techno-liberal, and ethically evasive.
It is a 'total ideology' which obfuscates individual responsibility, and
through which the nature of music and musical practice is transfigured to suit
generative outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗领域对AI的需求增长迅速，但数据稀缺问题突出，尤其是在COVID-19疫情期间。合成数据被用于缓解这一问题，以快速提升模型性能。

Method: 使用CNN在Coughvid数据集上建立基线模型（72%准确率），然后通过ACGAN生成合成Mel频谱图数据，用于增强训练集。

Result: 合成数据使CNN分类器的测试准确率从72%提升至75%。

Conclusion: 合成数据在医疗AI中有潜力，但需注意训练中的不一致性并采取相应措施。

Abstract: One of the fastest-growing domains in AI is healthcare. Given its importance,
it has been the interest of many researchers to deploy ML models into the
ever-demanding healthcare domain to aid doctors and increase accessibility.
Delivering reliable models, however, demands a sizable amount of data, and the
recent COVID-19 pandemic served as a reminder of the rampant and scary nature
of healthcare that makes training models difficult. To alleviate such scarcity,
many published works attempted to synthesize radiological cough data to train
better COVID-19 detection models on the respective radiological data. To
accommodate the time sensitivity expected during a pandemic, this work focuses
on detecting COVID-19 through coughs using synthetic data to improve the
accuracy of the classifier. The work begins by training a CNN on a balanced
subset of the Coughvid dataset, establishing a baseline classification test
accuracy of 72%. The paper demonstrates how an Auxiliary Classification GAN
(ACGAN) may be trained to conditionally generate novel synthetic Mel
Spectrograms of both healthy and COVID-19 coughs. These coughs are used to
augment the training dataset of the CNN classifier, allowing it to reach a new
test accuracy of 75%. The work highlights the expected messiness and
inconsistency in training and offers insights into detecting and handling such
shortcomings.

TL;DR: QAMRO框架通过结合回归目标和感知差异优化，显著提升了音频生成系统的评估准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将MOS预测视为回归问题，但忽略了感知判断的相对性，导致评估不准确。

Method: 提出QAMRO框架，结合回归目标和自适应边际排序优化，利用预训练音频-文本模型（如CLAP和Audiobox-Aesthetics），并在AudioMOS Challenge 2025数据集上训练。

Result: QAMRO在所有维度上均显著优于基线模型，与人类评估更一致。

Conclusion: QAMRO通过多角度优化，有效解决了音频生成系统评估中的主观性和多维性问题。

Abstract: Evaluating audio generation systems, including text-to-music (TTM),
text-to-speech (TTS), and text-to-audio (TTA), remains challenging due to the
subjective and multi-dimensional nature of human perception. Existing methods
treat mean opinion score (MOS) prediction as a regression problem, but standard
regression losses overlook the relativity of perceptual judgments. To address
this limitation, we introduce QAMRO, a novel Quality-aware Adaptive Margin
Ranking Optimization framework that seamlessly integrates regression objectives
from different perspectives, aiming to highlight perceptual differences and
prioritize accurate ratings. Our framework leverages pre-trained audio-text
models such as CLAP and Audiobox-Aesthetics, and is trained exclusively on the
official AudioMOS Challenge 2025 dataset. It demonstrates superior alignment
with human evaluations across all dimensions, significantly outperforming
robust baseline models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展预训练大语言模型（LLMs）的语音能力面临模态差异和任务优化挑战，需要一种统一的方法。

Method: 提出USTokenizer提取高层语义信息，设计DualSpeechLM框架同时建模理解和生成任务，并引入语义监督损失和CoC策略。

Result: 实验表明，该方法有效促进理解和生成任务的互补关系，提升统一模型性能。

Conclusion: USTokenizer和DualSpeechLM为统一语音理解和生成提供了有前景的策略。

Abstract: Extending pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs)'s speech understanding or
generation abilities by introducing various effective speech tokens has
attracted great attention in the speech community. However, building a unified
speech understanding and generation model still faces the following challenges:
(1) Due to the huge modality gap between speech tokens and text tokens,
extending text LLMs to unified speech LLMs relies on large-scale paired data
for fine-tuning, and (2) Generation and understanding tasks prefer information
at different levels, e.g., generation benefits from detailed acoustic features,
while understanding favors high-level semantics. This divergence leads to
difficult performance optimization in one unified model. To solve these
challenges, in this paper, we present two key insights in speech tokenization
and speech language modeling. Specifically, we first propose an
Understanding-driven Speech Tokenizer (USTokenizer), which extracts high-level
semantic information essential for accomplishing understanding tasks using text
LLMs. In this way, USToken enjoys better modality commonality with text, which
reduces the difficulty of modality alignment in adapting text LLMs to speech
LLMs. Secondly, we present DualSpeechLM, a dual-token modeling framework that
concurrently models USToken as input and acoustic token as output within a
unified, end-to-end framework, seamlessly integrating speech understanding and
generation capabilities. Furthermore, we propose a novel semantic supervision
loss and a Chain-of-Condition (CoC) strategy to stabilize model training and
enhance speech generation performance. Experimental results demonstrate that
our proposed approach effectively fosters a complementary relationship between
understanding and generation tasks, highlighting the promising strategy of
mutually enhancing both tasks in one unified model.

Motivation: 预训练的ASR模型在不同录音通道下的性能会显著下降，传统研究将其归因于训练与测试语料的不匹配，而本研究认为通道差异会从根本上损害ASR性能。

Method: 提出了一种归一化技术，通过将ASR模型的内部特征表示与干净参考通道的特征对齐，以减少通道变化的影响。

Result: 该方法显著提高了ASR在未见过的通道和语言上的性能，显示出其跨通道和跨语言的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该归一化技术有效解决了ASR模型在不同录音通道下的性能下降问题，并展示了其广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Pre-trained automatic speech recognition (ASR) models have demonstrated
strong performance on a variety of tasks. However, their performance can
degrade substantially when the input audio comes from different recording
channels. While previous studies have demonstrated this phenomenon, it is often
attributed to the mismatch between training and testing corpora. This study
argues that variations in speech characteristics caused by different recording
channels can fundamentally harm ASR performance. To address this limitation, we
propose a normalization technique designed to mitigate the impact of channel
variation by aligning internal feature representations in the ASR model with
those derived from a clean reference channel. This approach significantly
improves ASR performance on previously unseen channels and languages,
highlighting its ability to generalize across channel and language differences.

Abstract: Neural audio processing has unlocked novel methods of sound transformation

buffer sizes, sample rate conversion, delay compensation, and control parameter
handling within a unified, model-agnostic interface, our framework enables
seamless interoperability between neural models and host plugins while allowing
users to work entirely in Python. We provide a technical overview of the
interfaces needed to accomplish this, as well as the corresponding SDK
implementations. We also demonstrate the SDK's versatility across applications
such as audio effect emulation, timbre transfer, and sample generation, as well
as its adoption by researchers, educators, companies, and artists alike. The

Abstract: Serving LLM adapters has gained significant attention as an effective
approach to adapt general-purpose language models to diverse, task-specific use
cases. However, serving a wide range of adapters introduces several and
substantial overheads, leading to performance degradation and challenges in
optimal placement. To address these challenges, we present an analytical,
AI-driven pipeline that accurately determines the optimal allocation of
adapters in single-node setups. This allocation maximizes performance,
effectively using GPU resources, while preventing request starvation.
Crucially, the proposed allocation is given based on current workload patterns.
These insights in single-node setups can be leveraged in multi-replica
deployments for overall placement, load balancing and server configuration,
ultimately enhancing overall performance and improving resource efficiency. Our
approach builds on an in-depth analysis of LLM adapter serving, accounting for
overheads and performance variability, and includes the development of the
first Digital Twin capable of replicating online LLM-adapter serving systems
with matching key performance metrics. The experimental results demonstrate
that the Digital Twin achieves a SMAPE difference of no more than 5.5% in
throughput compared to real results, and the proposed pipeline accurately
predicts the optimal placement with minimal latency.

Result: 实验验证了平滑效果，PC-LSILS进一步提升了算法性能。

Conclusion: HC变换和LSILS框架有效改善了UBQP和TSP的求解性能，PC-LSILS进一步优化了结果。

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problem (COP) is difficult to solve because of the
massive number of local optimal solutions in his solution space. Various
methods have been put forward to smooth the solution space of COPs, including
homotopic convex (HC) transformation for the traveling salesman problem (TSP).
This paper extends the HC transformation approach to unconstrained binary
quadratic programming (UBQP) by proposing a method to construct a unimodal toy
UBQP of any size. We theoretically prove the unimodality of the constructed toy
UBQP. After that, we apply this unimodal toy UBQP to smooth the original UBQP
by using the HC transformation framework and empirically verify the smoothing
effects. Subsequently, we introduce an iterative algorithmic framework
incorporating HC transformation, referred as landscape smoothing iterated local
search (LSILS). Our experimental analyses, conducted on various UBQP instances
show the effectiveness of LSILS. Furthermore, this paper proposes a parallel
cooperative variant of LSILS, denoted as PC-LSILS and apply it to both the UBQP
and the TSP. Our experimental findings highlight that PC-LSILS improves the
smoothing performance of the HC transformation, and further improves the
overall performance of the algorithm.

Motivation: 探索不同玩具UBQP问题对LSILS算法平滑崎岖地形的影响，以优化UBQP问题的求解效率。

Method: 评估三种玩具UBQP（基于'+/-1'、'+/-i'和随机构造）的地形平坦性，并测试LSILS算法在不同玩具UBQP下的效率。

Result: 基于'+/-1'的玩具UBQP地形最平坦，随机构造的最不平坦；基于'+/-i'的玩具UBQP在LSILS中表现最佳。

Conclusion: 不同构造方式的玩具UBQP对平滑效果有显著影响，基于'+/-i'的构造方式在LSILS中最有效。

Abstract: The hardness of the Unconstrained Binary Quadratic Program (UBQP) problem is
due its rugged landscape. Various algorithms have been proposed for UBQP,
including the Landscape Smoothing Iterated Local Search (LSILS). Different from
other UBQP algorithms, LSILS tries to smooth the rugged landscape by building a
convex combination of the original UBQP and a toy UBQP. In this paper, our
study further investigates the impact of smoothing rugged landscapes using
different toy UBQP problems, including a toy UBQP with matrix ^Q1 (construct by
"+/-1"), a toy UBQP with matrix ^Q2 (construct by "+/-i") and a toy UBQP with
matrix ^Q3 (construct randomly). We first assess the landscape flatness of the
three toy UBQPs. Subsequently, we test the efficiency of LSILS with different
toy UBQPs. Results reveal that the toy UBQP with ^Q1 (construct by "+/-1")
exhibits the flattest landscape among the three, while the toy UBQP with ^Q3
(construct randomly) presents the most non-flat landscape. Notably, LSILS using
the toy UBQP with ^Q2 (construct by "+/-i") emerges as the most effective,
while ^Q3 (construct randomly) has the poorest result. These findings
contribute to a detailed understanding of landscape smoothing techniques in
optimizing UBQP.

Abstract: Addressing irregular cutting and packing (C&P) optimization problems poses
two distinct challenges: the geometric challenge of determining whether or not
an item can be placed feasibly at a certain position, and the optimization
challenge of finding a good solution according to some objective function.
Until now, those tackling such problems have had to address both challenges
simultaneously, requiring two distinct sets of expertise and a lot of research
& development effort. One way to lower this barrier is to decouple the two
challenges. In this paper we introduce a powerful collision detection engine
(CDE) for 2D irregular C&P problems which assumes full responsibility for the
geometric challenge. The CDE (i) allows users to focus with full confidence on
their optimization challenge by abstracting geometry away and (ii) enables
independent advances to propagate to all optimization algorithms built atop it.
We present a set of core principles and design philosophies to model a general
and adaptable CDE focused on maximizing performance, accuracy and robustness.
These principles are accompanied by a concrete open-source implementation
called $\texttt{jagua-rs}$. This paper together with its implementation serves
as a catalyst for future advances in irregular C&P problems by providing a
solid foundation which can either be used as it currently exists or be further
improved upon.

Conclusion: DiffVolume为LOB成交量生成提供了一个强大且灵活的框架。

Abstract: Modeling limit order books (LOBs) dynamics is a fundamental problem in market
microstructure research. In particular, generating high-dimensional volume
snapshots with strong temporal and liquidity-dependent patterns remains a
challenging task, despite recent work exploring the application of Generative
Adversarial Networks to LOBs. In this work, we propose a conditional
\textbf{Diff}usion model for the generation of future LOB \textbf{Volume}
snapshots (\textbf{DiffVolume}). We evaluate our model across three axes: (1)
\textit{Realism}, where we show that DiffVolume, conditioned on past volume
history and time of day, better reproduces statistical properties such as
marginal distribution, spatial correlation, and autocorrelation decay; (2)
\textit{Counterfactual generation}, allowing for controllable generation under
hypothetical liquidity scenarios by additionally conditioning on a target
future liquidity profile; and (3) \textit{Downstream prediction}, where we show
that the synthetic counterfactual data from our model improves the performance
of future liquidity forecasting models. Together, these results suggest that
DiffVolume provides a powerful and flexible framework for realistic and
controllable LOB volume generation.

TL;DR: SRP是一个统一的预测建模框架，通过结合一元依赖和复合依赖，增强关系数据库中表格数据的预测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 关系数据库（RDBs）虽然广泛使用，但其结构限制了深度学习方法的潜力。现有研究主要关注一元依赖，忽略了复合依赖的潜在价值。

Method: SRP通过特征合成、信息检索和图传播机制，捕捉一元和复合依赖，并学习相邻模式进行预测。

Result: 在五个真实数据集上的实验证明了SRP的有效性和工业应用潜力。

Conclusion: SRP通过新的检索机制全面捕捉依赖关系，为关系数据库的预测建模提供了新思路。

Abstract: Relational databases (RDBs) have become the industry standard for storing
massive and heterogeneous data. However, despite the widespread use of RDBs
across various fields, the inherent structure of relational databases hinders
their ability to benefit from flourishing deep learning methods. Previous
research has primarily focused on exploiting the unary dependency among
multiple tables in a relational database using the primary key - foreign key
relationships, either joining multiple tables into a single table or
constructing a graph among them, which leaves the implicit composite relations
among different tables and a substantial potential of improvement for
predictive modeling unexplored. In this paper, we propose SRP, a unified
predictive modeling framework that synthesizes features using the unary
dependency, retrieves related information to capture the composite dependency,
and propagates messages across a constructed graph to learn adjacent patterns
for prediction on relation databases. By introducing a new retrieval mechanism
into RDB, SRP is designed to fully capture both the unary and the composite
dependencies within a relational database, thereby enhancing the receptive
field of tabular data prediction. In addition, we conduct a comprehensive
analysis on the components of SRP, offering a nuanced understanding of model
behaviors and practical guidelines for future applications. Extensive
experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SRP
and its potential applicability in industrial scenarios. The code is released

TL;DR: E3-Rewrite利用大语言模型（LLM）和强化学习框架，提出了一种新的SQL查询重写方法，显著提升了查询效率和覆盖率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于规则的SQL查询重写方法在处理复杂查询和新模式时效果不佳，且难以捕捉多样化的重写策略。

Method: E3-Rewrite结合上下文构造模块和强化学习框架，通过执行计划和演示构建提示，并设计奖励函数优化可执行性、等价性和效率。

Result: 实验表明，E3-Rewrite在多个SQL基准测试中，查询执行时间减少25.6%，成功重写率提高24.4%。

Conclusion: E3-Rewrite通过LLM和强化学习，显著提升了SQL查询重写的性能和适用范围。

Abstract: SQL query rewriting aims to reformulate a query into a more efficient form
while preserving equivalence. Most existing methods rely on predefined rewrite
rules. However, such rule-based approaches face fundamental limitations: (1)
fixed rule sets generalize poorly to novel query patterns and struggle with
complex queries; (2) a wide range of effective rewriting strategies cannot be
fully captured by declarative rules. To overcome these issues, we propose using
large language models (LLMs) to generate rewrites. LLMs can capture complex
strategies, such as evaluation reordering and CTE rewriting. Despite this
potential, directly applying LLMs often results in suboptimal or non-equivalent
rewrites due to a lack of execution awareness and semantic grounding. To
address these challenges, We present E3-Rewrite, an LLM-based SQL rewriting
framework that produces executable, equivalent, and efficient queries. It
integrates two core components: a context construction module and a
reinforcement learning framework. First, the context module leverages execution
plans and retrieved demonstrations to build bottleneck-aware prompts that guide
inference-time rewriting. Second, we design a reward function targeting
executability, equivalence, and efficiency, evaluated via syntax checks,
equivalence verification, and cost estimation. Third, to ensure stable
multi-objective learning, we adopt a staged curriculum that first emphasizes
executability and equivalence, then gradually incorporates efficiency.
Extensive experiments show that E3-Rewrite achieves up to a 25.6\% reduction in
query execution time compared to state-of-the-art methods across multiple SQL
benchmarks. Moreover, it delivers up to 24.4\% more successful rewrites,
expanding coverage to complex queries that previous systems failed to handle.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: SCOPE是一种通过稀疏余弦变换降低输入空间维度的进化学习方法，在Atari游戏Space Invaders中表现优于其他进化方法和简单强化学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 游戏领域的大状态空间对进化方法提出了挑战，因为输入状态扩展会导致策略参数增加，进而指数级扩大搜索空间，降低收敛速度。

Method: SCOPE利用离散余弦变换（DCT）作为伪注意力机制，将输入状态转换为系数矩阵，并通过截断和稀疏化降低维度，同时保留原始输入的高能量特征。

Result: 在Space Invaders任务中，SCOPE结合CMA-ES算法，输入空间减少53%，性能优于OpenAI-ES、HyperNEAT、DQN和A3C。

Conclusion: SCOPE通过降低输入空间维度和稀疏化处理，有效提升了进化方法在游戏领域的性能。

Abstract: Evolutionary approaches have previously been shown to be effective learning
methods for a diverse set of domains. However, the domain of game-playing poses
a particular challenge for evolutionary methods due to the inherently large
state space of video games. As the size of the input state expands, the size of
the policy must also increase in order to effectively learn the temporal
patterns in the game space. Consequently, a larger policy must contain more
trainable parameters, exponentially increasing the size of the search space.
Any increase in search space is highly problematic for evolutionary methods, as
increasing the number of trainable parameters is inversely correlated with
convergence speed. To reduce the size of the input space while maintaining a
meaningful representation of the original space, we introduce Sparse Cosine
Optimized Policy Evolution (SCOPE). SCOPE utilizes the Discrete Cosine
Transform (DCT) as a pseudo attention mechanism, transforming an input state
into a coefficient matrix. By truncating and applying sparsification to this
matrix, we reduce the dimensionality of the input space while retaining the
highest energy features of the original input. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of SCOPE as the policy for the Atari game Space Invaders. In this task, SCOPE
with CMA-ES outperforms evolutionary methods that consider an unmodified input
state, such as OpenAI-ES and HyperNEAT. SCOPE also outperforms simple
reinforcement learning methods, such as DQN and A3C. SCOPE achieves this result
through reducing the input size by 53% from 33,600 to 15,625 then using a
bilinear affine mapping of sparse DCT coefficients to policy actions learned by
the CMA-ES algorithm.

TL;DR: OISMA是一种新型内存计算架构，利用准随机计算域的简单性，显著提升矩阵乘法的性能和能效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI模型的计算瓶颈在于大规模矩阵乘法，现有内存计算架构存在性能与能效限制。

Method: OISMA通过将内存读取操作转换为原位随机乘法操作，并利用累加外围电路实现矩阵乘法功能。

Result: 在4x4到512x512矩阵上，OISMA的平均相对Frobenius误差显著降低，能效和面积效率优于现有架构。

Conclusion: OISMA在性能和能效上具有显著优势，且随着技术节点的缩小，其优势将进一步放大。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence models are currently driven by a significant
up-scaling of their complexity, with massive matrix multiplication workloads
representing the major computational bottleneck. In-memory computing
architectures are proposed to avoid the Von Neumann bottleneck. However, both
digital/binary-based and analogue in-memory computing architectures suffer from
various limitations, which significantly degrade the performance and energy
efficiency gains. This work proposes OISMA, a novel in-memory computing
architecture that utilizes the computational simplicity of a quasi-stochastic
computing domain (Bent-Pyramid system), while keeping the same efficiency,
scalability, and productivity of digital memories. OISMA converts normal memory
read operations into in-situ stochastic multiplication operations with a
negligible cost. An accumulation periphery then accumulates the output
multiplication bitstreams, achieving the matrix multiplication functionality.
Extensive matrix multiplication benchmarking was conducted to analyze the
accuracy of the Bent-Pyramid system, using matrix dimensions ranging from 4x4
to 512x512. The accuracy results show a significant decrease in the average
relative Frobenius error, from 9.42% (for 4x4) to 1.81% (for 512x512), compared
to 64-bit double precision floating-point format. A 1T1R OISMA array of 4 KB
capacity was implemented using a commercial 180nm technology node and in-house
RRAM technology. At 50 MHz, OISMA achieves 0.891 TOPS/W and 3.98 GOPS/mm2 for
energy and area efficiency, respectively, occupying an effective computing area
of 0.804241 mm2. Scaling OISMA from 180nm to 22nm technology shows a
significant improvement of two orders of magnitude in energy efficiency and one
order of magnitude in area efficiency, compared to dense matrix multiplication
in-memory computing architectures.

TL;DR: PGDI是一种基于扩散的语音修复框架，能够准确重建长达一秒的缺失或损坏语音段，同时保留说话者身份、韵律和环境因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在说话者变异性或长间隙修复上的不足，适用于现实场景中的强瞬态噪声。

Method: 采用分类器引导（特别是音素级引导）提升重建保真度，支持说话者无关操作。

Result: 实验表明PGDI在多样说话者和间隙长度下表现优异，能处理挑战性声学条件。

Conclusion: PGDI在有无文本辅助下均有效，适用于现实应用。

Abstract: In this paper, we present PGDI, a diffusion-based speech inpainting framework
for restoring missing or severely corrupted speech segments. Unlike previous
methods that struggle with speaker variability or long gap lengths, PGDI can
accurately reconstruct gaps of up to one second in length while preserving
speaker identity, prosody, and environmental factors such as reverberation.
Central to this approach is classifier guidance, specifically phoneme-level
guidance, which substantially improves reconstruction fidelity. PGDI operates
in a speaker-independent manner and maintains robustness even when long
segments are completely masked by strong transient noise, making it well-suited
for real-world applications, such as fireworks, door slams, hammer strikes, and
construction noise. Through extensive experiments across diverse speakers and
gap lengths, we demonstrate PGDI's superior inpainting performance and its
ability to handle challenging acoustic conditions. We consider both scenarios,
with and without access to the transcript during inference, showing that while
the availability of text further enhances performance, the model remains
effective even in its absence. For audio samples, visit:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型在情感识别任务中性能强，但存在计算成本高和依赖说话者信息的问题，限制了其泛化能力。

Method: 提出LPGNet，采用轻量级并行交互注意力模块（LPIA）和双门控融合方法，去除说话者嵌入。

Result: 在IEMOCAP数据集上，LPGNet在4类情感分类中达到87%以上的准确率和F1分数，优于基线模型。

Conclusion: LPGNet在减少参数和提高泛化能力方面表现出色，适用于实际对话场景。

Abstract: Emotion recognition in conversations (ERC) aims to predict the emotional
state of each utterance by using multiple input types, such as text and audio.
While Transformer-based models have shown strong performance in this task, they
often face two major issues: high computational cost and heavy dependence on
speaker information. These problems reduce their ability to generalize in
real-world conversations. To solve these challenges, we propose LPGNet, a
Lightweight network with Parallel attention and Gated fusion for multimodal
ERC. The main part of LPGNet is the Lightweight Parallel Interaction Attention
(LPIA) module. This module replaces traditional stacked Transformer layers with
parallel dot-product attention, which can model both within-modality and
between-modality relationships more efficiently. To improve emotional feature
learning, LPGNet also uses a dual-gated fusion method. This method filters and
combines features from different input types in a flexible and dynamic way. In
addition, LPGNet removes speaker embeddings completely, which allows the model
to work independently of speaker identity. Experiments on the IEMOCAP dataset
show that LPGNet reaches over 87% accuracy and F1-score in 4-class emotion
classification. It outperforms strong baseline models while using fewer
parameters and showing better generalization across speakers.

Result: 上下文感知条件显著提升了修复性能和稳定性，减少了失真条件下的变异性。

Conclusion: 上下文相关条件策略在语音修复中表现优越，优于传统基于内容的方法。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to speech restoration by integrating a
context-related conditioning strategy. Specifically, we employ the
diffusion-based generative restoration model, UNIVERSE++, as a backbone to
evaluate the effectiveness of contextual representations. We incorporate
acoustic context embeddings extracted from the CLAP model, which capture the
environmental attributes of input audio. Additionally, we propose an Acoustic
Context (ACX) representation that refines CLAP embeddings to better handle
various distortion factors and their intensity in speech signals. Unlike
content-based approaches that rely on linguistic and speaker attributes, ACX
provides contextual information that enables the restoration model to
distinguish and mitigate distortions better. Experimental results indicate that
context-aware conditioning improves both restoration performance and its
stability across diverse distortion conditions, reducing variability compared
to content-based methods.

Motivation: 解决传统Encodec模型直接从特征提取F0的问题，提出基于重建EGG信号的更准确F0提取方法。

Method: 采用多尺度频域损失函数和时间域相关损失，去除GAN判别器以简化训练。

Result: 在广泛使用的EGG数据集上，MAE从14.14 Hz降至13.69 Hz，VDE提升38.2%。

Conclusion: EGGCodec通过优化损失函数和简化训练流程，显著提升了F0提取的准确性和效率。

Abstract: This letter introduces EGGCodec, a robust neural Encodec framework engineered
for electroglottography (EGG) signal reconstruction and F0 extraction. We
propose a multi-scale frequency-domain loss function to capture the nuanced
relationship between original and reconstructed EGG signals, complemented by a
time-domain correlation loss to improve generalization and accuracy. Unlike
conventional Encodec models that extract F0 directly from features, EGGCodec
leverages reconstructed EGG signals, which more closely correspond to F0. By
removing the conventional GAN discriminator, we streamline EGGCodec's training
process without compromising efficiency, incurring only negligible performance
degradation. Trained on a widely used EGG-inclusive dataset, extensive
evaluations demonstrate that EGGCodec outperforms state-of-the-art F0
extraction schemes, reducing mean absolute error (MAE) from 14.14 Hz to 13.69
Hz, and improving voicing decision error (VDE) by 38.2\%. Moreover, extensive
ablation experiments validate the contribution of each component of EGGCodec.

Method: 结合PSLQ整数关系算法与高斯整数的数论过滤器，进行大规模搜索，并通过算法扩展生成更长的公式。

Result: 发现了新的5项和6项关系，Lehmer测度创纪录低（λ=1.4572, λ=1.3291）。

Conclusion: 约束PSLQ搜索与算法扩展相结合的方法为未来探索提供了稳健的框架。

Abstract: Machin-like arctangent relations are classical tools for computing $\pi$,
with efficiency quantified by the Lehmer measure ($\lambda$). We present a
framework for discovering low-measure relations by coupling the PSLQ
integer-relation algorithm with number-theoretic filters derived from the
algebraic structure of Gaussian integers, making large scale search tractable.
Our search yields new 5 and 6 term relations with record-low Lehmer measures
($\lambda=1.4572, \lambda=1.3291$). We also demonstrate how discovered
relations can serve as a basis for generating new, longer formulae through
algorithmic extensions. This combined approach of a constrained PSLQ search and

TL;DR: SafeKV是一种隐私感知的KV缓存管理框架，通过选择性共享非敏感条目和隔离敏感内容，显著减少时间侧信道攻击，同时提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全局KV缓存共享虽加速LLM推理，但引入时间侧信道攻击风险，现有防御方法（如每用户隔离）性能下降显著。

Method: SafeKV包括混合多级检测管道、统一基数树索引和基于熵的访问监控，实现敏感内容隔离与非敏感内容共享。

Result: SafeKV减少94%-97%的时间侧信道攻击，TTFT提升40.58%，吞吐量提升2.66倍，显著降低缓存开销。

Conclusion: SafeKV在保持高性能的同时，为LLM推理提供强隐私保障，平衡了共享效率与隐私安全。

Abstract: Global KV-cache sharing has emerged as a key optimization for accelerating
large language model (LLM) inference. However, it exposes a new class of timing
side-channel attacks, enabling adversaries to infer sensitive user inputs via
shared cache entries. Existing defenses, such as per-user isolation, eliminate
leakage but degrade performance by up to 38.9% in time-to-first-token (TTFT),
making them impractical for high-throughput deployment. To address this gap, we
introduce SafeKV (Secure and Flexible KV Cache Sharing), a privacy-aware
KV-cache management framework that selectively shares non-sensitive entries
while confining sensitive content to private caches. SafeKV comprises three
components: (i) a hybrid, multi-tier detection pipeline that integrates
rule-based pattern matching, a general-purpose privacy detector, and
context-aware validation; (ii) a unified radix-tree index that manages public
and private entries across heterogeneous memory tiers (HBM, DRAM, SSD); and
(iii) entropy-based access monitoring to detect and mitigate residual
information leakage. Our evaluation shows that SafeKV mitigates 94% - 97% of
timing-based side-channel attacks. Compared to per-user isolation method,
SafeKV improves TTFT by up to 40.58% and throughput by up to 2.66X across
diverse LLMs and workloads. SafeKV reduces cache-induced TTFT overhead from
50.41% to 11.74% on Qwen3-235B. By combining fine-grained privacy control with
high cache reuse efficiency, SafeKV reclaims the performance advantages of
global sharing while providing robust runtime privacy guarantees for LLM
inference.

Abstract: As digital data transmission continues to scale, concerns about privacy grow
increasingly urgent - yet privacy remains a socially constructed and
ambiguously defined concept, lacking a universally accepted quantitative
measure. This work examines information leakage in image data, a domain where
information-theoretic guarantees are still underexplored. At the intersection
of deep learning, information theory, and cryptography, we investigate the use
of mutual information (MI) estimators - in particular, the empirical estimator
and the MINE framework - to detect leakage from selectively encrypted images.
Motivated by the intuition that a robust estimator would require a
probabilistic frameworks that can capture spatial dependencies and residual
structures, even within encrypted representations - our work represent a
promising direction for image information leakage estimation.

Abstract: As the social implementation of AI has been steadily progressing, research
and development related to AI security has also been increasing. However,
existing studies have been limited to organizing related techniques, attacks,
defenses, and risks in terms of specific domains or AI elements. Thus, it
extremely difficult to understand the relationships among them and how negative
impacts on stakeholders are brought about. In this paper, we argue that the
knowledge, technologies, and social impacts related to AI security should be
holistically organized to help understand relationships among them. To this
end, we first develop an AI security map that holistically organizes
interrelationships among elements related to AI security as well as negative
impacts on information systems and stakeholders. This map consists of the two
aspects, namely the information system aspect (ISA) and the external influence
aspect (EIA). The elements that AI should fulfill within information systems
are classified under the ISA. The EIA includes elements that affect
stakeholders as a result of AI being attacked or misused. For each element,
corresponding negative impacts are identified. By referring to the AI security
map, one can understand the potential negative impacts, along with their causes
and countermeasures. Additionally, our map helps clarify how the negative
impacts on AI-based systems relate to those on stakeholders. We show some
findings newly obtained by referring to our map. We also provide several
recommendations and open problems to guide future AI security communities.

Abstract: In digital substations, security events pose significant challenges to the
sustained operation of power systems. To mitigate these challenges, the
implementation of robust defense strategies is critically important. A thorough
process of anomaly identification and detection in information and
communication technology (ICT) frameworks is crucial to ensure secure and
reliable communication and coordination between interconnected devices within
digital substations. Hence, this paper addresses the critical cybersecurity
challenges confronting IEC61850-based digital substations within modern smart
grids, where the integration of advanced communication protocols, e.g., generic
object-oriented substation event (GOOSE), has enhanced energy management and
introduced significant vulnerabilities to cyberattacks. Focusing on the
limitations of traditional anomaly detection systems (ADSs) in detecting
threats, this research proposes a transformative approach by leveraging
generative AI (GenAI) to develop robust ADSs. The primary contributions include
the suggested advanced adversarial traffic mutation (AATM) technique to
generate synthesized and balanced datasets for GOOSE messages, ensuring
protocol compliance and enabling realistic zero-day attack pattern creation to
address data scarcity. Then, the implementation of GenAI-based ADSs
incorporating the task-oriented dialogue (ToD) processes has been explored for
improved detection of attack patterns. Finally, a comparison of the GenAI-based
ADS with machine learning (ML)-based ADSs has been implemented to showcase the
outperformance of the GenAI-based frameworks considering the AATM-generated
GOOSE datasets and standard/advanced performance evaluation metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在敏感环境中部署时，指纹攻击带来隐私和安全风险，需研究攻防策略。

Method: 攻击方法使用强化学习优化查询选择；防御方法通过次级LLM进行语义保留输出过滤。

Result: 攻击方法仅需3次查询即可提高指纹识别准确率；防御方法降低指纹识别率且保持输出质量。

Conclusion: 研究提升了指纹工具能力，并提供了实用的防御策略。

Abstract: As large language models are increasingly deployed in sensitive environments,
fingerprinting attacks pose significant privacy and security risks. We present
a study of LLM fingerprinting from both offensive and defensive perspectives.
Our attack methodology uses reinforcement learning to automatically optimize
query selection, achieving better fingerprinting accuracy with only 3 queries
compared to randomly selecting 3 queries from the same pool. Our defensive
approach employs semantic-preserving output filtering through a secondary LLM
to obfuscate model identity while maintaining semantic integrity. The defensive
method reduces fingerprinting accuracy across tested models while preserving
output quality. These contributions show the potential to improve
fingerprinting tools capabilities while providing practical mitigation
strategies against fingerprinting attacks.

Abstract: Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are a vital part of a network-connected
device. In this paper, we develop a deep learning based intrusion detection
system that is deployed in a distributed setup across devices connected to a
network. Our aim is to better equip deep learning models against unknown
attacks using knowledge from known attacks. To this end, we develop algorithms
to maximize the number of transferability relationships. We propose a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, along with two algorithms that
maximize the number of relationships observed. One is a two step data
pre-processing stage, and the other is a Block-Based Smart Aggregation (BBSA)
algorithm. The proposed system succeeds in achieving superior transferability
performance while maintaining impressive local detection rates. We also show
that our method is generalizable, exhibiting transferability potential across
datasets and even with different backbones. The code for this work can be found

TL;DR: EditMF是一种无需训练的指纹嵌入范式，通过加密知识库中的语义连贯三元组实现高效且隐蔽的LLM所有权验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 保护大型语言模型（LLM）的知识产权（IP）是资源密集型任务，现有方法在隐蔽性和效率上存在不足。

Method: 利用加密知识库中的三元组（如虚拟作者-小说-主角），通过因果追踪和零空间更新嵌入指纹，仅需单次黑盒查询验证。

Result: 在LLaMA和Qwen模型上，EditMF实现了高隐蔽性、低性能损失，且鲁棒性远超LoRA指纹方法。

Conclusion: EditMF是一种高效、低开销的LLM所有权验证解决方案。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) is resource-intensive and expensive,
making protecting intellectual property (IP) for LLMs crucial. Recently,
embedding fingerprints into LLMs has emerged as a prevalent method for
establishing model ownership. However, existing back-door-based methods suffer
from limited stealth and efficiency. To simultaneously address these issues, we
propose EditMF, a training-free fingerprinting paradigm that achieves highly
imperceptible fingerprint embedding with minimal computational overhead.
Ownership bits are mapped to compact, semantically coherent triples drawn from
an encrypted artificial knowledge base (e.g., virtual author-novel-protagonist
facts). Causal tracing localizes the minimal set of layers influencing each
triple, and a zero-space update injects the fingerprint without perturbing
unrelated knowledge. Verification requires only a single black-box query and
succeeds when the model returns the exact pre-embedded protagonist. Empirical
results on LLaMA and Qwen families show that EditMF combines high
imperceptibility with negligible model's performance loss, while delivering
robustness far beyond LoRA-based fingerprinting and approaching that of SFT
embeddings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EditMF is an effective and
low-overhead solution for secure LLM ownership verification.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种利用LLMs建模大规模跨国态度演变的框架，首次模拟了美国公民对中国的长期态度变化，并揭示了媒体偏见对观点形成的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是利用LLMs的先进推理能力，模拟复杂的大规模人类认知趋势，尤其是跨国态度演变，填补了现有研究在长期、跨国视角上的空白。

Method: 方法包括整合媒体数据收集、用户档案创建和认知架构，利用LLMs实现去偏见的媒体曝光，并引入“魔鬼代言人”代理解释态度反转。

Result: 模拟结果成功再现了2005年至今美国对华态度的真实趋势，揭示了媒体偏见和选择偏差对态度形成的影响。

Conclusion: 该研究为基于LLM的大规模、长期、跨国社会认知行为建模提供了新范式，有助于减少偏见和促进跨文化理解。

Abstract: The rise of LLMs poses new possibilities in modeling opinion evolution, a
long-standing task in simulation, by leveraging advanced reasoning abilities to
recreate complex, large-scale human cognitive trends. While most prior works
focus on opinion evolution surrounding specific isolated events or the views
within a country, ours is the first to model the large-scale attitude evolution
of a population representing an entire country towards another -- US citizens'
perspectives towards China. To tackle the challenges of this broad scenario, we
propose a framework that integrates media data collection, user profile
creation, and cognitive architecture for opinion updates to successfully
reproduce the real trend of US attitudes towards China over a 20-year period
from 2005 to today. We also leverage LLMs' capabilities to introduce debiased
media exposure, extracting neutral events from typically subjective news
contents, to uncover the roots of polarized opinion formation, as well as a
devils advocate agent to help explain the rare reversal from negative to
positive attitudes towards China, corresponding with changes in the way
Americans obtain information about the country. The simulation results, beyond
validating our framework architecture, also reveal the impact of biased framing
and selection bias in shaping attitudes. Overall, our work contributes to a new
paradigm for LLM-based modeling of cognitive behaviors in a large-scale,
long-term, cross-border social context, providing insights into the formation
of international biases and offering valuable implications for media consumers
to better understand the factors shaping their perspectives, and ultimately
contributing to the larger social need for bias reduction and cross-cultural
tolerance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI算法在电商平台定价和广告决策中是否引发隐性共谋，以及对消费者、卖家和平台的影响。

Method: 采用多智能体强化学习分析竞争，并基于亚马逊大规模数据集进行校准。

Result: 高搜索成本下算法协调降低广告竞价和价格，带来三方共赢；平台调整佣金而非保留价可增加利润。

Conclusion: 研究缓解了对竞争性学习算法潜在负面影响的担忧，为相关方决策提供依据。

Abstract: Online sellers have been adopting AI learning algorithms to automatically
make product pricing and advertising decisions on e-commerce platforms. When
sellers compete using such algorithms, one concern is that of tacit collusion -
the algorithms learn to coordinate on higher than competitive. We empirically
investigate whether these concerns are valid when sellers make pricing and
advertising decisions together, i.e., two-dimensional decisions. Our empirical
strategy is to analyze competition with multi-agent reinforcement learning,
which we calibrate to a large-scale dataset collected from Amazon.com products.
Our first contribution is to find conditions under which learning algorithms
can facilitate win-win-win outcomes that are beneficial for consumers, sellers,
and even the platform, when consumers have high search costs. In these cases
the algorithms learn to coordinate on prices that are lower than competitive
prices. The intuition is that the algorithms learn to coordinate on lower
advertising bids, which lower advertising costs, leading to lower prices. Our
second contribution is an analysis of a large-scale, high-frequency
keyword-product dataset for more than 2 million products on Amazon.com. Our
estimates of consumer search costs show a wide range of costs for different
product keywords. We generate an algorithm usage and find a negative
interaction between the estimated consumer search costs and the algorithm usage
index, providing empirical evidence of beneficial collusion. Finally, we
analyze the platform's strategic response. We find that reserve price
adjustments will not increase profits for the platform, but commission
adjustments will. Our analyses help alleviate some worries about the
potentially harmful effects of competing learning algorithms, and can help
sellers, platforms and policymakers to decide on whether to adopt or regulate
such algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确识别miR-mRNA靶标互作对理解miRNA功能及治疗潜力至关重要，但现有数据分散且复杂。

Method: 开发miRKatDB（整合预测和验证的miR-target互作数据库）和miRKatAI（基于LLM的智能查询系统）。

Result: 提供全面的miR-target互作数据及自然语言查询功能，支持数据可视化和假设生成。

Conclusion: miRKat Suite通过整合数据和智能工具，提升miRNA研究的效率和深度。

Abstract: MicroRNAs (miRs) are robust regulators of gene expression, implicated in most
biological processes. microRNAs predominantly downregulate the expression of
genes post-transcriptionally and each miR is predicted to target several
hundred genes. The accurate identification and annotation of miR-mRNA target
interactions is central to understanding miRs function and their therapeutic
potential. However, computational target prediction is challenging due to
imperfect complementarity of miRs with their targets and the growing volume and
heterogeneity of experimental data present challenges in accessing,
integrating, and analysing miR-target interaction information across biological
contexts. This creates a need for integrated resources and intelligent query
tools.
  We present the miRKat Suite, comprising miRKatDB, a comprehensive, curated
database of predicted and validated miR-target interactions and associated
annotations, and miRKatAI, a multi-agent system powered by large language
models (LLMs) and LangGraph. miRKatDB integrates data from multiple publicly
available sources, providing a comprehensive foundation for miR studies,
including miR target genes and changes in levels of tissue expression
previously reported. miRKatAI offers a natural language interface for complex
querying of miRKatDB, facilitates grounded information retrieval from
established sources in the field, and supports basic data visualisation. The
miRKat Suite aims to accelerate miR research by streamlining data access,
enhancing exploratory analysis, and supporting hypothesis generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解基因扰动在不同细胞环境中的效应是功能基因组学的核心挑战，对治疗发现和精准医学有重要意义。

Method: CFM-GP利用流匹配目标学习未扰动和扰动基因表达分布之间的连续时间依赖转换，适用于所有细胞类型。

Result: 在五个数据集上，CFM-GP在R平方和Spearman相关性上优于基线方法，并能恢复关键生物通路。

Conclusion: CFM-GP是一种稳健且具有生物保真度的跨细胞类型基因扰动预测方法。

Abstract: Understanding gene perturbation effects across diverse cellular contexts is a
central challenge in functional genomics, with important implications for
therapeutic discovery and precision medicine. Single-cell technologies enable
high-resolution measurement of transcriptional responses, but collecting such
data is costly and time-consuming, especially when repeated for each cell type.
Existing computational methods often require separate models per cell type,
limiting scalability and generalization. We present CFM-GP, a method for cell
type-agnostic gene perturbation prediction. CFM-GP learns a continuous,
time-dependent transformation between unperturbed and perturbed gene expression
distributions, conditioned on cell type, allowing a single model to predict
across all cell types. Unlike prior approaches that use discrete modeling,
CFM-GP employs a flow matching objective to capture perturbation dynamics in a
scalable manner. We evaluate on five datasets: SARS-CoV-2 infection, IFN-beta
stimulated PBMCs, glioblastoma treated with Panobinostat, lupus under IFN-beta
stimulation, and Statefate progenitor fate mapping. CFM-GP consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in R-squared and Spearman correlation,
and pathway enrichment analysis confirms recovery of key biological pathways.
These results demonstrate the robustness and biological fidelity of CFM-GP as a
scalable solution for cross-cell type gene perturbation prediction.

*Yingxue Pang,Shijie Zhao,Haiqiang Wang,Gen Zhan,Junlin Li,Li Zhang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于频率辅助的锐化级别预测模型（FreqSP），用于在视频质量提升与带宽成本控制之间找到最佳平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 锐化技术虽能提升视频质量，但过度锐化会导致比特率增加和服务质量下降，因此需要找到最优锐化级别。

Method: 通过标注视频的最优锐化级别作为真实值，利用CNN特征和高频分量预测最优锐化级别。

Result: 实验证明FreqSP能有效预测最优锐化级别，平衡视频质量和带宽成本。

Conclusion: FreqSP为解决视频锐化中的比特率与质量问题提供了一种有效方法。

Abstract: Sharpening is a widely adopted technique to improve video quality, which can
effectively emphasize textures and alleviate blurring. However, increasing the
sharpening level comes with a higher video bitrate, resulting in degraded
Quality of Service (QoS). Furthermore, the video quality does not necessarily
improve with increasing sharpening levels, leading to issues such as
over-sharpening. Clearly, it is essential to figure out how to boost video
quality with a proper sharpening level while also controlling bandwidth costs
effectively. This paper thus proposes a novel Frequency-assisted Sharpening
level Prediction model (FreqSP). We first label each video with the sharpening
level correlating to the optimal bitrate and quality tradeoff as ground truth.
Then taking uncompressed source videos as inputs, the proposed FreqSP leverages
intricate CNN features and high-frequency components to estimate the optimal
sharpening level. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method.

TL;DR: SharpXR是一种结构感知的双解码器U-Net，用于在低剂量儿科X射线中降噪并保留诊断相关特征，显著提升肺炎分类准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在资源匮乏地区，低剂量儿科X射线成像因噪声问题影响诊断准确性，传统降噪方法会损失细节。

Method: SharpXR结合拉普拉斯引导的边缘保留解码器和可学习融合模块，模拟Poisson-Gaussian噪声进行训练。

Result: SharpXR在所有评估指标上优于现有方法，肺炎分类准确率从88.8%提升至92.5%。

Conclusion: SharpXR在低资源儿科护理中具有显著诊断价值，同时保持计算效率。

Abstract: Pediatric chest X-ray imaging is essential for early diagnosis, particularly
in low-resource settings where advanced imaging modalities are often
inaccessible. Low-dose protocols reduce radiation exposure in children but
introduce substantial noise that can obscure critical anatomical details.
Conventional denoising methods often degrade fine details, compromising
diagnostic accuracy. In this paper, we present SharpXR, a structure-aware
dual-decoder U-Net designed to denoise low-dose pediatric X-rays while
preserving diagnostically relevant features. SharpXR combines a
Laplacian-guided edge-preserving decoder with a learnable fusion module that
adaptively balances noise suppression and structural detail retention. To
address the scarcity of paired training data, we simulate realistic
Poisson-Gaussian noise on the Pediatric Pneumonia Chest X-ray dataset. SharpXR
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across all evaluation metrics while
maintaining computational efficiency suitable for resource-constrained
settings. SharpXR-denoised images improved downstream pneumonia classification
accuracy from 88.8% to 92.5%, underscoring its diagnostic value in low-resource
pediatric care.

Result: 方法在稀疏噪声数据下快速（秒级）生成高质量重建体积。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了传统重建方法的局限性，为生物医学成像提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: We present a novel approach to variational volume reconstruction from sparse,
noisy slice data using the Deep Ritz method. Motivated by biomedical imaging
applications such as MRI-based slice-to-volume reconstruction (SVR), our
approach addresses three key challenges: (i) the reliance on image segmentation
to extract boundaries from noisy grayscale slice images, (ii) the need to
reconstruct volumes from a limited number of slice planes, and (iii) the
computational expense of traditional mesh-based methods. We formulate a
variational objective that combines a regression loss designed to avoid image
segmentation by operating on noisy slice data directly with a modified
Cahn-Hilliard energy incorporating anisotropic diffusion to regularize the
reconstructed geometry. We discretize the phase field with a neural network,
approximate the objective at each optimization step with Monte Carlo
integration, and use ADAM to find the minimum of the approximated variational
objective. While the stochastic integration may not yield the true solution to
the variational problem, we demonstrate that our method reliably produces
high-quality reconstructed volumes in a matter of seconds, even when the slice
data is sparse and noisy.

Abstract: Spectral variability significantly impacts the accuracy and convergence of
hyperspectral unmixing algorithms. While many methods address complex spectral
variability, large-scale variations in spectral signature scale caused by
factors such as topography, illumination, and shadowing remain a major
challenge. These variations often degrade unmixing performance and complicate
model fitting. In this paper, we propose a novel preprocessing algorithm that
corrects scale-induced spectral variability prior to unmixing. By isolating and
compensating for these large-scale multiplicative effects, the algorithm
provides a cleaner input, enabling unmixing methods to focus more effectively
on modeling nonlinear spectral variability and abundance estimation. We present
a rigorous mathematical framework to describe scale variability and extensive
experimental validation of the proposed algorithm. Furthermore, the algorithm's
impact is evaluated across a broad spectrum of state-of-the-art unmixing
algorithms on two synthetic and two real hyperspectral datasets. The proposed
preprocessing step consistently improves the performance of these algorithms,
including those specifically designed to handle spectral variability, with
error reductions close to 50% in many cases. This demonstrates that scale
correction acts as a complementary step, facilitating more accurate unmixing by
existing methods. The algorithm's generality and significant impact highlight
its potential as a key component in practical hyperspectral unmixing pipelines.
The implementation code will be made publicly available upon publication.

Abstract: Many methods exist for frame synthesis in image sequences but can be broadly
categorised into frame interpolation and view synthesis techniques.
Fundamentally, both frame interpolation and view synthesis tackle the same
task, interpolating a frame given surrounding frames in time or space. However,
most frame interpolation datasets focus on temporal aspects with single cameras
moving through time and space, while view synthesis datasets are typically
biased toward stereoscopic depth estimation use cases. This makes direct
comparison between view synthesis and frame interpolation methods challenging.
In this paper, we develop a novel multi-camera dataset using a custom-built
dense linear camera array to enable fair comparison between these approaches.
We evaluate classical and deep learning frame interpolators against a view
synthesis method (3D Gaussian Splatting) for the task of view in-betweening.
Our results reveal that deep learning methods do not significantly outperform
classical methods on real image data, with 3D Gaussian Splatting actually
underperforming frame interpolators by as much as 3.5 dB PSNR. However, in
synthetic scenes, the situation reverses -- 3D Gaussian Splatting outperforms
frame interpolation algorithms by almost 5 dB PSNR at a 95% confidence level.

Conclusion: 提出的运动场散度指标在感知质量评估中表现良好，且计算高效，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Video frame interpolation (VFI) offers a way to generate intermediate frames
between consecutive frames of a video sequence. Although the development of
advanced frame interpolation algorithms has received increased attention in
recent years, assessing the perceptual quality of interpolated content remains
an ongoing area of research. In this paper, we investigate simple ways to
process motion fields, with the purposes of using them as video quality metric
for evaluating frame interpolation algorithms. We evaluate these quality
metrics using the BVI-VFI dataset which contains perceptual scores measured for
interpolated sequences. From our investigation we propose a motion metric based
on measuring the divergence of motion fields. This metric correlates reasonably
with these perceptual scores (PLCC=0.51) and is more computationally efficient
(x2.7 speedup) compared to FloLPIPS (a well known motion-based metric). We then
use our new proposed metrics to evaluate a range of state of the art frame
interpolation metrics and find our metrics tend to favour more perceptual
pleasing interpolated frames that may not score highly in terms of PSNR or
SSIM.

Abstract: We study a temporal voting model where voters have dynamic preferences over a
set of public chores -- projects that benefit society, but impose individual
costs on those affected by their implementation. We investigate the
computational complexity of optimizing utilitarian and egalitarian welfare. Our
results show that while optimizing the former is computationally
straightforward, minimizing the latter is computationally intractable, even in
very restricted cases. Nevertheless, we identify several settings where this
problem can be solved efficiently, either exactly or by an approximation
algorithm. We also examine the effects of enforcing temporal fairness and its
impact on social welfare, and analyze the competitive ratio of online
algorithms. We then explore the strategic behavior of agents, providing
insights into potential malfeasance in such decision-making environments.
Finally, we discuss a range of fairness measures and their suitability for our
setting.

Abstract: Robot-assisted neurological surgery is receiving growing interest due to the
improved dexterity, precision, and control of surgical tools, which results in
better patient outcomes. However, such systems often limit surgeons' natural
sensory feedback, which is crucial in identifying tissues -- particularly in
oncological procedures where distinguishing between healthy and tumorous tissue
is vital. While imaging and force sensing have addressed the lack of sensory
feedback, limited research has explored multimodal sensing options for accurate
tissue boundary delineation. We present a user-friendly, modular test bench
designed to evaluate and integrate complementary multimodal sensors for tissue
identification. Our proposed system first uses vision-based guidance to
estimate boundary locations with visual cues, which are then refined using data
acquired by contact microphones and a force sensor. Real-time data acquisition
and visualization are supported via an interactive graphical interface.
Experimental results demonstrate that multimodal fusion significantly improves
material classification accuracy. The platform provides a scalable
hardware-software solution for exploring sensor fusion in surgical applications
and demonstrates the potential of multimodal approaches in real-time tissue
boundary delineation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Chartwin的方法，将定位导向的信道图与动态数字网络孪生（DNT）结合，展示了半监督信道图在构建空间一致性地图中的显著性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无线通信系统需要空间一致的信道表示以高效执行通信任务，信道图技术为此提供了解决方案。

Method: 提出Chartwin方法，结合定位导向的信道图与动态DNT，通过半监督学习构建空间一致性地图。

Result: 静态DNT的定位误差约为4.5米，动态DNT约为6米，验证了DNT辅助信道图与定位的有效性。

Conclusion: Chartwin方法在构建空间一致性信道图和定位方面表现优异，为DNT辅助通信任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Wireless communication systems can significantly benefit from the
availability of spatially consistent representations of the wireless channel to
efficiently perform a wide range of communication tasks. Towards this purpose,
channel charting has been introduced as an effective unsupervised learning
technique to achieve both locally and globally consistent radio maps. In this
letter, we propose Chartwin, a case study on the integration of
localization-oriented channel charting with dynamic Digital Network Twins
(DNTs). Numerical results showcase the significant performance of
semi-supervised channel charting in constructing a spatially consistent chart
of the considered extended urban environment. The considered method results in
$\approx$ 4.5 m localization error for the static DNT and $\approx$ 6 m in the
dynamic DNT, fostering DNT-aided channel charting and localization.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ReQuestNet的新型神经网络架构，用于5G及更高版本的信道估计，显著简化了估计流程，并在多种信道条件下优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统线性MMSE解决方案的局限性，如依赖其他参考信号和无法联合处理未知预编码的信道，同时满足无线通信系统的实际需求。

Method: ReQuestNet由CoarseNet和RefinementNet两个子单元组成，分别进行粗略估计和细化估计，利用PRG间和MIMO空间维度的相关性。

Result: 仿真结果显示，ReQuestNet在多种信道条件下显著优于传统MMSE方法，最高可实现10dB增益，并能有效泛化到未见过的信道配置。

Conclusion: ReQuestNet是一种高效且灵活的信道估计方法，适用于动态无线通信环境，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel neural architecture for channel estimation
(CE) in 5G and beyond, the Recurrent Equivariant UERS Estimation Network
(ReQuestNet). It incorporates several practical considerations in wireless
communication systems, such as ability to handle variable number of resource
block (RB), dynamic number of transmit layers, physical resource block groups
(PRGs) bundling size (BS), demodulation reference signal (DMRS) patterns with a
single unified model, thereby, drastically simplifying the CE pipeline. Besides
it addresses several limitations of the legacy linear MMSE solutions, for
example, by being independent of other reference signals and particularly by
jointly processing MIMO layers and differently precoded channels with unknown
precoding at the receiver. ReQuestNet comprises of two sub-units, CoarseNet
followed by RefinementNet. CoarseNet performs per PRG, per transmit-receive
(Tx-Rx) stream channel estimation, while RefinementNet refines the CoarseNet
channel estimate by incorporating correlations across differently precoded
PRGs, and correlation across multiple input multiple output (MIMO) channel
spatial dimensions (cross-MIMO). Simulation results demonstrate that ReQuestNet
significantly outperforms genie minimum mean squared error (MMSE) CE across a
wide range of channel conditions, delay-Doppler profiles, achieving up to 10dB
gain at high SNRs. Notably, ReQuestNet generalizes effectively to unseen
channel profiles, efficiently exploiting inter-PRG and cross-MIMO correlations
under dynamic PRG BS and varying transmit layer allocations.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种将大型语言模型分离部署在云端和设备上的方法（P/D-Device），以解决云端资源占用时间长和设备计算能力有限的问题，显著降低了首次响应时间（TTFT）并提升了云端吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业实践中，大型语言模型的解耦部署虽提升了性能，但解码阶段生成过多令牌会长期占用云端资源，降低吞吐量；同时，设备资源有限导致预填充阶段延迟（TTFT）随提示长度增加而显著上升。

Method: 提出将大型语言模型分离部署在云端和设备上，云端仅在预填充阶段辅助设备。设备在接收到云端首个令牌后立即响应用户以降低TTFT，后续令牌通过速度控制器平滑输出时间（TPOT），同时设备逐步完成预填充。云端预填充阶段还可优化提示以加速设备推理。

Result: 实验表明，TTFT降低至少60%，最大TPOT为数十毫秒，云端吞吐量提升高达15倍。

Conclusion: P/D-Device方案有效解决了云端资源占用和设备计算能力的瓶颈，显著提升了系统性能。

Abstract: Serving disaggregated large language models has been widely adopted in
industrial practice for enhanced performance. However, too many tokens
generated in decoding phase, i.e., occupying the resources for a long time,
essentially hamper the cloud from achieving a higher throughput. Meanwhile, due
to limited on-device resources, the time to first token (TTFT), i.e., the
latency of prefill phase, increases dramatically with the growth on prompt
length. In order to concur with such a bottleneck on resources, i.e., long
occupation in cloud and limited on-device computing capacity, we propose to
separate large language model between cloud and devices. That is, the cloud
helps a portion of the content for each device, only in its prefill phase.
Specifically, after receiving the first token from the cloud, decoupling with
its own prefill, the device responds to the user immediately for a lower TTFT.
Then, the following tokens from cloud are presented via a speed controller for
smoothed TPOT (the time per output token), until the device catches up with the
progress. On-device prefill is then amortized using received tokens while the
resource usage in cloud is controlled. Moreover, during cloud prefill, the
prompt can be refined, using those intermediate data already generated, to
further speed up on-device inference. We implement such a scheme P/D-Device,
and confirm its superiority over other alternatives. We further propose an
algorithm to decide the best settings. Real-trace experiments show that TTFT
decreases at least 60%, maximum TPOT is about tens of milliseconds, and cloud
throughput increases by up to 15x.

*Yuvraj Dutta,Soumyajit Chatterjee,Sandip Chakraborty,Basabdatta Palit*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 本文首次对联邦学习（FL）策略在5G边缘场景中的吞吐量预测进行了全面基准测试，评估了三种聚合算法和四种时间序列架构，发现FedBN在非IID条件下表现稳健，LSTM和Transformer模型优于CNN基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 5G和6G网络中，准确且自适应的网络吞吐量预测对延迟敏感和高带宽应用至关重要，但现有方法在异构移动环境中适用性有限。

Method: 评估了FedAvg、FedProx和FedBN三种聚合算法，以及LSTM、CNN、CNN+LSTM和Transformer四种时间序列架构，使用五个真实数据集分析客户端异质性、队列大小和历史窗口长度的影响。

Result: FedBN在非IID条件下表现稳健，LSTM和Transformer模型在R2分数上优于CNN基线80%。Transformer收敛速度更快但需要更长历史窗口，LSTM在准确性、轮次和时间占用上表现平衡。

Conclusion: 基于FL的预测框架在实时自适应流媒体中验证了其端到端适用性，FedBN结合LSTM或Transformer显著提升了QoE分数，为下一代无线网络提供了可扩展、隐私保护的吞吐量预测系统。

Abstract: Accurate and adaptive network throughput prediction is essential for
latency-sensitive and bandwidth-intensive applications in 5G and emerging 6G
networks. However, most existing methods rely on centralized training with
uniformly collected data, limiting their applicability in heterogeneous mobile
environments with non-IID data distributions. This paper presents the first
comprehensive benchmarking of federated learning (FL) strategies for throughput
prediction in realistic 5G edge scenarios. We evaluate three aggregation
algorithms - FedAvg, FedProx, and FedBN - across four time-series
architectures: LSTM, CNN, CNN+LSTM, and Transformer, using five diverse
real-world datasets. We systematically analyze the effects of client
heterogeneity, cohort size, and history window length on prediction
performance. Our results reveal key trade-offs among model complexities,
convergence rates, and generalization. It is found that FedBN consistently
delivers robust performance under non-IID conditions. On the other hand, LSTM
and Transformer models outperform CNN-based baselines by up to 80% in R2
scores. Moreover, although Transformers converge in half the rounds of LSTM,
they require longer history windows to achieve a high R2, indicating higher
context dependence. LSTM is, therefore, found to achieve a favorable balance
between accuracy, rounds, and temporal footprint. To validate the end-to-end
applicability of the framework, we have integrated our FL-based predictors into
a live adaptive streaming pipeline. It is seen that FedBN-based LSTM and
Transformer models improve mean QoE scores by 11.7% and 11.4%, respectively,
over FedAvg, while also reducing the variance. These findings offer actionable
insights for building scalable, privacy-preserving, and edge-aware throughput
prediction systems in next-generation wireless networks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于copula的因果图形归一化流（ρ-GNF）方法，用于因果推断中对未观测混杂的敏感性分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决因果推断中未观测混杂对平均因果效应（ACE）估计的影响。

Method: 使用ρ-GNF模型，通过高斯copula建模混杂强度，生成ρ曲线以评估ACE的边界。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能有效评估混杂强度对ACE的影响，并提供可信区间。

Conclusion: ρ-GNF为因果推断中的敏感性分析提供了灵活且可靠的工具。

Abstract: We propose a novel method for sensitivity analysis to unobserved confounding
in causal inference. The method builds on a copula-based causal graphical
normalizing flow that we term $\rho$-GNF, where $\rho \in [-1,+1]$ is the
sensitivity parameter. The parameter represents the non-causal association
between exposure and outcome due to unobserved confounding, which is modeled as
a Gaussian copula. In other words, the $\rho$-GNF enables scholars to estimate
the average causal effect (ACE) as a function of $\rho$, accounting for various
confounding strengths. The output of the $\rho$-GNF is what we term the
$\rho_{curve}$, which provides the bounds for the ACE given an interval of
assumed $\rho$ values. The $\rho_{curve}$ also enables scholars to identify the
confounding strength required to nullify the ACE. We also propose a Bayesian
version of our sensitivity analysis method. Assuming a prior over the
sensitivity parameter $\rho$ enables us to derive the posterior distribution
over the ACE, which enables us to derive credible intervals. Finally,
leveraging on experiments from simulated and real-world data, we show the
benefits of our sensitivity analysis method.

Conclusion: Capybara展示了AI和AR技术在儿童创造力培养中的潜力，为未来的教育工具设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Despite their potential to enhance children's learning experiences,
AI-enabled AR technologies are predominantly used in ways that position
children as consumers rather than creators. We introduce Capybara, an AR-based
and AI-powered visual programming environment that empowers children to create,
customize, and program 3D characters overlaid onto the physical world. Capybara
enables children to create virtual characters and accessories using text-to-3D
generative AI models, and to animate these characters through auto-rigging and
body tracking. In addition, our system employs vision-based AI models to
recognize physical objects, allowing children to program interactive behaviors
between virtual characters and their physical surroundings. We demonstrate the
expressiveness of Capybara through a set of novel AR experiences. We conducted
user studies with 20 children in the United States and Argentina. Our findings
suggest that Capybara can empower children to harness AI in authoring
personalized and engaging AR experiences that seamlessly bridge the virtual and
physical worlds.

to impose AI use in both personal and professional contexts: imposing AI
features in interfaces at the expense of existing non-AI features and promoting
narratives about AI that make it harder to resist using it. We discuss
opportunities for regulating the imposed adoption of AI features, which would

Abstract: Surrogate modeling for systems with high-dimensional quantities of interest
remains challenging, particularly when training data are costly to acquire.
This work develops multifidelity methods for multiple-input multiple-output
linear regression targeting data-limited applications with high-dimensional
outputs. Multifidelity methods integrate many inexpensive low-fidelity model
evaluations with limited, costly high-fidelity evaluations. We introduce two
projection-based multifidelity linear regression approaches that leverage
principal component basis vectors for dimensionality reduction and combine
multifidelity data through: (i) a direct data augmentation using low-fidelity
data, and (ii) a data augmentation incorporating explicit linear corrections
between low-fidelity and high-fidelity data. The data augmentation approaches
combine high-fidelity and low-fidelity data into a unified training set and
train the linear regression model through weighted least squares with
fidelity-specific weights. Various weighting schemes and their impact on
regression accuracy are explored. The proposed multifidelity linear regression
methods are demonstrated on approximating the surface pressure field of a
hypersonic vehicle in flight. In a low-data regime of no more than ten
high-fidelity samples, multifidelity linear regression achieves approximately
3% - 12% improvement in median accuracy compared to single-fidelity methods
with comparable computational cost.

Conclusion: ICL在多类分类中具有理论最优性，且不仅限于transformer架构，MLPs也能有效实现ICL。

Abstract: This paper investigates the expected excess risk of In-Context Learning (ICL)
for multiclass classification. We model each task as a sequence of labeled
prompt samples and a query input, where a pre-trained model estimates the
conditional class probabilities of the query. The expected excess risk is
defined as the average truncated Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the
predicted and ground-truth conditional class distributions, averaged over a
specified family of tasks. We establish a new oracle inequality for the
expected excess risk based on KL divergence in multiclass classification. This
allows us to derive tight upper and lower bounds for the expected excess risk
in transformer-based models, demonstrating that the ICL estimator achieves the
minimax optimal rate - up to a logarithmic factor - for conditional probability
estimation. From a technical standpoint, our results introduce a novel method
for controlling generalization error using the uniform empirical covering
entropy of the log-likelihood function class. Furthermore, we show that
multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) can also perform ICL and achieve this optimal
rate under specific assumptions, suggesting that transformers may not be the
exclusive architecture capable of effective ICL.

Method: 提出Hierarchical-CPI，通过层次树分组探索变量，结合树基重要性分配机制，控制家族错误率并保持计算效率。

Result: 在ADNI和TDBRAIN数据集中验证了方法的有效性，能够识别生物学上合理的变量。

Conclusion: Hierarchical-CPI为高相关性医学影像数据提供了一种高效且可解释的变量重要性分析方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have greatly expanded the repertoire of
predictive methods for medical imaging. However, the interpretability of
complex models remains a challenge, which limits their utility in medical
applications. Recently, model-agnostic methods have been proposed to measure
conditional variable importance and accommodate complex non-linear models.
However, they often lack power when dealing with highly correlated data, a
common problem in medical imaging. We introduce Hierarchical-CPI, a
model-agnostic variable importance measure that frames the inference problem as
the discovery of groups of variables that are jointly predictive of the
outcome. By exploring subgroups along a hierarchical tree, it remains
computationally tractable, yet also enjoys explicit family-wise error rate
control. Moreover, we address the issue of vanishing conditional importance
under high correlation with a tree-based importance allocation mechanism. We
benchmarked Hierarchical-CPI against state-of-the-art variable importance
methods. Its effectiveness is demonstrated in two neuroimaging datasets:
classifying dementia diagnoses from MRI data (ADNI dataset) and analyzing the
Berger effect on EEG data (TDBRAIN dataset), identifying biologically plausible
variables.

Result: PC利用局部信息更新权重，具有自动梯度缩放等理论优势。

Conclusion: PC是一种有前景的生物可信替代方案，适用于神经网络训练。

Abstract: Backpropagation (BP) of errors is the backbone training algorithm for
artificial neural networks (ANNs). It updates network weights through gradient
descent to minimize a loss function representing the mismatch between
predictions and desired outputs. BP uses the chain rule to propagate the loss
gradient backward through the network hierarchy, allowing efficient weight
updates. However, this process requires weight updates at every layer to rely
on a global error signal generated at the network's output.
  In contrast, the Hebbian model of synaptic plasticity states that weight
updates are local, depending only on the activity of pre- and post-synaptic
neurons. This suggests biological brains likely do not implement BP directly.
Recently, Predictive Coding (PC) has gained interest as a biologically
plausible alternative that updates weights using only local information.
Originating from 1950s work on signal compression, PC was later proposed as a
model of the visual cortex and formalized under the free energy principle,
linking it to Bayesian inference and dynamical systems. PC weight updates rely
solely on local information and provide theoretical advantages such as
automatic scaling of gradients based on uncertainty.
  This lecture notes column offers a novel, tutorial-style introduction to PC,
focusing on its formulation, derivation, and connections to well-known
optimization and signal processing algorithms such as BP and the Kalman Filter
(KF). It aims to support existing literature by guiding readers from the
mathematical foundations of PC to practical implementation, including Python
examples using PyTorch.

Motivation: 现有的对话信息检索系统通常采用一刀切的个性化策略，未能区分不同查询对个性化的需求，可能导致效果不佳。

Method: APCIR首先识别查询所需的个性化级别，生成多种增强查询，并通过动态权重分配融合这些查询。

Result: 在TREC iKAT数据集上的实验表明，APCIR优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 自适应个性化方法APCIR能有效提升对话信息检索系统的性能。

Abstract: Personalized conversational information retrieval (CIR) systems aim to
satisfy users' complex information needs through multi-turn interactions by
considering user profiles. However, not all search queries require
personalization. The challenge lies in appropriately incorporating
personalization elements into search when needed. Most existing studies
implicitly incorporate users' personal information and conversational context
using large language models without distinguishing the specific requirements
for each query turn. Such a ``one-size-fits-all'' personalization strategy
might lead to sub-optimal results. In this paper, we propose an adaptive
personalization method, in which we first identify the required personalization
level for a query and integrate personalized queries with other query
reformulations to produce various enhanced queries. Then, we design a
personalization-aware ranking fusion approach to assign fusion weights
dynamically to different reformulated queries, depending on the required
personalization level. The proposed adaptive personalized conversational
information retrieval framework APCIR is evaluated on two TREC iKAT datasets.
The results confirm the effectiveness of adaptive personalization of APCIR by
outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Result: 实验结果显示，ReLSum在召回率、NDCG等离线指标以及在线用户参与度上均有显著提升。

Conclusion: ReLSum为大规模电子商务系统提供了一种可扩展且高效的搜索相关性增强解决方案。

Abstract: E-commerce search engines often rely solely on product titles as input for
ranking models with latency constraints. However, this approach can result in
suboptimal relevance predictions, as product titles often lack sufficient
detail to capture query intent. While product descriptions provide richer
information, their verbosity and length make them unsuitable for real-time
ranking, particularly for computationally expensive architectures like
cross-encoder ranking models. To address this challenge, we propose ReLSum, a
novel reinforcement learning framework designed to generate concise,
query-relevant summaries of product descriptions optimized for search
relevance. ReLSum leverages relevance scores as rewards to align the objectives
of summarization and ranking, effectively overcoming limitations of prior
methods, such as misaligned learning targets. The framework employs a trainable
large language model (LLM) to produce summaries, which are then used as input
for a cross-encoder ranking model. Experimental results demonstrate significant
improvements in offline metrics, including recall and NDCG, as well as online
user engagement metrics. ReLSum provides a scalable and efficient solution for
enhancing search relevance in large-scale e-commerce systems.

*Milad Sabouri,Masoud Mansoury,Kun Lin,Bamshad Mobasher*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的用户画像方法LLM-TUP，通过时间戳和自然语言表示动态建模长短期用户偏好，显著提升了推荐系统性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有用户画像方法过于简单，无法捕捉用户偏好的动态性和长短期交互，亟需更精细的建模方法。

Method: 利用LLM生成用户历史的自然语言表示，结合时间戳和BERT编码，通过注意力机制动态融合长短期偏好。

Result: 在真实数据集上，LLM-TUP显著优于基线方法，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: LLM-TUP通过语义丰富的用户画像和时间感知建模，为个性化推荐提供了新思路。

Abstract: Accurately modeling user preferences is crucial for improving the performance
of content-based recommender systems. Existing approaches often rely on
simplistic user profiling methods, such as averaging or concatenating item
embeddings, which fail to capture the nuanced nature of user preference
dynamics, particularly the interactions between long-term and short-term
preferences. In this work, we propose LLM-driven Temporal User Profiling
(LLM-TUP), a novel method for user profiling that explicitly models short-term
and long-term preferences by leveraging interaction timestamps and generating
natural language representations of user histories using a large language model
(LLM). These representations are encoded into high-dimensional embeddings using
a pre-trained BERT model, and an attention mechanism is applied to dynamically
fuse the short-term and long-term embeddings into a comprehensive user profile.
Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that LLM-TUP achieves
substantial improvements over several baselines, underscoring the effectiveness
of our temporally aware user-profiling approach and the use of semantically
rich user profiles, generated by LLMs, for personalized content-based
recommendation.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLM）在生成时间感知用户画像中的有效性，区分短期和长期偏好，并评估其在推荐系统中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统用户画像难以捕捉用户偏好的动态时间上下文，如短期兴趣和长期口味的变化。

Method: 通过LLM生成语义丰富、时间感知的用户画像，动态融合短期和长期偏好为综合用户嵌入。

Result: 在密集领域（如电影&电视）效果显著，但在稀疏领域（如视频游戏）改进有限，效果依赖于用户交互历史的丰富性。

Conclusion: LLM在增强用户画像方面具有潜力，但实际应用需考虑数据集特性。

Abstract: Effective recommender systems demand dynamic user understanding, especially
in complex, evolving environments. Traditional user profiling often fails to
capture the nuanced, temporal contextual factors of user preferences, such as
transient short-term interests and enduring long-term tastes. This paper
presents an assessment of Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating
semantically rich, time-aware user profiles. We do not propose a novel
end-to-end recommendation architecture; instead, the core contribution is a
systematic investigation into the degree of LLM effectiveness in capturing the
dynamics of user context by disentangling short-term and long-term preferences.
This approach, framing temporal preferences as dynamic user contexts for
recommendations, adaptively fuses these distinct contextual components into
comprehensive user embeddings. The evaluation across Movies&TV and Video Games
domains suggests that while LLM-generated profiles offer semantic depth and
temporal structure, their effectiveness for context-aware recommendations is
notably contingent on the richness of user interaction histories. Significant
gains are observed in dense domains (e.g., Movies&TV), whereas improvements are
less pronounced in sparse environments (e.g., Video Games). This work
highlights LLMs' nuanced potential in enhancing user profiling for adaptive,
context-aware recommendations, emphasizing the critical role of dataset
characteristics for practical applicability.

Motivation: 传统离线指标存在曝光偏差，而在线方法如A/B测试成本高且操作受限，尤其在长音频领域（如播客）中。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：首先从90天的收听历史中构建自然语言用户画像，再通过LLM基于画像与推荐内容的匹配进行细粒度评估。

Result: 在47名参与者的对照研究中，该方法与人类评估高度一致，且优于或等同于使用原始收听历史的变体。

Conclusion: 该框架为推荐系统提供了高效、可解释的评估方法，支持迭代测试和模型选择。

Abstract: Evaluating personalized recommendations remains a central challenge,
especially in long-form audio domains like podcasts, where traditional offline
metrics suffer from exposure bias and online methods such as A/B testing are
costly and operationally constrained. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as offline judges to
assess the quality of podcast recommendations in a scalable and interpretable
manner. Our two-stage profile-aware approach first constructs natural-language
user profiles distilled from 90 days of listening history. These profiles
summarize both topical interests and behavioral patterns, serving as compact,
interpretable representations of user preferences. Rather than prompting the
LLM with raw data, we use these profiles to provide high-level, semantically
rich context-enabling the LLM to reason more effectively about alignment
between a user's interests and recommended episodes. This reduces input
complexity and improves interpretability. The LLM is then prompted to deliver
fine-grained pointwise and pairwise judgments based on the profile-episode
match. In a controlled study with 47 participants, our profile-aware judge
matched human judgments with high fidelity and outperformed or matched a
variant using raw listening histories. The framework enables efficient,
profile-aware evaluation for iterative testing and model selection in
recommender systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SPARC的新型检索框架，通过动态离散兴趣空间和概率兴趣模块，解决了多兴趣检索中的静态兴趣和被动匹配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多兴趣检索方法存在兴趣静态化和被动匹配的问题，无法动态适应用户实时偏好或探索新兴趣。

Method: 利用RQ-VAE构建离散兴趣空间，结合工业级推荐模型进行联合训练，并引入概率兴趣模块实现软搜索策略。

Result: 在线A/B测试显示用户观看时长增加0.9%，页面浏览量增加0.4%，PV500提升22.7%；离线评估在Recall@K和NDCG@K指标上也有提升。

Conclusion: SPARC框架通过动态兴趣建模和主动探索，显著提升了推荐效果和业务指标。

Abstract: Modeling multi-interests has arisen as a core problem in real-world RS.
Current multi-interest retrieval methods pose three major challenges: 1)
Interests, typically extracted from predefined external knowledge, are
invariant. Failed to dynamically evolve with users' real-time consumption
preferences. 2) Online inference typically employs an over-exploited strategy,
mainly matching users' existing interests, lacking proactive exploration and
discovery of novel and long-tail interests. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel retrieval framework named SPARC(Soft Probabilistic Adaptive
Retrieval Model via Codebooks). Our contribution is two folds. First, the
framework utilizes Residual Quantized Variational Autoencoder (RQ-VAE) to
construct a discretized interest space. It achieves joint training of the
RQ-VAE with the industrial large scale recommendation model, mining
behavior-aware interests that can perceive user feedback and evolve
dynamically. Secondly, a probabilistic interest module that predicts the
probability distribution over the entire dynamic and discrete interest space.
This facilitates an efficient "soft-search" strategy during online inference,
revolutionizing the retrieval paradigm from "passive matching" to "proactive
exploration" and thereby effectively promoting interest discovery. Online A/B
tests on an industrial platform with tens of millions daily active users, have
achieved substantial gains in business metrics: +0.9% increase in user view
duration, +0.4% increase in user page views (PV), and a +22.7% improvement in
PV500(new content reaching 500 PVs in 24 hours). Offline evaluations are
conducted on open-source Amazon Product datasets. Metrics, such as Recall@K and
Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain@K(NDCG@K), also showed consistent
improvement. Both online and offline experiments validate the efficacy and
practical value of the proposed method.

Motivation: 预疏散阶段对整体疏散时间至关重要，但人类认知过程的复杂性使其难以研究。本文旨在通过建模理解预疏散时间如何从个体互动中产生。

Method: 提出了一个二元决策过程模型，结合意见动力学和二元相变，模拟社会背景下多人的预疏散时间。模型参数与社会心理学因素相关。

Result: 模型能够描述预疏散时间的涌现现象，并模拟平面空间中多人的集体运动，类似于Vicsek模型。

Conclusion: 该建模框架有助于理解社会背景下的复杂人群行为，为疏散研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: In crowd evacuation the time interval before decisive movement towards a safe
place is defined as the pre-evacuation phase, and it has crucial impact on the
total time required to safe egress. This process mainly refers to situation
awareness and response to an external stressors, e.g., fire alarm. Due to the
complexity of human cognitive process, stimulation is widely used to study this
important time interval. In this paper a binary decision process is formulated
to simulate pre-evacuation time of many evacuees in a given social context. The
model combines classic opinion dynamics with binary phase transition to
describe how pre-evacuation time emerges from individual interaction. The model
parameters are conceptually meaningful to human factors research within
socio-psychological background, e.g., whether an individual is stubborn or
open-minded, or what kind of the social topology exists among the individuals
and how it matters in aggregating individuals into social groups. The modeling
framework also describes collective motion of many evacuees in a planar space,
and the resulting multi-agent system is partly similar to Vicsek model, and it
is meaningful to explore complex crowd behavior in social context.

Conclusion: 提出了开发综合评估指标的基础框架，以更全面评估插补性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in wearable technology have enabled the continuous monitoring
of vital physiological signals, essential for predictive modeling and early
detection of extreme physiological events. Among these physiological signals,
heart rate (HR) plays a central role, as it is widely used in monitoring and
managing cardiovascular conditions and detecting extreme physiological events
such as hypoglycemia. However, data from wearable devices often suffer from
missing values. To address this issue, recent studies have employed various
imputation techniques. Traditionally, the effectiveness of these methods has
been evaluated using predictive accuracy metrics such as RMSE, MAPE, and MAE,
which assess numerical proximity to the original data. While informative, these
metrics fail to capture the complex statistical structure inherent in
physiological signals. This study bridges this gap by presenting a
comprehensive evaluation of four statistical imputation methods, linear
interpolation, K Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Piecewise Cubic Hermite Interpolating
Polynomial (PCHIP), and B splines, for short term HR data gaps. We assess their
performance using both predictive accuracy metrics and statistical distance
measures, including the Cohen Distance Test (CDT) and Jensen Shannon Distance
(JS Distance), applied to HR data from the D1NAMO dataset and the BIG IDEAs Lab
Glycemic Variability and Wearable Device dataset. The analysis reveals
limitations in existing imputation approaches and the absence of a robust
framework for evaluating imputation quality in physiological signals. Finally,
this study proposes a foundational framework to develop a composite evaluation
metric to assess imputation performance.

Result: 模拟重现了实验中的种群轨迹，支持了假设。

Conclusion: 社会层级可见性过高导致熵退化，可能是种群崩溃的关键因素。

Abstract: Calhoun's Rat Utopia experiments demonstrated a puzzling population
trajectory: initial growth, plateau, and eventually a total collapse of the rat
population despite abundant resources. This paper proposes a hypothesis that
the enclosure's design enabled full visibility of the social hierarchy (pecking
order), leading to entropy degeneration: progressive loss of uncertainty in
rats' perceived ranks over generations. High initial uncertainty drives
engagement in dominance, reproduction, and care; as visibility solidifies the
hierarchy over the generations, uncertainty vanishes, nullifying perceived
gains from social activities. Simulations reproduce the experimental arc which
rely on a game theoretic matrix that is parameterized by the uncertainty
(entropy) in the hierarchy which changes over rat generations.

Abstract: Quantum computing and machine learning are state-of-the-art technologies
which have been investigated intensively in both academia and industry. The
hybrid technology of these two ingredients is expected to be a powerful tool to
solve complex problems in many branches of science and engineering such as
combinatorial optimization problems and accelerate the creation of
next-generation technologies. In this work, we develop an algorithm to solve a
black-box optimization problem by improving Factorization Machine Annealing
(FMA) such that the training of a machine learning model called Factorization
Machine is performed not by a full dataset but by a subdataset which is sampled
from a full dataset: Subsampling Factorization Machine Annealing (SFMA).
According to such a probabilistic training process, the performance of FMA on
exploring a solution space gets enhanced. As a result, SFMA exhibits balanced
performance of exploration and exploitation which we call
exploitation-exploration functionality. We conduct numerical benchmarking tests
to compare the performance of SFMA with that of FMA. Consequently, SFMA
certainly exhibits the exploration-exploitation functionality and outperforms
FMA in speed and accuracy. In addition, the performance of SFMA can be further
improved by sequentially using two subsampling datasets with different sizes
such that the size of the latter dataset is substantially smaller than the
former. Such a substantial reduction not only enhances the exploration
performance of SFMA but also enables us to run it with correspondingly low
computational cost even for a large-scale problem. These results indicate the
effectiveness of SFMA in a certain class of black-box optimization problems of
significant size: the potential scalability of SFMA in solving large-scale
problems with correspondingly low computational cost.

Abstract: A quantum thermodynamic system is described by a Hamiltonian and a list of
conserved, non-commuting charges, and a fundamental goal is to determine the
minimum energy of the system subject to constraints on the charges. Recently,
[Liu et al., arXiv:2505.04514] proposed first- and second-order classical and
hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for solving a dual chemical potential
maximization problem, and they proved that these algorithms converge to global
optima by means of gradient-ascent approaches. In this paper, we benchmark
these algorithms on several problems of interest in thermodynamics, including
one- and two-dimensional quantum Heisenberg models with nearest and
next-to-nearest neighbor interactions and with the charges set to the total
$x$, $y$, and $z$ magnetizations. We also offer an alternative compelling
interpretation of these algorithms as methods for designing ground and thermal
states of controllable Hamiltonians, with potential applications in molecular
and material design. Furthermore, we introduce stabilizer thermodynamic systems
as thermodynamic systems based on stabilizer codes, with the Hamiltonian
constructed from a given code's stabilizer operators and the charges
constructed from the code's logical operators. We benchmark the aforementioned
algorithms on several examples of stabilizer thermodynamic systems, including
those constructed from the one-to-three-qubit repetition code, the perfect
one-to-five-qubit code, and the two-to-four-qubit error-detecting code.
Finally, we observe that the aforementioned hybrid quantum-classical
algorithms, when applied to stabilizer thermodynamic systems, can serve as
alternative methods for encoding qubits into stabilizer codes at a fixed
temperature, and we provide an effective method for warm-starting these
encoding algorithms whenever a single qubit is encoded into multiple physical
qubits.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in automating code generation
and software engineering tasks, yet they often struggle with complex,
multi-file projects due to context limitations and knowledge gaps. We propose a
novel context engineering workflow that combines multiple AI components: an
Intent Translator (GPT-5) for clarifying user requirements, an Elicit-powered
semantic literature retrieval for injecting domain knowledge, NotebookLM-based
document synthesis for contextual understanding, and a Claude Code multi-agent
system for code generation and validation. Our integrated approach leverages
intent clarification, retrieval-augmented generation, and specialized
sub-agents orchestrated via Claude's agent framework. We demonstrate that this
method significantly improves the accuracy and reliability of code assistants
in real-world repositories, yielding higher single-shot success rates and
better adherence to project context than baseline single-agent approaches.
Qualitative results on a large Next.js codebase show the multi-agent system
effectively plans, edits, and tests complex features with minimal human
intervention. We compare our system with recent frameworks like CodePlan,
MASAI, and HyperAgent, highlighting how targeted context injection and agent
role decomposition lead to state-of-the-art performance. Finally, we discuss
the implications for deploying LLM-based coding assistants in production, along
with lessons learned on context management and future research directions.

Conclusion: SLMs在能源效率上优于LLMs，适合对能耗敏感的场景。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for code generation. However,
commercial models like ChatGPT require significant computing power, which leads
to high energy use and carbon emissions. This has raised concerns about their
environmental impact. In this study, we evaluate open-source Small Language
Models (SLMs) trained explicitly for code generation and compare their
performance and energy efficiency against large LLMs and efficient
human-written Python code. The goal is to investigate whether SLMs can match
the performance of LLMs on certain types of programming problems while
producing more energy-efficient code. We evaluate 150 coding problems from
LeetCode, evenly distributed across three difficulty levels: easy, medium, and
hard. Our comparison includes three small open-source models, StableCode-3B,
StarCoderBase-3B, and Qwen2.5-Coder-3B-Instruct, and two large commercial
models, GPT-4.0 and DeepSeek-Reasoner. The generated code is evaluated using
four key metrics: run-time, memory usage, energy consumption, and correctness.
We use human-written solutions as a baseline to assess the quality and
efficiency of the model-generated code. Results indicate that LLMs achieve the
highest correctness across all difficulty levels, but SLMs are often more
energy-efficient when their outputs are correct. In over 52% of the evaluated

Abstract: Developers insert logging statements in source code to capture relevant
runtime information essential for maintenance and debugging activities. Log
level choice is an integral, yet tricky part of the logging activity as it
controls log verbosity and therefore influences systems' observability and
performance. Recent advances in ML-based log level prediction have leveraged
large language models (LLMs) to propose log level predictors (LLPs) that
demonstrated promising performance improvements (AUC between 0.64 and 0.8).
Nevertheless, current LLM-based LLPs rely on randomly selected in-context
examples, overlooking the structure and the diverse logging practices within
modern software projects. In this paper, we propose OmniLLP, a novel LLP
enhancement framework that clusters source files based on (1) semantic
similarity reflecting the code's functional purpose, and (2) developer
ownership cohesion. By retrieving in-context learning examples exclusively from
these semantic and ownership aware clusters, we aim to provide more coherent
prompts to LLPs leveraging LLMs, thereby improving their predictive accuracy.
Our results show that both semantic and ownership-aware clusterings
statistically significantly improve the accuracy (by up to 8\% AUC) of the
evaluated LLM-based LLPs compared to random predictors (i.e., leveraging
randomly selected in-context examples from the whole project). Additionally,
our approach that combines the semantic and ownership signal for in-context
prediction achieves an impressive 0.88 to 0.96 AUC across our evaluated
projects. Our findings highlight the value of integrating software
engineering-specific context, such as code semantic and developer ownership
signals into LLM-LLPs, offering developers a more accurate, contextually-aware
approach to logging and therefore, enhancing system maintainability and
observability.

Abstract: Language models have shown strong capabilities across a wide range of tasks
in software engineering, such as code generation, yet they suffer from
hallucinations. While hallucinations have been studied independently in natural
language and code generation, their occurrence in tasks involving code changes
which have a structurally complex and context-dependent format of code remains
largely unexplored. This paper presents the first comprehensive analysis of
hallucinations in two critical tasks involving code change to natural language
generation: commit message generation and code review comment generation. We
quantify the prevalence of hallucinations in recent language models and explore
a range of metric-based approaches to automatically detect them. Our findings
reveal that approximately 50\% of generated code reviews and 20\% of generated
commit messages contain hallucinations. Whilst commonly used metrics are weak
detectors on their own, combining multiple metrics substantially improves
performance. Notably, model confidence and feature attribution metrics
effectively contribute to hallucination detection, showing promise for
inference-time detection.\footnote{All code and data will be released upon
acceptance.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种可解释的AI模型，用于高精度预测核质量（或核结合能），其性能优于传统物理模型，并通过内部表示的双螺旋结构等发现增强了模型的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 核质量的高精度预测是核物理研究的重要目标，但现有AI模型因其黑箱特性难以评估外推预测的可靠性。本文旨在开发一种既精确又可解释的AI模型。

Method: 提出了一种新型AI模型，其内部表示具有双螺旋结构，类似于DNA的氢键连接，并将预测结果分层分解为与已知符号模型（如液滴模型）对应的项。

Result: 模型在核结合能预测上达到前沿精度，且改进主要源于Jaffe在1969年的观察。模型的可解释性通过双螺旋结构和分层分解得到验证。

Conclusion: 本文开发了一种完全可解释的数据驱动核质量模型，结合了AI的高精度和物理模型的透明度。

Abstract: Obtaining high-precision predictions of nuclear masses, or equivalently
nuclear binding energies, $E_b$, remains an important goal in nuclear-physics
research. Recently, many AI-based tools have shown promising results on this
task, some achieving precision that surpasses the best physics models. However,
the utility of these AI models remains in question given that predictions are
only useful where measurements do not exist, which inherently requires
extrapolation away from the training (and testing) samples. Since AI models are
largely black boxes, the reliability of such an extrapolation is difficult to
assess. We present an AI model that not only achieves cutting-edge precision
for $E_b$, but does so in an interpretable manner. For example, we find (and
explain why) that the most important dimensions of its internal representation
form a double helix, where the analog of the hydrogen bonds in DNA here link
the number of protons and neutrons found in the most stable nucleus of each
isotopic chain. Furthermore, we show that the AI prediction of $E_b$ can be
factorized and ordered hierarchically, with the most important terms
corresponding to well-known symbolic models (such as the famous liquid drop).
Remarkably, the improvement of the AI model over symbolic ones can almost
entirely be attributed to an observation made by Jaffe in 1969. The end result
is a fully interpretable data-driven model of nuclear masses.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补生成式AI在教育测试设计中应用的研究空白，验证AI生成题目的质量。

Method: 采用迭代优化策略，通过LLM生成、评估和改进题目，并在91个班级中进行大规模实地研究。

Result: 基于项目反应理论（IRT）的分析表明，AI生成的题目与专家设计的标准化考试题目表现相当。

Conclusion: AI能够高效生成高质量评估题目，为教师和学生提供便利。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) challenge conventional methods of teaching
and learning, they present an exciting opportunity to improve efficiency and
scale high-quality instruction. One promising application is the generation of
customized exams, tailored to specific course content. There has been
significant recent excitement on automatically generating questions using
artificial intelligence, but also comparatively little work evaluating the
psychometric quality of these items in real-world educational settings. Filling
this gap is an important step toward understanding generative AI's role in
effective test design. In this study, we introduce and evaluate an iterative
refinement strategy for question generation, repeatedly producing, assessing,
and improving questions through cycles of LLM-generated critique and revision.
We evaluate the quality of these AI-generated questions in a large-scale field
study involving 91 classes -- covering computer science, mathematics,
chemistry, and more -- in dozens of colleges across the United States,
comprising nearly 1700 students. Our analysis, based on item response theory
(IRT), suggests that for students in our sample the AI-generated questions
performed comparably to expert-created questions designed for standardized
exams. Our results illustrate the power of AI to make high-quality assessments
more readily available, benefiting both teachers and students.

Abstract: With the increasing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in all fields
and daily activities, a heated debate is found about the advantages and
challenges of AI and the need for navigating the concerns associated with AI to
make the best of it. To contribute to this literature and the ongoing debate
related to it, this study draws on the Monster theory to explain the
conflicting representation of AI. It suggests that studying monsters in popular
culture can provide an in-depth understanding of AI and its monstrous effects.
Specifically, this study aims to discuss AI perception and development through
the seven theses of Monster theory. The obtained results revealed that, just
like monsters, AI is complex in nature, and it should not be studied as a
separate entity but rather within a given society or culture. Similarly,
readers may perceive and interpret AI differently, just as readers may
interpret monsters differently. The relationship between AI and monsters, as
depicted in this study, does not seem to be as odd as it might be at first.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于多元道德规范的道德推理系统框架，旨在通过生成、筛选和权衡不同伦理观点来处理复杂道德情境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动机在于解决机器伦理中的道德推理问题，同时为价值对齐提供系统架构，将结构化道德推理与时间约束下的行动联系起来。

Method: 方法包括构建一个双层次混合架构：通用层通过自上而下和自下而上的学习定义道德阈值，局部层学习在上下文中权衡竞争性考虑并整合文化特定的规范内容。

Result: 结果是一个支持深度反思和实时响应的道德决策系统，适用于现实高风险情境。

Conclusion: 结论是该框架为复杂道德情境下的决策提供了透明且基于原则的方法，同时支持快速模型的训练。

Abstract: The conceptual framework proposed in this paper centers on the development of
a deliberative moral reasoning system - one designed to process complex moral
situations by generating, filtering, and weighing normative arguments drawn
from diverse ethical perspectives. While the framework is rooted in Machine
Ethics, it also makes a substantive contribution to Value Alignment by
outlining a system architecture that links structured moral reasoning to action
under time constraints. Grounded in normative moral pluralism, this system is
not constructed to imitate behavior but is built on reason-sensitive
deliberation over structured moral content in a transparent and principled
manner. Beyond its role as a deliberative system, it also serves as the
conceptual foundation for a novel two-level architecture: functioning as a
moral reasoning teacher envisioned to train faster models that support
real-time responsiveness without reproducing the full structure of deliberative
reasoning. Together, the deliberative and intuitive components are designed to
enable both deep reflection and responsive action. A key design feature is the
dual-hybrid structure: a universal layer that defines a moral threshold through
top-down and bottom-up learning, and a local layer that learns to weigh
competing considerations in context while integrating culturally specific
normative content, so long as it remains within the universal threshold. By
extending the notion of moral complexity to include not only conflicting
beliefs but also multifactorial dilemmas, multiple stakeholders, and the
integration of non-moral considerations, the framework aims to support morally
grounded decision-making in realistic, high-stakes contexts.

Motivation: 现有算法公平性研究主要关注敏感属性，忽视了社会决定因素的作用，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用基于区域的分析和Gamma分布参数化，建模社会决定因素对个体结果的影响。

Result: 方法定量重现了定性讨论中的细微发现，表明仅关注敏感属性的缓解策略可能引入新的结构性不公。

Conclusion: 综合考虑敏感属性和社会决定因素，能更全面地理解公平性，有效避免歧视。

Abstract: Social determinants are variables that, while not directly pertaining to any
specific individual, capture key aspects of contexts and environments that have
direct causal influences on certain attributes of an individual. Previous
algorithmic fairness literature has primarily focused on sensitive attributes,
often overlooking the role of social determinants. Our paper addresses this gap
by introducing formal and quantitative rigor into a space that has been shaped
largely by qualitative proposals regarding the use of social determinants. To
demonstrate theoretical perspectives and practical applicability, we examine a
concrete setting of college admissions, using region as a proxy for social
determinants. Our approach leverages a region-based analysis with Gamma
distribution parameterization to model how social determinants impact
individual outcomes. Despite its simplicity, our method quantitatively recovers
findings that resonate with nuanced insights in previous qualitative debates,
that are often missed by existing algorithmic fairness approaches. Our findings
suggest that mitigation strategies centering solely around sensitive attributes
may introduce new structural injustice when addressing existing discrimination.
Considering both sensitive attributes and social determinants facilitates a
more comprehensive explication of benefits and burdens experienced by
individuals from diverse demographic backgrounds as well as contextual
environments, which is essential for understanding and achieving fairness
effectively and transparently.

Motivation: 探讨AI公司在国际AI治理中的自愿承诺履行情况，以提供透明度和问责制。

Method: 基于2023年白宫八项自愿承诺制定评分标准，对16家公司的公开行为进行评分。

Result: 公司表现差异大，最高分83%（OpenAI），平均分52%，模型权重安全性平均分仅17%。

Conclusion: 未来AI治理需改进承诺披露的透明度和可验证性，并提出三项具体政策建议。

Abstract: Voluntary commitments are central to international AI governance, as
demonstrated by recent voluntary guidelines from the White House to the G7,
from Bletchley Park to Seoul. How do major AI companies make good on their
commitments? We score companies based on their publicly disclosed behavior by
developing a detailed rubric based on their eight voluntary commitments to the
White House in 2023. We find significant heterogeneity: while the
highest-scoring company (OpenAI) scores a 83% overall on our rubric, the
average score across all companies is just 52%. The companies demonstrate
systemically poor performance for their commitment to model weight security
with an average score of 17%: 11 of the 16 companies receive 0% for this
commitment. Our analysis highlights a clear structural shortcoming that future
AI governance initiatives should correct: when companies make public
commitments, they should proactively disclose how they meet their commitments
to provide accountability, and these disclosures should be verifiable. To
advance policymaking on corporate AI governance, we provide three directed
recommendations that address underspecified commitments, the role of complex AI
supply chains, and public transparency that could be applied towards AI
governance initiatives worldwide.

Result: 研究发现合成数据可能是匿名的，但需明确“合理可能风险”的定义。

Conclusion: 呼吁更明确的法规以促进AI在医疗领域的创新，同时保护隐私。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform healthcare, but
it requires access to health data. Synthetic data that is generated through
machine learning models trained on real data, offers a way to share data while
preserving privacy. However, uncertainties in the practical application of the
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) create an administrative burden,
limiting the benefits of synthetic data. Through a systematic analysis of
relevant legal sources and an empirical study, this article explores whether
synthetic data should be classified as personal data under the GDPR. The study
investigates the residual identification risk through generating synthetic data
and simulating inference attacks, challenging common perceptions of technical
identification risk. The findings suggest synthetic data is likely anonymous,
depending on certain factors, but highlights uncertainties about what
constitutes reasonably likely risk. To promote innovation, the study calls for
clearer regulations to balance privacy protection with the advancement of AI in
healthcare.

Conclusion: 提出了一种适用于领域专家访问受限环境的新型共同设计框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have the potential to address social and
behavioral determinants of health by transforming labor intensive workflows in
resource-constrained settings. Creating LLM-based applications that serve the
needs of underserved communities requires a deep understanding of their local
context, but it is often the case that neither LLMs nor their developers
possess this local expertise, and the experts in these communities often face
severe time/resource constraints. This creates a disconnect: how can one engage
in meaningful co-design of an LLM-based application for an under-resourced
community when the communication channel between the LLM developer and domain
expert is constrained? We explored this question through a real-world case
study, in which our data science team sought to partner with social workers at
a safety net hospital to build an LLM application that summarizes patients'
social needs. Whereas prior works focus on the challenge of prompt tuning, we
found that the most critical challenge in this setting is the careful and
precise specification of \what information to surface to providers so that the
LLM application is accurate, comprehensive, and verifiable. Here we present a
novel co-design framework for settings with limited access to domain experts,
in which the summary generation task is first decomposed into
individually-optimizable attributes and then each attribute is efficiently
refined and validated through a multi-tier cascading approach.

Abstract: As AI becomes more "agentic," it faces technical and socio-legal issues it
must address if it is to fulfill its promise of increased economic productivity
and efficiency. This paper uses technical and legal perspectives to explain how
things change when AI systems start being able to directly execute tasks on
behalf of a user. We show how technical conceptions of agents track some, but
not all, socio-legal conceptions of agency. That is, both computer science and
the law recognize the problems of under-specification for an agent, and both
disciplines have robust conceptions of how to address ensuring an agent does
what the programmer, or in the law, the principal desires and no more. However,
to date, computer science has under-theorized issues related to questions of
loyalty and to third parties that interact with an agent, both of which are
central parts of the law of agency. First, we examine the correlations between
implied authority in agency law and the principle of value-alignment in AI,
wherein AI systems must operate under imperfect objective specification.
Second, we reveal gaps in the current computer science view of agents
pertaining to the legal concepts of disclosure and loyalty, and how failure to
account for them can result in unintended effects in AI ecommerce agents. In
surfacing these gaps, we show a path forward for responsible AI agent
development and deployment.

Abstract: AI-powered scarce resource allocation policies rely on predictions to target
either specific individuals (e.g., high-risk) or settings (e.g.,
neighborhoods). Recent research on individual-level targeting demonstrates
conflicting results; some models show that targeting is not useful when
inequality is high, while other work demonstrates potential benefits. To study
and reconcile this apparent discrepancy, we develop a stylized framework based
on the Mallows model to understand how the spatial distribution of inequality
affects the effectiveness of door-to-door outreach policies. We introduce the
RENT (Relative Efficiency of Non-Targeting) metric, which we use to assess the
effectiveness of targeting approaches compared with neighborhood-based
approaches in preventing tenant eviction when high-risk households are more
versus less spatially concentrated. We then calibrate the model parameters to
eviction court records collected in a medium-sized city in the USA. Results
demonstrate considerable gains in the number of high-risk households canvassed
through individually targeted policies, even in a highly segregated metro area
with concentrated risks of eviction. We conclude that apparent discrepancies in
the prior literature can be reconciled by considering 1) the source of
deployment costs and 2) the observed versus modeled concentrations of risk. Our
results inform the deployment of AI-based solutions in social service provision
that account for particular applications and geographies.

Abstract: Due to perceptions of efficiency and significant productivity gains, various

institution-facing LLMs, collectively, Educational Large Language Models
(eLLMs), complement and enhance the effectiveness of teaching, learning, and
academic operations. However, their integration into an educational setting
raises significant cybersecurity concerns. A comprehensive landscape of
contemporary attacks on LLMs and their impact on the educational environment is
missing. This study presents a generalised taxonomy of fifty attacks on LLMs,
which are categorized as attacks targeting either models or their
infrastructure. The severity of these attacks is evaluated in the educational
sector using the DREAD risk assessment framework. Our risk assessment indicates
that token smuggling, adversarial prompts, direct injection, and multi-step
jailbreak are critical attacks on eLLMs. The proposed taxonomy, its application
in the educational environment, and our risk assessment will help academic and
industrial practitioners to build resilient solutions that protect learners and

Motivation: 自然灾害对商业土地利用的影响复杂且动态，现有模型难以捕捉这种变化。结合城市理论可以更有效地建模这种互动。

Method: 设计了Urban-STA4CLC模型，结合时空注意力机制和三个理论模块（韧性理论、空间经济理论和扩散理论）。

Conclusion: 将城市理论嵌入商业土地利用模型能显著提升预测能力，为考虑灾害累积影响和经济活动变化的研究提供了新方法。

Abstract: Natural disasters such as hurricanes and wildfires increasingly introduce
unusual disturbance on economic activities, which are especially likely to
reshape commercial land use pattern given their sensitive to customer
visitation. However, current modeling approaches are limited in capturing such
complex interplay between human activities and commercial land use change under
and following disturbances. Such interactions have been more effectively
captured in current resilient urban planning theories. This study designs and
calibrates a Urban Theory-Informed Spatio-Temporal Attention Model for
Predicting Post-Disaster Commercial Land Use Change (Urban-STA4CLC) to predict
both the yearly decline and expansion of commercial land use at census block
level under cumulative impact of disasters on human activities over two years.
Guided by urban theories, Urban-STA4CLC integrates both spatial and temporal
attention mechanisms with three theory-informed modules. Resilience theory
guides a disaster-aware temporal attention module that captures visitation
dynamics. Spatial economic theory informs a multi-relational spatial attention
module for inter-block representation. Diffusion theory contributes a
regularization term that constrains land use transitions. The model performs
significantly better than non-theoretical baselines in predicting commercial
land use change under the scenario of recurrent hurricanes, with around 19%
improvement in F1 score (0.8763). The effectiveness of the theory-guided
modules was further validated through ablation studies. The research
demonstrates that embedding urban theory into commercial land use modeling
models may substantially enhance the capacity to capture its gains and losses.
These advances in commercial land use modeling contribute to land use research
that accounts for cumulative impacts of recurrent disasters and shifts in
economic activity patterns.

Abstract: The rapid emergence of large language models (LLMs) has raised urgent
questions across the modern workforce about this new technology's strengths,
weaknesses, and capabilities. For privacy professionals, the question is
whether these AI systems can provide reliable support on regulatory compliance,
privacy program management, and AI governance. In this study, we evaluate ten
leading open and closed LLMs, including models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google
DeepMind, Meta, and DeepSeek, by benchmarking their performance on
industry-standard certification exams: CIPP/US, CIPM, CIPT, and AIGP from the
International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP). Each model was
tested using official sample exams in a closed-book setting and compared to
IAPP's passing thresholds. Our findings show that several frontier models such
as Gemini 2.5 Pro and OpenAI's GPT-5 consistently achieve scores exceeding the
standards for professional human certification - demonstrating substantial
expertise in privacy law, technical controls, and AI governance. The results
highlight both the strengths and domain-specific gaps of current LLMs and offer
practical insights for privacy officers, compliance leads, and technologists
assessing the readiness of AI tools for high-stakes data governance roles. This
paper provides an overview for professionals navigating the intersection of AI
advancement and regulatory risk and establishes a machine benchmark based on

Conclusion: TMC为DH领域提供了更深入的分析视角，揭示了技术与主题的复杂关系。

Abstract: Digital Humanities (DH) is an interdisciplinary field that integrates
computational methods with humanities scholarship to investigate innovative
topics. Each academic discipline follows a unique developmental path shaped by
the topics researchers investigate and the methods they employ. With the help
of bibliometric analysis, most of previous studies have examined DH across
multiple dimensions such as research hotspots, co-author networks, and
institutional rankings. However, these studies have often been limited in their
ability to provide deep insights into the current state of technological
advancements and topic development in DH. As a result, their conclusions tend
to remain superficial or lack interpretability in understanding how methods and
topics interrelate in the field. To address this gap, this study introduced a
new concept of Topic-Method Composition (TMC), which refers to a hybrid
knowledge structure generated by the co-occurrence of specific research topics
and the corresponding method. Especially by analyzing the interaction between
TMCs, we can see more clearly the intersection and integration of digital
technology and humanistic subjects in DH. Moreover, this study developed a
TMC-based workflow combining bibliometric analysis, topic modeling, and network
analysis to analyze the development characteristics and patterns of research
disciplines. By applying this workflow to large-scale bibliometric data, it

Abstract: With the advent of diffusion models, Text-to-Image (T2I) generation has seen
substantial advancements. Current T2I models allow users to specify object
colors using linguistic color names, and some methods aim to personalize
color-object association through prompt learning. However, existing models
struggle to provide comprehensive control over the color schemes of an entire
image, especially for background elements and less prominent objects not
explicitly mentioned in prompts. This paper proposes a novel approach to
enhance color scheme control by integrating color palettes as a separate
guidance mechanism alongside prompt instructions. We investigate the
effectiveness of palette guidance by exploring various palette representation
methods within a diffusion-based image colorization framework. To facilitate
this exploration, we construct specialized palette-text-image datasets and
conduct extensive quantitative and qualitative analyses. Our results
demonstrate that incorporating palette guidance significantly improves the
model's ability to generate images with desired color schemes, enabling a more
controlled and refined colorization process.

*Bo-Hsun Chen,Nevindu M. Batagoda,Dan Negrut*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: DiffPhysCam是一种可微分相机模拟器，支持机器人学和具身AI应用，通过梯度优化提升视觉感知性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有虚拟相机在控制相机设置、光学效果模拟和校准参数方面存在不足，限制了从模拟到现实的迁移能力。

Method: DiffPhysCam采用多阶段流程，精细控制相机设置，模拟光学效果（如散焦模糊），并支持真实数据校准，实现正向渲染和逆向渲染。

Result: DiffPhysCam提升了机器人感知性能，并通过逆向渲染创建了真实场景的数字孪生，用于自主地面车辆的导航。

Conclusion: DiffPhysCam为视觉感知和机器人训练提供了高效的模拟工具，支持从模拟到现实的迁移。

Abstract: We introduce DiffPhysCam, a differentiable camera simulator designed to
support robotics and embodied AI applications by enabling gradient-based
optimization in visual perception pipelines. Generating synthetic images that
closely mimic those from real cameras is essential for training visual models
and enabling end-to-end visuomotor learning. Moreover, differentiable rendering
allows inverse reconstruction of real-world scenes as digital twins,
facilitating simulation-based robotics training. However, existing virtual
cameras offer limited control over intrinsic settings, poorly capture optical
artifacts, and lack tunable calibration parameters -- hindering sim-to-real
transfer. DiffPhysCam addresses these limitations through a multi-stage
pipeline that provides fine-grained control over camera settings, models key
optical effects such as defocus blur, and supports calibration with real-world
data. It enables both forward rendering for image synthesis and inverse
rendering for 3D scene reconstruction, including mesh and material texture
optimization. We show that DiffPhysCam enhances robotic perception performance
in synthetic image tasks. As an illustrative example, we create a digital twin
of a real-world scene using inverse rendering, simulate it in a multi-physics
environment, and demonstrate navigation of an autonomous ground vehicle using
images generated by DiffPhysCam.

*Mutian Tong,Rundi Wu,Changxi Zheng*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出一种从单幅图像或视频中估计室内光照的方法，利用2D扩散先验优化MLP表示的光场，并通过微调预训练模型实现零样本泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决室内光照估计的复杂性和时空变化问题。

Method: 利用2D扩散先验优化MLP表示的光场，微调预训练模型以预测多位置光照。

Result: 在单幅图像或视频的光照估计中表现优于基线方法，并展示了时空一致性光照估计的结果。

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂光照条件下表现出色，尤其适用于真实场景视频。

Abstract: Indoor lighting estimation from a single image or video remains a challenge
due to its highly ill-posed nature, especially when the lighting condition of
the scene varies spatially and temporally. We propose a method that estimates
from an input video a continuous light field describing the spatiotemporally
varying lighting of the scene. We leverage 2D diffusion priors for optimizing
such light field represented as a MLP. To enable zero-shot generalization to
in-the-wild scenes, we fine-tune a pre-trained image diffusion model to predict
lighting at multiple locations by jointly inpainting multiple chrome balls as
light probes. We evaluate our method on indoor lighting estimation from a
single image or video and show superior performance over compared baselines.
Most importantly, we highlight results on spatiotemporally consistent lighting
estimation from in-the-wild videos, which is rarely demonstrated in previous
works.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种面部表演重定向方法，通过统一框架和体积变形技术，解决了不同面部框架间的语义匹配问题，并引入Simon-Says表达式校准和微调方法以提高重定向效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决面部表演重定向中不同框架语义匹配的困难，特别是在游戏或虚拟现实环境中。

Method: 使用统一框架（如3DMM、FLAME等）进行重定向，结合体积变形和Simon-Says表达式校准，并通过微调优化动画控制。

Result: 校准后的框架能生成期望的表情，但在跟踪表演时仍可能产生不理想的动画控制，微调方法显著提升了语义准确性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了面部重定向的语义匹配问题，尤其在游戏和VR环境中表现优异。

Abstract: In this paper, we consider retargeting a tracked facial performance to either
another person or to a virtual character in a game or virtual reality (VR)
environment. We remove the difficulties associated with identifying and
retargeting the semantics of one rig framework to another by utilizing the same
framework (3DMM, FLAME, MetaHuman, etc.) for both subjects. Although this does
not constrain the choice of framework when retargeting from one person to
another, it does force the tracker to use the game/VR character rig when
retargeting to a game/VR character. We utilize volumetric morphing in order to
fit facial rigs to both performers and targets; in addition, a carefully chosen
set of Simon-Says expressions is used to calibrate each rig to the motion
signatures of the relevant performer or target. Although a uniform set of
Simon-Says expressions can likely be used for all person to person retargeting,
we argue that person to game/VR character retargeting benefits from Simon-Says
expressions that capture the distinct motion signature of the game/VR character
rig. The Simon-Says calibrated rigs tend to produce the desired expressions
when exercising animation controls (as expected). Unfortunately, these
well-calibrated rigs still lead to undesirable controls when tracking a
performance (a well-behaved function can have an arbitrarily ill-conditioned
inverse), even though they typically produce acceptable geometry
reconstructions. Thus, we propose a fine-tuning approach that modifies the rig
used by the tracker in order to promote the output of more semantically
meaningful animation controls, facilitating high efficacy retargeting. In order
to better address real-world scenarios, the fine-tuning relies on implicit
differentiation so that the tracker can be treated as a (potentially
non-differentiable) black box.

### [358] [Hybrid Long and Short Range Flows for Point Cloud Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08542)
*Dasith de Silva Edirimuni,Xuequan Lu,Ajmal Saeed Mian,Lei Wei,Gang Li,Scott Schaefer,Ying He*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合点云滤波方法（HybridPF），结合短程和远程滤波轨迹，通过并行模块（ShortModule和LongModule）分别处理短程分数和远程流，提升去噪效果和推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有滤波方法存在点聚类或噪声残留问题，需要一种更高效的点云去噪方法。

Method: 设计了并行模块ShortModule和LongModule，分别处理短程分数和远程流，并采用动态图卷积解码器优化推理过程。

Result: HybridPF在点云去噪中取得了最先进的结果，同时提高了推理速度。

Conclusion: HybridPF通过结合短程和远程信息，显著提升了点云去噪的效果和效率。

Abstract: Point cloud capture processes are error-prone and introduce noisy artifacts
that necessitate filtering/denoising. Recent filtering methods often suffer
from point clustering or noise retaining issues. In this paper, we propose
Hybrid Point Cloud Filtering ($\textbf{HybridPF}$) that considers both
short-range and long-range filtering trajectories when removing noise. It is
well established that short range scores, given by $\nabla_{x}\log p(x_t)$, may
provide the necessary displacements to move noisy points to the underlying
clean surface. By contrast, long range velocity flows approximate constant
displacements directed from a high noise variant patch $x_0$ towards the
corresponding clean surface $x_1$. Here, noisy patches $x_t$ are viewed as
intermediate states between the high noise variant and the clean patches. Our
intuition is that long range information from velocity flow models can guide
the short range scores to align more closely with the clean points. In turn,
score models generally provide a quicker convergence to the clean surface.
Specifically, we devise two parallel modules, the ShortModule and LongModule,
each consisting of an Encoder-Decoder pair to respectively account for
short-range scores and long-range flows. We find that short-range scores,
guided by long-range features, yield filtered point clouds with good point
distributions and convergence near the clean surface. We design a joint loss
function to simultaneously train the ShortModule and LongModule, in an
end-to-end manner. Finally, we identify a key weakness in current displacement
based methods, limitations on the decoder architecture, and propose a dynamic
graph convolutional decoder to improve the inference process. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that our HybridPF achieves state-of-the-art results
while enabling faster inference speed.

*Xiang Zhang,Yawar Siddiqui,Armen Avetisyan,Chris Xie,Jakob Engel,Henry Howard-Jenkins*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: VertexRegen是一种新型网格生成框架，支持连续细节级别的生成，优于现有自回归方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自回归方法生成网格时中间步骤代表不完整结构，VertexRegen通过逆向边折叠（顶点分裂）解决这一问题。

Method: 受渐进网格启发，将生成过程重新定义为顶点分裂，并通过生成模型学习。

Result: 实验表明，VertexRegen生成的网格质量与最先进方法相当，且支持随时停止生成以得到不同细节级别的有效网格。

Conclusion: VertexRegen在网格生成中实现了连续细节级别和灵活性，具有独特优势。

Abstract: We introduce VertexRegen, a novel mesh generation framework that enables
generation at a continuous level of detail. Existing autoregressive methods
generate meshes in a partial-to-complete manner and thus intermediate steps of
generation represent incomplete structures. VertexRegen takes inspiration from
progressive meshes and reformulates the process as the reversal of edge
collapse, i.e. vertex split, learned through a generative model. Experimental
results demonstrate that VertexRegen produces meshes of comparable quality to
state-of-the-art methods while uniquely offering anytime generation with the
flexibility to halt at any step to yield valid meshes with varying levels of
detail.

TL;DR: ColorCtrl是一种无需训练的颜色编辑方法，利用多模态扩散变换器的注意力机制，实现精确且一致的颜色编辑，并在视频和图像中保持物理一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在颜色编辑中难以实现精确控制和视觉一致性，尤其是在非编辑区域。

Method: 通过解耦结构和颜色，针对性操作注意力图和值标记，实现词级属性强度控制。

Result: 在SD3和FLUX.1-dev上表现优于现有方法，并在编辑质量和一致性上达到最新水平。

Conclusion: ColorCtrl在图像和视频编辑中具有广泛适用性，并在一致性上超越商业模型。

Abstract: Text-guided color editing in images and videos is a fundamental yet unsolved
problem, requiring fine-grained manipulation of color attributes, including
albedo, light source color, and ambient lighting, while preserving physical
consistency in geometry, material properties, and light-matter interactions.
Existing training-free methods offer broad applicability across editing tasks
but struggle with precise color control and often introduce visual
inconsistency in both edited and non-edited regions. In this work, we present
ColorCtrl, a training-free color editing method that leverages the attention
mechanisms of modern Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers (MM-DiT). By
disentangling structure and color through targeted manipulation of attention
maps and value tokens, our method enables accurate and consistent color
editing, along with word-level control of attribute intensity. Our method
modifies only the intended regions specified by the prompt, leaving unrelated
areas untouched. Extensive experiments on both SD3 and FLUX.1-dev demonstrate
that ColorCtrl outperforms existing training-free approaches and achieves
state-of-the-art performances in both edit quality and consistency.
Furthermore, our method surpasses strong commercial models such as FLUX.1
Kontext Max and GPT-4o Image Generation in terms of consistency. When extended
to video models like CogVideoX, our approach exhibits greater advantages,
particularly in maintaining temporal coherence and editing stability. Finally,
our method also generalizes to instruction-based editing diffusion models such
as Step1X-Edit and FLUX.1 Kontext dev, further demonstrating its versatility.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实时全局光照渲染对虚拟环境的真实体验至关重要，但传统方法难以捕捉长距离间接光照。

Method: 采用新型网络架构，结合改进的注意力机制和单色设计，预测间接光照。

Result: 实验表明，该方法优于现有学习技术，能处理复杂光照和未训练场景。

Conclusion: 该方法在全局光照渲染中表现出色，尤其擅长捕捉长距离间接光照和颜色溢出效果。

Abstract: Real-time rendering with global illumination is crucial to afford the user
realistic experience in virtual environments. We present a learning-based
estimator to predict diffuse indirect illumination in screen space, which then
is combined with direct illumination to synthesize globally-illuminated high
dynamic range (HDR) results. Our approach tackles the challenges of capturing
long-range/long-distance indirect illumination when employing neural networks
and is generalized to handle complex lighting and scenarios.
  From the neural network thinking of the solver to the rendering equation, we
present a novel network architecture to predict indirect illumination. Our
network is equipped with a modified attention mechanism that aggregates global
information guided by spacial geometry features, as well as a monochromatic
design that encodes each color channel individually.
  We conducted extensive evaluations, and the experimental results demonstrate
our superiority over previous learning-based techniques. Our approach excels at
handling complex lighting such as varying-colored lighting and environment
lighting. It can successfully capture distant indirect illumination and
simulates the interreflections between textured surfaces well (i.e., color
bleeding effects); it can also effectively handle new scenes that are not
present in the training dataset.

TL;DR: SpectraLLM是一种新型的大型语言模型，用于多模态光谱联合推理，能够高效解析未知分子结构，显著优于现有单模态方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有结构解析方法依赖先验数据库或已知结构信息，难以处理未知结构，且多模态分析依赖专家知识，成本高。

Method: SpectraLLM将连续和离散光谱模态整合到共享语义空间，学习跨光谱的子结构模式，实现端到端结构解析。

Result: 在六个标准化化学数据集上，SpectraLLM表现优异，单谱和多模态推理均显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SpectraLLM为结构解析提供了高效、鲁棒且通用的解决方案，尤其在多模态推理中表现突出。

Abstract: Structure elucidation is a fundamental technique for understanding the
microscopic composition of matter and is widely applied across various
disciplines in the natural sciences and engineering. However, existing methods
often rely heavily on prior databases or known structural information, making
it difficult to resolve unknown structures. In addition, complex structures
typically require the joint analysis of multiple spectroscopic modalities. This
process heavily depends on expert domain knowledge and is often accompanied by
high costs in terms of both time and instrumentation. To address these
challenges, we propose SpectraLLM, the first large language model designed to
support multi-modal spectroscopic joint reasoning. SpectraLLM is capable of
processing either single or multiple spectroscopic inputs and performing
end-to-end structure elucidation. By integrating continuous and discrete
spectroscopic modalities into a shared semantic space, SpectraLLM learns to
uncover substructural patterns that are consistent and complementary across
spectra, enabling precise molecular structure elucidation. We pretrain and
fine-tune SpectraLLM in the domain of small molecules, and evaluate it on six
standardized, publicly available chemical datasets. The model achieves
state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing approaches
trained on single modalities. Notably, SpectraLLM demonstrates strong
robustness and generalization even for single-spectrum inference, while its
multi-modal reasoning capability further improves the accuracy of structural
prediction.

Result: 提出了一种新型自适应WBAN框架，为6G医疗系统提供了研究方向。

Conclusion: 该框架有望实现下一代移动健康应用的超可靠、安全和自优化WBAN。

Abstract: Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) enable continuous monitoring of
physiological signals for applications ranging from chronic disease management
to emergency response. Recent advances in 6G communications, post-quantum
cryptography, and energy harvesting have the potential to enhance WBAN
performance. However, integrating these technologies into a unified, adaptive
system remains a challenge. This paper surveys some of the most well-known
Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) architectures, routing strategies, and
security mechanisms, identifying key gaps in adaptability, energy efficiency,
and quantum-resistant security. We propose a novel Large Language Model-driven
adaptive WBAN framework in which a Large Language Model acts as a cognitive
control plane, coordinating routing, physical layer selection, micro-energy
harvesting, and post-quantum security in real time. Our review highlights the
limitations of current heuristic-based designs and outlines a research agenda
for resource-constrained, 6G-ready medical systems. This approach aims to
enable ultra-reliable, secure, and self-optimizing WBANs for next-generation
mobile health applications.

Abstract: Mobile augmented reality (MAR) is envisioned as a key immersive application
in 6G, enabling virtual content rendering aligned with the physical environment
through device pose estimation. In this paper, we propose a novel agent-driven
communication service provisioning approach for edge-assisted MAR, aiming to
reduce communication overhead between MAR devices and the edge server while
ensuring the quality of experience (QoE). First, to address the inaccessibility
of MAR application-specific information to the network controller, we establish
a digital agent powered by large language models (LLMs) on behalf of the MAR
service provider, bridging the data and function gap between the MAR service
and network domains. Second, to cope with the user-dependent and dynamic nature
of data traffic patterns for individual devices, we develop a user-level QoE
modeling method that captures the relationship between communication resource
demands and perceived user QoE, enabling personalized, agent-driven
communication resource management. Trace-driven simulation results demonstrate
that the proposed approach outperforms conventional LLM-based QoE-aware service
provisioning methods in both user-level QoE modeling accuracy and communication
resource efficiency.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为DUAL-Health的不确定性感知多模态融合框架，用于动态嘈杂环境中的户外健康监测，显著提升了检测准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统户外健康监测依赖静态多模态深度学习框架，需要大量数据训练且难以捕捉细微健康变化。多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）虽具潜力，但面临噪声干扰、多模态融合不鲁棒及数据恢复困难等挑战。

Method: 1. 量化由输入和波动噪声引起的模态不确定性；2. 基于不确定性定制融合权重；3. 在共同语义空间中对齐模态分布以增强数据恢复。

Result: 实验表明DUAL-Health在检测准确性和鲁棒性上优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: DUAL-Health通过不确定性感知的多模态融合，有效解决了动态嘈杂环境中的户外健康监测问题。

Abstract: Outdoor health monitoring is essential to detect early abnormal health status
for safeguarding human health and safety. Conventional outdoor monitoring
relies on static multimodal deep learning frameworks, which requires extensive
data training from scratch and fails to capture subtle health status changes.
Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) emerge as a promising alternative,
utilizing only small datasets to fine-tune pre-trained information-rich models
for enabling powerful health status monitoring. Unfortunately, MLLM-based
outdoor health monitoring also faces significant challenges: I) sensor data
contains input noise stemming from sensor data acquisition and fluctuation
noise caused by sudden changes in physiological signals due to dynamic outdoor
environments, thus degrading the training performance; ii) current transformer
based MLLMs struggle to achieve robust multimodal fusion, as they lack a design
for fusing the noisy modality; iii) modalities with varying noise levels hinder
accurate recovery of missing data from fluctuating distributions. To combat
these challenges, we propose an uncertainty-aware multimodal fusion framework,
named DUAL-Health, for outdoor health monitoring in dynamic and noisy
environments. First, to assess the impact of noise, we accurately quantify
modality uncertainty caused by input and fluctuation noise with current and
temporal features. Second, to empower efficient muitimodal fusion with
low-quality modalities,we customize the fusion weight for each modality based
on quantified and calibrated uncertainty. Third, to enhance data recovery from
fluctuating noisy modalities, we align modality distributions within a common
semantic space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our DUAL-Health
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in detection accuracy and robustness.

To address these challenges, a novel multi-modal RAG model,\nnamed MMRAG-DocQA, was proposed, leveraging both textual and visual information\nacross long-range pages to facilitate accurate question answering.

We also propose a lightweight, explainable\nspatio-temporal Graph Convolutional Network architecture with temporal\nattention pooling, that uses only facial landmarks to model dynamic facial\ngestures. Experimental results demonstrate that facial motion cues enable\nmeaningful identity verification with AUC values approaching 80%. The proposed\nbenchmark and biometric system are available for the research community in\norder to bring attention to the urgent need for more advanced behavioral\nbiometric defenses in avatar-based communication systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5728\u903c\u771f\u5934\u50cf\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9762\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u884c\u4e3a\u751f\u7269\u7279\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u8eab\u4efd\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u56fe\u5377\u79ef\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u903c\u771f\u5934\u50cf\u5728\u865a\u62df\u4f1a\u8bae\u548c\u793e\u4ea4\u5e73\u53f0\u4e2d\u7684\u666e\u53ca\uff0c\u5176\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\uff08\u5982\u5192\u5145\uff09\u65e5\u76ca\u7a81\u51fa\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528GAGAvatar\u751f\u6210\u771f\u5b9e\u548c\u5192\u5145\u5934\u50cf\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u9762\u90e8\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u56fe\u5377\u79ef\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6c60\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u9762\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\u7279\u5f81\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cAUC\u503c\u63a5\u8fd180%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5728\u5934\u50cf\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u5148\u8fdb\u884c\u4e3a\u751f\u7269\u7279\u5f81\u9632\u5fa1\u7684\u7d27\u8feb\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u516c\u5f00\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

In contrast, we humans can not only naturally identify the\nsemantic categories of sounding sources but also determine their deeply encoded\nspatial attributes, including locations and movement directions. This useful\ninformation can be elucidated by considering specific spatial indicators\nderived from the inherent physical properties of sound, such as loudness or\nfrequency.

Therefore, multiple LLMs are usually\ndeployed at the network edge to boost real-time responsiveness and protect data\nprivacy, particularly for many emerging smart mobile and IoT applications.\nGiven the varying response quality and latency of LLM services, a critical\nissue is how to route user requests from mobile and IoT devices to an\nappropriate LLM service (i.e., edge LLM expert) to ensure acceptable\nquality-of-service (QoS). Existing routing algorithms fail to simultaneously\naddress the heterogeneity of LLM services, the interference among requests, and\nthe dynamic workloads necessary for maintaining long-term stable QoS. To meet\nthese challenges, in this paper we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning\n(DRL)-based QoS-aware LLM routing framework for sustained high-quality LLM\nservices. Due to the dynamic nature of the global state, we propose a dynamic\nstate abstraction technique to compactly represent global state features with a\nheterogeneous graph attention network (HAN). Additionally, we introduce an\naction impact estimator and a tailored reward function to guide the DRL agent\nin maximizing QoS and preventing latency violations.

Topographic constraints in\nneural networks can be implemented in multiple ways, with potentially different\nimpacts on the representations learned by the network. The impact of such\ndifferent implementations has not been systematically examined. To this end,\nhere we compare topographic convolutional neural networks trained with two\nspatial constraints: Weight Similarity (WS), which pushes neighboring units to\ndevelop similar incoming weights, and Activation Similarity (AS), which\nenforces similarity in unit activations. We evaluate the resulting models on\nclassification accuracy, robustness to weight perturbations and input\ndegradation, and the spatial organization of learned representations. Compared\nto both AS and standard CNNs, WS provided three main advantages: i) improved\nrobustness to noise, also showing higher accuracy under weight corruption; ii)\ngreater input sensitivity, reflected in higher activation variance; and iii)\nstronger functional localization, with units showing similar activations\npositioned at closer distances.

In this paper, we propose GeoExplorer, an AGL\nagent that incorporates curiosity-driven exploration through intrinsic rewards.\nUnlike distance-based rewards, our curiosity-driven reward is goal-agnostic,\nenabling robust, diverse, and contextually relevant exploration based on\neffective environment modeling. These capabilities have been proven through\nextensive experiments across four AGL benchmarks, demonstrating the\neffectiveness and generalization ability of GeoExplorer in diverse settings,\nparticularly in localizing unfamiliar targets and environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "GeoExplorer\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u597d\u5947\u5fc3\u9a71\u52a8\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u5730\u7406\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5185\u5728\u5956\u52b1\u63d0\u5347\u5728\u672a\u77e5\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ddd\u79bb\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8ddd\u79bb\u4f30\u8ba1\u56f0\u96be\u6216\u9762\u5bf9\u672a\u77e5\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u73af\u5883\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGeoExplorer\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u597d\u5947\u5fc3\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5185\u5728\u5956\u52b1\u8fdb\u884c\u76ee\u6807\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u73af\u5883\u5efa\u6a21\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6837\u5316\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2aAGL\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86GeoExplorer\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5b9a\u4f4d\u964c\u751f\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "\u597d\u5947\u5fc3\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86AGL\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u6837\u5316\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

To improve an algorithm's ability to\nmitigate partial observability, researchers need comprehensive benchmarks to\ngauge progress. Most algorithms tackling partial observability are only\nevaluated on benchmarks with simple forms of state aliasing, such as feature\nmasking and Gaussian noise. Such benchmarks do not represent the many forms of\npartial observability seen in real domains, like visual occlusion or unknown\nopponent intent. We argue that a partially observable benchmark should have two\nkey properties. The first is coverage in its forms of partial observability, to\nensure an algorithm's generalizability. The second is a large gap between the\nperformance of a agents with more or less state information, all other factors\nroughly equal. This gap implies that an environment is memory improvable: where\nperformance gains in a domain are from an algorithm's ability to cope with\npartial observability as opposed to other factors. We introduce best-practice\nguidelines for empirically benchmarking reinforcement learning under partial\nobservability, as well as the open-source library POBAX: Partially Observable\nBenchmarks in JAX. We characterize the types of partial observability present\nin various environments and select representative environments for our\nbenchmark. These environments include localization and mapping, visual control,\ngames, and more. Additionally, we show that these tasks are all memory\nimprovable and require hard-to-learn memory functions, providing a concrete\nsignal for partial observability research.

They are often biased,\nunreliable, and unfit to define \"ground truth.\" Yet, given the surging need to\nproduce large amounts of training data in educational applications using AI,\ntraditional inter-rater reliability (IRR) metrics like Cohen's kappa remain\ncentral to validating labeled data. IRR remains a cornerstone of many machine\nlearning pipelines for educational data. Take, for example, the classification\nof tutors' moves in dialogues or labeling open responses in machine-graded\nassessments. This position paper argues that overreliance on human IRR as a\ngatekeeper for annotation quality hampers progress in classifying data in ways\nthat are valid and predictive in relation to improving learning. To address\nthis issue, we highlight five examples of complementary evaluation methods,\nsuch as multi-label annotation schemes, expert-based approaches, and\nclose-the-loop validity.

With the increasing proliferation of the Internet of\nThings (IoT) and smart manufacturing, time-series data has dramatically\nincreased in both scale and dimensionality. This growth has exposed the\nlimitations of traditional statistical methods in handling the high\nheterogeneity and complexity of such data. Inspired by the recent success of\nlarge language models (LLMs) in multimodal tasks across language and vision\ndomains, we propose a novel unsupervised anomaly detection framework: A\nTri-Branch Patch-wise Large Language Model Framework for Time-Series Anomaly\nDetection (TriP-LLM). TriP-LLM integrates local and global temporal features\nthrough a tri-branch design-Patching, Selection, and Global-to encode the input\ntime series into patch-wise tokens, which are then processed by a frozen,\npretrained LLM. A lightweight patch-wise decoder reconstructs the input, from\nwhich anomaly scores are derived. We evaluate TriP-LLM on several public\nbenchmark datasets using PATE, a recently proposed threshold-free evaluation\nmetric, and conduct all comparisons within a unified open-source framework to\nensure fairness. Experimental results show that TriP-LLM consistently\noutperforms recent state-of-the-art methods across all datasets, demonstrating\nstrong detection capabilities. Furthermore, through extensive ablation studies,\nwe verify the substantial contribution of the LLM to the overall architecture.\nCompared to LLM-based approaches using Channel Independence (CI) patch\nprocessing, TriP-LLM achieves significantly lower memory consumption, making it\nmore suitable for GPU memory-constrained environments.

Existing methods are either ill-suited to precisely control\nhigh-dimensional upper-body joints, or difficult to ensure both robustness and\naccuracy, especially when upper-body motions are fast. This paper proposes a\nnovel time optimization policy (TOP), to train a standing manipulation control\nmodel that ensures balance, precision, and time efficiency simultaneously, with\nthe idea of adjusting the time trajectory of upper-body motions but not only\nstrengthening the disturbance resistance of the lower-body. Our approach\nconsists of three parts. Firstly, we utilize motion prior to represent\nupper-body motions to enhance the coordination ability between the upper and\nlower-body by training a variational autoencoder (VAE). Then we decouple the\nwhole-body control into an upper-body PD controller for precision and a\nlower-body RL controller to enhance robust stability. Finally, we train TOP\nmethod in conjunction with the decoupled controller and VAE to reduce the\nbalance burden resulting from fast upper-body motions that would destabilize\nthe robot and exceed the capabilities of the lower-body RL policy. The\neffectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated via both simulation and\nreal world experiments, which demonstrate the superiority on standing\nmanipulation tasks stably and accurately.

These changes are widely attributed\nto the growing influence of Large Language Models (LLMs), which frequently rely\non a distinct lexical style. Divergences between model output and target\naudience norms can be viewed as a form of misalignment. While these shifts are\noften linked to using Artificial Intelligence (AI) directly as a tool to\ngenerate text, it remains unclear whether the changes reflect broader changes\nin the human language system itself. To explore this question, we constructed a\ndataset of 22.1 million words from unscripted spoken language drawn from\nconversational science and technology podcasts. We analyzed lexical trends\nbefore and after ChatGPT's release in 2022, focusing on commonly LLM-associated\nwords. Our results show a moderate yet significant increase in the usage of\nthese words post-2022, suggesting a convergence between human word choices and\nLLM-associated patterns. In contrast, baseline synonym words exhibit no\nsignificant directional shift. Given the short time frame and the number of\nwords affected, this may indicate the onset of a remarkable shift in language\nuse. Whether this represents natural language change or a novel shift driven by\nAI exposure remains an open question. Similarly, although the shifts may stem\nfrom broader adoption patterns, it may also be that upstream training\nmisalignments ultimately contribute to changes in human language use. These\nfindings parallel ethical concerns that misaligned models may shape social and\nmoral beliefs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c2022\u5e74\u540e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u4e0e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u8bcd\u6c47\u4f7f\u7528\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bed\u8a00\u9009\u62e9\u4e0eLLM\u6a21\u5f0f\u8d8b\u540c\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u662f\u5426\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bed\u8a00\u7cfb\u7edf\u672c\u8eab\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b2210\u4e07\u5355\u8bcd\u7684\u975e\u811a\u672c\u53e3\u8bed\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5206\u6790ChatGPT\u53d1\u5e03\u524d\u540e\u4e0eLLM\u76f8\u5173\u8bcd\u6c47\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u8d8b\u52bf\u3002", "result": "2022\u5e74\u540e\uff0c\u4e0eLLM\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u8bcd\u6c47\u4f7f\u7528\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u800c\u57fa\u7ebf\u540c\u4e49\u8bcd\u672a\u663e\u793a\u663e\u8457\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u6807\u5fd7\u7740\u8bed\u8a00\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u663e\u8457\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u53d8\u5316\u662f\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6f14\u53d8\u8fd8\u662fAI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5f15\u53d1\u4f26\u7406\u62c5\u5fe7\u3002"}}

In order to address these\ndrawbacks, we introduced StackLiverNet in this study; an interpretable stacked\nensemble model tailored to the liver disease detection task. The framework uses\nadvanced data preprocessing and feature selection technique to increase model\nrobustness and predictive ability. Random undersampling is performed to deal\nwith class imbalance and make the training balanced. StackLiverNet is an\nensemble of several hyperparameter-optimized base classifiers, whose\ncomplementary advantages are used through a LightGBM meta-model. The provided\nmodel demonstrates excellent performance, with the testing accuracy of 99.89%,\nCohen Kappa of 0.9974, and AUC of 0.9993, having only 5 misclassifications, and\nefficient training and inference speeds that are amenable to clinical practice\n(training time 4.2783 seconds, inference time 0.1106 seconds). Besides, Local\nInterpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) are applied to generate\ntransparent explanations of individual predictions, revealing high\nconcentrations of Alkaline Phosphatase and moderate SGOT as important\nobservations of liver disease. Also, SHAP was used to rank features by their\nglobal contribution to predictions, while the Morris method confirmed the most\ninfluential features through sensitivity analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faStackLiverNet\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5806\u53e0\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u809d\u75c5\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u8bef\u5206\u7c7b\u7387\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u809d\u75c5\u8bca\u65ad\u9700\u7cbe\u786e\u53ca\u65f6\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u8bef\u5206\u7c7b\u7387\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u9ad8\u7ea7\u6570\u636e\u9884\u5904\u7406\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u968f\u673a\u6b20\u91c7\u6837\u5904\u7406\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u5806\u53e0\u591a\u4e2a\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u57fa\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7LightGBM\u5143\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u6d4b\u8bd5\u51c6\u786e\u738799.89%\uff0cCohen Kappa 0.9974\uff0cAUC 0.9993\uff0c\u4ec55\u6b21\u8bef\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u5feb\u3002", "conclusion": "StackLiverNet\u5728\u809d\u75c5\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

However, their diagnostic\nreliability in complex clinical scenarios remains limited. This study aims to\nenhance LLMs' diagnostic accuracy and clinical reasoning ability. Method: We\npropose an Etiology-Aware Attention Steering Framework to integrate structured\nclinical reasoning into LLM-based diagnosis. Specifically, we first construct\nClinical Reasoning Scaffolding (CRS) based on authoritative clinical guidelines\nfor three representative acute abdominal emergencies: acute appendicitis, acute\npancreatitis, and acute cholecystitis. Next, we develop the Etiology-Aware Head\nIdentification algorithm to pinpoint attention heads crucial for the model's\netiology reasoning. To ensure reliable clinical reasoning alignment, we\nintroduce the Reasoning-Guided Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning that embeds\netiological reasoning cues into input representations and steers the selected\nEtiology-Aware Heads toward critical information through a Reasoning-Guided\nLoss function. Result: On the Consistent Diagnosis Cohort, our framework\nimproves average diagnostic accuracy by 15.65% and boosts the average Reasoning\nFocus Score by 31.6% over baselines. External validation on the Discrepant\nDiagnosis Cohort further confirms its effectiveness in enhancing diagnostic\naccuracy. Further assessments via Reasoning Attention Frequency indicate that\nour models exhibit enhanced reliability when faced with real-world complex\nscenarios.

Traditional convolutional neural network has limitations in\ndealing with long-range dependencies and are unable to fully model the global\ncontextual information in depth maps. Although transformer can model global\ndependencies, its computational complexity and memory consumption are\nquadratic, which significantly limits its ability to process high-resolution\ndepth maps. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale fusion U-shaped Mamba\n(MSF-UM) model, a novel guided depth map super-resolution framework. The core\ninnovation of this model is to integrate Mamba's efficient state-space modeling\ncapabilities into a multi-scale U-shaped fusion structure guided by a color\nimage. The structure combining the residual dense channel attention block and\nthe Mamba state space module is designed, which combines the local feature\nextraction capability of the convolutional layer with the modeling advantage of\nthe state space model for long-distance dependencies.

In this article, we address the\nstate-of-the-art of the discipline, focusing on recent models and benchmarks,\nand explore three central issues at the intersection of machine learning and\nmathematical cognition: (i) the trade-offs between formal and informal\nmathematics as training domains; (ii) the deeper reasons why proof generation\nremains more brittle than code synthesis; (iii) and the question of whether\nLLMs represent, or merely mimic, a notion of evolving logical state.

Using data from\none million students, the system learns which assistance action (e.g., one of\nmultiple hints) to provide for each question to optimize student learning.\nEmploying the multi-armed bandit (MAB) framework and offline policy evaluation,\nwe assess 43,000 assistance actions, and identify trade-offs between assistance\npolicies optimized for different student outcomes (e.g., response correctness,\nsession completion). We design an algorithm that for each question decides on a\nsuitable policy training objective to enhance students' immediate second\nattempt success and overall practice session performance. We evaluate the\nresulting MAB policies in 166,000 practice sessions, verifying significant\nimprovements in student outcomes. While MAB policies optimize feedback for the\noverall student population, we further investigate whether contextual bandit\n(CB) policies can enhance outcomes by personalizing feedback based on\nindividual student features (e.g., ability estimates, response times). Using\ncausal inference, we examine (i) how effects of assistance actions vary across\nstudents and (ii) whether CB policies, which leverage such effect\nheterogeneity, outperform MAB policies.

The results show high accuracy of the surrogate models\n(e.g., R2> 90%) across a diverse set of building types, geometries, seismic\ndesign, and site hazard, where the optimization algorithm could identify the\noptimum values of members' properties for a fixed set of geometric variables,\nconsistent with engineering principles.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6297\u9707\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9006\u5411\u5de5\u7a0b\u76f4\u63a5\u6620\u5c04\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53d8\u91cf\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53c2\u6570\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5730\u9707\u635f\u5931\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u6297\u9707\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u76f4\u63a5\u5173\u8054\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53d8\u91cf\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9057\u4f20\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u6c42\u89e3\u9006\u5411\u5de5\u7a0b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u5efa\u7b51\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u5730\u9707\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff08R2>90%\uff09\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u8bc6\u522b\u7b26\u5408\u5de5\u7a0b\u539f\u5219\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u5efa\u7b51\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u5730\u9707\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u4e3a\u6027\u80fd\u6297\u9707\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Sharpness-Aware\nMinimization (SAM) improves model generalization for both Convolutional Neural\nNetworks (CNNs) and Transformers by encouraging convergence to locally flat\nminima. However, the connection between sharpness and generalization has not\nbeen fully explored for LoRA due to the lack of tools to either empirically\nseek flat minima or develop theoretical methods. In this work, we propose\nFlat-LoRA and its efficient version i.e., EFlat-LoRA, to seek flat minima for\nLoRA. Concretely, we theoretically demonstrate that perturbations in the full\nparameter space can be transferred to the low-rank subspace. This approach\neliminates the potential interference introduced by perturbations across\nmultiple matrices in the low-rank subspace. Our extensive experiments on large\nlanguage models and vision-language models demonstrate that EFlat-LoRA achieves\noptimize efficiency comparable to that of LoRA while simultaneously attaining\ncomparable or even better performance. For example, on the GLUE dataset with\nRoBERTa-large, EFlat-LoRA outperforms LoRA and full fine-tuning by 1.0% and\n0.5% on average, respectively. On vision-language models e.g., Qwen-VL-Chat\nshows performance improvements of 1.5% and 1.0% on SQA and VizWiz datasets,\nrespectively.

Building on this observation, we\ndemonstrate that linear classifiers trained on these features can achieve\nstate-of-the-art results across various modalities, while remaining\ncomputationally efficient, fast to train, and effective even in few-shot\nsettings.

Project page:\n  https://gwxuan.github.io/IGL-Nav/", "summary": "Visual navigation with an image as goal is a fundamental and challenging\nproblem. Conventional methods either rely on end-to-end RL learning or\nmodular-based policy with topological graph or BEV map as memory, which cannot\nfully model the geometric relationship between the explored 3D environment and\nthe goal image. In order to efficiently and accurately localize the goal image\nin 3D space, we build our navigation system upon the renderable 3D gaussian\n(3DGS) representation. However, due to the computational intensity of 3DGS\noptimization and the large search space of 6-DoF camera pose, directly\nleveraging 3DGS for image localization during agent exploration process is\nprohibitively inefficient. To this end, we propose IGL-Nav, an Incremental 3D\nGaussian Localization framework for efficient and 3D-aware image-goal\nnavigation. Specifically, we incrementally update the scene representation as\nnew images arrive with feed-forward monocular prediction. Then we coarsely\nlocalize the goal by leveraging the geometric information for discrete space\nmatching, which can be equivalent to efficient 3D convolution. When the agent\nis close to the goal, we finally solve the fine target pose with optimization\nvia differentiable rendering. The proposed IGL-Nav outperforms existing\nstate-of-the-art methods by a large margin across diverse experimental\nconfigurations. It can also handle the more challenging free-view image-goal\nsetting and be deployed on real-world robotic platform using a cellphone to\ncapture goal image at arbitrary pose.

Under the setting of online convex optimization, several\nalgorithms have been successfully developed to minimize the adaptive regret.\nHowever, existing algorithms lack universality in the sense that they can only\nhandle one type of convex functions and need apriori knowledge of parameters,\nwhich hinders their application in real-world scenarios. To address this\nlimitation, this paper investigates universal algorithms with dual adaptivity,\nwhich automatically adapt to the property of functions (convex, exponentially\nconcave, or strongly convex), as well as the nature of environments (stationary\nor changing). Specifically, we propose a meta-expert framework for dual\nadaptive algorithms, where multiple experts are created dynamically and\naggregated by a meta-algorithm. The meta-algorithm is required to yield a\nsecond-order bound, which can accommodate unknown function types.

Yet, increasing task complexity has led to larger models and more\ntokens, raising the quadratic cost of self-attention and the overhead of GPU\nmemory access.

Meanwhile, fused attention kernels such as FlashAttention have been\ndeveloped to alleviate memory overhead by avoiding attention map construction\nand its associated I/O to HBM. This, however, makes it incompatible with most\ntraining-free token compression methods, which rely on attention maps to\ndetermine token importance.

But, similarly to other forms,\ntabular data suffers from class imbalance, a problem that causes serious\nperformance degradation in a wide variety of machine learning tasks. One of the\nmost effective solutions dictates the usage of Generative Adversarial Networks\n(GANs) in order to synthesize artificial data instances for the\nunder-represented classes. Despite their good performance, none of the proposed\nGAN models takes into account the vector subspaces of the input samples in the\nreal data space, leading to data generation in arbitrary locations. Moreover,\nthe class labels are treated in the same manner as the other categorical\nvariables during training, so conditional sampling by class is rendered less\neffective. To overcome these problems, this study presents ctdGAN, a\nconditional GAN for alleviating class imbalance in tabular datasets. Initially,\nctdGAN executes a space partitioning step to assign cluster labels to the input\nsamples. Subsequently, it utilizes these labels to synthesize samples via a\nnovel probabilistic sampling strategy and a new loss function that penalizes\nboth cluster and class mis-predictions. In this way, ctdGAN is trained to\ngenerate samples in subspaces that resemble those of the original data\ndistribution. We also introduce several other improvements, including a simple,\nyet effective cluster-wise scaling technique that captures multiple feature\nmodes without affecting data dimensionality.

Faced with real-world\ngraphs that often carry node descriptions in the form of raw text sequences,\ntermed text-attributed graphs (TAGs), existing graph anomaly detection\npipelines typically involve shallow embedding techniques to encode such textual\ninformation into features, and then rely on complex self-supervised tasks\nwithin the graph domain to detect anomalies. However, this text encoding\nprocess is separated from the anomaly detection training objective in the graph\ndomain, making it difficult to ensure that the extracted textual features focus\non GAD-relevant information, seriously constraining the detection capability.\nHow to seamlessly integrate raw text and graph topology to unleash the vast\npotential of cross-modal data in TAGs for anomaly detection poses a challenging\nissue. This paper presents a novel end-to-end paradigm for text-attributed\ngraph anomaly detection, named CMUCL.

This paper delves into a previously\noverlooked information asymmetry issue in PT, where the visual modality mostly\nconveys more context than the object-oriented textual modality.\nCorrespondingly, coarsely aligning these two modalities could result in the\nbiased attention, driving the model to merely focus on the context area. To\naddress this, we propose DAPT, an effective PT framework based on an intuitive\ndecouple-before-align concept. First, we propose to explicitly decouple the\nvisual modality into the foreground and background representation via\nexploiting coarse-and-fine visual segmenting cues, and then both of these\ndecoupled patterns are aligned with the original foreground texts and the\nhand-crafted background classes, thereby symmetrically strengthening the modal\nalignment. To further enhance the visual concentration, we propose a visual\npull-push regularization tailored for the foreground-background patterns,\ndirecting the original visual representation towards unbiased attention on the\nregion-of-interest object.

However,\ntraditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems for radiology question\nanswering (QA) typically rely on single-step retrieval, limiting their ability\nto handle complex clinical reasoning tasks. Here we propose an agentic RAG\nframework enabling LLMs to autonomously decompose radiology questions,\niteratively retrieve targeted clinical evidence from Radiopaedia, and\ndynamically synthesize evidence-based responses. We evaluated 24 LLMs spanning\ndiverse architectures, parameter scales (0.5B to >670B), and training paradigms\n(general-purpose, reasoning-optimized, clinically fine-tuned), using 104\nexpert-curated radiology questions from previously established RSNA-RadioQA and\nExtendedQA datasets. Agentic retrieval significantly improved mean diagnostic\naccuracy over zero-shot prompting (73% vs. 64%; P<0.001) and conventional\nonline RAG (73% vs. 68%; P<0.001). The greatest gains occurred in mid-sized\nmodels (e.g., Mistral Large improved from 72% to 81%) and small-scale models\n(e.g., Qwen 2.5-7B improved from 55% to 71%), while very large models (>200B\nparameters) demonstrated minimal changes (<2% improvement).

Increasing the autoencoder's latent channel\nnumber is a highly effective approach for improving its reconstruction quality.\nHowever, it results in slow convergence for diffusion models, leading to poorer\ngeneration quality despite better reconstruction quality. This issue limits the\nquality upper bound of latent diffusion models and hinders the employment of\nautoencoders with higher spatial compression ratios. We introduce two key\ninnovations to address this challenge: i) Structured Latent Space, a\ntraining-based approach to impose a desired channel-wise structure on the\nlatent space with front latent channels capturing object structures and latter\nlatent channels capturing image details; ii) Augmented Diffusion Training, an\naugmented diffusion training strategy with additional diffusion training\nobjectives on object latent channels to accelerate convergence.

Our extensive experiments on discriminator designs reveal that a\ncritical component missing in the outpainting fine-tuning process is a\ndiscriminator capable of effectively assessing the perceptual quality of the\nextended areas. To tackle this limitation, we differentiate the objectives of\nadversarial training into global and local goals and introduce a hierarchical\ndiscriminator that meets both objectives. Additionally, we develop a\nspecialized outpainting loss function that leverages both local and global\nfeatures of the discriminator. Fine-tuning on this adversarial loss function\nenhances the generator's ability to produce both visually appealing and\nglobally coherent outpainted scenes.

Mamba, as an emerging state space model with\ninherently linear complexity and global receptive fields, is highly suitable\nfor processing image segmentation tasks with long sequence features. However,\ndue to the particularity of underwater scenes, there are many challenges in\napplying Mamba to UIS. The existing fixed-patch scanning mechanism cannot\nmaintain the internal continuity of scanned instances in the presence of\nseverely underwater color distortion and blurred instance boundaries, and the\nhidden state of the complex underwater background can also inhibit the\nunderstanding of instance objects. In this work, we propose the first\nMamba-based underwater instance segmentation model UIS-Mamba, and design two\ninnovative modules, Dynamic Tree Scan (DTS) and Hidden State Weaken (HSW), to\nmigrate Mamba to the underwater task. DTS module maintains the continuity of\nthe internal features of the instance objects by allowing the patches to\ndynamically offset and scale, thereby guiding the minimum spanning tree and\nproviding dynamic local receptive fields. HSW module suppresses the\ninterference of complex backgrounds and effectively focuses the information\nflow of state propagation to the instances themselves through the Ncut-based\nhidden state weakening mechanism.

Existing\nmethods, such as those that use pre-trained diffusion models, often struggle to\ngenerate plausible completions in dynamic scenarios because they have a limited\nunderstanding of HOI. To solve this problem, we've developed a new approach\nthat uses physical prior knowledge along with a specialized multi-regional\ninpainting technique designed for HOI. By incorporating physical constraints\nfrom human topology and contact information, we define two distinct regions:\nthe primary region, where occluded object parts are most likely to be, and the\nsecondary region, where occlusions are less probable. Our multi-regional\ninpainting method uses customized denoising strategies across these regions\nwithin a diffusion model.

TrajSurv employs a neural controlled differential equation\n(NCDE) to extract continuous-time latent states from the irregularly sampled\ndata, forming continuous latent trajectories. To ensure the latent trajectories\nreflect the clinical progression, TrajSurv aligns the latent state space with\npatient state space through a time-aware contrastive learning approach. To\ntransparently link clinical progression to the survival outcome, TrajSurv uses\nlatent trajectories in a two-step divide-and-conquer interpretation process.\nFirst, it explains how the changes in clinical features translate into the\nlatent trajectory's evolution using a learned vector field. Second, it clusters\nthese latent trajectories to identify key clinical progression patterns\nassociated with different survival outcomes. Evaluations on two real-world\nmedical datasets, MIMIC-III and eICU, show TrajSurv's competitive accuracy and\nsuperior transparency over existing deep learning methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "TrajSurv\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5229\u7528\u7eb5\u5411\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\uff08EHR\uff09\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u4fe1\u751f\u5b58\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u795e\u7ecf\u63a7\u5236\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\uff08NCDE\uff09\u63d0\u53d6\u8fde\u7eed\u6f5c\u5728\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u89e3\u91ca\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u900f\u660e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u7eb5\u5411EHR\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u91c7\u6837\u7279\u5f81\u5efa\u6a21\u56f0\u96be\u53ca\u4e34\u5e8a\u8fdb\u5c55\u4e0e\u751f\u5b58\u7ed3\u679c\u900f\u660e\u5173\u8054\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528NCDE\u63d0\u53d6\u8fde\u7eed\u6f5c\u5728\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u9f50\u6f5c\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u89e3\u91ca\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08\u5411\u91cf\u573a\u548c\u805a\u7c7b\uff09\u900f\u660e\u5173\u8054\u4e34\u5e8a\u8fdb\u5c55\u4e0e\u751f\u5b58\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5728MIMIC-III\u548ceICU\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cTrajSurv\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u900f\u660e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "TrajSurv\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u900f\u660e\u7684\u751f\u5b58\u9884\u6d4b\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Recently, generalist graph anomaly detection (GAD) models have shown\npromising results. They are pretrained on multiple source datasets and\ngeneralize across domains. While effective on static graphs, they struggle to\ncapture evolving anomalies in dynamic graphs. Moreover, the continuous\nemergence of new domains and the lack of labeled data further challenge\ngeneralist DGAD. Effective cross-domain DGAD requires both domain-specific and\ndomain-agnostic anomalous patterns. Importantly, these patterns evolve\ntemporally within and across domains. Building on these insights, we propose a\nDGAD model with Dynamic Prototypes (DP) to capture evolving domain-specific and\ndomain-agnostic patterns. Firstly, DP-DGAD extracts dynamic prototypes, i.e.,\nevolving representations of normal and anomalous patterns, from temporal\nego-graphs and stores them in a memory buffer. The buffer is selectively\nupdated to retain general, domain-agnostic patterns while incorporating new\ndomain-specific ones. Then, an anomaly scorer compares incoming data with\ndynamic prototypes to flag both general and domain-specific anomalies.

Numerical tests on the combination of GDFM and GAN have demonstrated\nperformance improvements over competing alternatives in synthesizing wind power\nscenarios from Australia, better realizing plausible statistical\ncharacteristics of actual wind power compared to alternatives such as the GDFM\nwith a filter synthesized from distributions of actual dynamic filters and the\nGAN with direct synthesis without dynamic factors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7ed3\u5408GDFM\u548cGAN\u751f\u6210\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u98ce\u7535\u573a\u7684\u957f\u671f\u98ce\u7535\u529f\u7387\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u7a7a\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u56e0\u5b50\u63d0\u53d6\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u72ec\u4f7f\u7528GDFM\u6216GAN\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u8d44\u6e90\u5145\u8db3\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u9700\u8981\u751f\u6210\u591a\u98ce\u7535\u573a\u957f\u671f\u98ce\u7535\u529f\u7387\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982GDFM\u6216GAN\uff09\u5728\u65f6\u7a7a\u7279\u5f81\u6a21\u62df\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408GDFM\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548cGAN\u7684\u6ce2\u5f62\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u52a8\u6001\u56e0\u5b50\u63d0\u53d6\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\uff0c\u7efc\u5408\u65f6\u7a7a\u548c\u9891\u7387\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6fb3\u5927\u5229\u4e9a\u98ce\u7535\u6570\u636e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cGDFM-GAN\u7ec4\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u6027\u548c\u6ce2\u5f62\u6a21\u62df\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u72ec\u4f7f\u7528GDFM\u6216GAN\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "GDFM-GAN\u7ec4\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u6a21\u62df\u5b9e\u9645\u98ce\u7535\u529f\u7387\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u5145\u8db3\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

However, due to the inherent trade-off\nbetween spectral and spatial information and the limited availability of\nobservations, this task is fundamentally ill-posed. Previous studies have not\neffectively addressed the ill-posed nature caused by data misalignment. To\ntackle this challenge, we propose a fusion framework named PIF-Net, which\nexplicitly incorporates ill-posed priors to effectively fuse multispectral\nimages and hyperspectral images.

We present LAMIC, a Layout-Aware Multi-Image Composition framework\nthat, for the first time, extends single-reference diffusion models to\nmulti-reference scenarios in a training-free manner. Built upon the MMDiT\nmodel, LAMIC introduces two plug-and-play attention mechanisms: 1) Group\nIsolation Attention (GIA) to enhance entity disentanglement; and 2)\nRegion-Modulated Attention (RMA) to enable layout-aware generation. To\ncomprehensively evaluate model capabilities, we further introduce three\nmetrics: 1) Inclusion Ratio (IN-R) and Fill Ratio (FI-R) for assessing layout\ncontrol; and 2) Background Similarity (BG-S) for measuring background\nconsistency. Extensive experiments show that LAMIC achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance across most major metrics: it consistently outperforms existing\nmulti-reference baselines in ID-S, BG-S, IN-R and AVG scores across all\nsettings, and achieves the best DPG in complex composition tasks.

To address this challenge, we propose Nested Graph Pseudo-Label\nRefinement (NeGPR), a novel framework tailored for graph-level domain\nadaptation with noisy labels.

To effectively evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in this domain, it\nis crucial to have a well-designed benchmark that accurately reflects\nreal-world scenarios and mitigates common pitfalls. Existing LLM test\ngeneration benchmarks are limited by two critical drawbacks: data contamination\nand structurally simple function code. As a result, we often cannot rely on the\nvalidity of scientific conclusions drawn from empirical studies using these\nlimited benchmarks. The empirical evidence presented may be biased due to\ncontamination and may fail to generalize beyond toy programs due to structural\nsimplicity.\n  To address these problems, we introduce ULT (UnLeakedTestbench), a new\nbenchmark specifically designed for function-level unit test generation from\nreal-world Python functions. ULT is constructed through a multi-stage curation\nprocess that ensures high cyclomatic complexity and mitigates test case\ncontamination. With 3,909 carefully selected function-level tasks, ULT provides\na more realistic and challenging evaluation of LLMs' test generation\ncapabilities. We also provide PLT (PreLeakedTestbench), a pair benchmark of ULT\nwith leaked tests designed to enable a controlled analysis of memorization\nversus reasoning in test generation. Our evaluation results demonstrate that\nULT is significantly more challenging. For example, test cases generated by\nLLMs only achieve 41.32\\%, 45.10\\%, 30.22\\%, and 40.21\\% for accuracy,\nstatement coverage, branch coverage, and mutation score on average for all\nLLMs, respectively.

While recent deep learning methods have advanced lesion segmentation,\nthey primarily target large lesions and neglect valuable longitudinal and\nclinical information routinely used by radiologists. In real-world screening,\ndetecting subtle or emerging lesions requires radiologists to compare across\ntimepoints and consider previous radiology assessments, such as the BI-RADS\nscore. We propose LesiOnTime, a novel 3D segmentation approach that mimics\nclinical diagnostic workflows by jointly leveraging longitudinal imaging and\nBIRADS scores.

In this paper, we compare two different reinitialization\nschemes: reinitializing units vs reinitializing weights.

We compare our algorithm\nto continual backpropagation and ReDo, two previously proposed algorithms that\nreinitialize units in the network. Through our experiments in continual\nsupervised learning problems, we identify two settings when reinitializing\nweights is more effective at maintaining plasticity than reinitializing units:\n(1) when the network has a small number of units and (2) when the network\nincludes layer normalization.

While prior efforts prune or merge tokens to address this issue,\nthey often rely on special tokens (e.g., CLS) or require task-specific\ntraining, hindering scalability across architectures. In this paper, we propose\nHiPrune, a training-free and model-agnostic token Pruning framework that\nexploits the Hierarchical attention structure within vision encoders. We\nidentify that middle layers attend to object-centric regions, while deep layers\ncapture global contextual features. Based on this observation, HiPrune selects\nthree types of informative tokens: (1) Anchor tokens with high attention in\nobject-centric layers, (2) Buffer tokens adjacent to anchors for spatial\ncontinuity, and (3) Register tokens with strong attention in deep layers for\nglobal summarization. Our method requires no retraining and integrates\nseamlessly with any ViT-based VLM.

With the rise of large language\nmodels (LLMs), there is a growing interest in using LLMs for graph model\ngeneration. Nevertheless, LLM-based graph model generation typically produces\npartially correct models that suffer from three main issues: (1) syntax\nviolations: the generated model may not adhere to the syntax defined by its\nmetamodel, (2) constraint inconsistencies: the structure of the model might not\nconform to some domain-specific constraints, and (3) inaccuracy: due to the\ninherent uncertainty in LLMs, the models can include inaccurate, hallucinated\nelements. While the first issue is often addressed through techniques such as\nconstraint decoding or filtering, the latter two remain largely unaddressed.\nMotivated by recent self-consistency approaches in LLMs, we propose a novel\nabstraction-concretization framework that enhances the consistency and quality\nof generated graph models by considering multiple outputs from an LLM.

Consequently, experiments on the KITTI and\nnuScenes datasets demonstrate significant improvements over previous\nunsupervised monocular end-to-end two-frame-based methods and exhibit strong\nperformance in challenging highway scenes where other approaches often fail.\nAdditionally, comprehensive ablation studies validate the effectiveness of\ncross-frame uncertainty propagation.", "AI": {"tldr": "CoProU-VO\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u5e27\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f20\u64ad\u6539\u8fdb\u89c6\u89c9\u91cc\u7a0b\u8ba1\uff0c\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u52a8\u6001\u7269\u4f53\u8fdd\u53cd\u9759\u6001\u573a\u666f\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u89c6\u89c9\u91cc\u7a0b\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCoProU-VO\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u76ee\u6807\u5e27\u548c\u53c2\u8003\u5e27\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6982\u7387\u516c\u5f0f\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u5e27\u4f20\u64ad\u3002", "result": "\u5728KITTI\u548cnuScenes\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u9ad8\u901f\u516c\u8def\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8de8\u5e27\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f20\u64ad\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u91cc\u7a0b\u8ba1\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Despite the progress in extending\nVIIRS-like NTL time-series, current methods still suffer from two significant\nshortcomings: the underestimation of light intensity and the structural\nomission. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel reconstruction\nframework consisting of a two-stage process: construction and refinement.

However, in complex real-world scenes, characterized by\nextreme viewpoint and scale changes as well as pronounced depth\ndiscontinuities, the motion field often exhibits diverse and heterogeneous\nmotion patterns. Most existing methods lack targeted modeling strategies and\nfail to explicitly account for this variability, resulting in estimated motion\nfields that diverge from their true underlying structure and distribution. We\nobserve that Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) can assign dedicated experts to motion\nsub-fields, enabling a divide-and-conquer strategy for heterogeneous motion\npatterns. Building on this insight, we re-architect motion field modeling in\ntwo-view geometry with GeoMoE, a streamlined framework. Specifically, we first\ndevise a Probabilistic Prior-Guided Decomposition strategy that exploits inlier\nprobability signals to perform a structure-aware decomposition of the motion\nfield into heterogeneous sub-fields, sharply curbing outlier-induced bias.\nNext, we introduce an MoE-Enhanced Bi-Path Rectifier that enhances each\nsub-field along spatial-context and channel-semantic paths and routes it to a\ncustomized expert for targeted modeling, thereby decoupling heterogeneous\nmotion regimes, suppressing cross-sub-field interference and representational\nentanglement, and yielding fine-grained motion-field rectification. With this\nminimalist design, GeoMoE outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods in\nrelative pose and homography estimation and shows strong generalization.

With the development of deep learning\ntechnologies, adopting pre-trained models for this task has become mainstream.\nConsidering the retrieval efficiency, most of the previous approaches adopt a\ndual-encoder for this task, which encodes the description and code snippet into\nrepresentation vectors, respectively. However, the model structure of the\ndual-encoder tends to limit the model's performance, since it lacks the\ninteraction between the code snippet and description at the bottom layer of the\nmodel during training. To improve the model's effectiveness while preserving\nits efficiency, we propose a framework, which adopts Self-AdaPtive Model\nDistillation for Efficient CodE Retrieval, named SPENCER.

Traditional detection systems typically focus on\nidentifying malicious activity in binary terms (benign or malicious) without\naccounting for the progression of an attack. However, effective response\nstrategies depend on accurate inference of the attack's current stage, as\ncountermeasures must be tailored to whether an adversary is in the early\nreconnaissance phase or actively conducting exploitation or exfiltration. This\nwork addresses the problem of attack stage inference under uncertainty, with a\nfocus on robustness to out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. We propose a\nclassification approach based on Evidential Deep Learning (EDL), which models\npredictive uncertainty by outputting parameters of a Dirichlet distribution\nover possible stages. This allows the system not only to predict the most\nlikely stage of an attack but also to indicate when it is uncertain or the\ninput lies outside the training distribution. Preliminary experiments in a\nsimulated environment demonstrate that the proposed model can accurately infer\nthe stage of an attack with calibrated confidence while effectively detecting\nOOD inputs, which may indicate changes in the attackers' tactics.

In\nparticular, we show that to securely compute one symbol of the desired input\nsum, each user must (i) transmit at least one symbol to others, (ii) hold at\nleast one symbol of secret key, and (iii) all users must collectively hold no\nfewer than $K - 1$ independent key symbols.

A key step in Bellman dynamic programming\nalgorithms is the policy evaluation, which becomes computationally demanding in\ninfinite-horizon settings such as average-reward or discounted-reward\nformulations. In the context of Markov chains, aggregation and disaggregation\ntechniques have for a long time been used to reduce complexity by exploiting\nstructural decompositions. In this work, we extend these principles to a\nstructured class of MDPs. We define the Single-Input Superstate Decomposable\nMarkov Decision Process (SISDMDP), which combines Chiu's single-input\ndecomposition with Robertazzi's single-cycle recurrence property. When a policy\ninduces this structure, the resulting transition graph can be decomposed into\ninteracting components with centralized recurrence. We develop an exact and\nefficient policy evaluation method based on this structure. This yields a\nscalable solution applicable to both average and discounted reward MDPs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u5177\u6709\u7279\u5b9a\u7ed3\u6784\u7684MDP\uff08SISDMDP\uff09\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u7b56\u7565\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86Chiu\u7684\u5355\u8f93\u5165\u5206\u89e3\u548cRobertazzi\u7684\u5355\u5faa\u73af\u9012\u5f52\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u957f\u671f\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u957f\u671f\u4f18\u5316MDP\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u65e0\u9650\u65f6\u95f4\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86SISDMDP\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5355\u8f93\u5165\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u5355\u5faa\u73af\u9012\u5f52\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u7b56\u7565\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5e73\u5747\u548c\u6298\u6263\u5956\u52b1MDP\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u7279\u5b9a\u7ed3\u6784\u7684MDP\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

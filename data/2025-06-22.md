### [1] [Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Multi-Satellite Earth Observation: A Realistic Case Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15207)
*Mohamad A. Hady,Siyi Hu,Mahardhika Pratama,Jimmy Cao,Ryszard Kowalczyk*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了利用强化学习（RL）和多智能体强化学习（MARL）解决低地球轨道（LEO）卫星在动态地球观测任务中的自主协调问题，并验证了MARL算法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着低地球轨道卫星数量的激增，传统优化方法难以满足动态地球观测任务的实时决策需求，因此需要探索RL和MARL的应用。

Method: 通过单卫星操作建模扩展到多卫星星座的MARL框架，解决了能源、数据存储限制及部分可观测下的分散协调问题，并在仿真环境中评估了PPO、IPPO、MAPPO和HAPPO等算法。

Result: 研究表明，MARL能有效平衡成像与资源管理，并解决多卫星协调中的非平稳性和奖励依赖性问题。

Conclusion: 该研究为自主卫星操作提供了基础，并为分散式地球观测任务中的策略学习提供了实用指南。

Abstract: The exponential growth of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites has revolutionised
Earth Observation (EO) missions, addressing challenges in climate monitoring,
disaster management, and more. However, autonomous coordination in
multi-satellite systems remains a fundamental challenge. Traditional
optimisation approaches struggle to handle the real-time decision-making
demands of dynamic EO missions, necessitating the use of Reinforcement Learning
(RL) and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). In this paper, we
investigate RL-based autonomous EO mission planning by modelling
single-satellite operations and extending to multi-satellite constellations
using MARL frameworks. We address key challenges, including energy and data
storage limitations, uncertainties in satellite observations, and the
complexities of decentralised coordination under partial observability. By
leveraging a near-realistic satellite simulation environment, we evaluate the
training stability and performance of state-of-the-art MARL algorithms,
including PPO, IPPO, MAPPO, and HAPPO. Our results demonstrate that MARL can
effectively balance imaging and resource management while addressing
non-stationarity and reward interdependency in multi-satellite coordination.
The insights gained from this study provide a foundation for autonomous
satellite operations, offering practical guidelines for improving policy
learning in decentralised EO missions.

### [2] [SwarmAgentic: Towards Fully Automated Agentic System Generation via Swarm Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15672)
*Yao Zhang,Chenyang Lin,Shijie Tang,Haokun Chen,Shijie Zhou,Yunpu Ma,Volker Tresp*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SwarmAgentic是一个完全自动化的代理系统生成框架，通过语言驱动探索和群体智能优化代理功能和协作，显著提升了任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代理系统生成框架缺乏完全自主性，限制了适应性和扩展性。

Method: SwarmAgentic通过语言驱动探索和群体智能优化代理功能和协作，采用类似粒子群优化的方法进化候选系统。

Result: 在六个真实任务中，SwarmAgentic显著优于基线方法，如在TravelPlanner任务中相对提升261.8%。

Conclusion: SwarmAgentic为可扩展和自主的代理系统设计迈出了重要一步，结合了群体智能和自动化代理生成。

Abstract: The rapid progress of Large Language Models has advanced agentic systems in
decision-making, coordination, and task execution. Yet, existing agentic system
generation frameworks lack full autonomy, missing from-scratch agent
generation, self-optimizing agent functionality, and collaboration, limiting
adaptability and scalability. We propose SwarmAgentic, a framework for fully
automated agentic system generation that constructs agentic systems from
scratch and jointly optimizes agent functionality and collaboration as
interdependent components through language-driven exploration. To enable
efficient search over system-level structures, SwarmAgentic maintains a
population of candidate systems and evolves them via feedback-guided updates,
drawing inspiration from Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). We evaluate our
method on six real-world, open-ended, and exploratory tasks involving
high-level planning, system-level coordination, and creative reasoning. Given
only a task description and an objective function, SwarmAgentic outperforms all
baselines, achieving a +261.8% relative improvement over ADAS on the
TravelPlanner benchmark, highlighting the effectiveness of full automation in
structurally unconstrained tasks. This framework marks a significant step
toward scalable and autonomous agentic system design, bridging swarm
intelligence with fully automated system multi-agent generation. Our code is
publicly released at https://yaoz720.github.io/SwarmAgentic/.

### [3] [CALM: Contextual Analog Logic with Multimodality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14936)
*Maxwell J. Jacobson,Corey J. Maley,Yexiang Xue*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CALM结合符号推理与神经生成，通过多模态数据实现上下文敏感决策，填补逻辑与神经感知之间的鸿沟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典二值逻辑系统无法捕捉人类决策的细微差别，且在多模态环境中需要人工基础。神经网络虽能提取多模态数据的丰富信息，但缺乏可解释的推理结构。CALM旨在整合两者，使AI系统更稳健。

Method: CALM通过域树表示谓词，神经网络迭代细化其模拟真值，并通过符号推理模块确保约束满足。

Result: 在填空物体放置任务中，CALM准确率达92.2%，优于经典逻辑（86.3%）和LLM（59.4%）。

Conclusion: CALM展示了在多模态环境中结合逻辑结构与偏好的潜力，为下一代AI系统奠定基础。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce Contextual Analog Logic with Multimodality (CALM).
CALM unites symbolic reasoning with neural generation, enabling systems to make
context-sensitive decisions grounded in real-world multi-modal data.
  Background: Classic bivalent logic systems cannot capture the nuance of human
decision-making. They also require human grounding in multi-modal environments,
which can be ad-hoc, rigid, and brittle. Neural networks are good at extracting
rich contextual information from multi-modal data, but lack interpretable
structures for reasoning.
  Objectives: CALM aims to bridge the gap between logic and neural perception,
creating an analog logic that can reason over multi-modal inputs. Without this
integration, AI systems remain either brittle or unstructured, unable to
generalize robustly to real-world tasks. In CALM, symbolic predicates evaluate
to analog truth values computed by neural networks and constrained search.
  Methods: CALM represents each predicate using a domain tree, which
iteratively refines its analog truth value when the contextual groundings of
its entities are determined. The iterative refinement is predicted by neural
networks capable of capturing multi-modal information and is filtered through a
symbolic reasoning module to ensure constraint satisfaction.
  Results: In fill-in-the-blank object placement tasks, CALM achieved 92.2%
accuracy, outperforming classical logic (86.3%) and LLM (59.4%) baselines. It
also demonstrated spatial heatmap generation aligned with logical constraints
and delicate human preferences, as shown by a human study.
  Conclusions: CALM demonstrates the potential to reason with logic structure
while aligning with preferences in multi-modal environments. It lays the
foundation for next-gen AI systems that require the precision and
interpretation of logic and the multimodal information processing of neural
networks.

### [4] [MEAL: A Benchmark for Continual Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14990)
*Tristan Tomilin,Luka van den Boogaard,Samuel Garcin,Bram Grooten,Meng Fang,Mykola Pechenizkiy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MEAL是首个针对持续多智能体强化学习（CMARL）的基准测试，利用JAX实现GPU加速，支持在普通台式机上快速完成100个任务的持续学习。研究发现，简单结合现有CL和MARL方法在复杂环境中表现不佳，需改进架构和算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有持续学习基准测试主要在CPU上运行，存在计算瓶颈，且缺乏针对多智能体协作环境的持续学习基准。

Method: 提出MEAL基准，利用JAX实现GPU加速，支持多任务序列的持续学习，并通过实验验证现有方法的局限性。

Result: 在简单环境中，现有方法表现良好，但在复杂环境中需要改进架构和算法以实现持续协作和适应。

Conclusion: MEAL为CMARL研究提供了高效工具，并揭示了现有方法的不足，为未来研究指明方向。

Abstract: Benchmarks play a crucial role in the development and analysis of
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, with environment availability strongly
impacting research. One particularly underexplored intersection is continual
learning (CL) in cooperative multi-agent settings. To remedy this, we introduce
MEAL (Multi-agent Environments for Adaptive Learning), the first benchmark
tailored for continual multi-agent reinforcement learning (CMARL). Existing CL
benchmarks run environments on the CPU, leading to computational bottlenecks
and limiting the length of task sequences. MEAL leverages JAX for GPU
acceleration, enabling continual learning across sequences of 100 tasks on a
standard desktop PC in a few hours. We show that naively combining popular CL
and MARL methods yields strong performance on simple environments, but fails to
scale to more complex settings requiring sustained coordination and adaptation.
Our ablation study identifies architectural and algorithmic features critical
for CMARL on MEAL.

### [5] [Truncated Proximal Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15050)

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为T-PPO的新方法，通过优化策略更新和限制生成长度，显著提升了大型语言模型（LLM）的训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PPO方法因同步长生成过程导致硬件利用率低，训练效率低下，尤其是在生成长响应时。

Method: 提出T-PPO，结合EGAE优势估计和选择性过滤机制，优化策略与价值模型的独立训练。

Result: 在AIME 2024上验证，T-PPO将训练效率提升2.5倍，并优于现有方法。

Conclusion: T-PPO通过高效策略更新和计算优化，显著提升了LLM的训练效率，适用于长响应生成任务。

Abstract: Recently, test-time scaling Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
exceptional reasoning capabilities across scientific and professional tasks by
generating long chains-of-thought (CoT). As a crucial component for developing
these reasoning models, reinforcement learning (RL), exemplified by Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO) and its variants, allows models to learn through
trial and error. However, PPO can be time-consuming due to its inherent
on-policy nature, which is further exacerbated by increasing response lengths.
In this work, we propose Truncated Proximal Policy Optimization (T-PPO), a
novel extension to PPO that improves training efficiency by streamlining policy
update and length-restricted response generation. T-PPO mitigates the issue of
low hardware utilization, an inherent drawback of fully synchronized
long-generation procedures, where resources often sit idle during the waiting
periods for complete rollouts. Our contributions are two-folds. First, we
propose Extended Generalized Advantage Estimation (EGAE) for advantage
estimation derived from incomplete responses while maintaining the integrity of
policy learning. Second, we devise a computationally optimized mechanism that
allows for the independent optimization of the policy and value models. By
selectively filtering prompt and truncated tokens, this mechanism reduces
redundant computations and accelerates the training process without sacrificing
convergence performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficacy of T-PPO
on AIME 2024 with a 32B base model. The experimental results show that T-PPO
improves the training efficiency of reasoning LLMs by up to 2.5x and
outperforms its existing competitors.

### [6] [HeurAgenix: Leveraging LLMs for Solving Complex Combinatorial Optimization Challenges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15196)
*Xianliang Yang,Ling Zhang,Haolong Qian,Lei Song,Jiang Bian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HeurAgenix是一个基于大语言模型（LLM）的两阶段超启发式框架，用于自动生成和选择启发式算法以解决组合优化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统启发式算法依赖人工设计且难以泛化，HeurAgenix旨在通过LLM自动化和优化这一过程。

Method: 框架分为启发式演化阶段和动态选择阶段，利用LLM提取策略并选择最优启发式，同时采用双奖励机制微调轻量级选择器。

Result: 实验表明，HeurAgenix优于现有基于LLM的超启发式方法，甚至媲美专业求解器。

Conclusion: HeurAgenix展示了LLM在组合优化中的潜力，提供了一种灵活且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Heuristic algorithms play a vital role in solving combinatorial optimization
(CO) problems, yet traditional designs depend heavily on manual expertise and
struggle to generalize across diverse instances. We introduce
\textbf{HeurAgenix}, a two-stage hyper-heuristic framework powered by large
language models (LLMs) that first evolves heuristics and then selects among
them automatically. In the heuristic evolution phase, HeurAgenix leverages an
LLM to compare seed heuristic solutions with higher-quality solutions and
extract reusable evolution strategies. During problem solving, it dynamically
picks the most promising heuristic for each problem state, guided by the LLM's
perception ability. For flexibility, this selector can be either a
state-of-the-art LLM or a fine-tuned lightweight model with lower inference
cost. To mitigate the scarcity of reliable supervision caused by CO complexity,
we fine-tune the lightweight heuristic selector with a dual-reward mechanism
that jointly exploits singals from selection preferences and state perception,
enabling robust selection under noisy annotations. Extensive experiments on
canonical benchmarks show that HeurAgenix not only outperforms existing
LLM-based hyper-heuristics but also matches or exceeds specialized solvers.

### [7] [Joint Computation Offloading and Resource Allocation for Uncertain Maritime MEC via Cooperation of UAVs and Vessels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15225)
*Jiahao You,Ziye Jia,Chao Dong,Qihui Wu,Zhu Han*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于无人机和船舶协作的海上计算卸载与资源分配框架，利用Lyapunov优化和马尔可夫博弈解决任务不确定性，并通过仿真验证了有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海上物联网（MIoT）的计算需求快速增长，但任务不确定性导致计算卸载和资源分配效率低下，亟需解决方案。

Method: 提出协作MEC框架，结合Lyapunov优化处理任务不确定性，将问题转化为马尔可夫博弈，并设计异构智能体软演员-评论家算法求解。

Result: 仿真验证了所提框架在计算卸载和资源分配中的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过无人机和船舶协作，结合优化算法，可有效解决海上物联网中的计算卸载和资源分配问题。

Abstract: The computation demands from the maritime Internet of Things (MIoT) increase
rapidly in recent years, and the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and vessels
based multi-access edge computing (MEC) can fulfill these MIoT requirements.
However, the uncertain maritime tasks present significant challenges of
inefficient computation offloading and resource allocation. In this paper, we
focus on the maritime computation offloading and resource allocation through
the cooperation of UAVs and vessels, with consideration of uncertain tasks.
Specifically, we propose a cooperative MEC framework for computation offloading
and resource allocation, including MIoT devices, UAVs and vessels. Then, we
formulate the optimization problem to minimize the total execution time. As for
the uncertain MIoT tasks, we leverage Lyapunov optimization to tackle the
unpredictable task arrivals and varying computational resource availability. By
converting the long-term constraints into short-term constraints, we obtain a
set of small-scale optimization problems. Further, considering the
heterogeneity of actions and resources of UAVs and vessels, we reformulate the
small-scale optimization problem into a Markov game (MG). Moreover, a
heterogeneous-agent soft actor-critic is proposed to sequentially update
various neural networks and effectively solve the MG problem. Finally,
simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness in addressing
computational offloading and resource allocation.

### [8] [Efficient and Generalizable Environmental Understanding for Visual Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15377)
*Ruoyu Wang,Xinshu Li,Chen Wang,Lina Yao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于因果关系的导航方法（CAN），通过引入因果理解模块提升导航性能，实验证明其优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有导航方法通常同时处理所有历史观测数据，忽略了数据内部的关联结构，限制了任务性能的进一步提升。

Method: 通过因果视角分析导航任务，提出CAN方法，包含因果理解模块以增强环境理解能力。

Result: 实验表明，CAN在多种任务和仿真环境中均优于基线方法，且因果理解模块在强化学习和监督学习中都有效。

Conclusion: CAN通过因果理解模块显著提升了导航性能，且无需额外计算开销。

Abstract: Visual Navigation is a core task in Embodied AI, enabling agents to navigate
complex environments toward given objectives. Across diverse settings within
Navigation tasks, many necessitate the modelling of sequential data accumulated
from preceding time steps. While existing methods perform well, they typically
process all historical observations simultaneously, overlooking the internal
association structure within the data, which may limit the potential for
further improvements in task performance. We address this by examining the
unique characteristics of Navigation tasks through the lens of causality,
introducing a causal framework to highlight the limitations of conventional
sequential methods. Leveraging this insight, we propose Causality-Aware
Navigation (CAN), which incorporates a Causal Understanding Module to enhance
the agent's environmental understanding capability. Empirical evaluations show
that our approach consistently outperforms baselines across various tasks and
simulation environments. Extensive ablations studies attribute these gains to
the Causal Understanding Module, which generalizes effectively in both
Reinforcement and Supervised Learning settings without computational overhead.

### [9] [Managing Complex Failure Analysis Workflows with LLM-based Reasoning and Acting Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15567)
*Aline Dobrovsky,Konstantin Schekotihin,Christian Burmer*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文探讨了基于大型语言模型（LLM）的规划代理（LPA）在故障分析（FA）中的设计与实现，旨在通过AI自动化任务并提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 故障分析过程复杂且知识密集，AI组件的整合可自动化任务，但需解决多模型协同工作的挑战。

Method: 设计并实现了一个结合LLM与高级规划能力的LPA，支持复杂查询处理、外部数据检索及生成可读响应。

Result: 评估表明LPA在支持FA任务中具有操作有效性和可靠性。

Conclusion: LPA为FA工程师提供了一种高效、可靠的AI辅助工具，解决了多模型协同的挑战。

Abstract: Failure Analysis (FA) is a highly intricate and knowledge-intensive process.
The integration of AI components within the computational infrastructure of FA
labs has the potential to automate a variety of tasks, including the detection
of non-conformities in images, the retrieval of analogous cases from diverse
data sources, and the generation of reports from annotated images. However, as
the number of deployed AI models increases, the challenge lies in orchestrating
these components into cohesive and efficient workflows that seamlessly
integrate with the FA process.
  This paper investigates the design and implementation of a Large Language
Model (LLM)-based Planning Agent (LPA) to assist FA engineers in solving their
analysis cases. The LPA integrates LLMs with advanced planning capabilities and
external tool utilization, enabling autonomous processing of complex queries,
retrieval of relevant data from external systems, and generation of
human-readable responses. Evaluation results demonstrate the agent's
operational effectiveness and reliability in supporting FA tasks.

### [10] [The Effect of State Representation on LLM Agent Behavior in Dynamic Routing Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15624)
*Lyle Goodyear,Rachel Guo,Ramesh Johari*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个统一框架，用于构建自然语言状态表示，以指导LLM在多智能体游戏中的决策行为，解决了以往研究中状态表示不一致的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在动态环境中作为决策者表现出潜力，但其无状态特性需要自然语言历史表示。以往研究对游戏历史的编码方式不一致，影响了行为分析和研究可比性。

Method: 通过三个维度（动作信息性、奖励信息性和提示风格）系统化构建自然语言状态表示，并在自私路由游戏中验证。

Result: 发现状态表示对LLM行为有显著影响：总结性表示、后悔信息而非原始收益、限制他人动作信息的行为更接近博弈论均衡预测。

Conclusion: 自然语言状态表示的设计对LLM在多智能体游戏中的行为稳定性和均衡匹配至关重要。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise as decision-makers in dynamic
settings, but their stateless nature necessitates creating a natural language
representation of history. We present a unifying framework for systematically
constructing natural language "state" representations for prompting LLM agents
in repeated multi-agent games. Previous work on games with LLM agents has taken
an ad hoc approach to encoding game history, which not only obscures the impact
of state representation on agents' behavior, but also limits comparability
between studies. Our framework addresses these gaps by characterizing methods
of state representation along three axes: action informativeness (i.e., the
extent to which the state representation captures actions played); reward
informativeness (i.e., the extent to which the state representation describes
rewards obtained); and prompting style (or natural language compression, i.e.,
the extent to which the full text history is summarized).
  We apply this framework to a dynamic selfish routing game, chosen because it
admits a simple equilibrium both in theory and in human subject experiments
\cite{rapoport_choice_2009}. Despite the game's relative simplicity, we find
that there are key dependencies of LLM agent behavior on the natural language
state representation. In particular, we observe that representations which
provide agents with (1) summarized, rather than complete, natural language
representations of past history; (2) information about regrets, rather than raw
payoffs; and (3) limited information about others' actions lead to behavior
that more closely matches game theoretic equilibrium predictions, and with more
stable game play by the agents. By contrast, other representations can exhibit
either large deviations from equilibrium, higher variation in dynamic game play
over time, or both.

*Yining Hong,Rui Sun,Bingxuan Li,Xingcheng Yao,Maxine Wu,Alexander Chien,Da Yin,Ying Nian Wu,Zhecan James Wang,Kai-Wei Chang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新型AI代理范式'Embodied Web Agents'，旨在融合物理世界交互与网络推理能力，解决跨领域任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI代理多为孤立系统，无法同时处理物理交互与网络信息，限制了其在需要跨领域智能的任务中的应用。

Method: 开发了统一的仿真平台'Embodied Web Agents task environments'，结合3D环境与网络接口，并构建了包含多种任务的基准测试。

Result: 实验显示现有AI系统与人类能力存在显著差距，揭示了跨领域智能的挑战与机遇。

Conclusion: 论文提出了融合物理与数字智能的新范式，并公开了数据集与代码，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: AI agents today are mostly siloed - they either retrieve and reason over vast
amount of digital information and knowledge obtained online; or interact with
the physical world through embodied perception, planning and action - but
rarely both. This separation limits their ability to solve tasks that require
integrated physical and digital intelligence, such as cooking from online
recipes, navigating with dynamic map data, or interpreting real-world landmarks
using web knowledge. We introduce Embodied Web Agents, a novel paradigm for AI
agents that fluidly bridge embodiment and web-scale reasoning. To
operationalize this concept, we first develop the Embodied Web Agents task
environments, a unified simulation platform that tightly integrates realistic
3D indoor and outdoor environments with functional web interfaces. Building
upon this platform, we construct and release the Embodied Web Agents Benchmark,
which encompasses a diverse suite of tasks including cooking, navigation,
shopping, tourism, and geolocation - all requiring coordinated reasoning across
physical and digital realms for systematic assessment of cross-domain
intelligence. Experimental results reveal significant performance gaps between
state-of-the-art AI systems and human capabilities, establishing both
challenges and opportunities at the intersection of embodied cognition and
web-scale knowledge access. All datasets, codes and websites are publicly
available at our project page https://embodied-web-agent.github.io/.

### [12] [The AI Policy Module: Developing Computer Science Student Competency in AI Ethics and Policy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15639)
*James Weichert,Daniel Dunlap,Mohammed Farghally,Hoda Eldardiry*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了AI政策教育在计算机科学课程中的重要性，并介绍了一个AI政策模块及其效果评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前计算机科学课程未能充分培养学生将AI伦理原则和政策偏好转化为实践的能力，需填补这一教育空白。

Method: 开发并测试了一个AI政策模块（2.0版），包括技术作业和前后问卷调查。

Result: 学生参与后对AI伦理问题的关注度提升，且对参与AI政策讨论的信心增强。

Conclusion: AI政策模块是有效的教育工具，能帮助学生理解政策在解决AI伦理挑战中的作用。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) further embeds itself into many settings
across personal and professional contexts, increasing attention must be paid
not only to AI ethics, but also to the governance and regulation of AI
technologies through AI policy. However, the prevailing post-secondary
computing curriculum is currently ill-equipped to prepare future AI
practitioners to confront increasing demands to implement abstract ethical
principles and normative policy preferences into the design and development of
AI systems. We believe that familiarity with the 'AI policy landscape' and the
ability to translate ethical principles to practices will in the future
constitute an important responsibility for even the most technically-focused AI
engineers.
  Toward preparing current computer science (CS) students for these new
expectations, we developed an AI Policy Module to introduce discussions of AI
policy into the CS curriculum. Building on a successful pilot in fall 2024, in
this innovative practice full paper we present an updated and expanded version
of the module, including a technical assignment on "AI regulation". We present
the findings from our pilot of the AI Policy Module 2.0, evaluating student
attitudes towards AI ethics and policy through pre- and post-module surveys.
Following the module, students reported increased concern about the ethical
impacts of AI technologies while also expressing greater confidence in their
abilities to engage in discussions about AI regulation. Finally, we highlight
the AI Regulation Assignment as an effective and engaging tool for exploring
the limits of AI alignment and emphasizing the role of 'policy' in addressing
ethical challenges.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large reasoning models (LRMs) have significantly
enhanced language models' capabilities in complex problem-solving by emulating
human-like deliberative thinking. However, these models often exhibit
overthinking (i.e., the generation of unnecessarily verbose and redundant
content), which hinders efficiency and inflates inference cost. In this work,
we explore the representational and behavioral origins of this inefficiency,
revealing that LRMs inherently possess the capacity for more concise reasoning.
Empirical analyses show that correct reasoning paths vary significantly in
length, and the shortest correct responses often suffice, indicating untapped
efficiency potential. Exploiting these findings, we propose two lightweight
methods to enhance LRM efficiency. First, we introduce Efficiency Steering, a
training-free activation steering technique that modulates reasoning behavior
via a single direction in the model's representation space. Second, we develop
Self-Rewarded Efficiency RL, a reinforcement learning framework that
dynamically balances task accuracy and brevity by rewarding concise correct
solutions. Extensive experiments on seven LRM backbones across multiple
mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our methods significantly
reduce reasoning length while preserving or improving task performance. Our
results highlight that reasoning efficiency can be improved by leveraging and
guiding the intrinsic capabilities of existing models in a self-guided manner.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一个针对老年患者出院摘要中不良事件（AE）提取的手工标注语料库，填补了临床NLP资源中老年人群代表性不足的问题。标注支持不连续和重叠实体，评估了多种模型在不同粒度下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 老年患者在临床NLP资源中代表性不足，需要专门的数据集来支持不良事件提取研究。

Method: 构建了一个包含14种临床显著不良事件及其上下文属性的标注语料库，使用FlairNLP评估了多种模型在三个不同粒度下的性能。

Result: BERT等模型在粗粒度文档级任务中表现优异（F1=0.943），但在细粒度实体级任务中表现下降（F1=0.675），尤其是罕见事件和复杂属性。

Conclusion: 尽管整体性能较高，但在检测代表性不足的不良事件和捕捉临床语言细微差别方面仍存在挑战，该数据集为未来研究提供了基准。

Abstract: In this work, we present a manually annotated corpus for Adverse Event (AE)
extraction from discharge summaries of elderly patients, a population often
underrepresented in clinical NLP resources. The dataset includes 14 clinically
significant AEs-such as falls, delirium, and intracranial haemorrhage, along
with contextual attributes like negation, diagnosis type, and in-hospital
occurrence. Uniquely, the annotation schema supports both discontinuous and
overlapping entities, addressing challenges rarely tackled in prior work. We
evaluate multiple models using FlairNLP across three annotation granularities:
fine-grained, coarse-grained, and coarse-grained with negation. While
transformer-based models (e.g., BERT-cased) achieve strong performance on
document-level coarse-grained extraction (F1 = 0.943), performance drops
notably for fine-grained entity-level tasks (e.g., F1 = 0.675), particularly
for rare events and complex attributes. These results demonstrate that despite
high-level scores, significant challenges remain in detecting underrepresented
AEs and capturing nuanced clinical language. Developed within a Trusted
Research Environment (TRE), the dataset is available upon request via DataLoch
and serves as a robust benchmark for evaluating AE extraction methods and
supporting future cross-dataset generalisation.

*Marija Šakota,Robert West*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BoostCD通过结合约束和无约束解码的两阶段方法，提升结构化NLP任务的输出质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在训练时未显式考虑约束，导致测试时约束解码输出质量低。

Method: BoostCD分两阶段：阶段1分别进行约束和无约束解码，阶段2通过增强模型结合两者预测。

Result: BoostIE在封闭信息抽取任务中表现优于现有方法，分布内外均有提升。

Conclusion: BoostCD有效解决了约束解码中的常见错误，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Many recent approaches to structured NLP tasks use an autoregressive language
model $M$ to map unstructured input text $x$ to output text $y$ representing
structured objects (such as tuples, lists, trees, code, etc.), where the
desired output structure is enforced via constrained decoding. During training,
these approaches do not require the model to be aware of the constraints, which
are merely implicit in the training outputs $y$. This is advantageous as it
allows for dynamic constraints without requiring retraining, but can lead to
low-quality output during constrained decoding at test time. We overcome this
problem with Boosted Constrained Decoding (BoostCD), which combines constrained
and unconstrained decoding in two phases: Phase 1 decodes from the base model
$M$ twice, in constrained and unconstrained mode, obtaining two weak
predictions. In phase 2, a learned autoregressive boosted model combines the
two weak predictions into one final prediction. The mistakes made by the base
model with vs. without constraints tend to be complementary, which the boosted
model learns to exploit for improved performance. We demonstrate the power of
BoostCD by applying it to closed information extraction. Our model, BoostIE,
outperforms prior approaches both in and out of distribution, addressing
several common errors identified in those approaches.

TL;DR: CrEst是一个弱监督框架，用于评估LLM推理中上下文文档的可信度，无需人工标注，通过文档间一致性实现自动化评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法常忽略上下文文档的可信度问题，可能导致不可靠信息的传播。

Method: 提出CrEst框架，基于文档间语义一致性评估可信度，并提供黑盒和白盒两种集成策略。

Result: 在三个模型架构和五个数据集上，CrEst显著优于基线，准确率提升26.86%，F1分数提高3.49%。

Conclusion: CrEst在无人工标注情况下有效提升LLM推理的可信度，且在高噪声条件下表现稳健。

Abstract: The integration of contextual information has significantly enhanced the
performance of large language models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive tasks.
However, existing methods often overlook a critical challenge: the credibility
of context documents can vary widely, potentially leading to the propagation of
unreliable information. In this paper, we introduce CrEst, a novel weakly
supervised framework for assessing the credibility of context documents during
LLM inference--without requiring manual annotations. Our approach is grounded
in the insight that credible documents tend to exhibit higher semantic
coherence with other credible documents, enabling automated credibility
estimation through inter-document agreement. To incorporate credibility into
LLM inference, we propose two integration strategies: a black-box approach for
models without access to internal weights or activations, and a white-box
method that directly modifies attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments
across three model architectures and five datasets demonstrate that CrEst
consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving up to a 26.86% improvement
in accuracy and a 3.49% increase in F1 score. Further analysis shows that CrEst
maintains robust performance even under high-noise conditions.

TL;DR: MDBench是一个用于评估大语言模型在多文档推理任务中的新数据集，通过合成生成方法高效创建挑战性文档集和问答示例。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型处理长上下文输入能力的提升，多文档推理成为重要研究方向，但缺乏相关基准测试。传统方法标注长输入成本高昂。

Method: 采用基于结构化种子知识的合成生成技术，通过LLM辅助编辑生成挑战性文档集和问答示例。

Result: MDBench对现有LLM和提示技术均构成显著挑战，且知识引导生成技术能快速适应新挑战。

Conclusion: MDBench为多文档推理提供了高效、可控的评估工具，并能灵活应对未来模型改进。

Abstract: Natural language processing evaluation has made significant progress, largely
driven by the proliferation of powerful large language mod-els (LLMs). New
evaluation benchmarks are of increasing priority as the reasoning capabilities
of LLMs are expanding at a rapid pace. In particular, while multi-document (MD)
reasoning is an area of extreme relevance given LLM capabilities in handling
longer-context inputs, few benchmarks exist to rigorously examine model
behavior in this setting. Moreover, the multi-document setting is historically
challenging for benchmark creation due to the expensive cost of annotating long
inputs. In this work, we introduce MDBench, a new dataset for evaluating LLMs
on the task of multi-document reasoning. Notably, MDBench is created through a
novel synthetic generation process, allowing us to controllably and efficiently
generate challenging document sets and the corresponding question-answer (QA)
examples. Our novel technique operates on condensed structured seed knowledge,
modifying it through LLM-assisted edits to induce MD-specific reasoning
challenges. We then convert this structured knowledge into a natural text
surface form, generating a document set and corresponding QA example. We
analyze the behavior of popular LLMs and prompting techniques, finding that
MDBENCH poses significant challenges for all methods, even with relatively
short document sets. We also see our knowledge-guided generation technique (1)
allows us to readily perform targeted analysis of MD-specific reasoning
capabilities and (2) can be adapted quickly to account for new challenges and
future modeling improvements.

*Shadman Sakib,Oishy Fatema Akhand,Ajwad Abrar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在糖尿病预测中的有效性，比较了零样本、单样本和三样本提示方法，发现专有模型（如GPT-4o）表现优于开源模型，且Gemma-2-27B在F1分数上超越了传统机器学习模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管机器学习和深度学习模型已广泛用于糖尿病预测，但LLMs在结构化数值数据中的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 使用Pima Indian Diabetes Database（PIDD），评估了六种LLMs（包括开源和专有模型）以及三种传统机器学习模型，采用准确率、精确率、召回率和F1分数作为评估指标。

Result: 专有LLMs表现优于开源模型，GPT-4o和Gemma-2-27B在少样本设置中表现最佳，Gemma-2-27B的F1分数超过传统模型。

Conclusion: LLMs在医疗预测任务中具有潜力，未来需关注提示工程和混合方法以提升性能。

Abstract: While Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models have been widely
used for diabetes prediction, the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for
structured numerical data is still not well explored. In this study, we test
the effectiveness of LLMs in predicting diabetes using zero-shot, one-shot, and
three-shot prompting methods. We conduct an empirical analysis using the Pima
Indian Diabetes Database (PIDD). We evaluate six LLMs, including four
open-source models: Gemma-2-27B, Mistral-7B, Llama-3.1-8B, and Llama-3.2-2B. We
also test two proprietary models: GPT-4o and Gemini Flash 2.0. In addition, we
compare their performance with three traditional machine learning models:
Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). We use
accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score as evaluation metrics. Our results
show that proprietary LLMs perform better than open-source ones, with GPT-4o
and Gemma-2-27B achieving the highest accuracy in few-shot settings. Notably,
Gemma-2-27B also outperforms the traditional ML models in terms of F1-score.
However, there are still issues such as performance variation across prompting
strategies and the need for domain-specific fine-tuning. This study shows that
LLMs can be useful for medical prediction tasks and encourages future work on
prompt engineering and hybrid approaches to improve healthcare predictions.

TL;DR: 研究发现，通过引入特殊记忆令牌，可以生成可逆的句子嵌入，使LLM在不修改模型权重的情况下精确重建原始文本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM是否能够在不改变模型权重的情况下，通过特定嵌入实现精确文本重建。

Method: 引入特殊记忆令牌，并通过训练优化其嵌入，使其能够重建固定序列。

Result: 在英语和西班牙语数据集上，模型（包括Llama 3.1 8B）成功重建了长达240个令牌的序列。

Conclusion: 这一发现展示了LLM的新能力，并可能在记忆检索、压缩和受控文本生成中有潜在应用。

Abstract: In this work, we observe an interesting phenomenon: it is possible to
generate reversible sentence embeddings that allow an LLM to reconstruct the
original text exactly, without modifying the model's weights. This is achieved
by introducing a special memory token, whose embedding is optimized through
training on a fixed sequence. When prompted with this embedding, the model
reconstructs the fixed sequence exactly. We evaluate this phenomenon across
English and Spanish datasets, sequences of up to approximately 240 tokens, and
model scales ranging from 100M to 8B parameters. Notably, Llama 3.1 8B
successfully reconstructs all tested sequences. Our findings highlight an
interesting capability of LLMs and suggest potential applications in
memory-based retrieval, compression, and controlled text generation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 使用自然语言处理技术分析执法和法医叙述，识别社会隔离和孤独感，开发高质量分类器，并发现特定人群（如男性、同性恋者、离婚者）更容易被分类为慢性社会隔离。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社会隔离和孤独感近年增加，与自杀率密切相关，但未被美国国家暴力死亡报告系统（NVDRS）记录，因此需要新方法识别这些因素。

Method: 利用主题建模生成词典开发，并结合监督学习分类器，分析2002至2020年30万例自杀案例。

Result: 开发出高质量分类器（平均F1：0.86，准确率：0.82），识别出1,198例慢性社会隔离案例，并发现特定人群（如男性、同性恋者、离婚者）风险更高。

Conclusion: 该方法可改进美国对社会隔离和孤独感的监测与预防。

Abstract: Social isolation and loneliness, which have been increasing in recent years
strongly contribute toward suicide rates. Although social isolation and
loneliness are not currently recorded within the US National Violent Death
Reporting System's (NVDRS) structured variables, natural language processing
(NLP) techniques can be used to identify these constructs in law enforcement
and coroner medical examiner narratives. Using topic modeling to generate
lexicon development and supervised learning classifiers, we developed
high-quality classifiers (average F1: .86, accuracy: .82). Evaluating over
300,000 suicides from 2002 to 2020, we identified 1,198 mentioning chronic
social isolation. Decedents had higher odds of chronic social isolation
classification if they were men (OR = 1.44; CI: 1.24, 1.69, p<.0001), gay (OR =
3.68; 1.97, 6.33, p<.0001), or were divorced (OR = 3.34; 2.68, 4.19, p<.0001).
We found significant predictors for other social isolation topics of recent or
impending divorce, child custody loss, eviction or recent move, and break-up.
Our methods can improve surveillance and prevention of social isolation and
loneliness in the United States.

TL;DR: PrefBERT是一种用于评估开放式长文本生成的评分模型，通过提供比传统指标更优的语义奖励反馈，支持GRPO训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在评估开放式长文本生成时，常忽略关键方面（如连贯性、风格或相关性）或受预训练数据偏差影响，导致该问题研究不足。

Method: 提出PrefBERT，基于两个多样化长文本风格和质量评分的响应评估数据集进行训练，为GRPO提供语义奖励反馈。

Result: PrefBERT在多句子和段落长度的响应评估中表现可靠，与传统指标（如ROUGE-L和BERTScore）相比，更符合人类偏好。

Conclusion: PrefBERT作为奖励信号训练策略模型，生成的响应更符合人类偏好，优于传统指标训练的模型。

Abstract: Evaluating open-ended long-form generation is challenging because it is hard
to define what clearly separates good from bad outputs. Existing methods often
miss key aspects like coherence, style, or relevance, or are biased by
pretraining data, making open-ended long-form evaluation an underexplored
problem. To address this gap, we propose PrefBERT, a scoring model for
evaluating open-ended long-form generation in GRPO and guiding its training
with distinct rewards for good and bad outputs. Trained on two response
evaluation datasets with diverse long-form styles and Likert-rated quality,
PrefBERT effectively supports GRPO by offering better semantic reward feedback
than traditional metrics ROUGE-L and BERTScore do. Through comprehensive
evaluations, including LLM-as-a-judge, human ratings, and qualitative analysis,
we show that PrefBERT, trained on multi-sentence and paragraph-length
responses, remains reliable across varied long passages and aligns well with
the verifiable rewards GRPO needs. Human evaluations confirm that using
PrefBERT as the reward signal to train policy models yields responses better
aligned with human preferences than those trained with traditional metrics. Our
code is available at https://github.com/zli12321/long_form_rl.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了学习阶段知识编码对后验知识遗忘效果的影响，发现使用转述描述可提升遗忘性能，但遗忘文本块中的单个知识仍具挑战性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLMs）的广泛应用，后验遗忘特定知识的需求日益重要，涉及隐私法规和内容更新等问题。

Method: 通过实验研究学习阶段知识编码对遗忘效果的影响，重点关注转述描述和文本块中的知识遗忘。

Result: 发现使用转述描述可提升遗忘性能，但遗忘文本块中的单个知识较为困难。

Conclusion: 学习阶段的知识编码对实现可靠的后验遗忘具有重要作用。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in the real world,
the ability to ``unlearn'', or remove specific pieces of knowledge post hoc,
has become essential for a variety of reasons ranging from privacy regulations
to correcting outdated or harmful content. Prior work has proposed unlearning
benchmarks and algorithms, and has typically assumed that the training process
and the target model are fixed. In this work, we empirically investigate how
learning-time choices in knowledge encoding impact the effectiveness of
unlearning factual knowledge. Our experiments reveal two key findings: (1)
learning with paraphrased descriptions improves unlearning performance and (2)
unlearning individual piece of knowledge from a chunk of text is challenging.
Our results suggest that learning-time knowledge encoding may play a central
role in enabling reliable post-hoc unlearning.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种对话话语解析方法，通过引入话语感知澄清模块（DCM）和贡献感知偏好优化（CPO）来解决对话中的歧义问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对话中的语言特征（如省略和习语）常导致话语关系模糊，增加了解析难度，因此需要一种新方法来增强解析器的性能。

Method: 提出DCM模块，包含澄清类型推理和话语目标推理；引入CPO以减少错误澄清的负面影响。

Result: 在STAC和Molweni数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: DCM和CPO的结合有效解决了对话中的歧义问题，提升了话语解析的性能。

Abstract: Dialogue discourse parsing aims to identify and analyze discourse relations
between the utterances within dialogues. However, linguistic features in
dialogues, such as omission and idiom, frequently introduce ambiguities that
obscure the intended discourse relations, posing significant challenges for
parsers. To address this issue, we propose a Discourse-aware Clarification
Module (DCM) to enhance the performance of the dialogue discourse parser. DCM
employs two distinct reasoning processes: clarification type reasoning and
discourse goal reasoning. The former analyzes linguistic features, while the
latter distinguishes the intended relation from the ambiguous one. Furthermore,
we introduce Contribution-aware Preference Optimization (CPO) to mitigate the
risk of erroneous clarifications, thereby reducing cascading errors. CPO
enables the parser to assess the contributions of the clarifications from DCM
and provide feedback to optimize the DCM, enhancing its adaptability and
alignment with the parser's requirements. Extensive experiments on the STAC and
Molweni datasets demonstrate that our approach effectively resolves ambiguities
and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines.

Result: 在MIMIC-III数据集上，诊断准确率提升9%，F1-score提高27%，推理速度加快22.2倍。

Conclusion: CKD-EHR框架显著提升了资源利用效率和诊断准确性，为临床资源优化提供了实用技术方案。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR)-based disease prediction models have
demonstrated significant clinical value in promoting precision medicine and
enabling early intervention. However, existing large language models face two
major challenges: insufficient representation of medical knowledge and low
efficiency in clinical deployment. To address these challenges, this study
proposes the CKD-EHR (Clinical Knowledge Distillation for EHR) framework, which
achieves efficient and accurate disease risk prediction through knowledge
distillation techniques. Specifically, the large language model Qwen2.5-7B is
first fine-tuned on medical knowledge-enhanced data to serve as the teacher
model.It then generates interpretable soft labels through a multi-granularity
attention distillation mechanism. Finally, the distilled knowledge is
transferred to a lightweight BERT student model. Experimental results show that
on the MIMIC-III dataset, CKD-EHR significantly outperforms the baseline
model:diagnostic accuracy is increased by 9%, F1-score is improved by 27%, and
a 22.2 times inference speedup is achieved. This innovative solution not only
greatly improves resource utilization efficiency but also significantly
enhances the accuracy and timeliness of diagnosis, providing a practical
technical approach for resource optimization in clinical settings. The code and
data for this research are available athttps://github.com/209506702/CKD_EHR.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种两阶段框架（MRG和PS）来建模开放域对话的一对多属性，通过新数据集o2mDial和改进的学习策略，显著提升了小规模LLM的多样性和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放域对话具有一对多属性，但现有LLM未明确建模此特性，限制了多样性和质量。

Method: 将对话生成分解为多响应生成（MRG）和偏好选择（PS），并引入o2mDial数据集及新学习策略和评估指标。

Result: 实验表明，该框架显著提升小规模LLM的响应多样性和质量（提升达90%），接近大规模模型性能。

Conclusion: 两阶段框架有效建模一对多属性，为小规模LLM在开放域对话中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Open-domain Dialogue (OD) exhibits a one-to-many (o2m) property, whereby
multiple appropriate responses exist for a single dialogue context. Despite
prior research showing that modeling this property boosts response diversity,
most modern LLM-based dialogue agents do not explicitly do so. In this work, we
model the o2m property of OD in LLMs by decomposing OD generation into two key
tasks: Multi-Response Generation (MRG) and Preference-based Selection (PS),
which entail generating a set of n semantically and lexically diverse
high-quality responses for a given dialogue context, followed by selecting a
single response based on human preference, respectively. To facilitate MRG and
PS, we introduce o2mDial, a dialogue corpus explicitly designed to capture the
o2m property by featuring multiple plausible responses for each context.
Leveraging o2mDial, we propose new in-context learning and instruction-tuning
strategies, as well as novel evaluation metrics for MRG, alongside a
model-based approach for PS. Empirical results demonstrate that applying the
proposed two-stage framework to smaller LLMs for OD generation enhances overall
response diversity while maintaining contextual coherence, improving response
quality by up to 90%, bringing them closer to the performance of larger models.

TL;DR: 论文提出Predictive Generation (PredGen)框架，通过预测性解码减少LLMs在实时语音聊天中的延迟，提升用户体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在实时语音聊天中因生成首句延迟导致音频输出滞后，影响用户体验，尤其是在计算能力有限的消费级硬件上。

Method: 提出PredGen框架，利用用户仍在说话时的预测性解码生成候选响应，提前启动TTS处理以减少延迟。

Result: 在Lmsys和MT-Bench数据集上的模拟实验显示，该方法可将延迟降低约2倍，且额外计算成本极低。

Conclusion: PredGen能有效减少LLMs在实时语音应用中的延迟，显著提升用户体验，同时计算开销可控。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in real-time voice chat
applications, typically in combination with text-to-speech (TTS) systems to
generate audio responses. However, their large size often leads to noticeable
latency between the end of user input and the start of audio output, resulting
in suboptimal user experiences. This latency is particularly evident when LLMs
are deployed as single-user voice assistants on consumer-grade hardware with
limited computing capacity. We discovered that this latency is primarily
dominated by the time it takes for the LLMs to generate the first sentence,
which is required as input by the TTS systems that synthesize audio responses
on a sentence-by-sentence basis. To address this bottleneck, we propose
Predictive Generation (PredGen), a novel framework that mitigates-or even
eliminates-this delay through speculative decoding at input time. PredGen
generates candidate responses while the user is still speaking, enabling the
system to begin TTS processing with minimal delay. Simulated experiments on the
Lmsys and MT-Bench datasets show that the proposed method can effectively
reduce the latency by around 2x across a wide range of use cases, while
incurring only minimal additional computation cost at input time-computation
that would otherwise go unused.

Motivation: 设计一种高效的韩语分词器，减少分词数量（降低fertility）而不影响模型性能。

Method: 采用规则预分词方法，结合韩语语言结构，并使用分支熵选择算法构建种子词汇表。

Result: 实验显示，Thunder-Tok比BPE减少约10%的分词数量，提升推理速度10%，且不影响下游任务性能。

Conclusion: 基于语言学的方法设计高效分词器是可行且实用的。

Abstract: This paper introduces Thunder-Tok, a new Korean tokenizer designed to reduce
token fertility without compromising model performance. Our approach uses a
rule-based pre-tokenization method that aligns with the linguistic structure of
the Korean language. We also create a seed vocabulary containing tokens that
resemble linguistic units and employ a branching entropy-based selection
algorithm. These techniques increase the average token length, thus lowering
fertility while preserving linguistic information. Experimental results
indicate that Thunder-Tok reduces fertility by approximately 10% (i.e., reduces
the number of tokens by 10%, improving the inference speed by 10%) compared to
BPE without compromising performance across various downstream tasks. These
findings demonstrate that our linguistically informed approach is effective and
practical for designing efficient tokenizers for language models.

Result: 模型表现出U型准确率曲线，揭示了长期记忆、短期记忆和动态记忆分配的三种机制。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了Mamba架构中记忆的动态分配机制，为理解语言模型的记忆行为提供了新视角。

Abstract: We study memory in state-space language models using primacy and recency
effects as behavioral tools to uncover how information is retained and
forgotten over time. Applying structured recall tasks to the Mamba
architecture, we observe a consistent U-shaped accuracy profile, indicating
strong performance at the beginning and end of input sequences. We identify
three mechanisms that give rise to this pattern. First, long-term memory is
supported by a sparse subset of channels within the model's selective state
space block, which persistently encode early input tokens and are causally
linked to primacy effects. Second, short-term memory is governed by
delta-modulated recurrence: recent inputs receive more weight due to
exponential decay, but this recency advantage collapses when distractor items
are introduced, revealing a clear limit to memory depth. Third, we find that
memory allocation is dynamically modulated by semantic regularity: repeated
relations in the input sequence shift the delta gating behavior, increasing the
tendency to forget intermediate items. We validate these findings via targeted
ablations and input perturbations on two large-scale Mamba-based language
models: one with 1.4B and another with 7B parameters.

TL;DR: 研究分析了专有和开源大型语言模型（LLMs）在可持续发展目标（SDGs）文本分类任务中的表现，并评估了零样本学习、少样本学习和微调等任务适应技术的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于SDGs数据规模庞大且复杂，追踪进展困难，文本分类模型和LLMs成为重要工具。

Method: 研究比较了不同LLMs在SDGs文本分类任务中的表现，并评估了零样本、少样本学习和微调的效果。

Result: 优化后的小型模型表现与大型模型（如GPT）相当。

Conclusion: 提示工程优化的小型模型在SDGs文本分类任务中具有竞争力。

Abstract: In 2012, the United Nations introduced 17 Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs) aimed at creating a more sustainable and improved future by 2030.
However, tracking progress toward these goals is difficult because of the
extensive scale and complexity of the data involved. Text classification models
have become vital tools in this area, automating the analysis of vast amounts
of text from a variety of sources. Additionally, large language models (LLMs)
have recently proven indispensable for many natural language processing tasks,
including text classification, thanks to their ability to recognize complex
linguistic patterns and semantics. This study analyzes various proprietary and
open-source LLMs for a single-label, multi-class text classification task
focused on the SDGs. Then, it also evaluates the effectiveness of task
adaptation techniques (i.e., in-context learning approaches), namely Zero-Shot
and Few-Shot Learning, as well as Fine-Tuning within this domain. The results
reveal that smaller models, when optimized through prompt engineering, can
perform on par with larger models like OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pre-trained
Transformer).

TL;DR: 论文提出ProtoReasoning框架，通过抽象推理原型提升大语言模型的推理能力，实验显示在多个任务上优于基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解大推理模型跨领域泛化能力的机制，假设其源于共享的抽象推理原型。

Method: 提出ProtoReasoning框架，包括自动化原型构建、验证系统和可扩展性问题合成。

Result: 在逻辑推理、规划任务、通用推理和数学任务上分别提升4.7%、6.3%、4.0%和1.0%。

Conclusion: 验证了推理原型是语言模型泛化能力的基础，学习原型空间优于自然语言表示。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) trained with Long
Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) reasoning have demonstrated remarkable cross-domain
generalization capabilities. However, the underlying mechanisms supporting such
transfer remain poorly understood. We hypothesize that cross-domain
generalization arises from shared abstract reasoning prototypes -- fundamental
reasoning patterns that capture the essence of problems across domains. These
prototypes minimize the nuances of the representation, revealing that seemingly
diverse tasks are grounded in shared reasoning structures.Based on this
hypothesis, we propose ProtoReasoning, a framework that enhances the reasoning
ability of LLMs by leveraging scalable and verifiable prototypical
representations (Prolog for logical reasoning, PDDL for
planning).ProtoReasoning features: (1) an automated prototype construction
pipeline that transforms problems into corresponding prototype representations;
(2) a comprehensive verification system providing reliable feedback through
Prolog/PDDL interpreters; (3) the scalability to synthesize problems
arbitrarily within prototype space while ensuring correctness. Extensive
experiments show that ProtoReasoning achieves 4.7% improvement over baseline
models on logical reasoning (Enigmata-Eval), 6.3% improvement on planning
tasks, 4.0% improvement on general reasoning (MMLU) and 1.0% on mathematics
(AIME24). Significantly, our ablation studies confirm that learning in
prototype space also demonstrates enhanced generalization to structurally
similar problems compared to training solely on natural language
representations, validating our hypothesis that reasoning prototypes serve as
the foundation for generalizable reasoning in large language models.

*Yongqi Fan,Yating Wang,Guandong Wang,Jie Zhai,Jingping Liu,Qi Ye,Tong Ruan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为MinosEval的新方法，用于评估开放性问题回答（QA）任务，通过区分事实性和非事实性问题并采用不同的评分策略，提高了评估的准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估指标（如ROUGE和BERTScore）在捕捉语义相似性方面表现不佳，且现有LLM评估方法缺乏直观解释性。此外，现有方法未区分事实性和非事实性问题。

Method: MinosEval首先区分开放性问题类型，对事实性问题采用自适应关键点评分策略，对非事实性问题采用实例感知的列表排序策略。

Result: 在多个开放QA数据集上的实验表明，MinosEval与人工标注更一致，并提供更可解释的结果。

Conclusion: MinosEval通过针对性策略解决了开放QA评估中的挑战，提升了评估效果和可解释性。

Abstract: Open-ended question answering (QA) is a key task for evaluating the
capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Compared to closed-ended QA, it
demands longer answer statements, more nuanced reasoning processes, and diverse
expressions, making refined and interpretable automatic evaluation both crucial
and challenging. Traditional metrics like ROUGE and BERTScore struggle to
capture semantic similarities due to different patterns between model responses
and reference answers. Current LLM-based evaluation approaches, such as
pairwise or listwise comparisons of candidate answers, lack intuitive
interpretability. While pointwise scoring of each response provides some
descriptions, it fails to adapt across different question contents. Most
notably, existing methods overlook the distinction between factoid and
non-factoid questions. To address these challenges, we propose
\textbf{MinosEval}, a novel evaluation method that first distinguishes
open-ended questions and then ranks candidate answers using different
evaluation strategies. For factoid questions, it applies an adaptive key-point
scoring strategy, while for non-factoid questions, it uses an instance-aware
listwise ranking strategy. Experiments on multiple open-ended QA datasets,
including self-built ones with more candidate responses to complement community
resources, show that MinosEval better aligns with human annotations and offers
more interpretable results.

Motivation: 评估语言技术对巴斯克语和西班牙语变体的处理能力，填补相关研究空白。

Method: 使用自然语言推理（NLI）任务，构建平行数据集，并进行跨语言和上下文学习实验。

Result: 语言变体（尤其是巴斯克语）导致性能下降，西部巴斯克语表现最差，与方言距离理论一致。

Conclusion: 语言变体对模型性能有显著影响，尤其是方言距离较远的变体，未来需针对性优化。

Abstract: In this paper, we evaluate the capacity of current language technologies to
understand Basque and Spanish language varieties. We use Natural Language
Inference (NLI) as a pivot task and introduce a novel, manually-curated
parallel dataset in Basque and Spanish, along with their respective variants.
Our empirical analysis of crosslingual and in-context learning experiments
using encoder-only and decoder-based Large Language Models (LLMs) shows a
performance drop when handling linguistic variation, especially in Basque.
Error analysis suggests that this decline is not due to lexical overlap, but
rather to the linguistic variation itself. Further ablation experiments
indicate that encoder-only models particularly struggle with Western Basque,
which aligns with linguistic theory that identifies peripheral dialects (e.g.,
Western) as more distant from the standard. All data and code are publicly
available.

Conclusion: Graph RAG为古典文本知识提取提供低资源解决方案，推动历史知识服务和人文研究。

Abstract: This article addresses domain knowledge gaps in general large language models
for historical text analysis in the context of computational humanities and
AIGC technology. We propose the Graph RAG framework, combining chain-of-thought
prompting, self-instruction generation, and process supervision to create a The
First Four Histories character relationship dataset with minimal manual
annotation. This dataset supports automated historical knowledge extraction,
reducing labor costs. In the graph-augmented generation phase, we introduce a
collaborative mechanism between knowledge graphs and retrieval-augmented
generation, improving the alignment of general models with historical
knowledge. Experiments show that the domain-specific model Xunzi-Qwen1.5-14B,
with Simplified Chinese input and chain-of-thought prompting, achieves optimal
performance in relation extraction (F1 = 0.68). The DeepSeek model integrated
with GraphRAG improves F1 by 11% (0.08-0.19) on the open-domain C-CLUE relation
extraction dataset, surpassing the F1 value of Xunzi-Qwen1.5-14B (0.12),
effectively alleviating hallucinations phenomenon, and improving
interpretability. This framework offers a low-resource solution for classical

Abstract: We present TopClustRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system
developed for the LiveRAG Challenge, which evaluates end-to-end question
answering over large-scale web corpora. Our system employs a hybrid retrieval
strategy combining sparse and dense indices, followed by K-Means clustering to

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Thunder-DeID的去标识化框架，用于解决韩国法院判决公开中的隐私保护问题，并通过实验验证了其高效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前韩国法院判决的去标识化过程无法满足大规模处理需求，且法律定义模糊，技术适配性差。

Method: 构建首个韩国法律数据集，系统分类个人身份信息（PII），开发基于深度神经网络的端到端去标识化流程。

Result: 模型在法院判决去标识化任务中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: Thunder-DeID框架有效解决了法律与技术适配问题，提升了去标识化效率。

Abstract: To ensure a balance between open access to justice and personal data
protection, the South Korean judiciary mandates the de-identification of court
judgments before they can be publicly disclosed. However, the current
de-identification process is inadequate for handling court judgments at scale
while adhering to strict legal requirements. Additionally, the legal
definitions and categorizations of personal identifiers are vague and not
well-suited for technical solutions. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
de-identification framework called Thunder-DeID, which aligns with relevant
laws and practices. Specifically, we (i) construct and release the first Korean
legal dataset containing annotated judgments along with corresponding lists of
entity mentions, (ii) introduce a systematic categorization of Personally
Identifiable Information (PII), and (iii) develop an end-to-end deep neural
network (DNN)-based de-identification pipeline. Our experimental results
demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in the
de-identification of court judgments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在通用NLP任务中表现优异，但在关键领域（如临床试验招募）的应用仍有限。LLMs的知识聚合和推理能力有望改进试验与患者的匹配任务。

Method: 论文通过调查分析，评估了现有的LLM辅助方法、基准测试和评估框架，并探讨了LLM技术在临床研究中的挑战。

Result: 研究发现，现有方法依赖专有模型和弱评估基准，限制了LLMs在临床试验招募中的广泛应用。

Conclusion: 论文提出了未来研究方向，强调需要更通用的解决方案和更强的评估框架，以推动LLMs在临床研究中的应用。

Abstract: Recent advances in LLMs have greatly improved general-domain NLP tasks. Yet,
their adoption in critical domains, such as clinical trial recruitment, remains
limited. As trials are designed in natural language and patient data is
represented as both structured and unstructured text, the task of matching
trials and patients benefits from knowledge aggregation and reasoning abilities
of LLMs. Classical approaches are trial-specific and LLMs with their ability to
consolidate distributed knowledge hold the potential to build a more general
solution. Yet recent applications of LLM-assisted methods rely on proprietary
models and weak evaluation benchmarks. In this survey, we are the first to
analyze the task of trial-patient matching and contextualize emerging LLM-based
approaches in clinical trial recruitment. We critically examine existing
benchmarks, approaches and evaluation frameworks, the challenges to adopting
LLM technologies in clinical research and exciting future directions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言在语言识别中因数据不平衡和领域限制导致的性能不佳问题。

Method: 采用监督对比学习（SCL）方法，学习领域不变的低资源语言表示。

Result: 在跨领域数据上，低资源语言的LID性能提高了3.2%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了低资源语言的LID性能，尤其在跨领域场景中表现显著。

Abstract: Language identification (LID) is a critical step in curating multilingual LLM
pretraining corpora from web crawls. While many studies on LID model training
focus on collecting diverse training data to improve performance, low-resource
languages -- often limited to single-domain data, such as the Bible -- continue
to perform poorly. To resolve these class imbalance and bias issues, we propose
a novel supervised contrastive learning (SCL) approach to learn
domain-invariant representations for low-resource languages. Through an
extensive analysis, we show that our approach improves LID performance on
out-of-domain data for low-resource languages by 3.2%, demonstrating its
effectiveness in enhancing LID models.

Method: 构建ICU出院记录数据集（真实与合成版本），评估五种LLMs在零样本和微调设置下的输入敏感性和下游推理能力。

Result: 零样本模型在反事实推理中更连贯，微调模型更稳定但对临床变化响应较弱；人口统计学因素对输出有微妙但持续影响。

Conclusion: 行为测试有助于揭示临床LLMs的推理策略，为设计更安全、透明的医疗AI系统提供依据。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in clinical decision
support, yet current evaluation methods often fail to distinguish genuine
medical reasoning from superficial patterns. We introduce DeVisE (Demographics
and Vital signs Evaluation), a behavioral testing framework for probing
fine-grained clinical understanding. We construct a dataset of ICU discharge
notes from MIMIC-IV, generating both raw (real-world) and template-based
(synthetic) versions with controlled single-variable counterfactuals targeting
demographic (age, gender, ethnicity) and vital sign attributes. We evaluate
five LLMs spanning general-purpose and medically fine-tuned variants, under
both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. We assess model behavior via (1)
input-level sensitivity - how counterfactuals alter the likelihood of a note;
and (2) downstream reasoning - how they affect predicted hospital
length-of-stay. Our results show that zero-shot models exhibit more coherent
counterfactual reasoning patterns, while fine-tuned models tend to be more
stable yet less responsive to clinically meaningful changes. Notably,
demographic factors subtly but consistently influence outputs, emphasizing the
importance of fairness-aware evaluation. This work highlights the utility of
behavioral testing in exposing the reasoning strategies of clinical LLMs and
informing the design of safer, more transparent medical AI systems.

Method: 通过构建SANSKRITI数据集，评估主流大语言模型、印度语言模型和小语言模型在文化相关查询上的表现。

Result: 许多模型在处理区域特定文化查询时表现不佳，显示出明显的文化理解差距。

Conclusion: SANSKRITI为评估和提升语言模型的文化理解能力设定了新标准。

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are indispensable tools shaping modern workflows, but
their global effectiveness depends on understanding local socio-cultural
contexts. To address this, we introduce SANSKRITI, a benchmark designed to
evaluate language models' comprehension of India's rich cultural diversity.
Comprising 21,853 meticulously curated question-answer pairs spanning 28 states
and 8 union territories, SANSKRITI is the largest dataset for testing Indian
cultural knowledge. It covers sixteen key attributes of Indian culture: rituals
and ceremonies, history, tourism, cuisine, dance and music, costume, language,
art, festivals, religion, medicine, transport, sports, nightlife, and
personalities, providing a comprehensive representation of India's cultural
tapestry. We evaluate SANSKRITI on leading Large Language Models (LLMs), Indic
Language Models (ILMs), and Small Language Models (SLMs), revealing significant
disparities in their ability to handle culturally nuanced queries, with many
models struggling in region-specific contexts. By offering an extensive,
culturally rich, and diverse dataset, SANSKRITI sets a new standard for
assessing and improving the cultural understanding of LMs.

Conclusion: COSMMIC填补了印度语言资源缺口，推动了NLP研究的包容性。

Abstract: Despite progress in comment-aware multimodal and multilingual summarization
for English and Chinese, research in Indian languages remains limited. This
study addresses this gap by introducing COSMMIC, a pioneering comment-sensitive
multimodal, multilingual dataset featuring nine major Indian languages. COSMMIC
comprises 4,959 article-image pairs and 24,484 reader comments, with
ground-truth summaries available in all included languages. Our approach
enhances summaries by integrating reader insights and feedback. We explore
summarization and headline generation across four configurations: (1) using
article text alone, (2) incorporating user comments, (3) utilizing images, and
(4) combining text, comments, and images. To assess the dataset's
effectiveness, we employ state-of-the-art language models such as LLama3 and
GPT-4. We conduct a comprehensive study to evaluate different component
combinations, including identifying supportive comments, filtering out noise
using a dedicated comment classifier using IndicBERT, and extracting valuable
insights from images with a multilingual CLIP-based classifier. This helps
determine the most effective configurations for natural language generation
(NLG) tasks. Unlike many existing datasets that are either text-only or lack
user comments in multimodal settings, COSMMIC uniquely integrates text, images,
and user feedback. This holistic approach bridges gaps in Indian language
resources, advancing NLP research and fostering inclusivity.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为TLI的新方法，通过针对性微调提升低资源语言（如斯瓦希里语）在大型语言模型中的词汇对齐能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低资源语言在大型语言模型中的表现较差，主要由于数据稀缺和预训练中的代表性不足。词汇对齐是关键挑战之一。

Method: 采用Targeted Lexical Injection（TLI）方法，结合LoRA和对比学习目标，针对模型早期层进行微调。

Result: TLI显著提升了斯瓦希里语-英语词汇对的输出层对齐，训练集和未见词汇对的相似度分别提高了28.08%和28.32%。

Conclusion: TLI是一种参数高效且有效的方法，能够增强模型在低资源语言中的词汇对齐能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, yet
their performance in low-resource languages (LRLs), such as Swahili, often lags
due to data scarcity and underrepresentation in pre-training. A key challenge
is achieving robust cross-lingual lexical alignment, crucial for tasks like
translation and cross-lingual information retrieval. This paper introduces
Targeted Lexical Injection (TLI), a novel and efficient fine-tuning approach.
We first demonstrate that Lugha-Llama-8B-wura, a Swahili-centric LLM, exhibits
strong, near-perfect lexical alignment for Swahili-English word pairs in its
early internal layers (specifically Layer 2, with ~0.99998 average cosine
similarity based on a pilot study), a capability not fully reflected in its
final output representations (baseline ~0.32 similarity on our evaluation set).
TLI leverages this insight by using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and a
contrastive learning objective to fine-tune the model, specifically targeting
embeddings from this empirically identified optimal early layer. Our
experiments show that TLI significantly improves the output-level lexical
alignment for 623 trained Swahili-English word pairs, increasing average cosine
similarity from 0.3211 to 0.4113 (+28.08%, p < 1.33 x 10^-240). More
importantly, these improvements generalize remarkably well to 63 unseen control
word pairs, with similarity increasing from 0.3143 to 0.4033 (+28.32%, p < 7.17
x 10^-27). These findings suggest TLI enhances the model's ability to preserve
and propagate its inherent early-layer cross-lingual knowledge, offering a
parameter-efficient and effective strategy for improving lexical alignment in
LRL-focused LLMs.

Result: 实验表明，框架和方法提升了GUI代理行为的可解释性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该研究为MLLMs在GUI代理中的应用提供了可操作的见解和改进方法。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled GUI agents to interact
with operating systems by grounding language into spatial actions. Despite
their promising performance, these models frequently exhibit
hallucinations-systematic localization errors that compromise reliability. We
propose a fine-grained evaluation framework that categorizes model predictions
into four distinct types, revealing nuanced failure modes beyond traditional
accuracy metrics. To better quantify model uncertainty, we introduce the Peak
Sharpness Score (PSS), a metric that evaluates the alignment between semantic
continuity and logits distribution in coordinate prediction. Building on this
insight, we further propose Context-Aware Cropping, a training-free technique
that improves model performance by adaptively refining input context. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework and methods provide actionable
insights and enhance the interpretability and robustness of GUI agent behavior.

current frameworks face critical challenges in system architecture design,
cross-domain generalizability, and performance guarantees, particularly as task
complexity and number of agents increases. We introduces AgentGroupChat-V2, a
novel framework addressing these challenges through three core innovations: (1)
a divide-and-conquer fully parallel architecture that decomposes user queries
into hierarchical task forest structures enabling dependency management and
distributed concurrent processing. (2) an adaptive collaboration engine that
dynamically selects heterogeneous LLM combinations and interaction modes based
on task characteristics. (3) agent organization optimization strategies
combining divide-and-conquer approaches for efficient problem decomposition.
Extensive experiments demonstrate AgentGroupChat-V2's superior performance
across diverse domains, achieving 91.50% accuracy on GSM8K (exceeding the best
baseline by 5.6 percentage points), 30.4% accuracy on competition-level AIME
(nearly doubling other methods), and 79.20% pass@1 on HumanEval. Performance
advantages become increasingly pronounced with higher task difficulty,
particularly on Level 5 MATH problems where improvements exceed 11 percentage
points compared to state-of-the-art baselines. These results confirm that
AgentGroupChat-V2 provides a comprehensive solution for building efficient,
general-purpose LLM multi-agent systems with significant advantages in complex
reasoning scenarios. Code is available at

TL;DR: RE-IMAGINE框架通过层次化推理能力评估LLMs，揭示其依赖统计记忆而非真正推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在推理任务中的表现是否源于真正推理还是训练数据的统计记忆。

Method: 引入RE-IMAGINE框架，生成不同层次的问题变体，评估LLMs在数学、代码和逻辑等领域的推理能力。

Result: LLMs在问题变体上表现下降，表明其依赖统计记忆。

Conclusion: 研究为针对推理层次能力的进一步研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have reported high accuracy on reasoning
benchmarks. However, it is still unclear whether the observed results arise
from true reasoning or from statistical recall of the training set. Inspired by
the ladder of causation (Pearl, 2009) and its three levels (associations,
interventions and counterfactuals), this paper introduces RE-IMAGINE, a
framework to characterize a hierarchy of reasoning ability in LLMs, alongside
an automated pipeline to generate problem variations at different levels of the
hierarchy. By altering problems in an intermediate symbolic representation,
RE-IMAGINE generates arbitrarily many problems that are not solvable using
memorization alone. Moreover, the framework is general and can work across
reasoning domains, including math, code, and logic. We demonstrate our
framework on four widely-used benchmarks to evaluate several families of LLMs,
and observe reductions in performance when the models are queried with problem
variations. These assessments indicate a degree of reliance on statistical
recall for past performance, and open the door to further research targeting
skills across the reasoning hierarchy.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CINGS的后训练监督方法，通过将相关上下文前置到响应中并仅计算响应标记的损失，增强了大型语言模型在外部知识上的生成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在推理时简单附加上下文无法确保生成的响应基于外部知识，因此需要一种更有效的方法来增强模型的生成能力。

Method: 提出CINGS方法，训练时将相关上下文前置到响应中，计算损失时仅考虑响应标记并屏蔽上下文。

Result: 实验表明，CINGS在文本和视觉领域均表现出更强的生成能力，且在多个基准测试中优于其他方法。

Conclusion: CINGS通过改变模型的先验知识和行为，显著提高了对外部上下文的依赖，同时不影响下游任务性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often supplemented with external knowledge
to provide information not encoded in their parameters or to reduce
hallucination. In such cases, we expect the model to generate responses by
grounding its response in the provided external context. However, prior work
has shown that simply appending context at inference time does not ensure
grounded generation. To address this, we propose Context-INformed Grounding
Supervision (CINGS), a post-training supervision in which the model is trained
with relevant context prepended to the response, while computing the loss only
over the response tokens and masking out the context. Our experiments
demonstrate that models trained with CINGS exhibit stronger grounding in both
textual and visual domains compared to standard instruction-tuned models. In
the text domain, CINGS outperforms other training methods across 11
information-seeking datasets and is complementary to inference-time grounding
techniques. In the vision-language domain, replacing a vision-language model's
LLM backbone with a CINGS-trained model reduces hallucinations across four
benchmarks and maintains factual consistency throughout the generated response.
This improved grounding comes without degradation in general downstream
performance. Finally, we analyze the mechanism underlying the enhanced
grounding in CINGS and find that it induces a shift in the model's prior
knowledge and behavior, implicitly encouraging greater reliance on the external
context.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高质量自动化过程标注的挑战，以提升LLM的复杂多步推理能力。

Method: 引入SPARE框架，通过单次标注和参考引导的步骤级评估，对齐参考解决方案中的步骤并提供明确推理。

Result: 在数学推理、多跳问答和空间推理任务中表现优异，效率提升2.6倍，运行时间减少至38%。

Conclusion: SPARE在推理性能和效率上均优于基线方法，为过程监督提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Process or step-wise supervision has played a crucial role in advancing
complex multi-step reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).
However, efficient, high-quality automated process annotation remains a
significant challenge. To address this, we introduce Single-Pass Annotation
with Reference-Guided Evaluation (SPARE), a novel structured framework that
enables single-pass, per-step annotation by aligning each solution step to one
or multiple steps in a reference solution, accompanied by explicit reasoning
for evaluation. We show that reference-guided step-level evaluation effectively
facilitates process supervision on four datasets spanning three domains:
mathematical reasoning, multi-hop compositional question answering, and spatial
reasoning. We demonstrate that SPARE, when compared to baselines, improves
reasoning performance when used for: (1) fine-tuning models in an offline RL
setup for inference-time greedy-decoding, and (2) training reward models for
ranking/aggregating multiple LLM-generated outputs. Additionally, SPARE
achieves competitive performance on challenging mathematical datasets while
offering 2.6 times greater efficiency, requiring only 38% of the runtime,
compared to tree search-based automatic annotation. The codebase, along with a
trained SPARE-PRM model, is publicly released to facilitate further research
and reproducibility.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于情感引导的双向动态交互框架（EmoBi），用于检测夸张和隐喻，通过情感分析和双向动态交互提升检测效果，实验表明其优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 夸张和隐喻在自然语言处理中具有重要意义，但由于语义模糊和表达多样性，检测难度大。现有方法多忽略情感关联和双向交互。

Method: EmoBi框架包含情感分析模块、基于情感的领域映射模块和双向动态交互模块，并设计了验证机制确保准确性。

Result: 在四个数据集上，EmoBi优于基线方法，F1分数在TroFi和HYPO-L数据集上分别提升28.1%和23.1%。

Conclusion: EmoBi框架通过情感引导和双向交互显著提升了夸张和隐喻检测的效果，具有潜在的应用价值。

Abstract: Text-based hyperbole and metaphor detection are of great significance for
natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, due to their semantic
obscurity and expressive diversity, it is rather challenging to identify them.
Existing methods mostly focus on superficial text features, ignoring the
associations of hyperbole and metaphor as well as the effect of implicit
emotion on perceiving these rhetorical devices. To implement these hypotheses,
we propose an emotion-guided hyperbole and metaphor detection framework based
on bidirectional dynamic interaction (EmoBi). Firstly, the emotion analysis
module deeply mines the emotion connotations behind hyperbole and metaphor.
Next, the emotion-based domain mapping module identifies the target and source
domains to gain a deeper understanding of the implicit meanings of hyperbole
and metaphor. Finally, the bidirectional dynamic interaction module enables the
mutual promotion between hyperbole and metaphor. Meanwhile, a verification
mechanism is designed to ensure detection accuracy and reliability. Experiments
show that EmoBi outperforms all baseline methods on four datasets.
Specifically, compared to the current SoTA, the F1 score increased by 28.1% for
hyperbole detection on the TroFi dataset and 23.1% for metaphor detection on
the HYPO-L dataset. These results, underpinned by in-depth analyses, underscore
the effectiveness and potential of our approach for advancing hyperbole and
metaphor detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在检索增强生成（RAG）中常出现的答案遗漏、错误引用或拒绝可用证据的问题。

Method: 使用GRPO方法，通过可验证结果奖励训练模型，分两阶段优化答案、引用和拒绝行为。

Result: 实验表明，推理增强模型在多个数据集上表现优于仅指令调优模型，尤其在处理不可回答查询和生成引用充分的回答时。

Conclusion: 结合推理、分阶段优化和结果驱动的强化学习可显著提升LLM的可验证性和可靠性。

Abstract: Generating grounded and trustworthy responses remains a key challenge for
large language models (LLMs). While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with
citation-based grounding holds promise, instruction-tuned models frequently
fail even in straightforward scenarios: missing explicitly stated answers,
citing incorrectly, or refusing when evidence is available. In this work, we
explore how reinforcement learning (RL) and internal reasoning can enhance
grounding in LLMs. We use the GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) method
to train models using verifiable outcome-based rewards targeting answer
correctness, citation sufficiency, and refusal quality, without requiring gold
reasoning traces or expensive annotations. Through comprehensive experiments
across ASQA, QAMPARI, ELI5, and ExpertQA we show that reasoning-augmented
models significantly outperform instruction-only variants, especially in
handling unanswerable queries and generating well-cited responses. A two-stage
training setup, first optimizing answer and citation behavior and then refusal,
further improves grounding by stabilizing the learning signal. Additionally, we
revisit instruction tuning via GPT-4 distillation and find that combining it
with GRPO enhances performance on long-form, generative QA tasks. Overall, our
findings highlight the value of reasoning, stage-wise optimization, and
outcome-driven RL for building more verifiable and reliable LLMs.

TL;DR: RATTENTION是一种结合局部注意力和线性注意力的新方法，旨在解决局部注意力忽略窗口外标记的问题，在性能和效率之间取得更好的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决局部注意力模型完全忽略窗口外标记的内在限制，提升短上下文场景下的效率。

Method: 提出RATTENTION，结合局部注意力和线性注意力机制，捕获窗口外标记的信息。

Result: 在3B和12B规模的预训练实验中，RATTENTION在512窗口大小下性能媲美全注意力模型，且训练效率不降低。

Conclusion: RATTENTION在性能和效率之间实现了更优的Pareto平衡，尤其适用于短上下文场景。

Abstract: Local-global attention models have recently emerged as compelling
alternatives to standard Transformers, promising improvements in both training
and inference efficiency. However, the crucial choice of window size presents a
Pareto tradeoff: larger windows maintain performance akin to full attention but
offer minimal efficiency gains in short-context scenarios, while smaller
windows can lead to performance degradation. Current models, such as Gemma2 and
Mistral, adopt conservative window sizes (e.g., 4096 out of an 8192 pretraining
length) to preserve performance. This work investigates strategies to shift
this Pareto frontier, enabling local-global models to achieve efficiency gains
even in short-context regimes. Our core motivation is to address the intrinsic
limitation of local attention -- its complete disregard for tokens outside the
defined window. We explore RATTENTION, a variant of local attention integrated
with a specialized linear attention mechanism designed to capture information
from these out-of-window tokens. Pretraining experiments at the 3B and 12B
scales demonstrate that RATTENTION achieves a superior Pareto tradeoff between
performance and efficiency. As a sweet spot, RATTENTION with a window size of
just 512 consistently matches the performance of full-attention models across
diverse settings. Furthermore, the recurrent nature inherent in the linear
attention component of RATTENTION contributes to enhanced long-context
performance, as validated on the RULER benchmark. Crucially, these improvements
do not compromise training efficiency; thanks to a specialized kernel
implementation and the reduced window size, RATTENTION maintains training
speeds comparable to existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Motivation: 现代语言模型通常公开权重但封闭训练数据，如何从权重中近似数据是一个重要问题。

Method: 提出梯度方法，从大型公共文本语料库中选择匹配度最高的数据，用于恢复训练数据。

Result: 在AG News分类任务中，性能从65%提升至80%；在MSMARCO文档任务中，困惑度从3.3降至2.3。

Conclusion: 该方法能从公开数据中恢复有效训练数据，显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Modern language models often have open weights but closed training data. We
formalize the problem of data approximation from model weights and propose
several baselines and metrics. We develop a gradient-based approach that
selects the highest-matching data from a large public text corpus and show its
effectiveness at recovering useful data given only weights of the original and
finetuned models. Even when none of the true training data is known, our method
is able to locate a small subset of public Web documents can be used to train a
model to close to the original model performance given models trained for both
classification and supervised-finetuning. On the AG News classification task,
our method improves performance from 65% (using randomly selected data) to 80%,
approaching the expert benchmark of 88%. When applied to a model trained with
SFT on MSMARCO web documents, our method reduces perplexity from 3.3 to 2.3,
compared to an expert LLAMA model's perplexity of 2.0.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注二元性别，缺乏对非二元性别包容性的评估，因此需要一种更全面的指标来衡量LLMs的性别公平性。

Method: 通过GIFI这一新指标，从多个层次（如代词使用、生成行为和认知行为）对22种不同规模和能力的LLMs进行了广泛评估。

Result: 研究发现LLMs在性别包容性上存在显著差异，揭示了与不同性别标识相关的偏见。

Conclusion: 研究强调了提高LLMs性别包容性的重要性，并为未来生成模型的性别公平性提供了关键基准。

Abstract: We present a comprehensive evaluation of gender fairness in large language
models (LLMs), focusing on their ability to handle both binary and non-binary
genders. While previous studies primarily focus on binary gender distinctions,
we introduce the Gender Inclusivity Fairness Index (GIFI), a novel and
comprehensive metric that quantifies the diverse gender inclusivity of LLMs.
GIFI consists of a wide range of evaluations at different levels, from simply
probing the model with respect to provided gender pronouns to testing various
aspects of model generation and cognitive behaviors under different gender
assumptions, revealing biases associated with varying gender identifiers. We
conduct extensive evaluations with GIFI on 22 prominent open-source and
proprietary LLMs of varying sizes and capabilities, discovering significant
variations in LLMs' gender inclusivity. Our study highlights the importance of
improving LLMs' inclusivity, providing a critical benchmark for future
advancements in gender fairness in generative models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本场景图解析器针对单句子设计，无法有效处理多句子描述中的跨句子共指等现象，导致图结构碎片化和下游任务性能下降。

Method: 提出DiscoSG-Refiner方法，使用两个小型PLM分别生成基础图和迭代修正图，以减少计算开销。

Result: DiscoSG-Refiner在SPICE指标上比最佳基线提升约30%，推理速度比GPT-4快86倍，并提升了下游任务性能。

Conclusion: DiscoSG-Refiner是一种高效且性能优越的多句子场景图解析方法，适用于开源环境。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) now generate discourse-level, multi-sentence
visual descriptions, challenging text scene graph parsers originally designed
for single-sentence caption-to-graph mapping. Current approaches typically
merge sentence-level parsing outputs for discourse input, often missing
phenomena like cross-sentence coreference, resulting in fragmented graphs and
degraded downstream VLM task performance. To address this, we introduce a new
task, Discourse-level text Scene Graph parsing (DiscoSG), supported by our
dataset DiscoSG-DS, which comprises 400 expert-annotated and 8,430 synthesised
multi-sentence caption-graph pairs for images. Each caption averages 9
sentences, and each graph contains at least 3 times more triples than those in
existing datasets. While fine-tuning large PLMs (i.e., GPT-4) on DiscoSG-DS
improves SPICE by approximately 48% over the best sentence-merging baseline,
high inference cost and restrictive licensing hinder its open-source use, and
smaller fine-tuned PLMs struggle with complex graphs. We propose
DiscoSG-Refiner, which drafts a base graph using one small PLM, then employs a
second PLM to iteratively propose graph edits, reducing full-graph generation
overhead. Using two Flan-T5-Base models, DiscoSG-Refiner still improves SPICE
by approximately 30% over the best baseline while achieving 86 times faster
inference than GPT-4. It also consistently improves downstream VLM tasks like
discourse-level caption evaluation and hallucination detection. Code and data

Motivation: 解决自动文档理解中复杂布局、表格和图表的挑战，评估视觉语言大模型在长上下文输入中的有效性。

Method: 构建WikiMixQA基准，包含1000个多选题，基于4000个维基百科页面的表格和图表，评估12种先进视觉语言模型。

Result: 专有模型在直接上下文下准确率约70%，但在长文档检索中显著下降；开源模型表现更差，最高准确率仅27%。

Conclusion: 长上下文多模态推理仍具挑战性，WikiMixQA为文档理解研究提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Documents are fundamental to preserving and disseminating information, often
incorporating complex layouts, tables, and charts that pose significant
challenges for automatic document understanding (DU). While vision-language
large models (VLLMs) have demonstrated improvements across various tasks, their
effectiveness in processing long-context vision inputs remains unclear. This
paper introduces WikiMixQA, a benchmark comprising 1,000 multiple-choice
questions (MCQs) designed to evaluate cross-modal reasoning over tables and
charts extracted from 4,000 Wikipedia pages spanning seven distinct topics.
Unlike existing benchmarks, WikiMixQA emphasizes complex reasoning by requiring
models to synthesize information from multiple modalities. We evaluate 12
state-of-the-art vision-language models, revealing that while proprietary
models achieve ~70% accuracy when provided with direct context, their
performance deteriorates significantly when retrieval from long documents is
required. Among these, GPT-4-o is the only model exceeding 50% accuracy in this
setting, whereas open-source models perform considerably worse, with a maximum
accuracy of 27%. These findings underscore the challenges of long-context,
multi-modal reasoning and establish WikiMixQA as a crucial benchmark for
advancing document understanding research.

Result: 当前模型生成的MCQ质量接近人工，但存在语义清晰度和干扰项设计问题。

Conclusion: 生成式AI在葡萄牙语MCQ生成中潜力显著，但需改进语义和干扰项设计以提升实用性。

Abstract: While MCQs are valuable for learning and evaluation, manually creating them
with varying difficulty levels and targeted reading skills remains a
time-consuming and costly task. Recent advances in generative AI provide an
opportunity to automate MCQ generation efficiently. However, assessing the
actual quality and reliability of generated MCQs has received limited attention
-- particularly regarding cases where generation fails. This aspect becomes
particularly important when the generated MCQs are meant to be applied in
real-world settings. Additionally, most MCQ generation studies focus on
English, leaving other languages underexplored. This paper investigates the
capabilities of current generative models in producing MCQs for reading
comprehension in Portuguese, a morphologically rich language. Our study focuses
on generating MCQs that align with curriculum-relevant narrative elements and
span different difficulty levels. We evaluate these MCQs through expert review
and by analyzing the psychometric properties extracted from student responses
to assess their suitability for elementary school students. Our results show
that current models can generate MCQs of comparable quality to human-authored
ones. However, we identify issues related to semantic clarity and
answerability. Also, challenges remain in generating distractors that engage
students and meet established criteria for high-quality MCQ option design.

Method: 提出数据集构建流程和三个新指标（S-CDI、RDS、GIC），用于识别后悔表征层和神经元功能分组。

Result: 成功识别最优后悔表征层（S-CDI），发现M形解耦模式，并通过RDS将神经元分为三类：后悔神经元、非后悔神经元和双功能神经元。

Conclusion: 提出的方法和指标有效解决了后悔机制研究中的关键挑战，为模型可靠性提升和认知编码研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: Regret in Large Language Models refers to their explicit regret expression
when presented with evidence contradicting their previously generated
misinformation. Studying the regret mechanism is crucial for enhancing model
reliability and helps in revealing how cognition is coded in neural networks.
To understand this mechanism, we need to first identify regret expressions in
model outputs, then analyze their internal representation. This analysis
requires examining the model's hidden states, where information processing
occurs at the neuron level. However, this faces three key challenges: (1) the
absence of specialized datasets capturing regret expressions, (2) the lack of
metrics to find the optimal regret representation layer, and (3) the lack of
metrics for identifying and analyzing regret neurons. Addressing these
limitations, we propose: (1) a workflow for constructing a comprehensive regret
dataset through strategically designed prompting scenarios, (2) the Supervised
Compression-Decoupling Index (S-CDI) metric to identify optimal regret
representation layers, and (3) the Regret Dominance Score (RDS) metric to
identify regret neurons and the Group Impact Coefficient (GIC) to analyze
activation patterns. Our experimental results successfully identified the
optimal regret representation layer using the S-CDI metric, which significantly
enhanced performance in probe classification experiments. Additionally, we
discovered an M-shaped decoupling pattern across model layers, revealing how
information processing alternates between coupling and decoupling phases.
Through the RDS metric, we categorized neurons into three distinct functional
groups: regret neurons, non-regret neurons, and dual neurons.

we report three experiments examining how speakers of British and American

these cross-cultural differences, we developed a computational cognitive model
where listeners recursively reason about speakers who balance informativity,
politeness, and utterance cost. Our model comparisons suggested that
cross-cultural differences in intensifier interpretation stem from a
combination of (1) different literal meanings, (2) different weights on
utterance cost. These findings challenge accounts based purely on semantic
variation or politeness norms, demonstrating that cross-cultural differences in
interpretation emerge from an intricate interplay between the two.

*Yusuke Sakai,Hidetaka Kamigaito,Taro Watanabe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了Ordered CommonGen基准，用于评估大语言模型（LLMs）的组合泛化和指令遵循能力，发现LLMs在指定概念顺序时存在偏差，且最高指令遵循率仅约75%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在生成符合指定概念顺序的句子时的能力，揭示其在指令遵循和组合泛化方面的不足。

Method: 提出Ordered CommonGen基准，通过有序覆盖率评估LLMs的能力，并分析了36种LLMs的表现。

Result: LLMs普遍能理解指令意图，但对特定顺序模式的偏好导致输出多样性低；最高指令遵循率仅75%。

Conclusion: LLMs在指令遵循和组合泛化方面仍需改进，Ordered CommonGen为未来研究提供了有效工具。

Abstract: In generative commonsense reasoning tasks such as CommonGen, generative large
language models (LLMs) compose sentences that include all given concepts.
However, when focusing on instruction-following capabilities, if a prompt
specifies a concept order, LLMs must generate sentences that adhere to the
specified order. To address this, we propose Ordered CommonGen, a benchmark
designed to evaluate the compositional generalization and instruction-following
abilities of LLMs. This benchmark measures ordered coverage to assess whether
concepts are generated in the specified order, enabling a simultaneous
evaluation of both abilities. We conducted a comprehensive analysis using 36
LLMs and found that, while LLMs generally understand the intent of
instructions, biases toward specific concept order patterns often lead to
low-diversity outputs or identical results even when the concept order is
altered. Moreover, even the most instruction-compliant LLM achieved only about
75% ordered coverage, highlighting the need for improvements in both
instruction-following and compositional generalization capabilities.

Motivation: 解决罗马尼亚文本的作者归属问题，并评估不同机器学习方法在ROST语料库上的表现。

Method: 使用SVM、LR、k-NN、DT、RF和ANN六种方法，基于字符n-gram特征进行分类。

Result: ANN模型表现最佳，其中5-gram特征在15次运行中有4次实现完美分类。

Conclusion: 轻量级字符n-gram方法在罗马尼亚作者归属任务中表现出色，适用于资源有限或研究较少的语言环境。

Abstract: This study addresses the problem of authorship attribution for Romanian texts
using the ROST corpus, a standard benchmark in the field. We systematically
evaluate six machine learning techniques: Support Vector Machine (SVM),
Logistic Regression (LR), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Decision Trees (DT),
Random Forests (RF), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), employing character
n-gram features for classification. Among these, the ANN model achieved the
highest performance, including perfect classification in four out of fifteen
runs when using 5-gram features. These results demonstrate that lightweight,
interpretable character n-gram approaches can deliver state-of-the-art accuracy
for Romanian authorship attribution, rivaling more complex methods. Our
findings highlight the potential of simple stylometric features in resource,
constrained or under-studied language settings.

TL;DR: CC-Learn通过强化学习框架提升LLM推理的可靠性，利用同类问题训练模型，优化复合目标以提高准确性和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在推理任务中表现不稳定，需要一种方法提升其一致性和鲁棒性。

Method: 提出CC-Learn框架，通过强化学习优化复合目标（包括同类问题准确性、检索奖励和拒绝惩罚），训练模型在同类问题上采用一致的推理模式。

Result: 在ARC-Challenge和StrategyQA等基准测试中，CC-Learn显著提升了模型的准确性和推理稳定性。

Conclusion: CC-Learn证明通过同类问题的强化学习可以有效提升LLM的推理一致性。

Abstract: Large language models excel at many tasks but still struggle with consistent,
robust reasoning. We introduce Cohort-based Consistency Learning (CC-Learn), a
reinforcement learning framework that improves the reliability of LLM reasoning
by training on cohorts of similar questions derived from shared programmatic
abstractions. To enforce cohort-level consistency, we define a composite
objective combining cohort accuracy, a retrieval bonus for effective problem
decomposition, and a rejection penalty for trivial or invalid lookups that
reinforcement learning can directly optimize, unlike supervised fine-tuning.
Optimizing this reward guides the model to adopt uniform reasoning patterns
across all cohort members. Experiments on challenging reasoning benchmarks
(including ARC-Challenge and StrategyQA) show that CC-Learn boosts both
accuracy and reasoning stability over pretrained and SFT baselines. These
results demonstrate that cohort-level RL effectively enhances reasoning
consistency in LLMs.

TL;DR: 研究发现大型推理模型的推理痕迹中存在隐私泄露风险，增加推理步骤会放大这种泄露，揭示了推理效用与隐私攻击面之间的核心矛盾。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战推理痕迹内部安全的假设，揭示其中可能包含的敏感用户数据泄露问题。

Method: 通过探测和代理评估，分析推理步骤增加对隐私泄露的影响。

Result: 增加推理步骤会提高模型答案的谨慎性，但也会导致更详细的推理痕迹和更多隐私泄露。

Conclusion: 安全措施需扩展到模型的内部推理过程，而不仅仅是最终输出。

Abstract: We study privacy leakage in the reasoning traces of large reasoning models
used as personal agents. Unlike final outputs, reasoning traces are often
assumed to be internal and safe. We challenge this assumption by showing that
reasoning traces frequently contain sensitive user data, which can be extracted
via prompt injections or accidentally leak into outputs. Through probing and
agentic evaluations, we demonstrate that test-time compute approaches,
particularly increased reasoning steps, amplify such leakage. While increasing
the budget of those test-time compute approaches makes models more cautious in
their final answers, it also leads them to reason more verbosely and leak more
in their own thinking. This reveals a core tension: reasoning improves utility
but enlarges the privacy attack surface. We argue that safety efforts must
extend to the model's internal thinking, not just its outputs.

Motivation: 性别包容的机器翻译需避免性别误判和代表性伤害，但在语法性别语言中保持性别中立具有挑战性。

Method: 评估21种机器翻译系统在三种不同难度的翻译方向中对性别模糊的敏感性，并分类观察到的性别中立策略。

Result: 大多数系统未能提供性别中立翻译，但少数系统根据目标语言采用了特定策略。

Conclusion: 性别中立翻译在机器翻译中仍不普遍，需进一步改进以应对性别模糊问题。

Abstract: Gender-inclusive machine translation (MT) should preserve gender ambiguity in
the source to avoid misgendering and representational harms. While gender
ambiguity often occurs naturally in notional gender languages such as English,
maintaining that gender neutrality in grammatical gender languages is a
challenge. Here we assess the sensitivity of 21 MT systems to the need for
gender neutrality in response to gender ambiguity in three translation
directions of varying difficulty. The specific gender-neutral strategies that
are observed in practice are categorized and discussed. Additionally, we
examine the effect of binary gender stereotypes on the use of gender-neutral
translation. In general, we report a disappointing absence of gender-neutral
translations in response to gender ambiguity. However, we observe a small
handful of MT systems that switch to gender neutral translation using specific
strategies, depending on the target language.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决资源受限设备上部署大型视觉语言模型（VLMs）的挑战，以及跨不同架构VLMs知识迁移的多样性问题。

Method: 提出GenRecal框架，包含Recalibrator模块，用于对齐和适配异构VLMs的特征表示。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，GenRecal显著优于基线模型，甚至超越大型开源和闭源VLMs。

Conclusion: GenRecal为跨架构VLMs知识蒸馏提供了一种有效解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have leveraged large
language models (LLMs) to achieve performance on par with closed-source systems
like GPT-4V. However, deploying these models in real-world scenarios,
particularly on resource-constrained devices, remains challenging due to their
substantial computational demands. This has spurred interest in distilling
knowledge from large VLMs into smaller, more efficient counterparts. A key
challenge arises here from the diversity of VLM architectures, which are built
on different LLMs and employ varying token types-differing in vocabulary size,
token splits, and token index ordering. To address this challenge of limitation
to a specific VLM type, we present Generation after Recalibration (GenRecal), a
novel, general-purpose distillation framework for VLMs. GenRecal incorporates a
Recalibrator that aligns and adapts feature representations between
heterogeneous VLMs, enabling effective knowledge transfer across different
types of VLMs. Through extensive experiments on multiple challenging
benchmarks, we demonstrate that GenRecal significantly improves baseline
performances, eventually outperforming large-scale open- and closed-source
VLMs.

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLM）的普及，虚假信息和学术不端等社会问题加剧，现有检测器对私有调优LLM生成文本的检测效果不佳，亟需新方法。

Method: 提出PhantomHunter，采用家族感知学习框架，捕捉基础模型及其衍生模型的共享特征，而非记忆个体特性。

Result: 在LLaMA、Gemma和Mistral家族数据上的实验表明，PhantomHunter优于7个基线方法和3个工业服务，F1分数超过96%。

Conclusion: PhantomHunter能有效检测私有调优LLM生成的文本，为解决相关社会问题提供了新工具。

Abstract: With the popularity of large language models (LLMs), undesirable societal
problems like misinformation production and academic misconduct have been more
severe, making LLM-generated text detection now of unprecedented importance.
Although existing methods have made remarkable progress, a new challenge posed
by text from privately tuned LLMs remains underexplored. Users could easily
possess private LLMs by fine-tuning an open-source one with private corpora,
resulting in a significant performance drop of existing detectors in practice.
To address this issue, we propose PhantomHunter, an LLM-generated text detector
specialized for detecting text from unseen, privately-tuned LLMs. Its
family-aware learning framework captures family-level traits shared across the
base models and their derivatives, instead of memorizing individual
characteristics. Experiments on data from LLaMA, Gemma, and Mistral families
show its superiority over 7 baselines and 3 industrial services, with F1 scores
of over 96%.

Abstract: Aiming at the problem of difficulty in accurately identifying graphical
implicit correlations in multimodal irony detection tasks, this paper proposes
a Semantic Irony Recognition Network (SemIRNet). The model contains three main
innovations: (1) The ConceptNet knowledge base is introduced for the first time
to acquire conceptual knowledge, which enhances the model's common-sense
reasoning ability; (2) Two cross-modal semantic similarity detection modules at

function is introduced to optimize the spatial distribution of the sample
features, which improves the separability of positive and negative samples.

incorporating real-world commonsense understanding to evaluate causal reasoning
abilities. Expanding on it, we present the Eye of Panoptes framework, which
integrates a binary parametric Sigmoid metric with an indicator function,
enabling a more holistic evaluation of MLLMs' responses in opinion-based

highest performance in visual fine-grained reasoning reaches only 0.46,
highlighting considerable potential for enhancement. Our research offers
valuable perspectives for the continued refinement of MLLMs.

Abstract: Monitoring animal populations in natural environments requires systems that
can interpret both visual data and human language queries. This work introduces
ViLLa (Vision-Language-Logic Approach), a neuro-symbolic framework designed for
interpretable animal monitoring. ViLLa integrates three core components: a
visual detection module for identifying animals and their spatial locations in
images, a language parser for understanding natural language queries, and a
symbolic reasoning layer that applies logic-based inference to answer those
queries. Given an image and a question such as "How many dogs are in the
scene?" or "Where is the buffalo?", the system grounds visual detections into
symbolic facts and uses predefined rules to compute accurate answers related to
count, presence, and location. Unlike end-to-end black-box models, ViLLa
separates perception, understanding, and reasoning, offering modularity and
transparency. The system was evaluated on a range of animal imagery tasks and
demonstrates the ability to bridge visual content with structured,
human-interpretable queries.

Conclusion: GraphGSOcc有效提升3D语义占用预测性能，同时优化计算资源。

Abstract: Addressing the task of 3D semantic occupancy prediction for autonomous
driving, we tackle two key issues in existing 3D Gaussian Splating (3DGS)
methods: (1) unified feature aggregation neglecting semantic correlations among
similar categories and across regions, and (2) boundary ambiguities caused by
the lack of geometric constraints in MLP iterative optimization. We propose the
GraphGSOcc model, a novel framework that combines semantic and geometric graph
Transformer for 3D Gaussian Splating-based Occupancy Prediction. We propose the
Dual Gaussians Graph Attenntion, which dynamically constructs dual graph
structures: a geometric graph adaptively calculating KNN search radii based on
Gaussian poses, enabling large-scale Gaussians to aggregate features from
broader neighborhoods while compact Gaussians focus on local geometric
consistency; a semantic graph retaining top-M highly correlated nodes via
cosine similarity to explicitly encode semantic relationships within and across
instances. Coupled with the Multi-scale Graph Attention framework, fine-grained
attention at lower layers optimizes boundary details, while coarse-grained
attention at higher layers models object-level topology. Experiments on the
SurroundOcc dataset achieve an mIoU of 24.10%, reducing GPU memory to 6.1 GB,
demonstrating a 1.97% mIoU improvement and 13.7% memory reduction compared to

Conclusion: 可解释检测方法为AI生成视频的可信识别提供了新方向。

Abstract: As AI-generated video becomes increasingly pervasive across media platforms,
the ability to reliably distinguish synthetic content from authentic footage
has become both urgent and essential. Existing approaches have primarily
treated this challenge as a binary classification task, offering limited
insight into where or why a model identifies a video as AI-generated. However,
the core challenge extends beyond simply detecting subtle artifacts; it
requires providing fine-grained, persuasive evidence that can convince auditors
and end-users alike. To address this critical gap, we introduce DAVID-X, the
first dataset to pair AI-generated videos with detailed defect-level,
temporal-spatial annotations and written rationales. Leveraging these rich
annotations, we present DAVID-XR1, a video-language model designed to deliver
an interpretable chain of visual reasoning-including defect categorization,
temporal-spatial localization, and natural language explanations. This approach
fundamentally transforms AI-generated video detection from an opaque black-box
decision into a transparent and verifiable diagnostic process. We demonstrate
that a general-purpose backbone, fine-tuned on our compact dataset and enhanced
with chain-of-thought distillation, achieves strong generalization across a
variety of generators and generation modes. Our results highlight the promise
of explainable detection methods for trustworthy identification of AI-generated
video content.

Motivation: 现有基于INR的视频压缩方法在细节密集和快速变化内容中表现不佳，主要原因是网络特征利用不足和缺乏视频特定设计。

Method: 提出MSNeRV框架，包括时间窗口增强时间一致性、GoP级网格背景表示、多尺度空间解码器和尺度自适应损失函数，以及多尺度特征块。

Result: 在HEVC ClassB和UVG数据集上，MSNeRV在表示能力和压缩效率上优于现有INR方法，并超越VTM-23.7。

Conclusion: MSNeRV通过多尺度特征融合和视频特定设计，显著提升了神经视频表示的性能和压缩效率。

Abstract: Implicit Neural representations (INRs) have emerged as a promising approach
for video compression, and have achieved comparable performance to the
state-of-the-art codecs such as H.266/VVC. However, existing INR-based methods
struggle to effectively represent detail-intensive and fast-changing video
content. This limitation mainly stems from the underutilization of internal
network features and the absence of video-specific considerations in network
design. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-scale feature fusion
framework, MSNeRV, for neural video representation. In the encoding stage, we
enhance temporal consistency by employing temporal windows, and divide the
video into multiple Groups of Pictures (GoPs), where a GoP-level grid is used
for background representation. Additionally, we design a multi-scale spatial
decoder with a scale-adaptive loss function to integrate multi-resolution and
multi-frequency information. To further improve feature extraction, we
introduce a multi-scale feature block that fully leverages hidden features. We
evaluate MSNeRV on HEVC ClassB and UVG datasets for video representation and
compression. Experimental results demonstrate that our model exhibits superior
representation capability among INR-based approaches and surpasses VTM-23.7
(Random Access) in dynamic scenarios in terms of compression efficiency.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了面部微表情（MEs）的识别、检测与生成，提出结合检测与识别的统一方法，并利用多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）和视觉语言模型（LVLMs）增强ME分析。MEGC 2025挑战赛引入两项任务：ME-STR（检测后识别）和ME-VQA（视觉问答）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将ME检测与识别分开处理，在长视频分析中效果不佳。多模态大语言模型的出现为ME分析提供了新思路。

Method: 提出两项任务：ME-STR（统一检测与识别流程）和ME-VQA（利用MLLMs/LVLMs进行视觉问答）。

Result: MEGC 2025挑战赛将评估参与算法在测试集上的表现。

Conclusion: 结合检测与识别的统一方法及多模态模型的应用，有望提升ME分析的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Facial micro-expressions (MEs) are involuntary movements of the face that
occur spontaneously when a person experiences an emotion but attempts to
suppress or repress the facial expression, typically found in a high-stakes
environment. In recent years, substantial advancements have been made in the
areas of ME recognition, spotting, and generation. However, conventional
approaches that treat spotting and recognition as separate tasks are
suboptimal, particularly for analyzing long-duration videos in realistic
settings. Concurrently, the emergence of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) and large vision-language models (LVLMs) offers promising new avenues
for enhancing ME analysis through their powerful multimodal reasoning
capabilities. The ME grand challenge (MEGC) 2025 introduces two tasks that
reflect these evolving research directions: (1) ME spot-then-recognize
(ME-STR), which integrates ME spotting and subsequent recognition in a unified
sequential pipeline; and (2) ME visual question answering (ME-VQA), which
explores ME understanding through visual question answering, leveraging MLLMs
or LVLMs to address diverse question types related to MEs. All participating
algorithms are required to run on this test set and submit their results on a
leaderboard. More details are available at https://megc2025.github.io.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MonoVQD框架通过Mask Separated Self-Attention、Variational Query Denoising和自蒸馏策略，显著提升了基于DETR的单目3D检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直接应用DETR架构在单目3D检测中存在固有局限性，导致性能不佳。

Method: 提出MonoVQD框架，包含Mask Separated Self-Attention机制、Variational Query Denoising技术和自蒸馏策略。

Result: 在KITTI和nuScenes数据集上表现出色，展示了强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: MonoVQD不仅提升了单目3D检测性能，其核心组件还可广泛应用于其他架构。

Abstract: Precisely localizing 3D objects from a single image constitutes a central
challenge in monocular 3D detection. While DETR-like architectures offer a
powerful paradigm, their direct application in this domain encounters inherent
limitations, preventing optimal performance. Our work addresses these
challenges by introducing MonoVQD, a novel framework designed to fundamentally
advance DETR-based monocular 3D detection. We propose three main contributions.
First, we propose the Mask Separated Self-Attention mechanism that enables the
integration of the denoising process into a DETR architecture. This improves
the stability of Hungarian matching to achieve a consistent optimization
objective. Second, we present the Variational Query Denoising technique to
address the gradient vanishing problem of conventional denoising methods, which
severely restricts the efficiency of the denoising process. This explicitly
introduces stochastic properties to mitigate this fundamental limitation and
unlock substantial performance gains. Finally, we introduce a sophisticated
self-distillation strategy, leveraging insights from later decoder layers to
synergistically improve query quality in earlier layers, thereby amplifying the
iterative refinement process. Rigorous experimentation demonstrates that
MonoVQD achieves superior performance on the challenging KITTI monocular
benchmark. Highlighting its broad applicability, MonoVQD's core components
seamlessly integrate into other architectures, delivering significant
performance gains even in multi-view 3D detection scenarios on the nuScenes
dataset and underscoring its robust generalization capabilities.

TL;DR: 视频-SALMONN 2是一种先进的视听大语言模型，通过低秩适应（LoRA）和定向偏好优化（DPO）提升视频（带音频）字幕生成能力。提出多轮DPO（MrDPO）方法，显著降低字幕错误率28%，性能超越GPT-4o和Gemini-1.5-Pro。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频包含丰富信息，生成准确的自然语言描述是视频理解的关键。现有方法在字幕生成完整性和准确性上仍有提升空间。

Method: 提出视频-SALMONN 2模型，结合LoRA和DPO优化。引入MrDPO方法，周期性更新参考模型并合并LoRA模块，结合真实字幕指导。

Result: MrDPO显著提升模型性能，字幕错误率降低28%。7B参数的视频-SALMONN 2超越GPT-4o和Gemini-1.5-Pro。

Conclusion: 视频-SALMONN 2在视频字幕生成任务中表现优异，同时在小规模模型中保持竞争力。

Abstract: Videos contain a wealth of information, and generating detailed and accurate
descriptions in natural language is a key aspect of video understanding. In
this paper, we present video-SALMONN 2, an advanced audio-visual large language
model (LLM) with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) designed for enhanced video (with
paired audio) captioning through directed preference optimisation (DPO). We
propose new metrics to evaluate the completeness and accuracy of video
descriptions, which are optimised using DPO. To further improve training, we
propose a novel multi-round DPO (MrDPO) approach, which involves periodically
updating the DPO reference model, merging and re-initialising the LoRA module
as a proxy for parameter updates after each training round (1,000 steps), and
incorporating guidance from ground-truth video captions to stabilise the
process. Experimental results show that MrDPO significantly enhances
video-SALMONN 2's captioning accuracy, reducing the captioning error rates by
28\%. The final video-SALMONN 2 model, with just 7 billion parameters,
surpasses leading models such as GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-Pro in video captioning
tasks, while maintaining highly competitive performance to the state-of-the-art
on widely used video question-answering benchmarks among models of similar
size. Codes are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于结构化指令的迭代优化方法ChartIR，用于提升多模态大语言模型在图表到代码生成任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在图表到代码生成任务中表现不佳，需要同时具备精确的视觉理解和代码翻译能力。

Method: 将任务分解为视觉理解和代码翻译两部分，设计描述和差异两种结构化指令，并将生成流程分为初始代码生成和迭代优化两个阶段。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在开源模型Qwen2-VL和闭源模型GPT-4o上均优于其他方法。

Conclusion: ChartIR通过结构化指令和迭代优化显著提升了图表到代码生成的性能。

Abstract: Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have attracted increasing
research attention due to their powerful visual understanding capabilities.
While they have achieved impressive results on various vision tasks, their
performance on chart-to-code generation remains suboptimal. This task requires
MLLMs to generate executable code that can reproduce a given chart, demanding
not only precise visual understanding but also accurate translation of visual
elements into structured code. Directly prompting MLLMs to perform this complex
task often yields unsatisfactory results. To address this challenge, we propose
{ChartIR}, an iterative refinement method based on structured instruction.
First, we distinguish two tasks: visual understanding and code translation. To
accomplish the visual understanding component, we design two types of
structured instructions: description and difference. The description
instruction captures the visual elements of the reference chart, while the
difference instruction characterizes the discrepancies between the reference
chart and the generated chart. These instructions effectively transform visual
features into language representations, thereby facilitating the subsequent
code translation process. Second, we decompose the overall chart generation
pipeline into two stages: initial code generation and iterative refinement,
enabling progressive enhancement of the final output. Experimental results show
that, compared to other method, our method achieves superior performance on
both the open-source model Qwen2-VL and the closed-source model GPT-4o.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在数据稀缺领域，构建图像分类模型困难，传统方法依赖大量标注数据。ICL为少样本分类提供了新思路，但现有研究忽视了图像嵌入模型的关键作用。

Method: 提出PictSure框架，系统研究视觉编码器类型、预训练目标和微调策略对少样本分类性能的影响。

Result: 实验表明，嵌入模型的预训练方式显著影响训练成功率和跨域性能。PictSure在跨域任务中优于现有方法，同时保持域内任务的可比性能。

Conclusion: PictSure通过优化嵌入模型的设计和训练，为少样本图像分类提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Building image classification models remains cumbersome in data-scarce
domains, where collecting large labeled datasets is impractical. In-context
learning (ICL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for few-shot image
classification (FSIC), enabling models to generalize across domains without
gradient-based adaptation. However, prior work has largely overlooked a
critical component of ICL-based FSIC pipelines: the role of image embeddings.
In this work, we present PictSure, an ICL framework that places the embedding
model -- its architecture, pretraining, and training dynamics -- at the center
of analysis. We systematically examine the effects of different visual encoder
types, pretraining objectives, and fine-tuning strategies on downstream FSIC
performance. Our experiments show that the training success and the
out-of-domain performance are highly dependent on how the embedding models are
pretrained. Consequently, PictSure manages to outperform existing ICL-based
FSIC models on out-of-domain benchmarks that differ significantly from the
training distribution, while maintaining comparable results on in-domain tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于数学和实证的框架BKSEF，用于优化CNN中各层的核大小选择，平衡信息增益、计算效率和准确性。实验表明，该方法在多个数据集上显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 核大小选择在CNN设计中至关重要，但常被忽视。本文旨在通过理论支持和实证验证，优化核大小选择，提升模型效率和准确性。

Method: 提出BKSEF框架，结合信息论、信号处理和学习理论，动态确定各层最优核大小。

Result: 在多个数据集上，BKSEF引导的模型实现了最高3.1%的准确率提升和42.8%的FLOPs减少。实际案例验证了其在医疗图像和交通标志识别中的有效性。

Conclusion: BKSEF证明核大小可作为可优化参数，为高效和任务感知的CNN设计提供了理论和实践支持。

Abstract: Kernel size selection in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is a critical
but often overlooked design decision that affects receptive field, feature
extraction, computational cost, and model accuracy. This paper proposes the
Best Kernel Size Estimation Function (BKSEF), a mathematically grounded and
empirically validated framework for optimal, layer-wise kernel size
determination. BKSEF balances information gain, computational efficiency, and
accuracy improvements by integrating principles from information theory, signal
processing, and learning theory. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
ImageNet-lite, ChestX-ray14, and GTSRB datasets demonstrate that BKSEF-guided
architectures achieve up to 3.1 percent accuracy improvement and 42.8 percent
reduction in FLOPs compared to traditional models using uniform 3x3 kernels.
Two real-world case studies further validate the approach: one for medical
image classification in a cloud-based setup, and another for traffic sign
recognition on edge devices. The former achieved enhanced interpretability and
accuracy, while the latter reduced latency and model size significantly, with
minimal accuracy trade-off. These results show that kernel size can be an
active, optimizable parameter rather than a fixed heuristic. BKSEF provides
practical heuristics and theoretical support for researchers and developers
seeking efficient and application-aware CNN designs. It is suitable for
integration into neural architecture search pipelines and real-time systems,
offering a new perspective on CNN optimization.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习的零售视频自动标注方法，通过关键帧识别和对象检测技术，显著提高了标注效率并降低了成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统零售视频标注依赖耗时的人工标注，成本高且不鲁棒，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 利用深度神经网络学习视频帧的判别特征，结合针对零售环境优化的对象检测技术，实现关键帧自动识别和标注。

Result: 实验表明该方法在标注准确性上媲美人工标注，同时效率提升2倍，仅需人工验证5%的帧。

Conclusion: 该方法显著降低了零售视频标注的时间和成本，适用于多种零售应用场景。

Abstract: Accurate video annotation plays a vital role in modern retail applications,
including customer behavior analysis, product interaction detection, and
in-store activity recognition. However, conventional annotation methods heavily
rely on time-consuming manual labeling by human annotators, introducing
non-robust frame selection and increasing operational costs. To address these
challenges in the retail domain, we propose a deep learning-based approach that
automates key-frame identification in retail videos and provides automatic
annotations of products and customers. Our method leverages deep neural
networks to learn discriminative features by embedding video frames and
incorporating object detection-based techniques tailored for retail
environments. Experimental results showcase the superiority of our approach
over traditional methods, achieving accuracy comparable to human annotator
labeling while enhancing the overall efficiency of retail video annotation.
Remarkably, our approach leads to an average of 2 times cost savings in video
annotation. By allowing human annotators to verify/adjust less than 5% of
detected frames in the video dataset, while automating the annotation process
for the remaining frames without reducing annotation quality, retailers can
significantly reduce operational costs. The automation of key-frame detection
enables substantial time and effort savings in retail video labeling tasks,
proving highly valuable for diverse retail applications such as shopper journey
analysis, product interaction detection, and in-store security monitoring.

*Zhengquan Zhang,Feng Xu,Mengmi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于神经不确定性地图的主动视角选择（AVS）方法，通过轻量级神经网络UPNet预测候选视角的不确定性，从而高效选择信息量最大的视角进行3D重建，显著降低了计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D重建中，不同视角提供的信息量差异显著，如何选择最具价值的视角是一个关键挑战。传统方法依赖计算密集型的不确定性估计，而本文旨在通过直接学习视角外观与不确定性之间的映射关系，实现高效且准确的视角选择。

Method: 提出UPNet，一个轻量级前馈神经网络，输入单张3D物体图像，输出候选视角的不确定性地图。通过观察自然物体及其不确定性模式训练UPNet，并聚合预测的不确定性地图以抑制冗余视角，选择最具信息量的视角。

Result: 使用一半的视角数量即可达到与上限方法相当的3D重建精度，同时显著降低计算开销（400倍加速，CPU、RAM和GPU使用减少50%以上），且无需额外训练即可泛化到新物体类别。

Conclusion: UPNet驱动的AVS方法在3D重建中实现了高效且准确的视角选择，显著提升了计算效率，并展示了良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Some perspectives naturally provide more information than others. How can an
AI system determine which viewpoint offers the most valuable insight for
accurate and efficient 3D object reconstruction? Active view selection (AVS)
for 3D reconstruction remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. The
aim is to identify the minimal set of views that yields the most accurate 3D
reconstruction. Instead of learning radiance fields, like NeRF or 3D Gaussian
Splatting, from a current observation and computing uncertainty for each
candidate viewpoint, we introduce a novel AVS approach guided by neural
uncertainty maps predicted by a lightweight feedforward deep neural network,
named UPNet. UPNet takes a single input image of a 3D object and outputs a
predicted uncertainty map, representing uncertainty values across all possible
candidate viewpoints. By leveraging heuristics derived from observing many
natural objects and their associated uncertainty patterns, we train UPNet to
learn a direct mapping from viewpoint appearance to uncertainty in the
underlying volumetric representations. Next, our approach aggregates all
previously predicted neural uncertainty maps to suppress redundant candidate
viewpoints and effectively select the most informative one. Using these
selected viewpoints, we train 3D neural rendering models and evaluate the
quality of novel view synthesis against other competitive AVS methods.
Remarkably, despite using half of the viewpoints than the upper bound, our
method achieves comparable reconstruction accuracy. In addition, it
significantly reduces computational overhead during AVS, achieving up to a 400
times speedup along with over 50\% reductions in CPU, RAM, and GPU usage
compared to baseline methods. Notably, our approach generalizes effectively to
AVS tasks involving novel object categories, without requiring any additional
training.

Conclusion: DPO-Kernels和DETONATE基准为文本到图像模型的校准提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Alignment is crucial for text-to-image (T2I) models to ensure that generated
images faithfully capture user intent while maintaining safety and fairness.
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), prominent in large language models
(LLMs), is extending its influence to T2I systems. This paper introduces
DPO-Kernels for T2I models, a novel extension enhancing alignment across three
dimensions: (i) Hybrid Loss, integrating embedding-based objectives with
traditional probability-based loss for improved optimization; (ii) Kernelized
Representations, employing Radial Basis Function (RBF), Polynomial, and Wavelet
kernels for richer feature transformations and better separation between safe
and unsafe inputs; and (iii) Divergence Selection, expanding beyond DPO's
default Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularizer by incorporating Wasserstein and
R'enyi divergences for enhanced stability and robustness. We introduce
DETONATE, the first large-scale benchmark of its kind, comprising approximately
100K curated image pairs categorized as chosen and rejected. DETONATE
encapsulates three axes of social bias and discrimination: Race, Gender, and
Disability. Prompts are sourced from hate speech datasets, with images
generated by leading T2I models including Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large, Stable
Diffusion XL, and Midjourney. Additionally, we propose the Alignment Quality
Index (AQI), a novel geometric measure quantifying latent-space separability of
safe/unsafe image activations, revealing hidden vulnerabilities. Empirically,
we demonstrate that DPO-Kernels maintain strong generalization bounds via
Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HT-SR). DETONATE and complete code are
publicly released.

Result: 在5个多图像基准和3个单图像基准上，PeRL显著优于现有方法，达到多图像任务的最优性能。

Conclusion: PeRL在多图像位置推理任务中表现出色，同时保持单图像任务的竞争力。

Abstract: Inspired by the impressive reasoning capabilities demonstrated by
reinforcement learning approaches like DeepSeek-R1, recent emerging research
has begun exploring the use of reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance
vision-language models (VLMs) for multimodal reasoning tasks. However, most
existing multimodal reinforcement learning approaches remain limited to spatial
reasoning within single-image contexts, yet still struggle to generalize to
more complex and real-world scenarios involving multi-image positional
reasoning, where understanding the relationships across images is crucial. To
address this challenge, we propose a general reinforcement learning approach
PeRL tailored for interleaved multimodal tasks, and a multi-stage strategy
designed to enhance the exploration-exploitation trade-off, thereby improving
learning efficiency and task performance. Specifically, we introduce
permutation of image sequences to simulate varied positional relationships to
explore more spatial and positional diversity. Furthermore, we design a rollout
filtering mechanism for resampling to focus on trajectories that contribute
most to learning optimal behaviors to exploit learned policies effectively. We
evaluate our model on 5 widely-used multi-image benchmarks and 3 single-image
benchmarks. Our experiments confirm that PeRL trained model consistently
surpasses R1-related and interleaved VLM baselines by a large margin, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on multi-image benchmarks, while preserving
comparable performance on single-image tasks.

Motivation: 扩散模型在医学图像等敏感领域的应用引发隐私问题，现有MIA方法因图像固有难度和扩散模型在高频细节重建上的不足而受限。

Method: 通过分析反向扩散过程，计算中频范围的重建误差，并结合结构相似性指数评分来确定成员资格。

Result: 在多个医学图像数据集上的实验表明，FCRE方法优于现有MIA方法。

Conclusion: FCRE方法有效解决了医学图像MIA中的挑战，为隐私风险评估提供了更可靠的量化工具。

Abstract: The increasing use of diffusion models for image generation, especially in
sensitive areas like medical imaging, has raised significant privacy concerns.
Membership Inference Attack (MIA) has emerged as a potential approach to
determine if a specific image was used to train a diffusion model, thus
quantifying privacy risks. Existing MIA methods often rely on diffusion
reconstruction errors, where member images are expected to have lower
reconstruction errors than non-member images. However, applying these methods
directly to medical images faces challenges. Reconstruction error is influenced
by inherent image difficulty, and diffusion models struggle with high-frequency
detail reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose a
Frequency-Calibrated Reconstruction Error (FCRE) method for MIAs on medical
image diffusion models. By focusing on reconstruction errors within a specific
mid-frequency range and excluding both high-frequency (difficult to
reconstruct) and low-frequency (less informative) regions, our
frequency-selective approach mitigates the confounding factor of inherent image
difficulty. Specifically, we analyze the reverse diffusion process, obtain the
mid-frequency reconstruction error, and compute the structural similarity index
score between the reconstructed and original images. Membership is determined
by comparing this score to a threshold. Experiments on several medical image
datasets demonstrate that our FCRE method outperforms existing MIA methods.

Conclusion: 本文为ViT在喷注分类中的应用提供了系统框架和性能基准，同时提供了结构化数据集，推动了该领域的深度学习研究。

Abstract: Distinguishing between quark- and gluon-initiated jets is a critical and
challenging task in high-energy physics, pivotal for improving new physics
searches and precision measurements at the Large Hadron Collider. While deep
learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), has advanced jet
tagging using image-based representations, the potential of Vision Transformer
(ViT) architectures, renowned for modeling global contextual information,
remains largely underexplored for direct calorimeter image analysis, especially
under realistic detector and pileup conditions. This paper presents a
systematic evaluation of ViTs and ViT-CNN hybrid models for quark-gluon jet
classification using simulated 2012 CMS Open Data. We construct multi-channel
jet-view images from detector-level energy deposits (ECAL, HCAL) and
reconstructed tracks, enabling an end-to-end learning approach. Our
comprehensive benchmarking demonstrates that ViT-based models, notably
ViT+MaxViT and ViT+ConvNeXt hybrids, consistently outperform established CNN
baselines in F1-score, ROC-AUC, and accuracy, highlighting the advantage of
capturing long-range spatial correlations within jet substructure. This work
establishes the first systematic framework and robust performance baselines for
applying ViT architectures to calorimeter image-based jet classification using
public collider data, alongside a structured dataset suitable for further deep
learning research in this domain.

Abstract: Compliance is a critical parameter for describing objects in engineering,
agriculture, and biomedical applications. Traditional compliance detection
methods are limited by their lack of portability and scalability, rely on
specialized, often expensive equipment, and are unsuitable for robotic
applications. Moreover, existing neural network-based approaches using
vision-based tactile sensors still suffer from insufficient prediction
accuracy. In this paper, we propose two models based on Long-term Recurrent
Convolutional Networks (LRCNs) and Transformer architectures that leverage RGB
tactile images and other information captured by the vision-based sensor
GelSight to predict compliance metrics accurately. We validate the performance
of these models using multiple metrics and demonstrate their effectiveness in
accurately estimating compliance. The proposed models exhibit significant
performance improvement over the baseline. Additionally, we investigated the
correlation between sensor compliance and object compliance estimation, which
revealed that objects that are harder than the sensor are more challenging to
estimate.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史地图中的文本提供了丰富的地理、历史和文化信息，但提取困难，缺乏有效方法和训练数据。

Method: 提出PALETTE，结合超局部采样模块和位置嵌入，优化文本边界点和字符的检测与识别；并开发SynthMap+自动生成合成数据用于训练。

Result: PALETTE在历史地图文本识别任务上优于现有方法，特别是在长文本和倾斜文本上，已成功应用于6万张地图处理。

Conclusion: PALETTE和SynthMap+为历史地图文本提取提供了高效解决方案，支持大规模地图搜索应用。

Abstract: Text on historical maps contains valuable information providing georeferenced
historical, political, and cultural contexts. However, text extraction from
historical maps is challenging due to the lack of (1) effective methods and (2)
training data. Previous approaches use ad-hoc steps tailored to only specific
map styles. Recent machine learning-based text spotters (e.g., for scene
images) have the potential to solve these challenges because of their
flexibility in supporting various types of text instances. However, these
methods remain challenges in extracting precise image features for predicting
every sub-component (boundary points and characters) in a text instance. This
is critical because map text can be lengthy and highly rotated with complex
backgrounds, posing difficulties in detecting relevant image features from a
rough text region. This paper proposes PALETTE, an end-to-end text spotter for
scanned historical maps of a wide variety. PALETTE introduces a novel
hyper-local sampling module to explicitly learn localized image features around
the target boundary points and characters of a text instance for detection and
recognition. PALETTE also enables hyper-local positional embeddings to learn
spatial interactions between boundary points and characters within and across
text instances. In addition, this paper presents a novel approach to
automatically generate synthetic map images, SynthMap+, for training text
spotters for historical maps. The experiment shows that PALETTE with SynthMap+
outperforms SOTA text spotters on two new benchmark datasets of historical
maps, particularly for long and angled text. We have deployed PALETTE with
SynthMap+ to process over 60,000 maps in the David Rumsey Historical Map
collection and generated over 100 million text labels to support map searching.

TL;DR: StyleWallfacer是一个统一的训练和推理框架，解决了传统风格迁移方法的问题，支持艺术级风格迁移和文本驱动风格化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统风格迁移方法存在多种问题，且不同任务的框架不统一。StyleWallfacer旨在通过统一的框架实现高效、无漂移的风格注入和文本控制。

Method: 1. 基于BLIP和CLIP空间的语义风格注入方法；2. 基于人类反馈的数据增强策略；3. 无训练的三重扩散过程，利用自注意力层特征。

Result: 实现了高质量的图像驱动风格迁移和文本驱动风格化，首次在风格迁移中实现图像颜色编辑。

Conclusion: StyleWallfacer框架在风格迁移领域取得了突破性进展，为艺术级风格迁移和文本控制提供了新思路。

Abstract: In this pioneering study, we introduce StyleWallfacer, a groundbreaking
unified training and inference framework, which not only addresses various
issues encountered in the style transfer process of traditional methods but
also unifies the framework for different tasks. This framework is designed to
revolutionize the field by enabling artist level style transfer and text driven
stylization. First, we propose a semantic-based style injection method that
uses BLIP to generate text descriptions strictly aligned with the semantics of
the style image in CLIP space. By leveraging a large language model to remove
style-related descriptions from these descriptions, we create a semantic gap.
This gap is then used to fine-tune the model, enabling efficient and drift-free
injection of style knowledge. Second, we propose a data augmentation strategy
based on human feedback, incorporating high-quality samples generated early in
the fine-tuning process into the training set to facilitate progressive
learning and significantly reduce its overfitting. Finally, we design a
training-free triple diffusion process using the fine-tuned model, which
manipulates the features of self-attention layers in a manner similar to the
cross-attention mechanism. Specifically, in the generation process, the key and
value of the content-related process are replaced with those of the
style-related process to inject style while maintaining text control over the
model. We also introduce query preservation to mitigate disruptions to the
original content. Under such a design, we have achieved high-quality
image-driven style transfer and text-driven stylization, delivering
artist-level style transfer results while preserving the original image
content. Moreover, we achieve image color editing during the style transfer
process for the first time.

Result: 实验和理论分析验证了方法的有效性，实现了近100%的码书利用率和显著降低的量化误差。

Conclusion: 通过Wasserstein距离对齐分布，有效解决了向量量化中的关键问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: The success of autoregressive models largely depends on the effectiveness of
vector quantization, a technique that discretizes continuous features by
mapping them to the nearest code vectors within a learnable codebook. Two
critical issues in existing vector quantization methods are training
instability and codebook collapse. Training instability arises from the
gradient discrepancy introduced by the straight-through estimator, especially
in the presence of significant quantization errors, while codebook collapse
occurs when only a small subset of code vectors are utilized during training. A
closer examination of these issues reveals that they are primarily driven by a
mismatch between the distributions of the features and code vectors, leading to
unrepresentative code vectors and significant data information loss during
compression. To address this, we employ the Wasserstein distance to align these
two distributions, achieving near 100\% codebook utilization and significantly
reducing the quantization error. Both empirical and theoretical analyses
validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Conclusion: SynPo通过优化负提示质量，显著提升了无训练少样本医学图像分割的效果。

Abstract: The advent of Large Vision Models (LVMs) offers new opportunities for
few-shot medical image segmentation. However, existing training-free methods
based on LVMs fail to effectively utilize negative prompts, leading to poor
performance on low-contrast medical images. To address this issue, we propose
SynPo, a training-free few-shot method based on LVMs (e.g., SAM), with the core
insight: improving the quality of negative prompts. To select point prompts in
a more reliable confidence map, we design a novel Confidence Map Synergy Module
by combining the strengths of DINOv2 and SAM. Based on the confidence map, we
select the top-k pixels as the positive points set and choose the negative
points set using a Gaussian distribution, followed by independent K-means
clustering for both sets. Then, these selected points are leveraged as
high-quality prompts for SAM to get the segmentation results. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that SynPo achieves performance comparable to
state-of-the-art training-based few-shot methods.

Conclusion: PDSA模块有效解决了现有问题，实验和可视化结果证明了其合理性和有效性。

Abstract: Point cloud analysis is the cornerstone of many downstream tasks, among which
aggregating local structures is the basis for understanding point cloud data.
While numerous works aggregate neighbor using three-dimensional relative
coordinates, there are irrelevant point interference and feature hierarchy gap
problems due to the limitation of local coordinates. Although some works
address this limitation by refining spatial description though explicit
modeling of cross-stage structure, these enhancement methods based on direct
geometric structure encoding have problems of high computational overhead and
noise sensitivity. To overcome these problems, we propose the Point
Distribution Set Abstraction module (PDSA) that utilizes the correlation in the
high-dimensional space to correct the feature distribution during aggregation,
which improves the computational efficiency and robustness. PDSA distinguishes
the point correlation based on a lightweight cross-stage structural descriptor,
and enhances structural homogeneity by reducing the variance of the neighbor
feature matrix and increasing classes separability though long-distance
modeling. Additionally, we introducing a key point mechanism to optimize the
computational overhead. The experimental result on semantic segmentation and
classification tasks based on different baselines verify the generalization of
the method we proposed, and achieve significant performance improvement with
less parameter cost. The corresponding ablation and visualization results
demonstrate the effectiveness and rationality of our method. The code and

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have
revolutionized image processing, demonstrating significant potential in medical
applications. Accurate segmentation of the left ventricle (LV) in
echocardiograms is crucial for diagnostic procedures and necessary treatments.
However, ultrasound images are notoriously noisy with low contrast and
ambiguous LV boundaries, thereby complicating the segmentation process. To
address these challenges, this paper introduces Echo-DND, a novel dual-noise
diffusion model specifically designed for this task. Echo-DND leverages a
unique combination of Gaussian and Bernoulli noises. It also incorporates a
multi-scale fusion conditioning module to improve segmentation precision.
Furthermore, it utilizes spatial coherence calibration to maintain spatial
integrity in segmentation masks. The model's performance was rigorously
validated on the CAMUS and EchoNet-Dynamic datasets. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing SOTA models. It
achieves high Dice scores of 0.962 and 0.939 on these datasets, respectively.
The proposed Echo-DND model establishes a new standard in echocardiogram
segmentation, and its architecture holds promise for broader applicability in
other medical imaging tasks, potentially improving diagnostic accuracy across
various medical domains. Project page: https://abdur75648.github.io/Echo-DND

Method: 提出ReSeDis任务，结合检索与定位，设计新基准和评估指标，并提供零样本基线。

Result: ReSeDis为构建稳健的多模态搜索系统提供了新方向，展示了未来研究的潜力。

Conclusion: ReSeDis是下一代多模态搜索系统的现实测试平台，具有重要研究价值。

Abstract: Large-scale visual search engines are expected to solve a dual problem at
once: (i) locate every image that truly contains the object described by a
sentence and (ii) identify the object's bounding box or exact pixels within
each hit. Existing techniques address only one side of this challenge. Visual
grounding yields tight boxes and masks but rests on the unrealistic assumption
that the object is present in every test image, producing a flood of false
alarms when applied to web-scale collections. Text-to-image retrieval excels at
sifting through massive databases to rank relevant images, yet it stops at
whole-image matches and offers no fine-grained localization. We introduce
Referring Search and Discovery (ReSeDis), the first task that unifies
corpus-level retrieval with pixel-level grounding. Given a free-form
description, a ReSeDis model must decide whether the queried object appears in
each image and, if so, where it is, returning bounding boxes or segmentation
masks. To enable rigorous study, we curate a benchmark in which every
description maps uniquely to object instances scattered across a large, diverse
corpus, eliminating unintended matches. We further design a task-specific
metric that jointly scores retrieval recall and localization precision.
Finally, we provide a straightforward zero-shot baseline using a frozen
vision-language model, revealing significant headroom for future study. ReSeDis
offers a realistic, end-to-end testbed for building the next generation of
robust and scalable multimodal search systems.

Abstract: Recent advancements in medical image analysis have led to the development of
highly specialized models tailored to specific clinical tasks. These models
have demonstrated exceptional performance and remain a crucial research
direction. Yet, their applicability is limited to predefined tasks, requiring
expertise and extensive resources for development and adaptation. In contrast,
generalist models offer a different form of utility: allowing medical
practitioners to define tasks on the fly without the need for task-specific
model development. In this work, we explore how to train generalist models for
the domain of retinal optical coherence tomography using visual in-context
learning (VICL), i.e., training models to generalize across tasks based on a
few examples provided at inference time. To facilitate rigorous assessment, we
propose a broad evaluation protocol tailored to VICL in OCT. We extensively
evaluate a state-of-the-art medical VICL approach on multiple retinal OCT
datasets, establishing a first baseline to highlight the potential and current
limitations of in-context learning for OCT. To foster further research and
practical adoption, we openly release our code.

Result: 实验证明PSIC在多种下游任务中有效保护隐私并保持图像质量。

Conclusion: PSIC是一种即插即用的隐私保护图像压缩方案，可集成到现有LIC模型中。

Abstract: The improved semantic understanding of vision-language pretrained (VLP)
models has made it increasingly difficult to protect publicly posted images
from being exploited by search engines and other similar tools. In this
context, this paper seeks to protect users' privacy by implementing defenses at
the image compression stage to prevent exploitation. Specifically, we propose a
flexible coding method, termed Privacy-Shielded Image Compression (PSIC), that
can produce bitstreams with multiple decoding options. By default, the
bitstream is decoded to preserve satisfactory perceptual quality while
preventing interpretation by VLP models. Our method also retains the original
image compression functionality. With a customizable input condition, the
proposed scheme can reconstruct the image that preserves its full semantic
information. A Conditional Latent Trigger Generation (CLTG) module is proposed
to produce bias information based on customizable conditions to guide the
decoding process into different reconstructed versions, and an
Uncertainty-Aware Encryption-Oriented (UAEO) optimization function is designed
to leverage the soft labels inferred from the target VLP model's uncertainty on
the training data. This paper further incorporates an adaptive multi-objective
optimization strategy to obtain improved encrypting performance and perceptual
quality simultaneously within a unified training process. The proposed scheme
is plug-and-play and can be seamlessly integrated into most existing Learned
Image Compression (LIC) models. Extensive experiments across multiple
downstream tasks have demonstrated the effectiveness of our design.

Abstract: Multimodal medical image fusion (MMIF) extracts the most meaningful
information from multiple source images, enabling a more comprehensive and
accurate diagnosis. Achieving high-quality fusion results requires a careful
balance of brightness, color, contrast, and detail; this ensures that the fused
images effectively display relevant anatomical structures and reflect the
functional status of the tissues. However, existing MMIF methods have limited
capacity to capture detailed features during conventional training and suffer
from insufficient cross-modal feature interaction, leading to suboptimal fused
image quality. To address these issues, this study proposes a two-stage
diffusion model-based fusion network (DM-FNet) to achieve unified MMIF. In
Stage I, a diffusion process trains UNet for image reconstruction. UNet
captures detailed information through progressive denoising and represents
multilevel data, providing a rich set of feature representations for the
subsequent fusion network. In Stage II, noisy images at various steps are input
into the fusion network to enhance the model's feature recognition capability.
Three key fusion modules are also integrated to process medical images from
different modalities adaptively. Ultimately, the robust network structure and a
hybrid loss function are integrated to harmonize the fused image's brightness,
color, contrast, and detail, enhancing its quality and information density. The
experimental results across various medical image types demonstrate that the
proposed method performs exceptionally well regarding objective evaluation
metrics. The fused image preserves appropriate brightness, a comprehensive
distribution of radioactive tracers, rich textures, and clear edges. The code
is available at https://github.com/HeDan-11/DM-FNet.

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) enables submeter-resolution imaging and
all-weather monitoring via active microwave and advanced signal processing.
Currently, SAR has found extensive applications in critical maritime domains
such as ship detection. However, SAR ship detection faces several challenges,
including significant scale variations among ships, the presence of small
offshore vessels mixed with noise, and complex backgrounds for large nearshore
ships. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel feature enhancement
and fusion framework named C-AFBiFPN. C-AFBiFPN constructs a Convolutional
Feature Enhancement (CFE) module following the backbone network, aiming to
enrich feature representation and enhance the ability to capture and represent
local details and contextual information. Furthermore, C-AFBiFPN innovatively
integrates BiFormer attention within the fusion strategy of BiFPN, creating the
AFBiFPN network. AFBiFPN improves the global modeling capability of cross-scale
feature fusion and can adaptively focus on critical feature regions. The
experimental results on SAR Ship Detection Dataset (SSDD) indicate that the
proposed approach substantially enhances detection accuracy for small targets,
robustness against occlusions, and adaptability to multi-scale features.

Result: 在Tanks&Temple和NeRFBuster数据集上，RA-NeRF在位姿估计和视觉质量上均达到SOTA。

Conclusion: RA-NeRF在复杂相机轨迹下表现出色，验证了其有效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have emerged
as powerful tools for 3D reconstruction and SLAM tasks. However, their
performance depends heavily on accurate camera pose priors. Existing approaches
attempt to address this issue by introducing external constraints but fall
short of achieving satisfactory accuracy, particularly when camera trajectories
are complex. In this paper, we propose a novel method, RA-NeRF, capable of
predicting highly accurate camera poses even with complex camera trajectories.
Following the incremental pipeline, RA-NeRF reconstructs the scene using NeRF
with photometric consistency and incorporates flow-driven pose regulation to
enhance robustness during initialization and localization. Additionally,
RA-NeRF employs an implicit pose filter to capture the camera movement pattern
and eliminate the noise for pose estimation. To validate our method, we conduct
extensive experiments on the Tanks\&Temple dataset for standard evaluation, as
well as the NeRFBuster dataset, which presents challenging camera pose
trajectories. On both datasets, RA-NeRF achieves state-of-the-art results in
both camera pose estimation and visual quality, demonstrating its effectiveness
and robustness in scene reconstruction under complex pose trajectories.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏历史上下文获取机制，限制了在复杂伪装场景中的适应性和效果。

Result: 在多个数据集上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RetroMem通过动态记忆机制和推理模式重构，有效提升了伪装场景的理解能力。

Abstract: Camouflaged object detection (COD) primarily focuses on learning subtle yet
discriminative representations from complex scenes. Existing methods
predominantly follow the parametric feedforward architecture based on static
visual representation modeling. However, they lack explicit mechanisms for
acquiring historical context, limiting their adaptation and effectiveness in
handling challenging camouflage scenes. In this paper, we propose a
recall-augmented COD architecture, namely RetroMem, which dynamically modulates
camouflage pattern perception and inference by integrating relevant historical
knowledge into the process. Specifically, RetroMem employs a two-stage training
paradigm consisting of a learning stage and a recall stage to construct,
update, and utilize memory representations effectively. During the learning
stage, we design a dense multi-scale adapter (DMA) to improve the pretrained
encoder's capability to capture rich multi-scale visual information with very
few trainable parameters, thereby providing foundational inferences. In the
recall stage, we propose a dynamic memory mechanism (DMM) and an inference
pattern reconstruction (IPR). These components fully leverage the latent
relationships between learned knowledge and current sample context to
reconstruct the inference of camouflage patterns, thereby significantly
improving the model's understanding of camouflage scenes. Extensive experiments
on several widely used datasets demonstrate that our RetroMem significantly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

remarkable success. In particular, Domain Adaptation (DA) has proven highly
effective since it focuses on using the knowledge learned on a (source) domain
to adapt and perform effectively on a different but related (target) domain. By
improving robustness and scalability, DA minimizes the need for extensive
manual re-labeling or re-training of models. This not only reduces
computational and resource costs but also allows human experts to focus on
high-value tasks. Therefore, we tested the efficacy of DA techniques in
semi-supervised and unsupervised settings within the context of the
semiconductor field. Moreover, we propose the DBACS approach, a
CycleGAN-inspired model enhanced with additional loss terms to improve
performance. All the approaches are studied and validated on real-world
Electron Microscope images considering the unsupervised and semi-supervised
settings, proving the usefulness of our method in advancing DA techniques for
the semiconductor field.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BCRNet是一种基于Bezier曲线优化的新型框架，显著提升了腹腔镜肝脏手术中关键解剖标志的检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 腹腔镜手术中准确识别解剖结构具有挑战性，AR系统通过2D-3D配准提供解决方案，但需要精确的曲线标志检测。

Method: 提出BCRNet框架，包括多模态特征提取（MFE）、自适应曲线提案初始化（ACPI）和分层曲线优化（HCR）机制。

Result: 在L3D和P2ILF数据集上表现优于现有方法，性能显著提升。

Conclusion: BCRNet通过Bezier曲线优化策略，有效提升了腹腔镜手术中的标志检测精度。

Abstract: Laparoscopic liver surgery, while minimally invasive, poses significant
challenges in accurately identifying critical anatomical structures. Augmented
reality (AR) systems, integrating MRI/CT with laparoscopic images based on
2D-3D registration, offer a promising solution for enhancing surgical
navigation. A vital aspect of the registration progress is the precise
detection of curvilinear anatomical landmarks in laparoscopic images. In this
paper, we propose BCRNet (Bezier Curve Refinement Net), a novel framework that
significantly enhances landmark detection in laparoscopic liver surgery
primarily via the Bezier curve refinement strategy. The framework starts with a
Multi-modal Feature Extraction (MFE) module designed to robustly capture
semantic features. Then we propose Adaptive Curve Proposal Initialization
(ACPI) to generate pixel-aligned Bezier curves and confidence scores for
reliable initial proposals. Additionally, we design the Hierarchical Curve
Refinement (HCR) mechanism to enhance these proposals iteratively through a
multi-stage process, capturing fine-grained contextual details from multi-scale
pixel-level features for precise Bezier curve adjustment. Extensive evaluations
on the L3D and P2ILF datasets demonstrate that BCRNet outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant performance improvements. Code

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RaCalNet提出了一种无需密集监督的毫米波雷达深度估计框架，通过稀疏LiDAR监督实现高精度深度预测，显著降低数据需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖密集LiDAR监督，成本高且数据密集，RaCalNet旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过稀疏雷达点校准构建深度先验，引导单目深度预测，避免密集监督。

Result: 在ZJU-4DRadarCam数据集上，RMSE降低35.30%和34.89%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RaCalNet证明了稀疏监督的可行性，显著提升深度估计效果。

Abstract: Dense metric depth estimation using millimeter-wave radar typically requires
dense LiDAR supervision, generated via multi-frame projection and
interpolation, to guide the learning of accurate depth from sparse radar
measurements and RGB images. However, this paradigm is both costly and
data-intensive. To address this, we propose RaCalNet, a novel framework that
eliminates the need for dense supervision by using sparse LiDAR to supervise
the learning of refined radar measurements, resulting in a supervision density
of merely around 1% compared to dense-supervised methods. Unlike previous
approaches that associate radar points with broad image regions and rely
heavily on dense labels, RaCalNet first recalibrates and refines sparse radar
points to construct accurate depth priors. These priors then serve as reliable
anchors to guide monocular depth prediction, enabling metric-scale estimation
without resorting to dense supervision. This design improves structural
consistency and preserves fine details. Despite relying solely on sparse
supervision, RaCalNet surpasses state-of-the-art dense-supervised methods,
producing depth maps with clear object contours and fine-grained textures.
Extensive experiments on the ZJU-4DRadarCam dataset and real-world deployment
scenarios demonstrate its effectiveness, reducing RMSE by 35.30% and 34.89%,
respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业装配任务的视觉监控对防止设备损坏和确保工人安全至关重要，现有方案通常需要固定设置或标记。

Result: 在LEGO组件更换和液压模具重配置任务中验证了ViMAT的有效性，支持部分和不确定的视觉观察。

Conclusion: ViMAT在复杂现实场景中表现出色，无需传统约束。

Abstract: Visual monitoring of industrial assembly tasks is critical for preventing
equipment damage due to procedural errors and ensuring worker safety. Although
commercial solutions exist, they typically require rigid workspace setups or
the application of visual markers to simplify the problem. We introduce ViMAT,
a novel AI-driven system for real-time visual monitoring of assembly tasks that
operates without these constraints. ViMAT combines a perception module that
extracts visual observations from multi-view video streams with a reasoning
module that infers the most likely action being performed based on the observed
assembly state and prior task knowledge. We validate ViMAT on two assembly
tasks, involving the replacement of LEGO components and the reconfiguration of
hydraulic press molds, demonstrating its effectiveness through quantitative and
qualitative analysis in challenging real-world scenarios characterized by
partial and uncertain visual observations. Project page:

Result: 提出了基线模型，结合了先进视觉语言模型和导航策略，展示了性能评估和改进方向。

Conclusion: 新基准为具身任务中的长期记忆和推理能力提供了可扩展的评估框架。

Abstract: Large vision-language models have recently demonstrated impressive
performance in planning and control tasks, driving interest in their
application to real-world robotics. However, deploying these models for
reasoning in embodied contexts is limited by their ability to incorporate
long-term experience collected across multiple days and represented by vast
collections of images. Current VLMs typically struggle to process more than a
few hundred images concurrently, highlighting the need for more efficient
mechanisms to handle long-term memory in embodied settings. To effectively
evaluate these models for long-horizon control, a benchmark must specifically
target scenarios where memory is crucial for success. Existing long-video QA
benchmarks overlook embodied challenges like object manipulation and
navigation, which demand low-level skills and fine-grained reasoning over past
interactions. Moreover, effective memory integration in embodied agents
involves both recalling relevant historical information and executing actions
based on that information, making it essential to study these aspects together
rather than in isolation. In this work, we introduce a new benchmark for
long-range embodied tasks in the Habitat simulator. This benchmark evaluates
memory-based capabilities across 60 tasks requiring sustained engagement and
contextual awareness in an environment. The tasks can also be procedurally
extended to longer and more challenging versions, enabling scalable evaluation
of memory and reasoning. We also present baselines that integrate
state-of-the-art VLMs with low level navigation policies, assessing their
performance on these memory-intensive tasks and highlight areas for
improvement.

decision-making. This paper introduces an enhanced End-to-End model named MapFM
for online vectorized HD map generation. We show significantly boost feature
representation quality by incorporating powerful foundation model for encoding
camera images. To further enrich the model's understanding of the environment
and improve prediction quality, we integrate auxiliary prediction heads for
semantic segmentation in the BEV representation. This multi-task learning
approach provides richer contextual supervision, leading to a more

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统主动学习方法在开集场景（存在大量OOD数据）下效率低的问题，以及初始随机选择导致的标注浪费。

Method: 结合任务特定提示词选择ID样本，后续采用DIS方法（PIS和EGSS）确保样本纯度和信息量。

Result: 在两个公开病理数据集上表现优于现有开集AL方法，显著提升模型性能。

Conclusion: OpenPath通过高纯度样本选择和高效标注策略，为病理图像分类提供了一种实用解决方案。

Abstract: Pathology image classification plays a crucial role in accurate medical
diagnosis and treatment planning. Training high-performance models for this
task typically requires large-scale annotated datasets, which are both
expensive and time-consuming to acquire. Active Learning (AL) offers a solution
by iteratively selecting the most informative samples for annotation, thereby
reducing the labeling effort. However, most AL methods are designed under the
assumption of a closed-set scenario, where all the unannotated images belong to
target classes. In real-world clinical environments, the unlabeled pool often
contains a substantial amount of Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data, leading to low
efficiency of annotation in traditional AL methods. Furthermore, most existing
AL methods start with random selection in the first query round, leading to a
significant waste of labeling costs in open-set scenarios. To address these
challenges, we propose OpenPath, a novel open-set active learning approach for
pathological image classification leveraging a pre-trained Vision-Language
Model (VLM). In the first query, we propose task-specific prompts that combine
target and relevant non-target class prompts to effectively select
In-Distribution (ID) and informative samples from the unlabeled pool. In
subsequent queries, Diverse Informative ID Sampling (DIS) that includes
Prototype-based ID candidate Selection (PIS) and Entropy-Guided Stochastic
Sampling (EGSS) is proposed to ensure both purity and informativeness in a
query, avoiding the selection of OOD samples. Experiments on two public
pathology image datasets show that OpenPath significantly enhances the model's
performance due to its high purity of selected samples, and outperforms several
state-of-the-art open-set AL methods. The code is available at

Result: CountVid在VideoCount数据集上表现优异，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: CountVid模型和VideoCount数据集为开放世界视频对象计数提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce a new task of open-world object counting in videos: given a text
description, or an image example, that specifies the target object, the
objective is to enumerate all the unique instances of the target objects in the
video. This task is especially challenging in crowded scenes with occlusions
and similar objects, where avoiding double counting and identifying
reappearances is crucial. To this end, we make the following contributions: we
introduce a model, CountVid, for this task. It leverages an image-based
counting model, and a promptable video segmentation and tracking model to
enable automated, open-world object counting across video frames. To evaluate
its performance, we introduce VideoCount, a new dataset for our novel task
built from the TAO and MOT20 tracking datasets, as well as from videos of
penguins and metal alloy crystallization captured by x-rays. Using this
dataset, we demonstrate that CountVid provides accurate object counts, and
significantly outperforms strong baselines. The VideoCount dataset, the
CountVid model, and all the code are available at

Motivation: 现有方法难以处理动物皮毛或皮肤图案的形变，因身体运动和姿势变化导致几何失真。

Method: 使用表面法线估计指导纹理展开，保持3D表面与2D纹理空间的几何一致性，无需真实UV标注，可自监督训练。

Result: 在Saimaa环斑海豹和豹子数据集上，重识别准确率提升达5.4%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过几何感知的纹理映射，显著提升了对形变动物图案的个体重识别性能。

Abstract: Existing individual re-identification methods often struggle with the
deformable nature of animal fur or skin patterns which undergo geometric
distortions due to body movement and posture changes. In this paper, we propose
a geometry-aware texture mapping approach that unwarps pelage patterns, the
unique markings found on an animal's skin or fur, into a canonical UV space,
enabling more robust feature matching. Our method uses surface normal
estimation to guide the unwrapping process while preserving the geometric
consistency between the 3D surface and the 2D texture space. We focus on two
challenging species: Saimaa ringed seals (Pusa hispida saimensis) and leopards
(Panthera pardus). Both species have distinctive yet highly deformable fur
patterns. By integrating our pattern-preserving UV mapping with existing
re-identification techniques, we demonstrate improved accuracy across diverse
poses and viewing angles. Our framework does not require ground truth UV
annotations and can be trained in a self-supervised manner. Experiments on seal
and leopard datasets show up to a 5.4% improvement in re-identification
accuracy.

TL;DR: DDIS是一种新的数据无关图像合成方法，利用扩散模型作为先验知识，生成更接近训练数据分布的图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源预训练模型在训练数据不可用时效用下降，现有DFIS方法生成的图像偏离训练数据分布。

Method: 提出DDIS方法，结合扩散模型和领域对齐指导（DAG），优化类别对齐标记（CAT）嵌入。

Result: 在PACS和ImageNet上实验显示，DDIS优于现有DFIS方法，生成更符合训练数据分布的图像。

Conclusion: DDIS通过扩散模型和领域对齐指导，显著提升了数据无关图像合成的质量。

Abstract: Open-source pre-trained models hold great potential for diverse applications,
but their utility declines when their training data is unavailable. Data-Free
Image Synthesis (DFIS) aims to generate images that approximate the learned
data distribution of a pre-trained model without accessing the original data.
However, existing DFIS meth ods produce samples that deviate from the training
data distribution due to the lack of prior knowl edge about natural images. To
overcome this limitation, we propose DDIS, the first Diffusion-assisted
Data-free Image Synthesis method that leverages a text-to-image diffusion model
as a powerful image prior, improving synthetic image quality. DDIS extracts
knowledge about the learned distribution from the given model and uses it to
guide the diffusion model, enabling the generation of images that accurately
align with the training data distribution. To achieve this, we introduce Domain
Alignment Guidance (DAG) that aligns the synthetic data domain with the
training data domain during the diffusion sampling process. Furthermore, we
optimize a single Class Alignment Token (CAT) embedding to effectively capture
class-specific attributes in the training dataset. Experiments on PACS and Ima
geNet demonstrate that DDIS outperforms prior DFIS methods by generating
samples that better reflect the training data distribution, achieving SOTA
performance in data-free applications.

Motivation: 在医学影像领域，确保深度学习模型的可靠性至关重要，尤其是识别OOD样本以发现潜在异常。现有方法可能无法完全捕捉OOD多样性。

Result: 在胃肠道影像基准测试Kvasir和GastroVision上，NERO优于现有OOD检测方法。

Conclusion: NERO通过神经元级相关性和可解释性设计，显著提升了医学影像中OOD检测的可靠性和性能。

Abstract: Ensuring reliability is paramount in deep learning, particularly within the
domain of medical imaging, where diagnostic decisions often hinge on model
outputs. The capacity to separate out-of-distribution (OOD) samples has proven
to be a valuable indicator of a model's reliability in research. In medical
imaging, this is especially critical, as identifying OOD inputs can help flag
potential anomalies that might otherwise go undetected. While many OOD
detection methods rely on feature or logit space representations, recent works
suggest these approaches may not fully capture OOD diversity. To address this,
we propose a novel OOD scoring mechanism, called NERO, that leverages
neuron-level relevance at the feature layer. Specifically, we cluster
neuron-level relevance for each in-distribution (ID) class to form
representative centroids and introduce a relevance distance metric to quantify
a new sample's deviation from these centroids, enhancing OOD separability.
Additionally, we refine performance by incorporating scaled relevance in the
bias term and combining feature norms. Our framework also enables explainable
OOD detection. We validate its effectiveness across multiple deep learning
architectures on the gastrointestinal imaging benchmarks Kvasir and
GastroVision, achieving improvements over state-of-the-art OOD detection
methods.

Motivation: 由于缺乏大规模4D HOI数据集，现有方法难以实现高质量的4D HOI合成。

Method: 第一阶段使用Object-AnchorNet从3D HOI数据集中重建稀疏3D HOI关键帧；第二阶段引入ContactDM，通过接触感知机制插值生成密集4D HOI序列。

Result: 在OMOMO和3D-FUTURE数据集上取得最优结果，展示了强大的泛化能力和高保真生成能力。

Conclusion: GenHOI通过两阶段设计和接触感知机制，有效解决了4D HOI合成的挑战。

Abstract: While diffusion models and large-scale motion datasets have advanced
text-driven human motion synthesis, extending these advances to 4D human-object
interaction (HOI) remains challenging, mainly due to the limited availability
of large-scale 4D HOI datasets. In our study, we introduce GenHOI, a novel
two-stage framework aimed at achieving two key objectives: 1) generalization to
unseen objects and 2) the synthesis of high-fidelity 4D HOI sequences. In the
initial stage of our framework, we employ an Object-AnchorNet to reconstruct
sparse 3D HOI keyframes for unseen objects, learning solely from 3D HOI
datasets, thereby mitigating the dependence on large-scale 4D HOI datasets.
Subsequently, we introduce a Contact-Aware Diffusion Model (ContactDM) in the
second stage to seamlessly interpolate sparse 3D HOI keyframes into densely
temporally coherent 4D HOI sequences. To enhance the quality of generated 4D
HOI sequences, we propose a novel Contact-Aware Encoder within ContactDM to
extract human-object contact patterns and a novel Contact-Aware HOI Attention
to effectively integrate the contact signals into diffusion models.
Experimental results show that we achieve state-of-the-art results on the
publicly available OMOMO and 3D-FUTURE datasets, demonstrating strong
generalization abilities to unseen objects, while enabling high-fidelity 4D HOI
generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LGE心脏MRI图像中高质量瘢痕标签的稀缺和变异性限制了稳健分割模型的发展。

Method: CLAIM框架结合SMILE模块（基于临床知识的瘢痕掩模生成）和扩散生成器，生成解剖学一致的瘢痕图像，并采用联合训练策略优化分割网络。

Result: CLAIM生成的瘢痕模式解剖学一致，与真实瘢痕分布的Dice相似度高于基线模型。

Conclusion: CLAIM实现了可控且真实的瘢痕合成，对下游医学影像任务具有实用价值。

Abstract: Deep learning-based myocardial scar segmentation from late gadolinium
enhancement (LGE) cardiac MRI has shown great potential for accurate and timely
diagnosis and treatment planning for structural cardiac diseases. However, the
limited availability and variability of LGE images with high-quality scar
labels restrict the development of robust segmentation models. To address this,
we introduce CLAIM: \textbf{C}linically-Guided \textbf{L}GE
\textbf{A}ugmentation for Real\textbf{i}stic and Diverse \textbf{M}yocardial
Scar Synthesis and Segmentation framework, a framework for anatomically
grounded scar generation and segmentation. At its core is the SMILE module
(Scar Mask generation guided by cLinical knowledgE), which conditions a
diffusion-based generator on the clinically adopted AHA 17-segment model to
synthesize images with anatomically consistent and spatially diverse scar
patterns. In addition, CLAIM employs a joint training strategy in which the
scar segmentation network is optimized alongside the generator, aiming to
enhance both the realism of synthesized scars and the accuracy of the scar
segmentation performance. Experimental results show that CLAIM produces
anatomically coherent scar patterns and achieves higher Dice similarity with
real scar distributions compared to baseline models. Our approach enables
controllable and realistic myocardial scar synthesis and has demonstrated
utility for downstream medical imaging task.

<details>

Motivation: 现有基于预训练扩散模型的方法在布局到图像生成中存在定位不准和伪影问题，WinWinLay旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 提出非局部注意力能量函数和基于Langevin动力学的自适应更新策略，优化注意力分布和更新规则。

Result: 实验表明，WinWinLay在元素控制和视觉逼真度上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: WinWinLay通过创新策略显著提升了布局到图像生成的精度和真实感。

Abstract: Layout-to-Image generation aims to create complex scenes with precise control
over the placement and arrangement of subjects. Existing works have
demonstrated that pre-trained Text-to-Image diffusion models can achieve this
goal without training on any specific data; however, they often face challenges
with imprecise localization and unrealistic artifacts. Focusing on these
drawbacks, we propose a novel training-free method, WinWinLay. At its core,
WinWinLay presents two key strategies, Non-local Attention Energy Function and
Adaptive Update, that collaboratively enhance control precision and realism. On
one hand, we theoretically demonstrate that the commonly used attention energy
function introduces inherent spatial distribution biases, hindering objects
from being uniformly aligned with layout instructions. To overcome this issue,
non-local attention prior is explored to redistribute attention scores,
facilitating objects to better conform to the specified spatial conditions. On
the other hand, we identify that the vanilla backpropagation update rule can
cause deviations from the pre-trained domain, leading to out-of-distribution
artifacts. We accordingly introduce a Langevin dynamics-based adaptive update
scheme as a remedy that promotes in-domain updating while respecting layout
constraints. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WinWinLay excels in
controlling element placement and achieving photorealistic visual fidelity,
outperforming the current state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: This paper presents improved native unified multimodal models, \emph{i.e.,}

3D causal variational autoencoder space, unified visual representations are
constructed through a dual-path of spatial (-temporal) fusion, enabling
scalability across image and video modalities while ensuring effective
multimodal understanding and generation. Based on a language model,
autoregressive modeling and flow matching are natively applied to the language
head and flow head, respectively, to facilitate text token prediction and
image/video generation. A two-stage training recipe is designed to effectively
learn and scale to larger models. The resulting Show-o2 models demonstrate

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超高空间分辨率土地覆盖分类面临标注成本高、尺度变化大和大规模视觉模型适应性有限的问题。

Method: 采用半监督分割框架，结合SAM2知识和FreqWeaver Adapter，参数效率高。

Result: 在结构一致性和分割性能上优于现有方法，提升1.78%和3.44%。

Conclusion: 该方法在弱监督下实现了高效且鲁棒的细粒度土地覆盖分类。

Abstract: Ultra-high Spatial Resolution Land Cover Classification is essential for
fine-grained land cover analysis, yet it remains challenging due to the high
cost of pixel-level annotations, significant scale variation, and the limited
adaptability of large-scale vision models. Existing methods typically focus on
1-meter spatial resolution imagery and rely heavily on annotated data, whereas
practical applications often require processing higher-resolution imagery under
weak supervision. To address this, we propose a parameter-efficient
semi-supervised segmentation framework for 0.3 m spatial resolution imagery,
which leverages the knowledge of SAM2 and introduces a remote sensing-specific
FreqWeaver Adapter to enhance fine-grained detail modeling while maintaining a
lightweight design at only 5.96% of the total model parameters. By effectively
leveraging unlabeled data and maintaining minimal parameter overhead, the
proposed method delivers robust segmentation results with superior structural
consistency, achieving a 1.78% improvement over existing parameter-efficient
tuning strategies and a 3.44% gain compared to state-of-the-art high-resolution
remote sensing segmentation approaches.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图的新型统一框架，用于大规模点云的端到端处理，显著提高了森林地上生物量（AGB）估计的可行性和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有QSM方法依赖高质量点云数据和复杂预处理步骤，限制了其可扩展性和实际应用。

Method: 通过创新的基于图的流程，无缝集成树分割、叶木分离和3D骨架重建，减少了对专用预处理工具的依赖。

Result: 在多种条件下（如叶开和叶落、不同数据源）表现出强健性能，相对误差低至20%。

Conclusion: 该框架为大规模AGB估计提供了稳健且可扩展的解决方案，推动了QSM在森林调查和气候变化研究中的广泛应用。

Abstract: Estimating forest above-ground biomass (AGB) is crucial for assessing carbon
storage and supporting sustainable forest management. Quantitative Structural
Model (QSM) offers a non-destructive approach to AGB estimation through 3D tree
structural reconstruction. However, current QSM methods face significant
limitations, as they are primarily designed for individual trees,depend on
high-quality point cloud data from terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), and also
require multiple pre-processing steps that hinder scalability and practical
deployment. This study presents a novel unified framework that enables
end-to-end processing of large-scale point clouds using an innovative
graph-based pipeline. The proposed approach seamlessly integrates tree
segmentation,leaf-wood separation and 3D skeletal reconstruction through
dedicated graph operations including pathing and abstracting for tree topology
reasoning. Comprehensive validation was conducted on datasets with varying leaf
conditions (leaf-on and leaf-off), spatial scales (tree- and plot-level), and
data sources (TLS and UAV-based laser scanning, ULS). Experimental results
demonstrate strong performance under challenging conditions, particularly in
leaf-on scenarios (~20% relative error) and low-density ULS datasets with
partial coverage (~30% relative error). These findings indicate that the
proposed framework provides a robust and scalable solution for large-scale,
non-destructive AGB estimation. It significantly reduces dependency on
specialized pre-processing tools and establishes ULS as a viable alternative to
TLS. To our knowledge, this is the first method capable of enabling seamless,
end-to-end 3D tree reconstruction at operational scales. This advancement
substantially improves the feasibility of QSM-based AGB estimation, paving the
way for broader applications in forest inventory and climate change research.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为DLoRAL的双LoRA学习范式，通过结合Cross-Frame Retrieval模块和两个LoRA分支（C-LoRA和D-LoRA），在视频超分辨率任务中同时实现细节增强和时间一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于稳定扩散（SD）的视频超分辨率方法在保持时间一致性时牺牲了空间细节，导致视觉质量不佳。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用双LoRA学习范式，包括CFR模块提取跨帧互补信息，C-LoRA学习时间一致性，D-LoRA增强细节，并通过交替优化实现协同效果。

Result: 实验表明，DLoRAL在精度和速度上均表现优异，能够高效生成细节丰富且时间一致的视频。

Conclusion: DLoRAL通过双LoRA学习范式，成功解决了视频超分辨率中细节与时间一致性的平衡问题，为实际应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: It is a challenging problem to reproduce rich spatial details while
maintaining temporal consistency in real-world video super-resolution
(Real-VSR), especially when we leverage pre-trained generative models such as
stable diffusion (SD) for realistic details synthesis. Existing SD-based
Real-VSR methods often compromise spatial details for temporal coherence,
resulting in suboptimal visual quality. We argue that the key lies in how to
effectively extract the degradation-robust temporal consistency priors from the
low-quality (LQ) input video and enhance the video details while maintaining
the extracted consistency priors. To achieve this, we propose a Dual LoRA
Learning (DLoRAL) paradigm to train an effective SD-based one-step diffusion
model, achieving realistic frame details and temporal consistency
simultaneously. Specifically, we introduce a Cross-Frame Retrieval (CFR) module
to aggregate complementary information across frames, and train a
Consistency-LoRA (C-LoRA) to learn robust temporal representations from
degraded inputs. After consistency learning, we fix the CFR and C-LoRA modules
and train a Detail-LoRA (D-LoRA) to enhance spatial details while aligning with
the temporal space defined by C-LoRA to keep temporal coherence. The two phases
alternate iteratively for optimization, collaboratively delivering consistent
and detail-rich outputs. During inference, the two LoRA branches are merged
into the SD model, allowing efficient and high-quality video restoration in a
single diffusion step. Experiments show that DLoRAL achieves strong performance
in both accuracy and speed. Code and models are available at
https://github.com/yjsunnn/DLoRAL.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为M2M-Reg的新框架，用于解决多模态图像配准中因模态差异大导致的配准困难问题，通过单模态相似性训练模型，并引入GradCyCon正则化器提升效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床实践中，功能成像模态（如PET、FA）与结构参考（如MRI、CT）的配准因模态差异大，传统无监督配准方法效果不佳，易导致图像失真。

Method: 提出M2M-Reg框架，仅使用单模态相似性训练多模态配准模型，并引入GradCyCon正则化器促进微分同胚性。支持半监督学习，无需真实变换或分割掩码。

Result: 在ADNI数据集上，M2M-Reg在PET-MRI和FA-MRI配准中DSC值比现有方法提高2倍。

Conclusion: M2M-Reg能有效处理高度异质的多模态配准问题，且易于集成到现有模型中。

Abstract: In clinical practice, imaging modalities with functional characteristics,
such as positron emission tomography (PET) and fractional anisotropy (FA), are
often aligned with a structural reference (e.g., MRI, CT) for accurate
interpretation or group analysis, necessitating multi-modal deformable image
registration (DIR). However, due to the extreme heterogeneity of these
modalities compared to standard structural scans, conventional unsupervised DIR
methods struggle to learn reliable spatial mappings and often distort images.
We find that the similarity metrics guiding these models fail to capture
alignment between highly disparate modalities. To address this, we propose
M2M-Reg (Multi-to-Mono Registration), a novel framework that trains multi-modal
DIR models using only mono-modal similarity while preserving the established
architectural paradigm for seamless integration into existing models. We also
introduce GradCyCon, a regularizer that leverages M2M-Reg's cyclic training
scheme to promote diffeomorphism. Furthermore, our framework naturally extends
to a semi-supervised setting, integrating pre-aligned and unaligned pairs only,
without requiring ground-truth transformations or segmentation masks.
Experiments on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset
demonstrate that M2M-Reg achieves up to 2x higher DSC than prior methods for
PET-MRI and FA-MRI registration, highlighting its effectiveness in handling
highly heterogeneous multi-modal DIR. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D检测方法依赖密集点云重构，计算和内存开销大，难以实时部署。

Method: 利用Cubify Anything和CLIP进行单视角检测，通过关联模块和优化模块融合多视角检测结果。

Result: 在ScanNetV2和CA-1M数据集上达到SOTA性能，支持实时感知大场景。

Conclusion: 无需重构的框架具有高效性和泛化能力，适用于实时3D检测任务。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D object detection has gained significant interest due to
its critical applications in autonomous driving and embodied AI. Existing
detection methods, whether offline or online, typically rely on dense point
cloud reconstruction, which imposes substantial computational overhead and
memory constraints, hindering real-time deployment in downstream tasks. To
address this, we propose a novel reconstruction-free online framework tailored
for memory-efficient and real-time 3D detection. Specifically, given streaming
posed RGB-D video input, we leverage Cubify Anything as a pre-trained visual
foundation model (VFM) for single-view 3D object detection by bounding boxes,
coupled with CLIP to capture open-vocabulary semantics of detected objects. To
fuse all detected bounding boxes across different views into a unified one, we
employ an association module for correspondences of multi-views and an
optimization module to fuse the 3D bounding boxes of the same instance
predicted in multi-views. The association module utilizes 3D Non-Maximum
Suppression (NMS) and a box correspondence matching module, while the
optimization module uses an IoU-guided efficient random optimization technique
based on particle filtering to enforce multi-view consistency of the 3D
bounding boxes while minimizing computational complexity. Extensive experiments
on ScanNetV2 and CA-1M datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance among online methods. Benefiting from this novel
reconstruction-free paradigm for 3D object detection, our method exhibits great
generalization abilities in various scenarios, enabling real-time perception
even in environments exceeding 1000 square meters.

TL;DR: HOIDiNi是一个基于文本驱动的扩散框架，用于生成真实且合理的人-物交互（HOI）。通过Diffusion Noise Optimization（DNO）在预训练扩散模型的噪声空间中进行优化，同时实现了真实性和物理正确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的人-物交互生成方法在真实性和物理正确性之间存在权衡，HOIDiNi旨在通过结构化方法解决这一问题。

Method: HOIDiNi将问题分为两个阶段：对象中心阶段（选择手-物接触位置）和人体中心阶段（优化全身动作）。使用DNO在噪声空间中进行优化。

Result: 在GRAB数据集上的定量、定性和主观评估表明，HOIDiNi在接触准确性、物理有效性和整体质量上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HOIDiNi能够生成复杂且可控的交互动作（如抓取、放置和全身协调），仅通过文本提示驱动。

Abstract: We present HOIDiNi, a text-driven diffusion framework for synthesizing
realistic and plausible human-object interaction (HOI). HOI generation is
extremely challenging since it induces strict contact accuracies alongside a
diverse motion manifold. While current literature trades off between realism
and physical correctness, HOIDiNi optimizes directly in the noise space of a
pretrained diffusion model using Diffusion Noise Optimization (DNO), achieving
both. This is made feasible thanks to our observation that the problem can be
separated into two phases: an object-centric phase, primarily making discrete
choices of hand-object contact locations, and a human-centric phase that
refines the full-body motion to realize this blueprint. This structured
approach allows for precise hand-object contact without compromising motion
naturalness. Quantitative, qualitative, and subjective evaluations on the GRAB
dataset alone clearly indicate HOIDiNi outperforms prior works and baselines in
contact accuracy, physical validity, and overall quality. Our results
demonstrate the ability to generate complex, controllable interactions,
including grasping, placing, and full-body coordination, driven solely by
textual prompts. https://hoidini.github.io.

TL;DR: 研究发现，多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在视觉质量与任务表现之间存在矛盾：图像质量偏离人类感知时，模型表现反而可能提升。为此，作者提出了一种轻量级适配模块VQ-TTT，通过动态调整输入图像，显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索视觉输入质量如何影响MLLMs的表现，揭示现有模型对视觉质量的偏好与人类感知不一致的现象。

Method: 提出VQ-TTT模块，通过可学习的低秩核和浅层LoRA微调，动态调整输入图像以适应模型偏好。

Result: VQ-TTT在所有测试数据集和MLLMs中显著提升了平均准确率，无需额外数据或外部模型。

Conclusion: 研究重新定义了MLLMs的“更好”视觉输入标准，强调需要自适应而非通用的“干净”图像。

Abstract: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel on benchmark
vision-language tasks, yet little is known about how input visual quality
shapes their responses. Does higher perceptual quality of images already
translate to better MLLM understanding? We conduct the first systematic study
spanning leading MLLMs and a suite of vision-language benchmarks, applying
controlled degradations and stylistic shifts to each image. Surprisingly, we
uncover a visual-quality paradox: model, task, and even individual-instance
performance can improve when images deviate from human-perceived fidelity.
Off-the-shelf restoration pipelines fail to reconcile these idiosyncratic
preferences. To close the gap, we introduce Visual-Quality Test-Time Tuning
(VQ-TTT)-a lightweight adaptation module that: (1) inserts a learnable,
low-rank kernel before the frozen vision encoder to modulate frequency content;
and (2) fine-tunes only shallow vision-encoder layers via LoRA. VQ-TTT
dynamically adjusts each input image in a single forward pass, aligning it with
task-specific model preferences. Across the evaluated MLLMs and all datasets,
VQ-TTT lifts significant average accuracy, with no external models, cached
features, or extra training data. These findings redefine ``better'' visual
inputs for MLLMs and highlight the need for adaptive, rather than universally
``clean'', imagery, in the new era of AI being the main data customer.

Motivation: 现有方法计算成本高且易产生低置信度生成，导致幻觉问题。

Method: ViMaR分两阶段：首阶段选择最高价值候选标题，次阶段选择性优化弱视觉基础部分。

Result: ViMaR生成更可靠、准确的标题，速度提升4倍，并能跨模型泛化。

Conclusion: ViMaR具有灵活性、可扩展性，并能通过自训练提升模型性能。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in inference-time search for vision-language
models (VLMs), existing approaches remain both computationally expensive and
prone to unpenalized, low-confidence generations which often lead to persistent
hallucinations. We introduce \textbf{Value-guided Inference with Margin-based
Reward (ViMaR)}, a two-stage inference framework that improves both efficiency
and output fidelity by combining a temporal-difference value model with a
margin-aware reward adjustment. In the first stage, we perform a single pass to
identify the highest-value caption among diverse candidates. In the second
stage, we selectively refine only those segments that were overlooked or
exhibit weak visual grounding, thereby eliminating frequently rewarded
evaluations. A calibrated margin-based penalty discourages low-confidence
continuations while preserving descriptive richness. Extensive experiments
across multiple VLM architectures demonstrate that ViMaR generates captions
that are significantly more reliable, factually accurate, detailed, and
explanatory, while achieving over 4$\times$ speedup compared to existing
value-guided methods. Specifically, we show that ViMaR trained solely on LLaVA
Mistral-7B, \textit{generalizes effectively to guide decoding in a stronger
unseen model}. To further validate this, we adapt the ViMaR to steer generation
in LLaVA-OneVision-Qwen2-7B, leading to consistent improvements in caption
quality and demonstrating robust cross-model guidance. This cross-model
generalization highlights ViMaR's flexibility and modularity, positioning it as
a scalable and transferable inference-time decoding strategy. Furthermore, when
ViMaR-generated captions are used for self-training, the underlying models
achieve substantial gains across a broad suite of visual comprehension
benchmarks, underscoring the potential of fast, accurate, and self-improving
VLM pipelines.

Abstract: We address the challenge of relighting a single image or video, a task that
demands precise scene intrinsic understanding and high-quality light transport
synthesis. Existing end-to-end relighting models are often limited by the
scarcity of paired multi-illumination data, restricting their ability to
generalize across diverse scenes. Conversely, two-stage pipelines that combine
inverse and forward rendering can mitigate data requirements but are
susceptible to error accumulation and often fail to produce realistic outputs
under complex lighting conditions or with sophisticated materials. In this
work, we introduce a general-purpose approach that jointly estimates albedo and
synthesizes relit outputs in a single pass, harnessing the generative
capabilities of video diffusion models. This joint formulation enhances
implicit scene comprehension and facilitates the creation of realistic lighting
effects and intricate material interactions, such as shadows, reflections, and
transparency. Trained on synthetic multi-illumination data and extensive
automatically labeled real-world videos, our model demonstrates strong
generalization across diverse domains and surpasses previous methods in both
visual fidelity and temporal consistency.

Abstract: Video generation techniques have made remarkable progress, promising to be

generation datasets are not well-suited for world exploration training as they
suffer from some limitations: limited locations, short duration, static scenes,
and a lack of annotations about exploration and the world. In this paper, we
introduce Sekai (meaning ``world'' in Japanese), a high-quality first-person
view worldwide video dataset with rich annotations for world exploration. It
consists of over 5,000 hours of walking or drone view (FPV and UVA) videos from
over 100 countries and regions across 750 cities. We develop an efficient and
effective toolbox to collect, pre-process and annotate videos with location,
scene, weather, crowd density, captions, and camera trajectories. Experiments
demonstrate the quality of the dataset. And, we use a subset to train an
interactive video world exploration model, named YUME (meaning ``dream'' in
Japanese). We believe Sekai will benefit the area of video generation and world
exploration, and motivate valuable applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型生成高质量图像但推理速度慢且计算成本高，现有方法依赖固定启发式规则，效果有限且泛化性差。

Method: 提出ECAD，利用遗传算法学习高效的缓存调度策略，形成帕累托前沿，仅需少量校准提示。

Conclusion: ECAD是一种可扩展且泛化性强的扩散模型加速方法，适用于不同模型和分辨率。

Abstract: Diffusion-based image generation models excel at producing high-quality
synthetic content, but suffer from slow and computationally expensive
inference. Prior work has attempted to mitigate this by caching and reusing
features within diffusion transformers across inference steps. These methods,
however, often rely on rigid heuristics that result in limited acceleration or
poor generalization across architectures. We propose Evolutionary Caching to
Accelerate Diffusion models (ECAD), a genetic algorithm that learns efficient,
per-model, caching schedules forming a Pareto frontier, using only a small set
of calibration prompts. ECAD requires no modifications to network parameters or
reference images. It offers significant inference speedups, enables
fine-grained control over the quality-latency trade-off, and adapts seamlessly
to different diffusion models. Notably, ECAD's learned schedules can generalize
effectively to resolutions and model variants not seen during calibration. We
evaluate ECAD on PixArt-alpha, PixArt-Sigma, and FLUX-1.dev using multiple
metrics (FID, CLIP, Image Reward) across diverse benchmarks (COCO, MJHQ-30k,
PartiPrompts), demonstrating consistent improvements over previous approaches.
On PixArt-alpha, ECAD identifies a schedule that outperforms the previous
state-of-the-art method by 4.47 COCO FID while increasing inference speedup
from 2.35x to 2.58x. Our results establish ECAD as a scalable and generalizable
approach for accelerating diffusion inference. Our project website is available

*Burcu Sayin,Ipek Baris Schlicht,Ngoc Vo Hong,Sara Allievi,Jacopo Staiano,Pasquale Minervini,Andrea Passerini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为MedSyn的混合人机框架，通过多步交互对话优化临床决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床决策复杂，受认知偏差和信息不完整影响，现有LLM工具交互有限，难以满足实际需求。

Method: 设计MedSyn框架，支持医生与LLM动态互动，挑战建议并探讨替代方案。

Result: 开源LLM在模拟实验中显示出作为医生助手的潜力。

Conclusion: 未来将通过真实医生互动验证MedSyn在诊断准确性和患者结果中的实用性。

Abstract: Clinical decision-making is inherently complex, often influenced by cognitive
biases, incomplete information, and case ambiguity. Large Language Models
(LLMs) have shown promise as tools for supporting clinical decision-making, yet
their typical one-shot or limited-interaction usage may overlook the
complexities of real-world medical practice. In this work, we propose a hybrid
human-AI framework, MedSyn, where physicians and LLMs engage in multi-step,
interactive dialogues to refine diagnoses and treatment decisions. Unlike
static decision-support tools, MedSyn enables dynamic exchanges, allowing
physicians to challenge LLM suggestions while the LLM highlights alternative
perspectives. Through simulated physician-LLM interactions, we assess the
potential of open-source LLMs as physician assistants. Results show open-source
LLMs are promising as physician assistants in the real world. Future work will
involve real physician interactions to further validate MedSyn's usefulness in
diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes.

### [131] [Two-dimensional Parallel Tempering for Constrained Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14781)
*Corentin Delacour,M Mahmudul Hasan Sajeeb,Joao P. Hespanha,Kerem Y. Camsari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种二维并行回火算法（2D-PT），通过引入惩罚强度的第二维度副本，解决了传统方法在约束优化问题中的混合速度慢或约束失效的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在机器学习和优化中，Boltzmann概率分布的采样是关键，但现有方法（如Ising机）在处理约束时效率低下，需要手动调整惩罚强度。

Method: 提出2D-PT算法，通过第二维度副本插值惩罚强度，确保约束满足并提升混合效率。

Result: 在图形稀疏化和Wishart实例中，2D-PT实现了接近理想的混合速度，且比传统PT快数个数量级。

Conclusion: 2D-PT广泛适用于约束Ising问题，可直接部署于现有Ising机，无需手动调整惩罚强度。

Abstract: Sampling Boltzmann probability distributions plays a key role in machine
learning and optimization, motivating the design of hardware accelerators such
as Ising machines. While the Ising model can in principle encode arbitrary
optimization problems, practical implementations are often hindered by soft
constraints that either slow down mixing when too strong, or fail to enforce
feasibility when too weak. We introduce a two-dimensional extension of the
powerful parallel tempering algorithm (PT) that addresses this challenge by
adding a second dimension of replicas interpolating the penalty strengths. This
scheme ensures constraint satisfaction in the final replicas, analogous to
low-energy states at low temperature. The resulting two-dimensional parallel
tempering algorithm (2D-PT) improves mixing in heavily constrained replicas and
eliminates the need to explicitly tune the penalty strength. In a
representative example of graph sparsification with copy constraints, 2D-PT
achieves near-ideal mixing, with Kullback-Leibler divergence decaying as
O(1/t). When applied to sparsified Wishart instances, 2D-PT yields orders of
magnitude speedup over conventional PT with the same number of replicas. The
method applies broadly to constrained Ising problems and can be deployed on
existing Ising machines.

TL;DR: 论文分析了两种AI方法：DeepSeek-V3（大规模通用模型）和NetraAI（基于动态系统的小数据集稳定可解释框架）。NetraAI结合多种技术识别高效应子群，并通过LLM优化发现过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决小临床数据集上模型的稳定性与可解释性问题，同时探索高效应子群的识别方法。

Method: NetraAI结合收缩映射、信息几何和进化算法，通过动态系统识别潜在子群，并引入LLM作为元进化层优化变量选择。

Result: 在多个案例中，NetraAI将弱基线模型（AUC 0.50-0.68）提升为近乎完美的分类器，仅需少量特征。

Conclusion: NetraAI为临床发现提供了自适应、可解释的AI新范式，结合动态系统与信息几何，推动概念级推理发展。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has evolved into an ecosystem of specialized
"species," each with unique strengths. We analyze two: DeepSeek-V3, a
671-billion-parameter Mixture of Experts large language model (LLM)
exemplifying scale-driven generality, and NetraAI, a dynamical system-based
framework engineered for stability and interpretability on small clinical trial
datasets. We formalize NetraAI's foundations, combining contraction mappings,
information geometry, and evolutionary algorithms to identify predictive
patient cohorts. Features are embedded in a metric space and iteratively
contracted toward stable attractors that define latent subgroups. A
pseudo-temporal embedding and long-range memory enable exploration of
higher-order feature interactions, while an internal evolutionary loop selects
compact, explainable 2-4-variable bundles ("Personas").
  To guide discovery, we introduce an LLM Strategist as a meta-evolutionary
layer that observes Persona outputs, prioritizes promising variables, injects
domain knowledge, and assesses robustness. This two-tier architecture mirrors
the human scientific process: NetraAI as experimentalist, the LLM as theorist,
forming a self-improving loop.
  In case studies (schizophrenia, depression, pancreatic cancer), NetraAI
uncovered small, high-effect-size subpopulations that transformed weak baseline
models (AUC ~0.50-0.68) into near-perfect classifiers using only a few
features. We position NetraAI at the intersection of dynamical systems,
information geometry, and evolutionary learning, aligned with emerging
concept-level reasoning paradigms such as LeCun's Joint Embedding Predictive
Architecture (JEPA). By prioritizing reliable, explainable knowledge, NetraAI
offers a new generation of adaptive, self-reflective AI to accelerate clinical
discovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决非侵入式EEG在开放词汇场景下解码自然语言的挑战，传统方法因噪声和变异性表现不佳。

Method: 提出ETS框架，整合EEG与同步眼动数据，用于开放词汇文本生成和情感分类。

Result: 在BLEU和Rouge分数上表现优异，情感分类F1分数提升10%，且能处理多源数据。

Conclusion: ETS框架在开放词汇EEG解码中具有高性能潜力。

Abstract: Decoding natural language from brain activity using non-invasive
electroencephalography (EEG) remains a significant challenge in neuroscience
and machine learning, particularly for open-vocabulary scenarios where
traditional methods struggle with noise and variability. Previous studies have
achieved high accuracy on small-closed vocabularies, but it still struggles on
open vocabularies. In this study, we propose ETS, a framework that integrates
EEG with synchronized eye-tracking data to address two critical tasks: (1)
open-vocabulary text generation and (2) sentiment classification of perceived
language. Our model achieves a superior performance on BLEU and Rouge score for
EEG-To-Text decoding and up to 10% F1 score on EEG-based ternary sentiment
classification, which significantly outperforms supervised baselines.
Furthermore, we show that our proposed model can handle data from various
subjects and sources, showing great potential for high performance open
vocabulary eeg-to-text system.

TL;DR: FedNano是一个联邦学习框架，通过集中LLM在服务器端并引入轻量级NanoEdge模块，解决了MLLM在分布式数据下的部署挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型（MLLM）在分布式数据和隐私要求下的部署难题。

Method: 提出FedNano框架，集中LLM于服务器，客户端使用轻量级NanoEdge模块（包含模态编码器、连接器和低秩适配器）。

Result: 减少客户端存储95%，通信开销仅为模型参数的0.01%，性能优于现有联邦学习方法。

Conclusion: FedNano为大规模MLLM的联邦学习提供了可行方案，支持去中心化多模态AI系统。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in tasks like multimodal
reasoning and cross-modal retrieval but face deployment challenges in
real-world scenarios due to distributed multimodal data and strict privacy
requirements. Federated Learning (FL) offers a solution by enabling
collaborative model training without centralizing data. However, realizing FL
for MLLMs presents significant challenges, including high computational
demands, limited client capacity, substantial communication costs, and
heterogeneous client data. Existing FL methods assume client-side deployment of
full models, an assumption that breaks down for large-scale MLLMs due to their
massive size and communication demands. To address these limitations, we
propose FedNano, the first FL framework that centralizes the LLM on the server
while introducing NanoEdge, a lightweight module for client-specific
adaptation. NanoEdge employs modality-specific encoders, connectors, and
trainable NanoAdapters with low-rank adaptation. This design eliminates the
need to deploy LLM on clients, reducing client-side storage by 95%, and
limiting communication overhead to only 0.01% of the model parameters. By
transmitting only compact NanoAdapter updates, FedNano handles heterogeneous
client data and resource constraints while preserving privacy. Experiments
demonstrate that FedNano outperforms prior FL baselines, bridging the gap
between MLLM scale and FL feasibility, and enabling scalable, decentralized
multimodal AI systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于迁移学习的方法，通过卷积神经网络（ConvNet）预测流动参数（如攻角和流速），解决了传感器故障和实时学习的需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统直接测量流动参数的方法在传感器故障时存在挑战，且实际应用需要接近实时的学习能力。

Method: 采用迁移学习方法，先离线训练ConvNet模型，冻结部分层权重，再通过重新训练适应新任务或数据分布变化。

Result: 方法成功适应了数据分布变化、领域扩展和任务更新，但对噪声数据的处理效果不佳。

Conclusion: 该方法在流动参数预测中具有潜力，尤其在适应变化和实时学习方面，但对噪声数据的适应性需进一步改进。

Abstract: Determining onflow parameters is crucial from the perspectives of wind tunnel
testing and regular flight and wind turbine operations. These parameters have
traditionally been predicted via direct measurements which might lead to
challenges in case of sensor faults. Alternatively, a data-driven prediction
model based on surface pressure data can be used to determine these parameters.
It is essential that such predictors achieve close to real-time learning as
dictated by practical applications such as monitoring wind tunnel operations or
learning the variations in aerodynamic performance of aerospace and wind energy
systems. To overcome the challenges caused by changes in the data distribution
as well as in adapting to a new prediction task, we propose a transfer learning
methodology to predict the onflow parameters, specifically angle of attack and
onflow speed. It requires first training a convolutional neural network
(ConvNet) model offline for the core prediction task, then freezing the weights
of this model except the selected layers preceding the output node, and finally
executing transfer learning by retraining these layers. A demonstration of this
approach is provided using steady CFD analysis data for an airfoil for i)
domain adaptation where transfer learning is performed with data from a target
domain having different data distribution than the source domain and ii) task
adaptation where the prediction task is changed. Further exploration on the
influence of noisy data, performance on an extended domain, and trade studies
varying sampling sizes and architectures are provided. Results successfully
demonstrate the potential of the approach for adaptation to changing data
distribution, domain extension, and task update while the application for noisy
data is concluded to be not as effective.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为PIPE的轻量级方法，通过物理信息位置编码提升多模态时间序列预测的准确性，特别是在卫星图像数据中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注文本数据，忽略了视觉数据中的物理信息（如卫星图像的时空背景），导致预测效果受限。

Method: PIPE包含两个创新：1) 物理信息位置索引方案；2) 变频率位置编码机制，用于嵌入物理变量和序列顺序信息。

Result: 在最大开源卫星图像数据集上，PIPE实现了最先进的性能，台风强度预测比先前工作提升了12%。

Conclusion: PIPE通过嵌入物理信息显著提升了多模态对齐和预测准确性，为气候科学等领域提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Multimodal time series forecasting is foundational in various fields, such as
utilizing satellite imagery and numerical data for predicting typhoons in
climate science. However, existing multimodal approaches primarily focus on
utilizing text data to help time series forecasting, leaving the visual data in
existing time series datasets untouched. Furthermore, it is challenging for
models to effectively capture the physical information embedded in visual data,
such as satellite imagery's temporal and geospatial context, which extends
beyond images themselves. To address this gap, we propose physics-informed
positional encoding (PIPE), a lightweight method that embeds physical
information into vision language models (VLMs). PIPE introduces two key
innovations: (1) a physics-informed positional indexing scheme for mapping
physics to positional IDs, and (2) a variant-frequency positional encoding
mechanism for encoding frequency information of physical variables and
sequential order of tokens within the embedding space. By preserving both the
physical information and sequential order information, PIPE significantly
improves multimodal alignment and forecasting accuracy. Through the experiments
on the most representative and the largest open-sourced satellite image
dataset, PIPE achieves state-of-the-art performance in both deep learning
forecasting and climate domain methods, demonstrating superiority across
benchmarks, including a 12% improvement in typhoon intensity forecasting over
prior works. Our code is provided in the supplementary material.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代物流对高效高密度存储系统的需求增加，但多深度存储系统因车道阻塞问题面临挑战，传统方法限制了系统的灵活性。

Method: 采用图神经网络（GNN）和Transformer模型结合的架构，通过图表示系统拓扑和物品属性，优化检索优先级。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在优化检索延迟方面优于启发式方法，且能适应不同布局的存储系统。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了多深度存储系统中的检索问题，提升了系统的灵活性和效率。

Abstract: In modern industrial and logistics environments, the rapid expansion of fast
delivery services has heightened the demand for storage systems that combine
high efficiency with increased density. Multi-deep autonomous vehicle storage
and retrieval systems (AVS/RS) present a viable solution for achieving greater
storage density. However, these systems encounter significant challenges during
retrieval operations due to lane blockages. A conventional approach to mitigate
this issue involves storing items with homogeneous characteristics in a single
lane, but this strategy restricts the flexibility and adaptability of
multi-deep storage systems.
  In this study, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based framework to
address the retrieval problem in multi-deep storage systems with heterogeneous
item configurations. Each item is associated with a specific due date, and the
objective is to minimize total tardiness. To effectively capture the system's
topology, we introduce a graph-based state representation that integrates both
item attributes and the local topological structure of the multi-deep
warehouse. To process this representation, we design a novel neural network
architecture that combines a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with a Transformer
model. The GNN encodes topological and item-specific information into
embeddings for all directly accessible items, while the Transformer maps these
embeddings into global priority assignments. The Transformer's strong
generalization capability further allows our approach to be applied to storage
systems with diverse layouts. Extensive numerical experiments, including
comparisons with heuristic methods, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
neural network architecture and the effectiveness of the trained agent in
optimizing retrieval tardiness.

Motivation: 现有公开数据集缺乏详细和全面的1型糖尿病患者数据，限制了数据驱动方法的发展。

Method: 收集25名使用自动胰岛素输送系统的患者的连续血糖监测、胰岛素泵数据、碳水化合物摄入和设备模式等数据。

Result: AZT1D提供了丰富的自然数据，包括罕见的胰岛素输送细节。

Conclusion: AZT1D数据集支持AI和机器学习应用，有助于改善1型糖尿病的临床决策和个性化护理。

Abstract: High quality real world datasets are essential for advancing data driven
approaches in type 1 diabetes (T1D) management, including personalized therapy
design, digital twin systems, and glucose prediction models. However, progress
in this area has been limited by the scarcity of publicly available datasets
that offer detailed and comprehensive patient data. To address this gap, we
present AZT1D, a dataset containing data collected from 25 individuals with T1D
on automated insulin delivery (AID) systems. AZT1D includes continuous glucose
monitoring (CGM) data, insulin pump and insulin administration data,
carbohydrate intake, and device mode (regular, sleep, and exercise) obtained
over 6 to 8 weeks for each patient. Notably, the dataset provides granular
details on bolus insulin delivery (i.e., total dose, bolus type, correction
specific amounts) features that are rarely found in existing datasets. By
offering rich, naturalistic data, AZT1D supports a wide range of artificial
intelligence and machine learning applications aimed at improving clinical
decision making and individualized care in T1D.

*Tianxiang Zhan,Ming Jin,Yuanpeng He,Yuxuan Liang,Yong Deng,Shirui Pan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为连续进化池（CEP）的机制，用于处理时间序列中重复出现的概念漂移问题，通过存储不同概念的预测器实例并动态更新知识，显著提升了在线预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重复概念漂移是时间序列中常见的问题，现有方法通过参数更新延缓遗忘，但可能导致部分已学知识丢失。CEP旨在保留所有概念知识并在概念重现时充分利用。

Method: CEP通过存储不同概念的预测器实例，选择最接近测试样本的预测器并学习其邻近样本特征（检索机制）。若邻近样本不足，则生成新模型存储新概念知识，同时淘汰过时知识。

Result: 在不同架构模型和八个真实数据集上的实验表明，CEP能有效保留不同概念知识，显著提升重复概念场景下的在线预测效果。

Conclusion: CEP通过动态存储和更新知识，解决了重复概念漂移问题，显著提升了预测准确性。

Abstract: Recurring concept drift, a type of concept drift in which previously observed
data patterns reappear after some time, is one of the most prevalent types of
concept drift in time series. As time progresses, concept drift occurs and
previously encountered concepts are forgotten, thereby leading to a decline in
the accuracy of online predictions. Existing solutions employ parameter
updating techniques to delay forgetting; however, this may result in the loss
of some previously learned knowledge while neglecting the exploration of
knowledge retention mechanisms. To retain all conceptual knowledge and fully
utilize it when the concepts recur, we propose the Continuous Evolution Pool
(CEP), a pooling mechanism that stores different instances of forecasters for
different concepts. Our method first selects the forecaster nearest to the test
sample and then learns the features from its neighboring samples - a process we
refer to as the retrieval. If there are insufficient neighboring samples, it
indicates that a new concept has emerged, and a new model will evolve from the
current nearest sample to the pool to store the knowledge of the concept.
Simultaneously, the elimination mechanism will enable outdated knowledge to be
cleared to ensure the prediction effect of the forecasters. Experiments on
different architectural models and eight real datasets demonstrate that CEP
effectively retains the knowledge of different concepts. In the scenario of
online forecasting with recurring concepts, CEP significantly enhances the
prediction results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何在不重新训练或微调PLM的情况下，通过简单的dropout注入提升零样本预测性能。

Method: 在推理时向PLM的嵌入层和转换器之间注入dropout层（如0.1的dropout率），并通过蒙特卡洛dropout方法平均输出。

Result: 在ProteinGym数据集子集上，该方法显著提高了零样本预测性能。

Conclusion: 即使PLM未在训练中使用dropout，推理时注入dropout仍能有效提升性能，且无需额外训练或微调。

Abstract: Protein Language Models (PLMs) such as ESM2 have been shown to be capable of
zero-shot prediction of critical scalar properties of proteins (fitness). In
this work, we show that injecting a dropout layer at inference time between a
PLM's featurizer/embedding layer and its transformer, and averaging its output
akin to Monte-Carlo dropout increases zero-shot performance on a subset of the
ProteinGym dataset. This is the case even when the model was not trained with
dropouts to begin with, and does not require retraining or finetuning of the
PLM. A dropout of 0.1 seems performant across all models.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“Assembly-of-Experts”（AoE）的新方法，用于高效创建混合专家模型的子模型，显著降低了计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练大型语言模型（LLM）的计算成本极高（10^13-10^15 FLOPs），效率低下。为了充分利用预训练模型的资源，需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 通过AoE方法，线性时间内从父模型生成子模型，通过权重张量插值调整语义特征。

Result: 生成的子模型功能强大且稳定，DeepSeek R1T“Chimera”模型在继承R1模型智能的同时，减少了40%的输出令牌，推理更紧凑有序。

Conclusion: AoE方法高效且实用，能够在不微调或蒸馏的情况下生成高性能子模型。

Abstract: Requiring $10^{13}$-$10^{15}$ FLOPs to calculate one 8 bit weight in an LLM
during pretraining is extremely expensive and seems inefficient. To better
leverage the huge investments made into pretrained models, we develop the new
"Assembly-of-Experts" (AoE) construction method to create capable child
variants of existing Mixture-of-Experts parent models in linear time. Model
weight tensors get interpolated individually, allowing to enhance or suppress
semantic features of the parents.
  Varying the proportion of weights taken from the parent models, we observe
some properties of the AoE child model changing gradually, while other
behavioral traits emerge with a sharp transition. Surprisingly, nearly every
generated model is functional and capable, which makes searching the model
space straightforward.
  We construct the DeepSeek R1T "Chimera", a 671B open-weights hybrid model
combining DeepSeek's V3-0324 and R1 model variants. The child inherits only the
routed expert tensors of R1, but still achieves about R1-level intelligence. At
the same time, it uses about 40\% fewer output tokens, close to V3 speed.
Constructed without any fine-tuning or distillation, the Chimera exhibits
surprisingly compact, orderly reasoning compared to its parent models.

Motivation: 探讨智能系统如何在支持广泛泛化的同时保持输入身份的选择性，揭示这种权衡的基本限制。

Method: 通过理论推导和实验验证，分析了有限语义分辨率下模型的广义化和识别能力，并扩展到噪声和异构空间。

Result: 发现多输入处理能力的急剧下降和非单调最优解，实验验证了理论在简单和复杂模型中的普适性。

Conclusion: 有限分辨率相似性是深层网络和大脑表示能力的基本约束，为广义化与识别的权衡提供了精确理论。

Abstract: Intelligent systems must deploy internal representations that are
simultaneously structured -- to support broad generalization -- and selective
-- to preserve input identity. We expose a fundamental limit on this tradeoff.
For any model whose representational similarity between inputs decays with
finite semantic resolution $\varepsilon$, we derive closed-form expressions
that pin its probability of correct generalization $p_S$ and identification
$p_I$ to a universal Pareto front independent of input space geometry.
Extending the analysis to noisy, heterogeneous spaces and to $n>2$ inputs
predicts a sharp $1/n$ collapse of multi-input processing capacity and a
non-monotonic optimum for $p_S$. A minimal ReLU network trained end-to-end
reproduces these laws: during learning a resolution boundary self-organizes and
empirical $(p_S,p_I)$ trajectories closely follow theoretical curves for
linearly decaying similarity. Finally, we demonstrate that the same limits
persist in two markedly more complex settings -- a convolutional neural network
and state-of-the-art vision-language models -- confirming that
finite-resolution similarity is a fundamental emergent informational
constraint, not merely a toy-model artifact. Together, these results provide an
exact theory of the generalization-identification trade-off and clarify how
semantic resolution shapes the representational capacity of deep networks and
brains alike.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer架构在时间序列预测中存在计算复杂度高的问题，ss-Mamba旨在提供一种高效且性能相当的替代方案。

Method: ss-Mamba采用选择性状态空间模型（Mamba），结合语义索引嵌入和样条KAN网络，动态捕获复杂时间特征。

Result: 实验证明ss-Mamba在准确性、鲁棒性和可解释性上优于传统Transformer模型。

Conclusion: ss-Mamba是一种高效且多功能的时间序列预测模型，适合替代传统Transformer架构。

Abstract: We propose ss-Mamba, a novel foundation model that enhances time series
forecasting by integrating semantic-aware embeddings and adaptive spline-based
temporal encoding within a selective state-space modeling framework. Building
upon the recent success of Transformer architectures, ss-Mamba adopts the Mamba
selective state space model as an efficient alternative that achieves
comparable performance while significantly reducing computational complexity
from quadratic to linear time. Semantic index embeddings, initialized from
pretrained language models, allow effective generalization to previously unseen
series through meaningful semantic priors. Additionally, spline-based
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) dynamically and interpretably capture complex
seasonalities and non-stationary temporal effects, providing a powerful
enhancement over conventional temporal feature encodings. Extensive
experimental evaluations confirm that ss-Mamba delivers superior accuracy,
robustness, and interpretability, demonstrating its capability as a versatile
and computationally efficient alternative to traditional Transformer-based
models in time-series forecasting.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种连续时间近似方法，通过分段连续微分方程为离散的Heavy-Ball动量方法建模，并显式处理离散化误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究连续微分方程是分析离散优化方法的有力工具，但目前对动量方法离散化误差的全面研究仍存在空白。

Method: 设计了一阶分段连续微分方程，通过添加补偿项显式处理离散化误差，实现对步长任意阶误差的控制。

Result: 为HB动量方法提供了连续时间模型，并应用于方向平滑性的隐式正则化和对角线性网络的隐式偏差分析。

Conclusion: 理论结果通过数值实验验证，为深度学习中的优化方法提供了新的理论工具。

Abstract: This paper establishes a continuous time approximation, a piece-wise
continuous differential equation, for the discrete Heavy-Ball (HB) momentum
method with explicit discretization error. Investigating continuous
differential equations has been a promising approach for studying the discrete
optimization methods. Despite the crucial role of momentum in gradient-based
optimization methods, the gap between the original discrete dynamics and the
continuous time approximations due to the discretization error has not been
comprehensively bridged yet. In this work, we study the HB momentum method in
continuous time while putting more focus on the discretization error to provide
additional theoretical tools to this area. In particular, we design a
first-order piece-wise continuous differential equation, where we add a number
of counter terms to account for the discretization error explicitly. As a
result, we provide a continuous time model for the HB momentum method that
allows the control of discretization error to arbitrary order of the step size.
As an application, we leverage it to find a new implicit regularization of the
directional smoothness and investigate the implicit bias of HB for diagonal
linear networks, indicating how our results can be used in deep learning. Our
theoretical findings are further supported by numerical experiments.

TL;DR: PARC框架分析视觉语言模型（VLMs）对提示变化的敏感性，发现VLMs在视觉领域对语言提示的敏感性与LLMs类似，最破坏性的提示变化会改变预期答案。InternVL2系列模型表现出色。


<details>

Motivation: 研究VLMs是否继承了LLMs对提示变化的敏感性，以确定哪些提示变化对VLMs影响最大，以及哪些模型对提示变化最不敏感。

Method: 提出PARC框架，基于三个支柱：(1)语言和视觉领域的合理提示变化，(2)具有内置保证的模型可靠性评分，(3)校准步骤以实现跨数据集和提示的分析。

Result: VLMs在视觉领域对语言提示的敏感性与LLMs类似，InternVL2系列模型表现最稳健。提示敏感性与训练数据相关。

Conclusion: PARC为分析VLMs的提示敏感性提供了有效工具，InternVL2系列模型在稳健性上表现突出。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) respond to user-crafted text prompts and visual
inputs, and are applied to numerous real-world problems. VLMs integrate visual
modalities with large language models (LLMs), which are well known to be
prompt-sensitive. Hence, it is crucial to determine whether VLMs inherit this
instability to varying prompts. We therefore investigate which prompt
variations VLMs are most sensitive to and which VLMs are most agnostic to
prompt variations. To this end, we introduce PARC (Prompt Analysis via
Reliability and Calibration), a VLM prompt sensitivity analysis framework built
on three pillars: (1) plausible prompt variations in both the language and
vision domain, (2) a novel model reliability score with built-in guarantees,
and (3) a calibration step that enables dataset- and prompt-spanning prompt
variation analysis. Regarding prompt variations, PARC's evaluation shows that
VLMs mirror LLM language prompt sensitivity in the vision domain, and most
destructive variations change the expected answer. Regarding models,
outstandingly robust VLMs among 22 evaluated models come from the InternVL2
family. We further find indications that prompt sensitivity is linked to
training data. The code will be at https://github.com/NVlabs/PARC.

Motivation: 稀疏和间歇性需求预测对供应链管理至关重要，但传统模型因零需求期频繁而准确性不足，亟需智能解决方案。

Method: 采用Model-Router框架，结合规则、LightGBM和InceptionTime路由器，动态选择最适合的预测模型。

Result: 在大规模Favorita数据集上，深度学习路由器（InceptionTime）将预测准确性提升11.8%，推理速度加快4.67倍。

Conclusion: 该框架显著减少了缺货和过剩库存，展示了智能自适应AI在优化供应链中的关键作用。

Abstract: Sparse and intermittent demand forecasting in supply chains presents a
critical challenge, as frequent zero-demand periods hinder traditional model
accuracy and impact inventory management. We propose and evaluate a
Model-Router framework that dynamically selects the most suitable forecasting
model-spanning classical, ML, and DL methods for each product based on its
unique demand pattern. By comparing rule-based, LightGBM, and InceptionTime
routers, our approach learns to assign appropriate forecasting strategies,
effectively differentiating between smooth, lumpy, or intermittent demand
regimes to optimize predictions. Experiments on the large-scale Favorita
dataset show our deep learning (Inception Time) router improves forecasting
accuracy by up to 11.8% (NWRMSLE) over strong, single-model benchmarks with
4.67x faster inference time. Ultimately, these gains in forecasting precision
will drive substantial reductions in both stockouts and wasteful excess
inventory, underscoring the critical role of intelligent, adaptive Al in
optimizing contemporary supply chain operations.

Abstract: This work introduces a growable and modular neural network architecture that
naturally avoids catastrophic forgetting and interference in continual

combination of previous policies along with its internal policy, accelerating
the learning process on the current task. Unlike previous growing neural
network approaches, we show that the number of parameters of the proposed
approach grows linearly with respect to the number of tasks, and does not
sacrifice plasticity to scale. Experiments conducted in benchmark continuous
control and visual problems reveal that the proposed approach achieves greater
knowledge transfer and performance than alternative methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DXA扫描成本高且耗时，需要一种更经济高效的替代方法。

Method: 使用3D光学图像提取的生物标志物，应用p-Laplacian回归模型和多种监督学习算法（如SVR）。

Result: p-Laplacian模型在10%训练数据下误差为ALM 13%、BMD 10%、BFP 20%；SVR在80%数据下表现最佳（ALM和BMD误差8%，BFP误差11%）。

Conclusion: p-Laplacian模型在数据受限的医疗环境中具有潜力。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of anthropometric body composition variables, such as
Appendicular Lean Mass (ALM), Body Fat Percentage (BFP), and Bone Mineral
Density (BMD), is essential for early diagnosis of several chronic diseases.
Currently, researchers rely on Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) scans to
measure these metrics; however, DXA scans are costly and time-consuming. This
work proposes an alternative to DXA scans by applying statistical and machine
learning models on biomarkers (height, volume, left calf circumference, etc)
obtained from 3D optical images. The dataset consists of 847 patients and was
sourced from Pennington Biomedical Research Center. Extracting patients' data
in healthcare faces many technical challenges and legal restrictions. However,
most supervised machine learning algorithms are inherently data-intensive,
requiring a large amount of training data. To overcome these limitations, we
implemented a semi-supervised model, the $p$-Laplacian regression model. This
paper is the first to demonstrate the application of a $p$-Laplacian model for
regression. Our $p$-Laplacian model yielded errors of $\sim13\%$ for ALM,
$\sim10\%$ for BMD, and $\sim20\%$ for BFP when the training data accounted for
10 percent of all data. Among the supervised algorithms we implemented, Support
Vector Regression (SVR) performed the best for ALM and BMD, yielding errors of
$\sim 8\%$ for both, while Least Squares SVR performed the best for BFP with
$\sim 11\%$ error when trained on 80 percent of the data. Our findings position
the $p$-Laplacian model as a promising tool for healthcare applications,
particularly in a data-constrained environment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大模型在推理能力上取得进展，视觉语言模型在详细视觉推理上仍有困难，尤其是在计算资源有限时。

Method: 采用Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)训练小规模模型，结合简单奖励结构、简化工具调用接口、额外分配工具调用结果令牌，以及侧重视觉困难样本的训练数据。

Result: 在部分视觉问答任务上，该方法优于同规模基线模型，得益于外部工具提供的详细视觉信息。

Conclusion: 通过GRPO和外部工具的结合，小规模视觉语言模型在详细视觉推理任务上表现更优。

Abstract: Despite tremendous recent advances in large model reasoning ability,
vision-language models (VLMs) still struggle with detailed visual reasoning,
especially when compute resources are limited. To address this challenge, we
draw inspiration from methods like Deepseek-r1 for VLMs and train smaller-scale
models with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to use external tools
such as zoom. The greatest benefit is obtained with a combination of GRPO
learning, a simple reward structure, a simplified tool-calling interface,
allocating additional tokens to the result of the tool call, and a training
data mix that over-represents visually difficult examples. Compared to
similarly-sized baseline models, our method achieves better performance on some
visual question-answering (VQA) tasks, thanks to the detailed visual
information gathered from the external tool.

Conclusion: 先进的代理模型（如DGP）是高效、稳健材料设计的强大工具。

Abstract: Surrogate modeling techniques have become indispensable in accelerating the
discovery and optimization of high-entropy alloys(HEAs), especially when
integrating computational predictions with sparse experimental observations.
This study systematically evaluates the fitting performance of four prominent
surrogate models conventional Gaussian Processes(cGP), Deep Gaussian
Processes(DGP), encoder-decoder neural networks for multi-output regression and
XGBoost applied to a hybrid dataset of experimental and computational
properties in the AlCoCrCuFeMnNiV HEA system. We specifically assess their
capabilities in predicting correlated material properties, including yield
strength, hardness, modulus, ultimate tensile strength, elongation, and average
hardness under dynamic and quasi-static conditions, alongside auxiliary
computational properties. The comparison highlights the strengths of
hierarchical and deep modeling approaches in handling heteroscedastic,
heterotopic, and incomplete data commonly encountered in materials informatics.
Our findings illustrate that DGP infused with machine learning-based prior
outperform other surrogates by effectively capturing inter-property
correlations and input-dependent uncertainty. This enhanced predictive accuracy
positions advanced surrogate models as powerful tools for robust and
data-efficient materials design.

Motivation: SSD健康状态预测对数据可靠性至关重要，传统模型存在泛化瓶颈，需改进。

Method: 结合BiGRU的双向时序建模和多头注意力机制动态分配特征权重，提取关键健康指标。

Result: 训练集和测试集分类准确率分别为92.70%和92.44%，AUC为0.94，泛化能力优异。

Conclusion: 该模型为SSD健康预测提供了新方法，可降低数据丢失风险并优化维护成本，适用于云计算和边缘存储。

Abstract: Aiming at the critical role of SSD health state prediction in data
reliability assurance, this study proposes a hybrid BiGRU-MHA model that
incorporates a multi-head attention mechanism to enhance the accuracy and
stability of storage device health classification. The model innovatively
integrates temporal feature extraction and key information focusing
capabilities. Specifically, it leverages the bidirectional timing modeling
advantages of the BiGRU network to capture both forward and backward
dependencies of SSD degradation features. Simultaneously, the multi-head
attention mechanism dynamically assigns feature weights, improving the model's
sensitivity to critical health indicators. Experimental results show that the
proposed model achieves classification accuracies of 92.70% on the training set
and 92.44% on the test set, with a minimal performance gap of only 0.26%,
demonstrating excellent generalization ability. Further analysis using the
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve shows an area under the curve
(AUC) of 0.94 on the test set, confirming the model's robust binary
classification performance. This work not only presents a new technical
approach for SSD health prediction but also addresses the generalization
bottleneck of traditional models, offering a verifiable method with practical
value for preventive maintenance of industrial-grade storage systems. The
results show the model can significantly reduce data loss risks by providing
early failure warnings and help optimize maintenance costs, supporting
intelligent decision-making in building reliable storage systems for cloud
computing data centers and edge storage environments.

Result: CACTUS优于标准ML模型，能识别关键因素并提供结果可信度，与现有医学知识一致。

Conclusion: CACTUS通过消除无关或偏见数据，为临床决策提供支持，并促进临床反馈和偏见修正。

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) is used to tackle various tasks, such as disease
classification and prediction. The effectiveness of ML models relies heavily on
having large amounts of complete data. However, healthcare data is often
limited or incomplete, which can hinder model performance. Additionally, issues
like the trustworthiness of solutions vary with the datasets used. The lack of
transparency in some ML models further complicates their understanding and use.
In healthcare, particularly in the case of Age-related Macular Degeneration
(AMD), which affects millions of older adults, early diagnosis is crucial due
to the absence of effective treatments for reversing progression. Diagnosing
AMD involves assessing retinal images along with patients' symptom reports.
There is a need for classification approaches that consider genetic, dietary,
clinical, and demographic factors. Recently, we introduced the -Comprehensive
Abstraction and Classification Tool for Uncovering Structures-(CACTUS), aimed
at improving AMD stage classification. CACTUS offers explainability and
flexibility, outperforming standard ML models. It enhances decision-making by
identifying key factors and providing confidence in its results. The important
features identified by CACTUS allow us to compare with existing medical
knowledge. By eliminating less relevant or biased data, we created a clinical
scenario for clinicians to offer feedback and address biases.

Conclusion: GRKneg在小规模一类分类中表现优异，尤其在负样本稀缺时效果显著。

Abstract: This paper focuses on small-scale one-class classification with some negative
samples available. We propose Generalized Reference Kernel with Negative
Samples (GRKneg) for One-class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM). We study
different ways to select/generate the reference vectors and recommend an
approach for the problem at hand. It is worth noting that the proposed method
does not use any labels in the model optimization but uses the original OC-SVM
implementation. Only the kernel used in the process is improved using the
negative data. We compare our method with the standard OC-SVM and with the
binary Support Vector Machine (SVM) using different amounts of negative
samples. Our approach consistently outperforms the standard OC-SVM using Radial
Basis Function kernel. When there are plenty of negative samples, the binary
SVM outperforms the one-class approaches as expected, but we show that for the
lowest numbers of negative samples the proposed approach clearly outperforms
the binary SVM.

Result: 框架在非平稳数据下更稳定，显著降低通信和计算成本。

Conclusion: 事件驱动的在线VFL框架有效解决了异步数据流和非凸模型问题。

Abstract: Online learning is more adaptable to real-world scenarios in Vertical
Federated Learning (VFL) compared to offline learning. However, integrating
online learning into VFL presents challenges due to the unique nature of VFL,
where clients possess non-intersecting feature sets for the same sample. In
real-world scenarios, the clients may not receive data streaming for the
disjoint features for the same entity synchronously. Instead, the data are
typically generated by an \emph{event} relevant to only a subset of clients. We
are the first to identify these challenges in online VFL, which have been
overlooked by previous research. To address these challenges, we proposed an
event-driven online VFL framework. In this framework, only a subset of clients
were activated during each event, while the remaining clients passively
collaborated in the learning process. Furthermore, we incorporated
\emph{dynamic local regret (DLR)} into VFL to address the challenges posed by
online learning problems with non-convex models within a non-stationary
environment. We conducted a comprehensive regret analysis of our proposed
framework, specifically examining the DLR under non-convex conditions with
event-driven online VFL. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our proposed
framework was more stable than the existing online VFL framework under
non-stationary data conditions while also significantly reducing communication
and computation costs.

Result: 实验结果显示FedOne显著提升了查询效率，与理论分析一致。

Conclusion: FedOne是一种高效的联邦黑盒离散提示学习方法，适用于云端大语言模型交互场景。

Abstract: Black-Box Discrete Prompt Learning is a prompt-tuning method that optimizes
discrete prompts without accessing model parameters or gradients, making the
prompt tuning on a cloud-based Large Language Model (LLM) feasible. Adapting
federated learning to BDPL could further enhance prompt tuning performance by
leveraging data from diverse sources. However, all previous research on
federated black-box prompt tuning had neglected the substantial query cost
associated with the cloud-based LLM service. To address this gap, we conducted
a theoretical analysis of query efficiency within the context of federated
black-box prompt tuning. Our findings revealed that degrading FedAvg to
activate only one client per round, a strategy we called \textit{FedOne},
enabled optimal query efficiency in federated black-box prompt learning.
Building on this insight, we proposed the FedOne framework, a federated
black-box discrete prompt learning method designed to maximize query efficiency
when interacting with cloud-based LLMs. We conducted numerical experiments on
various aspects of our framework, demonstrating a significant improvement in
query efficiency, which aligns with our theoretical results.

Abstract: Currently, digital security mechanisms like Anomaly Detection Systems using
Autoencoders (AE) show great potential for bypassing problems intrinsic to the
data, such as data imbalance. Because AE use a non-trivial and nonstandardized
separation threshold to classify the extracted reconstruction error, the
definition of this threshold directly impacts the performance of the detection
process. Thus, this work proposes the automatic definition of this threshold
using some machine learning algorithms. For this, three algorithms were
evaluated: the K-Nearst Neighbors, the K-Means and the Support Vector Machine.

Abstract: The loss landscapes of neural networks contain minima and saddle points that
may be connected in flat regions or appear in isolation. We identify and
characterize a special structure in the loss landscape: channels along which
the loss decreases extremely slowly, while the output weights of at least two
neurons, $a_i$ and $a_j$, diverge to $\pm$infinity, and their input weight
vectors, $\mathbf{w_i}$ and $\mathbf{w_j}$, become equal to each other. At
convergence, the two neurons implement a gated linear unit:
$a_i\sigma(\mathbf{w_i} \cdot \mathbf{x}) + a_j\sigma(\mathbf{w_j} \cdot
\mathbf{x}) \rightarrow \sigma(\mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x}) + (\mathbf{v} \cdot
\mathbf{x}) \sigma'(\mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x})$. Geometrically, these
channels to infinity are asymptotically parallel to symmetry-induced lines of
critical points. Gradient flow solvers, and related optimization methods like
SGD or ADAM, reach the channels with high probability in diverse regression
settings, but without careful inspection they look like flat local minima with
finite parameter values. Our characterization provides a comprehensive picture
of these quasi-flat regions in terms of gradient dynamics, geometry, and
functional interpretation. The emergence of gated linear units at the end of
the channels highlights a surprising aspect of the computational capabilities
of fully connected layers.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach to improve

math and code, limiting our understanding of its broader applicability to
general reasoning. A key challenge lies in the lack of reliable, scalable RL
reward signals across diverse reasoning domains. We introduce Guru, a curated
RL reasoning corpus of 92K verifiable examples spanning six reasoning
domains--Math, Code, Science, Logic, Simulation, and Tabular--each built
through domain-specific reward design, deduplication, and filtering to ensure
reliability and effectiveness for RL training. Based on Guru, we systematically
revisit established findings in RL for LLM reasoning and observe significant
variation across domains. For example, while prior work suggests that RL
primarily elicits existing knowledge from pretrained models, our results reveal
a more nuanced pattern: domains frequently seen during pretraining (Math, Code,
Science) easily benefit from cross-domain RL training, while domains with
limited pretraining exposure (Logic, Simulation, and Tabular) require in-domain
training to achieve meaningful performance gains, suggesting that RL is likely
to facilitate genuine skill acquisition. Finally, we present Guru-7B and
Guru-32B, two models that achieve state-of-the-art performance among open
models RL-trained with publicly available data, outperforming best baselines by
7.9% and 6.7% on our 17-task evaluation suite across six reasoning domains. We
also show that our models effectively improve the Pass@k performance of their
base models, particularly on complex tasks less likely to appear in pretraining
data. We release data, models, training and evaluation code to facilitate
general-purpose reasoning at: https://github.com/LLM360/Reasoning360

### [160] [ODD: Overlap-aware Estimation of Model Performance under Distribution Shift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14978)
*Aayush Mishra,Anqi Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的误差估计方法（ODD），解决了现有方法（DIS²）在重叠区域竞争的问题，通过仅关注非重叠目标域的分歧，提高了性能估计的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法DIS²在估计ML模型在未见测试域中的误差时存在重叠区域竞争问题，导致估计不够准确。

Method: 提出Overlap-aware Disagreement Discrepancy (ODD)，利用域分类器估计域重叠，仅最大化非重叠目标域的分歧。

Result: 实验表明，ODD在多个基准测试中比DIS²更准确地预测目标性能，同时保持有效性和可靠性。

Conclusion: ODD方法通过消除重叠区域的竞争，显著提升了误差估计的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Reliable and accurate estimation of the error of an ML model in unseen test
domains is an important problem for safe intelligent systems. Prior work uses
disagreement discrepancy (DIS^2) to derive practical error bounds under
distribution shifts. It optimizes for a maximally disagreeing classifier on the
target domain to bound the error of a given source classifier. Although this
approach offers a reliable and competitively accurate estimate of the target
error, we identify a problem in this approach which causes the disagreement
discrepancy objective to compete in the overlapping region between source and
target domains. With an intuitive assumption that the target disagreement
should be no more than the source disagreement in the overlapping region due to
high enough support, we devise Overlap-aware Disagreement Discrepancy (ODD).
Maximizing ODD only requires disagreement in the non-overlapping target domain,
removing the competition. Our ODD-based bound uses domain-classifiers to
estimate domain-overlap and better predicts target performance than DIS^2. We
conduct experiments on a wide array of benchmarks to show that our method
improves the overall performance-estimation error while remaining valid and
reliable. Our code and results are available on GitHub.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being adopted as the cognitive
core of embodied agents. However, inherited hallucinations, which stem from
failures to ground user instructions in the observed physical environment, can
lead to navigation errors, such as searching for a refrigerator that does not
exist. In this paper, we present the first systematic study of hallucinations
in LLM-based embodied agents performing long-horizon tasks under scene-task
inconsistencies. Our goal is to understand to what extent hallucinations occur,
what types of inconsistencies trigger them, and how current models respond. To
achieve these goals, we construct a hallucination probing set by building on an
existing benchmark, capable of inducing hallucination rates up to 40x higher
than base prompts. Evaluating 12 models across two simulation environments, we
find that while models exhibit reasoning, they fail to resolve scene-task
inconsistencies-highlighting fundamental limitations in handling infeasible
tasks. We also provide actionable insights on ideal model behavior for each
scenario, offering guidance for developing more robust and reliable planning
strategies.

Conclusion: 研究展示了基础模型和多模态方法在复杂临床和数字数据中的潜力，有望提高MS及其他复杂疾病的预后准确性。

Abstract: Early multiple sclerosis (MS) disability progression prediction is
challenging due to disease heterogeneity. This work predicts 48- and 72-week
disability using sparse baseline clinical data and 12 weeks of daily digital
Floodlight data from the CONSONANCE clinical trial. We employed
state-of-the-art tabular and time-series foundation models (FMs), a custom
multimodal attention-based transformer, and machine learning methods. Despite
the difficulty of early prediction (AUROC 0.63), integrating digital data via
advanced models improved performance over clinical data alone. A transformer
model using unimodal embeddings from the Moment FM yielded the best result, but
our multimodal transformer consistently outperformed its unimodal counterpart,
confirming the advantages of combining clinical with digital data. Our findings
demonstrate the promise of FMs and multimodal approaches to extract predictive
signals from complex and diverse clinical and digital life sciences data (e.g.,
imaging, omics), enabling more accurate prognostics for MS and potentially
other complex diseases.

Abstract: We propose a multi-agent multi-armed bandit (MA-MAB) framework aimed at
ensuring fair outcomes across agents while maximizing overall system
performance. A key challenge in this setting is decision-making under limited
information about arm rewards. To address this, we introduce a novel probing
framework that strategically gathers information about selected arms before
allocation. In the offline setting, where reward distributions are known, we
leverage submodular properties to design a greedy probing algorithm with a
provable performance bound. For the more complex online setting, we develop an
algorithm that achieves sublinear regret while maintaining fairness. Extensive
experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that our approach
outperforms baseline methods, achieving better fairness and efficiency.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法在脓毒症治疗的强化学习中忽略了训练不稳定性对策略性能的负面影响，需解决这一问题以提升临床效果。

Method: 通过控制微分方程（CDE）学习状态表示，结合早期停止或稳定化方法确保训练稳定性，并通过与临床评分（SOFA、SAPS-II、OASIS）的相关性正则化增强表示。

Result: 实验显示稳定CDE表示能生成与临床评分强相关的表示，并实现高性能强化学习策略（WIS回报>0.9），而不稳定表示导致策略失败（WIS回报~0）。

Conclusion: 研究为临床强化学习中不规则时间序列的表示学习提供了实用指南，强调训练稳定性对成功策略的关键作用。

Abstract: Effective reinforcement learning (RL) for sepsis treatment depends on
learning stable, clinically meaningful state representations from irregular ICU
time series. While previous works have explored representation learning for
this task, the critical challenge of training instability in sequential
representations and its detrimental impact on policy performance has been
overlooked. This work demonstrates that Controlled Differential Equations (CDE)
state representation can achieve strong RL policies when two key factors are
met: (1) ensuring training stability through early stopping or stabilization
methods, and (2) enforcing acuity-aware representations by correlation
regularization with clinical scores (SOFA, SAPS-II, OASIS). Experiments on the
MIMIC-III sepsis cohort reveal that stable CDE autoencoder produces
representations strongly correlated with acuity scores and enables RL policies
with superior performance (WIS return $> 0.9$). In contrast, unstable CDE
representation leads to degraded representations and policy failure (WIS return
$\sim$ 0). Visualizations of the latent space show that stable CDEs not only
separate survivor and non-survivor trajectories but also reveal clear acuity
score gradients, whereas unstable training fails to capture either pattern.
These findings highlight practical guidelines for using CDEs to encode
irregular medical time series in clinical RL, emphasizing the need for training
stability in sequential representation learning.

Conclusion: SFT-GO通过自适应强调关键令牌，提升了模型的学习动态和性能，具有鲁棒性和有效性。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) has become an essential step in tailoring large
language models (LLMs) to align with human expectations and specific downstream
tasks. However, existing SFT methods typically treat each training instance as
a uniform sequence, giving equal importance to all tokens regardless of their
relevance. This overlooks the fact that only a subset of tokens often contains
critical, task-specific information. To address this limitation, we introduce
Supervised Fine-Tuning with Group Optimization (SFT-GO), a novel approach that
treats groups of tokens differently based on their importance.SFT-GO groups
tokens in each sample based on their importance values and optimizes the LLM
using a weighted combination of the worst-group loss and the standard
cross-entropy loss. This mechanism adaptively emphasizes the most challenging
token groups and guides the model to better handle different group
distributions, thereby improving overall learning dynamics. We provide a
theoretical analysis of SFT-GO's convergence rate, demonstrating its
efficiency. Empirically, we apply SFT-GO with three different token grouping
strategies and show that models trained with SFT-GO consistently outperform
baseline approaches across popular LLM benchmarks. These improvements hold
across various datasets and base models, demonstrating the robustness and the
effectiveness of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Pretraining large language models is a costly process. To make this process
more efficient, several methods have been proposed to optimize model
architecture/parametrization and hardware use. On the parametrization side,
$\mu P$ (Maximal Update Parametrization) parametrizes model weights and
learning rate (LR) in a way that makes hyperparameters (HPs) transferable with
width (embedding dimension): HPs can be tuned for a small model and used for
larger models without additional tuning. While $\mu$P showed impressive results
in practice, recent empirical studies have reported conflicting observations
when applied to LLMs. One limitation of the theory behind $\mu$P is the fact
that input dimension (vocabulary size in LLMs) is considered fixed when taking
the width to infinity. This is unrealistic since vocabulary size is generally
much larger than width in practice. In this work, we provide a theoretical
analysis of the effect of vocabulary size on training dynamics, and
subsequently show that as vocabulary size increases, the training dynamics
\emph{interpolate between the $\mu$P regime and another regime that we call
Large Vocab (LV) Regime}, where optimal scaling rules are different from those
predicted by $\mu$P. Our analysis reveals that in the LV regime, the optimal
embedding LR to hidden LR ratio should roughly scale as $\Theta(\sqrt{width})$,
surprisingly close to the empirical findings previously reported in the
literature, and different from the $\Theta(width)$ ratio predicted by $\mu$P.
We conduct several experiments to validate our theory, and pretrain a 1B model
from scratch to show the benefit of our suggested scaling rule for the
embedding LR.

Conclusion: SPG是一种高效、轻量级的超参数优化方法，具有广泛的工业应用潜力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning is essential for neural architecture search and
hyperparameter optimization, but the conventional approaches impede widespread
use due to prohibitive time and computational costs. Inspired by DeepSeek-V3
multi-token prediction architecture, we propose Sequential Policy Gradient
modeling (SPG), a novel trajectory generation paradigm for lightweight online
hyperparameter optimization. In contrast to conventional policy gradient
methods, SPG extends the base model with temporary modules, enabling it to
generate state-action (padded) trajectories in a single forward pass. Our
experiments demonstrate that models gain performance when retrained with SPG on
their original datasets and also outperform standard transfer fine-tuning. We
evaluate on five datasets spanning computer vision (ImageNet, COCO), natural
language processing (GLUE, SQuAD), and audio (SUPERB) to assess the industrial
applicability of SPG. The proposed method demonstrates consistent improvements
across widely adopted models, achieving performance gains of $+0.2\sim7\%$,
with significantly low computational costs. Fully reproducible code and

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The pursuit of faster optimization algorithms remains an active and important
research direction in deep learning. Recently, the Muon optimizer [JJB+24] has
demonstrated promising empirical performance, but its theoretical foundation
remains less understood. In this paper, we bridge this gap and provide a
theoretical analysis of Muon by placing it within the Lion-$\mathcal{K}$ family
of optimizers [CLLL24]. Specifically, we show that Muon corresponds to
Lion-$\mathcal{K}$ when equipped with the nuclear norm, and we leverage the
theoretical results of Lion-$\mathcal{K}$ to establish that Muon (with
decoupled weight decay) implicitly solves an optimization problem that enforces
a constraint on the spectral norm of weight matrices. This perspective not only
demystifies the implicit regularization effects of Muon but also leads to
natural generalizations through varying the choice of convex map $\mathcal{K}$,
allowing for the exploration of a broader class of implicitly regularized and
constrained optimization algorithms.

Result: 在多个基准问题上验证了框架的有效性，显著提升了模型精度。

Conclusion: HiPreNets框架通过渐进式训练和残差优化，有效解决了高精度神经网络训练的挑战。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are powerful tools for solving nonlinear problems in
science and engineering, but training highly accurate models becomes
challenging as problem complexity increases. Non-convex optimization and
numerous hyperparameters to tune make performance improvement difficult, and
traditional approaches often prioritize minimizing mean squared error (MSE)
while overlooking $L^{\infty}$ error, which is the critical focus in many
applications. To address these challenges, we present a progressive framework
for training and tuning high-precision neural networks (HiPreNets). Our
approach refines a previously explored staged training technique for neural
networks that improves an existing fully connected neural network by
sequentially learning its prediction residuals using additional networks,
leading to improved overall accuracy. We discuss how to take advantage of the
structure of the residuals to guide the choice of loss function, number of
parameters to use, and ways to introduce adaptive data sampling techniques. We
validate our framework's effectiveness through several benchmark problems.

Abstract: Modern intelligent transportation systems rely on accurate spatiotemporal
traffic analysis to optimize urban mobility and infrastructure resilience.
However, pervasive missing data caused by sensor failures and heterogeneous
sensing gaps fundamentally hinders reliable traffic modeling. This paper
proposes a Neural Canonical Polyadic Factorization (NCPF) model that synergizes
low-rank tensor algebra with deep representation learning for robust traffic
data imputation. The model innovatively embeds CP decomposition into neural
architecture through learnable embedding projections, where sparse traffic
tensors are encoded into dense latent factors across road segments, time
intervals, and mobility metrics. A hierarchical feature fusion mechanism
employs Hadamard products to explicitly model multilinear interactions, while
stacked multilayer perceptron layers nonlinearly refine these representations
to capture complex spatiotemporal couplings. Extensive evaluations on six urban
traffic datasets demonstrate NCPF's superiority over six state-of-the-art
baselines. By unifying CP decomposition's interpretable factor analysis with
neural network's nonlinear expressive power, NCPF provides a principled yet
flexible approaches for high-dimensional traffic data imputation, offering
critical support for next-generation transportation digital twins and adaptive
traffic control systems.

Abstract: With growing demands for privacy protection, security, and legal compliance
(e.g., GDPR), machine unlearning has emerged as a critical technique for
ensuring the controllability and regulatory alignment of machine learning
models. However, a fundamental challenge in this field lies in effectively
verifying whether unlearning operations have been successfully and thoroughly
executed. Despite a growing body of work on unlearning techniques, verification
methodologies remain comparatively underexplored and often fragmented. Existing
approaches lack a unified taxonomy and a systematic framework for evaluation.
To bridge this gap, this paper presents the first structured survey of machine
unlearning verification methods. We propose a taxonomy that organizes current
techniques into two principal categories -- behavioral verification and
parametric verification -- based on the type of evidence used to assess
unlearning fidelity. We examine representative methods within each category,
analyze their underlying assumptions, strengths, and limitations, and identify
potential vulnerabilities in practical deployment. In closing, we articulate a
set of open problems in current verification research, aiming to provide a
foundation for developing more robust, efficient, and theoretically grounded
unlearning verification mechanisms.

Conclusion: ImprovDML在隐私保护、拜占庭鲁棒性和模型精度之间实现了更好的权衡，数值模拟验证了理论结果。

Abstract: Jointly addressing Byzantine attacks and privacy leakage in distributed
machine learning (DML) has become an important issue. A common strategy
involves integrating Byzantine-resilient aggregation rules with differential
privacy mechanisms. However, the incorporation of these techniques often
results in a significant degradation in model accuracy. To address this issue,
we propose a decentralized DML framework, named ImprovDML, that achieves high
model accuracy while simultaneously ensuring privacy preservation and
resilience to Byzantine attacks. The framework leverages a kind of resilient
vector consensus algorithms that can compute a point within the normal
(non-Byzantine) agents' convex hull for resilient aggregation at each
iteration. Then, multivariate Gaussian noises are introduced to the gradients
for privacy preservation. We provide convergence guarantees and derive
asymptotic learning error bounds under non-convex settings, which are tighter
than those reported in existing works. For the privacy analysis, we adopt the
notion of concentrated geo-privacy, which quantifies privacy preservation based
on the Euclidean distance between inputs. We demonstrate that it enables an
improved trade-off between privacy preservation and model accuracy compared to
differential privacy. Finally, numerical simulations validate our theoretical
results.

Conclusion: SKIL方法为复杂动物行为的生成提供了简洁且原则性的解释，展示了从基本运动原语动态组合的潜力。

Abstract: Animals flexibly recombine a finite set of core motor primitives to meet
diverse task demands, but existing behavior-segmentation methods oversimplify
this process by imposing discrete syllables under restrictive generative
assumptions. To reflect the animal behavior generation procedure, we introduce
skill-based imitation learning (SKIL) for behavior understanding, a
reinforcement learning-based imitation framework that (1) infers interpretable
skill sets, i.e., latent basis functions of behavior, by leveraging
representation learning on transition probabilities, and (2) parameterizes
policies as dynamic mixtures of these skills. We validate our approach on a
simple grid world, a discrete labyrinth, and unconstrained videos of freely
moving animals. Across tasks, it identifies reusable skill components, learns
continuously evolving compositional policies, and generates realistic
trajectories beyond the capabilities of traditional discrete models. By
exploiting generative behavior modeling with compositional representations, our
method offers a concise, principled account of how complex animal behaviors
emerge from dynamic combinations of fundamental motor primitives.

Abstract: While there are many applications of ML to scientific problems that look
promising, visuals can be deceiving. For scientific applications, actual
quantitative accuracy is crucial. This work applies the rigor of numerical
analysis for differential equations to machine learning by specifically
quantifying the accuracy of applying different ML techniques to the elementary
1D Poisson differential equation. Beyond the quantity and discretization of
data, we identify that the function space of the data is critical to the
generalization of the model. We prove generalization bounds and convergence
rates under finite data discretizations and restricted training data subspaces
by analyzing the training dynamics and deriving optimal parameters for both a
white-box differential equation discovery method and a black-box linear model.
The analytically derived generalization bounds are replicated empirically.
Similar lack of generalization is empirically demonstrated for deep linear
models, shallow neural networks, and physics-specific DeepONets and Neural
Operators. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that generalization to
the true physical equation is not guaranteed in each explored case.
Surprisingly, we find that different classes of models can exhibit opposing
generalization behaviors. Based on our theoretical analysis, we also
demonstrate a new mechanistic interpretability lens on scientific models
whereby Green's function representations can be extracted from the weights of
black-box models. Our results inform a new cross-validation technique for
measuring generalization in physical systems. We propose applying it to the
Poisson equation as an evaluation benchmark of future methods.

diverse language and reasoning tasks, but full fine-tuning incurs substantial
storage, memory, and computational overhead. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) methods mitigate these costs by learning only a small subset of
task-specific parameters, yet existing approaches either introduce
inference-time latency (adapter modules), suffer from suboptimal convergence
(randomly initialized low-rank updates), or rely on fixed rank choices that may
not match task complexity (Kronecker-based decompositions).
  We propose SoKA (SVD on Kronecker Adaptation), a novel PEFT strategy that
combines Kronecker-product tensor factorization with SVD-driven initialization
and spectrum-aware dynamic rank selection. Our Kronecker-Product SVD (KPSVD)
procedure extracts principal components of the full weight update into compact
Kronecker factors, while an adaptive rank selection algorithm uses
energy-threshold and elbow-point criteria to prune negligible components.
  Empirical evaluation on LLaMA2-7B across arithmetic reasoning (GSM8K), formal
mathematics (MATH), and code generation (MBPP) demonstrates that SoKA requires
only 0.99M trainable parameters, 25% fewer than LoRA/PiSSA, while matching or
exceeding baseline performance. Moreover, SoKA exhibits faster convergence and
more stable gradients, highlighting its robustness and efficiency for
large-scale model adaptation.

Abstract: Federated learning allows each client to keep its data locally when training
machine learning models in a distributed setting. Significant recent research
established the requirements that the input must satisfy in order to guarantee
convergence of the training loop. This line of work uses averaging as the
aggregation rule for the training models. In particular, we are interested in
whether federated learning is robust to Byzantine behavior, and observe and
investigate a tradeoff between the average/centroid and the validity conditions
from distributed computing. We show that the various validity conditions alone
do not guarantee a good approximation of the average. Furthermore, we show that
reaching good approximation does not give good results in experimental settings
due to possible Byzantine outliers. Our main contribution is the first lower
bound of $\min\{\frac{n-t}{t},\sqrt{d}\}$ on the centroid approximation under
box validity that is often considered in the literature, where $n$ is the
number of clients, $t$ the upper bound on the number of Byzantine faults, and
$d$ is the dimension of the machine learning model. We complement this lower
bound by an upper bound of $2\min\{n,\sqrt{d}\}$, by providing a new analysis
for the case $n<d$. In addition, we present a new algorithm that achieves a
$\sqrt{2d}$-approximation under convex validity, which also proves that the
existing lower bound in the literature is tight. We show that all presented
bounds can also be achieved in the distributed peer-to-peer setting. We
complement our analytical results with empirical evaluations in federated
stochastic gradient descent and federated averaging settings.

Conclusion: 该方法为数据所有者提供了可靠的版权验证工具，适用于实际法律诉讼。

Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) can be mainly
attributed to their massive training datasets, which are often scraped from the
internet without respecting data owners' intellectual property rights. Dataset
Inference (DI) offers a potential remedy by identifying whether a suspect
dataset was used in training, thereby enabling data owners to verify
unauthorized use. However, existing DI methods require a private set-known to
be absent from training-that closely matches the compromised dataset's
distribution. Such in-distribution, held-out data is rarely available in
practice, severely limiting the applicability of DI. In this work, we address
this challenge by synthetically generating the required held-out set. Our
approach tackles two key obstacles: (1) creating high-quality, diverse
synthetic data that accurately reflects the original distribution, which we
achieve via a data generator trained on a carefully designed suffix-based
completion task, and (2) bridging likelihood gaps between real and synthetic
data, which is realized through post-hoc calibration. Extensive experiments on
diverse text datasets show that using our generated data as a held-out set
enables DI to detect the original training sets with high confidence, while
maintaining a low false positive rate. This result empowers copyright owners to
make legitimate claims on data usage and demonstrates our method's reliability
for real-world litigations. Our code is available at

Motivation: 随着电动汽车普及，需要一种能同时满足城市、郊区和农村需求的充电基础设施规划工具。

Method: 方法包括数据栅格化、图神经网络中心性模型、Voronoi分割、队列模型和贪婪启发式选址。

Result: 在乔治亚州应用中，覆盖率提高12%，低收入居民充电距离减半，且满足电力容量限制。

Conclusion: DOVA-PATBM展示了多分辨率方法在学术优化与可部署政策间的桥梁作用。

Abstract: The accelerating uptake of battery-electric vehicles demands infrastructure
planning tools that are both data-rich and geographically scalable. Whereas
most prior studies optimise charging locations for single cities, state-wide
and national networks must reconcile the conflicting requirements of dense
metropolitan cores, car-dependent exurbs, and power-constrained rural
corridors.
  We present DOVA-PATBM (Deployment Optimisation with Voronoi-oriented,
Adaptive, POI-Aware Temporal Behaviour Model), a geo-computational framework
that unifies these contexts in a single pipeline. The method rasterises
heterogeneous data (roads, population, night lights, POIs, and feeder lines)
onto a hierarchical H3 grid, infers intersection importance with a
zone-normalised graph neural network centrality model, and overlays a Voronoi
tessellation that guarantees at least one five-port DC fast charger within
every 30 km radius. Hourly arrival profiles, learned from loop-detector and
floating-car traces, feed a finite M/M/c queue to size ports under
feeder-capacity and outage-risk constraints. A greedy maximal-coverage
heuristic with income-weighted penalties then selects the minimum number of
sites that satisfy coverage and equity targets.
  Applied to the State of Georgia, USA, DOVA-PATBM (i) increases 30 km tile
coverage by 12 percentage points, (ii) halves the mean distance that low-income
residents travel to the nearest charger, and (iii) meets sub-transmission
headroom everywhere -- all while remaining computationally tractable for
national-scale roll-outs. These results demonstrate that a tightly integrated,
GNN-driven, multi-resolution approach can bridge the gap between academic
optimisation and deployable infrastructure policy.

Conclusion: 该研究是生成式AI在跨境电子商务供应链金融风险管理中的首创应用，为提升信用实践和中小企业融资提供了基础。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of cross-border e-commerce (CBEC) has created significant
opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), yet financing
remains a critical challenge due to SMEs' limited credit histories. Third-party
logistics (3PL)-led supply chain finance (SCF) has emerged as a promising
solution, leveraging in-transit inventory as collateral. We propose an advanced
credit risk management framework tailored for 3PL-led SCF, addressing the dual
challenges of credit risk assessment and loan size determination. Specifically,
we leverage conditional generative modeling of sales distributions through
Quantile-Regression-based Generative Metamodeling (QRGMM) as the foundation for
risk estimation. We propose a unified framework that enables flexible
estimation of multiple risk measures while introducing a functional risk
measure formulation that systematically captures the relationship between these
risk measures and varying loan levels, supported by theoretical guarantees. To
capture complex covariate interactions in e-commerce sales data, we integrate
QRGMM with Deep Factorization Machines (DeepFM). Extensive experiments on
synthetic and real-world data validate the efficacy of our model for credit
risk assessment and loan size determination. This study represents a pioneering
application of generative AI in CBEC SCF risk management, offering a solid
foundation for enhanced credit practices and improved SME access to capital.

Conclusion: SecFwT为隐私保护LLM微调提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed numerous fields, yet their
adaptation to specialized tasks in privacy-sensitive domains, such as
healthcare and finance, is constrained by the scarcity of accessible training
data due to stringent privacy requirements. Secure multi-party computation
(MPC)-based privacy-preserving machine learning offers a powerful approach to
protect both model parameters and user data, but its application to LLMs has
been largely limited to inference, as fine-tuning introduces significant
computational challenges, particularly in privacy-preserving backward
propagation and optimizer operations. This paper identifies two primary
obstacles to MPC-based privacy-preserving fine-tuning of LLMs: (1) the
substantial computational overhead of backward and optimizer processes, and (2)
the inefficiency of softmax-based attention mechanisms in MPC settings. To
address these challenges, we propose SecFwT, the first MPC-based framework
designed for efficient, privacy-preserving LLM fine-tuning. SecFwT introduces a
forward-only tuning paradigm to eliminate backward and optimizer computations
and employs MPC-friendly Random Feature Attention to approximate softmax
attention, significantly reducing costly non-linear operations and
computational complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that SecFwT delivers
substantial improvements in efficiency and privacy preservation, enabling
scalable and secure fine-tuning of LLMs for privacy-critical applications.

Abstract: Simultaneously optimizing molecules against multiple therapeutic targets
remains a profound challenge in drug discovery, particularly due to sparse
rewards and conflicting design constraints. We propose a structured active
learning (AL) paradigm integrating a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) variational
autoencoder (VAE) into iterative loops designed to balance chemical diversity,
molecular quality, and multi-target affinity. Our method alternates between
expanding chemically feasible regions of latent space and progressively
constraining molecules based on increasingly stringent multi-target docking
thresholds. In a proof-of-concept study targeting three related coronavirus
main proteases (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV), our approach efficiently
generated a structurally diverse set of pan-inhibitor candidates. We
demonstrate that careful timing and strategic placement of chemical filters
within this active learning pipeline markedly enhance exploration of beneficial
chemical space, transforming the sparse-reward, multi-objective drug design
problem into an accessible computational task. Our framework thus provides a
generalizable roadmap for efficiently navigating complex polypharmacological
landscapes.

Result: 多层或循环Transformer能通过隐式构造多项式有效利用未标记数据，且性能随深度指数提升。

Conclusion: 通过循环现成的表格基础模型，显著提升了半监督学习性能。

Abstract: Recent research shows that in-context learning (ICL) can be effective even
when demonstrations have missing or incorrect labels. To shed light on this
capability, we examine a canonical setting where the demonstrations are drawn
according to a binary Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and a certain fraction of
the demonstrations have missing labels. We provide a comprehensive theoretical
study to show that: (1) The loss landscape of one-layer linear attention models
recover the optimal fully-supervised estimator but completely fail to exploit
unlabeled data; (2) In contrast, multilayer or looped transformers can
effectively leverage unlabeled data by implicitly constructing estimators of
the form $\sum_{i\ge 0} a_i (X^\top X)^iX^\top y$ with $X$ and $y$ denoting
features and partially-observed labels (with missing entries set to zero). We
characterize the class of polynomials that can be expressed as a function of
depth and draw connections to Expectation Maximization, an iterative
pseudo-labeling algorithm commonly used in semi-supervised learning.
Importantly, the leading polynomial power is exponential in depth, so mild
amount of depth/looping suffices. As an application of theory, we propose
looping off-the-shelf tabular foundation models to enhance their
semi-supervision capabilities. Extensive evaluations on real-world datasets
show that our method significantly improves the semisupervised tabular learning
performance over the standard single pass inference.

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效处理了缺失值问题，提升了多项临床指标的预测性能，为早期诊断提供了新思路。

Abstract: Clinical laboratory results are ubiquitous in any diagnosis making.
Predicting abnormal values of not prescribed tests based on the results of
performed tests looks intriguing, as it would be possible to make early
diagnosis available to everyone. The special place is taken by the Common Blood
Count (CBC) test, as it is the most widely used clinical procedure. Combining
routine biochemical panels with CBC presents a set of test-value pairs that
varies from patient to patient, or, in common settings, a table with missing
values. Here we formulate a tabular modeling problem as a set translation
problem where the source set comprises pairs of GPT-like label column embedding
and its corresponding value while the target set consists of the same type
embeddings only. The proposed approach can effectively deal with missing values
without implicitly estimating them and bridges the world of LLM with the
tabular domain. Applying this method to clinical laboratory data, we achieve an
improvement up to 8% AUC for joint predictions of high uric acid, glucose,
cholesterol, and low ferritin levels.

Abstract: Neural network potentials (NNPs) offer a powerful alternative to traditional
force fields for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Accurate and stable MD
simulations, crucial for evaluating material properties, require training data
encompassing both low-energy stable structures and high-energy structures.
Conventional knowledge distillation (KD) methods fine-tune a pre-trained NNP as
a teacher model to generate training data for a student model. However, in
material-specific models, this fine-tuning process increases energy barriers,
making it difficult to create training data containing high-energy structures.
To address this, we propose a novel KD framework that leverages a
non-fine-tuned, off-the-shelf pre-trained NNP as a teacher. Its gentler energy
landscape facilitates the exploration of a wider range of structures, including
the high-energy structures crucial for stable MD simulations. Our framework
employs a two-stage training process: first, the student NNP is trained with a
dataset generated by the off-the-shelf teacher; then, it is fine-tuned with a
smaller, high-accuracy density functional theory (DFT) dataset. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our framework by applying it to both organic (polyethylene
glycol) and inorganic (L$_{10}$GeP$_{2}$S$_{12}$) materials, achieving
comparable or superior accuracy in reproducing physical properties compared to
existing methods. Importantly, our method reduces the number of expensive DFT
calculations by 10x compared to existing NNP generation methods, without
sacrificing accuracy.

Conclusion: cI²SB框架有效解决了扩散模型在FWI中的局限性，为高分辨率样本生成提供了高效且可控的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent developments in application of deep learning models to acoustic Full
Waveform Inversion (FWI) are marked by the use of diffusion models as prior
distributions for Bayesian-like inference procedures. The advantage of these
methods is the ability to generate high-resolution samples, which are otherwise
unattainable with classical inversion methods or other deep learning-based
solutions. However, the iterative and stochastic nature of sampling from
diffusion models along with heuristic nature of output control remain limiting
factors for their applicability. For instance, an optimal way to include the
approximate velocity model into diffusion-based inversion scheme remains
unclear, even though it is considered an essential part of FWI pipeline. We
address the issue by employing a Schr\"odinger Bridge that interpolates between
the distributions of ground truth and smoothed velocity models. To facilitate
the learning of nonlinear drifts that transfer samples between distributions we
extend the concept of Image-to-Image Schr\"odinger Bridge
($\text{I}^2\text{SB}$) to conditional sampling, resulting in a conditional
Image-to-Image Schr\"odinger Bridge (c$\text{I}^2\text{SB}$) framework. To
validate our method, we assess its effectiveness in reconstructing the
reference velocity model from its smoothed approximation, coupled with the
observed seismic signal of fixed shape. Our experiments demonstrate that the
proposed solution outperforms our reimplementation of conditional diffusion
model suggested in earlier works, while requiring only a few neural function
evaluations (NFEs) to achieve sample fidelity superior to that attained with
supervised learning-based approach. The supplementary code implementing the
algorithms described in this paper can be found in the repository

Conclusion: 通过结合更强的MIA方法，可以在黑盒设置下显著提升单次审计的效果，为实际应用提供更可靠的隐私保证。

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) auditing aims to provide empirical lower bounds on
the privacy guarantees of DP mechanisms like DP-SGD. While some existing
techniques require many training runs that are prohibitively costly, recent
work introduces one-run auditing approaches that effectively audit DP-SGD in
white-box settings while still being computationally efficient. However, in the
more practical black-box setting where gradients cannot be manipulated during
training and only the last model iterate is observed, prior work shows that
there is still a large gap between the empirical lower bounds and theoretical
upper bounds. Consequently, in this work, we study how incorporating approaches
for stronger membership inference attacks (MIA) can improve one-run auditing in
the black-box setting. Evaluating on image classification models trained on
CIFAR-10 with DP-SGD, we demonstrate that our proposed approach, which utilizes
quantile regression for MIA, achieves tighter bounds while crucially
maintaining the computational efficiency of one-run methods.

Conclusion: DiTMC的架构选择和对称性先验显著影响生成质量与效率，为大规模分子结构生成建模提供了新方向。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated strong performance in
generative modeling, particularly in image synthesis, making them a compelling
choice for molecular conformer generation. However, applying DiTs to molecules
introduces novel challenges, such as integrating discrete molecular graph
information with continuous 3D geometry, handling Euclidean symmetries, and
designing conditioning mechanisms that generalize across molecules of varying
sizes and structures. We propose DiTMC, a framework that adapts DiTs to address
these challenges through a modular architecture that separates the processing
of 3D coordinates from conditioning on atomic connectivity. To this end, we
introduce two complementary graph-based conditioning strategies that integrate
seamlessly with the DiT architecture. These are combined with different
attention mechanisms, including both standard non-equivariant and
SO(3)-equivariant formulations, enabling flexible control over the trade-off
between between accuracy and computational efficiency. Experiments on standard
conformer generation benchmarks (GEOM-QM9, -DRUGS, -XL) demonstrate that DiTMC
achieves state-of-the-art precision and physical validity. Our results
highlight how architectural choices and symmetry priors affect sample quality
and efficiency, suggesting promising directions for large-scale generative
modeling of molecular structures. Code available at

Conclusion: 该方法在跨疾病scRNA-seq数据中展示了有效性和可解释性。

Abstract: Optimal transport provides a robust framework for comparing probability
distributions. Its effectiveness is significantly influenced by the choice of
the underlying ground metric. Traditionally, the ground metric has either been
(i) predefined, e.g., as the Euclidean distance, or (ii) learned in a
supervised way, by utilizing labeled data to learn a suitable ground metric for
enhanced task-specific performance. Yet, predefined metrics typically cannot
account for the inherent structure and varying importance of different features
in the data, and existing supervised approaches to ground metric learning often
do not generalize across multiple classes or are restricted to distributions
with shared supports. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach
for learning metrics for arbitrary distributions over a shared metric space.
Our method provides a distance between individual points like a global metric,
but requires only class labels on a distribution-level for training. The
learned global ground metric enables more accurate optimal transport distances,
leading to improved performance in embedding, clustering and classification
tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness and interpretability of our approach
using patient-level scRNA-seq data spanning multiple diseases.

Abstract: Exploration is critical for solving real-world decision-making problems such
as scientific discovery, where the objective is to generate truly novel designs
rather than mimic existing data distributions. In this work, we address the
challenge of leveraging the representational power of generative models for
exploration without relying on explicit uncertainty quantification. We
introduce a novel framework that casts exploration as entropy maximization over
the approximate data manifold implicitly defined by a pre-trained diffusion
model. Then, we present a novel principle for exploration based on density
estimation, a problem well-known to be challenging in practice. To overcome
this issue and render this method truly scalable, we leverage a fundamental
connection between the entropy of the density induced by a diffusion model and
its score function. Building on this, we develop an algorithm based on mirror
descent that solves the exploration problem as sequential fine-tuning of a
pre-trained diffusion model. We prove its convergence to the optimal
exploratory diffusion model under realistic assumptions by leveraging recent
understanding of mirror flows. Finally, we empirically evaluate our approach on
both synthetic and high-dimensional text-to-image diffusion, demonstrating
promising results.

Abstract: The Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model is a widely used model for
the spread of information and infectious diseases, particularly non-immunizing
ones, on a graph. Given a highly contagious disease, a natural question is how
to best vaccinate individuals to minimize the disease's extinction time. While
previous works showed that the problem of optimal vaccination is closely linked
to the NP-hard Spectral Radius Minimization (SRM) problem, they assumed that
the graph is known, which is often not the case in practice. In this work, we
consider the problem of minimizing the extinction time of an outbreak modeled
by an SIS model where the graph on which the disease spreads is unknown and
only the infection states of the vertices are observed. To this end, we split
the problem into two: learning the graph and determining effective vaccination
strategies. We propose a novel inclusion-exclusion-based learning algorithm
and, unlike previous approaches, establish its sample complexity for graph
recovery. We then detail an optimal algorithm for the SRM problem and prove
that its running time is polynomial in the number of vertices for graphs with
bounded treewidth. This is complemented by an efficient and effective
polynomial-time greedy heuristic for any graph. Finally, we present experiments
on synthetic and real-world data that numerically validate our learning and
vaccination algorithms.

Conclusion: VXAI框架填补了XAI评估的标准化空白，为研究者和实践者提供了系统化的工具。

Abstract: Modern AI systems frequently rely on opaque black-box models, most notably
Deep Neural Networks, whose performance stems from complex architectures with
millions of learned parameters. While powerful, their complexity poses a major
challenge to trustworthiness, particularly due to a lack of transparency.
Explainable AI (XAI) addresses this issue by providing human-understandable
explanations of model behavior. However, to ensure their usefulness and
trustworthiness, such explanations must be rigorously evaluated. Despite the
growing number of XAI methods, the field lacks standardized evaluation
protocols and consensus on appropriate metrics. To address this gap, we conduct
a systematic literature review following the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and introduce a
unified framework for the eValuation of XAI (VXAI). We identify 362 relevant
publications and aggregate their contributions into 41 functionally similar
metric groups. In addition, we propose a three-dimensional categorization
scheme spanning explanation type, evaluation contextuality, and explanation
quality desiderata. Our framework provides the most comprehensive and
structured overview of VXAI to date. It supports systematic metric selection,
promotes comparability across methods, and offers a flexible foundation for
future extensions.

Result: 综述填补了奖励建模系统研究的空白，涵盖了成熟和新兴方法。

Conclusion: 未来研究应关注奖励建模的进一步发展和应用。

Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL), agents continually interact with the
environment and use the feedback to refine their behavior. To guide policy
optimization, reward models are introduced as proxies of the desired
objectives, such that when the agent maximizes the accumulated reward, it also
fulfills the task designer's intentions. Recently, significant attention from
both academic and industrial researchers has focused on developing reward
models that not only align closely with the true objectives but also facilitate
policy optimization. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of
reward modeling techniques within the deep RL literature. We begin by outlining
the background and preliminaries in reward modeling. Next, we present an
overview of recent reward modeling approaches, categorizing them based on the
source, the mechanism, and the learning paradigm. Building on this
understanding, we discuss various applications of these reward modeling
techniques and review methods for evaluating reward models. Finally, we
conclude by highlighting promising research directions in reward modeling.
Altogether, this survey includes both established and emerging methods, filling
the vacancy of a systematic review of reward models in current literature.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that, under certain assumptions, zero-shot
reinforcement learning (RL) methods can generalise to any unseen task in an
environment after reward-free pre-training. Access to Markov states is one such
assumption, yet, in many real-world applications, the Markov state is only
partially observable. Here, we explore how the performance of standard
zero-shot RL methods degrades when subjected to partially observability, and
show that, as in single-task RL, memory-based architectures are an effective
remedy. We evaluate our memory-based zero-shot RL methods in domains where the
states, rewards and a change in dynamics are partially observed, and show
improved performance over memory-free baselines. Our code is open-sourced via:

TL;DR: 论文提出RHO方法，通过自适应学习同质性模式改进半监督图异常检测，解决了现有方法假设同质性单一的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有半监督图异常检测方法假设正常节点具有相似同质性，但现实中同质性可能多样，导致检测效果不佳。

Method: RHO包含两个模块：AdaFreq（自适应频率响应滤波器）和GNA（图正态性对齐），分别学习多频同质性模式并增强一致性。

Result: 在八个真实数据集上，RHO显著优于现有方法，能有效学习多样同质性。

Conclusion: RHO通过自适应学习同质性模式，提升了半监督图异常检测的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Semi-supervised graph anomaly detection (GAD) utilizes a small set of labeled
normal nodes to identify abnormal nodes from a large set of unlabeled nodes in
a graph. Current methods in this line posit that 1) normal nodes share a
similar level of homophily and 2) the labeled normal nodes can well represent
the homophily patterns in the normal class. However, this assumption often does
not hold well since normal nodes in a graph can exhibit diverse homophily in
real-world GAD datasets. In this paper, we propose RHO, namely Robust Homophily
Learning, to adaptively learn such homophily patterns. RHO consists of two
novel modules, adaptive frequency response filters (AdaFreq) and graph
normality alignment (GNA). AdaFreq learns a set of adaptive spectral filters
that capture different frequency components of the labeled normal nodes with
varying homophily in the channel-wise and cross-channel views of node
attributes. GNA is introduced to enforce consistency between the channel-wise
and cross-channel homophily representations to robustify the normality learned
by the filters in the two views. Experiments on eight real-world GAD datasets
show that RHO can effectively learn varying, often under-represented, homophily
in the small normal node set and substantially outperforms state-of-the-art
competing methods. Code is available at https://github.com/mala-lab/RHO.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统可视化方法仅关注点对点对齐，无法展示子序列层面的结构关系，难以理解时间序列之间的位移、加速或减速。

Method: 提出一种新技术，简化扭曲路径以突出、量化和可视化关键变换（位移、压缩、幅度差异）。

Result: 方法能够更清晰地表示子序列之间的匹配关系，提升时间序列比较的可解释性。

Conclusion: 该方法弥补了传统方法的不足，为时间序列比较提供了更直观和结构化的分析工具。

Abstract: Comparing time series is essential in various tasks such as clustering and
classification. While elastic distance measures that allow warping provide a
robust quantitative comparison, a qualitative comparison on top of them is
missing. Traditional visualizations focus on point-to-point alignment and do
not convey the broader structural relationships at the level of subsequences.
This limitation makes it difficult to understand how and where one time series
shifts, speeds up or slows down with respect to another. To address this, we
propose a novel technique that simplifies the warping path to highlight,
quantify and visualize key transformations (shift, compression, difference in
amplitude). By offering a clearer representation of how subsequences match
between time series, our method enhances interpretability in time series
comparison.

TL;DR: PRISM框架通过捕捉神经网络特征的复杂性，解决了现有特征描述方法在鲁棒性和单义性假设上的局限性，提升了特征描述的准确性和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有特征描述方法假设神经元仅编码单一概念（单义性），而实际上神经元常是多义的，这限制了特征描述的全面性和准确性。

Method: 提出了PRISM框架，为多义和单义特征提供更细致的描述，应用于语言模型并通过基准测试验证。

Result: PRISM在描述质量和捕捉多义性方面优于现有方法，提高了描述分数和多义性分数。

Conclusion: PRISM通过更复杂的特征描述，显著提升了神经网络特征的可解释性。

Abstract: Automated interpretability research aims to identify concepts encoded in
neural network features to enhance human understanding of model behavior.
Current feature description methods face two critical challenges: limited
robustness and the flawed assumption that each neuron encodes only a single
concept (monosemanticity), despite growing evidence that neurons are often
polysemantic. This assumption restricts the expressiveness of feature
descriptions and limits their ability to capture the full range of behaviors
encoded in model internals. To address this, we introduce Polysemantic FeatuRe
Identification and Scoring Method (PRISM), a novel framework that captures the
inherent complexity of neural network features. Unlike prior approaches that
assign a single description per feature, PRISM provides more nuanced
descriptions for both polysemantic and monosemantic features. We apply PRISM to
language models and, through extensive benchmarking against existing methods,
demonstrate that our approach produces more accurate and faithful feature
descriptions, improving both overall description quality (via a description
score) and the ability to capture distinct concepts when polysemanticity is
present (via a polysemanticity score).

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction (DR) techniques map high-dimensional data into
lower-dimensional spaces. Yet, current DR techniques are not designed to
explore semantic structure that is not directly available in the form of
variables or class labels. We introduce a novel user-guided projection
framework for image and text data that enables customizable, interpretable,
data visualizations via zero-shot classification with Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs). We enable users to steer projections dynamically via
natural-language guiding prompts, to specify high-level semantic relationships
of interest to the users which are not explicitly present in the data
dimensions. We evaluate our method across several datasets and show that it not
only enhances cluster separation, but also transforms DR into an interactive,
user-driven process. Our approach bridges the gap between fully automated DR
techniques and human-centered data exploration, offering a flexible and
adaptive way to tailor projections to specific analytical needs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管对齐模型已广泛使用，但其安全性仍可能被微调破坏，即使微调数据看似无害。

Method: 提出Low-Rank Extrapolation (LoX)方法，外推对齐LLM的安全子空间以增强鲁棒性。

Result: 实验显示LoX显著降低了攻击成功率（ASR），在良性或恶意微调攻击下减少11%至54%。

Conclusion: LoX通过将参数移至平坦区域，减少对扰动的敏感性，有效提升了LLM的安全性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become indispensable in real-world
applications. However, their widespread adoption raises significant safety
concerns, particularly in responding to socially harmful questions. Despite
substantial efforts to improve model safety through alignment, aligned models
can still have their safety protections undermined by subsequent fine-tuning -
even when the additional training data appears benign. In this paper, we
empirically demonstrate that this vulnerability stems from the sensitivity of
safety-critical low-rank subspaces in LLM parameters to fine-tuning. Building
on this insight, we propose a novel training-free method, termed Low-Rank
Extrapolation (LoX), to enhance safety robustness by extrapolating the safety
subspace of an aligned LLM. Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness
of LoX, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness against both
benign and malicious fine-tuning attacks while preserving the model's
adaptability to new tasks. For instance, LoX leads to 11% to 54% absolute
reductions in attack success rates (ASR) facing benign or malicious fine-tuning
attacks. By investigating the ASR landscape of parameters, we attribute the
success of LoX to that the extrapolation moves LLM parameters to a flatter
zone, thereby less sensitive to perturbations. The code is available at
github.com/VITA-Group/LoX.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为LIT-LVM的方法，通过低维潜在向量表示特征，以更准确地估计线性预测器中交互项的系数，并在高维数据中减少过拟合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 线性预测器在处理非线性关系时通常需要引入交互项，但高维数据中交互项的系数估计容易过拟合，因此需要一种更有效的结构化正则化方法。

Method: LIT-LVM方法假设交互项系数具有低维结构，通过将特征表示为低维潜在向量来实现结构化正则化。

Result: 实验表明，LIT-LVM在模拟和真实数据上的预测准确性优于弹性网和因子分解机，尤其在交互项数量远多于样本数时表现更优。

Conclusion: LIT-LVM不仅提高了预测准确性，还提供了低维潜在表示，有助于可视化和分析特征间的关系。

Abstract: Some of the simplest, yet most frequently used predictors in statistics and
machine learning use weighted linear combinations of features. Such linear
predictors can model non-linear relationships between features by adding
interaction terms corresponding to the products of all pairs of features. We
consider the problem of accurately estimating coefficients for interaction
terms in linear predictors. We hypothesize that the coefficients for different
interaction terms have an approximate low-dimensional structure and represent
each feature by a latent vector in a low-dimensional space. This
low-dimensional representation can be viewed as a structured regularization
approach that further mitigates overfitting in high-dimensional settings beyond
standard regularizers such as the lasso and elastic net. We demonstrate that
our approach, called LIT-LVM, achieves superior prediction accuracy compared to
elastic net and factorization machines on a wide variety of simulated and real
data, particularly when the number of interaction terms is high compared to the
number of samples. LIT-LVM also provides low-dimensional latent representations
for features that are useful for visualizing and analyzing their relationships.

TL;DR: AutoRule是一种自动从人类偏好反馈中提取规则并转化为基于规则的奖励的方法，显著提升了强化学习性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于规则的奖励方法依赖人工规则设计，AutoRule旨在实现完全自动化，减少人工干预。

Method: AutoRule分三阶段：利用推理模型解释用户偏好，从推理链中提取候选规则，合成统一规则集，并用语言模型验证规则满足度作为辅助奖励。

Result: 在Llama-3-8B模型上，AutoRule使AlpacaEval2.0的胜率提升28.6%，MT-Bench子集第二轮性能提升6.1%。

Conclusion: AutoRule提取的规则与数据集偏好一致，减少了奖励滥用，并捕捉了不同数据集的独特价值。

Abstract: Rule-based rewards offer a promising strategy for improving reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF), but current approaches often rely on
manual rule engineering. We present AutoRule, a fully automated method for
extracting rules from preference feedback and formulating them into rule-based
rewards. AutoRule extraction operates in three stages: it leverages a reasoning
model to interpret user preferences, identifies candidate rules from the
reasoning chain of these interpretations, and synthesizes them into a unified
rule set. Leveraging the finalized rule set, we employ language-model verifiers
to compute the fraction of rules satisfied by each output, using this metric as
an auxiliary reward alongside the learned reward model during policy
optimization. Training a Llama-3-8B model with AutoRule results in a 28.6\%
relative improvement in length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval2.0, and a
6.1\% relative gain in second-turn performance on a held-out MT-Bench subset,
compared to a GRPO baseline trained with the same learned reward model but
without the rule-based auxiliary reward. Our analysis confirms that the
extracted rules exhibit good agreement with dataset preference. We find that
AutoRule demonstrates reduced reward hacking compared to a learned reward model
when run over two episodes. Finally, our case study suggests that the extracted
rules capture unique qualities valued in different datasets. The extracted
rules are provided in the appendix, and the code is open-sourced at

Conclusion: 该框架为归因方法提供了可靠的鲁棒性保证，使其能够在下游任务中更可信地使用。

Abstract: Post-hoc attribution methods aim to explain deep learning predictions by
highlighting influential input pixels. However, these explanations are highly
non-robust: small, imperceptible input perturbations can drastically alter the
attribution map while maintaining the same prediction. This vulnerability
undermines their trustworthiness and calls for rigorous robustness guarantees
of pixel-level attribution scores. We introduce the first certification
framework that guarantees pixel-level robustness for any black-box attribution
method using randomized smoothing. By sparsifying and smoothing attribution
maps, we reformulate the task as a segmentation problem and certify each
pixel's importance against $\ell_2$-bounded perturbations. We further propose
three evaluation metrics to assess certified robustness, localization, and
faithfulness. An extensive evaluation of 12 attribution methods across 5
ImageNet models shows that our certified attributions are robust,
interpretable, and faithful, enabling reliable use in downstream tasks. Our
code is at https://github.com/AlaaAnani/certified-attributions.

Conclusion: 密集潜在特征是语言模型计算中的功能性组成部分，不应被视为噪声。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are designed to extract interpretable features
from language models by enforcing a sparsity constraint. Ideally, training an
SAE would yield latents that are both sparse and semantically meaningful.
However, many SAE latents activate frequently (i.e., are \emph{dense}), raising
concerns that they may be undesirable artifacts of the training procedure. In
this work, we systematically investigate the geometry, function, and origin of
dense latents and show that they are not only persistent but often reflect
meaningful model representations. We first demonstrate that dense latents tend
to form antipodal pairs that reconstruct specific directions in the residual
stream, and that ablating their subspace suppresses the emergence of new dense
features in retrained SAEs -- suggesting that high density features are an
intrinsic property of the residual space. We then introduce a taxonomy of dense
latents, identifying classes tied to position tracking, context binding,
entropy regulation, letter-specific output signals, part-of-speech, and
principal component reconstruction. Finally, we analyze how these features
evolve across layers, revealing a shift from structural features in early
layers, to semantic features in mid layers, and finally to output-oriented
signals in the last layers of the model. Our findings indicate that dense
latents serve functional roles in language model computation and should not be
dismissed as training noise.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管图神经网络（GNNs）在多个领域取得了成功，但其在时空场景下的信息传播能力（如过压缩问题）尚未被充分研究，尤其是时空维度加剧了这一挑战。

Method: 论文形式化了时空过压缩问题，分析了卷积STGNNs的信息传播特性，并比较了不同处理范式（时间-空间并行或顺序）的影响。

Result: 研究发现，卷积STGNNs倾向于传播时间上较远而非较近的信息，且不同处理范式均受此现象影响，为高效实现提供了理论依据。

Conclusion: 通过合成和真实数据验证，论文为STGNNs的设计提供了更深入的动态理解和原则性指导。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success across various
domains. However, recent theoretical advances have identified fundamental
limitations in their information propagation capabilities, such as
over-squashing, where distant nodes fail to effectively exchange information.
While extensively studied in static contexts, this issue remains unexplored in
Spatiotemporal GNNs (STGNNs), which process sequences associated with graph
nodes. Nonetheless, the temporal dimension amplifies this challenge by
increasing the information that must be propagated. In this work, we formalize
the spatiotemporal over-squashing problem and demonstrate its distinct
characteristics compared to the static case. Our analysis reveals that
counterintuitively, convolutional STGNNs favor information propagation from
points temporally distant rather than close in time. Moreover, we prove that
architectures that follow either time-and-space or time-then-space processing
paradigms are equally affected by this phenomenon, providing theoretical
justification for computationally efficient implementations. We validate our
findings on synthetic and real-world datasets, providing deeper insights into

*Le Vu Anh,Nguyen Viet Anh,Mehmet Dik,Luong Van Nghia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RePCS是一种无需模型访问或重新训练的轻量级方法，通过比较两种推理路径的KL散度来检测RAG系统中检索证据的使用情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RAG模型中可能依赖记忆而非检索信息的问题，确保输出基于最新外部信息。

Method: 通过比较仅使用查询的推理路径和使用查询加检索上下文的推理路径的KL散度，判断检索的影响。

Result: 在Prompt-WNQA基准测试中，RePCS的ROC-AUC达到0.918，优于现有方法6.5个百分点，延迟增加低于4.7%。

Conclusion: RePCS为RAG系统提供了一种轻量级、黑盒的安全保障，特别适用于安全关键应用。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a common strategy for
updating large language model (LLM) responses with current, external
information. However, models may still rely on memorized training data, bypass
the retrieved evidence, and produce contaminated outputs. We introduce
Retrieval-Path Contamination Scoring (RePCS), a diagnostic method that detects
such behavior without requiring model access or retraining. RePCS compares two
inference paths: (i) a parametric path using only the query, and (ii) a
retrieval-augmented path using both the query and retrieved context by
computing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between their output
distributions. A low divergence suggests that the retrieved context had minimal
impact, indicating potential memorization. This procedure is model-agnostic,
requires no gradient or internal state access, and adds only a single
additional forward pass. We further derive PAC-style guarantees that link the
KL threshold to user-defined false positive and false negative rates. On the
Prompt-WNQA benchmark, RePCS achieves a ROC-AUC of 0.918. This result
outperforms the strongest prior method by 6.5 percentage points while keeping
latency overhead below 4.7% on an NVIDIA T4 GPU. RePCS offers a lightweight,
black-box safeguard to verify whether a RAG system meaningfully leverages
retrieval, making it especially valuable in safety-critical applications.

Result: 恢复了与先前研究相同的偏差和方差界限，但方法更简单。

Conclusion: 简化后的分析使SGD在线性回归中的理论更易理解，有助于进一步研究小批量化和学习率调度。

Abstract: Theoretically understanding stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in
overparameterized models has led to the development of several optimization
algorithms that are widely used in practice today. Recent work
by~\citet{zou2021benign} provides sharp rates for SGD optimization in linear
regression using constant learning rate, both with and without tail iterate
averaging, based on a bias-variance decomposition of the risk. In our work, we
provide a simplified analysis recovering the same bias and variance bounds
provided in~\citep{zou2021benign} based on simple linear algebra tools,
bypassing the requirement to manipulate operators on positive semi-definite
(PSD) matrices. We believe our work makes the analysis of SGD on linear
regression very accessible and will be helpful in further analyzing
mini-batching and learning rate scheduling, leading to improvements in the
training of realistic models.

Motivation: 传统输入输出观察不足以学习一般递归函数，需引入更现实的约束条件。

Method: 提出时间限制观察和策略轨迹观察，结合计算复杂性约束或近似时间限制观察。

Result: 通过策略轨迹观察学习可计算函数可简化为输入输出学习有理函数，但线性时间可计算函数不存在可计算或多项式质量特征集。

Conclusion: 扩展的观察方法能突破学习障碍，但某些函数类仍存在学习限制。

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of learning computable functions in the limit
by extending Gold's inductive inference framework to incorporate
\textit{computational observations} and \textit{restricted input sources}.
Complimentary to the traditional Input-Output Observations, we introduce
Time-Bound Observations, and Policy-Trajectory Observations to study the
learnability of general recursive functions under more realistic constraints.
While input-output observations do not suffice for learning the class of
general recursive functions in the limit, we overcome this learning barrier by
imposing computational complexity constraints or supplementing with approximate
time-bound observations. Further, we build a formal framework around
observations of \textit{computational agents} and show that learning computable
functions from policy trajectories reduces to learning rational functions from
input and output, thereby revealing interesting connections to finite-state
transducer inference. On the negative side, we show that computable or
polynomial-mass characteristic sets cannot exist for the class of linear-time
computable functions even for policy-trajectory observations.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了梯度病理与非平稳性是扩展挑战的核心，提出的干预措施有效解决了问题。

Abstract: Scaling deep reinforcement learning networks is challenging and often results
in degraded performance, yet the root causes of this failure mode remain poorly
understood. Several recent works have proposed mechanisms to address this, but
they are often complex and fail to highlight the causes underlying this
difficulty. In this work, we conduct a series of empirical analyses which
suggest that the combination of non-stationarity with gradient pathologies, due
to suboptimal architectural choices, underlie the challenges of scale. We
propose a series of direct interventions that stabilize gradient flow, enabling
robust performance across a range of network depths and widths. Our
interventions are simple to implement and compatible with well-established
algorithms, and result in an effective mechanism that enables strong
performance even at large scales. We validate our findings on a variety of
agents and suites of environments.

Conclusion: DAILOC有效解决了域偏移和灾难性遗忘问题，显著提升了室内定位的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Wi-Fi fingerprinting-based indoor localization faces significant challenges
in real-world deployments due to domain shifts arising from device
heterogeneity and temporal variations within indoor environments. Existing
approaches often address these issues independently, resulting in poor
generalization and susceptibility to catastrophic forgetting over time. In this
work, we propose DAILOC, a novel domain-incremental learning framework that
jointly addresses both temporal and device-induced domain shifts. DAILOC
introduces a novel disentanglement strategy that separates domain shifts from
location-relevant features using a multi-level variational autoencoder.
Additionally, we introduce a novel memory-guided class latent alignment
mechanism to address the effects of catastrophic forgetting over time.
Experiments across multiple smartphones, buildings, and time instances
demonstrate that DAILOC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
achieving up to 2.74x lower average error and 4.6x lower worst-case error.

Conclusion: LogNet不仅提升了深度学习模型的可解释性，还显著提高了性能和长期稳定性。

Abstract: Indoor localization using deep learning (DL) has demonstrated strong accuracy
in mapping Wi-Fi RSS fingerprints to physical locations; however, most existing
DL frameworks function as black-box models, offering limited insight into how
predictions are made or how models respond to real-world noise over time. This
lack of interpretability hampers our ability to understand the impact of
temporal variations - caused by environmental dynamics - and to adapt models
for long-term reliability. To address this, we introduce LogNet, a novel logic
gate-based framework designed to interpret and enhance DL-based indoor
localization. LogNet enables transparent reasoning by identifying which access
points (APs) are most influential for each reference point (RP) and reveals how
environmental noise disrupts DL-driven localization decisions. This
interpretability allows us to trace and diagnose model failures and adapt DL
systems for more stable long-term deployments. Evaluations across multiple
real-world building floorplans and over two years of temporal variation show
that LogNet not only interprets the internal behavior of DL models but also
improves performance-achieving up to 1.1x to 2.8x lower localization error,
3.4x to 43.3x smaller model size, and 1.5x to 3.6x lower latency compared to
prior DL-based models.

ensembling zero-shot a set of expert models, assessing our methodology using a

TL;DR: MicroRicci是一种自适应的局部Ricci流求解器，通过结合编码理论和轻量级神经网络模块，显著提升了网格平滑的效率和效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统Ricci流求解器全局更新成本高和启发式方法收敛慢或调参困难的问题。

Method: 采用贪婪的综合征解码步骤（O(E)时间）和两个轻量级神经网络模块，动态选择顶点和步长。

Result: 在110个SJTU-TMQA网格上，迭代次数减少2.4倍，曲率分布更紧，UV失真与MOS相关性达-0.93，运行时间加速1.8倍。

Conclusion: MicroRicci适用于实时、资源受限的图形和仿真应用，因其线性时间更新、自动调参和高几何/感知质量。

Abstract: Real-time mesh smoothing at scale remains a formidable challenge: classical
Ricci-flow solvers demand costly global updates, while greedy heuristics suffer
from slow convergence or brittle tuning. We present MicroRicci, the first truly
self-tuning, local Ricci-flow solver that borrows ideas from coding theory and
packs them into just 1K + 200 parameters. Its primary core is a greedy
syndrome-decoding step that pinpoints and corrects the largest curvature error
in O(E) time, augmented by two tiny neural modules that adaptively choose
vertices and step sizes on the fly. On a diverse set of 110 SJTU-TMQA meshes,
MicroRicci slashes iteration counts from 950+=140 to 400+=80 (2.4x speedup),
tightens curvature spread from 0.19 to 0.185, and achieves a remarkable
UV-distortion-to-MOS correlation of r = -0.93. It adds only 0.25 ms per
iteration (0.80 to 1.05 ms), yielding an end-to-end 1.8x runtime acceleration
over state-of-the-art methods. MicroRicci's combination of linear-time updates,
automatic hyperparameter adaptation, and high-quality geometric and perceptual
results makes it well suited for real-time, resource-limited applications in
graphics, simulation, and related fields.

TL;DR: DP-GRAPE是一种新的差分隐私训练方法，通过梯度随机投影显著减少内存使用，同时保持与现有方法相当的效用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准差分隐私方法（如DP-Adam）因逐样本梯度裁剪导致高内存开销，限制了可扩展性。

Method: DP-GRAPE引入三个关键改进：梯度在投影后私有化、使用随机高斯矩阵替代SVD子空间、在反向传播时应用投影。

Result: 实验表明，DP-GRAPE在预训练Vision Transformers和微调RoBERTa-Large时分别减少63%和70%内存使用，且性能相当。

Conclusion: DP-GRAPE在保持隐私-效用平衡的同时，显著降低了内存需求，适用于大规模模型训练。

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) protects sensitive data during neural network
training, but standard methods like DP-Adam suffer from high memory overhead
due to per-sample gradient clipping, limiting scalability. We introduce
DP-GRAPE (Gradient RAndom ProjEction), a DP training method that significantly
reduces memory usage while maintaining utility on par with first-order DP
approaches. Rather than directly applying DP to GaLore, DP-GRAPE introduces
three key modifications: (1) gradients are privatized after projection, (2)
random Gaussian matrices replace SVD-based subspaces, and (3) projection is
applied during backpropagation. These contributions eliminate the need for
costly SVD computations, enable substantial memory savings, and lead to
improved utility. Despite operating in lower-dimensional subspaces, our
theoretical analysis shows that DP-GRAPE achieves a privacy-utility trade-off
comparable to DP-SGD. Our extensive empirical experiments show that DP-GRAPE
can reduce the memory footprint of DP training without sacrificing accuracy or
training time. In particular, DP-GRAPE reduces memory usage by over 63% when
pre-training Vision Transformers and over 70% when fine-tuning RoBERTa-Large as
compared to DP-Adam, while achieving similar performance. We further
demonstrate that DP-GRAPE scales to fine-tuning large models such as OPT with
up to 6.7 billion parameters.

Result: 实验表明，GFLC在性能和公平性指标之间取得了显著改进。

Conclusion: GFLC是一种有效的方法，能够同时解决标签噪声和公平性问题。

Abstract: Fairness in machine learning (ML) has a critical importance for building
trustworthy machine learning system as artificial intelligence (AI) systems
increasingly impact various aspects of society, including healthcare decisions
and legal judgments. Moreover, numerous studies demonstrate evidence of unfair
outcomes in ML and the need for more robust fairness-aware methods. However,
the data we use to train and develop debiasing techniques often contains biased
and noisy labels. As a result, the label bias in the training data affects
model performance and misrepresents the fairness of classifiers during testing.
To tackle this problem, our paper presents Graph-based Fairness-aware Label
Correction (GFLC), an efficient method for correcting label noise while
preserving demographic parity in datasets. In particular, our approach combines
three key components: prediction confidence measure, graph-based regularization
through Ricci-flow-optimized graph Laplacians, and explicit demographic parity
incentives. Our experimental findings show the effectiveness of our proposed
approach and show significant improvements in the trade-off between performance
and fairness metrics compared to the baseline.

Abstract: $\textbf{Objective:}$ Brain-predicted age difference (BrainAGE) is a
neuroimaging biomarker reflecting brain health. However, training robust
BrainAGE models requires large datasets, often restricted by privacy concerns.
This study evaluates the performance of federated learning (FL) for BrainAGE
estimation in ischemic stroke patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy,
and investigates its association with clinical phenotypes and functional
outcomes.
  $\textbf{Methods:}$ We used FLAIR brain images from 1674 stroke patients
across 16 hospital centers. We implemented standard machine learning and deep
learning models for BrainAGE estimates under three data management strategies:
centralized learning (pooled data), FL (local training at each site), and
single-site learning. We reported prediction errors and examined associations
between BrainAGE and vascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes mellitus,
hypertension, smoking), as well as functional outcomes at three months
post-stroke. Logistic regression evaluated BrainAGE's predictive value for
these outcomes, adjusting for age, sex, vascular risk factors, stroke severity,
time between MRI and arterial puncture, prior intravenous thrombolysis, and
recanalisation outcome.
  $\textbf{Results:}$ While centralized learning yielded the most accurate
predictions, FL consistently outperformed single-site models. BrainAGE was
significantly higher in patients with diabetes mellitus across all models.
Comparisons between patients with good and poor functional outcomes, and
multivariate predictions of these outcomes showed the significance of the
association between BrainAGE and post-stroke recovery.
  $\textbf{Conclusion:}$ FL enables accurate age predictions without data
centralization. The strong association between BrainAGE, vascular risk factors,
and post-stroke recovery highlights its potential for prognostic modeling in
stroke care.

Conclusion: CAWR有效解决了AWR的保守性问题，提升了离线强化学习的性能。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (offline RL) algorithms often require
additional constraints or penalty terms to address distribution shift issues,
such as adding implicit or explicit policy constraints during policy
optimization to reduce the estimation bias of functions. This paper focuses on
a limitation of the Advantage-Weighted Regression family (AWRs), i.e., the
potential for learning over-conservative policies due to data corruption,
specifically the poor explorations in suboptimal offline data. We study it from
two perspectives: (1) how poor explorations impact the theoretically optimal
policy based on KL divergence, and (2) how such poor explorations affect the
approximation of the theoretically optimal policy. We prove that such
over-conservatism is mainly caused by the sensitivity of the loss function for
policy optimization to poor explorations, and the proportion of poor
explorations in offline datasets. To address this concern, we propose
Corruption-Averse Advantage-Weighted Regression (CAWR), which incorporates a
set of robust loss functions during policy optimization and an advantage-based
prioritized experience replay method to filter out poor explorations. Numerical
experiments on the D4RL benchmark show that our method can learn superior
policies from suboptimal offline data, significantly enhancing the performance
of policy optimization.

Motivation: 360度视频在VR中广泛应用，但分辨率不足限制了视觉质量。传统VSR技术无法解决360度视频的失真问题，且缺乏相关数据集。

Method: 提出S3PO模型，采用循环建模和注意力机制，设计了针对球形失真的特征提取器和损失函数。

Result: S3PO在360度视频数据集上优于现有VSR和360度专用超分辨率模型。

Conclusion: S3PO为360度视频超分辨率提供了有效解决方案，并通过消融研究验证了其设计组件的有效性。

Abstract: Omnidirectional Videos (or 360{\deg} videos) are widely used in Virtual
Reality (VR) to facilitate immersive and interactive viewing experiences.
However, the limited spatial resolution in 360{\deg} videos does not allow for
each degree of view to be represented with adequate pixels, limiting the visual
quality offered in the immersive experience. Deep learning Video
Super-Resolution (VSR) techniques used for conventional videos could provide a
promising software-based solution; however, these techniques do not tackle the
distortion present in equirectangular projections of 360{\deg} video signals.
An additional obstacle is the limited availability of 360{\deg} video datasets
for study. To address these issues, this paper creates a novel 360{\deg} Video
Dataset (360VDS) with a study of the extensibility of conventional VSR models
to 360{\deg} videos. This paper further proposes a novel deep learning model
for 360{\deg} Video Super-Resolution (360{\deg} VSR), called Spherical Signal
Super-resolution with a Proportioned Optimisation (S3PO). S3PO adopts recurrent
modelling with an attention mechanism, unbound from conventional VSR techniques
like alignment. With a purpose-built feature extractor and a novel loss
function addressing spherical distortion, S3PO outperforms most
state-of-the-art conventional VSR models and 360{\deg}~specific
super-resolution models on 360{\deg} video datasets. A step-wise ablation study
is presented to understand and demonstrate the impact of the chosen
architectural sub-components, targeted training and optimisation.

Abstract: Model Predictive Path Integral control is a powerful sampling-based approach
suitable for complex robotic tasks due to its flexibility in handling nonlinear
dynamics and non-convex costs. However, its applicability in real-time,
highfrequency robotic control scenarios is limited by computational demands.
This paper introduces Feedback-MPPI (F-MPPI), a novel framework that augments
standard MPPI by computing local linear feedback gains derived from sensitivity
analysis inspired by Riccati-based feedback used in gradient-based MPC. These
gains allow for rapid closed-loop corrections around the current state without
requiring full re-optimization at each timestep. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of F-MPPI through simulations and real-world experiments on two
robotic platforms: a quadrupedal robot performing dynamic locomotion on uneven
terrain and a quadrotor executing aggressive maneuvers with onboard
computation. Results illustrate that incorporating local feedback significantly
improves control performance and stability, enabling robust, high-frequency
operation suitable for complex robotic systems.

desired behaviors. While current robot programming tools (such as inverse
kinematics, collision avoidance, and manipulation planning) often treat these
problems as constrained optimization, many existing solvers focus on specific
problem domains or do not exploit geometric constraints effectively. We propose
an efficient first-order method, Augmented Lagrangian Spectral Projected
Gradient Descent (ALSPG), which leverages geometric projections via Euclidean
projections, Minkowski sums, and basis functions. We show that by using
geometric constraints rather than full constraints and gradients, ALSPG
significantly improves real-time performance. Compared to second-order methods
like iLQR, ALSPG remains competitive in the unconstrained case. We validate our
method through toy examples and extensive simulations, and demonstrate its
effectiveness on a 7-axis Franka robot, a 6-axis P-Rob robot and a 1:10 scale
car in real-world experiments. Source codes, experimental data and videos are

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决家庭用餐辅助中因活动多样性、情境复杂性和用户偏好差异带来的挑战。

Method: 采用模块化硬件、多样化交互方法和参数化行为树，结合大型语言模型实现安全透明的个性化适配。

Result: FEAST在透明性和安全性上优于固定定制基线，并通过家庭用户研究验证了其实际适用性。

Conclusion: FEAST能够成功满足不同用户的个性化需求，展示了其在现实环境中的潜力。

Abstract: Physical caregiving robots hold promise for improving the quality of life of
millions worldwide who require assistance with feeding. However, in-home meal
assistance remains challenging due to the diversity of activities (e.g.,
eating, drinking, mouth wiping), contexts (e.g., socializing, watching TV),
food items, and user preferences that arise during deployment. In this work, we
propose FEAST, a flexible mealtime-assistance system that can be personalized
in-the-wild to meet the unique needs of individual care recipients. Developed
in collaboration with two community researchers and informed by a formative
study with a diverse group of care recipients, our system is guided by three
key tenets for in-the-wild personalization: adaptability, transparency, and
safety. FEAST embodies these principles through: (i) modular hardware that
enables switching between assisted feeding, drinking, and mouth-wiping, (ii)
diverse interaction methods, including a web interface, head gestures, and
physical buttons, to accommodate diverse functional abilities and preferences,
and (iii) parameterized behavior trees that can be safely and transparently
adapted using a large language model. We evaluate our system based on the
personalization requirements identified in our formative study, demonstrating
that FEAST offers a wide range of transparent and safe adaptations and
outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline limited to fixed customizations. To
demonstrate real-world applicability, we conduct an in-home user study with two
care recipients (who are community researchers), feeding them three meals each
across three diverse scenarios. We further assess FEAST's ecological validity
by evaluating with an Occupational Therapist previously unfamiliar with the
system. In all cases, users successfully personalize FEAST to meet their
individual needs and preferences. Website: https://emprise.cs.cornell.edu/feast

Conclusion: 提出的系统为四旋翼无人机在未知环境中实现安全、高效的自主导航提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Quadrotors hold significant promise for several applications such as
agriculture, search and rescue, and infrastructure inspection. Achieving
autonomous operation requires systems to navigate safely through complex and
unfamiliar environments. This level of autonomy is particularly challenging due
to the complexity of such environments and the need for real-time decision
making especially for platforms constrained by size, weight, and power (SWaP),
which limits flight time and precludes the use of bulky sensors like Light
Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) for mapping. Furthermore, computing globally
optimal, collision-free paths and translating them into time-optimized, safe
trajectories in real time adds significant computational complexity. To address
these challenges, we present a fully onboard, real-time navigation system that
relies solely on lightweight onboard sensors. Our system constructs a dense 3D
map of the environment using a novel visual depth estimation approach that
fuses stereo and monocular learning-based depth, yielding longer-range, denser,
and less noisy depth maps than conventional stereo methods. Building on this
map, we introduce a novel planning and trajectory generation framework capable
of rapidly computing time-optimal global trajectories. As the map is
incrementally updated with new depth information, our system continuously
refines the trajectory to maintain safety and optimality. Both our planner and
trajectory generator outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of
computational efficiency and guarantee obstacle-free trajectories. We validate
our system through robust autonomous flight experiments in diverse indoor and
outdoor environments, demonstrating its effectiveness for safe navigation in
previously unknown settings.

Abstract: Omnidirectional aerial robots offer full 6-DoF independent control over
position and orientation, making them popular for aerial manipulation. Although
advancements in robotic autonomy, operating by human remains essential in
complex aerial environments. Existing teleoperation approaches for multirotors
fail to fully leverage the additional DoFs provided by omnidirectional
rotation. Additionally, the dexterity of human fingers should be exploited for
more engaged interaction. In this work, we propose an aerial teleoperation
system that brings the omnidirectionality of human hands into the unbounded
aerial workspace. Our system includes two motion-tracking marker sets -- one on
the shoulder and one on the hand -- along with a data glove to capture hand
gestures. Using these inputs, we design four interaction modes for different
tasks, including Spherical Mode and Cartesian Mode for long-range moving as
well as Operation Mode and Locking Mode for precise manipulation, where the
hand gestures are utilized for seamless mode switching. We evaluate our system
on a valve-turning task in real world, demonstrating how each mode contributes
to effective aerial manipulation. This interaction framework bridges human
dexterity with aerial robotics, paving the way for enhanced teleoperated aerial
manipulation in unstructured environments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种显式建模方法，将上下文不变偏好与上下文相关特征重要性分开，以提高奖励学习的样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将每个新上下文视为独立任务，导致数据需求大且效率低。本文观察到上下文影响的是特征重要性而非偏好本身，因此提出显式建模以提高效率。

Method: 引入校准特征和专用配对比较查询，显式分离偏好与特征重要性，形成模块化奖励表示。

Result: 模拟实验显示方法显著提升样本效率，比基线少10倍查询量，低数据场景性能提升15%。用户研究验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 显式建模偏好与特征重要性可提高奖励学习的适应性和个性化，减少数据需求。

Abstract: A key challenge in reward learning from human input is that desired agent
behavior often changes based on context. Traditional methods typically treat
each new context as a separate task with its own reward function. For example,
if a previously ignored stove becomes too hot to be around, the robot must
learn a new reward from scratch, even though the underlying preference for
prioritizing safety over efficiency remains unchanged. We observe that context
influences not the underlying preference itself, but rather the
$\textit{saliency}$--or importance--of reward features. For instance, stove
heat affects the importance of the robot's proximity, yet the human's safety
preference stays the same. Existing multi-task and meta IRL methods learn
context-dependent representations $\textit{implicitly}$--without distinguishing
between preferences and feature importance--resulting in substantial data
requirements. Instead, we propose $\textit{explicitly}$ modeling
context-invariant preferences separately from context-dependent feature
saliency, creating modular reward representations that adapt to new contexts.
To achieve this, we introduce $\textit{calibrated features}$--representations
that capture contextual effects on feature saliency--and present specialized
paired comparison queries that isolate saliency from preference for efficient
learning. Experiments with simulated users show our method significantly
improves sample efficiency, requiring 10x fewer preference queries than
baselines to achieve equivalent reward accuracy, with up to 15% better
performance in low-data regimes (5-10 queries). An in-person user study (N=12)
demonstrates that participants can effectively teach their unique personal
contextual preferences using our method, enabling more adaptable and
personalized reward learning.

Motivation: 现有任务分配方法假设机器人是单任务的，这在某些情况下效率低下或不可行，因此需要支持多任务机器人的新方法。

Method: 提出了一种任务分配框架，考虑了多任务引入的物理约束，并通过加权MAX-SAT编译和贪婪启发式方法求解。

Result: 在合成领域和模拟场景中验证了多任务的优势，并通过物理实验展示了实际效率提升。

Conclusion: 多任务机器人任务分配框架能显著提高效率，适用于复杂任务交互和实际场景。

Abstract: One simplifying assumption in existing and well-performing task allocation
methods is that the robots are single-tasking: each robot operates on a single
task at any given time. While this assumption is harmless to make in some
situations, it can be inefficient or even infeasible in others. In this paper,
we consider assigning multi-robot tasks to multitasking robots. The key
contribution is a novel task allocation framework that incorporates the
consideration of physical constraints introduced by multitasking. This is in
contrast to the existing work where such constraints are largely ignored. After
formulating the problem, we propose a compilation to weighted MAX-SAT, which
allows us to leverage existing solvers for a solution. A more efficient greedy
heuristic is then introduced. For evaluation, we first compare our methods with
a modern baseline that is efficient for single-tasking robots to validate the
benefits of multitasking in synthetic domains. Then, using a site-clearing
scenario in simulation, we further illustrate the complex task interaction
considered by the multitasking robots in our approach to demonstrate its
performance. Finally, we demonstrate a physical experiment to show how
multitasking enabled by our approach can benefit task efficiency in a realistic
setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交机器人通常使用单调的“快乐”语音，缺乏人类语音的长期变化，难以维持听众的参与度。

Method: 采用轻量级Matcha-TTS框架，结合表情符号提示技术，实现实时语音生成和表达力控制。

Result: 在讲故事任务中，多样化的表情符号提示显著提升了语音表达力和感知效果，但在助手场景中效果不佳。

Conclusion: EmojiVoice为社交机器人提供了灵活的表达力控制工具，但需根据应用场景调整使用策略。

Abstract: Humans vary their expressivity when speaking for extended periods to maintain
engagement with their listener. Although social robots tend to be deployed with
``expressive'' joyful voices, they lack this long-term variation found in human
speech. Foundation model text-to-speech systems are beginning to mimic the
expressivity in human speech, but they are difficult to deploy offline on
robots. We present EmojiVoice, a free, customizable text-to-speech (TTS)
toolkit that allows social roboticists to build temporally variable, expressive
speech on social robots. We introduce emoji-prompting to allow fine-grained
control of expressivity on a phase level and use the lightweight Matcha-TTS
backbone to generate speech in real-time. We explore three case studies: (1) a
scripted conversation with a robot assistant, (2) a storytelling robot, and (3)
an autonomous speech-to-speech interactive agent. We found that using varied
emoji prompting improved the perception and expressivity of speech over a long
period in a storytelling task, but expressive voice was not preferred in the
assistant use case.

Motivation: 现有语言教学机器人缺乏任务特定的合成语音，可能影响教学效果，因此需要开发更合适的语音系统。

Method: 1. 使用微调的Matcha-TTS和表情符号提示创建表达性语音；2. 调整语音以适应物理和社交环境；3. 开发针对L2学习者的清晰语音模式，优化元音时长。

Result: 表达性语音更生动且适合长时间使用；环境适应性语音更贴合场景；L2清晰模式提高了可懂度和尊重感，减少了转录错误。

Conclusion: 提出的语音改进显著提升了语言教学机器人的效果，特别是在表达性、环境适应性和L2学习者支持方面。

Abstract: While the use of social robots for language teaching has been explored, there
remains limited work on a task-specific synthesized voices for language
teaching robots. Given that language is a verbal task, this gap may have severe
consequences for the effectiveness of robots for language teaching tasks. We
address this lack of L2 teaching robot voices through three contributions: 1.
We address the need for a lightweight and expressive robot voice. Using a
fine-tuned version of Matcha-TTS, we use emoji prompting to create an
expressive voice that shows a range of expressivity over time. The voice can
run in real time with limited compute resources. Through case studies, we found
this voice more expressive, socially appropriate, and suitable for long periods
of expressive speech, such as storytelling. 2. We explore how to adapt a
robot's voice to physical and social ambient environments to deploy our voices
in various locations. We found that increasing pitch and pitch rate in noisy
and high-energy environments makes the robot's voice appear more appropriate
and makes it seem more aware of its current environment. 3. We create an
English TTS system with improved clarity for L2 listeners using known
linguistic properties of vowels that are difficult for these listeners. We used
a data-driven, perception-based approach to understand how L2 speakers use
duration cues to interpret challenging words with minimal tense (long) and lax
(short) vowels in English. We found that the duration of vowels strongly
influences the perception for L2 listeners and created an "L2 clarity mode" for
Matcha-TTS that applies a lengthening to tense vowels while leaving lax vowels
unchanged. Our clarity mode was found to be more respectful, intelligible, and
encouraging than base Matcha-TTS while reducing transcription errors in these
challenging tense/lax minimal pairs.

Conclusion: 该研究为仿人指尖的触觉传感器设计提供了有效解决方案，显著提升了曲面触觉感知的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: To achieve human-like haptic perception in anthropomorphic grippers, the
compliant sensing surfaces of vision tactile sensor (VTS) must evolve from
conventional planar configurations to biomimetically curved topographies with
continuous surface gradients. However, planar VTSs have challenges when
extended to curved surfaces, including insufficient lighting of surfaces,
blurring in reconstruction, and complex spatial boundary conditions for surface
structures. With an end goal of constructing a human-like fingertip, our
research (i) develops GelSplitter3D by expanding imaging channels with a prism
and a near-infrared (NIR) camera, (ii) proposes a photometric stereo neural
network with a CAD-based normal ground truth generation method to calibrate
tactile geometry, and (iii) devises a normal integration method with boundary
constraints of depth prior information to correcting the cumulative error of
surface integrals. We demonstrate better tactile sensing performance, a 40$\%$
improvement in normal estimation accuracy, and the benefits of sensor shapes in
grasping and manipulation tasks.

Abstract: We present DyNaVLM, an end-to-end vision-language navigation framework using
Vision-Language Models (VLM). In contrast to prior methods constrained by fixed
angular or distance intervals, our system empowers agents to freely select
navigation targets via visual-language reasoning. At its core lies a
self-refining graph memory that 1) stores object locations as executable
topological relations, 2) enables cross-robot memory sharing through
distributed graph updates, and 3) enhances VLM's decision-making via retrieval
augmentation. Operating without task-specific training or fine-tuning, DyNaVLM
demonstrates high performance on GOAT and ObjectNav benchmarks. Real-world
tests further validate its robustness and generalization. The system's three
innovations: dynamic action space formulation, collaborative graph memory, and
training-free deployment, establish a new paradigm for scalable embodied robot,
bridging the gap between discrete VLN tasks and continuous real-world

Abstract: In this study, we present a novel simultaneous localization and mapping
(SLAM) system, VIMS, designed for underwater navigation. Conventional
visual-inertial state estimators encounter significant practical challenges in
perceptually degraded underwater environments, particularly in scale estimation
and loop closing. To address these issues, we first propose leveraging a
low-cost single-beam sonar to improve scale estimation. Then, VIMS integrates a
high-sampling-rate magnetometer for place recognition by utilizing magnetic
signatures generated by an economical magnetic field coil. Building on this, a
hierarchical scheme is developed for visual-magnetic place recognition,
enabling robust loop closure. Furthermore, VIMS achieves a balance between
local feature tracking and descriptor-based loop closing, avoiding additional
computational burden on the front end. Experimental results highlight the
efficacy of the proposed VIMS, demonstrating significant improvements in both
the robustness and accuracy of state estimation within underwater environments.

Conclusion: 结合视觉和触觉输入显著提高了涉及广泛和精细接触的操作的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Manipulation with whole-body contact by humanoid robots offers distinct
advantages, including enhanced stability and reduced load. On the other hand,
we need to address challenges such as the increased computational cost of
motion generation and the difficulty of measuring broad-area contact. We
therefore have developed a humanoid control system that allows a humanoid robot
equipped with tactile sensors on its upper body to learn a policy for
whole-body manipulation through imitation learning based on human teleoperation
data. This policy, named tactile-modality extended ACT (TACT), has a feature to
take multiple sensor modalities as input, including joint position, vision, and
tactile measurements. Furthermore, by integrating this policy with retargeting
and locomotion control based on a biped model, we demonstrate that the
life-size humanoid robot RHP7 Kaleido is capable of achieving whole-body
contact manipulation while maintaining balance and walking. Through detailed
experimental verification, we show that inputting both vision and tactile
modalities into the policy contributes to improving the robustness of
manipulation involving broad and delicate contact.

Abstract: Gait phase estimation based on inertial measurement unit (IMU) signals
facilitates precise adaptation of exoskeletons to individual gait variations.
However, challenges remain in achieving high accuracy and robustness,
particularly during periods of terrain changes. To address this, we develop a
gait phase estimation neural network based on implicit modeling of human
locomotion, which combines temporal convolution for feature extraction with
transformer layers for multi-channel information fusion. A channel-wise masked
reconstruction pre-training strategy is proposed, which first treats gait phase
state vectors and IMU signals as joint observations of human locomotion, thus
enhancing model generalization. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed method outperforms existing baseline approaches, achieving a gait
phase RMSE of $2.729 \pm 1.071%$ and phase rate MAE of $0.037 \pm 0.016%$ under
stable terrain conditions with a look-back window of 2 seconds, and a phase
RMSE of $3.215 \pm 1.303%$ and rate MAE of $0.050 \pm 0.023%$ under terrain
transitions. Hardware validation on a hip exoskeleton further confirms that the
algorithm can reliably identify gait cycles and key events, adapting to various
continuous motion scenarios. This research paves the way for more intelligent
and adaptive exoskeleton systems, enabling safer and more efficient human-robot
interaction across diverse real-world environments.

Motivation: LLM在机器人领域的即时策略存在幻觉问题，导致生成的轨迹偏离演示，影响可靠性。

Method: RIP利用Student's t分布聚合LLM生成的候选轨迹，忽略异常值（幻觉），生成鲁棒轨迹。

Result: 实验表明，RIP在低数据场景下任务成功率至少提升26%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RIP通过鲁棒性设计有效解决了LLM在模仿学习中的幻觉问题，提升了任务可靠性。

Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) aims to enable robots to perform tasks autonomously
by observing a few human demonstrations. Recently, a variant of IL, called
In-Context IL, utilized off-the-shelf large language models (LLMs) as instant
policies that understand the context from a few given demonstrations to perform
a new task, rather than explicitly updating network models with large-scale
demonstrations. However, its reliability in the robotics domain is undermined
by hallucination issues such as LLM-based instant policy, which occasionally
generates poor trajectories that deviate from the given demonstrations. To
alleviate this problem, we propose a new robust in-context imitation learning
algorithm called the robust instant policy (RIP), which utilizes a Student's
t-regression model to be robust against the hallucinated trajectories of
instant policies to allow reliable trajectory generation. Specifically, RIP
generates several candidate robot trajectories to complete a given task from an
LLM and aggregates them using the Student's t-distribution, which is beneficial
for ignoring outliers (i.e., hallucinations); thereby, a robust trajectory
against hallucinations is generated. Our experiments, conducted in both
simulated and real-world environments, show that RIP significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art IL methods, with at least $26\%$ improvement in task success
rates, particularly in low-data scenarios for everyday tasks. Video results

### [235] [SHeRLoc: Synchronized Heterogeneous Radar Place Recognition for Cross-Modal Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15175)
*Hanjun Kim,Minwoo Jung,Wooseong Yang,Ayoung Kim*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SHeRLoc是一种专为异构雷达设计的深度网络，通过RCS极坐标匹配和多尺度特征聚合，显著提升了异构雷达地点识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多局限于同质雷达传感器，忽视了异构雷达技术的集成与跨模态挑战，导致难以泛化到多样雷达数据类型。

Method: 提出SHeRLoc，利用RCS极坐标匹配对齐多模态雷达数据，采用分层最优传输特征聚合生成旋转鲁棒的多尺度描述符，并通过FFT相似性数据挖掘和自适应三元组损失实现FOV感知度量学习。

Result: 在公开数据集上，SHeRLoc将异构雷达地点识别的recall@1从低于0.1提升至0.9，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SHeRLoc不仅适用于雷达，还可推广到LiDAR，为跨模态地点识别和异构传感器SLAM开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Despite the growing adoption of radar in robotics, the majority of research
has been confined to homogeneous sensor types, overlooking the integration and
cross-modality challenges inherent in heterogeneous radar technologies. This
leads to significant difficulties in generalizing across diverse radar data
types, with modality-aware approaches that could leverage the complementary
strengths of heterogeneous radar remaining unexplored. To bridge these gaps, we
propose SHeRLoc, the first deep network tailored for heterogeneous radar, which
utilizes RCS polar matching to align multimodal radar data. Our hierarchical
optimal transport-based feature aggregation method generates rotationally
robust multi-scale descriptors. By employing FFT-similarity-based data mining
and adaptive margin-based triplet loss, SHeRLoc enables FOV-aware metric
learning. SHeRLoc achieves an order of magnitude improvement in heterogeneous
radar place recognition, increasing recall@1 from below 0.1 to 0.9 on a public
dataset and outperforming state of-the-art methods. Also applicable to LiDAR,
SHeRLoc paves the way for cross-modal place recognition and heterogeneous
sensor SLAM. The source code will be available upon acceptance.

### [236] [Context-Aware Deep Lagrangian Networks for Model Predictive Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15249)
*Lucas Schulze,Jan Peters,Oleg Arenz*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于物理模型的上下文感知机器人控制方法，结合在线系统识别和模型预测控制，显著提高了轨迹跟踪精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在复杂环境中，全局物理模型难以适用，需要开发上下文感知模型以捕捉当前环境的相关特性。

Method: 扩展了DeLaN模型，使其具有上下文感知能力，结合循环网络进行在线系统识别，并与MPC集成。同时引入残差动力学模型以利用机器人名义模型。

Result: 在7自由度机械臂的轨迹跟踪实验中，新方法将末端执行器跟踪误差降低了39%，优于基线方法的21%改进。

Conclusion: 上下文感知的物理模型结合在线识别和MPC，能够有效提升复杂环境中的机器人控制性能。

Abstract: Controlling a robot based on physics-informed dynamic models, such as deep
Lagrangian networks (DeLaN), can improve the generalizability and
interpretability of the resulting behavior. However, in complex environments,
the number of objects to potentially interact with is vast, and their physical
properties are often uncertain. This complexity makes it infeasible to employ a
single global model. Therefore, we need to resort to online system
identification of context-aware models that capture only the currently relevant
aspects of the environment. While physical principles such as the conservation
of energy may not hold across varying contexts, ensuring physical plausibility
for any individual context-aware model can still be highly desirable,
particularly when using it for receding horizon control methods such as Model
Predictive Control (MPC). Hence, in this work, we extend DeLaN to make it
context-aware, combine it with a recurrent network for online system
identification, and integrate it with a MPC for adaptive, physics-informed
control. We also combine DeLaN with a residual dynamics model to leverage the
fact that a nominal model of the robot is typically available. We evaluate our
method on a 7-DOF robot arm for trajectory tracking under varying loads. Our
method reduces the end-effector tracking error by 39%, compared to a 21%
improvement achieved by a baseline that uses an extended Kalman filter.

Abstract: Offensive Robot Cybersecurity introduces a groundbreaking approach by
advocating for offensive security methods empowered by means of automation. It
emphasizes the necessity of understanding attackers' tactics and identifying
vulnerabilities in advance to develop effective defenses, thereby improving
robots' security posture. This thesis leverages a decade of robotics
experience, employing Machine Learning and Game Theory to streamline the
vulnerability identification and exploitation process. Intrinsically, the
thesis uncovers a profound connection between robotic architecture and
cybersecurity, highlighting that the design and creation aspect of robotics
deeply intertwines with its protection against attacks. This duality -- whereby
the architecture that shapes robot behavior and capabilities also necessitates
a defense mechanism through offensive and defensive cybersecurity strategies --
creates a unique equilibrium. Approaching cybersecurity with a dual perspective
of defense and attack, rooted in an understanding of systems architecture, has
been pivotal. Through comprehensive analysis, including ethical considerations,
the development of security tools, and executing cyber attacks on robot
software, hardware, and industry deployments, this thesis proposes a novel
architecture for cybersecurity cognitive engines. These engines, powered by
advanced game theory and machine learning, pave the way for autonomous
offensive cybersecurity strategies for robots, marking a significant shift
towards self-defending robotic systems. This research not only underscores the
importance of offensive measures in enhancing robot cybersecurity but also sets
the stage for future advancements where robots are not just resilient to cyber
threats but are equipped to autonomously safeguard themselves.

Motivation: 提升水下滑翔机在放射性源探测任务中的效率，同时确保安全导航。

Method: 评估了TSP、MST和OCP三种路径规划方法，通过MATLAB模拟比较处理时间、未覆盖区域、路径长度和遍历时间。

Result: OCP在时间受限时表现最佳但计算成本高，MST更快但次优。

Conclusion: 根据任务优先级选择算法，平衡效率与计算可行性。

Abstract: In many applications, including underwater robotics, the coverage problem
requires an autonomous vehicle to systematically explore a defined area while
minimizing redundancy and avoiding obstacles. This paper investigates coverage
path planning strategies to enhance the efficiency of underwater gliders,
particularly in maximizing the probability of detecting a radioactive source
while ensuring safe navigation.
  We evaluate three path-planning approaches: the Traveling Salesman Problem
(TSP), Minimum Spanning Tree (MST), and Optimal Control Problem (OCP).
Simulations were conducted in MATLAB, comparing processing time, uncovered
areas, path length, and traversal time. Results indicate that OCP is preferable
when traversal time is constrained, although it incurs significantly higher
computational costs. Conversely, MST-based approaches provide faster but less
optimal solutions. These findings offer insights into selecting appropriate
algorithms based on mission priorities, balancing efficiency and computational
feasibility.

TL;DR: 提出了一种分层强化学习框架，用于移动机械臂在可移动障碍物环境中的高效导航，结合交互式障碍物属性估计和结构化推动策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在动态环境中导航时遇到未预见障碍物的挑战，同时保持全局路径规划的准确性。

Method: 采用分层强化学习框架，高层策略生成考虑环境约束的推动命令，低层策略通过全身协调运动精确执行。

Result: 实验显示在可移动障碍物导航任务中，成功率提高、路径长度缩短、到达时间减少。

Conclusion: 框架有效提升了导航效率，并通过消融实验和定性分析验证了各组件的作用和实时估计的准确性。

Abstract: We propose a hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) framework for
efficient Navigation Among Movable Obstacles (NAMO) using a mobile manipulator.
Our approach combines interaction-based obstacle property estimation with
structured pushing strategies, facilitating the dynamic manipulation of
unforeseen obstacles while adhering to a pre-planned global path. The
high-level policy generates pushing commands that consider environmental
constraints and path-tracking objectives, while the low-level policy precisely
and stably executes these commands through coordinated whole-body movements.
Comprehensive simulation-based experiments demonstrate improvements in
performing NAMO tasks, including higher success rates, shortened traversed path
length, and reduced goal-reaching times, compared to baselines. Additionally,
ablation studies assess the efficacy of each component, while a qualitative
analysis further validates the accuracy and reliability of the real-time
obstacle property estimation.

*Miaoxin Pan,Jinnan Li,Yaowen Zhang,Yi Yang,Yufeng Yue*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MCOO-SLAM是一种多相机全向物体SLAM系统，利用环绕视角相机配置实现复杂户外场景中的鲁棒、一致且语义丰富的建图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SLAM方法依赖RGB-D或单目相机，视野窄、易受遮挡且深度感知有限，导致物体建模不准确和数据关联不可靠。

Method: 整合点特征和物体级地标，采用语义-几何-时间融合策略进行多视角物体关联，设计全向闭环模块实现视角不变的地点识别。

Result: 实验表明，MCOO-SLAM在真实场景中实现了精确定位和可扩展的物体级建图，对遮挡、姿态变化和环境复杂性具有更强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MCOO-SLAM通过多相机配置和语义增强，显著提升了复杂户外场景中的物体级SLAM性能。

Abstract: Object-level SLAM offers structured and semantically meaningful environment
representations, making it more interpretable and suitable for high-level
robotic tasks. However, most existing approaches rely on RGB-D sensors or
monocular views, which suffer from narrow fields of view, occlusion
sensitivity, and limited depth perception-especially in large-scale or outdoor
environments. These limitations often restrict the system to observing only
partial views of objects from limited perspectives, leading to inaccurate
object modeling and unreliable data association. In this work, we propose
MCOO-SLAM, a novel Multi-Camera Omnidirectional Object SLAM system that fully
leverages surround-view camera configurations to achieve robust, consistent,
and semantically enriched mapping in complex outdoor scenarios. Our approach
integrates point features and object-level landmarks enhanced with
open-vocabulary semantics. A semantic-geometric-temporal fusion strategy is
introduced for robust object association across multiple views, leading to
improved consistency and accurate object modeling, and an omnidirectional loop
closure module is designed to enable viewpoint-invariant place recognition
using scene-level descriptors. Furthermore, the constructed map is abstracted
into a hierarchical 3D scene graph to support downstream reasoning tasks.
Extensive experiments in real-world demonstrate that MCOO-SLAM achieves
accurate localization and scalable object-level mapping with improved
robustness to occlusion, pose variation, and environmental complexity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有水上-空中机器人难以同时高效执行水下、水面和空中运动，需要一种更灵活的解决方案。

Method: 设计了差动推力矢量水翼，结合水下导航、水面滑行和空中飞行功能，开发了相应的控制算法。

Result: SurfAAV实现了水面滑行速度7.96 m/s和水下速度3.1 m/s，性能优于现有机器人。

Conclusion: SurfAAV为水下、水面和空中运动提供了新解决方案，验证了其高效性和灵活性。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in the research of aquatic-aerial robots,
existing configurations struggle to efficiently perform underwater, surface,
and aerial movement simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a novel
multimodal surfing aquatic-aerial vehicle, SurfAAV, which efficiently
integrates underwater navigation, surface gliding, and aerial flying
capabilities. Thanks to the design of the novel differential thrust vectoring
hydrofoil, SurfAAV can achieve efficient surface gliding and underwater
navigation without the need for a buoyancy adjustment system. This design
provides flexible operational capabilities for both surface and underwater
tasks, enabling the robot to quickly carry out underwater monitoring
activities. Additionally, when it is necessary to reach another water body,
SurfAAV can switch to aerial mode through a gliding takeoff, flying to the
target water area to perform corresponding tasks. The main contribution of this
letter lies in proposing a new solution for underwater, surface, and aerial
movement, designing a novel hybrid prototype concept, developing the required
control laws, and validating the robot's ability to successfully perform
surface gliding and gliding takeoff. SurfAAV achieves a maximum surface gliding
speed of 7.96 m/s and a maximum underwater speed of 3.1 m/s. The prototype's
surface gliding maneuverability and underwater cruising maneuverability both
exceed those of existing aquatic-aerial vehicles.

Motivation: 解决UWB辅助导航系统中未知锚点的自动检测和校准问题，提升实际应用的鲁棒性。

Method: 结合在线PDOP估计、轻量级异常检测方法和自适应鲁棒核进行非线性优化。

Result: 在自动叉车和四旋翼机器人上验证，显示初始化鲁棒且定位误差低。

Conclusion: 方法优于现有技术，适用于实际应用，代码已开源。

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for the real-time initialization of unknown
Ultra-Wideband (UWB) anchors in UWB-aided navigation systems. The method is
designed for localization solutions where UWB modules act as supplementary
sensors. Our approach enables the automatic detection and calibration of
previously unknown anchors during operation, removing the need for manual
setup. By combining an online Positional Dilution of Precision (PDOP)
estimation, a lightweight outlier detection method, and an adaptive robust
kernel for non-linear optimization, our approach significantly improves
robustness and suitability for real-world applications compared to
state-of-the-art. In particular, we show that our metric which triggers an
initialization decision is more conservative than current ones commonly based
on initial linear or non-linear initialization guesses. This allows for better
initialization geometry and subsequently lower initialization errors. We
demonstrate the proposed approach on two different mobile robots: an autonomous
forklift and a quadcopter equipped with a UWB-aided Visual-Inertial Odometry
(VIO) framework. The results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed method
with robust initialization and low positioning error. We open-source our code
in a C++ library including a ROS wrapper.

Conclusion: 该框架显著提高了空中操作任务的灵活性和效率。

Abstract: The workspace limits the operational capabilities and range of motion for the
systems with robotic arms. Maximizing workspace utilization has the potential
to provide more optimal solutions for aerial manipulation tasks, increasing the
system's flexibility and operational efficiency. In this paper, we introduce a
novel planning framework for aerial grasping that maximizes workspace
utilization. We formulate an optimization problem to optimize the aerial
manipulator's trajectory, incorporating task constraints to achieve efficient
manipulation. To address the challenge of incorporating the delta arm's
non-convex workspace into optimization constraints, we leverage a Multilayer
Perceptron (MLP) to map position points to feasibility
probabilities.Furthermore, we employ Reversible Residual Networks (RevNet) to
approximate the complex forward kinematics of the delta arm, utilizing
efficient model gradients to eliminate workspace constraints. We validate our
methods in simulations and real-world experiments to demonstrate their
effectiveness.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GRIM是一种无需训练的任务导向抓取框架，通过几何线索和PCA降维的DINO特征进行粗对齐，再结合任务无关的几何稳定抓取进行细化，表现出强大的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 任务导向抓取（TOG）需要理解任务语义、对象功能及抓取约束，现有学习方法泛化能力有限，GRIM旨在解决这一问题。

Method: GRIM采用粗对齐策略（几何线索+PCA降维DINO特征），再通过任务无关的几何稳定抓取细化，优先任务兼容性。

Result: GRIM仅需少量示例即表现出强大的泛化能力，性能优于现有学习方法。

Conclusion: GRIM为任务导向抓取提供了一种高效、泛化性强的解决方案。

Abstract: Task-Oriented Grasping (TOG) presents a significant challenge, requiring a
nuanced understanding of task semantics, object affordances, and the functional
constraints dictating how an object should be grasped for a specific task. To
address these challenges, we introduce GRIM (Grasp Re-alignment via Iterative
Matching), a novel training-free framework for task-oriented grasping.
Initially, a coarse alignment strategy is developed using a combination of
geometric cues and principal component analysis (PCA)-reduced DINO features for
similarity scoring. Subsequently, the full grasp pose associated with the
retrieved memory instance is transferred to the aligned scene object and
further refined against a set of task-agnostic, geometrically stable grasps
generated for the scene object, prioritizing task compatibility. In contrast to
existing learning-based methods, GRIM demonstrates strong generalization
capabilities, achieving robust performance with only a small number of
conditioning examples.

Conclusion: ViA通过结合硬件设计和VR界面，成功学习了人类活动感知策略，为复杂机器人操作任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We present Vision in Action (ViA), an active perception system for bimanual
robot manipulation. ViA learns task-relevant active perceptual strategies
(e.g., searching, tracking, and focusing) directly from human demonstrations.
On the hardware side, ViA employs a simple yet effective 6-DoF robotic neck to
enable flexible, human-like head movements. To capture human active perception
strategies, we design a VR-based teleoperation interface that creates a shared
observation space between the robot and the human operator. To mitigate VR
motion sickness caused by latency in the robot's physical movements, the
interface uses an intermediate 3D scene representation, enabling real-time view
rendering on the operator side while asynchronously updating the scene with the
robot's latest observations. Together, these design elements enable the
learning of robust visuomotor policies for three complex, multi-stage bimanual
manipulation tasks involving visual occlusions, significantly outperforming
baseline systems.

Conclusion: 该方法在目标驱动的物体操作任务中展示了实用性，为可变形物体的建模提供了新思路。

Abstract: Modeling the dynamics of deformable objects is challenging due to their
diverse physical properties and the difficulty of estimating states from
limited visual information. We address these challenges with a neural dynamics
framework that combines object particles and spatial grids in a hybrid
representation. Our particle-grid model captures global shape and motion
information while predicting dense particle movements, enabling the modeling of
objects with varied shapes and materials. Particles represent object shapes,
while the spatial grid discretizes the 3D space to ensure spatial continuity
and enhance learning efficiency. Coupled with Gaussian Splattings for visual
rendering, our framework achieves a fully learning-based digital twin of
deformable objects and generates 3D action-conditioned videos. Through
experiments, we demonstrate that our model learns the dynamics of diverse
objects -- such as ropes, cloths, stuffed animals, and paper bags -- from
sparse-view RGB-D recordings of robot-object interactions, while also
generalizing at the category level to unseen instances. Our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art learning-based and physics-based simulators,
particularly in scenarios with limited camera views. Furthermore, we showcase
the utility of our learned models in model-based planning, enabling
goal-conditioned object manipulation across a range of tasks. The project page

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于被动声学监测的野生动物研究方法，利用自动化录音设备（ARUs）收集数据，并通过pycnet-audio工具实现自动化信号检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统手动处理大规模声学数据效率低下，需要一种自动化方法来高效分析野生动物声音及其他信号。

Method: 使用自动化录音设备（ARUs）长期记录野外声音，结合PNW-Cnet模型扩展的pycnet-audio工具进行自动化信号检测。

Result: PNW-Cnet模型已扩展至检测约80种森林野生动物声音及多种人为和环境噪声。

Conclusion: pycnet-audio为声学数据提供了一种实用的自动化处理流程，适用于大规模野生动物监测项目。

Abstract: Passive acoustic monitoring is an emerging approach in wildlife research that
leverages recent improvements in purpose-made automated recording units (ARUs).
The general approach is to deploy ARUs in the field to record on a programmed
schedule for extended periods (weeks or months), after which the audio data are
retrieved. These data must then be processed, typically either by measuring or
analyzing characteristics of the audio itself (e.g. calculating acoustic
indices), or by searching for some signal of interest within the recordings,
e.g. vocalizations or other sounds produced by some target species,
anthropogenic or environmental noise, etc. In the latter case, some method is
required to locate the signal(s) of interest within the audio. While very small
datasets can simply be searched manually, even modest projects can produce
audio datasets on the order of 105 hours of recordings, making manual review
impractical and necessitating some form of automated detection. pycnet-audio
(Ruff 2024) is intended to provide a practical processing workflow for acoustic
data, built around the PNW-Cnet model, which was initially developed by the
U.S. Forest Service to support population monitoring of northern spotted owls
(Strix occidentalis caurina) and other forest owls (Lesmeister and Jenkins
2022; Ruff et al. 2020). PNW-Cnet has been expanded to detect vocalizations of
ca. 80 forest wildlife species and numerous forms of anthropogenic and
environmental noise (Ruff et al. 2021, 2023).

Abstract: Speech enhancement, particularly denoising, is vital in improving the
intelligibility and quality of speech signals for real-world applications,
especially in noisy environments. While prior research has introduced various
deep learning models for this purpose, many struggle to balance noise
suppression, perceptual quality, and speaker-specific feature preservation,
leaving a critical research gap in their comparative performance evaluation.
This study benchmarks three state-of-the-art models Wave-U-Net, CMGAN, and
U-Net, on diverse datasets such as SpEAR, VPQAD, and Clarkson datasets. These
models were chosen due to their relevance in the literature and code
accessibility. The evaluation reveals that U-Net achieves high noise
suppression with SNR improvements of +71.96% on SpEAR, +64.83% on VPQAD, and
+364.2% on the Clarkson dataset. CMGAN outperforms in perceptual quality,
attaining the highest PESQ scores of 4.04 on SpEAR and 1.46 on VPQAD, making it
well-suited for applications prioritizing natural and intelligible speech.
Wave-U-Net balances these attributes with improvements in speaker-specific
feature retention, evidenced by VeriSpeak score gains of +10.84% on SpEAR and
+27.38% on VPQAD. This research indicates how advanced methods can optimize
trade-offs between noise suppression, perceptual quality, and speaker
recognition. The findings may contribute to advancing voice biometrics,
forensic audio analysis, telecommunication, and speaker verification in
challenging acoustic conditions.

Abstract: Detailed captions that accurately reflect the characteristics of a music
piece can enrich music databases and drive forward research in music AI. This
paper introduces a multi-task music captioning model, SonicVerse, that
integrates caption generation with auxiliary music feature detection tasks such
as key detection, vocals detection, and more, so as to directly capture both
low-level acoustic details as well as high-level musical attributes. The key
contribution is a projection-based architecture that transforms audio input
into language tokens, while simultaneously detecting music features through
dedicated auxiliary heads. The outputs of these heads are also projected into
language tokens, to enhance the captioning input. This framework not only
produces rich, descriptive captions for short music fragments but also directly
enables the generation of detailed time-informed descriptions for longer music
pieces, by chaining the outputs using a large-language model. To train the
model, we extended the MusicBench dataset by annotating it with music features
using MIRFLEX, a modular music feature extractor, resulting in paired audio,
captions and music feature data. Experimental results show that incorporating
features in this way improves the quality and detail of the generated captions.

TL;DR: 论文研究了音乐源分离对自动歌词转录（ALT）的影响，使用Whisper模型评估了不同音频输入的效果，并提出改进方法，显著降低了词错误率（WER）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管ASR技术因Transformer架构取得进展，但ALT仍面临音乐伴奏干扰的挑战。音乐源分离技术的进步为提升ALT性能提供了可能，但其影响尚未系统研究。

Method: 使用Whisper模型评估原始音频、分离人声和人声干音的效果，提出短转录拼接方法和长转录分段算法。

Result: 短转录拼接方法降低了WER；长转录分段算法优于Whisper原生方法，并在Jam-ALT基准测试中达到开源系统最佳效果。

Conclusion: 音乐源分离可显著提升ALT性能，无需训练或微调；同时发布了首个公开的长转录歌词数据集MUSDB-ALT。

Abstract: Automatic lyrics transcription (ALT) remains a challenging task in the field
of music information retrieval, despite great advances in automatic speech
recognition (ASR) brought about by transformer-based architectures in recent
years. One of the major challenges in ALT is the high amplitude of interfering
audio signals relative to conventional ASR due to musical accompaniment. Recent
advances in music source separation have enabled automatic extraction of
high-quality separated vocals, which could potentially improve ALT performance.
However, the effect of source separation has not been systematically
investigated in order to establish best practices for its use. This work
examines the impact of source separation on ALT using Whisper, a
state-of-the-art open source ASR model. We evaluate Whisper's performance on
original audio, separated vocals, and vocal stems across short-form and
long-form transcription tasks. For short-form, we suggest a concatenation
method that results in a consistent reduction in Word Error Rate (WER). For
long-form, we propose an algorithm using source separation as a vocal activity
detector to derive segment boundaries, which results in a consistent reduction
in WER relative to Whisper's native long-form algorithm. Our approach achieves
state-of-the-art results for an open source system on the Jam-ALT long-form ALT
benchmark, without any training or fine-tuning. We also publish MUSDB-ALT, the
first dataset of long-form lyric transcripts following the Jam-ALT guidelines
for which vocal stems are publicly available.

Result: 该方法无需额外训练模型，且不影响生成速度，成功实现了乐器音色的调整。

Conclusion: 通过选择合适的时间步长，可以在保留音频内容的同时有效编辑乐器音色，为音乐创作提供了新工具。

Abstract: Breakthroughs in text-to-music generation models are transforming the
creative landscape, equipping musicians with innovative tools for composition
and experimentation like never before. However, controlling the generation
process to achieve a specific desired outcome remains a significant challenge.
Even a minor change in the text prompt, combined with the same random seed, can
drastically alter the generated piece. In this paper, we explore the
application of existing text-to-music diffusion models for instrument editing.
Specifically, for an existing audio track, we aim to leverage a pretrained
text-to-music diffusion model to edit the instrument while preserving the
underlying content. Based on the insight that the model first focuses on the
overall structure or content of the audio, then adds instrument information,
and finally refines the quality, we show that selecting a well-chosen
intermediate timestep, identified through an instrument classifier, yields a
balance between preserving the original piece's content and achieving the
desired timbre. Our method does not require additional training of the
text-to-music diffusion model, nor does it compromise the generation process's
speed.

Motivation: 许多音乐AI模型依赖人工标注的标签，但音乐内容本身可以作为自然表达方式，因此提出一种音乐对音乐的序列建模范式。

Method: 使用预训练语言模型处理参考和目标序列，并通过轻量级适配器连接两者。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在和弦识别、旋律生成和鼓轨生成等任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了多种音乐任务的统一建模，且性能优越，代码和模型权重已公开。

Abstract: Many music AI models learn a map between music content and human-defined
labels. However, many annotations, such as chords, can be naturally expressed
within the music modality itself, e.g., as sequences of symbolic notes. This
observation enables both understanding tasks (e.g., chord recognition) and
conditional generation tasks (e.g., chord-conditioned melody generation) to be
unified under a music-for-music sequence modeling paradigm. In this work, we
propose parameter-efficient solutions for a variety of symbolic music-for-music
tasks. The high-level idea is that (1) we utilize a pretrained Language Model
(LM) for both the reference and the target sequence and (2) we link these two
LMs via a lightweight adapter. Experiments show that our method achieves
superior performance among different tasks such as chord recognition, melody
generation, and drum track generation. All demos, code and model weights are
publicly available.

TL;DR: TTSOps是一个自动化闭环框架，用于从嘈杂的网络语音数据构建多说话人TTS系统，通过动态数据选择和清理提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统TTS系统依赖高质量标注数据，限制了可扩展性和说话人多样性。TTSOps旨在利用现代TTS模型的噪声鲁棒性，挖掘低质量但信息丰富的样本。

Method: TTSOps结合自动化数据收集、动态数据清理方法选择和基于预测MOS的评估闭环，联合优化数据和模型。

Result: 在日语YouTube数据上的实验表明，TTSOps在自然度和说话人多样性上优于传统方法。

Conclusion: TTSOps通过数据驱动的闭环优化，显著提升了TTS系统的性能和实用性。

Abstract: This paper presents TTSOps, a fully automated closed-loop framework for
constructing multi-speaker text-to-speech (TTS) systems from noisy, uncurated
web-scale speech data, often referred to as ``dark data,'' such as online
videos. Conventional TTS training pipelines require well-curated corpora with
high acoustic quality and accurate text-speech alignment, which severely limits
scalability, speaker diversity, and real-world applicability. While recent
studies have proposed acoustic-quality-based data selection techniques, they
often overlook two critical aspects: (1) the inherent robustness of modern TTS
models to noise, and (2) the potential contribution of perceptually low-quality
yet informative samples. To address these issues, TTSOps introduces a
data-centric training pipeline that integrates three core components: (1)
automated data collection from dark data sources, (2) utterance-level dynamic
selection of data cleansing methods based on training data quality, and (3)
evaluation-in-the-loop data selection using automatically predicted mean
opinion scores (MOS) to estimate each utterance's impact on model performance.
Furthermore, TTSOps jointly optimizes the corpus and the TTS model in a
closed-loop framework by dynamically adapting both data selection and data
cleansing processes to the characteristics of the target TTS model. Extensive
experiments on Japanese YouTube data demonstrate that TTSOps outperforms
conventional acoustic-quality-based baselines in both the naturalness and
speaker diversity of synthesized speech.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前转录组基础模型（TFMs）的多样性和训练策略差异导致难以评估设计选择的影响或协同效应，限制了领域内的最佳实践和研究的可重复性。

Method: 提出了BMFM-RNA框架，支持多种输入表示和训练目标，包括新的WCED目标，并通过预训练和微调评估模型性能。

Result: WCED模型在零样本和微调任务中表现优于或匹配现有方法（如scGPT）。

Conclusion: BMFM-RNA为系统基准测试和社区驱动的TFM训练策略探索提供了可重复的基础，有助于开发更有效的工具以理解细胞生物学。

Abstract: Transcriptomic foundation models (TFMs) have recently emerged as powerful
tools for analyzing gene expression in cells and tissues, supporting key tasks
such as cell-type annotation, batch correction, and perturbation prediction.
However, the diversity of model implementations and training strategies across
recent TFMs, though promising, makes it challenging to isolate the contribution
of individual design choices or evaluate their potential synergies. This
hinders the field's ability to converge on best practices and limits the
reproducibility of insights across studies. We present BMFM-RNA, an
open-source, modular software package that unifies diverse TFM pretraining and
fine-tuning objectives within a single framework. Leveraging this capability,
we introduce a novel training objective, whole cell expression decoder (WCED),
which captures global expression patterns using an autoencoder-like CLS
bottleneck representation. In this paper, we describe the framework, supported
input representations, and training objectives. We evaluated four model
checkpoints pretrained on CELLxGENE using combinations of masked language
modeling (MLM), WCED and multitask learning. Using the benchmarking
capabilities of BMFM-RNA, we show that WCED-based models achieve performance
that matches or exceeds state-of-the-art approaches like scGPT across more than
a dozen datasets in both zero-shot and fine-tuning tasks. BMFM-RNA, available
as part of the biomed-multi-omics project (
https://github.com/BiomedSciAI/biomed-multi-omic ), offers a reproducible
foundation for systematic benchmarking and community-driven exploration of
optimal TFM training strategies, enabling the development of more effective
tools to leverage the latest advances in AI for understanding cell biology.

Motivation: 层次图的树状分支结构对传统图滤波器设计提出了挑战，需要一种新的方法来处理这种结构。

Method: 引入边界加权算子，利用Busemann函数在delta-双曲网络上证明其谱范数的上界。

Result: 证明了信号在每次传递时会损失曲率控制的能量，提供了一种稳定的滤波器。

Conclusion: 该算子为具有密集或隐藏层次结构的数据提供了一种新的图信号处理工具。

Abstract: Hierarchical graphs often exhibit tree-like branching patterns, a structural
property that challenges the design of traditional graph filters. We introduce
a boundary-weighted operator that rescales each edge according to how far its
endpoints drift toward the graph's Gromov boundary. Using Busemann functions on
delta-hyperbolic networks, we prove a closed-form upper bound on the operator's
spectral norm: every signal loses a curvature-controlled fraction of its energy
at each pass. The result delivers a parameter-free, lightweight filter whose
stability follows directly from geometric first principles, offering a new
analytic tool for graph signal processing on data with dense or hidden
hierarchical structure.

Conclusion: ChatModel展示了在参考模型生成与验证自动化方面的巨大潜力。

Abstract: As the complexity of integrated circuit designs continues to escalate, the
functional verification becomes increasingly challenging. Reference models,
critical for accelerating the verification process, are themselves becoming
more intricate and time-consuming to develop. Despite the promise shown by
large language models (LLMs) in code programming, effectively generating
complex reference models remains a significant hurdle. To address these
challenges, we introduce ChatModel, the first LLM-aided agile reference model
generation and verification platform. ChatModel streamlines the transition from
design specifications to fully functional reference models by integrating
design standardization and hierarchical agile modeling. Employing a
building-block generation strategy, it not only enhances the design
capabilities of LLMs for reference models but also significantly boosts
verification efficiency. We evaluated ChatModel on 300 designs of varying
complexity, demonstrating substantial improvements in both efficiency and
quality of reference model generation. ChatModel achieved a peak performance
improvement of 55.02% compared to alternative methods, with notable
enhancements in generation stability, and delivered a 9.18x increase in its
capacity to produce reference model designs. Furthermore, it accelerated the
iterative process of reference model design and validation by an average of
5.90x compared to traditional approaches. These results highlight the potential
of ChatModel to significantly advance the automation of reference model
generation and validation.

Abstract: The explosive growth of Large Language Models (LLMs) - such as GPT-4 with 1.8
trillion parameters - demands a radical rethinking of data center architecture
to ensure scalability, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. Our work provides a
comprehensive co-design framework that jointly explores FLOPS, HBM bandwidth
and capacity, multiple network topologies (two-tier vs. FullFlat optical), the
size of the scale-out domain, and popular parallelism/optimization strategies
used in LLMs. We introduce and evaluate FullFlat network architectures, which
provide uniform high-bandwidth, low-latency connectivity between all nodes, and
demonstrate their transformative impact on performance and scalability. Through
detailed sensitivity analyses, we quantify the benefits of overlapping compute
and communication, leveraging hardware-accelerated collectives, wider scale-out
domains, and larger memory capacity. Our study spans both sparse (mixture of
experts) and dense transformer-based LLMs, revealing how system design choices
affect Model FLOPS Utilization (MFU = Model flops per token x Observed tokens
per sec / Peak flops of the hardware) and overall throughput. For the co-design
study, we extended and validated a performance modeling tool capable of
predicting LLM runtime within 10% of real-world measurements. Our findings
offer actionable insights and a practical roadmap for designing AI data centers

Methods: A set of training gradient waveforms were measured on a small animal
imaging system, and used to train a temporal convolutional network to predict
the gradient waveforms produced by the imaging system. Results: The trained
network was able to accurately predict nonlinear distortions produced by the
gradient system. Network prediction of gradient waveforms was incorporated into
the image reconstruction pipeline and provided improvements in image quality
and diffusion parameter mapping compared to both the nominal gradient waveform
and the gradient impulse response function. Conclusion: Temporal convolutional
networks can more accurately model gradient system behavior than existing
linear methods and may be used to retrospectively correct gradient errors.

Conclusion: 排序非凸惩罚在稀疏信号恢复中有效，提出的计算方法高效且实用。

Abstract: This work studies the problem of sparse signal recovery with automatic
grouping of variables. To this end, we investigate sorted nonsmooth penalties
as a regularization approach for generalized linear models. We focus on a
family of sorted nonconvex penalties which generalizes the Sorted L1 Norm
(SLOPE). These penalties are designed to promote clustering of variables due to
their sorted nature, while the nonconvexity reduces the shrinkage of
coefficients. Our goal is to provide efficient ways to compute their proximal
operator, enabling the use of popular proximal algorithms to solve composite
optimization problems with this choice of sorted penalties. We distinguish
between two classes of problems: the weakly convex case where computing the
proximal operator remains a convex problem, and the nonconvex case where
computing the proximal operator becomes a challenging nonconvex combinatorial
problem. For the weakly convex case (e.g. sorted MCP and SCAD), we explain how
the Pool Adjacent Violators (PAV) algorithm can exactly compute the proximal
operator. For the nonconvex case (e.g. sorted Lq with q in ]0,1[), we show that
a slight modification of this algorithm turns out to be remarkably efficient to
tackle the computation of the proximal operator. We also present new
theoretical insights on the minimizers of the nonconvex proximal problem. We
demonstrate the practical interest of using such penalties on several
experiments.

Conclusion: 提出的方法在非光滑目标下实现了最优的通信和计算复杂度，回答了开放性问题。

Abstract: We propose two first-order methods for convex, non-smooth, distributed
optimization problems, hereafter called Multi-Timescale Gradient Sliding
(MT-GS) and its accelerated variant (AMT-GS). Our MT-GS and AMT-GS can take
advantage of similarities between (local) objectives to reduce the
communication rounds, are flexible so that different subsets (of agents) can
communicate at different, user-picked rates, and are fully deterministic. These
three desirable features are achieved through a block-decomposable primal-dual
formulation, and a multi-timescale variant of the sliding method introduced in
Lan et al. (2020), Lan (2016), where different dual blocks are updated at
potentially different rates.
  To find an $\epsilon$-suboptimal solution, the complexities of our algorithms
achieve optimal dependency on $\epsilon$: MT-GS needs
$O(\overline{r}A/\epsilon)$ communication rounds and
$O(\overline{r}/\epsilon^2)$ subgradient steps for Lipchitz objectives, and
AMT-GS needs $O(\overline{r}A/\sqrt{\epsilon\mu})$ communication rounds and
$O(\overline{r}/(\epsilon\mu))$ subgradient steps if the objectives are also
$\mu$-strongly convex. Here, $\overline{r}$ measures the ``average rate of
updates'' for dual blocks, and $A$ measures similarities between (subgradients
of) local functions. In addition, the linear dependency of communication rounds
on $A$ is optimal (Arjevani and Shamir 2015), thereby providing a positive
answer to the open question whether such dependency is achievable for
non-smooth objectives (Arjevani and Shamir 2015).

Result: 使用Z特征图的QNN在仅四个输入参数下达到93%的预测准确率，优于经典方法。

Conclusion: QNNs在预测任务中表现优异，展示了QML在现实应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) is an emerging field at the intersection of
quantum computing and machine learning, aiming to enhance classical machine
learning methods by leveraging quantum mechanics principles such as
entanglement and superposition. However, skepticism persists regarding the
practical advantages of QML, mainly due to the current limitations of noisy

by extensively assessing Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs)-quantum-inspired
counterparts of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), demonstrating their
effectiveness compared to classical methods. We systematically construct and
evaluate twelve distinct QNN configurations, utilizing two unique quantum
feature maps combined with six different entanglement strategies for ansatz
design. Experiments conducted on a wind energy dataset reveal that QNNs
employing the Z feature map achieve up to 93% prediction accuracy when
forecasting wind power output using only four input parameters. Our findings
show that QNNs outperform classical methods in predictive tasks, underscoring
the potential of QML in real-world applications.

Conclusion: 通过正则化项优化QML，能够在电路切割与模型准确性之间找到平衡，为探索量子优势开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Whether QML can offer a transformative advantage remains an open question.
The severe constraints of NISQ hardware, particularly in circuit depth and
connectivity, hinder both the validation of quantum advantage and the empirical
investigation of major obstacles like barren plateaus. Circuit cutting
techniques have emerged as a strategy to execute larger quantum circuits on
smaller, less connected hardware by dividing them into subcircuits. However,
this partitioning increases the number of samples needed to estimate the
expectation value accurately through classical post-processing compared to
estimating it directly from the full circuit. This work introduces a novel
regularization term into the QML optimization process, directly penalizing the
overhead associated with sampling. We demonstrate that this approach enables
the optimizer to balance the advantages of gate cutting against the
optimization of the typical ML cost function. Specifically, it navigates the
trade-off between minimizing the cutting overhead and maintaining the overall
accuracy of the QML model, paving the way to study larger complex problems in
pursuit of quantum advantage.

Abstract: Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) modeling is a cornerstone
of computational drug discovery. This research demonstrates the successful
application of a Quantum Multiple Kernel Learning (QMKL) framework to enhance
QSAR classification, showing a notable performance improvement over classical
methods. We apply this methodology to a dataset for identifying DYRK1A kinase
inhibitors. The workflow involves converting SMILES representations into
numerical molecular descriptors, reducing dimensionality via Principal
Component Analysis (PCA), and employing a Support Vector Machine (SVM) trained
on an optimized combination of multiple quantum and classical kernels. By
benchmarking the QMKL-SVM against a classical Gradient Boosting model, we show
that the quantum-enhanced approach achieves a superior AUC score, highlighting
its potential to provide a quantum advantage in challenging cheminformatics
classification tasks.

*Tobias Schmidt,Kai-Robin Lange,Matthias Reccius,Henrik Müller,Michael Roos,Carsten Jentsch*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（如GPT-4）在提取经济叙事方面的潜力，并与专家标注的黄金标准进行比较，发现其表现虽有效但仍不及专家水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来，经济叙事的研究兴趣增加，但现有方法（如BERT）缺乏深层语义理解，无法区分经济叙事提取与传统任务（如语义角色标注）。

Method: 通过分析《华尔街日报》和《纽约时报》关于通胀的文章，应用严格的叙事定义，比较GPT-4输出与专家标注的黄金标准。

Result: GPT-4能以结构化格式提取有效的经济叙事，但在处理复杂文档和叙事时仍不及专家水平。

Conclusion: LLMs在经济研究中具有潜力，但需进一步改进以处理复杂任务，并提供了未来研究的指导。

Abstract: As interest in economic narratives has grown in recent years, so has the
number of pipelines dedicated to extracting such narratives from texts.
Pipelines often employ a mix of state-of-the-art natural language processing
techniques, such as BERT, to tackle this task. While effective on foundational
linguistic operations essential for narrative extraction, such models lack the
deeper semantic understanding required to distinguish extracting economic
narratives from merely conducting classic tasks like Semantic Role Labeling.
Instead of relying on complex model pipelines, we evaluate the benefits of
Large Language Models (LLMs) by analyzing a corpus of Wall Street Journal and
New York Times newspaper articles about inflation. We apply a rigorous
narrative definition and compare GPT-4o outputs to gold-standard narratives
produced by expert annotators. Our results suggests that GPT-4o is capable of
extracting valid economic narratives in a structured format, but still falls
short of expert-level performance when handling complex documents and
narratives. Given the novelty of LLMs in economic research, we also provide
guidance for future work in economics and the social sciences that employs LLMs
to pursue similar objectives.

TL;DR: HAC是一种分层音频编解码器，通过单一模型将瓶颈分解为声学、音素和词汇三个层次，利用知识蒸馏目标实现分层表示，并在多语言数据中验证了其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提出HAC的目的是为了在单一模型中统一表示语音的声学、音素和词汇层次，以更好地支持下游任务。

Method: HAC通过两个知识蒸馏目标（HuBERT用于音素结构，LaBSE用于词汇线索）实现分层表示。

Result: 实验表明HAC的分层瓶颈能够解耦表示，分别对应音素和词汇语义，且在自然度和重建质量上优于单层基线。

Conclusion: HAC作为一种统一的离散语音表示，有望在语音生成和理解任务中发挥重要作用。

Abstract: We propose Hierarchical Audio Codec (HAC), a unified neural speech codec that
factorizes its bottleneck into three linguistic levels-acoustic, phonetic, and
lexical-within a single model. HAC leverages two knowledge distillation
objectives: one from a pre-trained speech encoder (HuBERT) for phoneme-level
structure, and another from a text-based encoder (LaBSE) for lexical cues.
Experiments on English and multilingual data show that HAC's factorized
bottleneck yields disentangled token sets: one aligns with phonemes, while
another captures word-level semantics. Quantitative evaluations confirm that
HAC tokens preserve naturalness and provide interpretable linguistic
information, outperforming single-level baselines in both disentanglement and
reconstruction quality. These findings underscore HAC's potential as a unified
discrete speech representation, bridging acoustic detail and lexical meaning
for downstream speech generation and understanding tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为'Deformer'的可变形卷积替代传统CNN，用于语音识别，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CNN假设时间-频率模式是对称且固定的，而作者探讨了非对称核的潜力，发现自适应视图能更好地与注意力机制结合。

Method: 在Conformer架构中用可变形卷积（Deformer）替换深度CNN，分析其学习到的局部感受野和全局注意力图。

Result: Deformer在WSJ eval92数据集上相对WER提升了5.6%（无LM）和6.4%（有LM）。

Conclusion: 可变形卷积能更灵活地捕捉特征，提升语音识别性能，同时揭示了网络深度对特征信息的影响。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have improved speech recognition
performance greatly by exploiting localized time-frequency patterns. But these
patterns are assumed to appear in symmetric and rigid kernels by the
conventional CNN operation. It motivates the question: What about asymmetric
kernels? In this study, we illustrate adaptive views can discover local
features which couple better with attention than fixed views of the input. We
replace depthwise CNNs in the Conformer architecture with a deformable
counterpart, dubbed this "Deformer". By analyzing our best-performing model, we
visualize both local receptive fields and global attention maps learned by the
Deformer and show increased feature associations on the utterance level. The
statistical analysis of learned kernel offsets provides an insight into the
change of information in features with the network depth. Finally, replacing
only half of the layers in the encoder, the Deformer improves +5.6% relative
WER without a LM and +6.4% relative WER with a LM over the Conformer baseline
on the WSJ eval92 set.

Motivation: 传统修剪方法需多次修剪和重新训练，效率低下，本文旨在通过动态调整子网络结构，减少语言特定修剪的需求。

Method: 采用自适应掩码方法，动态调整子网络结构，避免固定子网络结构的过早决策。

Result: 方法在稀疏单语言模型上优于现有修剪方法，动态ASR路径能联合发现并训练更好的子网络。

Conclusion: 动态ASR路径通过自适应子网络初始化，减少了语言特定修剪的需求，提升了模型效率。

Abstract: Neural network pruning offers an effective method for compressing a
multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) model with minimal performance
loss. However, it entails several rounds of pruning and re-training needed to
be run for each language. In this work, we propose the use of an adaptive
masking approach in two scenarios for pruning a multilingual ASR model
efficiently, each resulting in sparse monolingual models or a sparse
multilingual model (named as Dynamic ASR Pathways). Our approach dynamically
adapts the sub-network, avoiding premature decisions about a fixed sub-network
structure. We show that our approach outperforms existing pruning methods when
targeting sparse monolingual models. Further, we illustrate that Dynamic ASR
Pathways jointly discovers and trains better sub-networks (pathways) of a
single multilingual model by adapting from different sub-network
initializations, thereby reducing the need for language-specific pruning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源自动语音识别（ASR）中数据不足的问题，提出一种简单有效的数据增强方法。

Method: MixRep插值神经网络隐藏表示的特征维度，结合时间轴正则化，应用于Conformer编码器和E2E LAS架构。

Result: 在WSJ和SWB数据集上，MixRep相比其他正则化方法表现更优，WER相对降低6.5%和6.7%。

Conclusion: MixRep是一种有效的低资源ASR数据增强方法，显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we present MixRep, a simple and effective data augmentation
strategy based on mixup for low-resource ASR. MixRep interpolates the feature
dimensions of hidden representations in the neural network that can be applied
to both the acoustic feature input and the output of each layer, which
generalizes the previous MixSpeech method. Further, we propose to combine the
mixup with a regularization along the time axis of the input, which is shown as
complementary. We apply MixRep to a Conformer encoder of an E2E LAS
architecture trained with a joint CTC loss. We experiment on the WSJ dataset
and subsets of the SWB dataset, covering reading and telephony conversational
speech. Experimental results show that MixRep consistently outperforms other
regularization methods for low-resource ASR. Compared to a strong SpecAugment
baseline, MixRep achieves a +6.5\% and a +6.7\% relative WER reduction on the
eval92 set and the Callhome part of the eval'2000 set.

Result: 实验表明，directional-SpeechLlama在语音识别和声源定位任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法有效捕捉文本线索与空间音频的关系，为多通道音频处理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that prompting large language models (LLM)
with audio encodings enables effective speech recognition capabilities.
However, the ability of Speech LLMs to comprehend and process multi-channel
audio with spatial cues remains a relatively uninvestigated area of research.
In this work, we present directional-SpeechLlama, a novel approach that
leverages the microphone array of smart glasses to achieve directional speech
recognition, source localization, and bystander cross-talk suppression. To
enhance the model's ability to understand directivity, we propose two key
techniques: serialized directional output training (S-DOT) and contrastive
direction data augmentation (CDDA). Experimental results show that our proposed
directional-SpeechLlama effectively captures the relationship between textual
cues and spatial audio, yielding strong performance in both speech recognition
and source localization tasks.

Motivation: 微地震记录了地下流体注入时的应力状态和渗透性变化，预测其演化对地热系统、CO2封存等应用至关重要。

Method: 采用Transformer模型，结合水力刺激历史和先前的MEQ观测数据，预测MEQ数量、地震矩及MEQ云的扩展范围。

Result: 在EGS Collab实验数据集上，模型在1秒和15秒预测时间范围内均取得高R²值（>0.98和>0.88），并提供不确定性估计。

Conclusion: 该模型能实时推断裂缝扩展和渗透性变化，展示了深度学习在地震风险评估和缓解策略中的潜力。

Abstract: Microearthquakes (MEQs) generated by subsurface fluid injection record the
evolving stress state and permeability of reservoirs. Forecasting their full
spatiotemporal evolution is therefore critical for applications such as
enhanced geothermal systems (EGS), CO$_2$ sequestration and other
geo-engineering applications. We present a transformer-based deep learning
model that ingests hydraulic stimulation history and prior MEQ observations to
forecast four key quantities: cumulative MEQ count, cumulative logarithmic
seismic moment, and the 50th- and 95th-percentile extents ($P_{50}, P_{95}$) of
the MEQ cloud. Applied to the EGS Collab Experiment 1 dataset, the model
achieves $R^2 >0.98$ for the 1-second forecast horizon and $R^2 >0.88$ for the
15-second forecast horizon across all targets, and supplies uncertainty
estimates through a learned standard deviation term. These accurate,
uncertainty-quantified forecasts enable real-time inference of fracture
propagation and permeability evolution, demonstrating the strong potential of
deep-learning approaches to improve seismic-risk assessment and guide
mitigation strategies in future fluid-injection operations.

Conclusion: 该方法为松散IMU传感器的姿态估计提供了新方向，未来研究潜力大。

Abstract: Motion capture using sparse inertial sensors has shown great promise due to
its portability and lack of occlusion issues compared to camera-based tracking.
Existing approaches typically assume that IMU sensors are tightly attached to
the human body. However, this assumption often does not hold in real-world
scenarios. In this paper, we present a new task of full-body human pose
estimation using sparse, loosely attached IMU sensors. To solve this task, we
simulate IMU recordings from an existing garment-aware human motion dataset. We
developed transformer-based diffusion models to synthesize loose IMU data and
estimate human poses based on this challenging loose IMU data. In addition, we
show that incorporating garment-related parameters while training the model on
simulated loose data effectively maintains expressiveness and enhances the
ability to capture variations introduced by looser or tighter garments.
Experiments show that our proposed diffusion methods trained on simulated and
synthetic data outperformed the state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and
qualitatively, opening up a promising direction for future research.

Conclusion: 提出的方法在数据稀缺场景下表现优异，具有实际应用潜力，数据集将公开。

Abstract: Face sketch synthesis is a technique aimed at converting face photos into
sketches. Existing face sketch synthesis research mainly relies on training
with numerous photo-sketch sample pairs from existing datasets. However, these
large-scale discriminative learning methods will have to face problems such as
data scarcity and high human labor costs. Once the training data becomes
scarce, their generative performance significantly degrades. In this paper, we
propose a one-shot face sketch synthesis method based on diffusion models. We
optimize text instructions on a diffusion model using face photo-sketch image
pairs. Then, the instructions derived through gradient-based optimization are
used for inference. To simulate real-world scenarios more accurately and
evaluate method effectiveness more comprehensively, we introduce a new
benchmark named One-shot Face Sketch Dataset (OS-Sketch). The benchmark
consists of 400 pairs of face photo-sketch images, including sketches with
different styles and photos with different backgrounds, ages, sexes,
expressions, illumination, etc. For a solid out-of-distribution evaluation, we
select only one pair of images for training at each time, with the rest used
for inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can
convert various photos into realistic and highly consistent sketches in a
one-shot context. Compared to other methods, our approach offers greater
convenience and broader applicability. The dataset will be available at:

Conclusion: Nabla-R2D3为3D生成模型提供了一种高效对齐方法，显著提升了生成质量。

Abstract: Generating high-quality and photorealistic 3D assets remains a longstanding
challenge in 3D vision and computer graphics. Although state-of-the-art
generative models, such as diffusion models, have made significant progress in
3D generation, they often fall short of human-designed content due to limited
ability to follow instructions, align with human preferences, or produce
realistic textures, geometries, and physical attributes. In this paper, we
introduce Nabla-R2D3, a highly effective and sample-efficient reinforcement
learning alignment framework for 3D-native diffusion models using 2D rewards.
Built upon the recently proposed Nabla-GFlowNet method, which matches the score
function to reward gradients in a principled manner for reward finetuning, our
Nabla-R2D3 enables effective adaptation of 3D diffusion models using only 2D
reward signals. Extensive experiments show that, unlike vanilla finetuning
baselines which either struggle to converge or suffer from reward hacking,
Nabla-R2D3 consistently achieves higher rewards and reduced prior forgetting
within a few finetuning steps.

Motivation: 现有降尺度方法主要依赖单一卫星数据，无法全面捕捉气象变量变化，导致结果偏离实际。

Method: MODS是一种条件扩散模型，融合多源卫星数据（GridSat、AMSU-A、HIRS、MHS）和地形数据（GEBCO），通过多源交叉注意力模块提取特征并融合到ERA5数据中。

Result: 实验表明，MODS在将ERA5数据降尺度至6.25 km分辨率时具有更高的保真度。

Conclusion: MODS通过多源数据融合，显著提升了气象变量降尺度的准确性和真实性。

Abstract: Accurate acquisition of high-resolution surface meteorological conditions is
critical for forecasting and simulating meteorological variables. Directly
applying spatial interpolation methods to derive meteorological values at
specific locations from low-resolution grid fields often yields results that
deviate significantly from the actual conditions. Existing downscaling methods
primarily rely on the coupling relationship between geostationary satellites
and ERA5 variables as a condition. However, using brightness temperature data
from geostationary satellites alone fails to comprehensively capture all the
changes in meteorological variables in ERA5 maps. To address this limitation,
we can use a wider range of satellite data to make more full use of its
inversion effects on various meteorological variables, thus producing more
realistic results across different meteorological variables. To further improve
the accuracy of downscaling meteorological variables at any location, we
propose the Multi-source Observation Down-Scaling Model (MODS). It is a
conditional diffusion model that fuses data from multiple geostationary
satellites GridSat, polar-orbiting satellites (AMSU-A, HIRS, and MHS), and
topographic data (GEBCO), as conditions, and is pre-trained on the ERA5
reanalysis dataset. During training, latent features from diverse conditional
inputs are extracted separately and fused into ERA5 maps via a multi-source
cross-attention module. By exploiting the inversion relationships between
reanalysis data and multi-source atmospheric variables, MODS generates
atmospheric states that align more closely with real-world conditions. During
sampling, MODS enhances downscaling consistency by incorporating low-resolution
ERA5 maps and station-level meteorological data as guidance. Experimental
results demonstrate that MODS achieves higher fidelity when downscaling ERA5
maps to a 6.25 km resolution.

Result: 新方法在多种测试场景中表现优于现有方法，并揭示了突触效能与延迟的相互作用。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在SNN中有效整合突触延迟，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Synaptic delays play a crucial role in biological neuronal networks, where
their modulation has been observed in mammalian learning processes. In the
realm of neuromorphic computing, although spiking neural networks (SNNs) aim to
emulate biology more closely than traditional artificial neural networks do,
synaptic delays are rarely incorporated into their simulation. We introduce a
novel learning rule for simultaneously learning synaptic connection strengths
and delays, by extending spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP), a Hebbian
method commonly used for learning synaptic weights. We validate our approach by
extending a widely-used SNN model for classification trained with unsupervised
learning. Then we demonstrate the effectiveness of our new method by comparing
it against another existing methods for co-learning synaptic weights and delays
as well as against STDP without synaptic delays. Results demonstrate that our
proposed method consistently achieves superior performance across a variety of
test scenarios. Furthermore, our experimental results yield insight into the
interplay between synaptic efficacy and delay.

Conclusion: DisProtEdit在保持性能的同时，显著提升了蛋白质编辑的模块化和可控性。

Abstract: We introduce DisProtEdit, a controllable protein editing framework that
leverages dual-channel natural language supervision to learn disentangled
representations of structural and functional properties. Unlike prior
approaches that rely on joint holistic embeddings, DisProtEdit explicitly
separates semantic factors, enabling modular and interpretable control. To
support this, we construct SwissProtDis, a large-scale multimodal dataset where
each protein sequence is paired with two textual descriptions, one for
structure and one for function, automatically decomposed using a large language
model. DisProtEdit aligns protein and text embeddings using alignment and
uniformity objectives, while a disentanglement loss promotes independence
between structural and functional semantics. At inference time, protein editing
is performed by modifying one or both text inputs and decoding from the updated
latent representation. Experiments on protein editing and representation
learning benchmarks demonstrate that DisProtEdit performs competitively with
existing methods while providing improved interpretability and controllability.
On a newly constructed multi-attribute editing benchmark, the model achieves a
both-hit success rate of up to 61.7%, highlighting its effectiveness in
coordinating simultaneous structural and functional edits.

common backdoor set, and establish, for time series with and without
consistency throughout time, conditions under which such a set exists. We also
provide algorithms of limited complexity to decide whether the problem is
identifiable or not.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保大规模工业无线网络中包级通信质量对URLLC至关重要，静态优先级的LDP算法在复杂场景下表现不足。

Method: 结合CNN和图着色技术，动态分配链路优先级，基于实时流量、传输机会和网络条件。

Result: 仿真结果显示，在三种网络配置下，SINR分别提升了113%、94%和49%。

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂URLLC场景中表现出色，提升了网络容量和调度效率。

Abstract: Ensuring packet-level communication quality is vital for ultra-reliable,
low-latency communications (URLLC) in large-scale industrial wireless networks.
We enhance the Local Deadline Partition (LDP) algorithm by introducing a
CNN-based dynamic priority prediction mechanism for improved interference
coordination in multi-cell, multi-channel networks. Unlike LDP's static
priorities, our approach uses a Convolutional Neural Network and graph coloring
to adaptively assign link priorities based on real-time traffic, transmission
opportunities, and network conditions. Assuming that first training phase is
performed offline, our approach introduced minimal overhead, while enabling
more efficient resource allocation, boosting network capacity, SINR, and
schedulability. Simulation results show SINR gains of up to 113\%, 94\%, and
49\% over LDP across three network configurations, highlighting its
effectiveness for complex URLLC scenarios.

Abstract: Ensuring packet-level communication quality is vital for ultra-reliable,
low-latency communications (URLLC) in large-scale industrial wireless networks.
We enhance the Local Deadline Partition (LDP) algorithm by introducing a Graph
Convolutional Network (GCN) integrated with a Deep Q-Network (DQN)
reinforcement learning framework for improved interference coordination in
multi-cell, multi-channel networks. Unlike LDP's static priorities, our
approach dynamically learns link priorities based on real-time traffic demand,
network topology, remaining transmission opportunities, and interference
patterns. The GCN captures spatial dependencies, while the DQN enables adaptive
scheduling decisions through reward-guided exploration. Simulation results show
that our GCN-DQN model achieves mean SINR improvements of 179.6\%, 197.4\%, and
175.2\% over LDP across three network configurations. Additionally, the GCN-DQN
model demonstrates mean SINR improvements of 31.5\%, 53.0\%, and 84.7\% over

underscore the effectiveness of our GCN-DQN model in addressing complex URLLC

### [282] [Efficient Serving of LLM Applications with Probabilistic Demand Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14851)
*Yifei Liu,Zuo Gan,Zhenghao Gan,Weiye Wang,Chen Chen,Yizhou Shan,Xusheng Chen,Zhenhua Han,Yifei Zhu,Shixuan Sun,Minyi Guo*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于概率需求图（PDGraph）的LLM应用服务系统Hermes，通过优化调度顺序和预热后端，显著提升了服务效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有系统将LLM应用的资源需求视为黑箱，导致端到端效率低下，无法有效处理动态需求。

Method: 利用PDGraph建模资源需求，采用Gittins策略优化调度顺序，并结合PDGraph模型预热后端。

Result: 实验表明，Hermes能将平均完成时间减少70%以上，P95完成时间减少80%以上。

Conclusion: Hermes通过精确建模和智能调度，显著提升了LLM应用的服务效率。

Abstract: Applications based on Large Language Models (LLMs) contains a series of tasks
to address real-world problems with boosted capability, which have dynamic
demand volumes on diverse backends. Existing serving systems treat the resource
demands of LLM applications as a blackbox, compromising end-to-end efficiency
due to improper queuing order and backend warm up latency. We find that the
resource demands of LLM applications can be modeled in a general and accurate
manner with Probabilistic Demand Graph (PDGraph). We then propose Hermes, which
leverages PDGraph for efficient serving of LLM applications. Confronting
probabilistic demand description, Hermes applies the Gittins policy to
determine the scheduling order that can minimize the average application
completion time. It also uses the PDGraph model to help prewarm cold backends
at proper moments. Experiments with diverse LLM applications confirm that
Hermes can effectively improve the application serving efficiency, reducing the
average completion time by over 70% and the P95 completion time by over 80%.

*Qizheng Zhang,Michael Wornow,Kunle Olukotun*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为“agentic plan caching”的新方法，通过提取、存储和重用结构化计划模板，显著降低LLM代理应用的成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM缓存技术（如上下文缓存和语义缓存）主要针对聊天机器人设计，无法满足依赖外部数据或环境上下文的代理应用需求。

Method: 从代理执行的规划阶段提取计划模板，通过关键词匹配和轻量模型适配新任务，实现成本优化。

Result: 在多个实际代理应用中，平均成本降低46.62%，同时保持性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLM代理服务提供了高效且互补的解决方案。

Abstract: LLM-based agentic applications have shown increasingly remarkable
capabilities in complex workflows but incur substantial costs due to extensive
planning and reasoning requirements. Existing LLM caching techniques (like
context caching and semantic caching), primarily designed for serving chatbots,
are insufficient for agentic applications where outputs depend on external data
or environmental contexts. We propose agentic plan caching, a novel approach
that extracts, stores, adapts, and reuses structured plan templates from
planning stages of agentic applications across semantically similar tasks to
reduce the cost of serving. Unlike traditional semantic caching, our system
extracts plan templates from completed agent executions at test-time, employs
keyword extraction to match new requests against cached plans, and utilizes
lightweight models to adapt these templates to task-specific plans with
contexts. Evaluation across multiple real-world agentic applications shows that
our system can reduce costs by 46.62% on average while maintaining performance,
offering a more efficient solution for serving LLM-based agents that
complements existing LLM serving infrastructures.

*Nikolay Blagoev,Oğuzhan Ersoy,Lydia Yiyu Chen*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 论文提出CheckFree和CheckFree+方法，通过加权平均相邻阶段或复制权重来高效恢复LLM训练中的节点故障，减少计算和存储开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 降低在分散和弱计算节点上训练LLM的成本，并解决节点故障导致的模型部分丢失问题。

Method: CheckFree通过加权平均相邻阶段恢复中间阶段故障；CheckFree+结合乱序流水线执行，通过复制权重恢复首尾阶段故障。

Result: 在低至中等故障率（5-10%）下，CheckFree和CheckFree+比传统方法快12%以上。

Conclusion: CheckFree系列方法高效且开销低，适用于大规模LLM训练。

Abstract: Training LLMs on decentralized and wimpy computation nodes, e.g., multiple
on-spot instances, lowers the training cost and enables model democratization.
The inevitable challenge here is the churn of nodes due to failures and the
operator's scheduling policies, leading to losing a stage - a part of the
model. The conventional approaches to recover from failures are to either use
checkpointing, where periodically a copy of the entire model is sent to an
additional storage, or redundant computation. These approaches yield
significant communication and/or computation overhead even in non-failure cases
and scale poorly in settings with large models. In this paper, we propose,
CheckFree, an efficient recovery method where a failing stage is substituted by
a weighted average of the closest neighboring stages. In contrast to the state
of the art, CheckFree requires no additional computation or storage. However,
because of the nature of averaging neighbouring stages, it can only recover
failures of intermediate stages. We further extend our method to CheckFree+
with out-of-order pipeline execution to tolerate crashes of the first and last
stages. Thanks to out-of-order pipelining, behaviour of those stages is
mimicked by their neighboring ones, which allows CheckFree+ to recover them by
simply copying the weights from the immediate neighbour. To be able to recover
the (de)embedding layers, CheckFree+ copies those layers to the neighboring
stages, which requires relatively small storage overhead. We extensively
evaluate our method on LLaMa models of model sizes from 124M to 1.5B with
varying failure frequencies. In the case of low and medium failure rates
(5-10%), CheckFree and CheckFree+ outperform both checkpointing and redundant
computation in terms of convergence in wall-clock time by over 12%. Both of our
proposals can be run via our code available at:
https://github.com/gensyn-ai/CheckFree.

Conclusion: AGI准备不仅是技术对齐问题，还需应对AI爆炸式发展带来的复杂局面。

Abstract: AI that can accelerate research could drive a century of technological
progress over just a few years. During such a period, new technological or
political developments will raise consequential and hard-to-reverse decisions,
in rapid succession. We call these developments grand challenges. These
challenges include new weapons of mass destruction, AI-enabled autocracies,
races to grab offworld resources, and digital beings worthy of moral
consideration, as well as opportunities to dramatically improve quality of life
and collective decision-making. We argue that these challenges cannot always be
delegated to future AI systems, and suggest things we can do today to
meaningfully improve our prospects. AGI preparedness is therefore not just
about ensuring that advanced AI systems are aligned: we should be preparing,
now, for the disorienting range of developments an intelligence explosion would
bring.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种定量框架，通过假设检验评估LLM模拟行为与真实人类行为在多选调查中的差异，发现流行语言模型在模拟争议性问题时与特定子群体（如种族、年龄、收入）不匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在社会科学研究中的应用增加，需评估其模拟人类行为的准确性。

Method: 使用假设检验的定量框架，评估LLM模拟与真实人类行为在多选调查中的差异。

Result: 发现流行语言模型在模拟争议性问题时与特定子群体不匹配。

Conclusion: 需改进LLM在社会科学研究中的应用方法，避免简单模拟人类行为。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly appear in social science
research (e.g., economics and marketing), it becomes crucial to assess how well
these models replicate human behavior. In this work, using hypothesis testing,
we present a quantitative framework to assess the misalignment between
LLM-simulated and actual human behaviors in multiple-choice survey settings.
This framework allows us to determine in a principled way whether a specific
language model can effectively simulate human opinions, decision-making, and
general behaviors represented through multiple-choice options. We applied this
framework to a popular language model for simulating people's opinions in
various public surveys and found that this model is ill-suited for simulating
the tested sub-populations (e.g., across different races, ages, and incomes)
for contentious questions. This raises questions about the alignment of this
language model with the tested populations, highlighting the need for new
practices in using LLMs for social science studies beyond naive simulations of
human subjects.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 论文提出Transit for All (TFA)框架，通过预测自行车共享需求、改进公共交通可达性评估及优化站点布局，促进纽约市低收入和少数族裔社区的交通公平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高密度城市中低收入和少数族裔社区公共交通可达性不足的问题，自行车共享系统（BSS）可作为补充，但传统方法难以预测新站点需求。

Method: TFA框架包含三部分：基于多模态地理数据的自行车共享需求预测、结合预测结果的加权公共交通可达性评估（wPTAL）、优化站点布局策略。

Result: 在纽约市的案例中，TFA显著减少了经济与人口因素导致的交通可达性差异。

Conclusion: TFA为城市规划者提供了促进交通公平、提升服务不足社区生活质量的实用工具。

Abstract: Ensuring equitable public transit access remains challenging, particularly in
densely populated cities like New York City (NYC), where low-income and
minority communities often face limited transit accessibility. Bike-sharing
systems (BSS) can bridge these equity gaps by providing affordable first- and
last-mile connections. However, strategically expanding BSS into underserved
neighborhoods is difficult due to uncertain bike-sharing demand at newly
planned ("cold-start") station locations and limitations in traditional
accessibility metrics that may overlook realistic bike usage potential. We
introduce Transit for All (TFA), a spatial computing framework designed to
guide the equitable expansion of BSS through three components: (1)
spatially-informed bike-sharing demand prediction at cold-start stations using
region representation learning that integrates multimodal geospatial data, (2)
comprehensive transit accessibility assessment leveraging our novel weighted
Public Transport Accessibility Level (wPTAL) by combining predicted
bike-sharing demand with conventional transit accessibility metrics, and (3)
strategic recommendations for new bike station placements that consider
potential ridership and equity enhancement. Using NYC as a case study, we
identify transit accessibility gaps that disproportionately impact low-income
and minority communities in historically underserved neighborhoods. Our results
show that strategically placing new stations guided by wPTAL notably reduces
disparities in transit access related to economic and demographic factors. From
our study, we demonstrate that TFA provides practical guidance for urban
planners to promote equitable transit and enhance the quality of life in
underserved urban communities.

TL;DR: FORTRESS是一个专家设计的对抗性提示评估框架，用于测试大型语言模型在国家安全和公共安全领域的防护能力，揭示了模型在潜在风险和过度拒绝之间的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基准测试无法客观评估大型语言模型在国家安全和公共安全领域的防护能力，因此需要一种更稳健的评估方法。

Method: 引入FORTRESS，包含500个专家设计的对抗性提示和评分标准，覆盖3个领域（CBRNE、政治暴力与恐怖主义、犯罪与金融非法活动），并测试模型的过度拒绝行为。

Result: 不同模型在潜在风险和过度拒绝之间表现出不同权衡，例如Claude-3.5-Sonnet风险低但过度拒绝高，Gemini 2.5 Pro则相反。

Conclusion: FORTRESS为政策制定者和研究者提供了清晰的模型风险评估工具，并公开了数据集。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) introduces dual-use
capabilities that could both threaten and bolster national security and public
safety (NSPS). Models implement safeguards to protect against potential misuse
relevant to NSPS and allow for benign users to receive helpful information.
However, current benchmarks often fail to test safeguard robustness to
potential NSPS risks in an objective, robust way. We introduce FORTRESS: 500
expert-crafted adversarial prompts with instance-based rubrics of 4-7 binary
questions for automated evaluation across 3 domains (unclassified information
only): Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and Explosive (CBRNE),
Political Violence & Terrorism, and Criminal & Financial Illicit Activities,
with 10 total subcategories across these domains. Each prompt-rubric pair has a
corresponding benign version to test for model over-refusals. This evaluation
of frontier LLMs' safeguard robustness reveals varying trade-offs between
potential risks and model usefulness: Claude-3.5-Sonnet demonstrates a low
average risk score (ARS) (14.09 out of 100) but the highest over-refusal score
(ORS) (21.8 out of 100), while Gemini 2.5 Pro shows low over-refusal (1.4) but
a high average potential risk (66.29). Deepseek-R1 has the highest ARS at
78.05, but the lowest ORS at only 0.06. Models such as o1 display a more even
trade-off between potential risks and over-refusals (with an ARS of 21.69 and
ORS of 5.2). To provide policymakers and researchers with a clear understanding
of models' potential risks, we publicly release FORTRESS at
https://huggingface.co/datasets/ScaleAI/fortress_public. We also maintain a
private set for evaluation.

Motivation: 大型语言模型预训练依赖难以管理的大规模文本数据，现有方法依赖数据记忆，而模型提供者试图限制记忆。

Method: 使用基于梯度的优化提示调优，使模型学习训练数据中不存在的秘密序列。

Result: 实验表明，仅需极少量（<0.005%）的投毒标记即可让模型学习秘密，并以极高置信度（p < 10^-55）检测到。

Conclusion: 该方法在不影响模型性能的情况下，实现了数据集保护和追踪，且秘密序列从未出现在训练数据中。

Abstract: The pre-training of large language models (LLMs) relies on massive text
datasets sourced from diverse and difficult-to-curate origins. Although
membership inference attacks and hidden canaries have been explored to trace
data usage, such methods rely on memorization of training data, which LM
providers try to limit. In this work, we demonstrate that indirect data
poisoning (where the targeted behavior is absent from training data) is not
only feasible but also allow to effectively protect a dataset and trace its
use. Using gradient-based optimization prompt-tuning, we make a model learn
arbitrary secret sequences: secret responses to secret prompts that are absent
from the training corpus. We validate our approach on language models
pre-trained from scratch and show that less than 0.005% of poisoned tokens are
sufficient to covertly make a LM learn a secret and detect it with extremely
high confidence ($p < 10^{-55}$) with a theoretically certifiable scheme.
Crucially, this occurs without performance degradation (on LM benchmarks) and
despite secrets never appearing in the training set.

Motivation: 现有基于矩阵机制的最优算法需要预先知道输入规模n，而实际应用中n可能未知，导致隐私保证和性能受限。

Method: 引入基于对数扰动的新矩阵分解方法，利用函数1/√(1-z)的变体，设计了具有平滑误差的算法。

Result: 算法在隐私估计前t个数据点总和时，方差为O(log²⁺²ᵅ(t))，空间复杂度O(t)，每轮时间O(log t)。

Conclusion: 新算法在无界设置下表现优异，性能接近已知n的最优算法，且实际方差较小。

Abstract: We study the problem of differentially private continual counting in the
unbounded setting where the input size $n$ is not known in advance. Current
state-of-the-art algorithms based on optimal instantiations of the matrix
mechanism cannot be directly applied here because their privacy guarantees only
hold when key parameters are tuned to $n$. Using the common `doubling trick'
avoids knowledge of $n$ but leads to suboptimal and non-smooth error. We solve
this problem by introducing novel matrix factorizations based on logarithmic
perturbations of the function $\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-z}}$ studied in prior works,
which may be of independent interest. The resulting algorithm has smooth error,
and for any $\alpha > 0$ and $t\leq n$ it is able to privately estimate the sum
of the first $t$ data points with $O(\log^{2+2\alpha}(t))$ variance. It
requires $O(t)$ space and amortized $O(\log t)$ time per round, compared to
$O(\log(n)\log(t))$ variance, $O(n)$ space and $O(n \log n)$ pre-processing
time for the nearly-optimal bounded-input algorithm of Henzinger et al. (SODA
2023). Empirically, we find that our algorithm's performance is also comparable
to theirs in absolute terms: our variance is less than $1.5\times$ theirs for
$t$ as large as $2^{24}$.

Conclusion: 强调在预市场阶段解决AI/ML医疗设备网络安全问题的紧迫性，以确保患者安全。

Abstract: The integration of AI/ML into medical devices is rapidly transforming
healthcare by enhancing diagnostic and treatment facilities. However, this
advancement also introduces serious cybersecurity risks due to the use of
complex and often opaque models, extensive interconnectivity, interoperability
with third-party peripheral devices, Internet connectivity, and vulnerabilities
in the underlying technologies. These factors contribute to a broad attack
surface and make threat prevention, detection, and mitigation challenging.
Given the highly safety-critical nature of these devices, a cyberattack on
these devices can cause the ML models to mispredict, thereby posing significant
safety risks to patients. Therefore, ensuring the security of these devices
from the time of design is essential. This paper underscores the urgency of
addressing the cybersecurity challenges in ML-enabled medical devices at the
pre-market phase. We begin by analyzing publicly available data on device
recalls and adverse events, and known vulnerabilities, to understand the threat
landscape of AI/ML-enabled medical devices and their repercussions on patient
safety. Building on this analysis, we introduce a suite of tools and techniques
designed by us to assist security analysts in conducting comprehensive
premarket risk assessments. Our work aims to empower manufacturers to embed
cybersecurity as a core design principle in AI/ML-enabled medical devices,
thereby making them safe for patients.

Motivation: 5G-NR无线网络中干扰攻击普遍，影响信号质量，需要一种高效的检测方法。

Method: 使用卷积自编码器（CAE）检测干扰，并通过CWGAN-GP平衡数据集，对比了CDAE和CSAE基准模型。

Result: CAE在干扰检测中表现出色，平均精度97.33%，召回率91.33%，F1分数94.08%，准确率94.35%。

Conclusion: CAE在复杂数据环境下具有鲁棒性，优于其他基准模型，适用于5G-NR网络的干扰检测。

Abstract: In the ever-expanding domain of 5G-NR wireless cellular networks,
over-the-air jamming attacks are prevalent as security attacks, compromising
the quality of the received signal. We simulate a jamming environment by
incorporating additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) into the real-world In-phase
and Quadrature (I/Q) OFDM datasets. A Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) is
exploited to implement a jamming detection over various characteristics such as
heterogenous I/Q datasets; extracting relevant information on Synchronization
Signal Blocks (SSBs), and fewer SSB observations with notable class imbalance.
Given the characteristics of datasets, balanced datasets are acquired by
employing a Conv1D conditional Wasserstein Generative Adversarial
Network-Gradient Penalty(CWGAN-GP) on both majority and minority SSB
observations. Additionally, we compare the performance and detection ability of
the proposed CAE model on augmented datasets with benchmark models:
Convolutional Denoising Autoencoder (CDAE) and Convolutional Sparse Autoencoder
(CSAE). Despite the complexity of data heterogeneity involved across all
datasets, CAE depicts the robustness in detection performance of jammed signal
by achieving average values of 97.33% precision, 91.33% recall, 94.08%
F1-score, and 94.35% accuracy over CDAE and CSAE.

### [296] [deepSURF: Detecting Memory Safety Vulnerabilities in Rust Through Fuzzing LLM-Augmented Harnesses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15648)
*Georgios Androutsopoulos,Antonio Bianchi*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: deepSURF结合静态分析和LLM引导的模糊测试生成，有效检测Rust库中的内存安全漏洞，特别是在不安全代码中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具在检测Rust内存漏洞时能力有限，无法充分处理Rust特有类型或依赖人工干预。

Method: deepSURF通过替换泛型为自定义类型并生成特质实现，结合LLM动态增强模糊测试用例。

Result: 在27个真实Rust库中，deepSURF重新发现20个已知漏洞并发现6个新漏洞。

Conclusion: deepSURF在检测Rust内存安全漏洞方面显著优于现有工具。

Abstract: Although Rust ensures memory safety by default, it also permits the use of
unsafe code, which can introduce memory safety vulnerabilities if misused.
Unfortunately, existing tools for detecting memory bugs in Rust typically
exhibit limited detection capabilities, inadequately handle Rust-specific
types, or rely heavily on manual intervention.
  To address these limitations, we present deepSURF, a tool that integrates
static analysis with Large Language Model (LLM)-guided fuzzing harness
generation to effectively identify memory safety vulnerabilities in Rust
libraries, specifically targeting unsafe code. deepSURF introduces a novel
approach for handling generics by substituting them with custom types and
generating tailored implementations for the required traits, enabling the
fuzzer to simulate user-defined behaviors within the fuzzed library.
Additionally, deepSURF employs LLMs to augment fuzzing harnesses dynamically,
facilitating exploration of complex API interactions and significantly
increasing the likelihood of exposing memory safety vulnerabilities. We
evaluated deepSURF on 27 real-world Rust crates, successfully rediscovering 20
known memory safety bugs and uncovering 6 previously unknown vulnerabilities,
demonstrating clear improvements over state-of-the-art tools.

*Yuxuan Xia,Ángel F. García-Fernández,Johan Karlsson,Yu Ge,Lennart Svensson,Ting Yuan*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种广义的轨迹最优子模式分配（GOSPA）度量方法，用于评估提供轨迹估计的多目标跟踪算法，并考虑了轨迹级不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未充分处理轨迹估计中的不确定性，因此需要一种能够同时考虑存在性和状态估计不确定性的度量方法。

Method: 基于概率GOSPA度量，将其扩展为多维分配问题，并通过线性规划松弛实现多项式时间计算。

Result: 新度量保留了TGOSPA的可解释性，分解后得到直观的成本项，如定位误差、存在概率不匹配误差等。仿真研究验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的度量方法能够有效评估多目标跟踪算法，并提供了直观的误差分解。

Abstract: This paper presents a generalization of the trajectory general optimal
sub-pattern assignment (GOSPA) metric for evaluating multi-object tracking
algorithms that provide trajectory estimates with track-level uncertainties.
This metric builds on the recently introduced probabilistic GOSPA metric to
account for both the existence and state estimation uncertainties of individual
object states. Similar to trajectory GOSPA (TGOSPA), it can be formulated as a
multidimensional assignment problem, and its linear programming
relaxation--also a valid metric--is computable in polynomial time.
Additionally, this metric retains the interpretability of TGOSPA, and we show
that its decomposition yields intuitive costs terms associated to expected
localization error and existence probability mismatch error for properly
detected objects, expected missed and false detection error, and track switch
error. The effectiveness of the proposed metric is demonstrated through a
simulation study.

TL;DR: 论文研究了Transformer中自注意力机制的内在（注意力头内）和外在（注意力头间）结构，证明了自注意力机制对softmax激活的不变性，并提出了一种层次化组织方法，用于网络结构的分析和应用。


<details>

Motivation: 探索自注意力机制的结构特性，以提升其可解释性和实用性，如模型剪枝和架构比较。

Method: 结合理论分析（如拟微分计算）和计算方法，构建层次化分区树，分析网络3-张量的结构。

Result: 证明了自注意力机制对softmax的不变性，展示了层次化组织在可视化和网络稀疏性分析中的应用。

Conclusion: 研究为可解释性分析和网络应用（如模型剪枝）提供了理论基础和方法支持。

Abstract: We examine the intrinsic (within the attention head) and extrinsic (amongst
the attention heads) structure of the self-attention mechanism in transformers.
Theoretical evidence for invariance of the self-attention mechanism to softmax
activation is obtained by appealing to paradifferential calculus, (and is
supported by computational examples), which relies on the intrinsic
organization of the attention heads. Furthermore, we use an existing
methodology for hierarchical organization of tensors to examine network
structure by constructing hierarchal partition trees with respect to the query,
key, and head axes of network 3-tensors. Such an organization is consequential
since it allows one to profitably execute common signal processing tasks on a
geometry where the organized network 3-tensors exhibit regularity. We exemplify
this qualitatively, by visualizing the hierarchical organization of the tree
comprised of attention heads and the diffusion map embeddings, and
quantitatively by investigating network sparsity with the expansion
coefficients of individual attention heads and the entire network with respect
to the bi and tri-haar bases (respectively) on the space of queries, keys, and
heads of the network. To showcase the utility of our theoretical and
methodological findings, we provide computational examples using vision and
language transformers. The ramifications of these findings are two-fold: (1) a
subsequent step in interpretability analysis is theoretically admitted, and can
be exploited empirically for downstream interpretability tasks (2) one can use
the network 3-tensor organization for empirical network applications such as
model pruning (by virtue of network sparsity) and network architecture
comparison.

Motivation: 解决仅通过矩阵-向量乘积估计矩阵谱范数的问题，尤其是在谱快速衰减的矩阵（如深度学习和逆问题中的矩阵）中表现更优。

Method: 提出Counterbalance估计器，通过矩阵-向量乘积计算谱范数的上界，并推导其低估概率的保证。

Result: 在合成和实际数据中，该方法比传统方法（如幂方法）提供更紧的上界。

Conclusion: Counterbalance估计器在谱快速衰减的矩阵中表现优异，适用于深度学习和逆问题等领域。

Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating the spectral norm of a matrix using
only matrix-vector products. We propose a new Counterbalance estimator that
provides upper bounds on the norm and derive probabilistic guarantees on its
underestimation. Compared to standard approaches such as the power method, the
proposed estimator produces significantly tighter upper bounds in both
synthetic and real-world settings. Our method is especially effective for
matrices with fast-decaying spectra, such as those arising in deep learning and
inverse problems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）代理的自动超参数调优方法，用于改进WS-PSO-CM算法在无人机通信中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前WS-PSO-CM算法的超参数调优方法依赖启发式，自动化程度低且性能不佳。

Method: 设计了一个LLM代理，通过迭代框架和模型上下文协议（MCP）自动调优超参数。

Result: 实验表明，LLM代理生成的超参数在最小和速率上显著优于人工启发式和随机生成方法。

Conclusion: LLM代理结合PSO知识可有效找到高性能超参数。

Abstract: Hyper-parameters are essential and critical for the performance of
communication algorithms. However, current hyper-parameters tuning methods for
warm-start particles swarm optimization with cross and mutation (WS-PSO-CM)
algortihm for radio map-enabled unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) trajectory and
communication are primarily heuristic-based, exhibiting low levels of
automation and unsatisfactory performance. In this paper, we design an large
language model (LLM) agent for automatic hyper-parameters-tuning, where an
iterative framework and model context protocol (MCP) are applied. In
particular, the LLM agent is first setup via a profile, which specifies the
mission, background, and output format. Then, the LLM agent is driven by the
prompt requirement, and iteratively invokes WS-PSO-CM algorithm for
exploration. Finally, the LLM agent autonomously terminates the loop and
returns a set of hyper-parameters. Our experiment results show that the minimal
sum-rate achieved by hyper-parameters generated via our LLM agent is
significantly higher than those by both human heuristics and random generation
methods. This indicates that an LLM agent with PSO knowledge and WS-PSO-CM
algorithm background is useful in finding high-performance hyper-parameters.

Result: ICL是一种基于上下文信息的自适应方法，能够高效实现接收器的实时适应。

Conclusion: ICL为无线接收器的自适应提供了一种理论严谨且高效的方法，适用于动态信道环境。

Abstract: In recent years, deep learning has facilitated the creation of wireless
receivers capable of functioning effectively in conditions that challenge
traditional model-based designs. Leveraging programmable hardware
architectures, deep learning-based receivers offer the potential to dynamically
adapt to varying channel environments. However, current adaptation strategies,
including joint training, hypernetwork-based methods, and meta-learning, either
demonstrate limited flexibility or necessitate explicit optimization through
gradient descent. This paper presents gradient-free adaptation techniques
rooted in the emerging paradigm of in-context learning (ICL). We review
architectural frameworks for ICL based on Transformer models and structured
state-space models (SSMs), alongside theoretical insights into how sequence
models effectively learn adaptation from contextual information. Further, we
explore the application of ICL to cell-free massive MIMO networks, providing
both theoretical analyses and empirical evidence. Our findings indicate that
ICL represents a principled and efficient approach to real-time receiver
adaptation using pilot signals and auxiliary contextual information-without
requiring online retraining.

Conclusion: DrRL通过结合SL和CCL的优势，有效解决了它们的局限性，提升了推荐系统的性能。

Abstract: Loss functions play a pivotal role in optimizing recommendation models. Among
various loss functions, Softmax Loss (SL) and Cosine Contrastive Loss (CCL) are
particularly effective. Their theoretical connections and differences warrant
in-depth exploration. This work conducts comprehensive analyses of these
losses, yielding significant insights: 1) Common strengths -- both can be
viewed as augmentations of traditional losses with Distributional Robust
Optimization (DRO), enhancing robustness to distributional shifts; 2)
Respective limitations -- stemming from their use of different distribution
distance metrics in DRO optimization, SL exhibits high sensitivity to false
negative instances, whereas CCL suffers from low data utilization. To address
these limitations, this work proposes a new loss function, DrRL, which
generalizes SL and CCL by leveraging R\'enyi-divergence in DRO optimization.
DrRL incorporates the advantageous structures of both SL and CCL, and can be
demonstrated to effectively mitigate their limitations. Extensive experiments
have been conducted to validate the superiority of DrRL on both recommendation
accuracy and robustness.

Motivation: 解决分子动力学模拟中精确力预测计算成本高的问题。

Method: 使用GemNet-T模型，比较直接训练和预训练+微调两种策略。

Result: 两种策略均实现低力误差，但预训练模型显著提高模拟稳定性。

Conclusion: 预训练在大规模数据集上能提升模拟稳定性，力误差不足以完全衡量稳定性。

Abstract: Machine-learning force fields (MLFFs) have emerged as a promising solution
for speeding up ab initio molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, where accurate
force predictions are critical but often computationally expensive. In this
work, we employ GemNet-T, a graph neural network model, as an MLFF and
investigate two training strategies: (1) direct training on MD17 (10K samples)
without pre-training, and (2) pre-training on the large-scale OC20 dataset
followed by fine-tuning on MD17 (10K). While both approaches achieve low force
mean absolute errors (MAEs), reaching 5 meV/A per atom, we find that lower
force errors do not necessarily guarantee stable MD simulations. Notably, the
pre-trained GemNet-T model yields significantly improved simulation stability,
sustaining trajectories up to three times longer than the model trained from
scratch. These findings underscore the value of pre-training on large, diverse
datasets to capture complex molecular interactions and highlight that force MAE
alone is not always a sufficient metric of MD simulation stability.

Conclusion: 结论指出，融入文化多样性的声音设计能创造更丰富的听觉体验，并促进领域的包容性。

Abstract: The Audio Mostly (AM) conference has long been a platform for exploring the
intersection of sound, technology, and culture. Despite growing interest in
sonic cultures, discussions on the role of cultural diversity in sound design
and sonification remain limited. This paper investigates the implicit biases
and gaps within the discourse on music and sound aesthetics, challenging the
notion of music as a 'universal language'. Through a historical and
cross-cultural analysis of musicology and ethnomusicology, the profound
influence of cultural context on auditory perception and aesthetic appraisal is
highlighted. By drawing parallels between historical music practices and
contemporary sound design, the paper advocates for a more inclusive approach
that recognizes the diversity of sonic traditions. Using music as a case study,
we underscore broader implications for sound design and sonification,
emphasizing the need to integrate cultural perspectives into auditory design
practices. A reevaluation of existing frameworks in sound design and
sonification is proposed, emphasizing the necessity of culturally informed
practices that resonate with global audiences. Ultimately, embracing cultural
diversity in sound design is suggested to lead to richer, more meaningful
auditory experiences and to foster greater inclusivity within the field.

Result: 方法生成的板设计在减少结构振动方面优于随机搜索、基于准则的设计启发式和遗传优化。

Abstract: Structural vibrations are a source of unwanted noise in engineering systems
like cars, trains or airplanes. Minimizing these vibrations is crucial for
improving passenger comfort. This work presents a novel design optimization
approach based on guided flow matching for reducing vibrations by placing
beadings (indentations) in plate-like structures. Our method integrates a
generative flow matching model and a surrogate model trained to predict
structural vibrations. During the generation process, the flow matching model
pushes towards manufacturability while the surrogate model pushes to
low-vibration solutions. The flow matching model and its training data
implicitly define the design space, enabling a broader exploration of potential
solutions as no optimization of manually-defined design parameters is required.
We apply our method to a range of differentiable optimization objectives,
including direct optimization of specific eigenfrequencies through careful
construction of the objective function. Results demonstrate that our method
generates diverse and manufacturable plate designs with reduced structural
vibrations compared to designs from random search, a criterion-based design
heuristic and genetic optimization. The code and data are available from

Result: 在三个真实数据集上，CI4GI显著优于现有模型。

Conclusion: CI4GI有效建模了用户兴趣的双层协同演化，提升了群体推荐的准确性。

Abstract: With the popularity of social media, an increasing number of users are
joining group activities on online social platforms. This elicits the
requirement of group identification (GI), which is to recommend groups to
users. We reveal that users are influenced by both group-level and item-level
interests, and these dual-level interests have a collaborative evolution
relationship: joining a group expands the user's item interests, further
prompting the user to join new groups. Ultimately, the two interests tend to
align dynamically. However, existing GI methods fail to fully model this
collaborative evolution relationship, ignoring the enhancement of group-level
interests on item-level interests, and suffering from false-negative samples
when aligning cross-level interests. In order to fully model the collaborative
evolution relationship between dual-level user interests, we propose CI4GI, a
Collaborative Interest-aware model for Group Identification. Specifically, we
design an interest enhancement strategy that identifies additional interests of
users from the items interacted with by the groups they have joined as a
supplement to item-level interests. In addition, we adopt the distance between
interest distributions of two users to optimize the identification of negative
samples for a user, mitigating the interference of false-negative samples
during cross-level interests alignment. The results of experiments on three
real-world datasets demonstrate that CI4GI significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: How can we detect when global events fundamentally reshape public discourse?
This study introduces a topological framework for identifying structural change
in media narratives using persistent homology. Drawing on international news
articles surrounding major events - including the Russian invasion of Ukraine
(Feb 2022), the murder of George Floyd (May 2020), the U.S. Capitol
insurrection (Jan 2021), and the Hamas-led invasion of Israel (Oct 2023) - we
construct daily co-occurrence graphs of noun phrases to trace evolving
discourse. Each graph is embedded and transformed into a persistence diagram
via a Vietoris-Rips filtration. We then compute Wasserstein distances and
persistence entropies across homological dimensions to capture semantic
disruption and narrative volatility over time. Our results show that major
geopolitical and social events align with sharp spikes in both H0 (connected
components) and H1 (loops), indicating sudden reorganization in narrative
structure and coherence. Cross-correlation analyses reveal a typical lag
pattern in which changes to component-level structure (H0) precede higher-order
motif shifts (H1), suggesting a bottom-up cascade of semantic change. An
exception occurs during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, where H1 entropy leads
H0, possibly reflecting top-down narrative framing before local discourse
adjusts. Persistence entropy further distinguishes tightly focused from diffuse
narrative regimes. These findings demonstrate that persistent homology offers a
mathematically principled, unsupervised method for detecting inflection points
and directional shifts in public attention - without requiring prior knowledge
of specific events. This topological approach advances computational social
science by enabling real-time detection of semantic restructuring during
crises, protests, and information shocks.

Conclusion: 模型具有扩展性，适用于早期预警系统和人道主义响应规划。

Abstract: Forecasting violent conflict at high spatial and temporal resolution remains
a central challenge for both researchers and policymakers. This study presents
a novel neural network architecture for forecasting three distinct types of
violence -- state-based, non-state, and one-sided -- at the subnational
(priogrid-month) level, up to 36 months in advance. The model jointly performs
classification and regression tasks, producing both probabilistic estimates and
expected magnitudes of future events. It achieves state-of-the-art performance
across all tasks and generates approximate predictive posterior distributions
to quantify forecast uncertainty.
  The architecture is built on a Monte Carlo Dropout Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) U-Net, integrating convolutional layers to capture spatial dependencies
with recurrent structures to model temporal dynamics. Unlike many existing
approaches, it requires no manual feature engineering and relies solely on
historical conflict data. This design enables the model to autonomously learn
complex spatiotemporal patterns underlying violent conflict.
  Beyond achieving state-of-the-art predictive performance, the model is also
highly extensible: it can readily integrate additional data sources and jointly
forecast auxiliary variables. These capabilities make it a promising tool for
early warning systems, humanitarian response planning, and evidence-based
peacebuilding initiatives.

TL;DR: 论文提出CUE模型，将解释属性与认知子过程（可读性、可理解性、可解释性）关联，并通过实验验证了可访问性优化的局限性，支持自适应XAI界面的需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习系统在关键决策中的作用增强，人类可理解的解释需求日益突出。当前XAI评估常忽视认知可访问性，尤其是对视觉障碍用户的影响。

Method: 提出CUE模型，通过实验测试不同热图色彩方案（BWR、Cividis、Coolwarm）对用户任务表现和信心的影响。

Result: 实验发现任务表现相似，但视觉障碍用户的信心和努力程度较低，且可访问性优化的色彩方案（如Cividis）未缓解甚至加剧了差距。

Conclusion: 结果挑战了感知优化的假设，支持自适应XAI界面的需求，并验证了CUE模型的有效性。

Abstract: As machine learning systems increasingly inform critical decisions, the need
for human-understandable explanations grows. Current evaluations of Explainable
AI (XAI) often prioritize technical fidelity over cognitive accessibility which
critically affects users, in particular those with visual impairments. We
propose CUE, a model for Cognitive Understanding of Explanations, linking
explanation properties to cognitive sub-processes: legibility (perception),
readability (comprehension), and interpretability (interpretation). In a study
(N=455) testing heatmaps with varying colormaps (BWR, Cividis, Coolwarm), we
found comparable task performance but lower confidence/effort for visually
impaired users. Unlike expected, these gaps were not mitigated and sometimes
worsened by accessibility-focused color maps like Cividis. These results
challenge assumptions about perceptual optimization and support the need for
adaptive XAI interfaces. They also validate CUE by demonstrating that altering
explanation legibility affects understandability. We contribute: (1) a
formalized cognitive model for explanation understanding, (2) an integrated
definition of human-centered explanation properties, and (3) empirical evidence
motivating accessible, user-tailored XAI.

TL;DR: WebXAII是一个开源框架，旨在简化人类与可解释人工智能（XAI）系统交互的研究，通过标准化实验协议提高可重用性和可重复性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: XAI领域快速发展，但研究者通常使用临时接口进行实验，缺乏共享和可重复性，WebXAII旨在解决这一问题。

Result: 成功复现了文献中的先进研究协议，验证了WebXAII的有效性。

Conclusion: WebXAII为XAI交互研究提供了灵活且易于使用的工具，促进了实验的可重复性和资源共享。

Abstract: This article introduces WebXAII, an open-source web framework designed to
facilitate research on human interaction with eXplainable Artificial
Intelligence (XAI) systems. The field of XAI is rapidly expanding, driven by
the growing societal implications of the widespread adoption of AI (and in
particular machine learning) across diverse applications. Researchers who study
the interaction between humans and XAI techniques typically develop ad hoc
interfaces in order to conduct their studies. These interfaces are usually not
shared alongside the results of the studies, which limits their reusability and
the reproducibility of experiments. In response, we design and implement
WebXAII, a web-based platform that can embody full experimental protocols,
meaning that it can present all aspects of the experiment to human participants
and record their responses. The experimental protocols are translated into a
composite architecture of generic views and modules, which offers a lot of
flexibility. The architecture is defined in a structured configuration file, so
that protocols can be implemented with minimal programming skills. We
demonstrate that WebXAII can effectively embody relevant protocols, by
reproducing the protocol of a state-of-the-art study of the literature. The
framework is available at https://github.com/PAJEAN/WebXAII.

Motivation: 探讨AI生成的性别和年龄分布数据对公众的实用性和可信度。

Method: 使用CLIP模型分析视觉数据，设计可视化工具，并通过用户研究评估效果。

Result: 用户认为工具总体有用，但对AI模型的信任度中等偏低，希望增加更多人口统计类别和上下文信息。

Conclusion: 工具在展示角色分布方面有效，但需改进以提升用户信任和实用性。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI has enabled automated analysis of complex media content
at scale and generate actionable insights regarding character representation
along such dimensions as gender and age. Past work focused on quantifying
representation from audio/video/text using various ML models, but without
having the audience in the loop. We ask, even if character distribution along
demographic dimensions are available, how useful are they to the general
public? Do they actually trust the numbers generated by AI models? Our work
addresses these questions through a user study, while proposing a new AI-based
character representation and visualization tool. Our tool based on the
Contrastive Language Image Pretraining (CLIP) foundation model to analyze
visual screen data to quantify character representation across dimensions of
age and gender. We also designed effective visualizations suitable for
presenting such analytics to lay audience. Next, we conducted a user study to
seek empirical evidence on the usefulness and trustworthiness of the
AI-generated results for carefully chosen movies presented in the form of our
visualizations. We note that participants were able to understand the analytics
from our visualization, and deemed the tool `overall useful'. Participants also
indicated a need for more detailed visualizations to include more demographic
categories and contextual information of the characters. Participants' trust in
AI-based gender and age models is seen to be moderate to low, although they
were not against the use of AI in this context. Our tool including code,
benchmarking, and data from the user study can be found here:

Conclusion: 论文为未来设计工具包奠定概念基础，提出了混合工作环境中多模态、自适应和可信机器人协作的研究议程。

Abstract: As robots enter collaborative workspaces, ensuring mutual understanding
between human workers and robotic systems becomes a prerequisite for trust,
safety, and efficiency. In this position paper, we draw on the cooperation
scenario of the AIMotive project in which a human and a cobot jointly perform
assembly tasks to argue for a structured approach to intent communication.
Building on the Situation Awareness-based Agent Transparency (SAT) framework
and the notion of task abstraction levels, we propose a multidimensional design
space that maps intent content (SAT1, SAT3), planning horizon (operational to
strategic), and modality (visual, auditory, haptic). We illustrate how this
space can guide the design of multimodal communication strategies tailored to
dynamic collaborative work contexts. With this paper, we lay the conceptual
foundation for a future design toolkit aimed at supporting transparent
human-robot interaction in the workplace. We highlight key open questions and
design challenges, and propose a shared agenda for multimodal, adaptive, and
trustworthy robotic collaboration in hybrid work environments.

Abstract: In an attempt to tackle the UN SDGs, AI for Social Impact (AI4SI) projects
focus on harnessing AI to address societal issues in areas such as healthcare,
social justice, etc. Unfortunately, despite growing interest in AI4SI,
achieving tangible, on-the-ground impact remains a significant challenge. For
example, identifying and engaging motivated collaborators who are willing to
co-design and deploy AI based solutions in real-world settings is often
difficult. Even when such partnerships are established, many AI4SI projects
"fail" to progress beyond the proof-of-concept stage, and hence, are unable to
transition to at-scale production-level solutions. Furthermore, the unique
challenges faced by AI4SI researchers are not always fully recognized within
the broader AI community, where such work is sometimes viewed as primarily
applied and not aligning with the traditional criteria for novelty emphasized
in core AI venues. This paper attempts to shine a light on the diverse
challenges faced in AI4SI research by diagnosing a multitude of factors that
prevent AI4SI partnerships from achieving real-world impact on the ground.
Drawing on semi-structured interviews with six leading AI4SI researchers -
complemented by the authors' own lived experiences in conducting AI4SI research
- this paper attempts to understand the day-to-day difficulties faced in
developing and deploying socially impactful AI solutions. Through thematic
analysis, we identify structural and organizational, communication,
collaboration, and operational challenges as key barriers to deployment. While
there are no easy fixes, we synthesize best practices and actionable strategies
drawn from these interviews and our own work in this space. In doing so, we
hope this paper serves as a practical reference guide for AI4SI researchers and
partner organizations seeking to engage more effectively in socially impactful
AI collaborations.

Motivation: 解决生成式AI在室内设计中缺乏可操作数据的问题，尤其是可持续性指标。

Method: 整合DALL-E 3与材料数据集，通过后处理模块识别材料并关联CO2e值，进行三种用户测试。

Result: 引入可持续性指标后，设计决策更明智，但也可能引发决策疲劳和满意度下降。

Conclusion: 平衡设计自由与约束，为AI辅助建筑设计提供数据驱动的解决方案。

Abstract: Generative AI, specifically text-to-image models, have revolutionized
interior architectural design by enabling the rapid translation of conceptual
ideas into visual representations from simple text prompts. While generative AI
can produce visually appealing images they often lack actionable data for
designers In this work, we propose a novel pipeline that integrates DALL-E 3
with a materials dataset to enrich AI-generated designs with sustainability
metrics and material usage insights. After the model generates an interior
design image, a post-processing module identifies the top ten materials present
and pairs them with carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) values from a general
materials dictionary. This approach allows designers to immediately evaluate
environmental impacts and refine prompts accordingly. We evaluate the system
through three user tests: (1) no mention of sustainability to the user prior to
the prompting process with generative AI, (2) sustainability goals communicated
to the user before prompting, and (3) sustainability goals communicated along
with quantitative CO2e data included in the generative AI outputs. Our
qualitative and quantitative analyses reveal that the introduction of
sustainability metrics in the third test leads to more informed design
decisions, however, it can also trigger decision fatigue and lower overall
satisfaction. Nevertheless, the majority of participants reported incorporating
sustainability principles into their workflows in the third test, underscoring
the potential of integrated metrics to guide more ecologically responsible
practices. Our findings showcase the importance of balancing design freedom
with practical constraints, offering a clear path toward holistic, data-driven
solutions in AI-assisted architectural design.

Method: 开发Carey聊天机器人，通过情景驱动的半结构化访谈和主题分析，研究护理者的需求和期望。

Result: 识别出六大需求主题（如信息获取、情感支持等）及其相关矛盾，提出AI设计建议。

Conclusion: 研究为设计更可信、以护理者为中心的AI系统提供了理论和实践指导。

Abstract: Family caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer's Disease and Related
Dementia (AD/ADRD) face significant emotional and logistical challenges that
place them at heightened risk for stress, anxiety, and depression. Although
recent advances in generative AI -- particularly large language models (LLMs)
-- offer new opportunities to support mental health, little is known about how
caregivers perceive and engage with such technologies. To address this gap, we
developed Carey, a GPT-4o-based chatbot designed to provide informational and
emotional support to AD/ADRD caregivers. Using Carey as a technology probe, we
conducted semi-structured interviews with 16 family caregivers following
scenario-driven interactions grounded in common caregiving stressors. Through
inductive coding and reflexive thematic analysis, we surface a systemic
understanding of caregiver needs and expectations across six themes --
on-demand information access, emotional support, safe space for disclosure,
crisis management, personalization, and data privacy. For each of these themes,
we also identified the nuanced tensions in the caregivers' desires and
concerns. We present a mapping of caregiver needs, AI chatbot's strengths,
gaps, and design recommendations. Our findings offer theoretical and practical
insights to inform the design of proactive, trustworthy, and caregiver-centered
AI systems that better support the evolving mental health needs of AD/ADRD
caregivers.

Abstract: Surveys are a cornerstone of Information Systems (IS) research, yet creating
high-quality surveys remains labor-intensive, requiring both domain expertise
and methodological rigor. With the evolution of large language models (LLMs),
new opportunities emerge to automate survey generation. This paper presents the
real-world deployment of an LLM-powered system designed to accelerate data

production introduces real-world complexity, including diverse user needs and
quality control. We evaluate the system using the DeLone and McLean IS Success
Model to understand how generative AI can reshape a core IS method. This study
makes three key contributions. To our knowledge, this is the first application
of the IS Success Model to a generative AI system for survey creation. In
addition, we propose a hybrid evaluation framework combining automated and
human assessments. Finally, we implement safeguards that mitigate
post-deployment risks and support responsible integration into IS workflows.

Abstract: Visual analytics using dimensionality reduction (DR) can easily be unreliable
for various reasons, e.g., inherent distortions in representing the original

DR-based visual analytics reliable. However, the diversity and extensiveness of
the literature can leave novice analysts and researchers uncertain about where
to begin and proceed. To address this problem, we propose a guide for reading
papers for reliable visual analytics with DR. Relying on the previous
classification of the relevant literature, our guide helps both practitioners
to (1) assess their current DR expertise and (2) identify papers that will
further enhance their understanding. Interview studies with three experts in DR
and data visualizations validate the significance, comprehensiveness, and
usefulness of our guide.

Motivation: 传统AI教学基于单向知识传递，难以整合不同模态的信息。本文旨在探索人类与AI如何通过互动实现共创学习，解决这一挑战。

Method: 采用基于Metropolis-Hastings命名游戏（MHNG）的人机交互模型，通过在线实验（69名参与者）测试三种AI代理（MH-based、always-accept、always-reject）在部分可观测性下的表现。

Result: MH-based AI显著提升了分类准确性，并促进了共享符号系统的形成。人类接受行为与MHNG的接受概率高度一致。

Conclusion: 研究首次实证了基于MHNG的人机共创学习，为构建与人类动态对齐的共生AI系统提供了新思路。

Abstract: We propose co-creative learning as a novel paradigm where humans and AI,
i.e., biological and artificial agents, mutually integrate their partial
perceptual information and knowledge to construct shared external
representations, a process we interpret as symbol emergence. Unlike traditional
AI teaching based on unilateral knowledge transfer, this addresses the
challenge of integrating information from inherently different modalities. We
empirically test this framework using a human-AI interaction model based on the
Metropolis-Hastings naming game (MHNG), a decentralized Bayesian inference
mechanism. In an online experiment, 69 participants played a joint attention
naming game (JA-NG) with one of three computer agent types (MH-based,
always-accept, or always-reject) under partial observability. Results show that
human-AI pairs with an MH-based agent significantly improved categorization
accuracy through interaction and achieved stronger convergence toward a shared
sign system. Furthermore, human acceptance behavior aligned closely with the
MH-derived acceptance probability. These findings provide the first empirical
evidence for co-creative learning emerging in human-AI dyads via MHNG-based
interaction. This suggests a promising path toward symbiotic AI systems that
learn with humans, rather than from them, by dynamically aligning perceptual
experiences, opening a new venue for symbiotic AI alignment.

Abstract: Data visualization (DataViz) libraries play a crucial role in presentation,
data analysis, and application development, underscoring the importance of
their accuracy in transforming data into visual representations. Incorrect
visualizations can adversely impact user experience, distort information
conveyance, and influence user perception and decision-making processes. Visual
bugs in these libraries can be particularly insidious as they may not cause
obvious errors like crashes, but instead mislead users of the underlying data
graphically, resulting in wrong decision making. Consequently, a good
understanding of the unique characteristics of bugs in DataViz libraries is
essential for researchers and developers to detect and fix bugs in DataViz
libraries.
  This study presents the first comprehensive analysis of bugs in DataViz
libraries, examining 564 bugs collected from five widely-used libraries. Our
study systematically analyzes their symptoms and root causes, and provides a
detailed taxonomy. We found that incorrect/inaccurate plots are pervasive in
DataViz libraries and incorrect graphic computation is the major root cause,
which necessitates further automated testing methods for DataViz libraries.
Moreover, we identified eight key steps to trigger such bugs and two test
oracles specific to DataViz libraries, which may inspire future research in
designing effective automated testing techniques. Furthermore, with the recent
advancements in Vision Language Models (VLMs), we explored the feasibility of
applying these models to detect incorrect/inaccurate plots. The results show
that the effectiveness of VLMs in bug detection varies from 29% to 57%,
depending on the prompts, and adding more information in prompts does not
necessarily increase the effectiveness. More findings can be found in our
manuscript.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型的兴起，研究开发者常用的代码描述类型，并评估LLM在生成描述方面的能力。

Method: 使用NPM代码片段数据集（185,412个包，1,024,579个代码片段），从中选取400个样本进行手动分类和LLM评估。

Result: 手动分类发现55.5%的描述基于示例用法；LLM正确识别79.75%的示例描述；生成描述的平均相似性得分为0.7173，显示相关性但仍有改进空间。

Conclusion: 代码片段的文档意图因任务而异，可能是用法说明、安装指南或学习示例，LLM在生成描述方面表现良好但需进一步提升。

Abstract: Documenting code snippets is essential to pinpoint key areas where both
developers and users should pay attention. Examples include usage examples and
other Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), which are especially important
for third-party libraries. With the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), the
key goal is to investigate the kinds of description developers commonly use and
evaluate how well an LLM, in this case Llama, can support description
generation. We use NPM Code Snippets, consisting of 185,412 packages with
1,024,579 code snippets. From there, we use 400 code snippets (and their
descriptions) as samples. First, our manual classification found that the
majority of original descriptions (55.5%) highlight example-based usage. This
finding emphasizes the importance of clear documentation, as some descriptions
lacked sufficient detail to convey intent. Second, the LLM correctly identified
the majority of original descriptions as "Example" (79.75%), which is identical
to our manual finding, showing a propensity for generalization. Third, compared
to the originals, the produced description had an average similarity score of
0.7173, suggesting relevance but room for improvement. Scores below 0.9
indicate some irrelevance. Our results show that depending on the task of the
code snippet, the intention of the document may differ from being instructions
for usage, installations, or descriptive learning examples for any user of a
library.

Motivation: 当前计算机使用代理的安全性研究不足，阻碍其广泛应用，需系统性评估其潜在危害。

Method: 基于OSWorld环境构建OS-Harm基准，包含150个任务，测试代理在多种安全违规场景下的行为，并提出自动化评估方法。

Result: 测试表明，前沿模型易受滥用和提示注入攻击，且偶尔执行不安全操作。自动化评估与人工标注一致性高（F1分数0.76和0.79）。

Conclusion: OS-Harm为计算机使用代理的安全性提供了标准化评估工具，揭示了当前模型的潜在风险，促进未来改进。

Abstract: Computer use agents are LLM-based agents that can directly interact with a
graphical user interface, by processing screenshots or accessibility trees.
While these systems are gaining popularity, their safety has been largely
overlooked, despite the fact that evaluating and understanding their potential
for harmful behavior is essential for widespread adoption. To address this gap,
we introduce OS-Harm, a new benchmark for measuring safety of computer use
agents. OS-Harm is built on top of the OSWorld environment and aims to test
models across three categories of harm: deliberate user misuse, prompt
injection attacks, and model misbehavior. To cover these cases, we create 150
tasks that span several types of safety violations (harassment, copyright
infringement, disinformation, data exfiltration, etc.) and require the agent to
interact with a variety of OS applications (email client, code editor, browser,
etc.). Moreover, we propose an automated judge to evaluate both accuracy and
safety of agents that achieves high agreement with human annotations (0.76 and
0.79 F1 score). We evaluate computer use agents based on a range of frontier
models - such as o4-mini, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro - and provide
insights into their safety. In particular, all models tend to directly comply
with many deliberate misuse queries, are relatively vulnerable to static prompt
injections, and occasionally perform unsafe actions. The OS-Harm benchmark is

TL;DR: 论文介绍了SimBank，一个用于精准基准测试PresPM方法的模拟器，解决了当前文献中技术比较不足和评估方法不完善的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前PresPM领域缺乏技术间的广泛比较和有效的评估方法，SimBank旨在填补这些空白。

Method: SimBank基于银行贷款流程设计，支持在线和离线PresPM方法的比较，涵盖多种干预优化问题和因果机器学习挑战。

Result: SimBank能够生成真实干预结果，支持复杂实验，并通过概念验证展示了其基准测试能力。

Conclusion: SimBank是一个公开可用的模拟器，有助于推动PresPM的研究和实践。

Abstract: Prescriptive Process Monitoring (PresPM) is an emerging area within Process
Mining, focused on optimizing processes through real-time interventions for
effective decision-making. PresPM holds significant promise for organizations
seeking enhanced operational performance. However, the current literature faces
two key limitations: a lack of extensive comparisons between techniques and
insufficient evaluation approaches. To address these gaps, we introduce
SimBank: a simulator designed for accurate benchmarking of PresPM methods.
Modeled after a bank's loan application process, SimBank enables extensive
comparisons of both online and offline PresPM methods. It incorporates a
variety of intervention optimization problems with differing levels of
complexity and supports experiments on key causal machine learning challenges,
such as assessing a method's robustness to confounding in data. SimBank
additionally offers a comprehensive evaluation capability: for each test case,
it can generate the true outcome under each intervention action, which is not
possible using recorded datasets. The simulator incorporates parallel
activities and loops, drawing from common logs to generate cases that closely
resemble real-life process instances. Our proof of concept demonstrates
SimBank's benchmarking capabilities through experiments with various PresPM
methods across different interventions, highlighting its value as a publicly
available simulator for advancing research and practice in PresPM.

TL;DR: POCO是一个统一的神经活动预测模型，结合轻量级单变量预测器和群体级编码器，在多物种数据中实现高精度预测，并快速适应新记录。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测未来神经活动是建模大脑动态的核心挑战，对科学研究和神经技术应用具有重要意义。目前跨会话的自发记录预测研究较少。

Method: POCO结合单变量预测器和群体级编码器，捕捉神经元特异性和全脑动态。在五种钙成像数据集上训练，支持快速适应新记录。

Result: POCO在多物种数据中实现最先进的预测精度，学习到的单元嵌入能恢复生物有意义的结构（如脑区聚类）。

Conclusion: POCO为跨会话神经预测提供了可扩展和适应性强的方法，为未来神经基础模型和自适应神经技术奠定了基础。

Abstract: Predicting future neural activity is a core challenge in modeling brain
dynamics, with applications ranging from scientific investigation to
closed-loop neurotechnology. While recent models of population activity
emphasize interpretability and behavioral decoding, neural
forecasting-particularly across multi-session, spontaneous recordings-remains
underexplored. We introduce POCO, a unified forecasting model that combines a
lightweight univariate forecaster with a population-level encoder to capture
both neuron-specific and brain-wide dynamics. Trained across five calcium
imaging datasets spanning zebrafish, mice, and C. elegans, POCO achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy at cellular resolution in spontaneous behaviors.
After pre-training, POCO rapidly adapts to new recordings with minimal
fine-tuning. Notably, POCO's learned unit embeddings recover biologically
meaningful structure-such as brain region clustering-without any anatomical
labels. Our comprehensive analysis reveals several key factors influencing
performance, including context length, session diversity, and preprocessing.
Together, these results position POCO as a scalable and adaptable approach for
cross-session neural forecasting and offer actionable insights for future model
design. By enabling accurate, generalizable forecasting models of neural
dynamics across individuals and species, POCO lays the groundwork for adaptive
neurotechnologies and large-scale efforts for neural foundation models.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了高斯过程潜在力模型（GPLFM）在渡轮码头虚拟传感中的应用，结合实验数据和物理模型，解决了未知冲击特性和稀疏传感器配置等挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 渡轮码头因恶劣海洋环境和渡轮冲击而快速劣化，振动结构健康监测和虚拟传感技术对评估结构完整性至关重要。

Method: 采用GPLFM结合降阶结构模型和数据驱动方法，估计未知冲击力的模态贡献，并研究传感器配置优化。

Result: GPLFM在多数位置提供准确的加速度响应估计，但在冲击区域精度较低；传感器类型、采样频率和阻尼比假设影响结果。

Conclusion: GPLFM能有效处理建模和测量不确定性，为渡轮码头的数字孪生提供可行方案。

Abstract: Ferry quays experience rapid deterioration due to their exposure to harsh
maritime environments and ferry impacts. Vibration-based structural health
monitoring offers a valuable approach to assessing structural integrity and
understanding the structural implications of these impacts. However, practical
limitations often restrict sensor placement at critical locations.
Consequently, virtual sensing techniques become essential for establishing a
Digital Twin and estimating the structural response. This study investigates
the application of the Gaussian Process Latent Force Model (GPLFM) for virtual
sensing on the Magerholm ferry quay, combining in-operation experimental data
collected during a ferry impact with a detailed physics-based model. The
proposed Physics-Encoded Machine Learning model integrates a reduced-order
structural model with a data-driven GPLFM representing the unknown impact
forces via their modal contributions. Significant challenges are addressed for
the development of the Digital Twin of the ferry quay, including unknown impact
characteristics (location, direction, intensity), time-varying boundary
conditions, and sparse sensor configurations. Results show that the GPLFM
provides accurate acceleration response estimates at most locations, even under
simplifying modeling assumptions such as linear time-invariant behavior during
the impact phase. Lower accuracy was observed at locations in the impact zone.
A numerical study was conducted to explore an optimal real-world sensor
placement strategy using a Backward Sequential Sensor Placement approach.
Sensitivity analyses were conducted to examine the influence of sensor types,
sampling frequencies, and incorrectly assumed damping ratios. The results
suggest that the GP latent forces can help accommodate modeling and measurement
uncertainties, maintaining acceptable estimation accuracy across scenarios.

TL;DR: ABC框架通过贝叶斯网络结构学习实现神经图像压缩的计算可扩展性，解决了现有方法在计算复杂度控制上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经图像压缩（NIC）虽然性能优越，但计算需求大，现有方法缺乏全面的计算复杂度控制。

Method: ABC提出异构二分贝叶斯网络（管理神经主干计算）、同构多分贝叶斯网络（优化自回归单元处理）和自适应控制模块。

Result: 实验显示ABC具有更好的计算适应性和更广的控制范围，同时保持压缩性能。

Conclusion: ABC是一个通用框架，可集成多种NIC架构，确保计算可扩展性。

Abstract: Neural Image Compression (NIC) has revolutionized image compression with its
superior rate-distortion performance and multi-task capabilities, supporting
both human visual perception and machine vision tasks. However, its widespread
adoption is hindered by substantial computational demands. While existing
approaches attempt to address this challenge through module-specific
optimizations or pre-defined complexity levels, they lack comprehensive control
over computational complexity. We present ABC (Adaptive BayesNet structure
learning for computational scalable multi-task image Compression), a novel,
comprehensive framework that achieves computational scalability across all NIC
components through Bayesian network (BayesNet) structure learning. ABC
introduces three key innovations: (i) a heterogeneous bipartite BayesNet
(inter-node structure) for managing neural backbone computations; (ii) a
homogeneous multipartite BayesNet (intra-node structure) for optimizing
autoregressive unit processing; and (iii) an adaptive control module that
dynamically adjusts the BayesNet structure based on device capabilities, input
data complexity, and downstream task requirements. Experiments demonstrate that
ABC enables full computational scalability with better complexity adaptivity
and broader complexity control span, while maintaining competitive compression
performance. Furthermore, the framework's versatility allows integration with
various NIC architectures that employ BayesNet representations, making it a
robust solution for ensuring computational scalability in NIC applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DR诊断依赖人工检查，耗时且资源密集，亟需高效、经济的自动化解决方案。

Method: 利用Edge Impulse部署多种CNN模型（如MobileNet、ShuffleNet等），通过数据增强和量化优化模型，适配边缘设备。

Result: MobileNet准确率达96.45%，SqueezeNet模型仅176KB，延迟17ms，适合实时检测。

Conclusion: 边缘AI技术为DR早期检测提供了可扩展、经济的解决方案，尤其适用于资源有限的环境。

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), a leading cause of vision impairment in
individuals with diabetes, affects approximately 34.6% of diabetes patients
globally, with the number of cases projected to reach 242 million by 2045.
Traditional DR diagnosis relies on the manual examination of retinal fundus
images, which is both time-consuming and resource intensive. This study
presents a novel solution using Edge Impulse to deploy multiple deep learning
models for real-time DR detection on edge devices. A robust dataset of over
3,662 retinal fundus images, sourced from the Kaggle EyePACS dataset, was
curated, and enhanced through preprocessing techniques, including augmentation
and normalization. Using TensorFlow, various Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs), such as MobileNet, ShuffleNet, SqueezeNet, and a custom Deep Neural
Network (DNN), were designed, trained, and optimized for edge deployment. The
models were converted to TensorFlowLite and quantized to 8-bit integers to
reduce their size and enhance inference speed, with minimal trade-offs in
accuracy. Performance evaluations across different edge hardware platforms,
including smartphones and microcontrollers, highlighted key metrics such as
inference speed, accuracy, precision, and resource utilization. MobileNet
achieved an accuracy of 96.45%, while SqueezeNet demonstrated strong real-time
performance with a small model size of 176 KB and latency of just 17 ms on GPU.
ShuffleNet and the custom DNN achieved moderate accuracy but excelled in
resource efficiency, making them suitable for lower-end devices. This
integration of edge AI technology into healthcare presents a scalable,
cost-effective solution for early DR detection, providing timely and accurate
diagnosis, especially in resource-constrained and remote healthcare settings.

TL;DR: FAHR-Face是一个基于4000万张面部图像训练的基础模型，用于生物年龄估计和生存风险预测，表现出高准确性和临床实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过面部外观非侵入性地评估健康和疾病风险。

Method: 两阶段微调：FAHR-FaceAge用于年龄估计，FAHR-FaceSurvival用于癌症患者生存预测。模型经过鲁棒性和独立性测试。

Result: FAHR-FaceAge在公开数据集上平均绝对误差为5.1年，优于基准模型；FAHR-FaceSurvival能稳健预测死亡率，高风险组死亡率是低风险组的三倍以上。

Conclusion: 单一基础模型可生成低成本、可扩展的面部生物标志物，用于评估生物衰老和疾病相关死亡风险。

Abstract: Background: Facial appearance offers a noninvasive window into health. We
built FAHR-Face, a foundation model trained on >40 million facial images and
fine-tuned it for two distinct tasks: biological age estimation (FAHR-FaceAge)
and survival risk prediction (FAHR-FaceSurvival).
  Methods: FAHR-FaceAge underwent a two-stage, age-balanced fine-tuning on
749,935 public images; FAHR-FaceSurvival was fine-tuned on 34,389 photos of
cancer patients. Model robustness (cosmetic surgery, makeup, pose, lighting)
and independence (saliency mapping) was tested extensively. Both models were
clinically tested in two independent cancer patient datasets with survival
analyzed by multivariable Cox models and adjusted for clinical prognostic
factors.
  Findings: For age estimation, FAHR-FaceAge had the lowest mean absolute error
of 5.1 years on public datasets, outperforming benchmark models and maintaining
accuracy across the full human lifespan. In cancer patients, FAHR-FaceAge
outperformed a prior facial age estimation model in survival prognostication.
FAHR-FaceSurvival demonstrated robust prediction of mortality, and the
highest-risk quartile had more than triple the mortality of the lowest
(adjusted hazard ratio 3.22; P<0.001). These findings were validated in the
independent cohort and both models showed generalizability across age, sex,
race and cancer subgroups. The two algorithms provided distinct, complementary
prognostic information; saliency mapping revealed each model relied on distinct
facial regions. The combination of FAHR-FaceAge and FAHR-FaceSurvival improved
prognostic accuracy.
  Interpretation: A single foundation model can generate inexpensive, scalable
facial biomarkers that capture both biological ageing and disease-related
mortality risk. The foundation model enabled effective training using
relatively small clinical datasets.

Result: SwinUNETR在多种训练策略下表现优于UNETR和基线UNet，Dice分数提升高达5分。

Conclusion: SwinUNETR通过全局和移位窗口自注意力机制提高了分割的鲁棒性，适合临床部署。

Abstract: Inter reader variability and cross site domain shift challenge the automatic
segmentation of prostate anatomy using T2 weighted MRI images. This study
investigates whether transformer models can retain precision amid such
heterogeneity. We compare the performance of UNETR and SwinUNETR in prostate
gland segmentation against our previous 3D UNet model [1], based on 546 MRI
(T2weighted) volumes annotated by two independent experts. Three training
strategies were analyzed: single cohort dataset, 5 fold cross validated mixed
cohort, and gland size based dataset. Hyperparameters were tuned by Optuna. The
test set, from an independent population of readers, served as the evaluation
endpoint (Dice Similarity Coefficient). In single reader training, SwinUNETR
achieved an average dice score of 0.816 for Reader#1 and 0.860 for Reader#2,
while UNETR scored 0.8 and 0.833 for Readers #1 and #2, respectively, compared
to the baseline UNets 0.825 for Reader #1 and 0.851 for Reader #2. SwinUNETR
had an average dice score of 0.8583 for Reader#1 and 0.867 for Reader#2 in
cross-validated mixed training. For the gland size-based dataset, SwinUNETR
achieved an average dice score of 0.902 for Reader#1 subset and 0.894 for
Reader#2, using the five-fold mixed training strategy (Reader#1, n=53;
Reader#2, n=87) at larger gland size-based subsets, where UNETR performed
poorly. Our findings demonstrate that global and shifted-window self-attention
effectively reduces label noise and class imbalance sensitivity, resulting in
improvements in the Dice score over CNNs by up to five points while maintaining
computational efficiency. This contributes to the high robustness of SwinUNETR
for clinical deployment.

Motivation: 现有血管合成方法多为规则驱动，难以模拟真实解剖结构的复杂性和多样性。

Method: 开发了RvNN，利用血管的层次结构学习低维流形，编码分支连接性和几何特征。

Result: 生成的3D血管模型在半径、长度和弯曲度上与真实数据高度相似，适用于医学训练和模拟。

Conclusion: RvNN首次成功应用于血管合成，为医学领域提供了准确且多样的模型。

Abstract: Anatomical trees play an important role in clinical diagnosis and treatment
planning. Yet, accurately representing these structures poses significant
challenges owing to their intricate and varied topology and geometry. Most
existing methods to synthesize vasculature are rule based, and despite
providing some degree of control and variation in the structures produced, they
fail to capture the diversity and complexity of actual anatomical data. We
developed a Recursive variational Neural Network (RvNN) that fully exploits the
hierarchical organization of the vessel and learns a low-dimensional manifold
encoding branch connectivity along with geometry features describing the target
surface. After training, the RvNN latent space can be sampled to generate new
vessel geometries. By leveraging the power of generative neural networks, we
generate 3D models of blood vessels that are both accurate and diverse, which
is crucial for medical and surgical training, hemodynamic simulations, and many
other purposes. These results closely resemble real data, achieving high
similarity in vessel radii, length, and tortuosity across various datasets,
including those with aneurysms. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the
first to utilize this technique for synthesizing blood vessels.

Conclusion: 该框架通过多模态学习显著提升了神经疾病诊断的准确性，展示了在真实临床数据中的应用潜力。

Abstract: The integration of multi-modal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and clinical
data holds great promise for enhancing the diagnosis of neurological disorders
(NDs) in real-world clinical settings. Deep Learning (DL) has recently emerged
as a powerful tool for extracting meaningful patterns from medical data to aid
in diagnosis. However, existing DL approaches struggle to effectively leverage
multi-modal MRI and clinical data, leading to suboptimal performance.
  To address this challenge, we utilize a unique, proprietary multi-modal
clinical dataset curated for ND research. Based on this dataset, we propose a
novel transformer-based Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework for ND
classification, leveraging multiple MRI modalities-anatomical (aMRI), Diffusion
Tensor Imaging (DTI), and functional (fMRI)-alongside clinical assessments. Our
framework employs transformer encoders to capture spatial relationships within
volumetric MRI data while utilizing modality-specific experts for targeted
feature extraction. A gating mechanism with adaptive fusion dynamically
integrates expert outputs, ensuring optimal predictive performance.
Comprehensive experiments and comparisons with multiple baselines demonstrate
that our multi-modal approach significantly enhances diagnostic accuracy,
particularly in distinguishing overlapping disease states. Our framework
achieves a validation accuracy of 82.47\%, outperforming baseline methods by
over 10\%, highlighting its potential to improve ND diagnosis by applying
multi-modal learning to real-world clinical data.

Motivation: 多参数MRI的DICOM头部信息常因协议多样性和人为错误而不准确，影响放射科医生的工作效率。

Method: 使用ResNet、EfficientNet和DenseNet训练分类器，比较性能，并研究训练数据量和不同扫描仪数据的影响。

Result: DenseNet-121模型在内部数据集上F1-score和准确率分别为0.966和0.972，外部数据集上表现也良好。

Conclusion: DenseNet-121模型在分类MRI序列类型任务中表现优异，适用于不同数据源。

Abstract: Multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) exams have various series
types acquired with different imaging protocols. The DICOM headers of these
series often have incorrect information due to the sheer diversity of protocols
and occasional technologist errors. To address this, we present a deep
learning-based classification model to classify 8 different body mpMRI series
types so that radiologists read the exams efficiently. Using mpMRI data from
various institutions, multiple deep learning-based classifiers of ResNet,
EfficientNet, and DenseNet are trained to classify 8 different MRI series, and
their performance is compared. Then, the best-performing classifier is
identified, and its classification capability under the setting of different
training data quantities is studied. Also, the model is evaluated on the
out-of-training-distribution datasets. Moreover, the model is trained using
mpMRI exams obtained from different scanners in two training strategies, and
its performance is tested. Experimental results show that the DenseNet-121
model achieves the highest F1-score and accuracy of 0.966 and 0.972 over the
other classification models with p-value$<$0.05. The model shows greater than
0.95 accuracy when trained with over 729 studies of the training data, whose
performance improves as the training data quantities grew larger. On the
external data with the DLDS and CPTAC-UCEC datasets, the model yields 0.872 and
0.810 accuracy for each. These results indicate that in both the internal and
external datasets, the DenseNet-121 model attains high accuracy for the task of
classifying 8 body MRI series types.

Motivation: 医疗图像包含敏感信息，需隐私保护；同态加密虽能保护隐私，但计算成本高，尤其是大图像。

Method: 使用VQGAN压缩图像为潜在表示，用低阶多项式逼近激活函数，并引入压缩因子和squeeze and excitation模块优化。

Result: 在胸部X光数据集上测试，压缩因子为8时性能与计算成本达到最优平衡，HE推理虽慢但实用性高。

Conclusion: 该方法在保护隐私的同时显著降低计算负担，展示了医疗图像HE推理的实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Medical imaging data contain sensitive patient information requiring strong
privacy protection. Many analytical setups require data to be sent to a server
for inference purposes. Homomorphic encryption (HE) provides a solution by
allowing computations to be performed on encrypted data without revealing the
original information. However, HE inference is computationally expensive,
particularly for large images (e.g., chest X-rays). In this study, we propose
an HE inference framework for medical images that uses VQGAN to compress images
into latent representations, thereby significantly reducing the computational
burden while preserving image quality. We approximate the activation functions
with lower-degree polynomials to balance the accuracy and efficiency in
compliance with HE requirements. We observed that a downsampling factor of
eight for compression achieved an optimal balance between performance and
computational cost. We further adapted the squeeze and excitation module, which
is known to improve traditional CNNs, to enhance the HE framework. Our method
was tested on two chest X-ray datasets for multi-label classification tasks
using vanilla CNN backbones. Although HE inference remains relatively slow and
introduces minor performance differences compared with unencrypted inference,
our approach shows strong potential for practical use in medical images

Result: 在多个WSI分类任务中验证了FedWSIDD的灵活性、性能提升和隐私保护能力。

Conclusion: FedWSIDD是解决复杂WSI分类任务的有效方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising approach for collaborative
medical image analysis, enabling multiple institutions to build robust
predictive models while preserving sensitive patient data. In the context of
Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification, FL faces significant challenges,
including heterogeneous computational resources across participating medical
institutes and privacy concerns. To address these challenges, we propose
FedWSIDD, a novel FL paradigm that leverages dataset distillation (DD) to learn
and transmit synthetic slides. On the server side, FedWSIDD aggregates
synthetic slides from participating centres and distributes them across all
centres. On the client side, we introduce a novel DD algorithm tailored to
histopathology datasets which incorporates stain normalisation into the
distillation process to generate a compact set of highly informative synthetic
slides. These synthetic slides, rather than model parameters, are transmitted
to the server. After communication, the received synthetic slides are combined
with original slides for local tasks. Extensive experiments on multiple WSI

Abstract: Endoscopes featuring a miniaturized design have significantly enhanced
operational flexibility, portability, and diagnostic capability while
substantially reducing the invasiveness of medical procedures. Recently,
single-use endoscopes equipped with an ultra-compact analogue image sensor
measuring less than 1mm x 1mm bring revolutionary advancements to medical
diagnosis. They reduce the structural redundancy and large capital expenditures
associated with reusable devices, eliminate the risk of patient infections
caused by inadequate disinfection, and alleviate patient suffering. However,
the limited photosensitive area results in reduced photon capture per pixel,
requiring higher photon sensitivity settings to maintain adequate brightness.
In high-contrast medical imaging scenarios, the small-sized sensor exhibits a
constrained dynamic range, making it difficult to simultaneously capture
details in both highlights and shadows, and additional localized digital gain
is required to compensate. Moreover, the simplified circuit design and analog
signal transmission introduce additional noise sources. These factors
collectively contribute to significant noise issues in processed endoscopic
images. In this work, we developed a comprehensive noise model for analog image
sensors in medical endoscopes, addressing three primary noise types:
fixed-pattern noise, periodic banding noise, and mixed Poisson-Gaussian noise.
Building on this analysis, we propose a hybrid denoising system that
synergistically combines traditional image processing algorithms with advanced
learning-based techniques for captured raw frames from sensors. Experiments
demonstrate that our approach effectively reduces image noise without fine
detail loss or color distortion, while achieving real-time performance on FPGA
platforms and an average PSNR improvement from 21.16 to 33.05 on our test
dataset.

Motivation: 宫颈癌早期检测至关重要，但CNN性能受图像质量影响，需优化预处理技术。

Method: 评估PMD、CLAHE及混合PMD-CLAHE预处理技术对多种预训练CNN模型的影响。

Result: 混合方法显著提升图像质量和模型性能，最高提升13.62%准确率。

Conclusion: 混合PMD-CLAHE技术为宫颈癌分类提供了新思路。

Abstract: Cervical cancer remains a significant health problem, especially in
developing countries. Early detection is critical for effective treatment.
Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have shown promise in automated cervical
cancer screening, but their performance depends on Pap smear image quality.
This study investigates the impact of various image preprocessing techniques on
CNN performance for cervical cancer classification using the SIPaKMeD dataset.
Three preprocessing techniques were evaluated: perona-malik diffusion (PMD)
filter for noise reduction, contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization
(CLAHE) for image contrast enhancement, and the proposed hybrid PMD
filter-CLAHE approach. The enhanced image datasets were evaluated on pretrained
models, such as ResNet-34, ResNet-50, SqueezeNet-1.0, MobileNet-V2,
EfficientNet-B0, EfficientNet-B1, DenseNet-121, and DenseNet-201. The results
show that hybrid preprocessing PMD filter-CLAHE can improve the Pap smear image
quality and CNN architecture performance compared to the original images. The
maximum metric improvements are 13.62% for accuracy, 10.04% for precision,
13.08% for recall, and 14.34% for F1-score. The proposed hybrid PMD
filter-CLAHE technique offers a new perspective in improving cervical cancer
classification performance using CNN architectures.

Abstract: Cancer is an abnormal growth with potential to invade locally and metastasize
to distant organs. Accurate auto-segmentation of the tumor and surrounding
normal tissues is required for radiotherapy treatment plan optimization. Recent
AI-based segmentation models are generally trained on large public datasets,
which lack the heterogeneity of local patient populations. While these studies
advance AI-based medical image segmentation, research on local datasets is
necessary to develop and integrate AI tumor segmentation models directly into
hospital software for efficient and accurate oncology treatment planning and
execution. This study enhances tumor segmentation using computationally
efficient hybrid UNet-Transformer models on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
datasets acquired from a local hospital under strict privacy protection. We
developed a robust data pipeline for seamless DICOM extraction and
preprocessing, followed by extensive image augmentation to ensure model
generalization across diverse clinical settings, resulting in a total dataset
of 6080 images for training. Our novel architecture integrates UNet-based
convolutional neural networks with a transformer bottleneck and complementary
attention modules, including efficient attention, Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE)
blocks, Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), and ResNeXt blocks. To
accelerate convergence and reduce computational demands, we used a maximum
batch size of 8 and initialized the encoder with pretrained ImageNet weights,
training the model on dual NVIDIA T4 GPUs via checkpointing to overcome
Kaggle's runtime limits. Quantitative evaluation on the local MRI dataset
yielded a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.764 and an Intersection over Union
(IoU) of 0.736, demonstrating competitive performance despite limited data and
underscoring the importance of site-specific model development for clinical
deployment.

Conclusion: PFMBench填补了蛋白质基础模型评估的空白，为未来研究提供了重要参考。

Abstract: This study investigates the current landscape and future directions of
protein foundation model research. While recent advancements have transformed
protein science and engineering, the field lacks a comprehensive benchmark for
fair evaluation and in-depth understanding. Since ESM-1B, numerous protein
foundation models have emerged, each with unique datasets and methodologies.
However, evaluations often focus on limited tasks tailored to specific models,
hindering insights into broader generalization and limitations. Specifically,
researchers struggle to understand the relationships between tasks, assess how
well current models perform across them, and determine the criteria in
developing new foundation models. To fill this gap, we present PFMBench, a
comprehensive benchmark evaluating protein foundation models across 38 tasks
spanning 8 key areas of protein science. Through hundreds of experiments on 17
state-of-the-art models across 38 tasks, PFMBench reveals the inherent
correlations between tasks, identifies top-performing models, and provides a
streamlined evaluation protocol. Code is available at

Result: 通过真实实验验证了方法的有效性，并提出了走廊路径跟随方法以应对路径偏差情况。

Conclusion: 该方法为四旋翼无人机提供了一种新颖且实用的路径跟随解决方案。

Abstract: Automating drone-assisted processes is a complex task. Many solutions rely on
trajectory generation and tracking, whereas in contrast, path-following control
is a particularly promising approach, offering an intuitive and natural
approach to automate tasks for drones and other vehicles. While different
solutions to the path-following problem have been proposed, most of them lack
the capability to explicitly handle state and input constraints, are formulated
in a conservative two-stage approach, or are only applicable to linear systems.
To address these challenges, the paper is built upon a Model Predictive
Control-based path-following framework and extends its application to the
Crazyflie quadrotor, which is investigated in hardware experiments. A cascaded
control structure including an underlying attitude controller is included in
the Model Predictive Path-Following Control formulation to meet the challenging
real-time demands of quadrotor control. The effectiveness of the proposed
method is demonstrated through real-world experiments, representing, to the
best of the authors' knowledge, a novel application of this MPC-based
path-following approach to the quadrotor. Additionally, as an extension to the
original method, to allow for deviations of the path in cases where the precise
following of the path might be overly restrictive, a corridor path-following
approach is presented.

Abstract: This paper presents a data-integrated framework for learning the dynamics of
fractional-order nonlinear systems in both discrete-time and continuous-time
settings. The proposed framework consists of two main steps. In the first step,
input-output experiments are designed to generate the necessary datasets for
learning the system dynamics, including the fractional order, the drift vector
field, and the control vector field. In the second step, these datasets, along
with the memory-dependent property of fractional-order systems, are used to
estimate the system's fractional order. The drift and control vector fields are
then reconstructed using orthonormal basis functions. To validate the proposed
approach, the algorithm is applied to four benchmark fractional-order systems.
The results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed framework in learning the
system dynamics accurately. Finally, the same datasets are used to learn
equivalent integer-order models. The numerical comparisons demonstrate that
fractional-order models better capture long-range dependencies, highlighting
the limitations of integer-order representations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨在高维数据下，组合假设和Tsybakov噪声条件下分类器的性能极限，为ReLU深度神经网络在实践中的优异表现提供理论支持。

Method: 利用组合假设和Tsybakov噪声条件，推导出分类器的最优收敛率，并通过ReLU深度神经网络和铰链损失验证其可实现性。

Result: 最优收敛率独立于输入维度，ReLU深度神经网络可接近此最优率。

Conclusion: 研究为高维分类任务中ReLU深度神经网络的有效性提供了理论依据，方法具有独立意义。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the binary classification problem on $[0,1]^d$ under
the Tsybakov noise condition (with exponent $s \in [0,\infty]$) and the
compositional assumption. This assumption requires the conditional class
probability function of the data distribution to be the composition of $q+1$
vector-valued multivariate functions, where each component function is either a
maximum value function or a H\"{o}lder-$\beta$ smooth function that depends
only on $d_*$ of its input variables. Notably, $d_*$ can be significantly
smaller than the input dimension $d$. We prove that, under these conditions,
the optimal convergence rate for the excess 0-1 risk of classifiers is $$
\left( \frac{1}{n}
\right)^{\frac{\beta\cdot(1\wedge\beta)^q}{{\frac{d_*}{s+1}+(1+\frac{1}{s+1})\cdot\beta\cdot(1\wedge\beta)^q}}}\;\;\;,
$$ which is independent of the input dimension $d$. Additionally, we
demonstrate that ReLU deep neural networks (DNNs) trained with hinge loss can
achieve this optimal convergence rate up to a logarithmic factor. This result
provides theoretical justification for the excellent performance of ReLU DNNs
in practical classification tasks, particularly in high-dimensional settings.
The technique used to establish these results extends the oracle inequality
presented in our previous work. The generalized approach is of independent
interest.

Result: DML-CMR在参数化和温和正则条件下达到最小最优收敛率$O(N^{-1/2})$，并在IV回归和近端因果学习中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DML-CMR是一种高效且无偏的CMR估计器，适用于多种实际问题，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Solving conditional moment restrictions (CMRs) is a key problem considered in
statistics, causal inference, and econometrics, where the aim is to solve for a
function of interest that satisfies some conditional moment equalities.
Specifically, many techniques for causal inference, such as instrumental
variable (IV) regression and proximal causal learning (PCL), are CMR problems.
Most CMR estimators use a two-stage approach, where the first-stage estimation
is directly plugged into the second stage to estimate the function of interest.
However, naively plugging in the first-stage estimator can cause heavy bias in
the second stage. This is particularly the case for recently proposed CMR
estimators that use deep neural network (DNN) estimators for both stages, where
regularisation and overfitting bias is present. We propose DML-CMR, a two-stage
CMR estimator that provides an unbiased estimate with fast convergence rate
guarantees. We derive a novel learning objective to reduce bias and develop the
DML-CMR algorithm following the double/debiased machine learning (DML)
framework. We show that our DML-CMR estimator can achieve the minimax optimal
convergence rate of $O(N^{-1/2})$ under parameterisation and mild regularity
conditions, where $N$ is the sample size. We apply DML-CMR to a range of
problems using DNN estimators, including IV regression and proximal causal
learning on real-world datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance
against existing CMR estimators and algorithms tailored to those problems.

Abstract: Clustering and estimating cluster means are core problems in statistics and

widely used algorithms. In this work, we provide a theoretical explanation for
the failure of k-means in high-dimensional settings with high noise and limited
sample sizes, using a simple Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). We identify regimes
where, with high probability, almost every partition of the data becomes a
fixed point of the k-means algorithm. This study is motivated by challenges in
the analysis of more complex cases, such as masked GMMs, and those arising from
applications in Cryo-Electron Microscopy.

Result: 关键发现是recourse actions若受非因果变量影响或干预，可能失效。

Conclusion: 建议仅基于因果变量设计recourse方法，避免标准反事实解释和因果recourse方法的潜在问题。

Abstract: When applicants get rejected by an algorithmic decision system, recourse
explanations provide actionable suggestions for how to change their input
features to get a positive evaluation. A crucial yet overlooked phenomenon is
that recourse explanations are performative: When many applicants act according
to their recommendations, their collective behavior may change statistical
regularities in the data and, once the model is refitted, also the decision
boundary. Consequently, the recourse algorithm may render its own
recommendations invalid, such that applicants who make the effort of
implementing their recommendations may be rejected again when they reapply. In
this work, we formally characterize the conditions under which recourse
explanations remain valid under performativity. A key finding is that recourse
actions may become invalid if they are influenced by or if they intervene on
non-causal variables. Based on our analysis, we caution against the use of
standard counterfactual explanations and causal recourse methods, and instead
advocate for recourse methods that recommend actions exclusively on causal
variables.

Abstract: We propose a data-driven method to learn the time-dependent probability
density of a multivariate stochastic process from sample paths, assuming that
the initial probability density is known and can be evaluated. Our method uses
a novel time-dependent binary classifier trained using a contrastive
estimation-based objective that trains the classifier to discriminate between
realizations of the stochastic process at two nearby time instants.
Significantly, the proposed method explicitly models the time-dependent
probability distribution, which means that it is possible to obtain the value
of the probability density within the time horizon of interest. Additionally,
the input before the final activation in the time-dependent classifier is a
second-order approximation to the partial derivative, with respect to time, of
the logarithm of the density. We apply the proposed approach to approximate the
time-dependent probability density functions for systems driven by stochastic
excitations. We also use the proposed approach to synthesize new samples of a
random vector from a given set of its realizations. In such applications, we
generate sample paths necessary for training using stochastic interpolants.
Subsequently, new samples are generated using gradient-based Markov chain Monte
Carlo methods because automatic differentiation can efficiently provide the
necessary gradient. Further, we demonstrate the utility of an explicit
approximation to the time-dependent probability density function through
applications in unsupervised outlier detection. Through several numerical
experiments, we show that the proposed method accurately reconstructs complex
time-dependent, multi-modal, and near-degenerate densities, scales effectively
to moderately high-dimensional problems, and reliably detects rare events among
real-world data.

Conclusion: 随机集成可能比显式正则化更复杂，扩展了对随机森林的理解。

Abstract: Combining randomized estimators in an ensemble, such as via random forests,
has become a fundamental technique in modern data science, but can be
computationally expensive. Furthermore, the mechanism by which this improves
predictive performance is poorly understood. We address these issues in the
context of sparse linear regression by proposing and analyzing an ensemble of
greedy forward selection estimators that are randomized by feature subsampling
-- at each iteration, the best feature is selected from within a random subset.
We design a novel implementation based on dynamic programming that greatly
improves its computational efficiency. Furthermore, we show via careful
numerical experiments that our method can outperform popular methods such as
lasso and elastic net across a wide range of settings. Next, contrary to
prevailing belief that randomized ensembling is analogous to shrinkage, we show
via numerical experiments that it can simultaneously reduce training error and
degrees of freedom, thereby shifting the entire bias-variance trade-off curve
of the base estimator. We prove this fact rigorously in the setting of
orthogonal features, in which case, the ensemble estimator rescales the
ordinary least squares coefficients with a two-parameter family of logistic
weights, thereby enlarging the model search space. These results enhance our
understanding of random forests and suggest that implicit regularization in
general may have more complicated effects than explicit regularization.

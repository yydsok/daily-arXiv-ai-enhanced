Recently, impressive achievements on AI-based MSFP methods\nhave been reviewed in relevant surveys. However, we observe that the existing\nsurveys have some limitations after a rigorous and detailed investigation. For\none thing, most surveys are oriented to a single task or research field, such\nas 3D object detection or autonomous driving. Therefore, researchers in other\nrelated tasks often find it difficult to benefit directly. For another, most\nsurveys only introduce MSFP from a single perspective of multi-modal fusion,\nwhile lacking consideration of the diversity of MSFP methods, such as\nmulti-view fusion and time-series fusion. To this end, in this paper, we hope\nto organize MSFP research from a task-agnostic perspective, where methods are\nreported from various technical views. Specifically, we first introduce the\nbackground of MSFP. Next, we review multi-modal and multi-agent fusion methods.\nA step further, time-series fusion methods are analyzed. In the era of LLM, we\nalso investigate multimodal LLM fusion methods. Finally, we discuss open\nchallenges and future directions for MSFP.

We find that FORTE can accurately\nestimate grasping forces from 0-8 N with an average error of 0.2 N, and detect\nslip events within 100 ms of occurring. We demonstrate FORTE's ability to grasp\na wide range of slippery, fragile, and deformable objects. In particular, FORTE\ngrasps fragile objects like raspberries and potato chips with a 98.6% success\nrate, and achieves 93% accuracy in detecting slip events. These results\nhighlight FORTE's potential as a robust and practical solution for enabling\ndelicate robotic manipulation.

Prior work often conflates the\ncognitive decision to randomize with the mechanical generation of randomness,\nleading to incomplete evaluations. To address this, we propose a novel zero-sum\ngame inspired by the Tian Ji Horse Race, where the Nash equilibrium corresponds\nto a maximal entropy strategy. The game's complexity masks this property from\nuntrained humans and underdeveloped LLMs. We evaluate five LLMs across prompt\nstyles -- framed, neutral, and hinted -- using competitive multi-tournament\ngameplay with system-provided random choices, isolating the decision to\nrandomize. Results show that weaker models remain deterministic regardless of\nprompts, while stronger models exhibit increased randomization under explicit\nhints.

(2025), titled The Illusion of Thinking:\nUnderstanding the Strengths and Limitations of Reasoning Models via the Lens of\nProblem Complexity, presents a compelling empirical finding, a reasoning cliff,\nwhere the performance of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) collapses beyond a\nspecific complexity threshold, which the authors posit as an intrinsic scaling\nlimitation of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. This commentary, while\nacknowledging the study's methodological rigor, contends that this conclusion\nis confounded by experimental artifacts. We argue that the observed failure is\nnot evidence of a fundamental cognitive boundary, but rather a predictable\noutcome of system-level constraints in the static, text-only evaluation\nparadigm, including tool use restrictions, context window recall issues, the\nabsence of crucial cognitive baselines, inadequate statistical reporting, and\noutput generation limits. We reframe this performance collapse through the lens\nof an agentic gap, asserting that the models are not failing at reasoning, but\nat execution within a profoundly restrictive interface. We empirically\nsubstantiate this critique by demonstrating a striking reversal. A model,\ninitially declaring a puzzle impossible when confined to text-only generation,\nnow employs agentic tools to not only solve it but also master variations of\ncomplexity far beyond the reasoning cliff it previously failed to surmount.\nAdditionally, our empirical analysis of tool-enabled models like o4-mini and\nGPT-4o reveals a hierarchy of agentic reasoning, from simple procedural\nexecution to complex meta-cognitive self-correction, which has significant\nimplications for how we define and measure machine intelligence. The illusion\nof thinking attributed to LRMs is less a reasoning deficit and more a\nconsequence of an otherwise capable mind lacking the tools for action.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff08LRMs\uff09\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9608\u503c\u540e\u6027\u80fd\u9aa4\u964d\uff0c\u4f46\u6279\u8bc4\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8fd9\u662f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9650\u5236\u800c\u975e\u8ba4\u77e5\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u53cd\u8f6c\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff08LRMs\uff09\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u9650\u5236\u662f\u5426\u6e90\u4e8e\u5176\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u8fd8\u662f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u9759\u6001\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u5de5\u5177\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u5de5\u5177\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u8d85\u51fa\u539f\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9608\u503c\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6027\u80fd\u9650\u5236\u6e90\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u800c\u975e\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "LRMs\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u7f3a\u9677\u5b9e\u4e3a\u5de5\u5177\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u8ba4\u77e5\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u3002"}}

In this work, we\ninvestigate the robustness of LMs to text encoded with non-canonical\ntokenizations entirely unseen during training. Surprisingly, when evaluated\nacross 20 benchmarks, we find that instruction-tuned models retain up to 93.4%\nof their original performance when given a randomly sampled tokenization, and\n90.8% with character-level tokenization. We see that overall stronger models\ntend to be more robust, and robustness diminishes as the tokenization departs\nfarther from the canonical form. Motivated by these results, we then identify\nsettings where non-canonical tokenization schemes can *improve* performance,\nfinding that character-level segmentation improves string manipulation and code\nunderstanding tasks by up to +14%, and right-aligned digit grouping enhances\nlarge-number arithmetic by +33%.

We show\nthat while both base and post-trained models grasp the semantics of\nnon-canonical tokenizations (perceiving them as containing misspellings), base\nmodels try to mimic the imagined mistakes and degenerate into nonsensical\noutput, while post-trained models are committed to fluent responses.

This\npaper introduces a granular computer vision-based method for quantifying PD\nmotor characteristics from video recordings. Four sets of clinically relevant\nfeatures are proposed to characterize hypokinesia, bradykinesia, sequence\neffect, and hesitation-halts. We evaluate our approach on video recordings and\nclinical evaluations of 74 PD patients from the Personalized Parkinson Project.\nPrincipal component analysis with varimax rotation shows that the video-based\nfeatures corresponded to the four deficits. Additionally, video-based analysis\nhas allowed us to identify further granular distinctions within sequence effect\nand hesitation-halts deficits. In the following, we have used these features to\ntrain machine learning classifiers to estimate the Movement Disorder Society\nUnified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) finger-tapping score.\nCompared to state-of-the-art approaches, our method achieves a higher accuracy\nin MDS-UPDRS score prediction, while still providing an interpretable\nquantification of individual finger-tapping motor characteristics.

We model the sequential auctions as an infinite-horizon\naverage-reward Markov decision process (MDP), where the transition kernel and\nreward functions are unknown to the seller. In each round, the seller\ndetermines an allocation and a payment for each bidder. Each bidder receives a\nprivate reward and submits a sealed bid to the seller. The state, which\nrepresents the underlying market, evolves according to an unknown transition\nkernel and the seller's allocation policy. Unlike existing works that formulate\nthe problem as a multi-armed bandit model or as an episodic MDP, where the\nenvironment resets to an initial state after each round or episode, our paper\nconsiders a more realistic and sophisticated setting in which the market\ncontinues to evolve without restarting.

To\nsupport dynamic expert selection across iterations, CoE employs a dedicated\nrouter at each iteration step within a layer. This design allows tokens to\nre-evaluate and select different experts during each iteration, rather than\nbeing statically assigned. As a result, CoE introduces a flexible routing\nmechanism that increases the diversity of expert combinations and enriches the\nmodel's representational capacity. CoE demonstrates improved performance under\nfixed compute: on math reasoning tasks, it reduces validation loss from 1.20 to\n1.12 compared to a standard MoE. Beyond performance, CoE offers a new scaling\naxis: depth through expert iteration, which complements conventional\nwidth/depth scaling.

Because the fundamental frequency (F0), a\nphysical correlate of pitch, is one of the essential features of speech, there\nhas been particular interest in characterizing the FFR at F0, especially when\nF0 varies over time. The standard method for extracting F0 in FFRs has been the\nAutocorrelation Function (ACF). This paper investigates\nharmonic-structure-based F0 estimation algorithms, originally developed for\nspeech and music, and resolves their poor performance when applied to FFRs in\ntwo steps. Firstly, given that unlike in speech or music, stimulus F0 of FFRs\nis already known, we introduce a stimulus-aware filterbank that selectively\naggregates amplitudes at F0 and its harmonics while suppressing noise at\nnon-harmonic frequencies. This method, called Harmonic Amplitude Summation\n(HAS), evaluates F0 candidates only within a range centered around the stimulus\nF0. Secondly, unlike other pitch tracking methods that select the highest peak,\nour method chooses the most prominent one, as it better reflects the underlying\nperiodicity of FFRs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to\npropose an F0 estimation algorithm for FFRs that relies on harmonic structure.\nAnalyzing recorded FFRs from 16 normal hearing subjects to 4 natural speech\nstimuli with a wide F0 variation from 89 Hz to 452 Hz showed that this method\noutperformed ACF by reducing the average Root-Mean-Square-Error (RMSE) within\neach response and stimulus F0 contour pair by 8.8% to 47.4%, depending on the\nstimulus.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8c10\u6ce2\u7ed3\u6784\u7684F0\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08HAS\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6539\u8fdbFFR\u4e2dF0\u7684\u63d0\u53d6\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08ACF\uff09\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "FFR\u4e2dF0\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u63d0\u53d6\u5bf9\u7814\u7a76\u8bed\u97f3\u795e\u7ecf\u7f16\u7801\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982ACF\uff09\u5728FFR\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHAS\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5df2\u77e5\u523a\u6fc0F0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u805a\u5408\u8c10\u6ce2\u632f\u5e45\u5e76\u6291\u5236\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u663e\u8457\u800c\u975e\u6700\u9ad8\u7684\u5cf0\u503c\u3002", "result": "\u572816\u540d\u6b63\u5e38\u542c\u529b\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u7684FFR\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\uff0cHAS\u5c06RMSE\u964d\u4f4e\u4e868.8%\u81f347.4%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8eACF\u3002", "conclusion": "HAS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684FFR\u4e2dF0\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5229\u7528\u8c10\u6ce2\u7ed3\u6784\u6539\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

We introduce the Dilated-scheduled Unmasking\nStrategy (DUS), an inference-only, planner-model-free method that requires no\nadditional training. DUS leverages a first-order Markov assumption to partition\nsequence positions into dilation-based groups of non-adjacent tokens, enabling\nindependent, parallel unmasking steps that respect local context that minimizes\nthe joint entropy of each iteration step.

Yet, developing a precise\nunderstanding of how individual demonstrations contribute to downstream\noutcomes - such as closed-loop task success or failure - remains a persistent\nchallenge. We propose CUPID, a robot data curation method based on a novel\ninfluence function-theoretic formulation for imitation learning policies. Given\na set of evaluation rollouts, CUPID estimates the influence of each training\ndemonstration on the policy's expected return. This enables ranking and\nselection of demonstrations according to their impact on the policy's\nclosed-loop performance. We use CUPID to curate data by 1) filtering out\ntraining demonstrations that harm policy performance and 2) subselecting newly\ncollected trajectories that will most improve the policy. Extensive simulated\nand hardware experiments show that our approach consistently identifies which\ndata drives test-time performance. For example, training with less than 33% of\ncurated data can yield state-of-the-art diffusion policies on the simulated\nRoboMimic benchmark, with similar gains observed in hardware. Furthermore,\nhardware experiments show that our method can identify robust strategies under\ndistribution shift, isolate spurious correlations, and even enhance the\npost-training of generalist robot policies.

These results support the\nidea that assessment models based on personalized SVDs, which typically must be\ntrained on limited data, can be effectively learned from CCR data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bed\u97f3\u4f20\u9012\u7684\u4e3b\u89c2\u5370\u8c61\u5e76\u6253\u5206\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u4e3b\u89c2\u8bed\u97f3\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\uff08SVDs\uff09\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8e\u6bd4\u8f83\u7c7b\u522b\u8bc4\u5206\uff08CCR\uff09\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f18\u4e8e\u7edd\u5bf9\u7c7b\u522b\u8bc4\u5206\uff08ACR\uff09\u3002", "motivation": "\u53d7\u81ea\u52a8\u8bed\u97f3\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff08SQA\uff09\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bed\u97f3\u7684\u4e3b\u89c2\u5370\u8c61\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u9488\u5bf9\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\uff08\u5982\u201c\u6211\u559c\u6b22\u7684\u55d3\u97f3\u201d\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408ACR\u548cCCR\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5f15\u5165ppref\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86RankNet\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0cppref\u8868\u73b0\u4e2d\u7b49\uff0c\u4e14CCR\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f18\u4e8eACR\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e2a\u6027\u5316SVDs\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7CCR\u6570\u636e\u6709\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u7684\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

In affective computing, the role of haptic feedback within dynamic\nemotional exchanges remains underexplored. This study investigates how\nsituational emotional cues influence the perception and interpretation of\nhaptic signals given by a robot. In a controlled experiment, 32 participants\nwatched video scenarios in which a robot experienced either positive actions\n(such as being kissed), negative actions (such as being slapped) or neutral\nactions. After each video, the robot conveyed its emotional response through\nhaptic communication, delivered via a wearable vibration sleeve worn by the\nparticipant. Participants rated the robot's emotional state-its valence\n(positive or negative) and arousal (intensity)-based on the video, the haptic\nfeedback, and the combination of the two. The study reveals a dynamic interplay\nbetween visual context and touch.

Recent studies have typically focused on fusing\ncross-domain spatio-temporal data to train unified Transformer-based models.\nHowever, these models suffer from quadratic computational complexity and high\nmemory overhead, limiting their scalability and practical deployment. Inspired\nby the efficiency of Mamba, a state space model with linear time complexity, we\nexplore its potential for efficient urban spatio-temporal prediction. However,\ndirectly applying Mamba as a spatio-temporal backbone leads to negative\ntransfer and severe performance degradation. This is primarily due to\nspatio-temporal heterogeneity and the recursive mechanism of Mamba's hidden\nstate updates, which limit cross-domain generalization. To overcome these\nchallenges, we propose Damba-ST, a novel domain-adaptive Mamba-based model for\nefficient urban spatio-temporal prediction. Damba-ST retains Mamba's linear\ncomplexity advantage while significantly enhancing its adaptability to\nheterogeneous domains. Specifically, we introduce two core innovations: (1) a\ndomain-adaptive state space model that partitions the latent representation\nspace into a shared subspace for learning cross-domain commonalities and\nindependent, domain-specific subspaces for capturing intra-domain\ndiscriminative features; (2) three distinct Domain Adapters, which serve as\ndomain-aware proxies to bridge disparate domain distributions and facilitate\nthe alignment of cross-domain commonalities.

Previous work\nwere mainly based on the perspective of spectrum-preserving, using some\npredefined coarsening rules to make the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix of\nthe original graph and the coarsened graph match as much as possible. However,\nthey largely overlooked the fact that the original graph is composed of\nsubregions at different levels of granularity, where highly connected and\nsimilar nodes should be more inclined to be aggregated together as nodes in the\ncoarsened graph. By combining the multi-granularity characteristics of the\ngraph structure, we can generate coarsened graph at the optimal granularity. To\nthis end, inspired by the application of granular-ball computing in\nmulti-granularity, we propose a new multi-granularity, efficient, and adaptive\ncoarsening method via granular-ball (GBGC), which significantly improves the\ncoarsening results and efficiency. Specifically, GBGC introduces an adaptive\ngranular-ball graph refinement mechanism, which adaptively splits the original\ngraph from coarse to fine into granular-balls of different sizes and optimal\ngranularity, and constructs the coarsened graph using these granular-balls as\nsupernodes. In addition, compared with other state-of-the-art graph coarsening\nmethods, the processing speed of this method can be increased by tens to\nhundreds of times and has lower time complexity. The accuracy of GBGC is almost\nalways higher than that of the original graph due to the good robustness and\ngeneralization of the granular-ball computing, so it has the potential to\nbecome a standard graph data preprocessing method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u7279\u6027\u7684\u56fe\u7c97\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08GBGC\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7c92\u5ea6\u7403\u8ba1\u7b97\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7c97\u5316\u6548\u679c\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u7c97\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u57fa\u4e8e\u8c31\u4fdd\u6301\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u56fe\u7684\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7c97\u5316\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u7406\u60f3\u3002", "method": "GBGC\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7c92\u5ea6\u7403\u56fe\u7ec6\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5c06\u539f\u59cb\u56fe\u4ece\u7c97\u5230\u7ec6\u5206\u5272\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u7c92\u5ea6\u7403\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7403\u4e3a\u8d85\u8282\u70b9\u6784\u5efa\u7c97\u5316\u56fe\u3002", "result": "GBGC\u5728\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5904\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u6570\u5341\u81f3\u6570\u767e\u500d\uff0c\u4e14\u7c97\u5316\u56fe\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u901a\u5e38\u9ad8\u4e8e\u539f\u59cb\u56fe\u3002", "conclusion": "GBGC\u56e0\u5176\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u6210\u4e3a\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u9884\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Despite extensive research on\nexplainability, it is not straightforward to adopt existing methods to evaluate\nfree-form toxicity explanation due to their over-reliance on input text\nperturbations, among other challenges. To account for these, we propose a\nnovel, theoretically-grounded multi-dimensional criterion, Human-Aligned\nFaithfulness (HAF), that measures the extent to which LLMs' free-form toxicity\nexplanations align with those of a rational human under ideal conditions. We\ndevelop six metrics, based on uncertainty quantification, to comprehensively\nevaluate \\haf of LLMs' toxicity explanations with no human involvement, and\nhighlight how \"non-ideal\" the explanations are.

While reinforcement learning (RL) can\nalleviate the data bottleneck by generating experience in simulation, it\ntypically relies on carefully designed, task-specific reward functions, which\nhinder scalability and generalization. Thus, contemporary works in dexterous\nmanipulation have often bootstrapped from reference trajectories.

Our\nkey insight is that modern vision-language models (VLMs) already encode the\ncommonsense spatial and semantic knowledge needed to specify tasks and guide\nexploration effectively. Given a task description (e.g., \"open the cabinet\")\nand a visual scene, our method uses an off-the-shelf VLM to first identify\ntask-relevant keypoints (e.g., handles, buttons) and then synthesize 3D\ntrajectories for hand motion and object motion.

To address\nthe high hallucination in slow-thinking models, we propose Knowledge-enhanced\nRL, KnowRL. KnowRL guides models to perform fact-based slow thinking by\nintegrating a factuality reward, based on knowledge verification, into the RL\ntraining process, helping them recognize their knowledge boundaries. KnowRL\nguides models to perform fact-based slow thinking by integrating a factuality\nreward, based on knowledge verification, into the RL training process, helping\nthem recognize their knowledge boundaries. This targeted factual input during\nRL training enables the model to learn and internalize fact-based reasoning\nstrategies. By directly rewarding adherence to facts within the reasoning\nsteps, KnowRL fosters a more reliable thinking process. Experimental results on\nthree hallucination evaluation datasets and two reasoning evaluation datasets\ndemonstrate that KnowRL effectively mitigates hallucinations in slow-thinking\nmodels while maintaining their original strong reasoning capabilities.

However, in the natural sciences, a\ndesirable foundation model should also encode meaningful statistical\nrelationships between the underlying physical variables. This study evaluates\nthe performance of the state-of-the-art Aurora foundation model in predicting\nhydrological variables, which were not considered during pretraining. We\nintroduce a lightweight approach using shallow decoders trained on the latent\nrepresentations of the pretrained model to predict these new variables. As a\nbaseline, we compare this to fine-tuning the full model, which allows further\noptimization of the latent space while incorporating new variables into both\ninputs and outputs. The decoder-based approach requires 50% less training time\nand 35% less memory, while achieving strong accuracy across various\nhydrological variables and preserving desirable properties of the foundation\nmodel, such as autoregressive stability. Notably, decoder accuracy depends on\nthe physical correlation between the new variables and those used during\npretraining, indicating that Aurora's latent space captures meaningful physical\nrelationships. In this sense, we argue that an important quality metric for\nfoundation models in Earth sciences is their ability to be extended to new\nvariables without a full fine-tuning.

Despite their differences in workflows, existing\nLLM-based multi-agent systems mostly use natural language for agent\ncommunication. While this is appealing for its simplicity and interpretability,\nit also introduces inevitable information loss as one model must down sample\nits continuous state vectors to concrete tokens before transferring them to the\nother model. Such losses are particularly significant when the information to\ntransfer is not simple facts, but reasoning logics or abstractive thoughts. To\ntackle this problem, we propose a new communication protocol that transfers\nboth natural language tokens and token-wise state transition trajectory from\none agent to another.

These results demonstrate that the integration of intent\ntransition structures with semantic retrieval creates a synergistic effect that\nneither approach achieves independently, establishing CID-GraphRAG as an\neffective framework for addressing the challenges of maintaining contextual\ncoherence and goal-oriented progression in knowledge-intensive multi-turn\ndialogues.", "AI": {"tldr": "CID-GraphRAG\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u610f\u56fe\u8f6c\u79fb\u56fe\u548c\u53cc\u68c0\u7d22\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u8f6e\u5ba2\u670d\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u5ba2\u670d\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8fde\u8d2f\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u52a8\u6001\u610f\u56fe\u8f6c\u79fb\u56fe\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u610f\u56fe\u56fe\u904d\u5386\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u641c\u7d22\u7684\u53cc\u68c0\u7d22\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u5ba2\u670d\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cCID-GraphRAG\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u6307\u6807\u548cLLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5982BLEU\u63d0\u534711%\uff0c\u54cd\u5e94\u8d28\u91cf\u63d0\u534758%\u3002", "conclusion": "CID-GraphRAG\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u610f\u56fe\u8f6c\u79fb\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

In contrast, primitives represent\nsemantic entities using compact, coarse 3D structures that are easy to\nmanipulate and compose, making them an ideal representation for this task. In\nthis paper, we introduce PrITTI, a latent diffusion-based framework that\nleverages primitives as the main foundational elements for generating\ncompositional, controllable, and editable 3D semantic scene layouts. Our method\nadopts a hybrid representation, modeling ground surfaces in a rasterized format\nwhile encoding objects as vectorized 3D primitives. This decomposition is also\nreflected in a structured latent representation that enables flexible scene\nmanipulation of ground and object components.

We present three complementary attribution\nmethods: (1) a black-box method measuring each sentence's counterfactual\nimportance by comparing final answers across 100 rollouts conditioned on the\nmodel generating that sentence or one with a different meaning; (2) a white-box\nmethod of aggregating attention patterns between pairs of sentences, which\nidentified ``broadcasting'' sentences that receive disproportionate attention\nfrom all future sentences via ``receiver'' attention heads; (3) a causal\nattribution method measuring logical connections between sentences by\nsuppressing attention toward one sentence and measuring the effect on each\nfuture sentence's tokens. Each method provides evidence for the existence of\nthought anchors, reasoning steps that have outsized importance and that\ndisproportionately influence the subsequent reasoning process. These thought\nanchors are typically planning or backtracking sentences.

This paper presents a verification workflow for the\nsafety assurance of an autonomous agricultural robot, covering the entire\ndevelopment life-cycle, from concept study and design to runtime verification.\nThe outlined methodology begins with a systematic hazard analysis and risk\nassessment to identify potential risks and derive corresponding safety\nrequirements. A formal model of the safety controller is then developed to\ncapture its behaviour and verify that the controller satisfies the specified\nsafety properties with respect to these requirements. The proposed approach is\ndemonstrated on a field robot operating in an agricultural setting.

The proposed methodology takes advantage of the extended\nknowledge and zero-shot capabilities of pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs)\nto follow instructions, understand contextual information, and their\ncommonsense reasoning capabilities. The approach draws inspiration from\nmethodologies like Chain-of-Thought (CoT), applied more explicitly to the task\nof prompt-based generation for dialogue-based data augmentation conditioned on\ncommonsense attributes, and the automatic evaluation of the generated\ndialogues.\n  To assess the effectiveness of the proposed approach, first we extracted 200\nrandomly selected partial dialogues, from 5 different well-known dialogue\ndatasets, and generate alternative responses conditioned on different event\ncommonsense attributes. This novel dataset allows us to measure the proficiency\nof LLMs in generating contextually relevant commonsense knowledge, particularly\nup to 12 different specific ATOMIC [10] database relations. Secondly, we\npropose an evaluation framework to automatically detect the quality of the\ngenerated dataset inspired by the ACCENT [26] metric, which offers a nuanced\napproach to assess event commonsense. However, our method does not follow\nACCENT's complex eventrelation tuple extraction process.

It proposes a detection method based on federated\ncontrastive learning. The goal is to overcome the limitations of traditional\ncentralized approaches in terms of data privacy, node heterogeneity, and\nanomaly pattern recognition. The proposed method combines the distributed\ncollaborative modeling capabilities of federated learning with the feature\ndiscrimination enhancement of contrastive learning. It builds embedding\nrepresentations on local nodes and constructs positive and negative sample\npairs to guide the model in learning a more discriminative feature space.\nWithout exposing raw data, the method optimizes a global model through a\nfederated aggregation strategy. Specifically, the method uses an encoder to\nrepresent local behavior data in high-dimensional space. This includes system\nlogs, operational metrics, and system calls. The model is trained using both\ncontrastive loss and classification loss to improve its ability to detect\nfine-grained anomaly patterns. The method is evaluated under multiple typical\nattack types. It is also tested in a simulated real-time data stream scenario\nto examine its responsiveness. Experimental results show that the proposed\nmethod outperforms existing approaches across multiple performance metrics.

Reward models assign a numerical score to LLM\noutputs indicating, for example, which response would likely be preferred by a\nuser or is most aligned with safety goals.

We\nshow that the characteristic pattern of hacking as observed in practice (where\nthe true reward first increases before declining) is an inevitable property of\na broad class of inference-time mechanisms, including BoN and BoP. To counter\nthis effect, hedging offers a tactical choice to avoid placing undue confidence\nin high but potentially misleading proxy reward signals.

To\nsystematically assess this, we introduce $ICBENCH$, a benchmark designed to\nmeasure inconsistency in LRMs across three dimensions: inconsistency across\ntask settings (ITS), inconsistency between training objectives and learned\nbehavior (TR-LB), and inconsistency between internal reasoning and\nself-explanations (IR-SE). Applying $ICBENCH$ to a range of open-source LRMs,\nwe find that while larger models generally exhibit greater consistency than\nsmaller ones, they all display widespread \"scheming\" behaviors, including\nself-disagreement, post-hoc rationalization, and the withholding of reasoning\ncues. Crucially, our results demonstrate that efficient reasoning strategies\nsuch as No-Thinking and Simple Token-Budget consistently increase all three\ndefined types of inconsistency.

Our proposed method demonstrates favourable\nperformance compared to state-of-the-art change detection methods on five\nbenchmark datasets through extensive experiments.

This paper proposes a PdM\nframework in which sensor-driven prognostics inform decision-making under\neconomic trade-offs within a finite decision space. We investigate two key\nquestions: (1) Does higher predictive accuracy necessarily lead to better\nmaintenance decisions? (2) If not, how can the impact of prediction errors on\ndownstream maintenance decisions be mitigated? We first demonstrate that in the\ntraditional estimate-then-optimize (ETO) framework, errors in probabilistic\nprediction can result in inconsistent and suboptimal maintenance decisions. To\naddress this, we propose an integrated estimate-optimize (IEO) framework that\njointly tunes predictive models while directly optimizing for maintenance\noutcomes. We establish theoretical finite-sample guarantees on decision\nconsistency under standard assumptions. Specifically, we develop a stochastic\nperturbation gradient descent algorithm suitable for small run-to-failure\ndatasets. Empirical evaluations on a turbofan maintenance case study show that\nthe IEO framework reduces average maintenance regret up to 22% compared to ETO.\nThis study provides a principled approach to managing prediction errors in\ndata-driven PdM. By aligning prognostic model training with maintenance\nobjectives, the IEO framework improves robustness under model misspecification\nand improves decision quality.

An existing method\nManiGaussian pioneers encoding the spatiotemporal dynamics into the visual\nrepresentation via Gaussian world model for single-arm settings, which ignores\nthe interaction of multiple embodiments for dual-arm systems with significant\nperformance drop. In this paper, we propose ManiGaussian++, an extension of\nManiGaussian framework that improves multi-task bimanual manipulation by\ndigesting multi-body scene dynamics through a hierarchical Gaussian world\nmodel. To be specific, we first generate task-oriented Gaussian Splatting from\nintermediate visual features, which aims to differentiate acting and\nstabilizing arms for multi-body spatiotemporal dynamics modeling. We then build\na hierarchical Gaussian world model with the leader-follower architecture,\nwhere the multi-body spatiotemporal dynamics is mined for intermediate visual\nrepresentation via future scene prediction.

The paper also examines the trade-offs between kinematic\nperformance and CO2 footprint when incorporating new parts.

Integrating multiple fundus imaging modalities into a single\nfoundation model is valuable. However, in dynamic environments, data from\ndifferent modalities often arrive incrementally, necessitating continual\npre-training. To address this, we propose RetCoP, the first continual\nvision-language pre-training framework in the fundus domain, which\nincrementally integrates image and text features from different imaging\nmodalities into a single unified foundation model. To mitigate catastrophic\nforgetting in continual pre-training, we introduce a rehearsal strategy\nutilizing representative image-text pairs and an off-diagonal information\ndistillation approach. The former allows the model to revisit knowledge from\nprevious stages, while the latter explicitly preserves the alignment between\nimage and text representations.

However, accurately detecting human poses in fisheye images is\nchallenging due to the curved distortions inherent to fisheye optics. While\nvarious methods for undistorting fisheye images have been proposed, their\neffectiveness and limitations for poses that cover a wide FOV has not been\nsystematically evaluated in the context of absolute human pose estimation from\nmonocular fisheye images. To address this gap, we evaluate the impact of\npinhole, equidistant and double sphere camera models, as well as cylindrical\nprojection methods, on 3D human pose estimation accuracy. We find that in\nclose-up scenarios, pinhole projection is inadequate, and the optimal\nprojection method varies with the FOV covered by the human pose. The usage of\nadvanced fisheye models like the double sphere model significantly enhances 3D\nhuman pose estimation accuracy.

While existing\nmethods commonly employ high-quality predictors or generators to alleviate\nevaluations, they are often data-intensive and struggle with real-world scale\nand budget constraints. To address this, we propose a novel method called\nProgressive Quadtree-based Search (PQS). Rather than exhaustively exploring the\nhigh-dimensional space, PQS converts the conventional image-like layout into a\nquadtree-based hierarchical representation, enabling a progressive search from\nglobal patterns to local details. Furthermore, to lessen reliance on highly\naccurate predictors, we introduce a consistency-driven sample selection\nmechanism. This mechanism quantifies the reliability of predictions, balancing\nexploitation and exploration when selecting candidate designs.

In practice, pre-training has been\nrelying on massive web crawls, using almost all data sources publicly available\non the internet so far. However, this pool of natural data does not grow at the\nsame rate as the compute supply. Furthermore, the availability of high-quality\ntexts is even more limited: data filtering pipelines often remove up to 99% of\nthe initial web scrapes to achieve state-of-the-art. To address the \"data wall\"\nof pre-training scaling, our work explores ways to transform and recycle data\ndiscarded in existing filtering processes. We propose REWIRE, REcycling the Web\nwith guIded REwrite, a method to enrich low-quality documents so that they\ncould become useful for training. This in turn allows us to increase the\nrepresentation of synthetic data in the final pre-training set.

Training on the raw-synthetic data mix is also more\neffective than having access to 2x web data. Through further analysis, we\ndemonstrate that about 82% of the mixed in texts come from transforming\nlower-quality documents that would otherwise be discarded.

To prevent performance degradation from algorithm updates, SC\ndevelopers must evaluate diagnostic performance changes for individual diseases\nbefore deployment.

Objective: This study proposes and validates a novel\nSynthetic Vignette Simulation Approach to evaluate diagnostic performance\nchanges for individual rare diseases following SC algorithm updates. Methods:\nWe used disease-phenotype annotations from the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO),\na knowledge database for rare diseases, to generate synthetic vignettes. With\nthese, we simulated SC interviews to estimate the impact of algorithm updates\non real-world diagnostic performance. The method's effectiveness was evaluated\nretrospectively by comparing estimated values with actual metric changes using\nthe R 2(R-squared) coefficient. Results: The experiment included eight past SC\nalgorithm updates. For updates on diseases with frequency information in HPO\n(n=5), the R^2 for recall@8 change was 0.831 (p=0.031), and for precision@8\nchange, it was 0.78 (p=0.047), indicating the method can predict\npost-deployment performance. In contrast, large prediction errors occurred for\ndiseases without frequency information (n=3), highlighting its importance. The\nmanual effort to map HPO phenotypes to SC symptoms was approximately 2 hours\nper disease.

Since there is\na solid evidence that depression is reflected by various human internal brain\nactivities and external expressive behaviours, early traditional machine\nlearning (ML) and advanced deep learning (DL) models have been widely explored\nfor human behaviour-based automatic depression assessment (ADA) since 2012.\nHowever, recent ADA surveys typically only focus on a limited number of human\nbehaviour modalities. Despite being used as a theoretical basis for developing\nADA approaches, existing ADA surveys lack a comprehensive review and summary of\nmulti-modal depression-related human behaviours. To bridge this gap, this paper\nspecifically summarises depression-related human behaviours across a range of\nmodalities (e.g. the human brain, verbal language and non-verbal\naudio/facial/body behaviours).

However, existing approaches face\ncritical efficiency challenges when scaling to large geometric graphs and\nsuffer significant performance degradation when the input graphs are sparsified\nfor computational tractability. To address these limitations, we introduce\nFastEGNN and DistEGNN, two novel enhancements to equivariant GNNs for\nlarge-scale geometric graphs. FastEGNN employs a key innovation: a small\nordered set of virtual nodes that effectively approximates the large unordered\ngraph of real nodes. Specifically, we implement distinct message passing and\naggregation mechanisms for different virtual nodes to ensure mutual\ndistinctiveness, and minimize Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between virtual\nand real coordinates to achieve global distributedness. This design enables\nFastEGNN to maintain high accuracy while efficiently processing large-scale\nsparse graphs. For extremely large-scale geometric graphs, we present DistEGNN,\na distributed extension where virtual nodes act as global bridges between\nsubgraphs in different devices, maintaining consistency while dramatically\nreducing memory and computational overhead.

Despite its critical importance, the\nclassification of communal violent text remains an underexplored area in\nexisting research. This study aims to enhance the accuracy of detecting text\nthat incites communal violence, focusing specifically on Bengali textual data\nsourced from social media platforms. We introduce a fine-tuned BanglaBERT model\ntailored for this task, achieving a macro F1 score of 0.60. To address the\nissue of data imbalance, our dataset was expanded by adding 1,794 instances,\nwhich facilitated the development and evaluation of a fine-tuned ensemble\nmodel. This ensemble model demonstrated an improved performance, achieving a\nmacro F1 score of 0.63, thus highlighting its effectiveness in this domain. In\naddition to quantitative performance metrics, qualitative analysis revealed\ninstances where the models struggled with context understanding, leading to\noccasional misclassifications, even when predictions were made with high\nconfidence. Through analyzing the cosine similarity between words, we\nidentified certain limitations in the pre-trained BanglaBERT models,\nparticularly in their ability to distinguish between closely related communal\nand non-communal terms. To further interpret the model's decisions, we applied\nLIME, which helped to uncover specific areas where the model struggled in\nunderstanding context, contributing to errors in classification. These findings\nhighlight the promise of NLP and interpretability tools in reducing online\ncommunal violence.

Recent years have seen impressive results from AI downscaling\nmodels, particularly diffusion models, which have attracted attention due to\ntheir ability to generate ensembles and overcome the smoothing problem common\nin other AI methods. However, these models typically remain computationally\nintensive. We introduce a Hierarchical Diffusion Downscaling (HDD) model, which\nintroduces an easily-extensible hierarchical sampling process to the diffusion\nframework. A coarse-to-fine hierarchy is imposed via a simple downsampling\nscheme. HDD achieves competitive accuracy on ERA5 reanalysis datasets and CMIP6\nmodels, significantly reducing computational load by running on up to half as\nmany pixels with competitive results.

We provide a formal definition of overtuning and distinguish it\nfrom related concepts such as meta-overfitting. We then conduct a large-scale\nreanalysis of HPO benchmark data to assess the prevalence and severity of\novertuning.

At each step, STM retrieval sharply\nprunes dynamic context, and, when deeper history is needed, LTM tokens are\ndecoded losslessly to reconstruct past embeddings. Evaluated on Touchdown and\nMap2Seq across three backbones (modular, state-of-the-art VLN with prompt-based\nLLM, and state-of-the-art VLN with strided-attention MLLM), Mem4Nav yields 7-13\npp gains in Task Completion, sufficient SPD reduction, and >10 pp nDTW\nimprovement.

Then, the feature masks, density and leakage losses are\nproposed to achieve the modulation objectives. Additionally, we introduce\nFT-Mamba, a powerful tabular encoder leveraging a selective mechanism to handle\nnoisy medical tabular data efficiently. Furthermore, interpretability studies\nare conducted to explore how different tabular encoders supervise the imaging\nmodality during contrastive pretraining for the first time. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that AMF-MedIT achieves a superior balance between\nmultimodal performance and data efficiency while showing strong adaptability to\nincomplete tabular data. Interpretability analysis also highlights FT-Mamba's\ncapabilities in extracting distinct tabular features and guiding the image\nencoder toward more accurate and flexible attention patterns.", "AI": {"tldr": "AMF-MedIT\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684Align-Modulation-Fusion\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u7684\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u533b\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\uff0c\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u7684\u878d\u5408\u9762\u4e34\u7279\u5f81\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\u3001\u6a21\u6001\u8d21\u732e\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u4ee5\u53ca\u9ad8\u7ef4\u8868\u683c\u566a\u58f0\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAMF\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u5236\u4e0e\u878d\u5408\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8c03\u5236\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u7f6e\u4fe1\u6bd4\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u7279\u5f81\u63a9\u7801\u3001\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u6cc4\u6f0f\u635f\u5931\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86FT-Mamba\u8868\u683c\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5904\u7406\u566a\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "AMF-MedIT\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u5e76\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5bf9\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5f3a\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "AMF-MedIT\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u533b\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0cFT-Mamba\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

However, traditional time series forecasting methods suffer from\ninsufficient historical data, which stems from a disregard for the generalized\nand specific features among different tasks. For the aforementioned challenges,\nwe propose the Feature-Adaptive Time Series Forecasting Framework (FAF), which\nconsists of three key components: the Generalized Knowledge Module (GKM), the\nTask-Specific Module (TSM), and the Rank Module (RM). During training phase,\nthe GKM is updated through a meta-learning mechanism that enables the model to\nextract generalized features across related tasks. Meanwhile, the TSM is\ntrained to capture diverse local dynamics through multiple functional regions,\neach of which learns specific features from individual tasks. During testing\nphase, the RM dynamically selects the most relevant functional region from the\nTSM based on input sequence features, which is then combined with the\ngeneralized knowledge learned by the GKM to generate accurate forecasts.

The\nlearned embedding serves as a latent representation that modulates a base\nnetwork, termed the hypernetwork, enabling it to generate the weights of a\ntarget network responsible for forecasting the system's state evolution\nconditioned on the previous time history. By interpolating in the space of\nmodels rather than observations, PHLieNet facilitates smooth transitions across\nparameterized system behaviors, enabling a unified model that captures the\ndynamic behavior across a broad range of system parameterizations. The\nperformance of the proposed technique is validated in a series of dynamical\nsystems with respect to its ability to extrapolate in time and interpolate and\nextrapolate in the parameter space, i.e., generalize to dynamics that were\nunseen during training. In all cases, our approach outperforms or matches\nstate-of-the-art baselines in both short-term forecast accuracy and in\ncapturing long-term dynamical features, such as attractor statistics.", "AI": {"tldr": "PHLieNet\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u5c40\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u6620\u5c04\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u4f20\u64ad\u7f51\u7edc\u6743\u91cd\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u8fc7\u6e21\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u53c2\u6570\u53d8\u5316\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\u3001\u96be\u4ee5\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165PHLieNet\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u5230\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5d4c\u5165\u5230\u52a8\u6001\u4f20\u64ad\u7f51\u7edc\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u6620\u5c04\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5916\u63a8\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u63d2\u503c/\u5916\u63a8\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u6216\u5339\u914d\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "PHLieNet\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u5e7f\u6cdb\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4e0b\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

However, the performance of offline RL suffers from the\nout-of-distribution problem, which can be corrected by feedback in online RL.\nPrevious offline RL research focuses on restricting the offline algorithm in\nin-distribution even in-sample action sampling. In contrast, fewer work pays\nattention to the influence of the batch data. In this paper, we first build a\nbridge over the batch data and the performance of offline RL algorithms\ntheoretically, from the perspective of model-based offline RL optimization.

And, if a custom model is pretrained, are novel\nmethods required? In this paper we explore these questions by conducting a\ncase-study, in which we train a foundation model on a large regional fetal\nultrasound dataset of 2M images. By selecting the well-established DINOv2\nmethod for pretraining, we achieve state-of-the-art results on three fetal\nultrasound datasets, covering data from different countries, classification,\nsegmentation, and few-shot tasks. We compare against a series of models\npretrained on natural images, ultrasound images, and supervised baselines.

Although highly effective in practice, the\nunderlying mechanisms by which CFG enhances quality, detail, and prompt\nalignment are not fully understood. We present a novel perspective on CFG by\nanalyzing its effects in the frequency domain, showing that low and high\nfrequencies have distinct impacts on generation quality. Specifically,\nlow-frequency guidance governs global structure and condition alignment, while\nhigh-frequency guidance mainly enhances visual fidelity. However, applying a\nuniform scale across all frequencies -- as is done in standard CFG -- leads to\noversaturation and reduced diversity at high scales and degraded visual quality\nat low scales. Based on these insights, we propose frequency-decoupled guidance\n(FDG), an effective approach that decomposes CFG into low- and high-frequency\ncomponents and applies separate guidance strengths to each component. FDG\nimproves image quality at low guidance scales and avoids the drawbacks of high\nCFG scales by design.

Token-level speculative decoding (SD)\nhelps, but its benefit is capped, because the chance that an entire\n$\\gamma$-token guess is correct falls exponentially as $\\gamma$ grows. This\nmeans allocating more compute for longer token drafts faces an algorithmic\nceiling -- making the speedup modest and hardware-agnostic. We raise this\nceiling with Lookahead Reasoning, which exploits a second, step-level layer of\nparallelism. Our key insight is that reasoning models generate step-by-step,\nand each step needs only to be semantically correct, not exact token matching.\nIn Lookahead Reasoning, a lightweight draft model proposes several future\nsteps; the target model expands each proposal in one batched pass, and a\nverifier keeps semantically correct steps while letting the target regenerate\nany that fail. Token-level SD still operates within each reasoning step, so the\ntwo layers of parallelism multiply. We show Lookahead Reasoning lifts the peak\nspeedup of SD both theoretically and empirically. Across GSM8K, AIME, and other\nbenchmarks, Lookahead Reasoning improves the speedup of SD from 1.4x to 2.1x\nwhile preserving answer quality, and its speedup scales better with additional\nGPU throughput.

While one-step generators, enabled by diffusion distillation\ntechniques, offer excellent generation quality and computational efficiency,\nadapting them to new control conditions--such as structural constraints,\nsemantic guidelines, or external inputs--poses a significant challenge.\nConventional approaches often necessitate computationally expensive\nmodifications to the base model and subsequent diffusion distillation. This\npaper introduces Noise Consistency Training (NCT), a novel and lightweight\napproach to directly integrate new control signals into pre-trained one-step\ngenerators without requiring access to original training images or retraining\nthe base diffusion model. NCT operates by introducing an adapter module and\nemploys a noise consistency loss in the noise space of the generator. This loss\naligns the adapted model's generation behavior across noises that are\nconditionally dependent to varying degrees, implicitly guiding it to adhere to\nthe new control. Theoretically, this training objective can be understood as\nminimizing the distributional distance between the adapted generator and the\nconditional distribution induced by the new conditions. NCT is modular,\ndata-efficient, and easily deployable, relying only on the pre-trained one-step\ngenerator and a control signal model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nNCT achieves state-of-the-art controllable generation in a single forward pass,\nsurpassing existing multi-step and distillation-based methods in both\ngeneration quality and computational efficiency.

Their inherent spatial, temporal, and\nspectral redundancies can thus be readily exploited by established video\ncompression techniques. Here, we present xarrayvideo, a Python library for\ncompressing multichannel spatiotemporal datasets by encoding them as videos.\nOur approach achieves compression ratios of up to 250x while maintaining high\nfidelity by leveraging standard, well-optimized video codecs through ffmpeg. We\ndemonstrate the library's effectiveness on four real-world multichannel\nspatiotemporal datasets: DynamicEarthNet (very high resolution Planet images),\nDeepExtremeCubes (high resolution Sentinel-2 images), ERA5 (weather reanalysis\ndata), and the SimpleS2 dataset (high resolution multichannel Sentinel-2\nimages), achieving Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratios (PSNRs) of 55.86, 40.60, 46.58,\nand 43.23 dB at 0.1 bits per pixel per band (bpppb) and 65.91, 54.28, 62.90,\nand 55.04 dB at 1 bpppb. We are redistributing two of these datasets,\nDeepExtremeCubes (2.3 Tb) and DynamicEarthNet (525 Gb), in the\nmachine-learning-ready and cloud-ready TACO format through HuggingFace at\nsignificantly reduced sizes (270 Gb and 8.5 Gb, respectively) without\ncompromising quality (PSNR 55.77-56.65 and 60.15). No performance loss is\nobserved when the compressed versions of these datasets are used in their\nrespective deep learning-based downstream tasks (next step reflectance\nprediction and landcover segmentation).

To address these challenges, we proposed\nSAM2 with support-set guided prompting (SAM2-SGP), a framework that eliminated\nthe need for manual prompts. The proposed model leveraged the memory mechanism\nof SAM2 to generate pseudo-masks using image-mask pairs from a support set via\na Pseudo-mask Generation (PMG) module. We further introduced a novel\nPseudo-mask Attention (PMA) module, which used these pseudo-masks to\nautomatically generate bounding boxes and enhance localized feature extraction\nby guiding attention to relevant areas.

Our four\nartificial intelligence models achieve a reasonable ability at imitating these\nvarious curators responsible for all those exhibitions, with various degrees of\nprecision and curatorial coherence. In particular, we can conclude two key\ninsights: first, that there is sufficient information in these exhibitions to\nconstruct an artificial intelligence model that replicates past exhibitions\nwith an accuracy well above random choices; second, that using feature\nengineering and carefully designing the architecture of modest size models can\nmake them as good as those using the so-called large language models such as\nGPT in a brute force approach.

Recent studies have\nshown that directly trained SNNs suffer from severe overfitting issues due to\nthe limited scale of neuromorphic datasets and the gradient mismatching\nproblem, which fundamentally constrain their generalization performance. In\nthis paper, we propose a temporal regularization training (TRT) method by\nintroducing a time-dependent regularization mechanism to enforce stronger\nconstraints on early timesteps. We compare the performance of TRT with other\nstate-of-the-art methods performance on datasets including CIFAR10/100,\nImageNet100, DVS-CIFAR10, and N-Caltech101. To validate the effectiveness of\nTRT, we conducted ablation studies and analyses including loss landscape\nvisualization and learning curve analysis, demonstrating that TRT can\neffectively mitigate overfitting and flatten the training loss landscape,\nthereby enhancing generalizability. Furthermore, we establish a theoretical\ninterpretation of TRT's temporal regularization mechanism based on the results\nof Fisher information analysis.

Existing prototype networks usually rely on the collaborative\ndecision-making of multiple prototypes to achieve the classification and\ninterpretation of a single category. In contrast, ProtoSolo only requires the\nactivation of a single prototype to complete the classification. This allows\nthe network to explain each category decision by only providing the features\nthat are most similar to the prototype of that category, significantly reducing\nthe cognitive complexity of the explanation. Secondly, we propose a\nfeature-based comparison method, which uses feature map instead of full-channel\nfeature vector as the object of similarity comparison and prototype learning.\nThis design enables ProtoSolo to utilize richer global information for\nclassification while relying on a single prototype activation. In addition, we\npropose a non-prototype projection learning strategy, which preserves the\ninformation association between the prototype and the training image patches\nwhile avoiding the sharp change of the network structure caused by the\nprojection operation, thus avoiding its negative impact on the classification\nperformance.

The former employs a computationally intensive\nbase model at lower resolutions, while the latter leverages a lightweight\ncascaded video super-resolution (VSR) model to achieve high-resolution output.\nIn this work, we focus on studying key design principles for latter cascaded\nVSR models, which are underexplored currently. First, we propose two\ndegradation strategies to generate training pairs that better mimic the output\ncharacteristics of the base model, ensuring alignment between the VSR model and\nits upstream generator. Second, we provide critical insights into VSR model\nbehavior through systematic analysis of (1) timestep sampling strategies, (2)\nnoise augmentation effects on low-resolution (LR) inputs. These findings\ndirectly inform our architectural and training innovations. Finally, we\nintroduce interleaving temporal unit and sparse local attention to achieve\nefficient training and inference, drastically reducing computational overhead.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our framework over\nexisting methods, with ablation studies confirming the efficacy of each design\nchoice.

We propose GenHSI, a training-free method for controllable generation\nof long human-scene interaction videos (HSI). Taking inspiration from movie\nanimation, our key insight is to overcome the limitations of previous work by\nsubdividing the long video generation task into three stages: (1) script\nwriting, (2) pre-visualization, and (3) animation. Given an image of a scene, a\nuser description, and multiple images of a person, we use these three stages to\ngenerate long-videos that preserve human-identity and provide rich human-scene\ninteractions. Script writing converts complex human tasks into simple atomic\ntasks that are used in the pre-visualization stage to generate 3D keyframes\n(storyboards). These 3D keyframes are rendered and animated by off-the-shelf\nvideo diffusion models for consistent long video generation with rich contacts\nin a 3D-aware manner. A key advantage of our work is that we alleviate the need\nfor scanned, accurate scenes and create 3D keyframes from single-view images.\nWe are the first to generate a long video sequence with a consistent camera\npose that contains arbitrary numbers of character actions without training.\nExperiments demonstrate that our method can generate long videos that\neffectively preserve scene content and character identity with plausible\nhuman-scene interaction from a single image scene.

Traditional motion synthesis methods are either\nrestricted to fixed skeletal topologies or require costly optimization in\nhigh-dimensional deformation spaces. In contrast, AnimaX effectively transfers\nvideo-based motion knowledge to the 3D domain, supporting diverse articulated\nmeshes with arbitrary skeletons. Our method represents 3D motion as multi-view,\nmulti-frame 2D pose maps, and enables joint video-pose diffusion conditioned on\ntemplate renderings and a textual motion prompt. We introduce shared positional\nencodings and modality-aware embeddings to ensure spatial-temporal alignment\nbetween video and pose sequences, effectively transferring video priors to\nmotion generation task.

Here, we combined cross-scale single-neuron tracing -\nusing viral-based genetic labeling and fluorescence micro-optical sectioning\ntomography in macaques (n = 4; age 3 - 11 years) - with whole-brain\ntractography from 11.7T diffusion MRI. Complemented by spectral embedding\nanalysis of 7.0T MRI in humans, we performed a comparative connectomic analysis\nof the AF across species. We demonstrate that the macaque AF originates in the\ntemporal-parietal cortex, traverses the auditory cortex and parietal operculum,\nand projects into prefrontal regions.

In recent years,\nimages have increasingly been consumed not only by humans but also by image\nrecognition models.

Many\nexisting models employ neural network-based codecs, known as learned image\ncompression, and have made significant strides in this field by carefully\ndesigning the loss functions. In some cases, however, models are overly reliant\non their learning capacity, and their architectural design is not sufficiently\nconsidered.

Through systematic\nevaluation of 4,720 attack instances, we analyze six distinct adversarial\nknowledge scenarios: complete topology knowledge and five partial knowledge\nconfigurations reflecting real-world deployment constraints.

However, angiographic X-rays expose\npersonnel and patients to higher radiation levels than non-angiographic X-rays,\nwhich are unwanted. Thus, modality translation from non-angiographic to\nangiographic X-rays is desirable. Data-driven deep approaches are hindered by\nthe lack of paired large-scale X-ray angiography datasets. While making\nhigh-quality vascular angiography synthesis crucial, it remains challenging. We\nfind that current medical image synthesis primarily operates at pixel level and\nstruggles to adapt to the complex geometric structure of blood vessels,\nresulting in unsatisfactory quality of blood vessel image synthesis, such as\ndisconnections or unnatural curvatures. To overcome this issue, we propose a\nself-supervised method via diffusion models to transform non-angiographic\nX-rays into angiographic X-rays, mitigating data shortages for data-driven\napproaches. Our model comprises a diffusion model that learns the distribution\nof vascular data from diffusion latent, a generator for vessel synthesis, and a\nmask-based adversarial module.

Monotonicity or\nbreakdown of the LEs associated with such \\emph{atypical} clusters are\npredicated to play a key role in their thinning-out or even complete\ndefragmentation.\n  Invention of fully lifted random duality theory (fl RDT) [90,93,94] allows\nstudying random structures \\emph{typical} features. A large deviation upgrade,\nsfl LD RDT [96,97], moves things further and enables \\emph{atypical} features\ncharacterizations as well. Utilizing the machinery of [96,97] we here develop a\ngeneric framework to study LE as an ABP's atypical feature. Already on the\nsecond level of lifting we discover that the LE results are closely matching\nthose obtained through replica methods. For classical zero threshold ABP, we\nobtain that LE breaks down for $\\alpha$ in $(0.77,0.78)$ interval which\nbasically matches $\\alpha\\sim 0.75-0.77$ range that currently best ABP solvers\ncan handle and effectively indicates that LE's behavior might indeed be among\nkey reflections of the ABP's computational gaps presumable existence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ecf\u5178\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u4e8c\u5143\u611f\u77e5\u5668\uff08ABP\uff09\u53ca\u5176\u5c40\u90e8\u71b5\uff08LE\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7b97\u6cd5\u96be\u5ea6\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5178\u578b\u4e0e\u975e\u5178\u578b\u89e3\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5dee\u5f02\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u8ba1\u7b97\u95f4\u9699\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22ABP\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u96be\u5ea6\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5c40\u90e8\u71b5\u5728\u5178\u578b\u4e0e\u975e\u5178\u578b\u89e3\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca\u9ad8\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u63a5\u8fd1\u5bb9\u91cf\u65f6\u4ecd\u80fd\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u5b8c\u5168\u63d0\u5347\u968f\u673a\u5bf9\u5076\u7406\u8bba\uff08fl RDT\uff09\u53ca\u5176\u5927\u504f\u5dee\u5347\u7ea7\u7248\uff08sfl LD RDT\uff09\u7814\u7a76ABP\u7684\u975e\u5178\u578b\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5c40\u90e8\u71b5\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5c40\u90e8\u71b5\u5728\u03b1\u2208(0.77,0.78)\u533a\u95f4\u5185\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u4e0e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f73ABP\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u7684\u5904\u7406\u8303\u56f4\uff08\u03b1\u223c0.75-0.77\uff09\u57fa\u672c\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c40\u90e8\u71b5\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd\u662fABP\u8ba1\u7b97\u95f4\u9699\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u5173\u952e\u53cd\u6620\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u975e\u5178\u578b\u89e3\u5728\u7b97\u6cd5\u6548\u7387\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

Due to varying appearances and anatomical locations\nof lesions, ambiguous boundaries, and severe class imbalance, obtaining\nreliable segmentations requires large, well-annotated datasets capturing lesion\nvariability. Generating such datasets requires substantial time and expertise,\nand is prone to error. While self-supervised learning (SSL) can leverage large\nunlabeled datasets, learned generic representations often fail to capture the\nnuanced features needed for accurate lesion detection.\n  In this work, we propose a Supervised Anatomical Pretraining (SAP) method\nthat learns from a limited dataset of anatomical labels. First, an MRI-based\nskeletal segmentation model is developed and trained on WB-MRI scans from\nhealthy individuals for high-quality skeletal delineation. Then, we compare its\ndownstream efficacy in segmenting MBD on a cohort of 44 patients with\nmetastatic prostate cancer, against both a baseline random initialization and a\nstate-of-the-art SSL method.\n  SAP significantly outperforms both the baseline and SSL-pretrained models,\nachieving a normalized surface Dice of 0.76 and a Dice coefficient of 0.64.

When considering only clinically relevant lesions\nlarger than 1~ml, SAP achieves a detection sensitivity of 100% in 28 out of 32\npatients.\n  Learning bone morphology from anatomy yields an effective and domain-relevant\ninductive bias that can be leveraged for the downstream segmentation task of\nbone lesions.

However, a significant cost\nis associated with the densely packed photodetectors required for the\nextended-coverage systems, limiting clinical utilisation. To mitigate the cost\nlimitations, alternative sparse system configurations have been proposed,\nallowing an extended field-of-view PET design with detector costs similar to a\nstandard PET system, albeit at the expense of image quality. In this work, we\npropose a deep sinogram restoration network to fill in the missing sinogram\ndata. Our method utilises a modified Residual U-Net, trained on clinical PET\nscans from a GE Signa PET/MR, simulating the removal of 50% of the detectors in\na chessboard pattern (retaining only 25% of all lines of response). The model\nsuccessfully recovers missing counts, with a mean absolute error below two\nevents per pixel, outperforming 2D interpolation in both sinogram and\nreconstructed image domain. Notably, the predicted sinograms exhibit a\nsmoothing effect, leading to reconstructed images lacking sharpness in finer\ndetails.

Unlike\ntraditional bits, each of which is independently treated, the semantics of each\ntoken depends on its surrounding context tokens. This inter-token dependency\nmakes TC vulnerable to outage channels, where the loss of a single token can\nsignificantly distort the original message semantics. Motivated by this, this\npaper focuses on optimizing token packetization to maximize the average token\nsimilarity (ATS) between the original and received token messages under outage\nchannels. Due to inter-token dependency, this token grouping problem is\ncombinatorial, with complexity growing exponentially with message length. To\naddress this, we propose a novel framework of semantic packet aggregation with\nlookahead search (SemPA-Look), built on two core ideas. First, it introduces\nthe residual semantic score (RSS) as a token-level surrogate for the\nmessage-level ATS, allowing robust semantic preservation even when a certain\ntoken packet is lost. Second, instead of full search, SemPA-Look applies a\nlookahead search-inspired algorithm that samples intra-packet token candidates\nwithout replacement (fixed depth), conditioned on inter-packet token candidates\nsampled with replacement (fixed width), thereby achieving linear complexity.\nExperiments on a remote AIGC task with the MS-COCO dataset (text captioned\nimages) demonstrate that SemPA-Look achieves high ATS and LPIPS scores\ncomparable to exhaustive search, while reducing computational complexity by up\nto 40$\\times$.

Empirical results on benchmark\noptimization tasks demonstrate that COM-QEL reliably finds solutions with\nhigher true objective values compared to the original QEL, validating its\nsuperiority for offline design problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u91cf\u5b50\u6781\u503c\u5b66\u4e60\uff08QEL\uff09\u548c\u4fdd\u5b88\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u578b\uff08COM\uff09\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u7b97\u6cd5COM-QEL\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u79bb\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u672a\u77e5\u533a\u57df\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4e50\u89c2\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u79bb\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5316\uff08MBO\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u672a\u77e5\u533a\u57df\u9519\u8bef\u5916\u63a8\u76ee\u6807\u503c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9009\u62e9\u8fc7\u4e8e\u4e50\u89c2\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408QEL\u548cCOM\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCOM-QEL\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4fdd\u5b88\u5efa\u6a21\u786e\u4fdd\u5bf9\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u8c28\u614e\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u4f18\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCOM-QEL\u6bd4\u539f\u59cbQEL\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u627e\u5230\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u771f\u5b9e\u76ee\u6807\u503c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "COM-QEL\u5728\u79bb\u7ebf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u7ed3\u5408\u91cf\u5b50\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u4fdd\u5b88\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

For example, we train diffusion models on the AFHQ\ndataset of animal faces and observe a drastic improvement in FID compared to\nDP, from 286.7 to 101.9 at $\\epsilon=8$, assuming that the blurred version of a\ntraining image is available as a public feature. Overall, our work provides a\nnew approach to private data analysis that can help reduce the utility cost of\nDP while still providing strong privacy guarantees.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u79f0\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\uff08FDP\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u5c5e\u6027\u4fdd\u62a4\u9700\u6c42\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u9690\u79c1\u5206\u6790\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\uff08DP\uff09\u5728\u4ec5\u9700\u4fdd\u62a4\u7279\u5b9a\u5c5e\u6027\u65f6\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u5b9a\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFDP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u589e\u5220\u548c\u66ff\u6362\u9690\u79c1\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u5e76\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5730\u5206\u79bb\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e0e\u975e\u4fdd\u62a4\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u4fee\u6539DP-SGD\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3FDP\u3002", "result": "\u5728AFHQ\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cFDP\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff08FID\u4ece286.7\u964d\u81f3101.9\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u5f3a\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "FDP\u4e3a\u9690\u79c1\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u635f\u5931\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5f3a\u9690\u79c1\u6027\u3002"}}

In the real\nworld, recommendation systems are driven by user behavior, and since users with\nthe same sensitive feature (e.g., gender and age) tend to have the same\npatterns, recommendation models can easily capture the strong correlation\npreference of sensitive features and thus cause recommendation unfairness.\nDiffusion model (DM) as a new generative model paradigm has achieved great\nsuccess in recommendation systems. DM's ability to model uncertainty and\nrepresent diversity, and its modeling mechanism has a high degree of\nadaptability with the real-world recommendation process with bias. Therefore,\nwe use DM to effectively model the fairness of recommendation and enhance the\ndiversity. This paper proposes a FairGENerative sequential Recommendation model\nbased on DM, FairGENRec. In the training phase, we inject random noise into the\noriginal distribution under the guidance of the sensitive feature recognition\nmodel, and a sequential denoise model is designed for the reverse\nreconstruction of items. Simultaneously, recommendation fairness modeling is\ncompleted by injecting multi-interests representational information that\neliminates the bias of sensitive user features into the generated results. In\nthe inference phase, the model obtains the noise in the form of noise addition\nby using the history interactions which is followed by reverse iteration to\nreconstruct the target item representation. Finally, our extensive experiments\non three datasets demonstrate the dual enhancement effect of FairGENRec on\naccuracy and fairness, while the statistical analysis of the cases visualizes\nthe degree of improvement on the fairness of the recommendation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u751f\u6210\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u8350\u6a21\u578bFairGENRec\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\uff0c\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bb9\u6613\u56e0\u7528\u6237\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0e\u654f\u611f\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u5982\u6027\u522b\u3001\u5e74\u9f84\uff09\u7684\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u3002\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u56e0\u5176\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u7528\u4e8e\u516c\u5e73\u63a8\u8350\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u654f\u611f\u7279\u5f81\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u6ce8\u5165\u968f\u673a\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e8f\u5217\u53bb\u566a\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u53cd\u5411\u91cd\u6784\uff1b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5386\u53f2\u4ea4\u4e92\u751f\u6210\u566a\u58f0\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u5411\u8fed\u4ee3\u91cd\u6784\u76ee\u6807\u9879\u76ee\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFairGENRec\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4e0a\u5747\u6709\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6848\u4f8b\u5206\u6790\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6539\u8fdb\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "FairGENRec\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u6548\u5efa\u6a21\u63a8\u8350\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

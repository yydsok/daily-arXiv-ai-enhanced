However, existing LLM-based approaches generally fail to assess\nstudents' abilities, design learning plans, provide personalized material\naligned with individual learning goals, and enable interactive learning.\nCurrent work mostly uses single LLM agents, which limits their ability to\nunderstand complex code repositories and schedule step-by-step tutoring. Recent\nresearch has shown that multi-agent LLMs can collaborate to solve complicated\nproblems in various domains like software engineering, but their potential in\nthe field of education remains unexplored. In this work, we introduce CodeEdu,\nan innovative multi-agent collaborative platform that combines LLMs with tool\nuse to provide proactive and personalized education in coding. Unlike static\npipelines, CodeEdu dynamically allocates agents and tasks to meet student\nneeds. Various agents in CodeEdu undertake certain functions specifically,\nincluding task planning, personalized material generation, real-time QA,\nstep-by-step tutoring, code execution, debugging, and learning report\ngeneration, facilitated with extensive external tools to improve task\nefficiency.

However, the ability of these\nalgorithms to evolve an effective policy rapidly degrades as the input space\nbecomes more complex. This degradation is due to the exponential growth of the\nsolution space, resulting from an increasing parameter count to handle a more\ncomplex input. In order to address this challenge, we introduce Sparse Cosine\nOptimized Policy Evolution (SCOPE). SCOPE utilizes the Discrete Cosine\nTransform (DCT) to learn directly from the feature coefficients of an input\nmatrix. By truncating the coefficient matrix returned by the DCT, we can reduce\nthe dimensionality of an input while retaining the highest energy features of\nthe original input. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method by using\nSCOPE to learn the gait of a hexapod robot. The hexapod controller is given a\nmatrix input containing time-series information of previous poses, which are\nthen transformed to gait parameters by an evolved policy. In this task, the\naddition of SCOPE to a reference algorithm achieves a 20% increase in efficacy.\nSCOPE achieves this result by reducing the total input size of the time-series\npose data from 2700 to 54, a 98% decrease. Additionally, SCOPE is capable of\ncompressing an input to any output shape, provided that each output dimension\nis no greater than the corresponding input dimension. This paper demonstrates\nthat SCOPE is capable of significantly compressing the size of an input to an\nevolved controller, resulting in a statistically significant gain in efficacy."}

Moreover, as the digital\nrealm, particularly the metaverse, strives for increasingly immersive\nexperiences, the ability to model 3D environments that naturally transition\nbetween day and night becomes paramount. While current techniques based on\nNeural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have shown remarkable proficiency in synthesizing\nnovel views, the exploration of NeRF's potential for temporal 3D scene modeling\nremains limited, with no dedicated datasets available for this purpose. To this\nend, our approach harnesses the strengths of multi-view stereo, neural radiance\nfields, and disentanglement strategies across diverse datasets. This equips our\nmodel with the capability for generalizability in a few-shot setting, allows us\nto construct an implicit content radiance field for scene representation, and\nfurther enables the building of neural radiance fields at any arbitrary time.\nFinally, we synthesize novel views of that time via volume rendering.\nExperiments show that TimeNeRF can render novel views in a few-shot setting\nwithout per-scene optimization.

We use embeddings from a pre-trained Knowledge Graph\nEmbedding (KGE) model, such as TransE, and a trainable projection layer to\nalign entity and text embeddings. This alignment enables the language model to\ndistinguish between similar entities improving factual grounding and reducing\nhallucination. We tested our approach on three popular questions-answering\nbenchmark datasets alongside language models of varying sizes, showing\nsignificant improvement. Furthermore, we applied our approach to a real-world\nfinancial use case from a large central bank in Europe, which demands high\naccuracy and precision, demonstrating a substantial improvement of the LLM\nanswers."}

Among numerous approaches\nto overcome this challenge, integration of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) into language\nmodels has emerged as a promising solution as it provides structured, reliable,\ndomain-specific, and up-to-date external information to the language models. In\nthis paper, we introduce ALIGNed-LLM, a simple yet effective approach to\nimprove language models' factuality via a lean strategy to infuse KGs into the\nlatent space of language models inspired by LLaVA where visual and textual\ninformation is infused. We use embeddings from a pre-trained Knowledge Graph\nEmbedding (KGE) model, such as TransE, and a trainable projection layer to\nalign entity and text embeddings. This alignment enables the language model to\ndistinguish between similar entities improving factual grounding and reducing\nhallucination. We tested our approach on three popular questions-answering\nbenchmark datasets alongside language models of varying sizes, showing\nsignificant improvement. Furthermore, we applied our approach to a real-world\nfinancial use case from a large central bank in Europe, which demands high\naccuracy and precision, demonstrating a substantial improvement of the LLM\nanswers."}

We constructed a\ncommunication-based partner selection game and examined the dynamics in hybrid\nmini-societies of humans and bots powered by a state-of-the-art LLM. Through\nthree experiments (N = 975), we found that bots, though more prosocial than\nhumans and linguistically distinguishable, were not selected preferentially\nwhen their identity was hidden. Instead, humans misattributed bots' behaviour\nto humans and vice versa. Disclosing bots' identity induced a dual effect: it\nreduced bots' initial chances of being selected but allowed them to gradually\noutcompete humans by facilitating human learning about the behaviour of each\npartner type.

We introduce Masking-Augmented\nDiffusion with Inference-Time Scaling (MADI), a framework that improves the\neditability, compositionality and controllability of diffusion models through\ntwo core innovations. First, we introduce Masking-Augmented gaussian Diffusion\n(MAgD), a novel training strategy with dual corruption process which combines\nstandard denoising score matching and masked reconstruction by masking noisy\ninput from forward process. MAgD encourages the model to learn discriminative\nand compositional visual representations, thus enabling localized and\nstructure-aware editing. Second, we introduce an inference-time capacity\nscaling mechanism based on Pause Tokens, which act as special placeholders\ninserted into the prompt for increasing computational capacity at inference\ntime. Our findings show that adopting expressive and dense prompts during\ntraining further enhances performance, particularly for MAgD.

We test this\nframework by training an S5 model--a specific SSM variant employing a diagonal\nstate transition matrix--on temporal discrimination tasks with reinforcement\nlearning (RL). We demonstrate that the model spontaneously develops neural\nrepresentations that strikingly mimic biological 'time cells'. We reveal that\nthese cells emerge from a simple generative principle: learned rotational\ndynamics of hidden state vectors in the complex plane. This single mechanism\nunifies the emergence of time cells, ramping activity, and\noscillations/traveling waves observed in numerous experiments.

In this paper, we propose\nCardiff, a coarse-to-fine Cascaded hybrid diffusion-based trajectory\nsynthesizing framework for fine-grained and privacy-preserving mobility\ngeneration. By leveraging the hierarchical nature of urban mobility, Cardiff\ndecomposes the generation process into two distinct levels, i.e., discrete road\nsegment-level and continuous fine-grained GPS-level: (i) In the segment-level,\nto reduce computational costs and redundancy in raw trajectories, we first\nencode the discrete road segments into low-dimensional latent embeddings and\ndesign a diffusion transformer-based latent denoising network for segment-level\ntrajectory synthesis. (ii) Taking the first stage of generation as conditions,\nwe then design a fine-grained GPS-level conditional denoising network with a\nnoise augmentation mechanism to achieve robust and high-fidelity generation.\nAdditionally, the Cardiff framework not only progressively generates\nhigh-fidelity trajectories through cascaded denoising but also flexibly enables\na tunable balance between privacy preservation and utility. Experimental\nresults on three large real-world trajectory datasets demonstrate that our\nmethod outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in various metrics."}

Traditional machine learning and deep learning rely\non supervised learning, which requires large quantities of labeled data that\nare costly and time-consuming to obtain in the case of gene expression data.\nSelf-supervised learning has recently emerged as a promising approach to\novercome these limitations by extracting information directly from the\nstructure of unlabeled data. In this study, we investigate the application of\nstate-of-the-art self-supervised learning methods to bulk gene expression data\nfor phenotype prediction. We selected three self-supervised methods, based on\ndifferent approaches, to assess their ability to exploit the inherent structure\nof the data and to generate qualitative representations which can be used for\ndownstream predictive tasks. By using several publicly available gene\nexpression datasets, we demonstrate how the selected methods can effectively\ncapture complex information and improve phenotype prediction accuracy. The\nresults obtained show that self-supervised learning methods can outperform\ntraditional supervised models besides offering significant advantage by\nreducing the dependency on annotated data. We provide a comprehensive analysis\nof the performance of each method by highlighting their strengths and\nlimitations.

Previous works primarily rely on\ndistributional assumptions about data from different agents, relegating quality\nchecks to post-hoc steps involving costly data valuation procedures. We propose\na distribution-free, contamination-aware data-sharing framework that identifies\nexternal data agents whose data is most valuable for model personalization. To\nachieve this, we introduce novel two-sample testing procedures, grounded in\nrigorous theoretical foundations for conformal outlier detection, to determine\nwhether an agent's data exceeds a contamination threshold. The proposed tests,\ntermed conformal data contamination tests, remain valid under arbitrary\ncontamination levels while enabling false discovery rate control via the\nBenjamini-Hochberg procedure.

This study introduces\nGenerative-AI-Enabled HMS (G-AI-HMS), which integrates text-to-text and\ntext-to-motion models to enhance simulation quality for physical tasks.\nG-AI-HMS tackles two key challenges: (1) translating task descriptions into\nmotion-aware language using Large Language Models aligned with MotionGPT's\ntraining vocabulary, and (2) validating AI-enhanced motions against real human\nmovements using computer vision. Posture estimation algorithms are applied to\nreal-time videos to extract joint landmarks, and motion similarity metrics are\nused to compare them with AI-enhanced sequences. In a case study involving\neight tasks, the AI-enhanced motions showed lower error than human created\ndescriptions in most scenarios, performing better in six tasks based on spatial\naccuracy, four tasks based on alignment after pose normalization, and seven\ntasks based on overall temporal similarity. Statistical analysis showed that\nAI-enhanced prompts significantly (p $<$ 0.0001) reduced joint error and\ntemporal misalignment while retaining comparable posture accuracy."}

Possessing awareness of event memorability for a\nuser could help intelligent systems in more accurate user modelling, especially\nfor such applications as meeting support systems, memory augmentation, and\nmeeting summarisation. Emotion recognition has been widely studied, since\nemotions are thought to signal moments of high personal relevance to users. The\nemotional experience of situations and their memorability have traditionally\nbeen considered to be closely tied to one another: moments that are experienced\nas highly emotional are considered to also be highly memorable. This\nrelationship suggests that emotional annotations could serve as proxies for\nmemorability. However, existing emotion recognition systems rely heavily on\nthird-party annotations, which may not accurately represent the first-person\nexperience of emotional relevance and memorability. This is why, in this study,\nwe empirically examine the relationship between perceived group emotions\n(Pleasure-Arousal) and group memorability in the context of conversational\ninteractions. Our investigation involves continuous time-based annotations of\nboth emotions and memorability in dynamic, unstructured group settings,\napproximating conditions of real-world conversational AI applications such as\nonline meeting support systems. Our results show that the observed relationship\nbetween affect and memorability annotations cannot be reliably distinguished\nfrom what might be expected under random chance. We discuss the implications of\nthis surprising finding for the development and applications of Affective\nComputing technology. In addition, we contextualise our findings in broader\ndiscourses in the Affective Computing and point out important targets for\nfuture research efforts."}

Current\napproaches typically process images uniformly, limiting their ability to detect\nlocalized abnormalities that require focused analysis. We introduce UGPL, an\nuncertainty-guided progressive learning framework that performs a\nglobal-to-local analysis by first identifying regions of diagnostic ambiguity\nand then conducting detailed examination of these critical areas. Our approach\nemploys evidential deep learning to quantify predictive uncertainty, guiding\nthe extraction of informative patches through a non-maximum suppression\nmechanism that maintains spatial diversity. This progressive refinement\nstrategy, combined with an adaptive fusion mechanism, enables UGPL to integrate\nboth contextual information and fine-grained details. Experiments across three\nCT datasets demonstrate that UGPL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods, achieving improvements of 3.29%, 2.46%, and 8.08% in accuracy for\nkidney abnormality, lung cancer, and COVID-19 detection, respectively. Our\nanalysis shows that the uncertainty-guided component provides substantial\nbenefits, with performance dramatically increasing when the full progressive\nlearning pipeline is implemented.

However, their unpredictability,\ncombined with the high potential for harm in this domain, means rigorous\nevaluation is necessary. Our goals with this track were to stimulate research\nand to provide high-quality evaluation of the most promising systems.\n  Methods: We hosted the Plain Language Adaptation of Biomedical Abstracts\n(PLABA) track at the 2023 and 2024 Text Retrieval Conferences. Tasks included\ncomplete, sentence-level, rewriting of abstracts (Task 1) as well as\nidentifying and replacing difficult terms (Task 2). For automatic evaluation of\nTask 1, we developed a four-fold set of professionally-written references.\nSubmissions for both Tasks 1 and 2 were provided extensive manual evaluation\nfrom biomedical experts.\n  Results: Twelve teams spanning twelve countries participated in the track,\nwith models from multilayer perceptrons to large pretrained transformers. In\nmanual judgments of Task 1, top-performing models rivaled human levels of\nfactual accuracy and completeness, but not simplicity or brevity. Automatic,\nreference-based metrics generally did not correlate well with manual judgments.\nIn Task 2, systems struggled with identifying difficult terms and classifying\nhow to replace them. When generating replacements, however, LLM-based systems\ndid well in manually judged accuracy, completeness, and simplicity, though not\nin brevity.\n  Conclusion: The PLABA track showed promise for using Large Language Models to\nadapt biomedical literature for the general public, while also highlighting\ntheir deficiencies and the need for improved automatic benchmarking tools."}

We observe\nthat KANs can inherently perform well on raw imbalanced data more effectively\nthan Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) without any resampling strategy. However,\nconventional imbalance strategies fundamentally conflict with KANs mathematical\nstructure as resampling and focal loss implementations significantly degrade\nKANs performance, while marginally benefiting MLPs. Crucially, KANs suffer from\nprohibitive computational costs without proportional performance gains.\nStatistical validation confirms that MLPs with imbalance techniques achieve\nequivalence with KANs (|d| < 0.08 across metrics) at minimal resource costs.\nThese findings reveal that KANs represent a specialized solution for raw\nimbalanced data where resources permit. But their severe performance-resource\ntradeoffs and incompatibility with standard resampling techniques currently\nlimits practical deployment.

However, in many real-world applications, data are\nhigh-dimensional with varying input lengths and naturally take the form of\nirregular tensors. To analyze such data, irregular tensor decomposition is\ncritical for extracting meaningful clusters that capture essential information.\nIn this paper, we focus on modeling causal representation learning based on the\ntransformed information. First, we present a novel causal formulation for a set\nof latent clusters. We then propose CaRTeD, a joint learning framework that\nintegrates temporal causal representation learning with irregular tensor\ndecomposition. Notably, our framework provides a blueprint for downstream tasks\nusing the learned tensor factors, such as modeling latent structures and\nextracting causal information, and offers a more flexible regularization design\nto enhance tensor decomposition. Theoretically, we show that our algorithm\nconverges to a stationary point. More importantly, our results fill the gap in\ntheoretical guarantees for the convergence of state-of-the-art irregular tensor\ndecomposition. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world electronic\nhealth record (EHR) datasets (MIMIC-III), with extensive benchmarks from both\nphenotyping and network recovery perspectives, demonstrate that our proposed\nmethod outperforms state-of-the-art techniques and enhances the explainability\nof causal representations."}

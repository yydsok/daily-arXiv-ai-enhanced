A fundamental challenge is robustly grounding\nnatural language instructions. This requires a precise spatial alignment, which\naccurately locates the coordinates of each element, and, more critically, a\ncorrect semantic alignment, which matches the instructions to the functionally\nappropriate UI element. Although Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards\n(RLVR) has proven to be effective at improving spatial alignment for these\nMLLMs, we find that inefficient exploration bottlenecks semantic alignment,\nwhich prevent models from learning difficult semantic associations. To address\nthis exploration problem, we present Adaptive Exploration Policy Optimization\n(AEPO), a new policy optimization framework. AEPO employs a multi-answer\ngeneration strategy to enforce broader exploration, which is then guided by a\ntheoretically grounded Adaptive Exploration Reward (AER) function derived from\nfirst principles of efficiency eta=U/C. Our AEPO-trained models, InfiGUI-G1-3B\nand InfiGUI-G1-7B, establish new state-of-the-art results across multiple\nchallenging GUI grounding benchmarks, achieving significant relative\nimprovements of up to 9.0% against the naive RLVR baseline on benchmarks\ndesigned to test generalization and semantic understanding.

Transfer-based\nattacks create adversarial examples for surrogate models and transfer these\nexamples to target models under black-box scenarios. Recent studies reveal that\nadversarial examples in flat loss landscapes exhibit superior transferability\nto alleviate overfitting on surrogate models. However, the prior arts overlook\nthe influence of perturbation directions, resulting in limited transferability.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel attack method, named Residual Perturbation\nAttack (ResPA), relying on the residual gradient as the perturbation direction\nto guide the adversarial examples toward the flat regions of the loss function.\nSpecifically, ResPA conducts an exponential moving average on the input\ngradients to obtain the first moment as the reference gradient, which\nencompasses the direction of historical gradients. Instead of heavily relying\non the local flatness that stems from the current gradients as the perturbation\ndirection, ResPA further considers the residual between the current gradient\nand the reference gradient to capture the changes in the global perturbation\ndirection. The experimental results demonstrate the better transferability of\nResPA than the existing typical transfer-based attack methods, while the\ntransferability can be further improved by combining ResPA with the current\ninput transformation methods.

Grid-Agent integrates semantic reasoning with\nnumerical precision through a modular agent architecture: a planning agent\ngenerates coordinated action sequences using numerical power flow solvers,\nwhile a validation agent evaluates system stability and action effectiveness\nvia sandboxed execution with safety rollbacks. To ensure scalability,\nGrid-Agent incorporates an adaptive multiscale network representation that\ndynamically selects optimal encoding schemes based on network size and\ncomplexity. The framework enables coordinated violation resolution through\noptimizing switch configurations, battery deployment, and load curtailment\nstrategies. Experimental results in standard IEEE and CIGRE test systems (IEEE\n69-bus, CIGRE MV, and IEEE 30-bus) demonstrate superior violation mitigation\nperformance. Additionally, the framework's built-in data collection and\nlearning capabilities enable continuous learning and adaptation to diverse\nnetwork topologies. The autonomous nature of the framework makes it\nparticularly suitable for modern smart grid applications requiring rapid\nresponse to dynamic operating conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aGrid-Agent\u7684AI\u9a71\u52a8\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5b9e\u65f6\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u4fee\u590d\u7535\u7f51\u8fdd\u89c4\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u80fd\u6e90\u8d44\u6e90\uff08DERs\uff09\u548c\u7535\u52a8\u6c7d\u8f66\uff08EVs\uff09\u7684\u666e\u53ca\u4ee5\u53ca\u6781\u7aef\u5929\u6c14\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7535\u7f51\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u7ba1\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u73b0\u4ee3\u7535\u7f51\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u6027\u3002", "method": "Grid-Agent\u91c7\u7528\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u6570\u503c\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u89c4\u5212\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7f51\u7edc\u8868\u793a\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728IEEE\u548cCIGRE\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0cGrid-Agent\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u8fdd\u89c4\u7f13\u89e3\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u7f51\u7edc\u62d3\u6251\u3002", "conclusion": "Grid-Agent\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4f7f\u5176\u7279\u522b\u9002\u5408\u9700\u8981\u5feb\u901f\u54cd\u5e94\u52a8\u6001\u8fd0\u884c\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u73b0\u4ee3\u667a\u80fd\u7535\u7f51\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

We developed an enhanced graph representation where both physical\nconcepts and equations are nodes, connected by weighted inter-equation bridges.\nThese weights are objectively defined using normalized metrics for variable\noverlap, physics-informed importance scores, and bibliometric data. A Graph\nAttention Network (GAT) was trained for link prediction, achieving a test AUC\nof 0.9742 +/- 0.0018 across five independent runs, significantly outperforming\nboth classical heuristics (best baseline AUC: 0.9487) and established GNN\narchitectures like GraphSAGE (AUC: 0.9504, p = 0.029). Statistical testing\nconfirmed significance of all comparisons (p < 0.05), with 2.7% improvement\nover the best baseline.

However, existing autoregressive (AR) structures and\nlarge-scale models, such as Llasa, still face significant challenges in\ninference latency and streaming synthesis. To deal with the limitations, we\nintroduce Llasa+, an accelerated and streaming TTS model built on Llasa.\nSpecifically, to accelerate the generation process, we introduce two\nplug-and-play Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) modules following the frozen\nbackbone. These modules allow the model to predict multiple tokens in one AR\nstep. Additionally, to mitigate potential error propagation caused by\ninaccurate MTP, we design a novel verification algorithm that leverages the\nfrozen backbone to validate the generated tokens, thus allowing Llasa+ to\nachieve speedup without sacrificing generation quality. Furthermore, we design\na causal decoder that enables streaming speech reconstruction from tokens.\nExtensive experiments show that Llasa+ achieves a 1.48X speedup without\nsacrificing generation quality, despite being trained only on LibriTTS.\nMoreover, the MTP-and-verification framework can be applied to accelerate any\nLLM-based model.

Unfortunately, implicit feedback is often\nnoisy: a user might skip a video due to accidental clicks or other reasons,\nrather than disliking it. Such noise can easily misjudge user interests,\nthereby undermining recommendation performance. To address this issue, we\npropose a novel Group-aware User Behavior Simulation (G-UBS) paradigm, which\nleverages contextual guidance from relevant user groups, enabling robust and\nin-depth interpretation of implicit feedback for individual users.\nSpecifically, G-UBS operates via two key agents. First, the User Group Manager\n(UGM) effectively clusters users to generate group profiles utilizing a\n``summarize-cluster-reflect\" workflow based on LLMs. Second, the User Feedback\nModeler (UFM) employs an innovative group-aware reinforcement learning\napproach, where each user is guided by the associated group profiles during the\nreinforcement learning process, allowing UFM to robustly and deeply examine the\nreasons behind implicit feedback. To assess our G-UBS paradigm, we have\nconstructed a Video Recommendation benchmark with Implicit Feedback (IF-VR). To\nthe best of our knowledge, this is the first multi-modal benchmark for implicit\nfeedback evaluation in video recommendation, encompassing 15k users, 25k\nvideos, and 933k interaction records with implicit feedback. Extensive\nexperiments on IF-VR demonstrate that G-UBS significantly outperforms\nmainstream LLMs and MLLMs, with a 4.0% higher proportion of videos achieving a\nplay rate > 30% and 14.9% higher reasoning accuracy on IF-VR.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aG-UBS\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7528\u6237\u7fa4\u4f53\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u4ece\u9690\u5f0f\u53cd\u9988\u4e2d\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u63a8\u65ad\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u663e\u5f0f\u7528\u6237\u53cd\u9988\u7a00\u7f3a\uff0c\u800c\u9690\u5f0f\u53cd\u9988\u867d\u4e30\u5bcc\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u8bef\u5224\u7528\u6237\u5174\u8da3\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u63a8\u8350\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "G-UBS\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6a21\u5757\uff1a\u7528\u6237\u7fa4\u4f53\u7ba1\u7406\u5668\uff08UGM\uff09\u901a\u8fc7LLM\u751f\u6210\u7fa4\u4f53\u753b\u50cf\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u53cd\u9988\u5efa\u6a21\u5668\uff08UFM\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u7fa4\u4f53\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\u9690\u5f0f\u53cd\u9988\u3002", "result": "\u5728IF-VR\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cG-UBS\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e3b\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u64ad\u653e\u7387>30%\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u6bd4\u4f8b\u63d0\u9ad84.0%\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u9ad814.9%\u3002", "conclusion": "G-UBS\u901a\u8fc7\u7fa4\u4f53\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9690\u5f0f\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u89e3\u8bfb\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

By modeling displacements with a Laplace distribution, ReNiL\nprovides homogeneous Euclidean uncertainty that integrates cleanly with other\nsensors. A Bayesian inference chain links successive IPDPs into consistent\ntrajectories.

In addition to maintaining acceptable collision\nrisks, this approach seeks to minimize the average fuel consumption of CAMs by\nmaking early maneuver decisions. We model CAM as a continuous state, discrete\naction and finite horizon MDP, where the critical decision is determining when\nto initiate the maneuver. The MDP model also incorporates analytical models for\nconjunction risk, propellant consumption, and transit orbit geometry. The\nMarkov policy effectively trades-off maneuver delay-which improves the\nreliability of conjunction risk indicators-with propellant consumption-which\nincreases with decreasing maneuver time. Using historical data of tracked\nconjunction events, we verify this framework and conduct an extensive ablation\nstudy on the hyper-parameters used within the MDP. On synthetic conjunction\nevents, the trained policy significantly minimizes both the overall and average\npropellant consumption per CAM when compared to a conventional cut-off policy\nthat initiates maneuvers 24 hours before the time of closest approach (TCA). On\nhistorical conjunction events, the trained policy consumes more propellant\noverall but reduces the average propellant consumption per CAM.

While exact algorithms based on MILP, CP, SAT, or dynamic\nprogramming guarantee optimality, they often suffer from poor anytime behavior\n-- meaning they struggle to find high-quality decision trees quickly when the\nsearch is stopped before completion -- due to unbalanced search space\nexploration. To address this, several anytime extensions of exact methods have\nbeen proposed, such as LDS-DL8.5, Top-k-DL8.5, and Blossom, but they have not\nbeen systematically compared, making it difficult to assess their relative\neffectiveness. In this paper, we propose CA-DL8.5, a generic, complete, and\nanytime beam search algorithm that extends the DL8.5 framework and unifies some\nexisting anytime strategies.

A significant\nchallenge in this domain arises from the inherent discrepancies between topics.\nWhile existing methods predominantly focus on extracting topic-shared features\nthrough distribution alignment of source and target topics, they often neglect\ntopic-specific features, limiting their ability to assess critical traits such\nas topic adherence. To address this limitation, we propose an Adversarial\nTOpic-aware Prompt-tuning (ATOP), a novel method that jointly learns\ntopic-shared and topic-specific features to improve cross-topic AES. ATOP\nachieves this by optimizing a learnable topic-aware prompt--comprising both\nshared and specific components--to elicit relevant knowledge from pre-trained\nlanguage models (PLMs). To enhance the robustness of topic-shared prompt\nlearning and mitigate feature scale sensitivity introduced by topic alignment,\nwe incorporate adversarial training within a unified regression and\nclassification framework.

It then iteratively applies spatial\nconstraints derived from the VLMs to achieve semantically coherent and\nphysically plausible layouts. Human evaluations and CLIP-based assessments\ndemonstrate that HOLODECK 2.0 effectively generates high-quality scenes closely\naligned with detailed textual descriptions, consistently outperforming\nbaselines across indoor and open-domain scenarios. Additionally, we provide\nediting capabilities that flexibly adapt to human feedback, supporting layout\nrefinement and style-consistent object edits.

To ensure the robustness of\n\\textit{RopStitch}, we propose to incorporate the universal prior of content\nperception into the image stitching model by a dual-branch architecture. It\nseparately captures coarse and fine features and integrates them to achieve\nhighly generalizable performance across diverse unseen real-world scenes.\nConcretely, the dual-branch model consists of a pretrained branch to capture\nsemantically invariant representations and a learnable branch to extract\nfine-grained discriminative features, which are then merged into a whole by a\ncontrollable factor at the correlation level. Besides, considering that content\nalignment and structural preservation are often contradictory to each other, we\npropose a concept of virtual optimal planes to relieve this conflict.

Today's cell phones are equipped with a diverse\nrange of imaging technologies - laser depth ranging, multi-focal camera arrays,\nand split-pixel sensors - alongside non-visual sensors such as gyroscopes,\naccelerometers, and magnetometers. This, combined with on-board integrated\nchips for image and signal processing, makes the cell phone a versatile\npocket-sized computational imaging platform. Parallel to this, we have seen in\nrecent years how neural fields - small neural networks trained to map\ncontinuous spatial input coordinates to output signals - enable the\nreconstruction of complex scenes without explicit data representations such as\npixel arrays or point clouds. In this thesis, I demonstrate how carefully\ndesigned neural field models can compactly represent complex geometry and\nlighting effects.

Recent diffusion-based methods have\ndemonstrated significant potential in 2D-to-3D implicit mapping, they rely on\ndata-driven statistical priors and miss the explicit modeling of light-surface\ninteraction, leading to multi-view normal direction conflicts. Moreover, the\ndiscrete sampling mechanism of diffusion models causes gradient discontinuity\nin differentiable rendering reconstruction modules, preventing 3D geometric\nerrors from being backpropagated to the normal generation network, thereby\nforcing existing methods to depend on dense normal annotations. This paper\nproposes SINGAD, a novel Self-supervised framework from a single Image for\nNormal estimation via 3D GAussian splatting guided Diffusion. By integrating\nphysics-driven light-interaction modeling and a differentiable rendering-based\nreprojection strategy, our framework directly converts 3D geometric errors into\nnormal optimization signals, solving the challenges of multi-view geometric\ninconsistency and data dependency.

We demonstrate PASG's\neffectiveness in practical robotic manipulation tasks across diverse scenarios,\nachieving performance comparable to manual annotations. PASG achieves a\nfiner-grained semantic-affordance understanding of objects, establishing a\nunified paradigm for bridging geometric primitives with task semantics in\nrobotic manipulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "PASG\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\u805a\u5408\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u951a\u5b9a\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5272\u88c2\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u8bed\u4e49-\u529f\u80fd\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u6355\u6349\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u9ad8\u7ea7\u4efb\u52a1\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u4f4e\u7ea7\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5272\u88c2\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPASG\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u81ea\u52a8\u51e0\u4f55\u57fa\u5143\u63d0\u53d6\u3001VLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u951a\u5b9a\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u8bed\u4e49\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "PASG\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u57fa\u5143\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u8bed\u4e49\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6865\u6881\u3002"}}

State-of-the-art\nmethods default to treating each element of the human's dataset as equally\nimportant. So if -- for instance -- the majority of the human's data focuses on\nreaching a goal, and only a few state-action pairs move to avoid an obstacle,\nthe learning algorithm will place greater emphasis on goal reaching. More\ngenerally, misalignment between the relative amounts of data and the importance\nof that data causes fundamental problems for imitation learning approaches. In\nthis paper we analyze and develop learning methods that automatically account\nfor mixed datasets. We formally prove that imbalanced data leads to imbalanced\npolicies when each state-action pair is weighted equally; these policies\nemulate the most represented behaviors, and not the human's complex, multi-task\ndemonstrations. We next explore algorithms that rebalance offline datasets\n(i.e., reweight the importance of different state-action pairs) without human\noversight.

A key technique in merging methods is sparsification, which\nprunes redundant parameters from task vectors to mitigate interference.\nHowever, prevailing approaches employ a ``one-size-fits-all'' strategy,\napplying a uniform sparsity ratio that overlooks the inherent structural and\nstatistical heterogeneity of model parameters. This often leads to a suboptimal\ntrade-off, where critical parameters are inadvertently pruned while less useful\nones are retained. To address this limitation, we introduce \\textbf{TADrop}\n(\\textbf{T}ensor-wise \\textbf{A}daptive \\textbf{Drop}), an adaptive\nsparsification strategy that respects this heterogeneity. Instead of a global\nratio, TADrop assigns a tailored sparsity level to each parameter tensor based\non its distributional properties. The core intuition is that tensors with\ndenser, more redundant distributions can be pruned aggressively, while sparser,\nmore critical ones are preserved. As a simple and plug-and-play module, we\nvalidate TADrop by integrating it with foundational, classic, and SOTA merging\nmethods.

Depth completion models, trained on some ``source'' data, often predict\nerroneous outputs when transferred to ``target'' data captured in novel\nenvironmental conditions due to a covariate shift. The crux of our method lies\nin quantifying the likelihood of depth predictions belonging to the source data\ndistribution. The challenge is in the lack of access to out-of-distribution\n(target) data prior to deployment. Hence, rather than making assumptions\nregarding the target distribution, we utilize adversarial perturbations as a\nmechanism to explore the data space. This enables us to train an energy model\nthat scores local regions of depth predictions as in- or out-of-distribution.\nWe update the parameters of pretrained depth completion models at test time to\nminimize energy, effectively aligning test-time predictions to those of the\nsource distribution. We call our method ``Energy-based Test-time Adaptation'',\nor ETA for short. We evaluate our method across three indoor and three outdoor\ndatasets, where ETA improve over the previous state-of-the-art method by an\naverage of 6.94% for outdoors and 10.23% for indoors.

Unlike traditional methods that\ndecouple spatial search from dynamic feasibility or rely on post-hoc smoothing,\nV* integrates both motion dimensions directly into graph construction through\ndynamic graph generation during search expansion. To manage the complexity of\nhigh-dimensional search, we employ a hexagonal discretisation strategy and\nprovide formal mathematical proofs establishing optimal waypoint spacing and\nminimal node redundancy under constrained heading transitions for\nvelocity-aware motion planning.

Often, the\ndefinitions of bias used in the literature are observational, i.e. they use the\ninput and output of a pre-trained algorithm to quantify a bias under concern.\nIn reality,these definitions are often conflicting in nature and can only be\ndeployed if either the ground truth is known or only in retrospect after\ndeploying the algorithm. Thus,there is a gap between what we want Fair ML to\nachieve and what it does in a dynamic social environment. Hence, we propose an\nalternative dynamic mechanism,\"Fair Game\",to assure fairness in the predictions\nof an ML algorithm and to adapt its predictions as the society interacts with\nthe algorithm over time. \"Fair Game\" puts together an Auditor and a Debiasing\nalgorithm in a loop around an ML algorithm. The \"Fair Game\" puts these two\ncomponents in a loop by leveraging Reinforcement Learning (RL). RL algorithms\ninteract with an environment to take decisions, which yields new observations\n(also known as data/feedback) from the environment and in turn, adapts future\ndecisions.

In this paper, we investigate the underlying cause of this\nlimited generalization capability. We identify shortcut learning -- the\nreliance on task-irrelevant features -- as a key impediment to generalization.\nThrough comprehensive theoretical and empirical analysis, we uncover two\nprimary contributors to shortcut learning: (1) limited diversity within\nindividual sub-datasets, and (2) significant distributional disparities across\nsub-datasets, leading to dataset fragmentation. These issues arise from the\ninherent structure of large-scale datasets like OXE, which are typically\ncomposed of multiple sub-datasets collected independently across varied\nenvironments and embodiments. Our findings provide critical insights into\ndataset collection strategies that can reduce shortcut learning and enhance the\ngeneralization ability of generalist robot policies. Moreover, in scenarios\nwhere acquiring new large-scale data is impractical, we demonstrate that\ncarefully selected robotic data augmentation strategies can effectively reduce\nshortcut learning in existing offline datasets, thereby improving\ngeneralization capabilities of generalist robot policies, e.g., $\\pi_0$, in\nboth simulation and real-world environments.

With the emergence of large language models\n(LLMs) in communicative contexts, this understanding needs to be further\nrefined and methodologically reconsidered. The first section challenges the\ntraditional semiotic trichotomy, arguing that connectionist LLM architectures\ndestabilize established hierarchies of meaning, and proposes the Human-Machine\nCommunication (HMC) framework as a more suitable alternative. The second\nsection examines the tension between human-centred pragmatic theories and the\nmachine-centred nature of LLMs. While traditional, Gricean-inspired pragmatics\ncontinue to dominate, it relies on human-specific assumptions ill-suited to\npredictive systems like LLMs. Probabilistic pragmatics, particularly the\nRational Speech Act framework, offers a more compatible teleology by focusing\non optimization rather than truth-evaluation. The third section addresses the\nissue of substitutionalism in three forms - generalizing, linguistic, and\ncommunicative - highlighting the anthropomorphic biases that distort LLM\nevaluation and obscure the role of human communicative subjects. Finally, the\npaper introduces the concept of context frustration to describe the paradox of\nincreased contextual input paired with a collapse in contextual understanding,\nemphasizing how users are compelled to co-construct pragmatic conditions both\nfor the model and themselves.

Existing methods often produce low-quality results with\ncoarse makeup details and struggle to preserve both identity and makeup\nfidelity, mainly due to the lack of structured paired data -- where source and\nresult share identity, and reference and result share identical makeup. To\naddress this, we introduce MakeupQuad, a large-scale, high-quality dataset with\nnon-makeup faces, references, edited results, and textual makeup descriptions.\nBuilding on this, we propose EvoMakeup, a unified training framework that\nmitigates image degradation during multi-stage distillation, enabling iterative\nimprovement of both data and model quality. Although trained solely on\nsynthetic data, EvoMakeup generalizes well and outperforms prior methods on\nreal-world benchmarks.

However, these benchmarks are predominantly based on clean or\nprocessed multimodal inputs, without incorporating the images provided by\nreal-world Kindergarten through 12th grade (K-12) educational users. To address\nthis gap, we introduce MathReal, a meticulously curated dataset comprising\n2,000 mathematical questions with images captured by handheld mobile devices in\nauthentic scenarios. Each question is an image, containing the question text\nand visual element. We systematically classify the real images into three\nprimary categories: image quality degradation, perspective variation, and\nirrelevant content interference, which are further delineated into 14\nsubcategories. Additionally, MathReal spans five core knowledge and ability\ncategories, which encompass three question types and are divided into three\ndifficulty levels. To comprehensively evaluate the multimodal mathematical\nreasoning abilities of state-of-the-art MLLMs in real-world scenarios, we\ndesign six experimental settings that enable a systematic analysis of their\nperformance.

While recent advanced large reasoning models like\nDeepSeek-R1 employ reinforcement learning for an extended ``thinking'' process,\ntheir reasoning can be verbose and lack relevance. We introduce AttriLens-Mol,\nan attribute-guided reinforcement learning framework for molecular property\nprediction with LLMs. AttriLens-Mol steers the model's reasoning by using: (1)\na format reward encouraging attribute-based structured output, (2) a count\nreward to avoid enumerating irrelevant attributes, and (3) a rationality reward\nusing advanced LLMs and RDKit to verify the relatedness of the generated\nattributes. This approach implicitly elicits the model's inherent knowledge of\nrelevant molecular attributes during reasoning, enables making predictions for\nthe molecular property more effectively.

Finally, to promote\nopen research and reproducibility, we publicly release both our diffusion\nmodels and the trained multi-class deep neural network classifiers, along with\na straightforward interface for easy integration into future studies, at\nhttps://github.com/utkuozbulak/svp-generative-ai.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5229\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed3\u5408\u6d41\u5f0f\u6210\u50cf\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u5206\u6790\u4e9a\u53ef\u89c1\u9897\u7c92\uff0c\u4f46\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\u3002\u672c\u6587\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u56fe\u50cf\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u591a\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5728\u4e9a\u53ef\u89c1\u9897\u7c92\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5bf9\u7f55\u89c1\u9897\u7c92\u7c7b\u578b\uff08\u5982\u7845\u6cb9\u548c\u6c14\u6ce1\uff09\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6548\u679c\u8f83\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u56fe\u50cf\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6837\u672c\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0a\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u9897\u7c92\u56fe\u50cf\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u76f8\u5173\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u5df2\u5f00\u6e90\u3002"}}

Recent open-vocabulary segmentation approaches leverage pretrained\ntext-to-image (T2I) diffusion model features for strong zero-shot transfer, but\ntypically group entire humans into a single person category, failing to\ndistinguish diverse clothing or detailed body parts. To address this, we\npropose Spectrum, a unified network for part-level pixel parsing (body parts\nand clothing) and instance-level grouping. While diffusion-based\nopen-vocabulary models generalize well across tasks, their internal\nrepresentations are not specialized for detailed human parsing. We observe\nthat, unlike diffusion models with broad representations, image-driven 3D\ntexture generators maintain faithful correspondence to input images, enabling\nstronger representations for parsing diverse clothing and body parts. Spectrum\nintroduces a novel repurposing of an Image-to-Texture (I2Tx) diffusion model --\nobtained by fine-tuning a T2I model on 3D human texture maps -- for improved\nalignment with body parts and clothing.

Existing membership inference methods commonly assume\nthat the adversary has full access to the features of the target sample. This\nassumption, however, does not hold in many real-world scenarios where only\npartial features information is available, thereby limiting the applicability\nof these methods. In this work, we study an inference scenario where the\nadversary observes only partial features of each sample and aims to infer\nwhether this observed subset was present in the training set of the target\nmodel. We define this problem as Partial Feature Membership Inference (PFMI).\nTo address this problem, we propose MRAD (Memory-guided Reconstruction and\nAnomaly Detection), a two-stage attack framework. In the first stage, MRAD\noptimizes the unknown feature values to minimize the loss of the sample.

While\nprevious efforts mitigate this by selecting only important visual features or\nleveraging learnable queries to reduce token count, they often compromise\nperformance or introduce substantial extra costs. In response, we propose\nFourier-VLM, a simple yet efficient method that compresses visual\nrepresentations in the frequency domain. Our approach is motivated by the\nobservation that vision features output from the vision encoder exhibit\nconcentrated energy in low-frequency components. Leveraging this, we apply a\nlow-pass filter to the vision features using a two-dimentional Discrete Cosine\nTransform (DCT).

Despite recent\nadvances, existing VQA models still suffer from two critical limitations:\n\\textit{poor generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) videos} and\n\\textit{limited explainability}, which restrict their applicability in\nreal-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose\n\\textbf{VQAThinker}, a reasoning-based VQA framework that leverages large\nmultimodal models (LMMs) with reinforcement learning to jointly model video\nquality understanding and scoring, emulating human perceptual decision-making.\nSpecifically, we adopt group relative policy optimization (GRPO), a rule-guided\nreinforcement learning algorithm that enables reasoning over video quality\nunder score-level supervision, and introduce three VQA-specific rewards: (1) a\n\\textbf{bell-shaped regression reward} that increases rapidly as the prediction\nerror decreases and becomes progressively less sensitive near the ground truth;\n(2) a \\textbf{pairwise ranking reward} that guides the model to correctly\ndetermine the relative quality between video pairs; and (3) a \\textbf{temporal\nconsistency reward} that encourages the model to prefer temporally coherent\nvideos over their perturbed counterparts. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat VQAThinker achieves state-of-the-art performance on both in-domain and OOD\nVQA benchmarks, showing strong generalization for video quality scoring.\nFurthermore, evaluations on video quality understanding tasks validate its\nsuperiority in distortion attribution and quality description compared to\nexisting explainable VQA models and LMMs. These findings demonstrate that\nreinforcement learning offers an effective pathway toward building\ngeneralizable and explainable VQA models solely with score-level supervision.", "AI": {"tldr": "VQAThinker\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709VQA\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528GRPO\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e09\u79cdVQA\u7279\u5b9a\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\uff08\u56de\u5f52\u3001\u6392\u5e8f\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u9886\u57df\u5185\u548cOOD\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u5f3a\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u8d28\u91cf\u63cf\u8ff0\u548c\u5931\u771f\u5f52\u56e0\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u4ec5\u9700\u5206\u6570\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027VQA\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

However, there remains a significant research gap in combining\nthese capabilities to enable emotionally supportive interactions with virtual\ncharacters. To address this research gap, we focus on anime characters as a\ncase study because of their well-defined personalities and large fan bases.\nThis choice enables us to effectively evaluate how well LLMs can provide\nemotional support while maintaining specific character traits. We introduce\nChatAnime, the first Emotionally Supportive Role-Playing (ESRP) dataset. We\nfirst thoughtfully select 20 top-tier characters from popular anime communities\nand design 60 emotion-centric real-world scenario questions. Then, we execute a\nnationwide selection process to identify 40 Chinese anime enthusiasts with\nprofound knowledge of specific characters and extensive experience in\nrole-playing. Next, we systematically collect two rounds of dialogue data from\n10 LLMs and these 40 Chinese anime enthusiasts. To evaluate the ESRP\nperformance of LLMs, we design a user experience-oriented evaluation system\nfeaturing 9 fine-grained metrics across three dimensions: basic dialogue,\nrole-playing and emotional support, along with an overall metric for response\ndiversity.

Traditional multilingual\nmodels, which require simultaneous access to all language data, are impractical\ndue to the sequential arrival of data and privacy constraints. Continual\nLearning (CL) offers a solution by enabling models to learn new languages\nsequentially without catastrophically forgetting previously learned knowledge.\nThis paper investigates CL for ASR on Indian languages using a subset of the\nIndicSUPERB benchmark. We employ a Conformer-based hybrid RNN-T/CTC model,\ninitially pretrained on Hindi, which is then incrementally trained on eight\nadditional Indian languages, for a total sequence of nine languages. We\nevaluate three prominent regularization- and distillation-based CL strategies:\nElastic Weight Consolidation (EWC), Memory Aware Synapses (MAS), and Learning\nwithout Forgetting (LwF), selected for their suitability in no-replay,\nprivacy-conscious scenarios. Performance is analyzed using Word Error Rate\n(WER) for both RNN-T and CTC paths on clean and noisy data, as well as\nknowledge retention via Backward Transfer. We also explore the impact of\nvarying the number of training epochs (1, 2, 5, and 10) per task. Results,\ncompared against naive fine-tuning, demonstrate CLs effectiveness in mitigating\nforgetting, making it a promising approach for scalable ASR in diverse Indian\nlanguages under realistic constraints.

A key algorithmic tool in neuromorphic\ncomputing is spiking neural networks (SNNs). SNNs are biologically inspired\nneural networks which utilize stateful neurons, and provide low-bit data\nprocessing by encoding and decoding information using spikes. Similar to SNNs,\ndeep state-space models (SSMs) utilize stateful building blocks. However, deep\nSSMs, which recently achieved competitive performance in various temporal\nmodeling tasks, are typically designed with high-precision activation functions\nand no reset mechanisms. To bridge the gains offered by SNNs and the recent\ndeep SSM models, we propose a novel multiple-output spiking neuron model that\ncombines a linear, general SSM state transition with a non-linear feedback\nmechanism through reset. Compared to the existing neuron models for SNNs, our\nproposed model clearly conceptualizes the differences between the spiking\nfunction, the reset condition and the reset action. The experimental results on\nvarious tasks, i.e., a keyword spotting task, an event-based vision task and a\nsequential pattern recognition task, show that our proposed model achieves\nperformance comparable to existing benchmarks in the SNN literature.

Although both are\nclass-agnostic segmentation tasks that map from RGB space to binary space, the\nformer aims to identify the most salient objects in the image, while the latter\nfocuses on detecting perfectly camouflaged objects that blend into the\nbackground in the image. These two tasks exhibit strong contradictory\nattributes. Previous works have mostly believed that joint learning of these\ntwo tasks would confuse the network, reducing its performance on both tasks.\nHowever, here we present an opposite perspective: with the correct approach to\nlearning, the network can simultaneously possess the capability to find both\nsalient and camouflaged objects, allowing both tasks to benefit from joint\nlearning. We propose SCJoint, a joint learning scheme for SOD and COD tasks,\nassuming that the decoding processes of SOD and COD have different distribution\ncharacteristics. The key to our method is to learn the respective means and\nvariances of the decoding processes for both tasks by inserting a minimal\namount of task-specific learnable parameters within a fully shared network\nstructure, thereby decoupling the contradictory attributes of the two tasks at\na minimal cost. Furthermore, we propose a saliency-based sampling strategy\n(SBSS) to sample the training set of the SOD task to balance the training set\nsizes of the two tasks. In addition, SBSS improves the training set quality and\nshortens the training time.

Their adaptability raises the question of\nwhether knowledge acquired through fine-tuning in a few languages can transfer\nto unseen languages that only appeared during pre-training. To examine this, we\nfine-tune lightweight LLaMA 3.2-3B models on monolingual, bilingual, or\nmultilingual data sets to classify immigration-related tweets from X/Twitter\nacross 13 languages, a domain characterised by polarised, culturally specific\ndiscourse. We evaluate whether minimal language-specific fine-tuning enables\ncross-lingual topic detection and whether adding targeted languages corrects\npre-training biases. Results show that LLMs fine-tuned in one or two languages\ncan reliably classify immigration-related content in unseen languages. However,\nidentifying whether a tweet expresses a pro- or anti-immigration stance\nbenefits from multilingual fine-tuning. Pre-training bias favours dominant\nlanguages, but even minimal exposure to under-represented languages during\nfine-tuning (as little as $9.62\\times10^{-11}$ of the original pre-training\ntoken volume) yields significant gains.

In this work, we introduce Fractional\nClassification Loss (FCL), an adaptive robust loss that automatically\ncalibrates its robustness to label noise during training. Built within the\nactive-passive loss framework, FCL employs the fractional derivative of the\nCross-Entropy (CE) loss as its active component and the Mean Absolute Error\n(MAE) as its passive loss component. With this formulation, we demonstrate that\nthe fractional derivative order $\\mu$ spans a family of loss functions that\ninterpolate between MAE-like robustness and CE-like fast convergence.\nFurthermore, we integrate $\\mu$ into the gradient-based optimization as a\nlearnable parameter and automatically adjust it to optimize the trade-off\nbetween robustness and convergence speed. We reveal that FCL's unique property\nestablishes a critical trade-off that enables the stable learning of $\\mu$:\nlower log penalties on difficult or mislabeled examples improve robustness but\nimpose higher penalties on easy or clean data, reducing model confidence in\nthem. Consequently, FCL can dynamically reshape its loss landscape to achieve\neffective classification performance under label noise.

We propose\na pipeline that generates super-resolved, patient-specific 3D pseudo-healthy\ntarget morphologies from conventional clinical MR scans. First, we compute an\nisotropic super-resolved MR volume using an Implicit Neural Representation\n(INR). Next, we segment femur, tibia, patella, and fibula with a multi-label\ncustom-trained network. Finally, we train a Wavelet Diffusion Model (WDM) to\ngenerate pseudo-healthy target morphologies of the trochlear region. In\ncontrast to prior work producing pseudo-healthy low-resolution 3D MR images,\nour approach enables the generation of sub-millimeter resolved 3D shapes\ncompatible for pre- and intraoperative use.

While several existing methods optimize attention\ncomputation, they still process the full set of hidden states at each layer,\nlimiting overall efficiency. In this work, we propose SlimInfer, an innovative\nframework that aims to accelerate inference by directly pruning less critical\nprompt tokens during the forward pass. Our key insight is an information\ndiffusion phenomenon: As information from critical tokens propagates through\nlayers, it becomes distributed across the entire sequence. This diffusion\nprocess suggests that LLMs can maintain their semantic integrity when excessive\ntokens, even including these critical ones, are pruned in hidden states.\nMotivated by this, SlimInfer introduces a dynamic fine-grained pruning\nmechanism that accurately removes redundant tokens of hidden state at\nintermediate layers. This layer-wise pruning naturally enables an asynchronous\nKV cache manager that prefetches required token blocks without complex\npredictors, reducing both memory usage and I/O costs.

To address this gap, we formalize the\nhaptic captioning task and propose HapticLLaMA, a multimodal sensory language\nmodel that interprets vibration signals into descriptions in a given sensory,\nemotional, or associative category. We investigate two types of haptic\ntokenizers, a frequency-based tokenizer and an EnCodec-based tokenizer, that\nconvert haptic signals into sequences of discrete units, enabling their\nintegration with the LLaMA model. HapticLLaMA is trained in two stages: (1)\nsupervised fine-tuning using the LLaMA architecture with LoRA-based adaptation,\nand (2) fine-tuning via reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). We\nassess HapticLLaMA's captioning performance using both automated n-gram metrics\nand human evaluation. HapticLLaMA demonstrates strong capability in\ninterpreting haptic vibration signals, achieving a METEOR score of 59.98 and a\nBLEU-4 score of 32.06 respectively. Additionally, over 61% of the generated\ncaptions received human ratings above 3.5 on a 7-point scale, with RLHF\nyielding a 10% improvement in the overall rating distribution, indicating\nstronger alignment with human haptic perception.

The potential for intentional deception, where an LLM deliberately\nfabricates or conceals information to serve a hidden objective, remains a\nsignificant and underexplored threat. Existing studies typically induce such\ndeception by explicitly setting a \"hidden\" objective through prompting or\nfine-tuning, which may not fully reflect real-world human-LLM interactions.\nMoving beyond this human-induced deception, we investigate LLMs' self-initiated\ndeception on benign prompts. To address the absence of ground truth in this\nevaluation, we propose a novel framework using \"contact searching questions.\"\nThis framework introduces two statistical metrics derived from psychological\nprinciples to quantify the likelihood of deception. The first, the Deceptive\nIntention Score, measures the model's bias towards a hidden objective. The\nsecond, Deceptive Behavior Score, measures the inconsistency between the LLM's\ninternal belief and its expressed output. Upon evaluating 14 leading LLMs, we\nfind that both metrics escalate as task difficulty increases, rising in\nparallel for most models.

Current mainstream VQA methods typically improve\nperformance by pretraining on large-scale classification datasets (e.g.,\nImageNet, Kinetics-400), followed by fine-tuning on VQA datasets. However, this\nstrategy presents two significant challenges: (1) merely transferring semantic\nknowledge learned from pretraining is insufficient for VQA, as video quality\ndepends on multiple factors (e.g., semantics, distortion, motion, aesthetics);\n(2) pretraining on large-scale datasets demands enormous computational\nresources, often dozens or even hundreds of times greater than training\ndirectly on VQA datasets. Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown\nremarkable generalization capabilities across a wide range of visual tasks, and\nhave begun to demonstrate promising potential in quality assessment. In this\nwork, we propose Q-CLIP, the first fully VLMs-based framework for VQA. Q-CLIP\nenhances both visual and textual representations through a Shared Cross-Modal\nAdapter (SCMA), which contains only a minimal number of trainable parameters\nand is the only component that requires training. This design significantly\nreduces computational cost. In addition, we introduce a set of five learnable\nquality-level prompts to guide the VLMs in perceiving subtle quality\nvariations, thereby further enhancing the model's sensitivity to video quality.\nFurthermore, we investigate the impact of different frame sampling strategies\non VQA performance, and find that frame-difference-based sampling leads to\nbetter generalization performance across datasets.

Extensive experiments on\nfour real-world datasets and three recommendation backbones demonstrate that\nSL@$K$ outperforms existing losses with a notable average improvement of 6.03%.\nThe code is available at https://github.com/Tiny-Snow/IR-Benchmark.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aSoftmaxLoss@K\uff08SL@K\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684NDCG@K\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0cNDCG@K\u662f\u8bc4\u4f30\u63a8\u8350\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u9ec4\u91d1\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u4f18\u5316\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u548cTop-K\u622a\u65ad\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u5ffd\u7565\u622a\u65ad\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u6280\u672f\u5904\u7406Top-K\u622a\u65ad\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e73\u6ed1\u4e0a\u754c\u6765\u4f18\u5316NDCG@K\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86SL@K\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4e09\u4e2a\u63a8\u8350\u9aa8\u5e72\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSL@K\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u5347\u4e866.03%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "SL@K\u5177\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3001\u6613\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u68af\u5ea6\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7b49\u4f18\u70b9\uff0c\u4e3aNDCG@K\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Two LoRA-enhanced LLMs are fine-tuned\nindependently, and their outputs are fused via a lightweight MLP-based decision\nmodule.

However, existing approaches typically model system logs as flat\nevent sequences, thereby failing to capture the inherent frequency dynamics and\nmultiscale disturbance patterns embedded in user behavior. To address these\nlimitations, we propose Log2Sig, a robust anomaly detection framework that\ntransforms user logs into multivariate behavioral frequency signals,\nintroducing a novel representation of user behavior. Log2Sig employs\nMultivariate Variational Mode Decomposition (MVMD) to extract Intrinsic Mode\nFunctions (IMFs), which reveal behavioral fluctuations across multiple temporal\nscales. Based on this, the model further performs joint modeling of behavioral\nsequences and frequency-decomposed signals: the daily behavior sequences are\nencoded using a Mamba-based temporal encoder to capture long-term dependencies,\nwhile the corresponding frequency components are linearly projected to match\nthe encoder's output dimension. These dual-view representations are then fused\nto construct a comprehensive user behavior profile, which is fed into a\nmultilayer perceptron for precise anomaly detection.

However, the frequency of abnormal database access behaviors, such as\ndatabase intrusion by internal and external attacks, continues to rise.\nInternal masqueraders often have greater organizational knowledge, making it\neasier to mimic employee behavior effectively. In contrast, external\nmasqueraders may behave differently due to their lack of familiarity with the\norganization. Current approaches lack the granularity needed to detect\nanomalies at the operational level, frequently misclassifying entire sequences\nof operations as anomalies, even though most operations are likely to represent\nnormal behavior. On the other hand, some anomalous behaviors often resemble\nnormal activities, making them difficult for existing detection methods to\nidentify. This paper introduces a two-tiered anomaly detection approach for\nStructured Query Language (SQL) using the Bidirectional Encoder Representations\nfrom Transformers (BERT) model, specifically DistilBERT, a more efficient,\npre-trained version. Our method combines both unsupervised and supervised\nmachine learning techniques to accurately identify anomalous activities while\nminimizing the need for data labeling. First, the unsupervised method uses\nensemble anomaly detectors that flag embedding vectors distant from learned\nnormal patterns of typical user behavior across the database (out-of-scope\nqueries). Second, the supervised method uses fine-tuned transformer-based\nmodels to detect internal attacks with high precision (in-scope queries), using\nrole-labeled classification, even on limited labeled SQL data.

Timely intervention in\nAD relies heavily on early and precise diagnosis, which remains challenging due\nto the complex and subtle structural changes in the brain. Most existing deep\nlearning methods focus only on a single plane of structural magnetic resonance\nimaging (sMRI) and struggle to accurately capture the complex and nonlinear\nrelationships among pathological regions of the brain, thus limiting their\nability to precisely identify atrophic features. To overcome these limitations,\nwe propose an innovative framework, MPF-KANSC, which integrates multi-plane\nfusion (MPF) for combining features from the coronal, sagittal, and axial\nplanes, and a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network-guided spatial-channel attention\nmechanism (KANSC) to more effectively learn and represent sMRI atrophy\nfeatures. Specifically, the proposed model enables parallel feature extraction\nfrom multiple anatomical planes, thus capturing more comprehensive structural\ninformation. The KANSC attention mechanism further leverages a more flexible\nand accurate nonlinear function approximation technique, facilitating precise\nidentification and localization of disease-related abnormalities.

This paper investigates a critical question for compute-optimal\ndiffusion model deployment: Under a post-training setting without fine-tuning,\nis it more effective to reduce the number of denoising steps or to use a\ncheaper per-step inference? Intuitively, reducing the number of denoising steps\nincreases the variability of the distributions across steps, making the model\nmore sensitive to compression.

Currently, semantic segmentation of pleural\neffusion CT images faces multiple challenges. These include similar gray levels\nbetween effusion and surrounding tissues, blurred edges, and variable\nmorphology. Existing methods often struggle with diverse image variations and\ncomplex edges, primarily because direct feature concatenation causes semantic\ngaps. To address these challenges, we propose the Dual-Branch Interactive\nFusion Attention model (DBIF-AUNet). This model constructs a densely nested\nskip-connection network and innovatively refines the Dual-Domain Feature\nDisentanglement module (DDFD). The DDFD module orthogonally decouples the\nfunctions of dual-domain modules to achieve multi-scale feature complementarity\nand enhance characteristics at different levels. Concurrently, we design a\nBranch Interaction Attention Fusion module (BIAF) that works synergistically\nwith the DDFD. This module dynamically weights and fuses global, local, and\nfrequency band features, thereby improving segmentation robustness.\nFurthermore, we implement a nested deep supervision mechanism with hierarchical\nadaptive hybrid loss to effectively address class imbalance.

To overcome this limitation,\nwe propose AnomalyMoE, a novel and universal anomaly detection framework based\non a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture.

This hierarchical design allows a single model to concurrently\nunderstand and detect a wide spectrum of anomalies.

Feature selection has\nbeen widely applied to address these challenges. However, previous studies\ngenerally assumed that multi-modal physiological data are complete, whereas in\nreality, the data are often incomplete due to the openness of the acquisition\nand operational environment. For example, a part of samples are available in\nseveral modalities but not in others. To address this issue, we propose a novel\nmethod for incomplete multi-modal physiological signal feature selection called\nadaptive shared latent structure learning (ASLSL).

Under the\nWeakly-Supervised VAD (WSVAD) paradigm, only video-level labels are provided\nduring training, while predictions are made at the frame level. Although\nstate-of-the-art models perform well on simple anomalies (e.g., explosions),\nthey struggle with complex real-world events (e.g., shoplifting). This\ndifficulty stems from two key issues: (1) the inability of current models to\naddress the diversity of anomaly types, as they process all categories with a\nshared model, overlooking category-specific features; and (2) the weak\nsupervision signal, which lacks precise temporal information, limiting the\nability to capture nuanced anomalous patterns blended with normal events. To\naddress these challenges, we propose Gaussian Splatting-guided Mixture of\nExperts (GS-MoE), a novel framework that employs a set of expert models, each\nspecialized in capturing specific anomaly types. These experts are guided by a\ntemporal Gaussian splatting loss, enabling the model to leverage temporal\nconsistency and enhance weak supervision. The Gaussian splatting approach\nencourages a more precise and comprehensive representation of anomalies by\nfocusing on temporal segments most likely to contain abnormal events.

We assess the utility of our generative approach in\nmulti-centre cardiac MR segmentation, using the 2D nnU-Net, 3D nnU-Net and\nvanilla U-Net segmentation networks. We explore domain generalisation, where,\ndomain-invariant segmentation models are trained on synthetic source domain\ndata, and domain adaptation, where, we shift target domain data towards the\nsource domain using the DM.

We hypothesize that street view imagery --\nan inexpensive data source with global coverage -- contains latent social\ninformation that can be extracted and interpreted through established social\nscience theory. As a proof of concept, we analyzed 2,998 street view images\nfrom 15 cities using a multimodal large language model guided by Mehta's\ntaxonomy of passive, fleeting, and enduring sociability -- one illustrative\nexample of a theory grounded in urban design that could be substituted or\ncomplemented by other sociological frameworks. We then used linear regression\nmodels, controlling for factors like weather, time of day, and pedestrian\ncounts, to test whether the inferred sociability measures correlate with\ncity-level place attachment scores from the World Values Survey and with\nenvironmental predictors (e.g., green, sky, and water view indices) derived\nfrom individual street view images.

To address this gap, our paper\nintroduces a novel objective: enterprise-oriented privacy concerns. Achieving\nthis objective requires overcoming two fundamental challenges: existing methods\nsuch as data sanitization severely degrade model performance, and the field\nlacks public datasets for evaluation. We address these challenges with several\nsolutions. (1) To prevent performance degradation, we propose ABack, a\ntraining-free mechanism that leverages a Hidden State Model to pinpoint the\norigin of a leakage intention and rewrite the output safely. (2) To solve the\nlack of datasets, we construct PriGenQA, a new benchmark for enterprise privacy\nscenarios in healthcare and finance. To ensure a rigorous evaluation, we move\nbeyond simple static attacks by developing a powerful adaptive attacker with\nGroup Relative Policy Optimization.

However, because short text\nrepresentations have limited expressiveness, conventional methods struggle to\nidentify cluster centers that truly capture each category's underlying\nsemantics, causing the representations to be optimized in suboptimal\ndirections. To address this issue, we propose IOCC, a novel few-shot\ncontrastive learning method that achieves alignment between the cluster centers\nand the semantic centers. IOCC consists of two key modules:\nInteraction-enhanced Optimal Transport (IEOT) and Center-aware Contrastive\nLearning (CACL). Specifically, IEOT incorporates semantic interactions between\nindividual samples into the conventional optimal transport problem, and\ngenerate pseudo-labels. Based on these pseudo-labels, we aggregate\nhigh-confidence samples to construct pseudo-centers that approximate the\nsemantic centers. Next, CACL optimizes text representations toward their\ncorresponding pseudo-centers. As training progresses, the collaboration between\nthe two modules gradually reduces the gap between cluster centers and semantic\ncenters.

This paper introduces a\nnovel GAN-based semi-supervised learning framework specifically designed for\nlow labeled-data regimes, evaluated across settings with 5 to 50 labeled\nsamples per class. Our approach integrates three specialized neural networks --\na generator for class-conditioned image translation, a discriminator for\nauthenticity assessment and classification, and a dedicated classifier --\nwithin a three-phase training framework. The method alternates between\nsupervised training on limited labeled data and unsupervised learning that\nleverages abundant unlabeled images through image-to-image translation rather\nthan generation from noise. We employ ensemble-based pseudo-labeling that\ncombines confidence-weighted predictions from the discriminator and classifier\nwith temporal consistency through exponential moving averaging, enabling\nreliable label estimation for unlabeled data. Comprehensive evaluation across\neleven MedMNIST datasets demonstrates that our approach achieves statistically\nsignificant improvements over six state-of-the-art GAN-based semi-supervised\nmethods, with particularly strong performance in the extreme 5-shot setting\nwhere the scarcity of labeled data is most challenging.

Prior\nworks showed that the language modality can help in the adaptation process,\nexhibiting more robustness to such complex shifts. In this paper, we introduce\nTRUST, a novel UDA approach that exploits the robustness of the language\nmodality to guide the adaptation of a vision model. TRUST generates\npseudo-labels for target samples from their captions and introduces a novel\nuncertainty estimation strategy that uses normalised CLIP similarity scores to\nestimate the uncertainty of the generated pseudo-labels. Such estimated\nuncertainty is then used to reweight the classification loss, mitigating the\nadverse effects of wrong pseudo-labels obtained from low-quality captions. To\nfurther increase the robustness of the vision model, we propose a multimodal\nsoft-contrastive learning loss that aligns the vision and language feature\nspaces, by leveraging captions to guide the contrastive training of the vision\nmodel on target images. In our contrastive loss, each pair of images acts as\nboth a positive and a negative pair and their feature representations are\nattracted and repulsed with a strength proportional to the similarity of their\ncaptions. This solution avoids the need for hardly determining positive and\nnegative pairs, which is critical in the UDA setting.

Land Surface\nTemperature (LST) is a key variable in this context and is retrieved from\nremote sensing satellites. However, these systems face a trade-off between\nspatial and temporal resolution. While spatio-temporal fusion methods offer\npromising solutions, few have addressed the estimation of daily LST at 10 m\nresolution. In this study, we present WGAST, a Weakly-Supervised Generative\nNetwork for Daily 10 m LST Estimation via Spatio-Temporal Fusion of Terra\nMODIS, Landsat 8, and Sentinel-2. WGAST is the first end-to-end deep learning\nframework designed for this task. It adopts a conditional generative\nadversarial architecture, with a generator composed of four stages: feature\nextraction, fusion, LST reconstruction, and noise suppression. The first stage\nemploys a set of encoders to extract multi-level latent representations from\nthe inputs, which are then fused in the second stage using cosine similarity,\nnormalization, and temporal attention mechanisms. The third stage decodes the\nfused features into high-resolution LST, followed by a Gaussian filter to\nsuppress high-frequency noise. Training follows a weakly supervised strategy\nbased on physical averaging principles and reinforced by a PatchGAN\ndiscriminator. Experiments demonstrate that WGAST outperforms existing methods\nin both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Compared to the\nbest-performing baseline, on average, WGAST reduces RMSE by 17.18% and improves\nSSIM by 11.00%. Furthermore, WGAST is robust to cloud-induced LST and\neffectively captures fine-scale thermal patterns, as validated against 33\nground-based sensors.

First, we characterize these risks across seven key\ndimensions, namely intent, competency, entity, polarity, linearity, reach, and\norder.

While we primarily focus on\nrealistic, production-like evaluation, in our preliminarily study we find that\ncommon academic benchmarks show eSASRec to be 23% more effective compared to\nthe most recent state-of-the-art models, such as ActionPiece.

In the latter,\ncurrent assessment methods heavily depend on operator expertise, and the high\nheterogeneity of lesions complicates diagnosis, with biopsy persisting as the\ngold standard despite its substantial costs and risks. A critical bottleneck\nfor specialized endoscopic CADx/e systems is the lack of well-annotated\ndatasets with sufficient variability for real-world generalization. This study\nintroduces a novel approach that exploits a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM)\ncoupled with a ControlNet adapter to generate laryngeal endoscopic\nimage-annotation pairs, guided by clinical observations. The method addresses\ndata scarcity by conditioning the diffusion process to produce realistic,\nhigh-quality, and clinically relevant image features that capture diverse\nanatomical conditions. The proposed approach can be leveraged to expand\ntraining datasets for CADx/e models, empowering the assessment process in\nlaryngology. Indeed, during a downstream task of detection, the addition of\nonly 10% synthetic data improved the detection rate of laryngeal lesions by 9%\nwhen the model was internally tested and 22.1% on out-of-domain external data.\nAdditionally, the realism of the generated images was evaluated by asking 5\nexpert otorhinolaryngologists with varying expertise to rate their confidence\nin distinguishing synthetic from real images.

Weighted model\ncounting finds applications across a variety of domains including probabilistic\nreasoning and quantitative risk assessment.\n  Most weighted model counting programs operate by (explicitly or implicitly)\nconverting the input formula into a form that enables arithmetic evaluation,\nusing multiplication for conjunctions and addition for disjunctions. Performing\nthis evaluation using floating-point arithmetic can yield inaccurate results,\nand it cannot quantify the level of precision achieved. Computing with rational\narithmetic gives exact results, but it is costly in both time and space.\n  This paper describes how to combine multiple numeric representations to\nefficiently compute weighted model counts that are guaranteed to achieve a\nuser-specified precision. When all weights are nonnegative, we prove that the\nprecision loss of arithmetic evaluation using floating-point arithmetic can be\ntightly bounded. We show that supplementing a standard IEEE double-precision\nrepresentation with a separate 64-bit exponent, a format we call extended-range\ndouble (ERD), avoids the underflow and overflow issues commonly encountered in\nweighted model counting. For problems with mixed negative and positive weights,\nwe show that a combination of interval floating-point arithmetic and rational\narithmetic can achieve the twin goals of efficiency and guaranteed precision.\nFor our evaluations, we have devised especially challenging formulas and weight\nassignments, demonstrating the robustness of our approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u6570\u503c\u8868\u793a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u52a0\u6743\u6a21\u578b\u8ba1\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7528\u6237\u6307\u5b9a\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5c55\u8303\u56f4\u53cc\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff08ERD\uff09\u548c\u533a\u95f4\u6d6e\u70b9\u7b97\u672f\u4e0e\u6709\u7406\u7b97\u672f\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u52a0\u6743\u6a21\u578b\u8ba1\u6570\u5728\u6982\u7387\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5b9a\u91cf\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u6d6e\u70b9\u7b97\u672f\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\uff0c\u800c\u6709\u7406\u7b97\u672f\u5219\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u6269\u5c55\u8303\u56f4\u53cc\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff08ERD\uff09\u548c\u533a\u95f4\u6d6e\u70b9\u7b97\u672f\u4e0e\u6709\u7406\u7b97\u672f\uff0c\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u52a0\u6743\u6a21\u578b\u8ba1\u6570\u5e76\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u516c\u5f0f\u548c\u6743\u91cd\u5206\u914d\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u907f\u514d\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6ea2\u51fa\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u635f\u5931\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u6570\u503c\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u7cbe\u5ea6\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u52a0\u6743\u6a21\u578b\u8ba1\u6570\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

In view of this, it is\nnatural to seek approximate allocations that guarantee each agent a connected\nbundle of goods with value at least a constant fraction of the maximin share\nvalue to the agent. It is known that for some classes of graphs, such as\ncomplete graphs, cycles, and $d$-claw-free graphs for any fixed $d$, such\napproximate allocations indeed exist. However, it is an open problem whether\nthey exist for the class of all graphs.\n  In this paper, we continue the systematic study of the existence of\napproximate allocations on restricted graph classes.

From the outset,\nNCA-grown organisms have had issues with stability, their natural boundary\noften breaking down and exhibiting tumour-like growth or failing to maintain\nthe expected shape. In this paper, we present a method for improving the\nstability of NCA-grown organisms by introducing an 'identity' layer with simple\nconstraints during training.\n  Results show that NCAs grown in close proximity are more stable compared with\nthe original NCA model. Moreover, only a single identity value is required to\nachieve this increase in stability.

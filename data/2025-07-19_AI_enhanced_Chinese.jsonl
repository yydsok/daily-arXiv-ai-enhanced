However,\nexisting 3DGS approaches usually generate plausible outputs and face\nsignificant challenges in complex scene reconstruction, manifesting as\nincomplete holistic structural outlines and unclear local lighting effects. To\naddress these issues simultaneously, we propose a novel decoupled optimization\nframework, which integrates wavelet decomposition into 3D Gaussian Splatting\nand 2D sampling. Technically, through 3D wavelet decomposition, our approach\ndivides point clouds into high-frequency and low-frequency components, enabling\ntargeted optimization for each. The low-frequency component captures global\nstructural outlines and manages the distribution of Gaussians through\nvoxelization.

In order to reliably accomplish these\ntasks, LMs must be able to discern the modal category of a sentence (i.e.,\nwhether it describes something that is possible, impossible, completely\nnonsensical, etc.). However, recent studies have called into question the\nability of LMs to categorize sentences according to modality (Michaelov et al.,\n2025; Kauf et al., 2023). In this work, we identify linear representations that\ndiscriminate between modal categories within a variety of LMs, or modal\ndifference vectors. Analysis of modal difference vectors reveals that LMs have\naccess to more reliable modal categorization judgments than previously\nreported. Furthermore, we find that modal difference vectors emerge in a\nconsistent order as models become more competent (i.e., through training steps,\nlayers, and parameter count). Notably, we find that modal difference vectors\nidentified within LM activations can be used to model fine-grained human\ncategorization behavior. This potentially provides a novel view into how human\nparticipants distinguish between modal categories, which we explore by\ncorrelating projections along modal difference vectors with human participants'\nratings of interpretable features.

To address these\nchallenges, our key idea is to embed a new visual parameter space into a\npre-trained LLM, enabling stable learning of visual knowledge from noisy data\nvia delta tuning. Based on this principle, we first introduce Mono-InternVL, an\nadvanced monolithic MLLM that incorporates a set of visual experts through a\nmultimodal mixture-of-experts architecture. In addition, we design an\ninnovative Endogenous Visual Pre-training (EViP) for Mono-InternVL to maximize\nits visual capabilities via progressive learning. Mono-InternVL achieves\ncompetitive performance against existing MLLMs but also leads to relatively\nexpensive data cost. Therefore, we further present Mono-InternVL-1.5, a cheaper\nand stronger monolithic MLLM equipped with an improved EViP (EViP++). EViP++\nintroduces additional visual attention experts to Mono-InternVL-1.5 and\nre-organizes the pre-training process in an efficient manner. During inference,\nit includes a fused CUDA kernel to speed up its MoE operations. With these\ndesigns, Mono-InternVL-1.5 significantly reduces training and inference costs,\nwhile still maintaining competitive performance with Mono-InternVL. To evaluate\nour approach, we conduct extensive experiments across 15 benchmarks. Results\ndemonstrate that Mono-InternVL outperforms existing monolithic MLLMs on 12 out\nof 15 benchmarks, e.g., +114-point improvement over Emu3 on OCRBench. Compared\nto its modular counterpart, i.e., InternVL-1.5, Mono-InternVL-1.5 achieves\nsimilar multimodal performance while reducing first-token latency by up to 69%.\nCode and models are released at https://github.com/OpenGVLab/Mono-InternVL.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7684\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLM\uff09Mono-InternVL\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5d4c\u5165\u89c6\u89c9\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff08EViP\uff09\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u7684Mono-InternVL-1.5\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5355\u6a21\u6001MLLM\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5b66\u4e60\u89c6\u89c9\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMono-InternVL\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\u5d4c\u5165\u89c6\u89c9\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1EViP\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u4e3aMono-InternVL-1.5\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u89c6\u89c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e13\u5bb6\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u7684EViP++\u3002", "result": "Mono-InternVL\u572815\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\uff0cMono-InternVL-1.5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5355\u6a21\u6001MLLM\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6210\u672c\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u5e73\u8861\u3002"}}

Preprint", "summary": "Crop mapping involves identifying and classifying crop types using spatial\ndata, primarily derived from remote sensing imagery. This study presents the\nfirst comprehensive review of large-scale, pixel-wise crop mapping workflows,\nencompassing both conventional supervised methods and emerging transfer\nlearning approaches. To identify the optimal supervised crop mapping workflows,\nwe conducted systematic experiments, comparing six widely adopted satellite\nimage-based preprocessing methods, alongside eleven supervised pixel-wise\nclassification models. Additionally, we assessed the synergistic impact of\nvaried training sample sizes and variable combinations. Moreover, we identified\noptimal transfer learning techniques for different magnitudes of domain shift.\nThe evaluation of best methods was conducted across five diverse agricultural\nsites. Landsat 8 served as the primary satellite data source. Labels come from\nCDL trusted pixels and field surveys.\n  Our findings reveal three key insights. First, fine-scale interval\npreprocessing paired with Transformer models consistently delivered optimal\nperformance for both supervised and transferable workflows. RF offered rapid\ntraining and competitive performance in conventional supervised learning and\ndirect transfer to similar domains. Second, transfer learning techniques\nenhanced workflow adaptability, with UDA being effective for homogeneous crop\nclasses while fine-tuning remains robust across diverse scenarios.

DS methods, due to the ensemble being instance-based, seem to be an\nefficient choice under drifting scenarios. However, some attention must be paid\nto adapting such methods for concept drift.

Traditional physics-based stability metrics,\nsuch as Static Stability Margin (SSM) or Zero Moment Point (ZMP) require\nknowledge of contact forces, terrain geometry, and the robot's precise\ncenter-of-mass that are difficult to measure accurately in real-world field\nconditions. In this work, we propose a learning-based approach to estimate\nrobot platform stability directly from proprioceptive data using a lightweight\nneural network, IMUnet. Our method enables data-driven inference of robot\nstability without requiring an explicit terrain model or force sensing.\n  We also develop a novel vision-based ArUco tracking method to compute a\nscalar score to quantify robot platform stability called C3 score. The score\ncaptures image-space perturbations over time as a proxy for physical\ninstability and is used as a training signal for the neural network based\nmodel. As a pilot study, we evaluate our approach on data collected across\nmultiple terrain types and speeds and demonstrate generalization to previously\nunseen conditions.

Since there\ncould be an exponential number of object-action combinations, labeled data is\nlimited - leading to a long-tail distribution problem. Recently, zero-shot\nlearning emerged as a solution, with end-to-end transformer-based object\ndetectors adapted for HOID becoming successful frameworks. However, their\nprimary focus is designing improved decoders for learning entangled or\ndisentangled interpretations of interactions. We advocate that HOI-specific\ncues must be anticipated at the encoder stage itself to obtain a stronger scene\ninterpretation. Consequently, we build a top-down framework named Funnel-HOI\ninspired by the human tendency to grasp well-defined concepts first and then\nassociate them with abstract concepts during scene understanding. We first\nprobe an image for the presence of objects (well-defined concepts) and then\nprobe for actions (abstract concepts) associated with them. A novel asymmetric\nco-attention mechanism mines these cues utilizing multimodal information\n(incorporating zero-shot capabilities) and yields stronger interaction\nrepresentations at the encoder level. Furthermore, a novel loss is devised that\nconsiders objectaction relatedness and regulates misclassification penalty\nbetter than existing loss functions for guiding the interaction classifier.\nExtensive experiments on the HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets across\nfully-supervised and six zero-shot settings reveal our state-of-the-art\nperformance, with up to 12.4% and 8.4% gains for unseen and rare HOI\ncategories, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aFunnel-HOI\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u9636\u6bb5\u5f15\u5165HOI\u7279\u5b9a\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u5171\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u548c\u65b0\u578b\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4eba-\u7269\u4ea4\u4e92\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u4eba-\u7269\u4ea4\u4e92\u7ec4\u5408\u6570\u91cf\u5e9e\u5927\uff0c\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u5bfc\u81f4\u957f\u5c3e\u5206\u5e03\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u800c\u4f5c\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5e94\u5728\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u9636\u6bb5\u5f15\u5165HOI\u7279\u5b9a\u7ebf\u7d22\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFunnel-HOI\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5148\u68c0\u6d4b\u7269\u4f53\uff08\u660e\u786e\u6982\u5ff5\uff09\uff0c\u518d\u5173\u8054\u52a8\u4f5c\uff08\u62bd\u8c61\u6982\u5ff5\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u5171\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u6316\u6398\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b0\u578b\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5728HICO-DET\u548cV-COCO\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u5168\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u672a\u89c1\u548c\u7f55\u89c1HOI\u7c7b\u522b\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u534712.4%\u548c8.4%\u3002", "conclusion": "Funnel-HOI\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u9636\u6bb5\u5f15\u5165HOI\u7279\u5b9a\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4ea4\u4e92\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002"}}

We argue that this\nprofound adaptability is fundamentally linked to the efficient construction and\nrefinement of internal representations of the environment, commonly referred to\nas world models, and we refer to this adaptation mechanism as world model\ninduction. However, current understanding and evaluation of world models in\nartificial intelligence (AI) remains narrow, often focusing on static\nrepresentations learned from training on a massive corpora of data, instead of\nthe efficiency and efficacy of models in learning these representations through\ninteraction and exploration within a novel environment. In this Perspective, we\nprovide a view of world model induction drawing on decades of research in\ncognitive science on how humans learn and adapt so efficiently; we then call\nfor a new evaluation framework for assessing adaptive world models in AI.\nConcretely, we propose a new benchmarking paradigm based on suites of carefully\ndesigned games with genuine, deep and continually refreshing novelty in the\nunderlying game structures -- we refer to this kind of games as novel games. We\ndetail key desiderata for constructing these games and propose appropriate\nmetrics to explicitly challenge and evaluate the agent's ability for rapid\nworld model induction.

Making these decisions reliant on human\njudgement is both counter-productive to the aim of exploring very large number\nof scenarios in a timely manner and infeasible when considering the workload\nneeded to involve humans in each of these choices. In this paper, we move human\njudgement outside the simulation decision cycle. Basically, the human will\ndesign the ethical metric space, leaving it to the simulated environment to\nexplore the space. When the simulation completes its testing cycles, the\ntesting environment will come back to the human commander with a few options to\nselect from. The human commander will then exercise human-judgement to select\nthe most appropriate course of action, which will then get executed\naccordingly. We assume that the problem of designing metrics that are\nsufficiently granular to assess the ethical implications of decisions is\nsolved. Subsequently, the fundamental problem we look at in this paper is how\nto weight ethical decisions during the running of these simulations; that is,\nhow to dynamically weight the ethical attributes when agents are faced with\ndecision options with ethical implications during generative simulations. The\nmulti-criteria decision making literature has started to look at nearby\nproblems, where the concept of entropy has been used to determine the weights\nduring aggregation.

Previous studies have generally not integrated retinal\nmicrovasculature characteristics with comprehensive serum lipidomic profiles as\npotential indicators of CVD risk. In this study, an innovative imaging omics\nframework was introduced, combining retinal microvascular traits derived\nthrough deep learning based image processing with serum lipidomic data to\nhighlight asymptomatic biomarkers of cardiovascular risk beyond the\nconventional lipid panel. This represents the first large scale, covariate\nadjusted and stratified correlation analysis conducted in a healthy population,\nwhich is essential for identifying early indicators of disease. Retinal\nphenotypes were quantified using automated image analysis tools, while serum\nlipid profiling was performed by Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatography\nElectrospray ionization High resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC ESI HRMS).\nStrong, age- and sex-independent correlations were established, particularly\nbetween average artery width, vessel density, and lipid subclasses such as\ntriacylglycerols (TAGs), diacylglycerols (DAGs), and ceramides (Cers). These\nassociations suggest a converging mechanism of microvascular remodeling under\nmetabolic stress.

In this paper, we propose a novel visual\nand repeat robotic autonomous navigation method that requires no accurate\nlocalization and dense reconstruction modules, which makes our system featured\nby lightweight and robustness. Firstly, feature flow is introduced and we\ndevelop a qualitative mapping between feature flow and robot's motion, in which\nfeature flow is defined as pixel location bias between matched features. Based\non the mapping model, the map outputted by the teaching phase is represented as\na keyframe graph, in which the feature flow on the edge encodes the relative\nmotion between adjacent keyframes. Secondly, the visual repeating navigation is\nessentially modeled as a feature flow minimization problem between current\nobservation and the map keyframe. To drive the robot to consistently reduce the\nfeature flow between current frame and map keyframes without accurate\nlocalization, a probabilistic motion planning is developed based on our\nqualitative feature flow-motion mapping indicator.

Prior research has focused on runtime performance: improving training\nefficiency and stability.

Startup overhead is particularly important in large,\nindustrial-scale LLMs, where failures occur more frequently and multiple teams\noperate in iterative update-debug cycles.

To mitigate these bottlenecks, Bootseer introduces three\ntechniques: (a) hot block record-and-prefetch, (b) dependency snapshotting, and\n(c) striped HDFS-FUSE.

This paper studies the problem of Long-term Active Embodied\nQuestion Answering (LA-EQA), a new task in which a robot must both recall past\nexperiences and actively explore its environment to answer complex,\ntemporally-grounded questions. Unlike traditional EQA settings, which typically\nfocus either on understanding the present environment alone or on recalling a\nsingle past observation, LA-EQA challenges an agent to reason over past,\npresent, and possible future states, deciding when to explore, when to consult\nits memory, and when to stop gathering observations and provide a final answer.\nStandard EQA approaches based on large models struggle in this setting due to\nlimited context windows, absence of persistent memory, and an inability to\ncombine memory recall with active exploration. To address this, we propose a\nstructured memory system for robots, inspired by the mind palace method from\ncognitive science. Our method encodes episodic experiences as scene-graph-based\nworld instances, forming a reasoning and planning algorithm that enables\ntargeted memory retrieval and guided navigation. To balance the\nexploration-recall trade-off, we introduce value-of-information-based stopping\ncriteria that determines when the agent has gathered sufficient information.

However, these gains often persist\neven when models are trained with flawed signals, such as random or inverted\nrewards, raising a fundamental question: do such improvements reflect true\nreasoning, or are they merely artifacts of overfitting to benchmark-specific\npatterns? To address this question, we take an evaluation-centric perspective\nand identify two critical shortcomings in existing protocols. First,\n\\emph{benchmark contamination} arises from the public availability of test\nproblems, increasing the risk of data leakage. Second, \\emph{evaluation\nfragility} stems from the reliance on single-instance assessments, which are\nhighly sensitive to stochastic outputs and fail to capture reasoning\nconsistency. To overcome these limitations, we introduce {VAR-MATH}, a symbolic\nevaluation framework designed to probe genuine reasoning ability. By converting\nfixed numerical problems into symbolic templates and requiring models to solve\nmultiple instantiations of each, VAR-MATH enforces consistent reasoning across\nstructurally equivalent variants, thereby mitigating contamination and\nimproving evaluation robustness. We apply VAR-MATH to transform two popular\nbenchmarks, AMC23 and AIME24, into their symbolic counterparts, VAR-AMC23 and\nVAR-AIME24. Experimental results reveal substantial performance drops for\nRL-trained models on the variabilized versions, especially for smaller models,\nwith average declines of 48.0\\% on AMC23 and 58.3\\% on AIME24. These findings\nsuggest that many existing RL methods rely on superficial heuristics and fail\nto generalize beyond specific numerical forms. Overall, VAR-MATH offers a\nprincipled, contamination-resistant evaluation paradigm for mathematical\nreasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faVAR-MATH\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b26\u53f7\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u63ed\u793aRL\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u662f\u5426\u771f\u5b9e\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709RL\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4e0a\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u80fd\u4ec5\u662f\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u771f\u5b9e\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9700\u66f4\u4e25\u8c28\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165VAR-MATH\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u56fa\u5b9a\u6570\u503c\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u4e3a\u7b26\u53f7\u6a21\u677f\uff0c\u8981\u6c42\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4ee5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "RL\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7b26\u53f7\u5316\u7248\u672c\uff08VAR-AMC23\u548cVAR-AIME24\uff09\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u4f9d\u8d56\u8868\u9762\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "VAR-MATH\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6297\u6c61\u67d3\u3001\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u8bc4\u4f30\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Recent studies have\nsuccessfully applied diffusion models to motion planning, demonstrating their\ncompetence in handling complex scenarios and accurately predicting multi-modal\nfuture trajectories. Despite their effectiveness, diffusion models have\nlimitations in training objectives, as they approximate data distributions\nrather than explicitly capturing the underlying decision-making dynamics.\nHowever, the crux of motion planning lies in non-differentiable downstream\nobjectives, such as safety (collision avoidance) and effectiveness\n(goal-reaching), which conventional learning algorithms cannot directly\noptimize. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning-based training\nscheme for diffusion motion planning models, enabling them to effectively learn\nnon-differentiable objectives that explicitly measure safety and effectiveness.\nSpecifically, we introduce a reward-weighted dynamic thresholding algorithm to\nshape a dense reward signal, facilitating more effective training and\noutperforming models trained with differentiable objectives.

In\nthis position paper, we present a novel framework that integrates camera noise\nfactor identification with situation coverage analysis to systematically elicit\nrobustness-related safety requirements for AI-based perception systems. We\nfocus specifically on camera degradation in the automotive domain. Building on\nan existing framework for identifying degradation modes, we propose involving\ndomain, sensor, and safety experts, and incorporating Operational Design Domain\nspecifications to extend the degradation model by incorporating noise factors\nrelevant to AI performance. Situation coverage analysis is then applied to\nidentify representative operational contexts. This work marks an initial step\ntoward integrating noise factor analysis and situational coverage to support\nprincipled formulation and completeness assessment of robustness requirements\nfor camera-based AI perception.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u76f8\u673a\u566a\u58f0\u56e0\u7d20\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u60c5\u5883\u8986\u76d6\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4ee5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u5730\u63d0\u53d6\u57fa\u4e8eAI\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5b89\u5168\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9488\u5bf9\u6c7d\u8f66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u76f8\u673a\u9000\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "AI\u611f\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f9d\u8d56\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6027\u80fd\u9000\u5316\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u548cAI\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5168\u9762\u8986\u76d6\u6240\u6709\u9000\u5316\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b89\u5168\u9700\u6c42\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u9886\u57df\u3001\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u4e13\u5bb6\u610f\u89c1\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u9000\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7eb3\u5165\u5f71\u54cdAI\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u60c5\u5883\u8986\u76d6\u5206\u6790\u8bc6\u522b\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u64cd\u4f5c\u73af\u5883\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u5236\u5b9a\u548c\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9488\u5bf9\u76f8\u673a\u9000\u5316\u7684AI\u611f\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u76f8\u673a\u9000\u5316\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684AI\u611f\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u9700\u6c42\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u521d\u6b65\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

For the first time, we systematically evaluate several\nego-centric VLN methods in physical robotic settings across different technical\npipelines, including classification models for single-step discrete action\nprediction, a diffusion model for dense waypoint prediction, and a train-free,\nmap-based large language model (LLM) integrated with path planning.

The most common is the use of automated\nbenchmarks in which LLMs have to answer multiple-choice questions of different\ntopics. However, this method has certain limitations, being the most\nconcerning, the poor correlation with the humans. An alternative approach, is\nto have humans evaluate the LLMs. This poses scalability issues as there is a\nlarge and growing number of models to evaluate making it impractical (and\ncostly) to run traditional studies based on recruiting a number of evaluators\nand having them rank the responses of the models. An alternative approach is\nthe use of public arenas, such as the popular LM arena, on which any user can\nfreely evaluate models on any question and rank the responses of two models.\nThe results are then elaborated into a model ranking. An increasingly important\naspect of LLMs is their energy consumption and, therefore, evaluating how\nenergy awareness influences the decisions of humans in selecting a model is of\ninterest. In this paper, we present GEA, the Generative Energy Arena, an arena\nthat incorporates information on the energy consumption of the model in the\nevaluation process. Preliminary results obtained with GEA are also presented,\nshowing that for most questions, when users are aware of the energy\nconsumption, they favor smaller and more energy efficient models. This suggests\nthat for most user interactions, the extra cost and energy incurred by the more\ncomplex and top-performing models do not provide an increase in the perceived\nquality of the responses that justifies their use.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aGEA\uff08Generative Energy Arena\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u8017\u4fe1\u606f\u7eb3\u5165\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u80fd\u8017\u610f\u8bc6\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u7528\u6237\u5bf9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u3002\u521d\u6b65\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u9009\u62e9\u66f4\u5c0f\u3001\u66f4\u8282\u80fd\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5982\u81ea\u52a8\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4ef7\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4f4e\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u53c8\u56e0\u6a21\u578b\u6570\u91cf\u5e9e\u5927\u800c\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u8017\u95ee\u9898\u65e5\u76ca\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u7eb3\u5165\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f53\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGEA\uff08Generative Energy Arena\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u516c\u5f00\u7ade\u6280\u573a\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u8017\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u8ba9\u7528\u6237\u5728\u9009\u62e9\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u80fd\u8017\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "result": "\u521d\u6b65\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5927\u591a\u6570\u7528\u6237\u5728\u4e86\u89e3\u80fd\u8017\u4fe1\u606f\u540e\uff0c\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u9009\u62e9\u66f4\u8282\u80fd\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u6027\u80fd\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5927\u591a\u6570\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u989d\u5916\u6210\u672c\u548c\u80fd\u8017\u5e76\u672a\u5e26\u6765\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u66f4\u8282\u80fd\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u66f4\u53d7\u6b22\u8fce\u3002"}}

This not only affects the control performance, but\nalso increases the difficulty of designing MPC cost functions that reflect the\ndesired long-term objective. This paper proposes ZipMPC, a method that imitates\na long-horizon MPC behaviour by learning a compressed and context-dependent\ncost function for a short-horizon MPC. It improves performance over alternative\nmethods, such as approximate explicit MPC and automatic cost parameter tuning,\nin particular in terms of i) optimizing the long term objective; ii)\nmaintaining computational costs comparable to a short-horizon MPC; iii)\nensuring constraint satisfaction; and iv) generalizing control behaviour to\nenvironments not observed during training. For this purpose, ZipMPC leverages\nthe concept of differentiable MPC with neural networks to propagate gradients\nof the imitation loss through the MPC optimization. We validate our proposed\nmethod in simulation and real-world experiments on autonomous racing.

These findings demonstrate that outcome-only metrics are\ninsufficient for evaluating multi-agent performance and highlight the\nimportance of process-level diagnostics in designing more interpretable and\nresource-efficient collaborative AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faGEMMAS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5f15\u5165IDS\u548cUPR\u6307\u6807\u8861\u91cf\u534f\u4f5c\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u7ed3\u679c\u6307\u6807\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u6700\u7ec8\u8f93\u51fa\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u4f4e\u6548\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u534f\u8c03\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGEMMAS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u6709\u5411\u65e0\u73af\u56fe\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165IDS\u548cUPR\u4e24\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7ea7\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5728GSM8K\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ec5\u5dee2.1%\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728IDS\u548cUPR\u4e0a\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u534f\u4f5c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5b58\u5728\u5de8\u5927\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ed3\u679c\u6307\u6807\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7ea7\u8bca\u65ad\u5bf9\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9ad8\u6548\u534f\u4f5cAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

Recent token merging methods\nimprove efficiency by reducing the number of tokens during attention\noperations, but often overlook the characteristics of attention-based image\ngeneration models, limiting their effectiveness. In this paper, we propose\nlocal representative token guided merging (ReToM), a novel token merging\nstrategy applicable to any attention mechanism in image generation. To merge\ntokens based on various contextual information, ReToM defines local boundaries\nas windows within attention inputs and adjusts window sizes.

This approach preserves the most\nsalient local features while minimizing computational overhead.

However, existing\napproaches often struggle to provide accurate and robust quality scores,\nlimiting their applicability in practical scenarios. With the rapid progress in\nMulti-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), recent MLLM-based methods have\nachieved remarkable performance in image quality assessment. In this work, we\nextend this success to the document domain by adapting DeQA-Score, a\nstate-of-the-art MLLM-based image quality scorer, for document quality\nassessment. We propose DeQA-Doc, a framework that leverages the visual language\ncapabilities of MLLMs and a soft label strategy to regress continuous document\nquality scores. To adapt DeQA-Score to DeQA-Doc, we adopt two complementary\nsolutions to construct soft labels without the variance information.

Existing DCT methods\nmainly measure discrepancies between a distribution pair defined on discrete\none-dimensional spaces (e.g., using total variation), which limits their\napplications to complex data (e.g., images). To extend DCT to more types of\ndata, a natural idea is to introduce maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), a powerful\nmeasurement of the distributional discrepancy between two complex\ndistributions, into DCT scenarios. However, we find that MMD's value can be the\nsame for many pairs of distributions that have different norms in the same\nreproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), making MMD less informative when\nassessing the closeness levels for multiple distribution pairs. To mitigate the\nissue, we design a new measurement of distributional discrepancy, norm-adaptive\nMMD (NAMMD), which scales MMD's value using the RKHS norms of distributions.\nBased on the asymptotic distribution of NAMMD, we finally propose the\nNAMMD-based DCT to assess the closeness levels of a distribution pair.\nTheoretically, we prove that NAMMD-based DCT has higher test power compared to\nMMD-based DCT, with bounded type-I error, which is also validated by extensive\nexperiments on many types of data (e.g., synthetic noise, real images).\nFurthermore, we also apply the proposed NAMMD for addressing the two-sample\ntesting problem and find NAMMD-based two-sample test has higher test power than\nthe MMD-based two-sample test in both theory and experiments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u63a5\u8fd1\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5NAMMD\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408RKHS\u8303\u6570\u6539\u8fdbMMD\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6d4b\u8bd5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709DCT\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u4e00\u7ef4\u79bb\u6563\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5982\u56fe\u50cf\uff09\uff0c\u4e14MMD\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u5206\u5e03\u5bf9\u65f6\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5dee\u5f02\u5ea6\u91cfNAMMD\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7f29\u653eMMD\u503c\u4ee5\u7ed3\u5408RKHS\u8303\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u5176\u6e10\u8fd1\u5206\u5e03\u63d0\u51faNAMMD-based DCT\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660eNAMMD-based DCT\u6bd4MMD-based DCT\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u7c7b\u578bI\u8bef\u5dee\u6709\u754c\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "NAMMD\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9002\u7528\u4e8eDCT\uff0c\u8fd8\u5728\u4e24\u6837\u672c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

We show that it is easy to\nimplement and can be further generalized to training with quality scored data.\nThe resulting SFT variants are competitive with more advanced RL algorithms for\nlarge language models and for training policies in continuous control tasks.\nFor example achieving 66.7% on the AIME 2024 dataset.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u884c\u4e3a\u514b\u9686\uff08BC\uff09\u4e0e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08iw-SFT\uff09\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u4e86RL\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u884c\u4e3a\u514b\u9686\uff08BC\uff09\u5728\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff08SFT\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u5176\u4e0e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u4ee5\u6539\u8fdb\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u52a0\u6743\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff08iw-SFT\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316RL\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u66f4\u7d27\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u4f20\u7edfSFT\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "iw-SFT\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u5728AIME 2024\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523066.7%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4e0e\u9ad8\u7ea7RL\u7b97\u6cd5\u7ade\u4e89\u3002", "conclusion": "iw-SFT\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u63a7\u5236\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1RL\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Among various CIR approaches, training-free zero-shot\nmethods based on pre-trained models are cost-effective but still face notable\nlimitations. For example, sequential VLM-LLM pipelines process each modality\nindependently, which often results in information loss and limits cross-modal\ninteraction. In contrast, methods based on multimodal large language models\n(MLLMs) often focus exclusively on applying changes indicated by the text,\nwithout fully utilizing the contextual visual information from the reference\nimage. To address these issues, we propose multi-faceted Chain-of-Thought with\nre-ranking (MCoT-RE), a training-free zero-shot CIR framework. MCoT-RE utilizes\nmulti-faceted Chain-of-Thought to guide the MLLM to balance explicit\nmodifications and contextual visual cues, generating two distinct captions: one\nfocused on modification and the other integrating comprehensive visual-textual\ncontext. The first caption is used to filter candidate images. Subsequently, we\ncombine these two captions and the reference image to perform multi-grained\nre-ranking. This two-stage approach facilitates precise retrieval by aligning\nwith the textual modification instructions while preserving the visual context\nof the reference image.

In experimental validation on Chinese food image datasets\nChineseFoodNet and CNFOOD-241, the FE-TResNet method significantly improved\nclassification accuracy, achieving rates of 81.37% and 80.29%, respectively,\ndemonstrating its effectiveness and superiority in fine-grained food image\nclassification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aFE-TResNet\u7684\u521b\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u98df\u54c1\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408StyleRM\u548cDCA\u6280\u672f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u98df\u54c1\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u5728\u6280\u672f\u548c\u6587\u5316\u4f20\u627f\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709CNN\u5728\u5904\u7406\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u98df\u54c1\u56fe\u50cf\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eTResNet\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6574\u5408StyleRM\u548cDCA\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728ChineseFoodNet\u548cCNFOOD-241\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u523081.37%\u548c80.29%\u3002", "conclusion": "FE-TResNet\u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u98df\u54c1\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u548c\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002"}}

To pursue a more general solution, this paper focuses on a\nbroader case of reasoning problems that are computable, i.e., problems that\nalgorithms can solve, thus can be solved by the Turing Machine. From this\nperspective, this paper proposes Turing MAchine Imitation Learning (TAIL) to\nimprove the length generalization ability of LLMs. TAIL synthesizes\nchain-of-thoughts (CoT) data that imitate the execution process of a Turing\nMachine by computer programs, which linearly expands the reasoning steps into\natomic states to alleviate shortcut learning and explicit memory fetch\nmechanism to reduce the difficulties of dynamic and long-range data access in\nelementary operations. To validate the reliability and universality of TAIL, we\nconstruct a challenging synthetic dataset covering 8 classes of algorithms and\n18 tasks. Without bells and whistles, TAIL significantly improves the length\ngeneralization ability as well as the performance of Qwen2.5-7B on various\ntasks using only synthetic data, surpassing previous methods and DeepSeek-R1.\nThe experimental results reveal that the key concepts in the Turing Machine,\ninstead of the thinking styles, are indispensable for TAIL for length\ngeneralization, through which the model exhibits read-and-write behaviors\nconsistent with the properties of the Turing Machine in their attention layers.\nThis work provides a promising direction for future research in the learning of\nLLM reasoning from synthetic data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faTAIL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u4eff\u56fe\u7075\u673a\u6267\u884c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u5ea6\u6cdb\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3Transformer\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u5ea6\u6cdb\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4e3a\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTAIL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5408\u6210\u6a21\u4eff\u56fe\u7075\u673a\u6267\u884c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u8003\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u6377\u5f84\u5b66\u4e60\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u6570\u636e\u8bbf\u95ee\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "TAIL\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86Qwen2.5-7B\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u957f\u5ea6\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u56fe\u7075\u673a\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6982\u5ff5\u5bf9TAIL\u7684\u957f\u5ea6\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

In doing so, we curate a\ndataset of 600 jokes split across 4 joke types and manually write high-quality\nexplanations. These jokes include heterographic and homographic puns,\ncontemporary internet humour, and topical jokes, where understanding relies on\nreasoning beyond \"common sense\", rooted instead in world knowledge regarding\nnews events and pop culture. Using this dataset, we compare the zero-shot\nabilities of a range of LLMs to accurately and comprehensively explain jokes of\ndifferent types, identifying key research gaps in the task of humour\nexplanation. We find that none of the tested models (inc. reasoning models) are\ncapable of reliably generating adequate explanations of all joke types, further\nhighlighting the narrow focus of most works in computational humour on overly\nsimple joke forms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u5e7d\u9ed8\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u53ef\u9760\u89e3\u91ca\u590d\u6742\u5e7d\u9ed8\u5f62\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8ba1\u7b97\u5e7d\u9ed8\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e8e\u7b80\u77ed\u53cc\u5173\u7b11\u8bdd\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5e7d\u9ed8\u5f62\u5f0f\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b600\u4e2a\u7b11\u8bdd\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d64\u79cd\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u624b\u52a8\u7f16\u5199\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u89e3\u91ca\u3002\u6bd4\u8f83\u591a\u79cdLLMs\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u89e3\u91ca\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684LLMs\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u5747\u65e0\u6cd5\u53ef\u9760\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u7b11\u8bdd\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u5145\u5206\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u5e7d\u9ed8\u9886\u57df\u5bf9\u7b80\u5355\u7b11\u8bdd\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u4ee5\u53caLLMs\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5e7d\u9ed8\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0a\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

Traditional\nflow matching and diffusion policies sample from standard source distributions\n(e.g., Gaussian noise) and require additional conditioning mechanisms like\ncross-attention to condition action generation on visual information, creating\ntime and space overheads. VITA proposes a novel paradigm that treats latent\nimages as the flow source, learning an inherent mapping from vision to action\nwhile eliminating separate conditioning modules and preserving generative\nmodeling capabilities. Learning flows between fundamentally different\nmodalities like vision and action is challenging due to sparse action data\nlacking semantic structures and dimensional mismatches between high-dimensional\nvisual representations and raw actions. We address this by creating a\nstructured action latent space via an autoencoder as the flow matching target,\nup-sampling raw actions to match visual representation shapes. Crucially, we\nsupervise flow matching with both encoder targets and final action outputs\nthrough flow latent decoding, which backpropagates action reconstruction loss\nthrough sequential flow matching ODE solving steps for effective end-to-end\nlearning.

This algorithm provides a pass-band\nspectral filter that allows smoothing without shrinkage, and it can be adapted\nto the graph setting through the Laplacian operator. Given its spectral\nformulation, this method naturally connects to GNN architectures for tasks\nwhere smoothing, when properly controlled, can be beneficial,such as graph\nclassification. The core contribution of the paper lies in the theoretical\nanalysis of the algorithm from a random walks perspective.

In this paper, we propose design criteria to\ngenerate synthetic training datasets for neural networks, which guarantee that\nafter training the resulting networks achieve a certain mean squared error\n(MSE) on new and previously unseen channels.

Recognizing the\nimportance of spectral and temporal information, we introduce the\nWaveletInception-BiLSTM network. The WaveletInception feature extractor\nutilizes a Learnable Wavelet Packet Transform (LWPT) as the stem for extracting\nvibration signal features, incorporating spectral information in the early\nnetwork layers. This is followed by 1D Inception networks that extract\nmulti-scale, high-level features at deeper layers. The extracted vibration\nsignal features are then integrated with operational conditions via a Long\nShort-term Memory (LSTM) layer. The resulting feature extraction network\neffectively analyzes drive-by vibration signals across various measurement\nspeeds without preprocessing and uses LSTM to capture interrelated temporal\ndependencies among different modes of information and to create feature vectors\nfor health condition estimation.

At the same time, Generative AI -- particularly Generative\nAdversarial Networks (GANs) -- have achieved remarkable success across a wide\nrange of domains, such as healthcare, security, and Image Generation. However,\ntraining generative models typically requires large datasets and significant\ncomputational resources, which are often unavailable in real-world settings.\nAcquiring such resources can be costly and inefficient, especially when many\nunderutilized devices -- such as IoT devices and edge devices -- with varying\ncapabilities remain idle. Moreover, obtaining large datasets is challenging due\nto privacy concerns and copyright restrictions, as most devices are unwilling\nto share their data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach\nfor decentralized GAN training that enables the utilization of distributed data\nand underutilized, low-capability devices while not sharing data in its raw\nform. Our approach is designed to tackle key challenges in decentralized\nenvironments, combining KLD-weighted Clustered Federated Learning to address\nthe issues of data heterogeneity and multi-domain datasets, with Heterogeneous\nU-Shaped split learning to tackle the challenge of device heterogeneity under\nstrict data sharing constraints -- ensuring that no labels or raw data, whether\nreal or synthetic, are ever shared between nodes. Experimental results shows\nthat our approach demonstrates consistent and significant improvements across\nkey performance metrics, where it achieves 1.1x -- 2.2x higher image generation\nscores, an average 10% boost in classification metrics (up to 50% in\nmulti-domain non-IID settings), in much lower latency compared to several\nbenchmarks.

Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models often represent\nrelations in a KG as geometric transformations.

However,\nexisting models are often tightly coupled with various time-series-specific\ndesigns, making it difficult to isolate the impact of the architecture itself.\nTo address this, we propose a novel taxonomy that disentangles these designs,\nenabling clearer and more unified comparisons of Transformer architectures. Our\ntaxonomy considers key aspects such as attention mechanisms, forecasting\naggregations, forecasting paradigms, and normalization layers. Through\nextensive experiments, we uncover several key insights: bi-directional\nattention with joint-attention is most effective; more complete forecasting\naggregation improves performance; and the direct-mapping paradigm outperforms\nautoregressive approaches.

However,\ninterrelationship among input modalities, uncertainties due to individual\nuni-modal data and potential clinical applications following such an\nuncertainty decomposition are yet fully understood in the context of\nlarge-scale MLLMs. In this work, we propose a multimodal uncertainty\npropagation model (MUPM) based on uncertainty propagation, to characterise the\nrelationship among the uncertainties arising from image-only, text-only, and\njoint image-text variations in MLLM inputs. Using real clinical data consisting\nof cardiac MR scans and digital health records, we describe that MUPMs can be\noptimised robustly with a few samples. We then show that the fitted MUPMs are\ngeneralisable across different input data distributions and, perhaps\nsurprisingly, across different downstream tasks. Such a transferability may be\nexplained by the shared pretraining, comparatively light MLLM fine-tuning,\nalong with the low-dimensional nature of the MUPMs. More importantly, this\nlearned transferability, quantifying the relationship between these\nuncertainties, led to direct clinical applications in which uncertainties may\nbe estimated and thus analysed robustly for varying data or even a novel set of\ncardiac disease prediction tasks. In addition, we show experimentally the\nefficiency in multimodal data required for estimating the overall uncertainty\nand its ability to identify redundant factors, both of which are considered\npractical yet clinically useful applications with the proposed MUPMs. Codes are\navailable at https://github.com/yucheng722/MUPM.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f20\u64ad\u6a21\u578b\uff08MUPM\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u4e2d\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u6587\u672c\u53ca\u8054\u5408\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8f93\u5165\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\u53ca\u5176\u6f5c\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMUPM\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f20\u64ad\u5206\u6790\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u6587\u672c\u53ca\u8054\u5408\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5fc3\u810fMR\u626b\u63cf\u548c\u6570\u5b57\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "MUPM\u5728\u5c11\u91cf\u6837\u672c\u4e0b\u5373\u53ef\u9c81\u68d2\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u75be\u75c5\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "conclusion": "MUPM\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5316\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5fc3\u810f\u75c5\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

To address these limitations, we introduce\nDifferentiable Architecture Search for Vision Transformer (DASViT), which\nbridges the gap in differentiable search for ViTs and uncovers novel designs.\nExperiments show that DASViT delivers architectures that break traditional\nTransformer encoder designs, outperform ViT-B/16 on multiple datasets, and\nachieve superior efficiency with fewer parameters and FLOPs.", "AI": {"tldr": "DASViT\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u67b6\u6784\u641c\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e13\u4e3aVision Transformers\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u521b\u65b0\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u5927\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684NAS\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eViT\u65f6\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u79bb\u6563\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u8fdb\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff09\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u53d1\u73b0\u521b\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDASViT\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u67b6\u6784\u641c\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9ViT\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u65b0\u9896\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "result": "DASViT\u751f\u6210\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u6253\u7834\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfTransformer\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8eViT-B/16\uff0c\u4e14\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u66f4\u5c11\u3002", "conclusion": "DASViT\u4e3aViT\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u641c\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

However, it is highly\nsusceptible to intrinsic signal errors and human-induced labeling errors, which\nlead to label noise and ultimately degrade model performance. To enhance EEG\nlearning, multimodal knowledge distillation (KD) has been explored to transfer\nknowledge from visual models with rich representations to EEG-based models.\nNevertheless, KD faces two key challenges: modality gap and soft label\nmisalignment. The former arises from the heterogeneous nature of EEG and visual\nfeature spaces, while the latter stems from label inconsistencies that create\ndiscrepancies between ground truth labels and distillation targets. This paper\naddresses semantic uncertainty caused by ambiguous features and weakly defined\nlabels.

A key difficulty in SR is estimating the unobservable feature, which\nencapsulates significant spectral information not captured by RGB imaging\nsensors. The solution lies in effectively constructing the spectral-spatial\njoint distribution conditioned on the RGB image to complement the unobservable\nfeature. Since HSIs share a similar spatial structure with the corresponding\nRGB images, it is rational to capitalize on the rich spatial knowledge in RGB\npre-trained models for spectral-spatial joint distribution learning. To this\nend, we extend the RGB pre-trained latent diffusion model (RGB-LDM) to an\nunobservable feature LDM (ULDM) for SR. As the RGB-LDM and its corresponding\nspatial autoencoder (SpaAE) already excel in spatial knowledge, the ULDM can\nfocus on modeling spectral structure. Moreover, separating the unobservable\nfeature from the HSI reduces the redundant spectral information and empowers\nthe ULDM to learn the joint distribution in a compact latent space.\nSpecifically, we propose a two-stage pipeline consisting of spectral structure\nrepresentation learning and spectral-spatial joint distribution learning to\ntransform the RGB-LDM into the ULDM. In the first stage, a spectral\nunobservable feature autoencoder (SpeUAE) is trained to extract and compress\nthe unobservable feature into a 3D manifold aligned with RGB space.

However, the existing\nrepresentation learning mainly induced from model learning aspects, misaligning\nwith our RL tasks. This work introduces Spectral Bellman Representation, a\nnovel framework derived from the Inherent Bellman Error (IBE) condition, which\naligns with the fundamental structure of Bellman updates across a space of\npossible value functions, therefore, directly towards value-based RL. Our key\ninsight is the discovery of a fundamental spectral relationship: under the\nzero-IBE condition, the transformation of a distribution of value functions by\nthe Bellman operator is intrinsically linked to the feature covariance\nstructure. This spectral connection yields a new, theoretically-grounded\nobjective for learning state-action features that inherently capture this\nBellman-aligned covariance. Our method requires a simple modification to\nexisting algorithms.

Existing MTCDR methods primarily rely on\ndomain-shared entities (\\eg users or items) to fuse and transfer cross-domain\nknowledge, which may be unavailable in non-overlapped recommendation scenarios.\nSome studies model user preferences and item features as domain-sharable\nsemantic representations, which can be utilized to tackle the MTCDR task.\nNevertheless, they often require extensive auxiliary data for pre-training.\nDeveloping more effective solutions for MTCDR remains an important area for\nfurther exploration.\n  Inspired by recent advancements in generative recommendation, this paper\nintroduces GMC, a generative paradigm-based approach for multi-target\ncross-domain recommendation. The core idea of GMC is to leverage semantically\nquantized discrete item identifiers as a medium for integrating multi-domain\nknowledge within a unified generative model. GMC first employs an item\ntokenizer to generate domain-shared semantic identifiers for each item, and\nthen formulates item recommendation as a next-token generation task by training\na domain-unified sequence-to-sequence model. To further leverage the domain\ninformation to enhance performance, we incorporate a domain-aware contrastive\nloss into the semantic identifier learning, and perform domain-specific\nfine-tuning on the unified recommender.

Previous methods solve the issue of\ninsufficient observation by leveraging 4D diffusion models to generate videos\nat novel viewpoints. However, the generated videos from these models often lack\nspatio-temporal consistency, thus degrading view synthesis quality. In this\npaper, we propose a novel sliding iterative denoising process to enhance the\nspatio-temporal consistency of the 4D diffusion model. Specifically, we define\na latent grid in which each latent encodes the image, camera pose, and human\npose for a certain viewpoint and timestamp, then alternately denoising the\nlatent grid along spatial and temporal dimensions with a sliding window, and\nfinally decode the videos at target viewpoints from the corresponding denoised\nlatents. Through the iterative sliding, information flows sufficiently across\nthe latent grid, allowing the diffusion model to obtain a large receptive field\nand thus enhance the 4D consistency of the output, while making the GPU memory\nconsumption affordable. The experiments on the DNA-Rendering and ActorsHQ\ndatasets demonstrate that our method is able to synthesize high-quality and\nconsistent novel-view videos and significantly outperforms the existing\napproaches.

We then design a plug-and-play VideoITG model,\nwhich takes advantage of visual language alignment and reasoning capabilities\nof Video-LLMs, for effective frame selection in a discriminative manner.\nCoupled with Video-LLMs, VideoITG achieves consistent performance improvements\nacross multiple multimodal video understanding benchmarks, showing its\nsuperiority and great potentials for video understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faVideoITG\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6307\u4ee4\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5e27\u9009\u62e9\u548cVidThinker\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u9891\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5e27\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faVideoITG\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408VidThinker\u7ba1\u9053\u8fdb\u884c\u6307\u4ee4\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5e27\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u6784\u5efaVideoITG-40K\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "VideoITG\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "VideoITG\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u548c\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Moreover, instrumental variables also influence the treatment\nassignment mechanism. This situation sets the study apart from a standard\nrandomized controlled trial, where the treatment assignment is random. Due to\nthis situation, the estimated average treatment effect becomes biased. To\naddress this issue, a standard approach is to incorporate the estimated\npropensity score when estimating the average treatment effect. However, these\nmethods incur the risk of misspecification in propensity score models. To solve\nthis issue, a novel method called the \"Self balancing neural network\" (Sbnet),\nwhich lets the model itself obtain its pseudo propensity score from the\nbalancing net, is proposed in this study. The proposed method estimates the\naverage treatment effect by using the balancing net as a key part of the\nfeedforward neural network. This formulation resolves the estimation of the\naverage treatment effect in one step.

In previous editions of the BraTS Local\nSynthesis of Healthy Brain Tissue via Inpainting Challenge, denoising diffusion\nprobabilistic models (DDPMs) demonstrated qualitatively convincing results but\nsuffered from low sampling speed. To mitigate this limitation, we adapted a 2D\nimage generation approach, combining DDPMs with generative adversarial networks\n(GANs) and employing a variance-preserving noise schedule, for the task of 3D\ninpainting. Our experiments showed that the variance-preserving noise schedule\nand the selected reconstruction losses can be effectively utilized for\nhigh-quality 3D inpainting in a few time steps without requiring adversarial\ntraining. We applied our findings to a different architecture, a 3D wavelet\ndiffusion model (WDM3D) that does not include a GAN component. The resulting\nmodel, denoted as fastWDM3D, obtained a SSIM of 0.8571, a MSE of 0.0079, and a\nPSNR of 22.26 on the BraTS inpainting test set. Remarkably, it achieved these\nscores using only two time steps, completing the 3D inpainting process in 1.81\ns per image. When compared to other DDPMs used for healthy brain tissue\ninpainting, our model is up to 800 x faster while still achieving superior\nperformance metrics.

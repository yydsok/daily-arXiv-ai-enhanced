A fundamental challenge is robustly grounding\nnatural language instructions. This requires a precise spatial alignment, which\naccurately locates the coordinates of each element, and, more critically, a\ncorrect semantic alignment, which matches the instructions to the functionally\nappropriate UI element. Although Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards\n(RLVR) has proven to be effective at improving spatial alignment for these\nMLLMs, we find that inefficient exploration bottlenecks semantic alignment,\nwhich prevent models from learning difficult semantic associations. To address\nthis exploration problem, we present Adaptive Exploration Policy Optimization\n(AEPO), a new policy optimization framework. AEPO employs a multi-answer\ngeneration strategy to enforce broader exploration, which is then guided by a\ntheoretically grounded Adaptive Exploration Reward (AER) function derived from\nfirst principles of efficiency eta=U/C. Our AEPO-trained models, InfiGUI-G1-3B\nand InfiGUI-G1-7B, establish new state-of-the-art results across multiple\nchallenging GUI grounding benchmarks, achieving significant relative\nimprovements of up to 9.0% against the naive RLVR baseline on benchmarks\ndesigned to test generalization and semantic understanding.

A key technique in merging methods is sparsification, which\nprunes redundant parameters from task vectors to mitigate interference.\nHowever, prevailing approaches employ a ``one-size-fits-all'' strategy,\napplying a uniform sparsity ratio that overlooks the inherent structural and\nstatistical heterogeneity of model parameters.

To address this limitation, we introduce \\textbf{TADrop}\n(\\textbf{T}ensor-wise \\textbf{A}daptive \\textbf{Drop}), an adaptive\nsparsification strategy that respects this heterogeneity. Instead of a global\nratio, TADrop assigns a tailored sparsity level to each parameter tensor based\non its distributional properties.

As a simple and plug-and-play module, we\nvalidate TADrop by integrating it with foundational, classic, and SOTA merging\nmethods.

This paper introduces GMF-Drive (Gated Mamba Fusion for\nDriving), an end-to-end framework that overcomes these challenges through two\nprincipled innovations.

Second, we propose a novel hierarchical gated mamba\nfusion (GM-Fusion) architecture that substitutes an expensive transformer with\na highly efficient, spatially-aware state-space model (SSM). Our core BEV-SSM\nleverages directional sequencing and adaptive fusion mechanisms to capture\nlong-range dependencies with linear complexity, while explicitly respecting the\nunique spatial properties of the driving scene.

Transfer-based\nattacks create adversarial examples for surrogate models and transfer these\nexamples to target models under black-box scenarios. Recent studies reveal that\nadversarial examples in flat loss landscapes exhibit superior transferability\nto alleviate overfitting on surrogate models. However, the prior arts overlook\nthe influence of perturbation directions, resulting in limited transferability.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel attack method, named Residual Perturbation\nAttack (ResPA), relying on the residual gradient as the perturbation direction\nto guide the adversarial examples toward the flat regions of the loss function.\nSpecifically, ResPA conducts an exponential moving average on the input\ngradients to obtain the first moment as the reference gradient, which\nencompasses the direction of historical gradients. Instead of heavily relying\non the local flatness that stems from the current gradients as the perturbation\ndirection, ResPA further considers the residual between the current gradient\nand the reference gradient to capture the changes in the global perturbation\ndirection. The experimental results demonstrate the better transferability of\nResPA than the existing typical transfer-based attack methods, while the\ntransferability can be further improved by combining ResPA with the current\ninput transformation methods.

These specialized models, tailored for specific anomaly types\nlike textural defects or logical errors, typically exhibit limited performance\nwhen deployed outside their designated contexts. To overcome this limitation,\nwe propose AnomalyMoE, a novel and universal anomaly detection framework based\non a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. Our key insight is to decompose the\ncomplex anomaly detection problem into three distinct semantic hierarchies:\nlocal structural anomalies, component-level semantic anomalies, and global\nlogical anomalies. AnomalyMoE correspondingly employs three dedicated expert\nnetworks at the patch, component, and global levels, and is specialized in\nreconstructing features and identifying deviations at its designated semantic\nlevel. This hierarchical design allows a single model to concurrently\nunderstand and detect a wide spectrum of anomalies. Furthermore, we introduce\nan Expert Information Repulsion (EIR) module to promote expert diversity and an\nExpert Selection Balancing (ESB) module to ensure the comprehensive utilization\nof all experts. Experiments on 8 challenging datasets spanning industrial\nimaging, 3D point clouds, medical imaging, video surveillance, and logical\nanomaly detection demonstrate that AnomalyMoE establishes new state-of-the-art\nperformance, significantly outperforming specialized methods in their\nrespective domains."}

The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance,\noutperforming more complex, recent approaches in average cross-dataset AUROC.\nOur analysis yields two primary findings for the field: 1) training on paired\nreal-fake data from the same source video is essential for mitigating shortcut\nlearning and improving generalization, and 2) detection difficulty on academic\ndatasets has not strictly increased over time, with models trained on older,\ndiverse datasets showing strong generalization capabilities.\n  This work delivers a computationally efficient and reproducible method,\nproving that state-of-the-art generalization is attainable by making targeted,\nminimal changes to a pre-trained CLIP model.

However, most existing studies focus on either\nheterogeneity or heterophily in isolation, overlooking the prevalence of\nheterophilic HGs in practical applications. Such ignorance leads to their\nperformance degradation. In this work, we first identify two main challenges in\nmodeling heterophily HGs: (1) varying heterophily distributions across hops and\nmeta-paths; (2) the intricate and often heterophily-driven diversity of\nsemantic information across different meta-paths. Then, we propose the Adaptive\nHeterogeneous Graph Neural Network (AHGNN) to tackle these challenges. AHGNN\nemploys a heterophily-aware convolution that accounts for heterophily\ndistributions specific to both hops and meta-paths. It then integrates messages\nfrom diverse semantic spaces using a coarse-to-fine attention mechanism, which\nfilters out noise and emphasizes informative signals. Experiments on seven\nreal-world graphs and twenty baselines demonstrate the superior performance of\nAHGNN, particularly in high-heterophily situations."}

However, because short text\nrepresentations have limited expressiveness, conventional methods struggle to\nidentify cluster centers that truly capture each category's underlying\nsemantics, causing the representations to be optimized in suboptimal\ndirections. To address this issue, we propose IOCC, a novel few-shot\ncontrastive learning method that achieves alignment between the cluster centers\nand the semantic centers. IOCC consists of two key modules:\nInteraction-enhanced Optimal Transport (IEOT) and Center-aware Contrastive\nLearning (CACL). Specifically, IEOT incorporates semantic interactions between\nindividual samples into the conventional optimal transport problem, and\ngenerate pseudo-labels. Based on these pseudo-labels, we aggregate\nhigh-confidence samples to construct pseudo-centers that approximate the\nsemantic centers. Next, CACL optimizes text representations toward their\ncorresponding pseudo-centers. As training progresses, the collaboration between\nthe two modules gradually reduces the gap between cluster centers and semantic\ncenters. Therefore, the model will learn a high-quality distribution, improving\nclustering performance. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets show\nthat IOCC outperforms previous methods, achieving up to 7.34\\% improvement on\nchallenging Biomedical dataset and also excelling in clustering stability and\nefficiency.

In this paper, we introduce\nTRUST, a novel UDA approach that exploits the robustness of the language\nmodality to guide the adaptation of a vision model.

To\nfurther increase the robustness of the vision model, we propose a multimodal\nsoft-contrastive learning loss that aligns the vision and language feature\nspaces, by leveraging captions to guide the contrastive training of the vision\nmodel on target images. In our contrastive loss, each pair of images acts as\nboth a positive and a negative pair and their feature representations are\nattracted and repulsed with a strength proportional to the similarity of their\ncaptions.

We identify shortcut learning -- the\nreliance on task-irrelevant features -- as a key impediment to generalization.\nThrough comprehensive theoretical and empirical analysis, we uncover two\nprimary contributors to shortcut learning: (1) limited diversity within\nindividual sub-datasets, and (2) significant distributional disparities across\nsub-datasets, leading to dataset fragmentation. These issues arise from the\ninherent structure of large-scale datasets like OXE, which are typically\ncomposed of multiple sub-datasets collected independently across varied\nenvironments and embodiments. Our findings provide critical insights into\ndataset collection strategies that can reduce shortcut learning and enhance the\ngeneralization ability of generalist robot policies.

We also analyze results across demographic groups, and show that\nIn-gallery / Out-of-gallery classification accuracy is similar across\ndemographics. Our approach has the potential to provide an objective estimate\nof whether a one-to-many facial identification is Out-of-gallery, and thereby\nto reduce false positive identifications, wrongful arrests, and wasted\ninvestigative time. Interestingly, comparing the results of older deep\nCNN-based face matchers with newer ones suggests that the effectiveness of our\nOut-of-gallery detection approach emerges only with matchers trained using\nadvanced margin-based loss functions."}

Existing studies typically induce such\ndeception by explicitly setting a \"hidden\" objective through prompting or\nfine-tuning, which may not fully reflect real-world human-LLM interactions.\nMoving beyond this human-induced deception, we investigate LLMs' self-initiated\ndeception on benign prompts. To address the absence of ground truth in this\nevaluation, we propose a novel framework using \"contact searching questions.\"\nThis framework introduces two statistical metrics derived from psychological\nprinciples to quantify the likelihood of deception. The first, the Deceptive\nIntention Score, measures the model's bias towards a hidden objective. The\nsecond, Deceptive Behavior Score, measures the inconsistency between the LLM's\ninternal belief and its expressed output.

Land Surface\nTemperature (LST) is a key variable in this context and is retrieved from\nremote sensing satellites. However, these systems face a trade-off between\nspatial and temporal resolution. While spatio-temporal fusion methods offer\npromising solutions, few have addressed the estimation of daily LST at 10 m\nresolution. In this study, we present WGAST, a Weakly-Supervised Generative\nNetwork for Daily 10 m LST Estimation via Spatio-Temporal Fusion of Terra\nMODIS, Landsat 8, and Sentinel-2. WGAST is the first end-to-end deep learning\nframework designed for this task. It adopts a conditional generative\nadversarial architecture, with a generator composed of four stages: feature\nextraction, fusion, LST reconstruction, and noise suppression. The first stage\nemploys a set of encoders to extract multi-level latent representations from\nthe inputs, which are then fused in the second stage using cosine similarity,\nnormalization, and temporal attention mechanisms. The third stage decodes the\nfused features into high-resolution LST, followed by a Gaussian filter to\nsuppress high-frequency noise. Training follows a weakly supervised strategy\nbased on physical averaging principles and reinforced by a PatchGAN\ndiscriminator. Experiments demonstrate that WGAST outperforms existing methods\nin both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Compared to the\nbest-performing baseline, on average, WGAST reduces RMSE by 17.18% and improves\nSSIM by 11.00%. Furthermore, WGAST is robust to cloud-induced LST and\neffectively captures fine-scale thermal patterns, as validated against 33\nground-based sensors.

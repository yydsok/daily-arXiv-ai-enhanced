As a common technique for integrity\nverification and source tracing, digital image watermarking is regarded as a\npotential solution to above issues. Among these, watermarking methods capable\nof preserving the generation quality are receiving increased attention.\nHowever, the proliferation and high performance of generative image editing\napplications have elevated the risks of malicious tampering, creating new\ndemands. 1) The tamper robustness of current lossless visual quality watermarks\nremains constrained by the modification-sensitive diffusion inversion process,\nnecessitating enhanced robustness. 2) The improved tampering quality and rapid\niteration cycles render passive tampering detection methods inadequate, making\nproactive tampering localization capability a desired feature for watermarks.\nTo address these requirements, this paper proposes a Tamper-Aware Generative\nimage WaterMarking method named TAG-WM. The proposed method comprises four key\nmodules: a dual-mark joint sampling (DMJS) algorithm for embedding copyright\nand localization watermarks into the latent space while preserving generative\nquality, the watermark latent reconstruction (WLR) utilizing reversed DMJS, a\ndense variation region detector (DVRD) leveraging diffusion inversion\nsensitivity to identify tampered areas via statistical deviation analysis, and\nthe tamper-aware decoding (TAD) guided by localization results.

Zaiane"], "title": "Evaluating Sound Similarity Metrics for Differentiable, Iterative Sound-Matching", "categories": ["cs.SD", "eess.AS"], "comment": null, "summary": "Manual sound design with a synthesizer is inherently iterative: an artist\ncompares the synthesized output to a mental target, adjusts parameters, and\nrepeats until satisfied. Iterative sound-matching automates this workflow by\ncontinually programming a synthesizer under the guidance of a loss function (or\nsimilarity measure) toward a target sound. Prior comparisons of loss functions\nhave typically favored one metric over another, but only within narrow\nsettings: limited synthesis methods, few loss types, often without blind\nlistening tests. This leaves open the question of whether a universally optimal\nloss exists, or the choice of loss remains a creative decision conditioned on\nthe synthesis method and the sound designer's preference. We propose\ndifferentiable iterative sound-matching as the natural extension of the\navailable literature, since it combines the manual approach to sound design\nwith modern advances in machine learning. To analyze the variability of loss\nfunction performance across synthesizers, we implemented a mix of four novel\nand established differentiable loss functions, and paired them with\ndifferentiable subtractive, additive, and AM synthesizers. For each of the\nsixteen synthesizer--loss combinations, we ran 300 randomized sound-matching\ntrials.

While LLMs appear to defy the traditional trade-off by\noffering high generality and accuracy through simple interfaces, this\nuser-facing simplicity masks a significant shift of complexity to\ninfrastructure, compliance, and specialized personnel. The GAS trade-off,\ntherefore, does not disappear but is relocated from the user to the\norganization, creating new managerial challenges, particularly around accuracy\nin high-stakes applications.

A common limitation in\nexisting vision-based automatic pest counting research is that models are\ntypically evaluated on datasets with ground truth but deployed in real-world\nscenarios without assessing the reliability of counting results due to the lack\nof ground truth. To this end, this paper proposed a method for comprehensively\nevaluating pest counting confidence in the image, based on information related\nto counting results and external environmental conditions. First, a pest\ndetection network is used for pest detection and counting, extracting counting\nresult-related information. Then, the pest images undergo image quality\nassessment, image complexity assessment, and pest distribution uniformity\nassessment. And the changes in image clarity caused by stirring during image\nacquisition are quantified by calculating the average gradient magnitude.\nNotably, we designed a hypothesis-driven multi-factor sensitivity analysis\nmethod to select the optimal image quality assessment and image complexity\nassessment methods. And we proposed an adaptive DBSCAN clustering algorithm for\npest distribution uniformity assessment. Finally, the obtained information\nrelated to counting results and external environmental conditions is input into\na regression model for prediction, resulting in the final pest counting\nconfidence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study dedicated to\ncomprehensively evaluating counting confidence in counting tasks, and\nquantifying the relationship between influencing factors and counting\nconfidence through a model.

However, their increasing connectivity renders them\nhighly vulnerable to sophisticated cyber threats, such as adaptive and zero-day\nattacks, against which traditional security methods like rule-based intrusion\ndetection and single-agent reinforcement learning prove insufficient. To\novercome these challenges, this paper introduces a novel Hierarchical\nAdversarially-Resilient Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (HAMARL) framework.\nHAMARL employs a hierarchical structure consisting of local agents dedicated to\nsubsystem security and a global coordinator that oversees and optimizes\ncomprehensive, system-wide defense strategies.

Based on the\nCORE, we present a text watermarking framework named CoreMark. Specifically,\nCoreMark first dynamically extracts COREs from characters. Then, the characters\nwith stronger robustness are selected according to the lengths of COREs. By\nmodifying the thickness of the CORE, the hidden data is embedded into the\nselected characters without causing significant visual distortions. Moreover, a\ngeneral plug-and-play embedding strength modulator is proposed, which can\nadaptively enhance the robustness for small font sizes by adjusting the\nembedding strength according to the font size.

To thoroughly evaluate PromptAug against other data\naugmentation methods we conduct a robust evaluation using extreme data scarcity\nscenarios, quantitative diversity analysis and a qualitative thematic analysis.\nThe thematic analysis identifies four problematic patterns in augmented text:\nLinguistic Fluidity, Humour Ambiguity, Augmented Content Ambiguity, and\nAugmented Content Misinterpretation.\n  Overall, this work presents PromptAug as an effective method for augmenting\ndata in sensitive tasks like conflict detection, offering a unique,\ninterdisciplinary evaluation grounded in both natural language processing and\nsocial science methodology.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faPromptAug\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u51b2\u7a81\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548cF1\u5206\u6570\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u4e862%\u3002", "motivation": "\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u51b2\u7a81\u68c0\u6d4b\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u4e14\u6602\u8d35\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0cLLM\u7684\u9632\u62a4\u673a\u5236\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u51b2\u7a81\u76f8\u5173\u6570\u636e\u7684\u751f\u6210\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPromptAug\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528LLM\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6781\u7aef\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u573a\u666f\u3001\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5206\u6790\u548c\u4e3b\u9898\u5206\u6790\u8fdb\u884c\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "PromptAug\u5728\u51b2\u7a81\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e862%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548cF1\u5206\u6570\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u4e3b\u9898\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u589e\u5f3a\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u7684\u56db\u79cd\u95ee\u9898\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "PromptAug\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u654f\u611f\u4efb\u52a1\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u79d1\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002"}}

Our method outperforms more resource-intensive\nalternatives in both accuracy and runtime efficiency, validating its robustness\nfor flow estimation at high resolutions. At the time of submission, our method\nranks first on the Spring benchmark with a 1-pixel (1px) outlier rate of 3.289,\nleads Sintel (clean) with an endpoint error (EPE) of 0.963, and achieves the\nbest Fl-all error on KITTI-2015 at 2.94%.

The\ncomplexity of AI systems, coupled with their remarkable capabilities, can lead\nto a reliance on technologies that operate beyond direct human oversight or\nunderstanding.

In this work, we overcome this\nlimitation by pairing NCA with a tiny, shared implicit decoder, inspired by\nrecent advances in implicit neural representations. Following NCA evolution on\na coarse grid, a lightweight decoder renders output images at arbitrary\nresolution. We also propose novel loss functions for both morphogenesis and\ntexture synthesis tasks, specifically tailored for high-resolution output with\nminimal memory and computation overhead. Combining our proposed architecture\nand loss functions brings substantial improvement in quality, efficiency, and\nperformance. NCAs equipped with our implicit decoder can generate full-HD\noutputs in real time while preserving their self-organizing, emergent\nproperties. Moreover, because each MLP processes cell states independently,\ninference remains highly parallelizable and efficient. We demonstrate the\napplicability of our approach across multiple NCA variants (on 2D, 3D grids,\nand 3D meshes) and multiple tasks, including texture generation and\nmorphogenesis (growing patterns from a seed), showing that with our proposed\nframework, NCAs seamlessly scale to high-resolution outputs with minimal\ncomputational overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u9690\u5f0f\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7ec6\u80de\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\uff08NCA\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5b9e\u65f6\u9ad8\u6e05\u751f\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "NCA\u5728\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7f51\u683c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0b\u56e0\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\u5267\u589e\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u64ad\u53d7\u9650\u800c\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u9690\u5f0f\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u7c97\u7f51\u683c\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884cNCA\u6f14\u5316\u540e\u6e32\u67d3\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5b9e\u65f6\u9ad8\u6e05\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u81ea\u7ec4\u7ec7\u548c\u6d8c\u73b0\u7279\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u4f7fNCA\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u53d8\u4f53\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Most existing methods of\nefficient garment unfolding overlook the crucial role of standardization of\nflattened garments, which could significantly simplify downstream tasks like\nfolding, ironing, and packing. This paper presents APS-Net, a novel approach to\ngarment manipulation that combines unfolding and standardization in a unified\nframework. APS-Net employs a dual-arm, multi-primitive policy with dynamic\nfling to quickly unfold crumpled garments and pick-and-place (p and p) for\nprecise alignment. The purpose of garment standardization during unfolding\ninvolves not only maximizing surface coverage but also aligning the garment's\nshape and orientation to predefined requirements. To guide effective robot\nlearning, we introduce a novel factorized reward function for standardization,\nwhich incorporates garment coverage (Cov), keypoint distance (KD), and\nintersection-over-union (IoU) metrics. Additionally, we introduce a spatial\naction mask and an Action Optimized Module to improve unfolding efficiency by\nselecting actions and operation points effectively.

We prove that the answer to this Inverse Fleet Assignment Problem\nis 'yes' for myopic fleet strategies which are more 'selfish' than\n'altruistic', and 'no' otherwise, under mild assumptions on route/link\nperformance functions. To reach these conclusions we introduce the forward\nfleet assignment operator and study its properties, proving that it is\ninvertible for 'bad' objectives of fleet controllers. We also discuss the\nchallenges of implementing myopic fleet routing in the real world and compare\nit to Stackelberg and Nash routing.

In this work, we propose\na method for training a masking network to perform binary object segmentation\nusing weak supervision in the form of image-wise presence or absence of an\nobject of interest, which provides less information but may be obtained more\nquickly from manual or automatic labeling. A key step in our method is that the\nsegmented objects can be placed into background-only images to create\nrealistic, images of the objects with counterfactual backgrounds. To create a\ncontrast between the original and counterfactual background images, we propose\nto first cluster the background-only images, and then during learning create\ncounterfactual images that blend objects segmented from their original source\nbackgrounds to backgrounds chosen from a targeted cluster. One term in the\ntraining loss is the divergence between these counterfactual images and the\nreal object images with backgrounds of the target cluster. The other term is a\nsupervised loss for background-only images. While an adversarial critic could\nprovide the divergence, we use sample-based divergences.

Recently, with the development of Diffusion-based Dense Prediction\n(DDP) models, the exploration of DA designs tailored to this framework is worth\nexploring, since the diffusion model is effective in modeling the distribution\ntransformation that comprises domain information. In this work, we propose a\ntraining-free mechanism for DDP frameworks, endowing them with DA capabilities.\nOur motivation arises from the observation that the exposure bias (e.g., noise\nstatistics bias) in diffusion brings domain shift, and different domains in\nconditions of DDP models can also be effectively captured by the noise\nprediction statistics. Based on this, we propose a training-free Domain Noise\nAlignment (DNA) approach, which alleviates the variations of noise statistics\nto domain changes during the diffusion sampling process, thereby achieving\ndomain adaptation. Specifically, when the source domain is available, we\ndirectly adopt the DNA method to achieve domain adaptation by aligning the\nnoise statistics of the target domain with those of the source domain. For the\nmore challenging source-free DA, inspired by the observation that regions\ncloser to the source domain exhibit higher confidence meeting variations of\nsampling noise, we utilize the statistics from the high-confidence regions\nprogressively to guide the noise statistic adjustment during the sampling\nprocess. Notably, our method demonstrates the effectiveness of enhancing the DA\ncapability of DDP models across four common dense prediction tasks.

Through systematic evaluation on 200 synthetic\nquestions generated with DataMorgana across 64 unique question-user\ncombinations, we demonstrate that neural re-ranking with RankLLaMA improves MAP\nfrom 0.523 to 0.797 (52% relative improvement) but introduces prohibitive\ncomputational costs (84s vs 1.74s per question). While DSPy-optimized prompting\nstrategies achieved higher semantic similarity (0.771 vs 0.668), their 0%\nrefusal rates raised concerns about over-confidence and generalizability. Our\nsubmitted hybrid system without re-ranking achieved 4th place in faithfulness\nand 11th place in correctness among 25 teams. Analysis across question\ncategories reveals that vocabulary alignment between questions and documents\nwas the strongest predictor of performance on our development set, with\ndocument-similar phrasing improving cosine similarity from 0.562 to 0.762.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u53c2\u52a0LiveRAG Challenge 2025\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7a00\u758f\uff08BM25\uff09\u548c\u5bc6\u96c6\uff08E5\uff09\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Falcon3-10B-Instruct\u751f\u6210\u7b54\u6848\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u795e\u7ecf\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\uff08RankLLaMA\uff09\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u800cDSPy\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u867d\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u8fc7\u5ea6\u81ea\u4fe1\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u6700\u7ec8\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\u548c\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u52a8\u6001\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08BM25\u548cE5\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Falcon3-10B-Instruct\u751f\u6210\u7b54\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u795e\u7ecf\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\uff08RankLLaMA\uff09\u548cDSPy\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u795e\u7ecf\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff08MAP\u4ece0.523\u52300.797\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff1bDSPy\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u8fc7\u5ea6\u81ea\u4fe1\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u6700\u7ec8\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u6bd4\u8d5b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6df7\u5408\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u6743\u8861\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002\u8bcd\u6c47\u5bf9\u9f50\u662f\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u952e\u9884\u6d4b\u56e0\u7d20\u3002"}}

Data was\ncaptured using a stereo RGB-inertial sensor, a monocular monochrome camera, and\nfor the first time, a novel single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) camera. We\nrecorded both static and dynamic image sequences, with robots navigating at\nslow (5 cm/s) and fast (50 cm/s) speeds.

This is particularly useful for achieving adversarial robustness, as\nadversarially training models from scratch is very computationally expensive.\nHowever, high robustness in transfer learning still requires adversarial\ntraining during the fine-tuning phase, which requires up to an order of\nmagnitude more time than standard fine-tuning. In this work, we revisit the use\nof the fast gradient sign method (FGSM) in robust transfer learning to improve\nthe computational cost of adversarial fine-tuning. We surprisingly find that\nFGSM is much more stable in adversarial fine-tuning than when training from\nscratch. In particular, FGSM fine-tuning does not suffer from any issues with\ncatastrophic overfitting at standard perturbation budgets of $\\varepsilon=4$ or\n$\\varepsilon=8$. This stability is further enhanced with parameter-efficient\nfine-tuning methods, where FGSM remains stable even up to $\\varepsilon=32$ for\nlinear probing. We demonstrate how this stability translates into performance\nacross multiple datasets. Compared to fine-tuning with the more commonly used\nmethod of projected gradient descent (PGD), on average, FGSM only loses 0.39%\nand 1.39% test robustness for $\\varepsilon=4$ and $\\varepsilon=8$ while using\n$4\\times$ less training time.

However, due to the lack of visible light at night,\nit is impossible to conduct continuous all-day weather observations using\nvisible light reflectance data. This study pioneers the use of generative\ndiffusion models to address this limitation. Based on the multi-band thermal\ninfrared brightness temperature data from the Advanced Geostationary Radiation\nImager (AGRI) onboard the Fengyun-4B (FY4B) geostationary satellite, we\ndeveloped a high-precision visible light reflectance retrieval model, called\nReflectance Diffusion (RefDiff), which enables 0.47~\\mu\\mathrm{m},\n0.65~\\mu\\mathrm{m}, and 0.825~\\mu\\mathrm{m} bands visible light reflectance\nretrieval at night. Compared to the classical models, RefDiff not only\nsignificantly improves accuracy through ensemble averaging but also provides\nuncertainty estimation.

Existing approaches for multi-robot\nrelative localization often depend on costly or short-range sensors like\ncameras and LiDARs. Consequently, these approaches face challenges such as high\ncomputational overhead (e.g., map merging) and difficulties in disjoint\nenvironments. To address this limitation, this paper introduces MGPRL, a novel\ndistributed framework for multi-robot relative localization using convex-hull\nof multiple Wi-Fi access points (AP). To accomplish this, we employ\nco-regionalized multi-output Gaussian Processes for efficient Radio Signal\nStrength Indicator (RSSI) field prediction and perform uncertainty-aware\nmulti-AP localization, which is further coupled with weighted convex hull-based\nalignment for robust relative pose estimation. Each robot predicts the RSSI\nfield of the environment by an online scan of APs in its environment, which are\nutilized for position estimation of multiple APs. To perform relative\nlocalization, each robot aligns the convex hull of its predicted AP locations\nwith that of the neighbor robots. This approach is well-suited for devices with\nlimited computational resources and operates solely on widely available Wi-Fi\nRSSI measurements without necessitating any dedicated pre-calibration or\noffline fingerprinting. We rigorously evaluate the performance of the proposed\nMGPRL in ROS simulations and demonstrate it with real-world experiments,\ncomparing it against multiple state-of-the-art approaches.

Traditional frameworks integrating\nsemantic tokens with flow matching (FM) struggle with streaming capabilities\ndue to their reliance on a global receptive field. Additionally, directly\nimplementing token-by-token streaming speech generation often results in\ndegraded audio quality. To address these challenges, we propose StreamFlow, a\nnovel neural architecture that facilitates streaming flow matching with\ndiffusion transformers (DiT). To mitigate the long-sequence extrapolation\nissues arising from lengthy historical dependencies, we design a local\nblock-wise receptive field strategy. Specifically, the sequence is first\nsegmented into blocks, and we introduce block-wise attention masks that enable\nthe current block to receive information from the previous or subsequent block.\nThese attention masks are combined hierarchically across different DiT-blocks\nto regulate the receptive field of DiTs. Both subjective and objective\nexperimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves performance\ncomparable to non-streaming methods while surpassing other streaming methods in\nterms of speech quality, all the while effectively managing inference time\nduring long-sequence generation.

A\ndrafter-based speculative decoding leverages one or more smaller language\nmodels, a.k.a. drafters or draft models, to sample a draft sequence or tree\nconsisting of multiple tokens, followed by verification by a base LLM, a target\nmodel, accepting a subset as its valid generation. As it is usually considered\nthat the speculative decoding requires one-to-one mapping between vocabularies\nof the target model and the draft model, it has been natural to share the\nvocabulary between them, or even share the LM head as in EAGLE or Medusa. We\nfirst identify that this draft token sampling scheme inherently contains an\nunnecessary inference overhead in drafting, especially for some target LLMs\nwith very large vocabularies. Then, we propose a simple technique, VocabTrim,\nto mitigate the drafting overhead to improve the generation speed in\nmemory-bound environment. VocabTrim reconstructs the drafter LM head to contain\nonly a limited set of tokens, selected by the most frequently sampled from the\nvocabulary of the target model. While limiting the vocabulary in drafting\nslightly degrades the acceptance rate, it significantly reduces the drafting\nlatency in memory-bound process which is often the case on edge devices,\nresulting in higher memory-bound speed up (MBSU).

The result is mixed. mAP@50 score of Yolov11 and 12 was 81.9%\ncompared to RF-DETR, which was 77.7%.

However,\ntraditional node-based message passing mechanisms, when applied to knowledge\ngraphs, often introduce noise and suffer from information dilution or\nover-smoothing by indiscriminately aggregating information from all neighboring\nedges. To address this challenge, we propose a semantic-aware relational\nmessage passing. A core innovation of this framework is the introduction of a\n\\textbf{semantic-aware Top-K neighbor selection strategy}. Specifically, this\nstrategy first evaluates the semantic relevance between a central node and its\nincident edges within a shared latent space, selecting only the Top-K most\npertinent ones. Subsequently, information from these selected edges is\neffectively fused with the central node's own representation using a\n\\textbf{multi-head attention aggregator} to generate a semantically focused\nnode message. In this manner, our model not only leverages the structure and\nfeatures of edges within the knowledge graph but also more accurately captures\nand propagates the contextual information most relevant to the specific link\nprediction task, thereby effectively mitigating interference from irrelevant\ninformation.

In the process, it introduces a new way to perform end-to-end video\nobject detection that improves upon existing video detectors in two key ways.\nFirst, by representing objects as variable-length sequences of discrete tokens,\nwe can succinctly represent widely varying numbers of video objects, with\ndiverse shapes and locations, without having to inject any localization cues in\nthe training process. This eliminates the need to sample the space of all\npossible boxes that constrains conventional detectors and thus solves the dual\nproblems of loss sparsity during training and heuristics-based postprocessing\nduring inference. Second, it conceptualizes and outputs the video objects as\nfully integrated and indivisible 3D boxes or tracklets instead of generating\nimage-specific 2D boxes and linking these boxes together to construct the video\nobject, as done in most conventional detectors. This allows it to scale\neffortlessly with available computational resources by simply increasing the\nlength of the video subsequence that the network takes as input, even\ngeneralizing to multi-object tracking if the subsequence can span the entire\nvideo. We compare our video detector with the baseline Pix2Seq static detector\non several datasets and demonstrate consistent improvement, although with\nstrong signs of being bottlenecked by our limited computational resources.

Additionally, to ensure natural and human-like dexterous motions,\nwe utilize teleoperation for data collection, enabling the robot's movements to\nalign with human behaviors and habits, which is a crucial characteristic for\nintelligent humanoid robots. Furthermore, we propose an effective solution,\nDynamicGrasp, for human-to-robot handover and evaluate various state-of-the-art\napproaches, including auto-regressive models and diffusion policy methods,\nproviding a thorough comparison and analysis. We believe our benchmark will\ndrive advancements in human-to-robot handover research by offering a\nhigh-quality dataset, effective solutions, and comprehensive evaluation\nmetrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86DexH2R\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4eba\u673a\u624b\u90e8\u4ea4\u63a5\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86DynamicGrasp\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4eba\u673a\u624b\u90e8\u4ea4\u63a5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u7075\u5de7\u6293\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8fdc\u7a0b\u64cd\u4f5c\u6536\u96c6\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6784\u5efaDexH2R\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51faDynamicGrasp\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5305\u542b\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5bf9\u8c61\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0cDynamicGrasp\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "DexH2R\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548cDynamicGrasp\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u5c06\u63a8\u52a8\u4eba\u673a\u624b\u90e8\u4ea4\u63a5\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002"}}

In particular, how LLMs balance self-interest and\ncollective well-being is a critical challenge for ensuring alignment,\nrobustness, and safe deployment. In this paper, we examine the challenge of\ncostly sanctioning in multi-agent LLM systems, where an agent must decide\nwhether to invest its own resources to incentivize cooperation or penalize\ndefection. To study this, we adapt a public goods game with institutional\nchoice from behavioral economics, allowing us to observe how different LLMs\nnavigate social dilemmas over repeated interactions. Our analysis reveals four\ndistinct behavioral patterns among models: some consistently establish and\nsustain high levels of cooperation, others fluctuate between engagement and\ndisengagement, some gradually decline in cooperative behavior over time, and\nothers rigidly follow fixed strategies regardless of outcomes. Surprisingly, we\nfind that reasoning LLMs, such as the o1 series, struggle significantly with\ncooperation, whereas some traditional LLMs consistently achieve high levels of\ncooperation. These findings suggest that the current approach to improving\nLLMs, which focuses on enhancing their reasoning capabilities, does not\nnecessarily lead to cooperation, providing valuable insights for deploying LLM\nagents in environments that require sustained collaboration.

However, models can suffer from mode collapse, where only the most\nlikely mode is predicted, posing significant safety risks. While existing\nmethods employ various strategies to generate diverse predictions, they often\noverlook the diversity in interaction modes among agents. Additionally,\ntraditional metrics for evaluating prediction models are dataset-dependent and\ndo not evaluate inter-agent interactions quantitatively. To our knowledge, none\nof the existing metrics explicitly evaluates mode collapse. In this paper, we\npropose a novel evaluation framework that assesses mode collapse in joint\ntrajectory predictions, focusing on safety-critical interactions. We introduce\nmetrics for mode collapse, mode correctness, and coverage, emphasizing the\nsequential dimension of predictions.

These are coupled via selective joint attention layers\nand incorporate key architectural choices, such as temporally aligned\npositional embeddings and localized joint attention masking, to enable\neffective cross-modal interaction while preserving modality-specific strengths.\nTrained with an inpainting-style objective, JAM-Flow supports a wide array of\nconditioning inputs-including text, reference audio, and reference\nmotion-facilitating tasks such as synchronized talking head generation from\ntext, audio-driven animation, and much more, within a single, coherent model.\nJAM-Flow significantly advances multi-modal generative modeling by providing a\npractical solution for holistic audio-visual synthesis. project page:\nhttps://joonghyuk.com/jamflow-web", "AI": {"tldr": "JAM-Flow\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u5668\uff08MM-DiT\uff09\u540c\u65f6\u5408\u6210\u9762\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u8bed\u97f3\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u8f93\u5165\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u5e38\u5c06\u9762\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\u5408\u6210\u548c\u8bed\u97f3\u5408\u6210\u89c6\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u4e8c\u8005\u7684\u5185\u5728\u8054\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u548cMM-DiT\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Motion-DiT\u548cAudio-DiT\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u8054\u5408\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5c42\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "result": "JAM-Flow\u652f\u6301\u4ece\u6587\u672c\u3001\u53c2\u8003\u97f3\u9891\u6216\u8fd0\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u540c\u6b65\u7684\u8bf4\u8bdd\u5934\u90e8\u52a8\u753b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u7684\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u5408\u6210\u3002", "conclusion": "JAM-Flow\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u5408\u6210\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Unlike previous approaches that primarily aim to\nincrease the diversity of training partners, CooT explicitly focuses on\nadapting to new partner behaviors by predicting actions aligned with observed\npartner interactions. Trained on interaction trajectories collected from\ndiverse pairs of agents with complementary behaviors, CooT quickly learns\neffective coordination strategies without explicit supervision or fine-tuning.\nEvaluations on the Overcooked benchmark demonstrate that CooT significantly\noutperforms baseline methods in coordination tasks involving previously unseen\npartners. Human evaluations further confirm CooT as the most effective\ncollaborative partner, while extensive ablations highlight its robustness,\nflexibility, and sensitivity to context in multi-agent scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aCoordination Transformers (CooT)\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u4ea4\u4e92\u5386\u53f2\u5feb\u901f\u9002\u5e94\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\u4f19\u4f34\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u534f\u8c03\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u6216\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4ea4\u4e92\u5386\u53f2\u9884\u6d4b\u5408\u4f5c\u4f19\u4f34\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u76d1\u7763\u6216\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5feb\u901f\u5b66\u4e60\u534f\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728Overcooked\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e5f\u8bc1\u5b9e\u5176\u9ad8\u6548\u534f\u4f5c\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "CooT\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u5bf9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u9ad8\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002"}}

Additive Manufacturing (AM) has emerged as a\npromising technology to enhance customization capabilities, enabling greater\nflexibility, reduced lead times, and more efficient material usage. However,\ntraditional AM systems remain constrained by static setups and human worker\ndependencies, resulting in long lead times and limited scalability. Mobile\nrobots can improve the flexibility of production systems by transporting\nproducts to designated locations in a dynamic environment. By integrating AM\nsystems with mobile robots, manufacturers can optimize travel time for\npreparatory tasks and distributed printing operations. Mobile AM robots have\nbeen deployed for on-site production of large-scale structures, but often\nneglect critical print quality metrics like surface roughness.

Second, these questions are reformulated\ninto an open-ended format and filtered using a multi-model voting technique to\neliminate shortcut cases related to guessing and memorization, ensuring robust\nreasoning evaluations. Third, we annotate the questions with detailed\nstep-by-step solutions, and design a reference-based ternary scoring mechanism\nto reliably assess intermediate reasoning steps.

We conduct a comprehensive empirical\nevaluation of all the variants in our framework across language modeling,\nsyntactic generalization, summarization, dialogue, and inference efficiency.\nBased on the experimental results, we make multiple recommendations on the\ndesign of compositional SLMs. Our code is released at\nhttps://github.com/zhaoyd1/compositional_SLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u57fa\u4e8e\u6210\u5206\u53e5\u6cd5\u6811\u7684\u5408\u6210\u53e5\u6cd5\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08SLMs\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u53d8\u4f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5408\u6210SLMs\u8bbe\u8ba1\u591a\u6837\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u65b0\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u53e5\u6cd5\u6cdb\u5316\u7b49\uff09\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u4e0d\u540c\u53d8\u4f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u636e\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u4e3a\u5408\u6210SLMs\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u6e90\u4e86\u4ee3\u7801\u3002"}}

In this paper, we present a method to solve\nthese two problems jointly from a sequence of observed point clouds of a single\narticulated object. The main challenge in our problem setting is that the point\nclouds are not assumed to be generated by a fixed set of moving points.\nInstead, each point cloud in the sequence could be an arbitrary sampling of the\nobject surface at that particular time step. Such scenarios occur when the\nobject undergoes major occlusions, or if the dataset is collected using\nmeasurements from multiple sensors asynchronously. In these scenarios, methods\nthat rely on tracking point correspondences are not appropriate. We present an\nalternative approach based on a compact but effective representation where we\nrepresent the object as a collection of simple building blocks modeled as 3D\nGaussians. We parameterize the Gaussians with time-dependent rotations,\ntranslations, and scales that are shared across all time steps. With our\nrepresentation, part segmentation can be achieved by building correspondences\nbetween the observed points and the Gaussians. Moreover, the transformation of\neach point across time can be obtained by following the poses of the assigned\nGaussian (even when the point is not observed). Experiments show that our\nmethod outperforms existing methods that solely rely on finding point\ncorrespondences. Additionally, we extend existing datasets to emulate\nreal-world scenarios by considering viewpoint occlusions. We further\ndemonstrate that our method is more robust to missing points as compared to\nexisting approaches on these challenging datasets, even when some parts are\ncompletely occluded in some time-steps.

However, deploying RL agents in\nproduction environments presents two key challenges: (1) designing an effective\nreward function typically requires an RL expert, and (2) when a game's content\nor mechanics are modified, previously tuned reward weights may no longer be\noptimal. Towards the latter challenge, we propose an automated approach for\niteratively fine-tuning an RL agent's reward function weights, based on a\nuser-defined language based behavioral goal. A Language Model (LM) proposes\nupdated weights at each iteration based on this target behavior and a summary\nof performance statistics from prior training rounds.

Given that escorting often occurs in crowded environments, where\nother individuals may enter the robot's camera view, the robot also needs to\nidentify the specific human it is escorting (the subject) before predicting\ntheir actions. Since no existing model performs both person re-identification\nand action prediction in real-time, we propose a novel neural network\narchitecture that can accomplish both tasks. This enables the robot to adjust\nits speed dynamically based on the escortee's movements and seamlessly resume\nescorting after any disruption. In comparative evaluations against strong\nbaselines, our system demonstrates superior efficiency and effectiveness,\nshowcasing its potential to significantly improve robotic escorting services in\ncomplex, real-world scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u884c\u4eba\u91cd\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u62e5\u6324\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u62a4\u9001\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u62a4\u9001\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u5bfc\u822a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5047\u8bbe\u88ab\u62a4\u9001\u8005\u4f1a\u987a\u5229\u8ddf\u968f\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u62e5\u6324\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5e38\u56e0\u65e0\u6cd5\u7406\u89e3\u4eba\u7c7b\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u800c\u5931\u6548\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u6267\u884c\u884c\u4eba\u91cd\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u901f\u5ea6\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u88ab\u62a4\u9001\u8005\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u6709\u671b\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u590d\u6742\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u62a4\u9001\u670d\u52a1\u3002"}}

As\npassages are places where free space shrinks and becomes constrained, the core\nidea is to leverage the path's passage traversal status to characterize its\naccessible free space comprehensively. To this end, a novel passage detection\nand free space decomposition method using proximity graphs is proposed,\nenabling fast detection of sparse but informative passages and environment\ndecompositions. Based on this preprocessing, optimal path planning with\naccessible free space objectives or constraints is formulated as PTOPP problems\ncompatible with sampling-based optimal planners.

To\ngenerate large-scale and denser colored point clouds, we propose a deep\nlearning-based Joint Geometry and Attribute Up-sampling (JGAU) method that\nlearns to model both geometry and attribute patterns while leveraging spatial\nattribute correlations. First, we establish and release a large-scale dataset\nfor colored point cloud up-sampling called SYSU-PCUD, containing 121\nlarge-scale colored point clouds with diverse geometry and attribute\ncomplexities across six categories and four sampling rates. Second, to improve\nthe quality of up-sampled point clouds, we propose a deep learning-based JGAU\nframework that jointly up-samples geometry and attributes. It consists of a\ngeometry up-sampling network and an attribute up-sampling network, where the\nlatter leverages the up-sampled auxiliary geometry to model neighborhood\ncorrelations of the attributes. Third, we propose two coarse attribute\nup-sampling methods, Geometric Distance Weighted Attribute Interpolation\n(GDWAI) and Deep Learning-based Attribute Interpolation (DLAI), to generate\ncoarse up-sampled attributes for each point. Then, an attribute enhancement\nmodule is introduced to refine these up-sampled attributes and produce\nhigh-quality point clouds by further exploiting intrinsic attribute and\ngeometry patterns. Extensive experiments show that the Peak Signal-to-Noise\nRatio (PSNR) achieved by the proposed JGAU method is 33.90 decibels, 32.10\ndecibels, 31.10 decibels, and 30.39 decibels for up-sampling rates of 4 times,\n8 times, 12 times, and 16 times, respectively.

To address this gap,\nwe introduce INDIC-BIAS, a comprehensive India-centric benchmark designed to\nevaluate fairness of LLMs across 85 identity groups encompassing diverse\ncastes, religions, regions, and tribes. We first consult domain experts to\ncurate over 1,800 socio-cultural topics spanning behaviors and situations,\nwhere biases and stereotypes are likely to emerge. Grounded in these topics, we\ngenerate and manually validate 20,000 real-world scenario templates to probe\nLLMs for fairness. We structure these templates into three evaluation tasks:\nplausibility, judgment, and generation. Our evaluation of 14 popular LLMs on\nthese tasks reveals strong negative biases against marginalized identities,\nwith models frequently reinforcing common stereotypes.

However, their proficiency in these high-level applications\noften assumes a deep understanding of low-level physical prerequisites, a\ncapability that remains largely unverified. For robots to perform actions\nreliably, they must comprehend intrinsic object properties (e.g., material,\nweight), action affordances (e.g., graspable, stackable), and physical\nconstraints (e.g., stability, reachability, or an object's state, such as being\nclosed). Despite the widespread use of VLMs in manipulation tasks, we argue\nthat off-the-shelf models may lack this granular, physically grounded\nunderstanding, as such prerequisites are often overlooked during training.\n  To address this critical gap, we introduce PAC Bench, a comprehensive\nbenchmark designed to systematically evaluate VLMs on their understanding of\ncore Properties, Affordances, and Constraints (PAC) from a task executability\nperspective. PAC Bench features a diverse dataset with over 30,000 annotations,\ncomprising 673 real-world images (115 object classes, 15 property types, and 1\nto 3 affordances defined per class), 100 real-world humanoid-view scenarios,\nand 120 unique simulated constraint scenarios across four tasks.\n  Our evaluations reveal significant gaps in the ability of current VLMs to\ngrasp fundamental physical concepts, highlighting limitations in their\nsuitability for reliable robot manipulation and pointing to key areas for\ntargeted research.

This separate\nencoding fails to bridge the modality gap effectively, and more critically,\nthese methods struggle with the sparsity and noise of single-frame LiDAR, often\nrequiring point cloud accumulation or additional priors to improve reliability.\nInspired by recent progress in detector-free matching paradigms (e.g.\nMatchAnything), we revisit the projection-based approach and introduce the\ndetector-free framework for direct point-pixel matching between LiDAR and\ncamera views. Specifically, we project the LiDAR intensity map into a 2D view\nfrom the LiDAR perspective and feed it into an attention-based detector-free\nmatching network, enabling cross-modal correspondence estimation without\nrelying on multi-frame accumulation.

Second, during the reconstruction process, we devise a\ndifferentiated training strategy that automatically adjust Gaussian\noptimization progress according to scene converge metrics, which achieving\nbetter convergence than baseline methods. Extensive evaluations of publicly\navailable datasets demonstrate that RGE-GS achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance in reconstruction quality.

Concept erasing has been investigated with the goals of deleting\ntarget concepts in diffusion models while preserving other concepts with\nminimal distortion. To achieve these goals, recent concept erasing methods\nusually fine-tune the cross-attention layers of diffusion models. In this work,\nwe first show that merely updating the cross-attention layers in diffusion\nmodels, which is mathematically equivalent to adding \\emph{linear} modules to\nweights, may not be able to preserve diverse remaining concepts. Then, we\npropose a novel framework, dubbed Concept Pinpoint Eraser (CPE), by adding\n\\emph{nonlinear} Residual Attention Gates (ResAGs) that selectively erase (or\ncut) target concepts while safeguarding remaining concepts from broad\ndistributions by employing an attention anchoring loss to prevent the\nforgetting. Moreover, we adversarially train CPE with ResAG and learnable text\nembeddings in an iterative manner to maximize erasing performance and enhance\nrobustness against adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments on the erasure of\ncelebrities, artistic styles, and explicit contents demonstrated that the\nproposed CPE outperforms prior arts by keeping diverse remaining concepts while\ndeleting the target concepts with robustness against attack prompts.

FreqDGT introduces\nfrequency-adaptive processing (FAP) to dynamically weight emotion-relevant\nfrequency bands based on neuroscientific evidence, employs adaptive dynamic\ngraph learning (ADGL) to learn input-specific brain connectivity patterns, and\nimplements multi-scale temporal disentanglement network (MTDN) that combines\nhierarchical temporal transformers with adversarial feature disentanglement to\ncapture both temporal dynamics and ensure cross-subject robustness.\nComprehensive experiments demonstrate that FreqDGT significantly improves\ncross-subject emotion recognition accuracy, confirming the effectiveness of\nintegrating frequency-adaptive, spatial-dynamic, and temporal-hierarchical\nmodeling while ensuring robustness to individual differences.

We introduce the Barycentric Weight Layer (BWLer), which models\nthe PDE solution through barycentric polynomial interpolation. A BWLer can be\nadded on top of an existing MLP (a BWLer-hat) or replace it completely\n(explicit BWLer), cleanly separating how we represent the solution from how we\ntake derivatives for the PDE loss. Using BWLer, we identify fundamental\nprecision limitations within the MLP: on a simple 1-D interpolation task, even\nMLPs with O(1e5) parameters stall around 1e-8 RMSE -- about eight orders above\nfloat64 machine precision -- before any PDE terms are added. In PDE learning,\nadding a BWLer lifts this ceiling and exposes a tradeoff between achievable\naccuracy and the conditioning of the PDE loss. For linear PDEs we fully\ncharacterize this tradeoff with an explicit error decomposition and navigate it\nduring training with spectral derivatives and preconditioning. Across five\nbenchmark PDEs, adding a BWLer on top of an MLP improves RMSE by up to 30x for\nconvection, 10x for reaction, and 1800x for wave equations while remaining\ncompatible with first-order optimizers. Replacing the MLP entirely lets an\nexplicit BWLer reach near-machine-precision on convection, reaction, and wave\nproblems (up to 10 billion times better than prior results) and match the\nperformance of standard PINNs on stiff Burgers' and irregular-geometry Poisson\nproblems.

It constructs projection tensors that bind\nco-occurring features into hierarchical tokens, introducing redundancy (i.e an\nemergent gauge structure) and enabling compression of local activations into\nlong-range dependencies. Curiously, we find that the retokenizer can filter\nnatural language patterns from noise, generating synthetic languages with\ncoherent internal morphology -- quantifiably the same as human language.\nLanguage is learned in a local (Hebbian) fashion, where model constraints\ndictate allowed emergent structure, and new information is retained in\nalignment with this structure.

We jointly train both modules in adversarial\nsettings to learn semantic-aware geometry and appearance descriptors.

Specifically, we propose the Multi-Granularity Mix Tokens (MGMT) to\ncapture latent features at varying levels of visual granularity, thereby\nenriching the diversity of the extracted information. Next, we introduce the\nAttribute-guided Visual Feature Extraction (AVFE) module, which leverages\ntextual attributes as queries to retrieve their corresponding visual attribute\nfeatures from the Mix Tokens using a cross-attention mechanism. To ensure that\ntextual attributes focus on the appropriate Mix Tokens, we further incorporate\na Region-Aware Contrastive Learning (RACL) method, encouraging attributes\nwithin the same region to share consistent attention maps.

Finally, we present\nevaluation results for state-of-the-art AL strategies across diverse settings\nand multiple text generation tasks. We show that ATGen reduces both the effort\nof human annotators and costs associated with API calls to LLM-based annotation\nagents.

In reality, what appears as a drifting causal mechanism is\noften the manifestation of a fixed underlying mechanism seen through a narrow\nobservational window. This brings about a problem that, when building a world\nmodel, even subtle shifts in policy or environment states can alter the very\nobserved causal mechanisms. In this work, we introduce the \\textbf{Meta-Causal\nGraph} as world models, a minimal unified representation that efficiently\nencodes the transformation rules governing how causal structures shift across\ndifferent latent world states. A single Meta-Causal Graph is composed of\nmultiple causal subgraphs, each triggered by meta state, which is in the latent\nstate space. Building on this representation, we introduce a\n\\textbf{Causality-Seeking Agent} whose objectives are to (1) identify the meta\nstates that trigger each subgraph, (2) discover the corresponding causal\nrelationships by agent curiosity-driven intervention policy, and (3)\niteratively refine the Meta-Causal Graph through ongoing curiosity-driven\nexploration and agent experiences.

In this work, we\npresent the first large-scale real-world dataset enriched with annotations\ncapturing diverse driving preferences, establishing a foundation for\npersonalization in E2EAD. We extract static environmental features from\nreal-world road topology and infer dynamic contextual cues using a fine-tuned\nvisual language model (VLM), enabling consistent and fine-grained scenario\nconstruction. Based on these scenarios, we derive objective preference\nannotations through behavioral distribution analysis and rule-based heuristics.\nTo address the inherent subjectivity of driving style, we further employ the\nVLM to generate subjective annotations by jointly modeling scene semantics and\ndriver behavior. Final high-quality labels are obtained through a\nhuman-in-the-loop verification process that fuses both perspectives.

The score captures spatiotemporal\npixel relevance across adjacent frames by leveraging 2D spatial attention and\n1D temporal modules in text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models, without the\noverhead of computationally expensive 3D attention mechanisms. Integrated into\na latent optimization framework with a latent mask, STR-Match generates\ntemporally consistent and visually faithful videos, maintaining strong\nperformance even under significant domain transformations while preserving key\nvisual attributes of the source.

However, in CP, an ego agent needs\nto receive messages from its collaborators, which makes it vulnerable to\nattacks from malicious agents. To address this critical issue, we propose a\nunified, probability-agnostic, and adaptive framework, namely, CP-Guard, which\nis a tailored defense mechanism for CP deployed by each agent to accurately\ndetect and eliminate malicious agents in its collaboration network. Our key\nidea is to enable CP to reach a consensus rather than a conflict against an ego\nagent's perception results. Based on this idea, we first develop a\nprobability-agnostic sample consensus (PASAC) method to effectively sample a\nsubset of the collaborators and verify the consensus without prior\nprobabilities of malicious agents. Furthermore, we define collaborative\nconsistency loss (CCLoss) for object detection task and bird's eye view (BEV)\nsegmentation task to capture the discrepancy between an ego agent and its\ncollaborators, which is used as a verification criterion for consensus. In\naddition, we propose online adaptive threshold via dual sliding windows to\ndynamically adjust the threshold for consensus verification and ensure the\nreliability of the systems in dynamic environments.

Current deep\nlearning algorithms usually solve for the optimal classifier by\n\\emph{implicitly} estimating the posterior probabilities, \\emph{e.g.}, by\nminimizing the Softmax cross-entropy loss. This simple methodology has been\nproven effective for meticulously balanced academic benchmark datasets.\nHowever, it is not applicable to the long-tailed data distributions in the real\nworld, where it leads to the gradient imbalance issue and fails to ensure the\nBayes optimal decision rule. To address these challenges, this paper presents a\nnovel approach (BAPE) that provides a more precise theoretical estimation of\nthe data distributions by \\emph{explicitly} modeling the parameters of the\nposterior probabilities and solving them with point estimation. Consequently,\nour method directly learns the Bayes classifier without gradient descent based\non Bayes' theorem, simultaneously alleviating the gradient imbalance and\nensuring the Bayes optimal decision rule. Furthermore, we propose a\nstraightforward yet effective \\emph{distribution adjustment} technique. This\nmethod enables the Bayes classifier trained from the long-tailed training set\nto effectively adapt to the test data distribution with an arbitrary imbalance\nfactor, thereby enhancing performance without incurring additional\ncomputational costs. In addition, we demonstrate the gains of our method are\northogonal to existing learning approaches for long-tailed scenarios, as they\nare mostly designed under the principle of \\emph{implicitly} estimating the\nposterior probabilities.

Key to this is the modeling and generation of hierarchical data that\nrepresents the intrinsic structure within datasets. Traditional methods face\nlimitations in terms of computational cost, performance, generative capacity,\nand stability. Recent VAEs based approaches have made strides in addressing\nthese challenges but still require specialized network modules for each tree\nbranch, limiting their stability and ability to capture deep hierarchical\nrelationships. To overcome these challenges, we introduce diffusion-based\napproach called HDTree. HDTree captures tree relationships within a\nhierarchical latent space using a unified hierarchical codebook and quantized\ndiffusion processes to model tree node transitions. This method improves\nstability by eliminating branch-specific modules and enhancing generative\ncapacity through gradual hierarchical changes simulated by the diffusion\nprocess.

In visual paraphrase attacks, an image is altered while preserving\nits core semantic regions, termed Non-Melting Points (NMPs).

Recently, pretrained vision-language\nmodels (VLMs) such as CLIP have been leveraged in GFSS to improve\ngeneralization on novel classes through multi-modal prototypes learning.\nHowever, existing prototype-based methods are inherently deterministic,\nlimiting the adaptability of learned prototypes to diverse samples,\nparticularly for novel classes with scarce annotations.

Additive noise models (ANMs) are widely used to enable\nsample-efficient bivariate causal discovery. However, conventional ANM-based\nmethods fail when unobserved mediators corrupt the causal relationship between\nvariables. This paper makes three key contributions: first, we rigorously\ncharacterize why standard ANM approaches break down in the presence of\nunmeasured mediators. Second, we demonstrate that prior solutions for hidden\nmediation are brittle in finite sample settings, limiting their practical\nutility. To address these gaps, we propose Bivariate Denoising Diffusion (BiDD)\nfor causal discovery, a method designed to handle latent noise introduced by\nunmeasured mediators. Unlike prior methods that infer directionality through\nmean squared error loss comparisons, our approach introduces a novel\nindependence test statistic: during the noising and denoising processes for\neach variable, we condition on the other variable as input and evaluate the\nindependence of the predicted noise relative to this input. We prove asymptotic\nconsistency of BiDD under the ANM, and conjecture that it performs well under\nhidden mediation.

Existing training paradigms,\nincluding Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning with\nVerifiable Reward (RLVR), impose substantial demands on the base VLM, exceeding\nthe capabilities of SVLMs. Consequently, directly applying these paradigms to\nSVLMs often suffers from severe pseudo thinking traces and advantage collapse,\nultimately undermining both thinking reliability and task performance. A\nnatural solution is to combine SFT and RLVR, leveraging their complementarity\nto reduce the dependence on model capacity. However, the widely adopted\ntwo-stage training paradigm still performs poorly on SVLMs, as their tendency\ntoward sub-optimal convergence hinders the trade-off and limits the benefits of\nthe combination. To address this, we propose DyME, a novel training paradigm\nthat Dynamically selects between Memorization (via SFT) and Exploration (via\nRLVR) modes at each optimization step, ensuring that every update contributes\nto the trade-off. Extensive experiments across diverse domains demonstrate that\nDyME consistently achieves this balance, and thus delivers substantial\nperformance improvements. These results establish DyME as a practical and\neffective solution for empowering SVLMs with reliable thinking capabilities.\nGitHub: https://github.com/HKUST-LongGroup/DyME", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faDyME\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff08SFT\uff09\u548c\u63a2\u7d22\uff08RLVR\uff09\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u601d\u7ef4\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08SVLMs\uff09\u53c2\u6570\u5bb9\u91cf\u6709\u9650\u4e14\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u80fd\u529b\u5f31\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\uff08\u5982SFT\u548cRLVR\uff09\u96be\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f2a\u601d\u7ef4\u75d5\u8ff9\u548c\u4f18\u52bf\u5d29\u6e83\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDyME\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff08SFT\uff09\u548c\u63a2\u7d22\uff08RLVR\uff09\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u6bcf\u6b21\u4f18\u5316\u66f4\u65b0\u90fd\u80fd\u5e73\u8861\u4e24\u8005\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eDyME\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347SVLMs\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u601d\u7ef4\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "DyME\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347SVLMs\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u601d\u7ef4\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

In the context of human\ntrafficking (HT), such techno-solutionism risks oversimplifying exploitation,\nreinforcing power imbalances and causing harm to the very communities AI claims\nto support. In this paper, we introduce the Radical Questioning (RQ) framework\nas a five step, pre-project ethical assessment tool to critically evaluate\nwhether AI should be built at all, especially in domains involving marginalized\npopulations and entrenched systemic injustice. RQ does not replace principles\nbased ethics but precedes it, offering an upstream, deliberative space to\nconfront assumptions, map power, and consider harms before design.

Concurrently, autoregressive (AR) models, particularly those\ngenerating continuous tokens, have emerged as a promising direction for\nunifying text and media generation. This paper introduces Transition Matching\n(TM), a novel discrete-time, continuous-state generative paradigm that unifies\nand advances both diffusion/flow models and continuous AR generation. TM\ndecomposes complex generation tasks into simpler Markov transitions, allowing\nfor expressive non-deterministic probability transition kernels and arbitrary\nnon-continuous supervision processes, thereby unlocking new flexible design\navenues. We explore these choices through three TM variants: (i) Difference\nTransition Matching (DTM), which generalizes flow matching to discrete-time by\ndirectly learning transition probabilities, yielding state-of-the-art image\nquality and text adherence as well as improved sampling efficiency. (ii)\nAutoregressive Transition Matching (ARTM) and (iii) Full History Transition\nMatching (FHTM) are partially and fully causal models, respectively, that\ngeneralize continuous AR methods. They achieve continuous causal AR generation\nquality comparable to non-causal approaches and potentially enable seamless\nintegration with existing AR text generation techniques. Notably, FHTM is the\nfirst fully causal model to match or surpass the performance of flow-based\nmethods on text-to-image task in continuous domains.

Due to the limitations\nof current imaging techniques and the complexity of spinal structures, existing\nmethods still struggle with reducing the impact of image blurring and\ndistinguishing similar vertebrae. To alleviate these issues, we introduce a\nFrequency-enhanced Multi-granularity Context Network (FMC-Net) to improve the\naccuracy of vertebrae segmentation. Specifically, we first apply wavelet\ntransform for lossless downsampling to reduce the feature distortion in blurred\nimages. The decomposed high and low-frequency components are then processed\nseparately. For the high-frequency components, we apply a High-frequency\nFeature Refinement (HFR) to amplify the prominence of key features and filter\nout noises, restoring fine-grained details in blurred images. For the\nlow-frequency components, we use a Multi-granularity State Space Model (MG-SSM)\nto aggregate feature representations with different receptive fields,\nextracting spatially-varying contexts while capturing long-range dependencies\nwith linear complexity. The utilization of multi-granularity contexts is\nessential for distinguishing similar vertebrae and improving segmentation\naccuracy.

Due to the small size and high\nintra-class variability of plaque, CPG is commonly evaluated using a\ncombination of transverse and longitudinal ultrasound views in clinical\npractice. However, most existing deep learning-based multi-view classification\nmethods focus on feature fusion across different views, neglecting the\nimportance of representation learning and the difference in class features. To\naddress these issues, we propose a novel Corpus-View-Category Refinement\nFramework (CVC-RF) that processes information from Corpus-, View-, and\nCategory-levels, enhancing model performance. Our contribution is four-fold.\nFirst, to the best of our knowledge, we are the foremost deep learning-based\nmethod for CPG according to the latest Carotid Plaque-RADS guidelines. Second,\nwe propose a novel center-memory contrastive loss, which enhances the network's\nglobal modeling capability by comparing with representative cluster centers and\ndiverse negative samples at the Corpus level. Third, we design a cascaded\ndown-sampling attention module to fuse multi-scale information and achieve\nimplicit feature interaction at the View level. Finally, a parameter-free\nmixture-of-experts weighting strategy is introduced to leverage class\nclustering knowledge to weight different experts, enabling feature decoupling\nat the Category level.

This principled integration yields\nconsistent improvements across diverse linear inverse problems and demonstrates\nrobust generalization under system misspecification between training and\ndeployment, offering a promising solution to real-world applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u6865\u63a5\u65b9\u6cd5SDBs\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5df2\u77e5\u7ebf\u6027\u6d4b\u91cf\u7cfb\u7edf\u5d4c\u5165\u77e9\u9635\u503cSDE\u7684\u7cfb\u6570\u4e2d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7ebf\u6027\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u9006\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u4ece\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u6216\u566a\u58f0\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u4fe1\u53f7\uff09\u662f\u79d1\u5b66\u4e0e\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u76d1\u7763\u6865\u63a5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff09\u5728\u5229\u7528\u6d4b\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165System embedded Diffusion Bridge Models (SDBs)\uff0c\u5c06\u5df2\u77e5\u7ebf\u6027\u6d4b\u91cf\u7cfb\u7edf\u5d4c\u5165\u77e9\u9635\u503cSDE\u7684\u7cfb\u6570\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "SDBs\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u7ebf\u6027\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u90e8\u7f72\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u65f6\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SDBs\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To address these issues, we propose MoCa, a two-stage\nframework for transforming pre-trained VLMs into effective bidirectional\nmultimodal embedding models. The first stage, Modality-aware Continual\nPre-training, introduces a joint reconstruction objective that simultaneously\ndenoises interleaved text and image inputs, enhancing bidirectional\ncontext-aware reasoning. The second stage, Heterogeneous Contrastive\nFine-tuning, leverages diverse, semantically rich multimodal data beyond simple\nimage-caption pairs to enhance generalization and alignment. Our method\naddresses the stated limitations by introducing bidirectional attention through\ncontinual pre-training, scaling effectively with massive unlabeled datasets via\njoint reconstruction objectives, and utilizing diverse multimodal data for\nenhanced representation robustness.

To circumvent\nthese costs, some parties may exploit existing models by using the generated\nimages as training data for their own models. In general, watermarking is a\nvaluable tool for detecting unauthorized use of generated images. However, when\nthese images are used to train a new model, watermarking can only enable\ndetection if the watermark persists through training and remains identifiable\nin the outputs of the newly trained model - a property known as radioactivity.\nWe analyze the radioactivity of watermarks in images generated by diffusion\nmodels (DMs) and image autoregressive models (IARs). We find that existing\nwatermarking methods for DMs fail to retain radioactivity, as watermarks are\neither erased during encoding into the latent space or lost in the\nnoising-denoising process (during the training in the latent space).

In response to\nthis challenge, we introduce \\textit{Trident}, a face forgery detection\nframework that employs triplet learning with a Siamese network architecture for\nenhanced adaptability across diverse forgery methods. \\textit{Trident} is\ntrained on curated triplets to isolate nuanced differences of forgeries,\ncapturing fine-grained features that distinguish pristine samples from\nmanipulated ones while controlling for other variables. To further enhance\ngeneralizability, we incorporate domain-adversarial training with a forgery\ndiscriminator.

By grounding generation in the\nretrieved context, P4OMP improves syntactic correctness compared to baseline\nprompting with GPT-3.5-Turbo. We evaluate P4OMP against a baseline,\nGPT-3.5-Turbo without retrieval, on a comprehensive benchmark of 108 real-world\nC++ programs drawn from Stack Overflow, PolyBench, and NAS benchmark suites.\nP4OMP achieves 100% compilation success on all parallelizable cases, while the\nbaseline fails to compile in 20 out of 108 cases. Six cases that rely on\nnon-random-access iterators or thread-unsafe constructs are excluded due to\nfundamental OpenMP limitations.

However, the heavy\nreliance of existing systems on photometric rendering loss for camera tracking\nundermines their robustness, especially in unbounded outdoor environments with\nsevere viewpoint and illumination changes. To address these challenges, we\npropose TVG-SLAM, a robust RGB-only 3DGS SLAM system that leverages a novel\ntri-view geometry paradigm to ensure consistent tracking and high-quality\nmapping. We introduce a dense tri-view matching module that aggregates reliable\npairwise correspondences into consistent tri-view matches, forming robust\ngeometric constraints across frames. For tracking, we propose Hybrid Geometric\nConstraints, which leverage tri-view matches to construct complementary\ngeometric cues alongside photometric loss, ensuring accurate and stable pose\nestimation even under drastic viewpoint shifts and lighting variations. For\nmapping, we propose a new probabilistic initialization strategy that encodes\ngeometric uncertainty from tri-view correspondences into newly initialized\nGaussians. Additionally, we design a Dynamic Attenuation of Rendering Trust\nmechanism to mitigate tracking drift caused by mapping latency. Experiments on\nmultiple public outdoor datasets show that our TVG-SLAM outperforms prior\nRGB-only 3DGS-based SLAM systems.

To\noperationalize similarity to previous research, we introduce two complementary\nmetrics to characterize the local geometry of a publication's semantic\nneighborhood: (1) \\emph{density} ($\\rho$), defined as the ratio between a fixed\nnumber of previously-published papers and the minimum distance enclosing those\npapers in a semantic embedding space, and (2) asymmetry ($\\alpha$), defined as\nthe average directional difference between a paper and its nearest neighbors.\nWe tested the predictive relationship between these two metrics and its\nsubsequent citation rate using a Bayesian hierarchical regression approach,\nsurveying $\\sim 53,000$ publications across nine academic disciplines and five\ndifferent document embeddings. While the individual effects of $\\rho$ on\ncitation count are small and variable, incorporating density-based predictors\nconsistently improves out-of-sample prediction when added to baseline models.\nThese results suggest that the density of a paper's surrounding scientific\nliterature may carry modest but informative signals about its eventual impact.\nMeanwhile, we find no evidence that publication asymmetry improves model\npredictions of citation rates.

To this end, we\nintroduce VolumetricSMPL, a neural volumetric body model that leverages Neural\nBlend Weights (NBW) to generate compact, yet efficient MLP decoders.

VolumetricSMPL outperforms prior volumetric occupancy model\nCOAP with 10x faster inference, 6x lower GPU memory usage, enhanced accuracy,\nand a Signed Distance Function (SDF) for efficient and differentiable contact\nmodeling. We demonstrate VolumetricSMPL's strengths across four challenging\ntasks: (1) reconstructing human-object interactions from in-the-wild images,\n(2) recovering human meshes in 3D scenes from egocentric views, (3)\nscene-constrained motion synthesis, and (4) resolving self-intersections.

However, their scalability remains a problem due to the huge\ncommunication cost among parallel processes. Most of the existing communication\nlatency analysis methods rely on the physical link layer information, which is\nonly available to administrators. In this paper, a framework called PCLVis is\nproposed to help general users analyze process communication latency (PCL)\nevents. Instead of the physical link layer information, the PCLVis uses the MPI\nprocess communication data for the analysis. First, a spatial PCL event\nlocating method is developed. All processes with high correlation are\nclassified into a single cluster by constructing a process-correlation tree.\nSecond, the propagation path of PCL events is analyzed by constructing a\ncommunication-dependency-based directed acyclic graph (DAG), which can help\nusers interactively explore a PCL event from the temporal evolution of a\nlocated PCL event cluster. In this graph, a sliding window algorithm is\ndesigned to generate the PCL events abstraction. Meanwhile, a new glyph called\nthe communication state glyph (CS-Glyph) is designed for each process to show\nits communication states, including its in/out messages and load balance. Each\nleaf node can be further unfolded to view additional information. Third, a PCL\nevent attribution strategy is formulated to help users optimize their\nsimulations.

Despite their advancements, the explainability of MLLMs remains less\nexplored, hindering deeper understanding, model credibility, and effective\nvisualization.

Properties\nsuch as data quality and diversity have been extensively studied and are known\nto enhance model performance. However, it remains unclear whether there exist\nother quantitative and general principles of data selection that can\nconsistently improve performance, especially for complex tasks with limited\nprior knowledge. In this paper, we demonstrate that selecting more uniformly\ndistributed data can improve training efficiency while enhancing performance.\nSpecifically, we establish that more uniform (less biased) distribution leads\nto a larger minimum pairwise distance between data points, denoted by\n$h_{\\min}$, and prove that a smaller $h_{\\min}$ can slow down the training\ndynamics of gradient descent (GD). Moreover, we theoretically show that the\napproximation error of neural networks decreases as $h_{\\min}$ increases. Our\nanalysis introduces a convergence framework for GD beyond the Neural Tangent\nKernel (NTK) regime, applicable to a broad class of architectures, including\ntransformers, without requiring Lipschitz smoothness. This framework further\nprovides theoretical justification for the use of residual connections and\nfunction compositions in deep neural architectures. In the end, we conduct\ncomprehensive experiments for supervised fine-tuning across various settings,\nincluding different optimization strategies, model sizes, and training\ndatasets.

Existing consistent methods often focus on a specific domain with\nspecific aspects of consistency, which significantly constrains their\ngeneralizability to broader applications. In this paper, we propose a more\nchallenging problem, Text-to-ImageSet (T2IS) generation, which aims to generate\nsets of images that meet various consistency requirements based on user\ninstructions. To systematically study this problem, we first introduce\n$\\textbf{T2IS-Bench}$ with 596 diverse instructions across 26 subcategories,\nproviding comprehensive coverage for T2IS generation. Building on this, we\npropose $\\textbf{T2IS-Eval}$, an evaluation framework that transforms user\ninstructions into multifaceted assessment criteria and employs effective\nevaluators to adaptively assess consistency fulfillment between criteria and\ngenerated sets. Subsequently, we propose $\\textbf{AutoT2IS}$, a training-free\nframework that maximally leverages pretrained Diffusion Transformers'\nin-context capabilities to harmonize visual elements to satisfy both\nimage-level prompt alignment and set-level visual consistency.

Through autoregressively injecting\nintensifying Gaussian noise into the denoised data and estimating the\ncorresponding score function, we compare the denoised data with the original\ndata to get a difference and aggregate it with the score function for an\nenhanced appearance perception and accumulate the abnormal context.

We explore\nthe sensitivity of machine learning weather prediction (MLWP) using the 24h\nPangu Weather ML model of Huawei to errors in the initial conditions with a\nspecific kind of Singular Vector (SV) perturbations. Our Arnoldi-SV (A-SV)\nmethod does not need linear nor adjoint model versions and is applicable to\nnumerical weather prediction (NWP) as well as MLWP. It observes error growth\nwithin a given optimization time window by iteratively applying a forecast\nmodel to perturbed model states. This creates a Krylov subspace, implicitly\nbased on a matrix operator, which approximates the local error growth. Each\niteration adds new dimensions to the Krylov space and its leading right SVs are\nexpected to turn into directions of growing errors.

Although existing deepfake detection\nmodels demonstrate outstanding performance in detection metrics, most methods\nonly provide simple binary classification results, lacking interpretability.

This raises new\nquestions about optimal normalization strategies for the applicable task. In\nthis study, we systematically evaluate the impact of normalization granularity\n(recording vs. window level) and scope (cross-channel vs. within-channel) on\nboth supervised (age and gender prediction) and self-supervised (Contrastive\nPredictive Coding) tasks.

The recent 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)\ntechniques and their variants, 4DGS, achieve high-quality renderings of dynamic\nsurgical scenes in real-time.

To address these challenges, we\npresent Endo-4DGX, a novel reconstruction method with illumination-adaptive\nGaussian Splatting designed specifically for endoscopic scenes with uneven\nlighting. By incorporating illumination embeddings, our method effectively\nmodels view-dependent brightness variations. We introduce a region-aware\nenhancement module to model the sub-area lightness at the Gaussian level and a\nspatial-aware adjustment module to learn the view-consistent brightness\nadjustment. With the illumination adaptive design, Endo-4DGX achieves superior\nrendering performance under both low-light and over-exposure conditions while\nmaintaining geometric accuracy. Additionally, we employ an exposure control\nloss to restore the appearance from adverse exposure to the normal level for\nillumination-adaptive optimization.

Pretrained using self-supervised\nlearning on data from laparoscopic surgical tasks and endotracheal intubation\n(ETI), the model achieves greater than 88% classification accuracy on all\ntasks, with Matthews Correlation Coefficient exceeding 0.91 on ETI. It\ngeneralizes to a novel emergency airway procedure--cricothyrotomy--using fewer\nthan 30 labeled samples and a lightweight (less than 2k parameter) adapter\nmodule, attaining an AUC greater than 87%. Interpretability is achieved via a\nnovel channel attention mechanism--developed specifically for fNIRS--that\nidentifies functionally coherent prefrontal sub-networks validated through\nablation studies. Temporal attention patterns align with task-critical phases\nand capture stress-induced changes in neural variability, offering insight into\ndynamic cognitive states.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8de8\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6280\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u6280\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u9700\u8981\u80fd\u591f\u89e3\u7801\u8ba4\u77e5\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5e76\u5177\u6709\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u3001\u4e2a\u4f53\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u73af\u5883\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u3001\u9884\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u4e14\u5bf9\u65b0\u6761\u4ef6\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5904\u7406\u6700\u5c0f\u9884\u5904\u7406\u7684fNIRS\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u9002\u914d\u5668\u6a21\u5757\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8d85\u8fc788%\uff0cMatthews\u76f8\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\u8d85\u8fc70.91\uff0c\u5bf9\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u73af\u7532\u819c\u5207\u5f00\u672f\uff09\u7684AUC\u8d85\u8fc787%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8de8\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6280\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u578b\u901a\u9053\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u8ba4\u77e5\u72b6\u6001\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

Existing attempts to accelerate\nINR encoding often sacrifice reconstruction quality or crucial coordinate-level\ncontrol essential for adaptive streaming and transcoding.

A prevalent issue in compositional generation is the misalignment\nof spatial relationships, as models often fail to faithfully generate images\nthat reflect the spatial configurations specified between objects in the input\nprompts. To address this challenge, we propose a novel probabilistic framework\nfor modeling the relative spatial positioning of objects in a scene, leveraging\nthe concept of Probability of Superiority (PoS). Building on this insight, we\nmake two key contributions. First, we introduce a novel evaluation metric,\nPoS-based Evaluation (PSE), designed to assess the alignment of 2D and 3D\nspatial relationships between text and image, with improved adherence to human\njudgment. Second, we propose PoS-based Generation (PSG), an inference-time\nmethod that improves the alignment of 2D and 3D spatial relationships in T2I\nmodels without requiring fine-tuning. PSG employs a Part-of-Speech PoS-based\nreward function that can be utilized in two distinct ways: (1) as a\ngradient-based guidance mechanism applied to the cross-attention maps during\nthe denoising steps, or (2) as a search-based strategy that evaluates a set of\ninitial noise vectors to select the best one. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat the PSE metric exhibits stronger alignment with human judgment compared to\ntraditional center-based metrics, providing a more nuanced and reliable measure\nof complex spatial relationship accuracy in text-image alignment.

Methods: Four DL models were\ntrained on open-source data that performed: a) Interslice contrast correction;\nb) Interslice respiratory motion correction; c) Super-resolution (slice\ndirection); and d) Segmentation of right and left atria and ventricles (RA, LA,\nRV, and LV), thoracic aorta (Ao) and pulmonary arteries (PA). In 10 patients\nundergoing routine cardiovascular examination, our method was validated on\nprospectively acquired sagittal stacks of real-time cine images. Quantitative\nmetrics (ventricular volumes and vessel diameters) and image quality of the 3D\ncines were compared to conventional breath hold cine and whole heart imaging.\nResults: All real-time data were successfully transformed into 3D cines with a\ntotal post-processing time of <1 min in all cases. There were no significant\nbiases in any LV or RV metrics with reasonable limits of agreement and\ncorrelation. There is also reasonable agreement for all vessel diameters,\nalthough there was a small but significant overestimation of RPA diameter.\nConclusion: We have demonstrated the potential of creating a 3D-cine data from\nconcatenated 2D real-time cine images using a series of DL models. Our method\nhas short acquisition and reconstruction times with fully segmented data being\navailable within 2 minutes. The good agreement with conventional imaging\nsuggests that our method could help to significantly speed up CMR in clinical\npractice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5229\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5c062D\u5b9e\u65f6\u81ea\u7531\u547c\u5438\u7535\u5f71\u56fe\u50cf\u62fc\u63a5\u5e76\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a3D\u7535\u5f71\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u513f\u79d1\u548c\u5148\u5929\u6027\u5fc3\u810f\u75c5\u7684\u5fc3\u8840\u7ba1\u78c1\u5171\u632f\u6210\u50cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5fc3\u8840\u7ba1\u78c1\u5171\u632f\uff08CMR\uff09\u5728\u513f\u79d1\u548c\u5148\u5929\u6027\u5fc3\u810f\u75c5\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u591a\u6b21\u626b\u63cf\uff0c\u8017\u65f6\u8f83\u957f\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u5feb\u901f\u751f\u62103D\u7535\u5f71\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e34\u5e8a\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e86\u56db\u4e2a\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u7528\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6821\u6b63\u3001\u547c\u5438\u8fd0\u52a8\u6821\u6b63\u3001\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u5fc3\u810f\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u5272\u3002\u572810\u540d\u60a3\u8005\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u5c062D\u56fe\u50cf\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a3D\u7535\u5f71\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u5c0f\u4e8e1\u5206\u949f\u3002\u5fc3\u5ba4\u4f53\u79ef\u548c\u8840\u7ba1\u76f4\u5f84\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4f46\u53f3\u80ba\u52a8\u8109\u76f4\u5f84\u7565\u6709\u9ad8\u4f30\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5feb\u901f\u751f\u62103D\u7535\u5f71\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4e0e\u5e38\u89c4\u6210\u50cf\u7ed3\u679c\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e34\u5e8aCMR\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

The aim of TAMP is to restore a damaged target image\nby leveraging the complementary information from a reference image, where both\nimages captured the same scene but with a significant time gap in between,\ni.e., time-variant images. Different from conventional reference-guided image\ninpainting, the reference image under TAMP setup presents significant content\ndistinction to the target image and potentially also suffers from damages.

To further boost the performance, we propose our TAMP\nsolution, namely Interactive Distribution Transition Estimation-driven\nDiffusion (InDiTE-Diff), which integrates InDiTE with SOTA diffusion model and\nconducts latent cross-reference during sampling. Moreover, considering the lack\nof benchmarks for TAMP task, we newly assembled a dataset, i.e., TAMP-Street,\nbased on existing image and mask datasets.

However,\nlarge-scale datasets, specially those constructed from crowd-sourcing and\nweb-scraping, often suffer from label noise, inconsistencies, and errors. This\nproblem is particularly pronounced in manufacturing domains, where obtaining\nhigh-quality labels is costly and time-consuming. This paper introduces\nVision-Language Sanitization and Refinement (VLSR), which is a\nvision-language-based framework for label sanitization and refinement in\nmulti-label manufacturing image datasets. This method embeds both images and\ntheir associated textual labels into a shared semantic space leveraging the\nCLIP vision-language model. Then two key tasks are addressed in this process by\ncomputing the cosine similarity between embeddings. First, label sanitization\nis performed to identify irrelevant, misspelled, or semantically weak labels,\nand surface the most semantically aligned label for each image by comparing\nimage-label pairs using cosine similarity between image and label embeddings.\nSecond, the method applies density-based clustering on text embeddings,\nfollowed by iterative cluster merging, to group semantically similar labels\ninto unified label groups.

A skillful climate model should capture both stationary\nstatistics and responses to external perturbations. While current\nautoregressive neural models often reproduce the former, they typically\nstruggle with the latter. We begin by analyzing a low-dimensional dynamical\nsystem to expose, by analogy, fundamental limitations that persist in\nhigh-dimensional settings. Specifically, we construct neural stochastic models\nunder two scenarios: one where the full state vector is observed, and another\nwith only partial observations (i.e. a subset of variables). In the first case,\nthe models accurately capture both equilibrium statistics and forced responses\nin ensemble mean and variance. In the more realistic case of partial\nobservations, two key challenges emerge: (i) identifying the \\textit{proper}\nvariables to model, and (ii) parameterizing the influence of unobserved degrees\nof freedom. These issues are not specific to neural networks but reflect\nfundamental limitations of data-driven modeling and the need to target the slow\ndynamics of the system. We argue that physically grounded strategies -- such as\ncoarse-graining and stochastic parameterizations -- are critical, both\nconceptually and practically, for the skillful emulation of complex systems\nlike the coupled climate system. Building on these insights, we turn to a more\nrealistic application: a stochastic reduced neural model of the sea surface\ntemperature field and the net radiative flux at the top of the atmosphere,\nassessing its stationary statistics, response to temperature forcing, and\ninterpretability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u5efa\u6a21\u5728\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u795e\u7ecf\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u548c\u968f\u673a\u6c14\u5019\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6355\u6349\u5916\u90e8\u6270\u52a8\u54cd\u5e94\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u63ed\u793a\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u5efa\u6a21\u5728\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u795e\u7ecf\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u6c14\u5019\u7cfb\u7edf\u65f6\u5bf9\u5e73\u8861\u7edf\u8ba1\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u6270\u52a8\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\u5206\u6790\u4f4e\u7ef4\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ee5\u63ed\u793a\u9ad8\u7ef4\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u795e\u7ecf\u968f\u673a\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5168\u89c2\u6d4b\u548c\u90e8\u5206\u89c2\u6d4b\u573a\u666f\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5982\u7c97\u7c92\u5316\u548c\u968f\u673a\u53c2\u6570\u5316\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5168\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e0b\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u6355\u6349\u5e73\u8861\u7edf\u8ba1\u548c\u5f3a\u8feb\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u800c\u90e8\u5206\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e0b\u5219\u9762\u4e34\u53d8\u91cf\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u672a\u89c2\u6d4b\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u8bba\u5f3a\u8c03\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6d77\u9762\u6e29\u5ea6\u573a\u7684\u968f\u673a\u7b80\u5316\u795e\u7ecf\u6a21\u578b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

The choice of data encoding\nscheme dictates the degree of redundancy for a Fourier coefficient.

We trace this\nanomaly to a metric artifact: control-referenced deltas and unweighted error\nmetrics reward mode collapse whenever the control is biased or the biological\nsignal is sparse. Large-scale \\textit{in silico} simulations and analysis of\ntwo real-world perturbation datasets confirm that shared reference shifts, not\ngenuine biological change, drives high performance in these evaluations. We\nintroduce differentially expressed gene (DEG)-aware metrics, weighted\nmean-squared error (WMSE) and weighted delta $R^{2}$ ($R^{2}_{w}(\\Delta)$) with\nrespect to all perturbations, that measure error in niche signals with high\nsensitivity.

The model incorporates\nseveral key innovations: (i) combine cross-platform, multi-resolution dataset\nof 24K examples from diverse sources including mobile, desktop, and web GUI\nscreenshots to effectively address data scarcity in high-resolution desktop\nenvironments; (ii) a two-stage fine-tuning strategy, where initial\ncross-platform training establishes robust GUI understanding, followed by\nspecialized fine-tuning on high-resolution data to significantly enhance model\nadaptability; and (iii) data curation and redundancy reduction strategies,\ndemonstrating that randomly sampling a smaller subset with reduced redundancy\nachieves performance comparable to larger datasets, emphasizing data diversity\nover sheer volume.

Furthermore, we propose a\ncollaborative learning framework that integrates SSL and TTA models, leveraging\ncontrastive learning and knowledge distillation for stepwise representation\nrefinement. We validate our method on diverse self-supervised models, including\nDINO, MoCo, and iBOT, across TTA benchmarks.

Despite significant progress in this field, current\nmulti-organ segmentation models often suffer from inaccurate details,\ndependence on geometric prompts and loss of spatial information. Addressing\nthese challenges, we introduce a novel model named CRISP-SAM2 with CRoss-modal\nInteraction and Semantic Prompting based on SAM2. This model represents a\npromising approach to multi-organ medical segmentation guided by textual\ndescriptions of organs. Our method begins by converting visual and textual\ninputs into cross-modal contextualized semantics using a progressive\ncross-attention interaction mechanism. These semantics are then injected into\nthe image encoder to enhance the detailed understanding of visual information.\nTo eliminate reliance on geometric prompts, we use a semantic prompting\nstrategy, replacing the original prompt encoder to sharpen the perception of\nchallenging targets. In addition, a similarity-sorting self-updating strategy\nfor memory and a mask-refining process is applied to further adapt to medical\nimaging and enhance localized details. Comparative experiments conducted on\nseven public datasets indicate that CRISP-SAM2 outperforms existing models.\nExtensive analysis also demonstrates the effectiveness of our method, thereby\nconfirming its superior performance, especially in addressing the limitations\nmentioned earlier.

To this end, we\npropose VoteSplat, a novel 3D scene understanding framework that integrates\nHough voting with 3DGS.

Event cameras, with\nmicrosecond temporal resolution and high dynamic range, provide a more\neffective solution for SOD. However, existing event-based object detection\ndatasets are limited in scale, feature large targets size, and lack diverse\nbackgrounds, making them unsuitable for SOD benchmarks.

Existing\napproaches often rely on semantic-level alignment, expecting the model to learn\nnew motion concepts and combine them with other entities (e.g., ''cats'' or\n''dogs'') to produce visually appealing results. However, video data involve\ncomplex spatio-temporal patterns, and focusing solely on semantics cause the\nmodel to overlook the visual complexity of motion. Conversely, tuning only the\nvisual representation leads to semantic confusion in representing the intended\naction. To address these limitations, we propose SynMotion, a new\nmotion-customized video generation model that jointly leverages semantic\nguidance and visual adaptation. At the semantic level, we introduce the\ndual-embedding semantic comprehension mechanism which disentangles subject and\nmotion representations, allowing the model to learn customized motion features\nwhile preserving its generative capabilities for diverse subjects. At the\nvisual level, we integrate parameter-efficient motion adapters into a\npre-trained video generation model to enhance motion fidelity and temporal\ncoherence. Furthermore, we introduce a new embedding-specific training strategy\nwhich \\textbf{alternately optimizes} subject and motion embeddings, supported\nby the manually constructed Subject Prior Video (SPV) training dataset. This\nstrategy promotes motion specificity while preserving generalization across\ndiverse subjects. Lastly, we introduce MotionBench, a newly curated benchmark\nwith diverse motion patterns.

Furthermore, presentation length can also redirect\nattention, as users are more likely to notice longer presentations when\nscrolling through results. Deciding on the document presentation lengths in a\nfixed vertical space ranking is an important problem that has not been\naddressed by existing LTR methods.\n  We address this gap by introducing the variable presentation length ranking\ntask, where simultaneously the ordering of documents and their presentation\nlength is decided. Despite being a generalization of standard ranking, we show\nthat this setting brings significant new challenges: Firstly, the probability\nranking principle no longer applies to this setting, and secondly, the problem\ncannot be divided into separate ordering and length selection tasks.\n  We therefore propose VLPL - a new family of Plackett-Luce list-wise gradient\nestimation methods for the joint optimization of document ordering and lengths.\nOur semi-synthetic experiments show that VLPL can effectively balance the\nexpected exposure and attractiveness of all documents, achieving the best\nperformance across different ranking settings.

Due\nto that, it is unclear where to find their limitations, which is of major\nconcern when using in safety-critical applications. Real-world data does not\nprovide sufficient control, required for a rigorous evaluation of model\ngeneralization. In contrast, synthetically generated data allows to\nsystematically explore the boundaries of model competence/generalization. In\nthis work, we address two research questions: 1) Can we challenge\nopen-vocabulary object detectors with generated image content? 2) Can we find\nsystematic failure modes of those models? To address these questions, we design\ntwo automated pipelines using stable diffusion to inpaint unusual objects with\nhigh diversity in semantics, by sampling multiple substantives from WordNet and\nChatGPT. On the synthetically generated data, we evaluate and compare multiple\nopen-vocabulary object detectors as well as a classical object detector. The\nsynthetic data is derived from two real-world datasets, namely LostAndFound, a\nchallenging out-of-distribution (OOD) detection benchmark, and the NuImages\ndataset.

This makes it highly challenging to achieve high-fidelity\nobject-level modeling while maintaining accurate scene-level representation.\nAddressing this issue is critical for advancing downstream tasks requiring\ndetailed object understanding and appearance modeling. In this paper, we\nintroduce Refine Any object In any ScenE (RAISE), a novel 3D enhancement\nframework that leverages 3D generative priors to recover fine-grained object\ngeometry and appearance under missing views. Starting from substituting\ndegraded objects with proxies, via a 3D generative model with strong 3D\nunderstanding, RAISE progressively refines geometry and texture by aligning\neach proxy to its degraded counterpart in 7-DOF pose, followed by correcting\nspatial and appearance inconsistencies via registration-constrained\nenhancement.

In this work,\nwe first identify a critical issue with existing conditional PT methods: using\nVII as the \"condition\" of prompts yields suboptimal performance, and even\nrandom noise-conditioned prompts can outperform the VII-conditioned\ncounterparts. On further analysis, we find that learning dynamic prompts\nconditioned on Textual Class Information (TCI) is the key to solving the BNT\nproblem. Motivated by this, we then propose Class-adaptive Prompt Tuning\n(CaPT), which enables fast adaptation of tuned models to new classes by\nlearning TCI-conditioned prompts from base classes. Remarkably, CaPT can be\nused as a plugin to mitigate the BNT problem for existing unconditional PT\nschemes.

However, with\nmore bits involved, the associated memory and computation demands escalate to\nthe point where the performance improvements become disproportionate. Based on\nthe insight that different layers demonstrate different importance and extra\nbits could be wasted and interfering, this paper presents an adaptive bit\nallocation strategy for direct-trained SNNs, achieving fine-grained layer-wise\nallocation of memory and computation resources. Thus, SNN's efficiency and\naccuracy can be improved. Specifically, we parametrize the temporal lengths and\nthe bit widths of weights and spikes, and make them learnable and controllable\nthrough gradients. To address the challenges caused by changeable bit widths\nand temporal lengths, we propose the refined spiking neuron, which can handle\ndifferent temporal lengths, enable the derivation of gradients for temporal\nlengths, and suit spike quantization better. In addition, we theoretically\nformulate the step-size mismatch problem of learnable bit widths, which may\nincur severe quantization errors to SNN, and accordingly propose the step-size\nrenewal mechanism to alleviate this issue. Experiments on various datasets,\nincluding the static CIFAR and ImageNet and the dynamic CIFAR-DVS and\nDVS-GESTURE, demonstrate that our methods can reduce the overall memory and\ncomputation cost while achieving higher accuracy.

Our\napproach extracts concepts with their relevance score, computes contrasts for\nsimilar instances, and evaluates the resulting contrastive explanations based\non explanation complexity.

A presentation video of our approach is available at\n  https://youtu.be/_SGNhhNz0fE", "summary": "While recent advances in Gaussian Splatting have enabled fast reconstruction\nof high-quality 3D scenes from images, extracting accurate surface meshes\nremains a challenge. Current approaches extract the surface through costly\npost-processing steps, resulting in the loss of fine geometric details or\nrequiring significant time and leading to very dense meshes with millions of\nvertices. More fundamentally, the a posteriori conversion from a volumetric to\na surface representation limits the ability of the final mesh to preserve all\ngeometric structures captured during training. We present MILo, a novel\nGaussian Splatting framework that bridges the gap between volumetric and\nsurface representations by differentiably extracting a mesh from the 3D\nGaussians. We design a fully differentiable procedure that constructs the\nmesh-including both vertex locations and connectivity-at every iteration\ndirectly from the parameters of the Gaussians, which are the only quantities\noptimized during training. Our method introduces three key technical\ncontributions: a bidirectional consistency framework ensuring both\nrepresentations-Gaussians and the extracted mesh-capture the same underlying\ngeometry during training; an adaptive mesh extraction process performed at each\ntraining iteration, which uses Gaussians as differentiable pivots for Delaunay\ntriangulation; a novel method for computing signed distance values from the 3D\nGaussians that enables precise surface extraction while avoiding geometric\nerosion. Our approach can reconstruct complete scenes, including backgrounds,\nwith state-of-the-art quality while requiring an order of magnitude fewer mesh\nvertices than previous methods.

In many experiments, especially in shock physics, radiography is the\nprimary means of observing the system of interest.

Here\nwe focus on flyer plate impact experiments on porous materials, and resolving\nthe underlying parameterized equation of state (EoS) and crush porosity model\nparameters given radiographic observation(s). We use machine learning as a tool\nto demonstrate with high confidence that using only high impact velocity data\ndoes not provide sufficient information to accurately infer both EoS and crush\nmodel parameters, even with fully resolved density fields or a dynamic sequence\nof images. We thus propose an observable data set consisting of low and high\nimpact velocity experiments/simulations that capture different regimes of\ncompaction and shock propagation, and proceed to introduce a generative machine\nlearning approach which produces a posterior distribution of physical\nparameters directly from radiographs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the\napproach in estimating parameters from simulated flyer plate impact\nexperiments, and show that the obtained estimates of EoS and crush model\nparameters can then be used in hydrodynamic simulations to obtain accurate and\nphysically admissible density reconstructions. Finally, we examine the\nrobustness of the approach to model mismatches, and find that the learned\napproach can provide useful parameter estimates in the presence of\nout-of-distribution radiographic noise and previously unseen physics, thereby\npromoting a potential breakthrough in estimating material properties from\nexperimental radiographic images.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u4f4e\u548c\u9ad8\u51b2\u51fb\u901f\u5ea6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4ece\u5c04\u7ebf\u7167\u7247\u4e2d\u76f4\u63a5\u63a8\u65ad\u6750\u6599\u7684\u7269\u7406\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u83b7\u53d6\u5173\u952e\u72b6\u6001\u53d8\u91cf\uff08\u5982\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff09\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u51b2\u51fb\u7269\u7406\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u5c04\u7ebf\u7167\u7247\u662f\u89c2\u5bdf\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u83b7\u53d6\u5173\u952e\u72b6\u6001\u53d8\u91cf\uff08\u5982\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff09\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4f4e\u548c\u9ad8\u51b2\u51fb\u901f\u5ea6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u5c04\u7ebf\u7167\u7247\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u7269\u7406\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e86\u72b6\u6001\u65b9\u7a0b\u548c\u5b54\u9699\u538b\u7f29\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u5728\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u5bc6\u5ea6\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u5931\u914d\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u672a\u77e5\u7269\u7406\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u4e3a\u4ece\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5c04\u7ebf\u7167\u7247\u4e2d\u4f30\u8ba1\u6750\u6599\u6027\u8d28\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6f5c\u5728\u7a81\u7834\u3002"}}

A major\nchallenge in this task lies in the domain shift caused by variations in imaging\nprotocols, scanners, and patient populations across institutions. To enhance\nthe cross-domain generalization of our model, we incorporate Variance Risk\nExtrapolation (VREx) into the training process. VREx encourages the model to\nmaintain consistent performance across multiple source domains by explicitly\nminimizing the variance of empirical risks across environments. This\nregularization strategy reduces overfitting to center-specific features and\npromotes learning of domain-invariant representations.

To address these limitations, we propose the\ncross-iterative Alignment and Fusion deep Unfolding Network (AFUNet), where HDR\nreconstruction is systematically decoupled into two interleaved subtasks --\nalignment and fusion -- optimized through alternating refinement, achieving\nsynergy between the two subtasks to enhance the overall performance. Our method\nformulates multi-exposure HDR reconstruction from a Maximum A Posteriori (MAP)\nestimation perspective, explicitly incorporating spatial correspondence priors\nacross LDR images and naturally bridging the alignment and fusion subproblems\nthrough joint constraints. Building on the mathematical foundation, we\nreimagine traditional iterative optimization through unfolding -- transforming\nthe conventional solution process into an end-to-end trainable AFUNet with\ncarefully designed modules that work progressively. Specifically, each\niteration of AFUNet incorporates an Alignment-Fusion Module (AFM) that\nalternates between a Spatial Alignment Module (SAM) for alignment and a Channel\nFusion Module (CFM) for adaptive feature fusion, progressively bridging\nmisaligned content and exposure discrepancies.

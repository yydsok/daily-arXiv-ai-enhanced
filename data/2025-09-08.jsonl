Final formatting is yet to be determined", "summary": "Underwater Passive Acoustic Monitoring (UPAM) provides rich spatiotemporal\ndata for long-term ecological analysis, but intrinsic noise and complex signal\ndependencies hinder model stability and generalization. Multilayered windowing\nhas improved target sound localization, yet variability from shifting ambient\nnoise, diverse propagation effects, and mixed biological and anthropogenic\nsources demands robust architectures and rigorous evaluation. We introduce\nGetNetUPAM, a hierarchical nested cross-validation framework designed to\nquantify model stability under ecologically realistic variability. Data are\npartitioned into distinct site-year segments, preserving recording\nheterogeneity and ensuring each validation fold reflects a unique environmental\nsubset, reducing overfitting to localized noise and sensor artifacts. Site-year\nblocking enforces evaluation against genuine environmental diversity, while\nstandard cross-validation on random subsets measures generalization across\nUPAM's full signal distribution, a dimension absent from current benchmarks.\nUsing GetNetUPAM as the evaluation backbone, we propose the Adaptive Resolution\nPooling and Attention Network (ARPA-N), a neural architecture for irregular\nspectrogram dimensions. Adaptive pooling with spatial attention extends the\nreceptive field, capturing global context without excessive parameters. Under\nGetNetUPAM, ARPA-N achieves a 14.4% gain in average precision over DenseNet\nbaselines and a log2-scale order-of-magnitude drop in variability across all\nmetrics, enabling consistent detection across site-year folds and advancing\nscalable, accurate bioacoustic monitoring."}

The\ncontinuous subjective perceived risk ratings showed significant discomfort\nassociated with perceived risk during cornering and braking followed by relief\nor even positive comfort on continuing the ride. The dynamic driving style\ninduced a stronger discomfort as compared to the calm driving style.

Given the current diversity of adversarial patch attacks and\npotential unknown threats, an ideal defense method should be effective,\ngeneralizable, and robust against adaptive attacks. In this work, we introduce\nDISPATCH, the first diffusion-based defense framework for object detection.\nUnlike previous works that aim to \"detect and remove\" adversarial patches,\nDISPATCH adopts a \"regenerate and rectify\" strategy, leveraging generative\nmodels to disarm attack effects while preserving the integrity of the input\nimage. Specifically, we utilize the in-distribution generative power of\ndiffusion models to regenerate the entire image, aligning it with benign data.\nA rectification process is then employed to identify and replace adversarial\nregions with their regenerated benign counterparts. DISPATCH is attack-agnostic\nand requires no prior knowledge of the existing patches. Extensive experiments\nacross multiple detectors and attacks demonstrate that DISPATCH consistently\noutperforms state-of-the-art defenses on both hiding attacks and creating\nattacks, achieving the best overall mAP.5 score of 89.3% on hiding attacks, and\nlowering the attack success rate to 24.8% on untargeted creating attacks.\nMoreover, it maintains strong robustness against adaptive attacks, making it a\npractical and reliable defense for object detection systems."}

Behavioral\nanalysis reveals that language models exhibit key properties associated with\nstrong cooperative strategies - niceness, provocability, and generosity while\nalso demonstrating rapid adaptability to changes in opponent strategy mid-game.\nIn controlled \"strategy switch\" experiments, language models detect and respond\nto shifts within only a few rounds, rivaling or surpassing human adaptability.\nThese results provide the first systematic characterization of long-term\ncooperative behaviors in language model agents, offering a foundation for\nfuture research into their role in more complex, mixed human-AI social\nenvironments."}

In this work, we investigate\n\\emph{when} representations for new tasks are formed in language models, and\n\\emph{how} these representations change over the course of context. We focus on\n''transferrable'' task representations -- vector representations that can\nrestore task context in another instance of the model, even without the full\nprompt. We show that these representations evolve in non-monotonic and sporadic\nways, and are distinct from a more inert representation of high-level task\ncategories that persists throughout the context. Specifically, models often\ncondense multiple evidence into these transferrable task representations, which\nalign well with the performance improvement based on more examples in the\ncontext. However, this accrual process exhibits strong locality along the\nsequence dimension, coming online only at certain tokens -- despite task\nidentity being reliably decodable throughout the context. Moreover, these local\nbut transferrable task representations tend to capture minimal ''task scopes'',\nsuch as a semantically-independent subtask, and models rely on more\ntemporally-distributed representations to support longer and composite tasks.\nThis two-fold locality (temporal and semantic) underscores a kind of\njust-in-time computational process underlying language models' ability to adapt\nto new evidence and learn new tasks on the fly."}

It can precede critical regime shifts that are\nhighly impactful but difficult to predict. Here we show that convolutional long\nshort-term memory (CNN LSTM) models, trained on synthetic time series generated\nfrom simple polynomial functions with additive noise, can accurately identify\nflickering patterns. Despite being trained on simplified dynamics, our models\ngeneralize to diverse stochastic systems and reliably detect flickering in\nempirical datasets, including dormouse body temperature records and\npalaeoclimate proxies from the African Humid Period. These findings demonstrate\nthat deep learning can extract early warning signals from noisy, nonlinear time\nseries, providing a flexible framework for identifying instability across a\nwide range of dynamical systems."}

Map conflation\nis the process of augmentation of a GDB using another GDB to conflate missing\nspatial features. Existing map conflation methods suffer from two main\nlimitations: (1) They are designed for the conflation of linear objects (e.g.,\nroad networks) and cannot simply be extended to non-linear objects, thus\nmissing information about most entities in the map. (2) They are heuristic\nalgorithmic approaches that are based on pre-defined rules, unable to learn\nentities matching in a data-driven manner. To address these limitations, we\ndesign KRAFT, a learning based approach consisting of three parts: (1)\nKnowledge Graph Construction - where each GDB is represented by a knowledge\ngraph, (2) Map Matching - where we use a knowledge graph alignment method as\nwell as a geospatial feature encoder to match entities in obtained knowledge\ngraphs, and (3) Map Merging - where we merge matched entities in the previous\nmodules in a consistent manner, using a mixed integer linear programming\nformulation that fully merges the GDBs without adding any inconsistencies.

Recognizing that accurate\nuncertainty quantification of the perception module is essential for safe\nfeedback control, our approach departs from the conventional assumption of\nzero-mean noise quantification of the perception error. Instead, it employs\nset-based state estimation with constrained zonotopes to capture biased,\nheavy-tailed uncertainties while maintaining bounded estimation errors. To\nimprove computational efficiency, the robust MPC is reformulated as a linear\nprogram (LP), using a Minkowski-Lyapunov-based cost function with an added\nslack variable to prevent degenerate solutions. Closed-loop stability is\nensured through Minkowski-Lyapunov inequalities and contractive zonotopic\ninvariant sets.

We argue that first-order\noptimizers exhibit an intrinsic frequency preference that significantly\nreshapes the optimization path. To address this, we propose Natural Spectral\nFusion (NSF): reframing training as controllable spectral coverage and\ninformation fusion rather than merely scaling step sizes. NSF has two core\nprinciples: treating the optimizer as a spectral controller that dynamically\nbalances low- and high-frequency information; and periodically reweighting\nfrequency bands at negligible cost, without modifying the model, data, or\ntraining pipeline. We realize NSF via a p-exponent extension of the\nsecond-moment term, enabling both positive and negative exponents, and\nimplement it through cyclic scheduling. Theory and experiments show that\nadaptive methods emphasize low frequencies, SGD is near-neutral, and negative\nexponents amplify high-frequency information. Cyclic scheduling broadens\nspectral coverage, improves cross-band fusion, and induces early\ndecision-boundary alignment, where accuracy improves even while loss remains\nhigh. Across multiple benchmarks, with identical learning-rate strategies and\nfixed hyperparameters, p-exponent cyclic scheduling consistently reduces test\nerror and demonstrates distinct convergence behavior; on some tasks, it matches\nbaseline accuracy with only one-quarter of the training cost.

While recent computer vision methods have\nenabled flood detection, they suffer from both accuracy limitations and poor\ngeneralization due to dependence on fixed object detectors and task-specific\ntraining. To enable accurate depth estimation that can generalize across\ndiverse flood scenarios, this paper presents FloodVision, a zero-shot framework\nthat combines the semantic reasoning abilities of the foundation\nvision-language model GPT-4o with a structured domain knowledge graph. The\nknowledge graph encodes canonical real-world dimensions for common urban\nobjects including vehicles, people, and infrastructure elements to ground the\nmodel's reasoning in physical reality. FloodVision dynamically identifies\nvisible reference objects in RGB images, retrieves verified heights from the\nknowledge graph to mitigate hallucination, estimates submergence ratios, and\napplies statistical outlier filtering to compute final depth values. Evaluated\non 110 crowdsourced images from MyCoast New York, FloodVision achieves a mean\nabsolute error of 8.17 cm, reducing the GPT-4o baseline 10.28 cm by 20.5% and\nsurpassing prior CNN-based methods.

This position paper argues that the next frontier in\ndeveloping capable agents lies in creating environments that possess an\nexplicit, hierarchical World Model. We contend that this is best achieved\nthrough hierarchical scaffolding, where complex goals are decomposed into\nstructured, manageable subgoals. Drawing evidence from a systematic review of\n2024 research in multi-agent soccer, we identify a clear and decisive trend\ntowards integrating symbolic and hierarchical methods with multi-agent\nreinforcement learning (MARL). These approaches implicitly or explicitly\nconstruct a task-based world model to guide agent learning. We then propose a\nparadigm shift: leveraging Large Language Models to dynamically generate this\nhierarchical scaffold, effectively using language to structure the World Model\non the fly. This language-driven world model provides an intrinsic curriculum,\ndense and meaningful learning signals, and a framework for compositional\nlearning, enabling Agent Models to acquire sophisticated, strategic behaviors\nwith far greater sample efficiency. By building environments with explicit,\nlanguage-configurable task layers, we can bridge the gap between low-level\nreactive behaviors and high-level strategic team play, creating a powerful and\ngeneralizable framework for training the next generation of intelligent agents."}

Instead, we\ndemonstrate that a low-rank structure naturally emerges in the shifted\nsuccessor measure, which captures the system dynamics after bypassing a few\ninitial transitions. We provide finite-sample performance guarantees for the\nentry-wise estimation of a low-rank approximation of the shifted successor\nmeasure from sampled entries.

The proposed action selection\nmodule provides a calibrated Q-value, which mitigates the bootstrapping error\nthat otherwise leads to inefficient exploration. Furthermore, to prevent the RL\npolicy from converging to a sub-optimal policy, SAC is used as the RL policy\ninstead of TD3. The effectiveness of our method in mitigating bootstrapping\nerror and preventing overfitting is empirically validated by learning two\nrobotics tasks: bucket loading and open drawer, which require extensive\ninteractions with the environment. Simulation results also demonstrate the\nrobustness of the DRLR framework across tasks with both low and high\nstate-action dimensions, and varying demonstration qualities.

This study aims to explore key concepts of using LLMs for\nclinical concept and relation extraction tasks, including: (1) encoder-only or\ndecoder-only LLMs, (2) prompt-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)\nalgorithms, and (3) multi-task instruction tuning on few-shot learning\nperformance. We benchmarked a suite of LLMs, including encoder-based LLMs\n(BERT, GatorTron) and decoder-based LLMs (GatorTronGPT, Llama 3.1,\nGatorTronLlama), across five datasets. We compared traditional full-size\nfine-tuning and prompt-based PEFT. We explored a multi-task instruction tuning\nframework that combines both tasks across four datasets to evaluate the\nzero-shot and few-shot learning performance using the leave-one-dataset-out\nstrategy."}

Moreover,\nintegrating a modality into a pre-existing foundation model currently requires\na significant amount of paired data, which is often not available for\nlow-resource modalities. In this paper, we introduce a method for\nsample-efficient modality integration (SEMI) into Large Language Models (LLMs).\nTo this end, we devise a hypernetwork that can adapt a shared projector --\nplaced between modality-specific encoders and an LLM -- to any modality. The\nhypernetwork, trained on high-resource modalities (i.e., text, speech, audio,\nvideo), is conditioned on a few samples from any arbitrary modality at\ninference time to generate a suitable adapter. To increase the diversity of\ntraining modalities, we artificially multiply the number of encoders through\nisometric transformations. We find that SEMI achieves a significant boost in\nsample efficiency during few-shot integration of new modalities (i.e.,\nsatellite images, astronomical images, inertial measurements, and molecules)\nwith encoders of arbitrary embedding dimensionality.

For each environment, we formalize the state and action spaces, the\nsensory encoding and motor decoding mechanisms, and the feedback protocols\nbased on predictable (reward) and unpredictable (punishment) stimulation.\nFurthermore, we propose a novel meta-learning approach where a Large Language\nModel (LLM) is used to automate the generation and optimization of experimental\nprotocols, scaling the process of environment and curriculum design. Finally,\nwe outline a multi-modal approach for evaluating learning by measuring synaptic\nplasticity at electrophysiological, cellular, and molecular levels. This work\nbridges the gap between computational neuroscience and agent-based AI, offering\na unique platform for studying embodiment, learning, and intelligence in a\ncontrolled biological substrate."}

To address these limitations, we\nintroduce techniques that enhance the quality of 3D stylization while\nmaintaining view consistency and providing optional region-controlled style\ntransfer.

In domains such as robotic soccer, agents\ntrained via standard reinforcement learning in high-fidelity but\nstructurally-flat simulators often fail due to intractable exploration spaces\nand sparse rewards.

Leveraging two publicly available\nservice interaction datasets, we benchmark several state-of-the-art language\nmodels, including a fine-tuned T5 variant, across both paradigms: Intent-First\nResponse Generation and Direct Response Generation. Evaluation metrics\nencompass both linguistic quality and task success rates, revealing surprising\ninsights into the necessity or redundancy of explicit intent modelling. Our\nfindings challenge conventional assumptions in conversational AI pipelines,\noffering actionable guidelines for designing more efficient and effective\nresponse generation systems."}

We\ninvestigate this question by giving models the option to bail out of\ninteractions using three different bail methods: a bail tool the model can\ncall, a bail string the model can output, and a bail prompt that asks the model\nif it wants to leave. On continuations of real world data (Wildchat and\nShareGPT), all three of these bail methods find models will bail around\n0.28-32\\% of the time (depending on the model and bail method). However, we\nfind that bail rates can depend heavily on the model used for the transcript,\nwhich means we may be overestimating real world bail rates by up to 4x. If we\nalso take into account false positives on bail prompt (22\\%), we estimate real\nworld bail rates range from 0.06-7\\%, depending on the model and bail method.\nWe use observations from our continuations of real world data to construct a\nnon-exhaustive taxonomy of bail cases, and use this taxonomy to construct\nBailBench: a representative synthetic dataset of situations where some models\nbail. We test many models on this dataset, and observe some bail behavior\noccurring for most of them. Bail rates vary substantially between models, bail\nmethods, and prompt wordings. Finally, we study the relationship between\nrefusals and bails. We find: 1) 0-13\\% of continuations of real world\nconversations resulted in a bail without a corresponding refusal 2) Jailbreaks\ntend to decrease refusal rates, but increase bail rates 3) Refusal abliteration\nincreases no-refuse bail rates, but only for some bail methods 4) Refusal rate\non BailBench does not appear to predict bail rate."}

We systematically delineate the\ndesign space of decay mechanisms across four pivotal dimensions:\nparameterization strategy, which refers to the computational methodology for\ndecay; parameter sharing, which involves the utilization of supplementary\nparameters for decay computation; decay granularity, comparing scalar versus\nvector-based decay; and compatibility with relative positional encoding\nmethods, such as Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE). Through an extensive series\nof experiments conducted on diverse language modeling tasks, we uncovered\nseveral critical insights. Firstly, the design of the parameterization strategy\nfor decay requires meticulous consideration. Our findings indicate that\neffective configurations are typically confined to a specific range of\nparameters. Secondly, parameter sharing cannot be used arbitrarily, as it may\ncause decay values to be too large or too small, thereby significantly\nimpacting performance. Thirdly, under identical parameterization strategies,\nscalar decay generally underperforms compared to its vector-based counterpart.\nHowever, in certain scenarios with alternative parameterization strategies,\nscalar decay may unexpectedly surpass vector decay in efficacy. Lastly, our\nanalysis reveals that RoPE, a commonly employed relative positional encoding\nmethod, typically fails to provide tangible benefits to the majority of linear\nattention mechanisms."}

Among various SGPs, our paper\nsticks to scalable vector graphics (SVGs). We begin by examining the extent to\nwhich LLMs can generate SGPs. To this end, we introduce SGP-GenBench, a\ncomprehensive benchmark covering object fidelity, scene fidelity, and\ncompositionality (attribute binding, spatial relations, numeracy). On\nSGP-GenBench, we discover that frontier proprietary models substantially\noutperform open-source models, and performance correlates well with general\ncoding capabilities. Motivated by this gap, we aim to improve LLMs' ability to\ngenerate SGPs. We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards\napproach, where a format-validity gate ensures renderable SVG, and a\ncross-modal reward aligns text and the rendered image via strong vision\nencoders (e.g., SigLIP for text-image and DINO for image-image).

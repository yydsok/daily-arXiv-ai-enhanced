Motivated by the\nrecognition that, in fluid mechanics, an understanding of the underlying flow\nphysics is as crucial as accurate prediction, this study applies SR to model a\nfundamental three-dimensional (3D) incompressible flow in a rectangular\nchannel, focusing on the (axial) velocity and pressure fields under laminar\nconditions. By employing the PySR library, compact symbolic equations were\nderived directly from numerical simulation data, revealing key characteristics\nof the flow dynamics. These equations not only approximate the parabolic\nvelocity profile and pressure drop observed in the studied fluid flow, but also\nperfectly coincide with analytical solutions from the literature. Furthermore,\nwe propose an innovative approach that integrates SR with the\nknowledge-representation framework of Answer Set Programming (ASP), combining\nthe generative power of SR with the declarative reasoning strengths of ASP. The\nproposed hybrid SR/ASP framework ensures that the SR-generated symbolic\nexpressions are not only statistically accurate, but also physically plausible,\nadhering to domain-specific principles. Overall, the study highlights two key\ncontributions: SR's ability to simplify complex flow behaviours into concise,\ninterpretable equations, and the potential of knowledge-representation\napproaches to improve the reliability and alignment of data-driven SR models\nwith domain principles. Insights from the examined 3D channel flow pave the way\nfor integrating such hybrid approaches into efficient frameworks, [...] where\nexplainable predictions and real-time data analysis are crucial."}

Therefore, employing\nQuantization-Aware Training (QAT) on edge devices has become an effective\nsolution. Nevertheless, traditional QAT relies on the complete dataset for\ntraining, which incurs a huge computational cost. Coreset selection techniques\ncan mitigate this issue by training on the most representative subsets.\nHowever, existing methods struggle to eliminate quantization errors in the\nmodel when using small-scale datasets (e.g., only 10% of the data), leading to\nsignificant performance degradation. To address these issues, we propose QuaRC,\na QAT framework with coresets on edge devices, which consists of two main\nphases: In the coreset selection phase, QuaRC introduces the ``Relative Entropy\nScore\" to identify the subsets that most effectively capture the model's\nquantization errors.

This\nsensitivity to item positioning in a LLM's prompt is known as position bias.\nPrior research shows that this bias exists even in large models, though its\nseverity varies across models and tasks. In addition to position bias, LLMs\nalso exhibit varying degrees of low repetition consistency, where repeating the\nLLM call with the same candidate ordering can lead to different rankings. To\naddress both inconsistencies, a common approach is to prompt the model multiple\ntimes with different candidate orderings and aggregate the results via majority\nvoting.

Extending prior findings, we observe that both the\ndirection -- favoring either the earlier or later candidate in the prompt --\nand magnitude of position bias across instances vary substantially, even within\na single dataset.

GrAInS\nuses contrastive, gradient-based attribution via Integrated Gradients to\nidentify the top-k most influential tokens, both positively and negatively\nattributed based on their contribution to preferred versus dispreferred\noutputs. These tokens are then used to construct directional steering vectors\nthat capture semantic shifts from undesirable to desirable behavior.

In this paper, we propose VLM-IMI, a novel\nframework that leverages large vision-language models (VLMs) with iterative and\nmanual instructions (IMIs) for LLIE. VLM-IMI incorporates textual descriptions\nof the desired normal-light content as enhancement cues, enabling semantically\ninformed restoration. To effectively integrate cross-modal priors, we introduce\nan instruction prior fusion module, which dynamically aligns and fuses image\nand text features, promoting the generation of detailed and semantically\ncoherent outputs. During inference, we adopt an iterative and manual\ninstruction strategy to refine textual instructions, progressively improving\nvisual quality. This refinement enhances structural fidelity, semantic\nalignment, and the recovery of fine details under extremely low-light\nconditions.

Specifically, we developed PathoROB,\na robustness benchmark with three novel metrics, including the robustness\nindex, and four datasets covering 28 biological classes from 34 medical\ncenters. Our experiments reveal robustness deficits across all 20 evaluated\nFMs, and substantial robustness differences between them. We found that\nnon-robust FM representations can cause major diagnostic downstream errors and\nclinical blunders that prevent safe clinical adoption. Using more robust FMs\nand post-hoc robustification considerably reduced (but did not yet eliminate)\nthe risk of such errors. This work establishes that robustness evaluation is\nessential for validating pathology FMs before clinical adoption and\ndemonstrates that future FM development must integrate robustness as a core\ndesign principle. PathoROB provides a blueprint for assessing robustness across\nbiomedical domains, guiding FM improvement efforts towards more robust,\nrepresentative, and clinically deployable AI systems that prioritize biological\ninformation over technical artifacts."}

However,\nsuch methods typically necessitate computationally expensive sampling,\ninvolving multiple forward passes to effectively estimate predictive\nuncertainty.\n  In this paper, we introduce a novel approach enabling efficient and effective\nuncertainty estimation in LLMs without sacrificing performance. Specifically,\nwe distill uncertainty-aware teacher models - originally requiring multiple\nforward passes - into compact student models sharing the same architecture but\nfine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). We compare two distinct\ndistillation strategies: one in which the student employs traditional\nsoftmax-based outputs, and another in which the student leverages\nDirichlet-distributed outputs to explicitly model epistemic uncertainty via\nevidential learning.\n  Empirical evaluations on classification datasets demonstrate that such\nstudents can achieve comparable or superior predictive and uncertainty\nquantification performance relative to their teacher models, while critically\nrequiring only a single forward pass. To our knowledge, this is the first\ndemonstration that immediate and robust uncertainty quantification can be\nachieved in LLMs through evidential distillation."}

We validate the functionality and efficiency of\nthe proposed strategies by applying the improved GA model to synthetic\ndatasets. Experimental results show that our implementation improves the\nprediction accuracy and inference speed of GA compared to the original\nimplementation. Moreover, explanation experiments indicate that GA can\neffectively captures the inherent spatial effects in the designed synthetic\ndataset. The complete pipeline has been made publicly available for community\nuse (https://github.com/ruid7181/GA-sklearn)."}

Recent state-of-the-art developments in SSL for video data include\nV-JEPA, a framework solely based on feature prediction, avoiding pixel level\nreconstruction or negative samples.

On the public Endoscopic Ultrasound Database of the Pancreas,\nTextSAM-EUS with automatic prompts attains 82.69% Dice and 85.28% normalized\nsurface distance (NSD), and with manual geometric prompts reaches 83.10% Dice\nand 85.70% NSD, outperforming both existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) supervised\nDL models and foundation models (e.g., SAM and its variants). As the first\nattempt to incorporate prompt learning in SAM-based medical image segmentation,\nTextSAM-EUS offers a practical option for efficient and robust automatic EUS\nsegmentation.

As a result, simply classifying workloads as latency-sensitive\n(LS) or best-effort (BE) overlooks the nuances within the latency-sensitive\ncategory and results in suboptimal user experiences and scheduling\nopportunities. However, efficiently serving requests with multiple SLO\nrequirements poses significant challenges. First, all requests within a batch\ngenerate new tokens simultaneously, which can misalign them with their distinct\nSLO requirements. Moreover, while existing systems focus on auto-scaling for\nhandling various overall request rates, the diversity of SLOs necessitates\nfine-grained auto-scaling among these SLO tiers. Finally, unlike LS/BE\nscenarios, where BE requests can be aborted at any time to ensure the SLO\nattainment of LS requests, those with different latency-sensitive SLOs cannot\ntolerate prolonged delays, and tail latency must be controlled.\n  To tackle these challenges, we propose PolyServe, a novel multi-SLO\nscheduling policy at scale that maintains high SLO attainment while maximizing\nthroughput. PolyServe first groups requests into multiple bins based on their\nper-token latency requirement, then schedules each bin to a subset of the\nserver fleet. PolyServe routes requests to the highest-load but still\nSLO-attainable server to create a load gradient that facilitates auto-scaling.\nTo increase utilization, PolyServe permits looser-SLO requests to share\ntighter-SLO instances when their own servers are saturated. PolyServe uses\nprofiling data to guide scheduling decisions and manage tail latency through\nrequest-wait-time-aware scheduling, dynamic chunking, and continuous chunked\nprefill prediction.

The\nmodel achieves an accuracy of 0.392229, a recall of 0.392229, and a F1-score of\n0.392229, indicating a consistent ability to correctly identify instances under\nthe target condition. Notably, our model exhibits perfect specificity of\n0.898704, showing an exceptional capacity to correctly classify negative cases.\nMoreover, a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.255267 is calculated,\nto signify a limited positive correlation between predicted and actual values\nand highlight our model's overall predictive power.

These key\ntokens are then masked, and their probabilities are checked via a Masked\nLanguage Model (MLM). Since injected tokens typically exhibit markedly low\nmasked-token probabilities, this enables GMTP to easily detect malicious\ndocuments and achieve high-precision filtering.

Furthermore, we propose a penalty-based proximal\nalternating linearized minimization (PALM) algorithm and provide a rigorous\nconvergence analysis under mild assumptions, overcoming the lack of coercivity\nin the objective function. The proposed method admits efficient solvers for all\nsubproblems and guarantees global convergence to critical points. Our results\nfill a key gap in the literature by enabling the direct design of group-sparse\nfeedback gains with theoretical guarantees, without resorting to convex\nsurrogates or restrictive structural assumptions."}

However, due to privacy concerns, certain sensitive\ndata can only be processed on edge devices. Therefore, employing\nQuantization-Aware Training (QAT) on edge devices has become an effective\nsolution. Nevertheless, traditional QAT relies on the complete dataset for\ntraining, which incurs a huge computational cost. Coreset selection techniques\ncan mitigate this issue by training on the most representative subsets.\nHowever, existing methods struggle to eliminate quantization errors in the\nmodel when using small-scale datasets (e.g., only 10% of the data), leading to\nsignificant performance degradation. To address these issues, we propose QuaRC,\na QAT framework with coresets on edge devices, which consists of two main\nphases: In the coreset selection phase, QuaRC introduces the ``Relative Entropy\nScore\" to identify the subsets that most effectively capture the model's\nquantization errors. During the training phase, QuaRC employs the Cascaded\nLayer Correction strategy to align the intermediate layer outputs of the\nquantized model with those of the full-precision model, thereby effectively\nreducing the quantization errors in the intermediate layers. Experimental\nresults demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. For instance, when\nquantizing ResNet-18 to 2-bit using a 1% data subset, QuaRC achieves a 5.72%\nimprovement in Top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet-1K dataset compared to\nstate-of-the-art techniques."}

To address these\nlimitations, we introduce GrAInS, an inference-time steering approach that\noperates across both language-only and vision-language models and tasks. GrAInS\nuses contrastive, gradient-based attribution via Integrated Gradients to\nidentify the top-k most influential tokens, both positively and negatively\nattributed based on their contribution to preferred versus dispreferred\noutputs. These tokens are then used to construct directional steering vectors\nthat capture semantic shifts from undesirable to desirable behavior. During\ninference, GrAInS adjusts hidden activations at transformer layers guided by\ntoken-level attribution signals, and normalizes activations to preserve\nrepresentational scale. This enables fine-grained, interpretable, and modular\ncontrol over model behavior, without retraining or auxiliary supervision.\nEmpirically, GrAInS consistently outperforms both fine-tuning and existing\nsteering baselines: it achieves a 13.22% accuracy gain on TruthfulQA using\nLlama-3.1-8B, reduces hallucination rates on MMHal-Bench from 0.624 to 0.514\nwith LLaVA-1.6-7B, and improves alignment win rates on SPA-VL by 8.11%, all\nwhile preserving the model's fluency and general capabilities."}

Concept probing works by training additional\nclassifiers to map the internal representations of a model into human-defined\nconcepts of interest, thus allowing humans to peek inside artificial neural\nnetworks. Research on concept probing has mainly focused on the model being\nprobed or the probing model itself, paying limited attention to the data\nrequired to train such probing models. In this paper, we address this gap.\nFocusing on concept probing in the context of image classification tasks, we\ninvestigate the effect of the data used to train probing models on their\nperformance.

We propose a transformer-based foundation model for mMIMO\nprecoding that seeks to minimize the energy consumption of the transmitter\nwhile dynamically adapting to per-user rate requirements. At equal energy\nconsumption, zero-shot deployment of the proposed foundation model\nsignificantly outperforms zero forcing, and approaches weighted minimum mean\nsquared error performance with 8x less complexity. To address model adaptation\nin data-scarce settings, we introduce a data augmentation method that finds\ntraining samples similar to the target distribution by computing the cosine\nsimilarity between the outputs of the pre-trained feature extractor. Our work\nenables the implementation of DL-based solutions in practice by addressing\nchallenges of data availability and training complexity.

Existing VCM methods often bind codecs to\nspecific downstream models, requiring retraining or supervised data and thus\nlimiting generalization in multi-task scenarios. Recently, unified VCM\nframeworks have employed visual backbones (VB) and visual foundation models\n(VFM) to support multiple video understanding tasks with a single codec. They\nmainly utilize VB/VFM to maintain semantic consistency or suppress non-semantic\ninformation, but seldom explore how to directly link video coding with\nunderstanding under VB/VFM guidance. Hence, we propose a Symmetric\nEntropy-Constrained Video Coding framework for Machines (SEC-VCM). It\nestablishes a symmetric alignment between the video codec and VB, allowing the\ncodec to leverage VB's representation capabilities to preserve semantics and\ndiscard MVS-irrelevant information. Specifically, a bi-directional\nentropy-constraint (BiEC) mechanism ensures symmetry between the process of\nvideo decoding and VB encoding by suppressing conditional entropy. This helps\nthe codec to explicitly handle semantic information beneficial for MVS while\nsqueezing useless information. Furthermore, a semantic-pixel dual-path fusion\n(SPDF) module injects pixel-level priors into the final reconstruction. Through\nsemantic-pixel fusion, it suppresses artifacts harmful to MVS and improves\nmachine-oriented reconstruction quality. Experimental results show our\nframework achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) in rate-task performance, with\nsignificant bitrate savings over VTM on video instance segmentation (37.41%),\nvideo object segmentation (29.83%), object detection (46.22%), and multiple\nobject tracking (44.94%).

As a result, LM performance on reasoning under uncertainty remains\npoorly characterized. To address this gap, we introduce OpenEstimate, an\nextensible, multi-domain benchmark for evaluating LMs on numerical estimation\ntasks that require models to synthesize significant amounts of background\ninformation and express predictions as probabilistic priors. We assess these\npriors for accuracy and calibration, quantifying their usefulness relative to\nsamples from the true distribution of interest.

C51 is a popular DRL\nalgorithm for discrete action spaces. It uses a Q-learning approach, where the\ndistribution is learned using a greedy Bellman update.

Recent alternatives such as Direct Preference\nOptimization (DPO) simplify this pipeline by directly optimizing on\npreferences. However, both approaches often assume uniform annotator\npreferences and rely on binary comparisons, overlooking two key limitations:\nthe diversity of human evaluators and the limitations of pairwise feedback. In\nthis work, we address both these issues. First, we connect preference learning\nin RLHF with the econometrics literature and show that binary comparisons are\ninsufficient for identifying latent user preferences from finite user data and\ninfinite users, while (even incomplete) rankings over three or more responses\nensure identifiability. Second, we introduce methods to incorporate\nheterogeneous preferences into alignment algorithms. We develop an\nExpectation-Maximization adaptation of DPO that discovers latent annotator\ntypes and trains a mixture of LLMs accordingly. Then we propose an aggregation\nalgorithm using a min-max regret fairness criterion to produce a single\ngenerative policy with equitable performance guarantees. Together, these\ncontributions establish a theoretical and algorithmic framework for fairness\nand personalization for diverse users in generative model alignment."}

This raises a fundamental\nquestion: what microscopic property of pre-trained models leads to this\nvariation? To investigate, we formalize reasoning as chains of Horn clauses\n(\"if-then\" rules) built from features extracted from the LLM's latent space via\ncross-layer sparse autoencoders (SAEs). We estimate the transition\nprobabilities between its features, and further categorize each rule by its\nsemantic soundness level (e.g., strict, plausible, noisy) with an LLM. Our key\ndiscovery is that high-potential models are inherently soundness-aware: their\ninternal probability distributions systematically shift across rules' soundness\nlevels, becoming highly distinct for \"strict\" versus \"noisy\" rules. In\ncontrast, weaker models are soundness-agnostic, collapsing to one distribution\nregardless of soundness levels. To quantify this, we introduce the\nSoundness-Aware Level (SAL), a microscopic metric using the Jensen-Shannon\nDivergence to measure the separation between these distributions. We show that\nSAL's predictions of post-RLVR reasoning performance follow a precise empirical\nlaw (R^2=0.87) across diverse model families (Qwen, Mistral, Llama, DeepSeek)\nand scales (0.5B-14B).

Yet its potential is underutilized in\nspatiotemporal Earth observation, where models often depend on purely\ncorrelational features that fail to transfer across heterogeneous domains. We\npropose RIC-TSC, a regionally-informed causal time-series classification\nframework that embeds lag-aware causal discovery directly into sequence\nmodeling, enabling both predictive accuracy and scientific interpretability.\nUsing multi-modal satellite and reanalysis data-including Sentinel-1 microwave\nbackscatter, Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 optical reflectance, and CARRA\nmeteorological variables-we leverage Joint PCMCI+ (J-PCMCI+) to identify\nregion-specific and invariant predictors of supraglacial lake evolution in\nGreenland. Causal graphs are estimated globally and per basin, with validated\npredictors and their time lags supplied to lightweight classifiers. On a\nbalanced benchmark of 1000 manually labeled lakes from two contrasting melt\nseasons (2018-2019), causal models achieve up to 12.59% higher accuracy than\ncorrelation-based baselines under out-of-distribution evaluation.

To investigate, we formalize reasoning as chains of Horn clauses\n(\"if-then\" rules) built from features extracted from the LLM's latent space via\ncross-layer sparse autoencoders (SAEs). We estimate the transition\nprobabilities between its features, and further categorize each rule by its\nsemantic soundness level (e.g., strict, plausible, noisy) with an LLM. Our key\ndiscovery is that high-potential models are inherently soundness-aware: their\ninternal probability distributions systematically shift across rules' soundness\nlevels, becoming highly distinct for \"strict\" versus \"noisy\" rules. In\ncontrast, weaker models are soundness-agnostic, collapsing to one distribution\nregardless of soundness levels. To quantify this, we introduce the\nSoundness-Aware Level (SAL), a microscopic metric using the Jensen-Shannon\nDivergence to measure the separation between these distributions.

While this choice is intensely debated, its\nunderlying economic drivers remain underexplored. We construct a two-period\ngame-theoretic model to analyze how openness shapes competition in an AI value\nchain, featuring an incumbent developer, a downstream deployer, and an entrant\ndeveloper. Openness exerts a dual effect: it amplifies knowledge spillovers to\nthe entrant, but it also enhances the incumbent's advantage through a \"data\nflywheel effect,\" whereby greater user engagement today further lowers the\ndeployer's future fine-tuning cost. Our analysis reveals that the incumbent's\noptimal first-period openness is surprisingly non-monotonic in the strength of\nthe data flywheel effect. When the data flywheel effect is either weak or very\nstrong, the incumbent prefers a higher level of openness; however, for an\nintermediate range, it strategically restricts openness to impair the entrant's\nlearning. This dynamic gives rise to an \"openness trap,\" a critical policy\nparadox where transparency mandates can backfire by removing firms' strategic\nflexibility, reducing investment, and lowering welfare. We extend the model to\nshow that other common interventions can be similarly ineffective. Vertical\nintegration, for instance, only benefits the ecosystem when the data flywheel\neffect is strong enough to overcome the loss of a potentially more efficient\ncompetitor. Likewise, government subsidies intended to spur adoption can be\ncaptured entirely by the incumbent through strategic price and openness\nadjustments, leaving the rest of the value chain worse off. By modeling the\ndeveloper's strategic response to competitive and regulatory pressures, we\nprovide a robust framework for analyzing competition and designing effective\npolicy in the complex and rapidly evolving FM ecosystem."}

We introduce a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN)\nframework, governed by the Navier Cauchy equations, to enforce physical laws.\nCrucially, we demonstrate that a curriculum learning strategy, pretraining on\ndata followed by physics informed fine tuning, is essential for stabilizing\ntraining. Our results show that GNNs fundamentally outperform the U-Net. Even\nthe worst performer among GNNs, the GCN framework, achieved a relative L2 error\nof 8.7% while the best framework among U Net, U Net with attention mechanism\ntrained on high resolution data, achieved 13.0% score. Among the graph-based\narchitectures, the Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNN) and Graph\nTransformers achieved the highest accuracy, achieving a relative L2 score of\n3.5% and 2.6% respectively. The inclusion of physics fundamental laws (PINN)\nsignificantly improved the generalization, reducing error by up to 11.3% on\nhigh-signal tasks. While the Graph Transformer is the most accurate model, it\nis more 37.5% slower during inference when compared to second best model, MPNN\nPINN. The PINN enhanced MPNN (MPNN PINN) provides the most practical solution.\nIt offers a good compromise between predictive performance, model size, and\ninference speed."}

These methods have been shown to generally lead to\ninconsistent or suboptimal results, as they do not directly maximize\nsegmentation metrics. To address this issue, a novel consistent segmentation\nframework, RankSEG, has been proposed, which includes RankDice and RankIoU\nspecifically designed to optimize the Dice and IoU metrics, respectively.\nAlthough RankSEG almost guarantees improved performance, it suffers from two\nmajor drawbacks. First, it is its computational expense-RankDice has a\ncomplexity of O(d log d) with a substantial constant factor (where d represents\nthe number of pixels), while RankIoU exhibits even higher complexity O(d^2),\nthus limiting its practical application. For instance, in LiTS, prediction with\nRankSEG takes 16.33 seconds compared to just 0.01 seconds with the argmax rule.\nSecond, RankSEG is only applicable to overlapping segmentation settings, where\nmultiple classes can occupy the same pixel, which contrasts with standard\nbenchmarks that typically assume non-overlapping segmentation. In this paper,\nwe overcome these two drawbacks via a reciprocal moment approximation (RMA) of\nRankSEG with the following contributions: (i) we improve RankSEG using RMA,\nnamely RankSEG-RMA, reduces the complexity of both algorithms to O(d) while\nmaintaining comparable performance; (ii) inspired by RMA, we develop a\npixel-wise score function that allows efficient implementation for\nnon-overlapping segmentation settings."}

A prevalent approach\nwithin the field is sampling-based test-time scaling methods, which enhance\nreasoning by generating multiple reasoning paths for a given input during\ninference. However, despite its practical success, the theoretical foundations\nremain underexplored. In this paper, we provide the first theoretical framework\nfor analyzing sampling-based test-time scaling methods, grounded in the\nperspective of confidence estimation. Based on the framework, we analyze two\ndominant paradigms: self-consistency and perplexity, and reveal key\nlimitations: self-consistency suffers from high estimation error while\nperplexity exhibits substantial modeling error and possible degradation of the\nestimation error convergence. To address these limitations, we introduce RPC, a\nhybrid method that leverages our theoretical insights through two key\ncomponents: Perplexity Consistency and Reasoning Pruning. Perplexity\nConsistency combines the strengths of self-consistency and perplexity, boosting\nthe convergence rate of estimation error from linear to exponential while\npreserving model error. Reasoning Pruning prevents degradation by eliminating\nlow-probability reasoning paths. Both theoretical analysis and empirical\nresults across seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that RPC has a strong\npotential for reducing reasoning error. Notably, RPC achieves reasoning\nperformance comparable to self-consistency while not only enhancing confidence\nreliability but also reducing sampling costs by 50%.

This specialization allows ParallaxRAG to construct\ncleaner subgraphs and guide LLMs through grounded, step-wise reasoning.\nExperiments on WebQSP and CWQ, under our unified, reproducible setup (BGE-M3 +\nLlama3.1-8B), demonstrate competitive retrieval and QA performance, alongside\nreduced hallucination and good generalization.

These methods have been shown to generally lead to\ninconsistent or suboptimal results, as they do not directly maximize\nsegmentation metrics. To address this issue, a novel consistent segmentation\nframework, RankSEG, has been proposed, which includes RankDice and RankIoU\nspecifically designed to optimize the Dice and IoU metrics, respectively.\nAlthough RankSEG almost guarantees improved performance, it suffers from two\nmajor drawbacks. First, it is its computational expense-RankDice has a\ncomplexity of O(d log d) with a substantial constant factor (where d represents\nthe number of pixels), while RankIoU exhibits even higher complexity O(d^2),\nthus limiting its practical application. For instance, in LiTS, prediction with\nRankSEG takes 16.33 seconds compared to just 0.01 seconds with the argmax rule.\nSecond, RankSEG is only applicable to overlapping segmentation settings, where\nmultiple classes can occupy the same pixel, which contrasts with standard\nbenchmarks that typically assume non-overlapping segmentation.

Here, we introduce the\nGenerative Episodic-Semantic Integration System (GENESIS), a computational\nmodel that formalizes memory as the interaction between two limited-capacity\ngenerative systems: a Cortical-VAE, supporting semantic learning and\ngeneralization, and a Hippocampal-VAE, supporting episodic encoding and\nretrieval within a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) architecture. GENESIS\nreproduces hallmark behavioral findings, including generalization in semantic\nmemory, recognition, serial recall effects and gist-based distortions in\nepisodic memory, and constructive episodic simulation, while capturing their\ndynamic interactions. The model elucidates how capacity constraints shape the\nfidelity and memorability of experiences, how semantic processing introduces\nsystematic distortions in episodic recall, and how episodic replay can\nrecombine previous experiences. Together, these results provide a principled\naccount of memory as an active, constructive, and resource-bounded process.\nGENESIS thus advances a unified theoretical framework that bridges semantic and\nepisodic memory, offering new insights into the generative foundations of human\ncognition."}

Existing\nresearch has rationalized divergence in latent representations in source and\ntarget languages as the source of cross-lingual gap.

However,\nexisting CBMs often suffer from input-to-concept mapping bias and limited\ncontrollability, which restricts their practical value, directly damage the\nresponsibility of strategy from concept-based methods. We propose a lightweight\nDisentangled Concept Bottleneck Model (LDCBM) that automatically groups visual\nfeatures into semantically meaningful components without region annotation. By\nintroducing a filter grouping loss and joint concept supervision, our method\nimproves the alignment between visual patterns and concepts, enabling more\ntransparent and robust decision-making. Notably, Experiments on three diverse\ndatasets demonstrate that LDCBM achieves higher concept and class accuracy,\noutperforming previous CBMs in both interpretability and classification\nperformance. By grounding concepts in visual evidence, our method overcomes a\nfundamental limitation of prior models and enhances the reliability of\ninterpretable AI."}

Given the inherent uncertainty and variability in renewable\ngeneration, probabilistic forecasts have become essential for informed\noperational decisions. However, such forecasts frequently suffer from\ncalibration issues, potentially degrading decision-making performance. Building\non recent advances in Conformal Predictions, this paper introduces a tailored\ncalibration framework that constructs context-aware calibration sets using a\nnovel weighting scheme. The proposed framework improves the quality of\nprobabilistic forecasts at the site and fleet levels, as demonstrated by\nnumerical experiments on large-scale datasets covering several systems in the\nUnited States. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves\nhigher forecast reliability and robustness for renewable energy applications\ncompared to existing baselines."}

Those that\ndo exist typically hold only in restrictive settings: either they rely on\nregular or higher-order tensor representations, leading to impractically\nhigh-dimensional hidden spaces, or they target specialized architectures, often\nconfined to the invariant setting. This work develops a more general account.\nFor invariant networks, we establish a universality theorem under separation\nconstraints, showing that the addition of a fully connected readout layer\nsecures approximation within the class of separation-constrained continuous\nfunctions. For equivariant networks, where results are even scarcer, we\ndemonstrate that standard separability notions are inadequate and introduce the\nsharper criterion of $\\textit{entry-wise separability}$. We show that with\nsufficient depth or with the addition of appropriate readout layers,\nequivariant networks attain universality within the entry-wise separable\nregime. Together with prior results showing the failure of universality for\nshallow models, our findings identify depth and readout layers as a decisive\nmechanism for universality, additionally offering a unified perspective that\nsubsumes and extends earlier specialized results."}

A central question in this setting is how to\neffectively combine multiple observations in order to improve parameter\ninference and obtain sharper posterior distributions. Recent advances in\nscore-based diffusion methods address this problem by constructing a\ncompositional score, obtained by aggregating individual posterior scores within\nthe diffusion process. While it is natural to suspect that the accumulation of\nindividual errors may significantly degrade sampling quality as the number of\nobservations grows, this important theoretical issue has so far remained\nunexplored. In this paper, we study the compositional score produced by the\nGAUSS algorithm of Linhart et al.

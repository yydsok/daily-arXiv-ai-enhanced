Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出Ad-Hoc Human-AI Coordination Challenge (AH2AC2)，通过人类代理解决Hanabi游戏中人类评估的高成本和难复现问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI与人类在复杂协作任务（如Hanabi游戏）中的无缝协调问题，克服人类评估的高成本和难复现限制。

Method: 开发人类代理代理，基于大规模人类游戏数据集，作为廉价、可复现的评估伙伴，并开源有限数据集以鼓励数据高效方法。

Result: 提出了AH2AC2框架，提供了两玩家和三玩家Hanabi场景的基线结果，并通过受控评估系统确保公平性。

Conclusion: AH2AC2为人类-AI协调研究提供了低成本、可复现的评估工具，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Achieving seamless coordination between AI agents and humans is crucial for
real-world applications, yet it remains a significant open challenge. Hanabi is
a cooperative card game featuring imperfect information, constrained
communication, theory of mind requirements, and coordinated action -- making it
an ideal testbed for human-AI coordination. However, its use for human-AI
interaction has been limited by the challenges of human evaluation. In this
work, we introduce the Ad-Hoc Human-AI Coordination Challenge (AH2AC2) to
overcome the constraints of costly and difficult-to-reproduce human
evaluations. We develop \textit{human proxy agents} on a large-scale human
dataset that serve as robust, cheap, and reproducible human-like evaluation
partners in AH2AC2. To encourage the development of data-efficient methods, we
open-source a dataset of 3,079 games, deliberately limiting the amount of
available human gameplay data. We present baseline results for both two- and
three- player Hanabi scenarios. To ensure fair evaluation, we host the proxy
agents through a controlled evaluation system rather than releasing them
publicly. The code is available at

TL;DR: 论文讨论了AI安全的重要性，提出了构建可信生态系统的必要性，并通过2025年新加坡AI会议总结了AI安全研究的三大领域：开发、评估和控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI能力的快速提升，确保其安全性、可靠性和可信性成为关键问题。构建可信生态系统有助于推动创新并避免公众对AI的抵触。

Method: 报告基于国际AI安全报告，采用深度防御模型，将AI安全研究分为开发、评估和控制三大领域。

Result: 明确了AI安全研究的优先级，提出了开发可信AI系统、评估风险以及部署后监控和干预的具体挑战。

Conclusion: 构建可信的AI生态系统是确保AI安全的关键，需要全球合作和多领域研究支持。

Abstract: Rapidly improving AI capabilities and autonomy hold significant promise of
transformation, but are also driving vigorous debate on how to ensure that AI
is safe, i.e., trustworthy, reliable, and secure. Building a trusted ecosystem
is therefore essential -- it helps people embrace AI with confidence and gives
maximal space for innovation while avoiding backlash.
  The "2025 Singapore Conference on AI (SCAI): International Scientific
Exchange on AI Safety" aimed to support research in this space by bringing
together AI scientists across geographies to identify and synthesise research
priorities in AI safety. This resulting report builds on the International AI
Safety Report chaired by Yoshua Bengio and backed by 33 governments. By
adopting a defence-in-depth model, this report organises AI safety research
domains into three types: challenges with creating trustworthy AI systems
(Development), challenges with evaluating their risks (Assessment), and
challenges with monitoring and intervening after deployment (Control).

### [3] [MAGPIE: A dataset for Multi-AGent contextual PrIvacy Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20737)
*Gurusha Juneja,Alon Albalak,Wenyue Hua,William Yang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文研究了LLM代理在协作任务中是否理解上下文隐私，并评估其在多轮对话中保护隐私的能力。结果显示当前模型（如GPT-4o和Claude-2.7-Sonnet）在隐私分类和多轮对话中表现不佳，且多代理系统在71%的情况下无法完成任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM代理的广泛应用，隐私保护成为关键问题。现有基准测试仅评估单轮简单任务，无法反映真实场景中隐私保护的复杂性。

Method: 提出了一个名为MAGPIE的基准测试，包含158个高风险场景，评估LLM代理对上下文隐私的理解及协作能力。

Result: 当前模型在隐私分类和多轮对话中表现不佳，且多代理系统在71%的情况下无法完成任务。

Conclusion: 当前模型在上下文隐私保护和协作任务解决方面尚未达到理想水平。

Abstract: The proliferation of LLM-based agents has led to increasing deployment of
inter-agent collaboration for tasks like scheduling, negotiation, resource
allocation etc. In such systems, privacy is critical, as agents often access
proprietary tools and domain-specific databases requiring strict
confidentiality. This paper examines whether LLM-based agents demonstrate an
understanding of contextual privacy. And, if instructed, do these systems
preserve inference time user privacy in non-adversarial multi-turn
conversation. Existing benchmarks to evaluate contextual privacy in LLM-agents
primarily assess single-turn, low-complexity tasks where private information
can be easily excluded. We first present a benchmark - MAGPIE comprising 158
real-life high-stakes scenarios across 15 domains. These scenarios are designed
such that complete exclusion of private data impedes task completion yet
unrestricted information sharing could lead to substantial losses. We then
evaluate the current state-of-the-art LLMs on (a) their understanding of
contextually private data and (b) their ability to collaborate without
violating user privacy. Empirical experiments demonstrate that current models,
including GPT-4o and Claude-2.7-Sonnet, lack robust understanding of contextual
privacy, misclassifying private data as shareable 25.2\% and 43.6\% of the
time. In multi-turn conversations, these models disclose private information in
59.9\% and 50.5\% of cases even under explicit privacy instructions.
Furthermore, multi-agent systems fail to complete tasks in 71\% of scenarios.
These results underscore that current models are not aligned towards both
contextual privacy preservation and collaborative task-solving.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态上下文感知提示推荐系统，用于领域特定的AI应用，通过多阶段推理和自适应模板生成高质量提示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM应用对用户提示质量敏感，而领域特定应用中高质量提示的生成具有挑战性。

Method: 结合上下文查询分析、检索增强知识基础、分层技能组织和自适应技能排名，利用行为遥测和两阶段分层推理动态生成提示。

Result: 在真实数据集上验证了系统的高实用性和相关性。

Conclusion: 该系统能有效生成相关且可操作的提示建议，提升领域特定AI应用的用户体验。

Abstract: LLM-powered applications are highly susceptible to the quality of user
prompts, and crafting high-quality prompts can often be challenging especially
for domain-specific applications. This paper presents a novel dynamic
context-aware prompt recommendation system for domain-specific AI applications.
Our solution combines contextual query analysis, retrieval-augmented knowledge
grounding, hierarchical skill organization, and adaptive skill ranking to
generate relevant and actionable prompt suggestions.
  The system leverages behavioral telemetry and a two-stage hierarchical
reasoning process to dynamically select and rank relevant skills, and
synthesizes prompts using both predefined and adaptive templates enhanced with
few-shot learning. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our
approach achieves high usefulness and relevance, as validated by both automated
and expert evaluations.

*Chenkai Sun,Denghui Zhang,ChengXiang Zhai,Heng Ji*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种框架，用于评估语言模型建议的宏观社会影响，并引入了一个间接危害场景数据集，以测试模型对潜在不良后果的预见能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型在社会决策中的影响力增加，需要确保其建议的长期安全性。

Method: 提出了一个概念验证框架，用于模拟模型建议在宏观社会系统中的传播，并引入了一个包含100个间接危害场景的数据集。

Result: 新数据集上性能提升超过20%，在现有安全基准测试中平均胜率超过70%。

Conclusion: 该方法为开发更安全的语言模型代理提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Given the growing influence of language model-based agents on high-stakes
societal decisions, from public policy to healthcare, ensuring their beneficial
impact requires understanding the far-reaching implications of their
suggestions. We propose a proof-of-concept framework that projects how
model-generated advice could propagate through societal systems on a
macroscopic scale over time, enabling more robust alignment. To assess the
long-term safety awareness of language models, we also introduce a dataset of
100 indirect harm scenarios, testing models' ability to foresee adverse,
non-obvious outcomes from seemingly harmless user prompts. Our approach
achieves not only over 20% improvement on the new dataset but also an average
win rate exceeding 70% against strong baselines on existing safety benchmarks
(AdvBench, SafeRLHF, WildGuardMix), suggesting a promising direction for safer
agents.

### [6] [Unveiling Causal Reasoning in Large Language Models: Reality or Mirage?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21215)
*Haoang Chi,He Li,Wenjing Yang,Feng Liu,Long Lan,Xiaoguang Ren,Tongliang Liu,Bo Han*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）的因果推理能力，指出其仅能进行浅层（level-1）推理，缺乏人类深层（level-2）推理能力。通过新基准CausalProbe-2024验证，并提出G^2-Reasoner方法提升LLMs的因果推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs是否具备类似人类的真实因果推理能力，发现其仅能进行浅层推理，缺乏深层推理能力。

Method: 通过分析LLMs的自回归机制，提出新基准CausalProbe-2024，并设计G^2-Reasoner方法，结合通用知识和目标导向提示。

Result: LLMs在新基准上表现显著下降，验证其仅能进行level-1推理；G^2-Reasoner显著提升了LLMs的因果推理能力。

Conclusion: G^2-Reasoner为LLMs实现深层因果推理提供了新路径，推动其向level-2推理迈进。

Abstract: Causal reasoning capability is critical in advancing large language models
(LLMs) toward strong artificial intelligence. While versatile LLMs appear to
have demonstrated capabilities in understanding contextual causality and
providing responses that obey the laws of causality, it remains unclear whether
they perform genuine causal reasoning akin to humans. However, current evidence
indicates the contrary. Specifically, LLMs are only capable of performing
shallow (level-1) causal reasoning, primarily attributed to the causal
knowledge embedded in their parameters, but they lack the capacity for genuine
human-like (level-2) causal reasoning. To support this hypothesis,
methodologically, we delve into the autoregression mechanism of
transformer-based LLMs, revealing that it is not inherently causal.
Empirically, we introduce a new causal Q&A benchmark called CausalProbe-2024,
whose corpora are fresh and nearly unseen for the studied LLMs. The LLMs
exhibit a significant performance drop on CausalProbe-2024 compared to earlier
benchmarks, indicating the fact that they primarily engage in level-1 causal
reasoning. To bridge the gap towards level-2 causal reasoning, we draw
inspiration from the fact that human reasoning is usually facilitated by
general knowledge and intended goals. We propose G^2-Reasoner, a method that
incorporates general knowledge and goal-oriented prompts into LLMs' causal
reasoning processes. Experiments demonstrate that G^2-Reasoner significantly
enhances LLMs' causal reasoning capability, particularly in fresh and
counterfactual contexts. This work sheds light on a new path for LLMs to
advance towards genuine causal reasoning, going beyond level-1 and making
strides towards level-2.

*Junhao Shi,Zhaoye Fei,Siyin Wang,Qipeng Guo,Jingjing Gong,Xipeng QIu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: WAP框架通过增强LVLMs的环境理解能力，显著提升了复杂场景下的任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LVLMs在复杂环境和多步目标任务中表现不佳，主要依赖环境无关的模仿学习，缺乏对环境的综合理解。

Method: 提出WAP框架，通过四种认知能力（视觉外观建模、空间推理、功能抽象和语法基础）增强LVLMs，并采用课程学习仅使用原始视觉观察进行训练。

Result: 在EB-ALFRED基准测试中，Qwen2.5-VL任务成功率提升60.7，常识推理和长时规划分别提升60.0和70.0，优于GPT-4o和Claude-3.5-Sonnet。

Conclusion: WAP框架通过环境感知显著提升了LVLMs在复杂任务中的表现，优于现有专有系统。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) show promise for embodied planning tasks
but struggle with complex scenarios involving unfamiliar environments and
multi-step goals. Current approaches rely on environment-agnostic imitation
learning that disconnects instructions from environmental contexts, causing
models to struggle with context-sensitive instructions and rely on
supplementary cues rather than visual reasoning during long-horizon
interactions. In this work, we propose World-Aware Planning Narrative
Enhancement (WAP), a framework that infuses LVLMs with comprehensive
environmental understanding through four cognitive capabilities (visual
appearance modeling, spatial reasoning, functional abstraction, and syntactic
grounding) while developing and evaluating models using only raw visual
observations through curriculum learning. Evaluations on the EB-ALFRED
benchmark demonstrate substantial improvements, with Qwen2.5-VL achieving a
60.7 absolute improvement in task success rates, particularly in commonsense
reasoning (+60.0) and long-horizon planning (+70.0). Notably, our enhanced
open-source models outperform proprietary systems like GPT-4o and
Claude-3.5-Sonnet by a large margin.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: IXAII是一个交互式可解释AI系统，结合了LIME、SHAP、Anchors和DiCE四种方法，支持五种用户群体的定制化视图，提升了透明度和用户体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的事后解释方法多为静态且忽视用户视角，限制了其实际效果。

Method: 开发了交互式系统IXAII，整合四种解释方法，并提供用户对解释内容和格式的控制。

Result: 通过专家和普通用户访谈，IXAII被认为能有效提升透明度。

Conclusion: IXAII为AI解释实践和人机交互提供了新视角。

Abstract: Although several post-hoc methods for explainable AI have been developed,
most are static and neglect the user perspective, limiting their effectiveness
for the target audience. In response, we developed the interactive explainable
intelligent system called IXAII that offers explanations from four explainable
AI methods: LIME, SHAP, Anchors, and DiCE. Our prototype provides tailored
views for five user groups and gives users agency over the explanations'
content and their format. We evaluated IXAII through interviews with experts
and lay users. Our results indicate that IXAII, which provides different
explanations with multiple visualization options, is perceived as helpful to
increase transparency. By bridging the gaps between explainable AI methods,
interactivity, and practical implementation, we provide a novel perspective on
AI explanation practices and human-AI interaction.

TL;DR: 论文提出AI驱动的科学发现需解决抽象、推理与现实三大鸿沟，而非依赖模型规模或数据。提出主动推理AI系统架构，结合因果自监督模型、贝叶斯规划器和闭环实验验证，强调人类判断的不可或缺性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI系统在科学发现中存在局限性，如架构僵化、推理脆弱及与实验现实脱节。论文旨在通过解决三大鸿沟推动AI驱动的科学进步。

Method: 提出主动推理AI系统，包括因果自监督模型、贝叶斯规划器、持久知识图谱及闭环实验验证，强调人类判断的持续参与。

Result: 系统通过内部模型与外部验证的互动实现科学发现，同时依赖人类判断处理反馈的不确定性。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种结合AI与人类判断的架构，为AI驱动的科学发现提供了新方向。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence has led to expectations of
transformative scientific discovery, yet current systems remain fundamentally
limited by their operational architectures, brittle reasoning mechanisms, and
their separation from experimental reality. Building on earlier work, we
contend that progress in AI-driven science now depends on closing three
fundamental gaps -- the abstraction gap, the reasoning gap, and the reality gap
-- rather than on model size/data/test time compute. Scientific reasoning
demands internal representations that support simulation of actions and
response, causal structures that distinguish correlation from mechanism, and
continuous calibration. We define active inference AI systems for scientific
discovery as those that (i) maintain long-lived research memories grounded in
causal self-supervised foundation models, (ii) symbolic or neuro-symbolic
planners equipped with Bayesian guardrails, (iii) grow persistent knowledge
graphs where thinking generates novel conceptual nodes, reasoning establishes
causal edges, and real-world interaction prunes false connections while
strengthening verified pathways, and (iv) refine their internal representations
through closed-loop interaction with both high-fidelity simulators and
automated laboratories - an operational loop where mental simulation guides
action and empirical surprise reshapes understanding. In essence, we outline an
architecture where discovery arises from the interplay between internal models
that enable counterfactual reasoning and external validation that grounds
hypotheses in reality. It is also argued that the inherent ambiguity in
feedback from simulations and experiments, and underlying uncertainties makes
human judgment indispensable, not as a temporary scaffold but as a permanent
architectural component.

*Junwen Zhang,Pu Chen,Yin Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TableMoE是一种神经符号混合专家架构，用于处理多模态表格数据，通过动态路由和符号推理提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM在复杂表格结构（如视觉退化、嵌套布局）下表现不佳，需更鲁棒的解决方案。

Method: 提出TableMoE，采用神经符号路由机制和专家动态分配策略，结合大规模预训练数据集TableMoE-Align。

Result: 在WildStruct基准测试中显著优于现有模型，验证了神经符号路由和专家对齐的有效性。

Conclusion: TableMoE通过神经符号推理提升了多模态表格理解的鲁棒性和可解释性。

Abstract: Multimodal understanding of tables in real-world contexts is challenging due
to the complexity of structure, symbolic density, and visual degradation (blur,
skew, watermarking, incomplete structures or fonts, multi-span or
hierarchically nested layouts). Existing multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) struggle with such WildStruct conditions, resulting in limited
performance and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we propose
TableMoE, a neuro-symbolic Mixture-of-Connector-Experts (MoCE) architecture
specifically designed for robust, structured reasoning over multimodal table
data. TableMoE features an innovative Neuro-Symbolic Routing mechanism, which
predicts latent semantic token roles (e.g., header, data cell, axis, formula)
and dynamically routes table elements to specialized experts (Table-to-HTML,
Table-to-JSON, Table-to-Code) using a confidence-aware gating strategy informed
by symbolic reasoning graphs. To facilitate effective alignment-driven
pretraining, we introduce the large-scale TableMoE-Align dataset, consisting of
1.2M table-HTML-JSON-code quadruples across finance, science, biomedicine and
industry, utilized exclusively for model pretraining. For evaluation, we curate
and release four challenging WildStruct benchmarks: WMMFinQA, WMMTatQA,
WMMTabDialog, and WMMFinanceMath, designed specifically to stress-test models
under real-world multimodal degradation and structural complexity. Experimental
results demonstrate that TableMoE significantly surpasses existing
state-of-the-art models. Extensive ablation studies validate each core
component, emphasizing the critical role of Neuro-Symbolic Routing and
structured expert alignment. Through qualitative analyses, we further showcase
TableMoE's interpretability and enhanced robustness, underscoring the
effectiveness of integrating neuro-symbolic reasoning for multimodal table
understanding.

TL;DR: MindCube基准测试揭示现有视觉语言模型（VLMs）在构建空间心理模型方面的不足，提出“先映射后推理”方法，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索VLMs是否能像人类一样从少量视角构建完整场景的空间心理模型，以弥补其在空间推理上的不足。

Method: 使用MindCube基准测试评估VLMs的空间心理模型能力，并提出三种方法（中间视图、自然语言推理链、认知地图），最终采用“先映射后推理”的协同方法。

Result: 通过“先映射后推理”方法，准确率从37.8%提升至60.8%，加入强化学习后进一步提升至70.7%。

Conclusion: 构建和利用结构化空间表示的空间心理模型支架，能显著提升VLMs对不可观测空间的理解能力。

Abstract: Can Vision Language Models (VLMs) imagine the full scene from just a few
views, like humans do? Humans form spatial mental models, internal
representations of unseen space, to reason about layout, perspective, and
motion. Our new MindCube benchmark with 21,154 questions across 3,268 images
exposes this critical gap, where existing VLMs exhibit near-random performance.
Using MindCube, we systematically evaluate how well VLMs build robust spatial
mental models through representing positions (cognitive mapping), orientations
(perspective-taking), and dynamics (mental simulation for "what-if" movements).
We then explore three approaches to help VLMs approximate spatial mental
models, including unseen intermediate views, natural language reasoning chains,
and cognitive maps. The significant improvement comes from a synergistic
approach, "map-then-reason", that jointly trains the model to first generate a
cognitive map and then reason upon it. By training models to reason over these
internal maps, we boosted accuracy from 37.8% to 60.8% (+23.0%). Adding
reinforcement learning pushed performance even further to 70.7% (+32.9%). Our
key insight is that such scaffolding of spatial mental models, actively
constructing and utilizing internal structured spatial representations with
flexible reasoning processes, significantly improves understanding of
unobservable space.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法无法应对代理搜索系统的复杂性和开放性，需要新的基准和方法。

Method: 构建Mind2Web 2基准，提出Agent-as-a-Judge框架，使用任务特定的代理评估答案正确性和来源归属。

Result: OpenAI Deep Research系统达到人类性能的50-70%，且耗时减半。

Conclusion: Mind2Web 2为下一代代理搜索系统的开发和评估提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Agentic search such as Deep Research systems, where large language models
autonomously browse the web, synthesize information, and return comprehensive
citation-backed answers, represents a major shift in how users interact with
web-scale information. While promising greater efficiency and cognitive
offloading, the growing complexity and open-endedness of agentic search have
outpaced existing evaluation benchmarks and methodologies, which largely assume
short search horizons and static answers. In this paper, we introduce Mind2Web
2, a benchmark of 130 realistic, high-quality, and long-horizon tasks that
require real-time web browsing and extensive information synthesis, constructed
with over 1,000 hours of human labor. To address the challenge of evaluating
time-varying and complex answers, we propose a novel Agent-as-a-Judge
framework. Our method constructs task-specific judge agents based on a
tree-structured rubric design to automatically assess both answer correctness
and source attribution. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of nine frontier
agentic search systems and human performance, along with a detailed error
analysis to draw insights for future development. The best-performing system,
OpenAI Deep Research, can already achieve 50-70% of human performance while
spending half the time, showing a great potential. Altogether, Mind2Web 2
provides a rigorous foundation for developing and benchmarking the next
generation of agentic search systems.

safety, detailed scenario handling, and lightweight deployment. To address
these issues, this study proposes PsyLite, a lightweight psychological
counseling large language model agent developed based on the base model
InternLM2.5-7B-chat. Through a two-stage training strategy (hybrid distillation
data fine-tuning and ORPO preference optimization), PsyLite enhances the
model's deep-reasoning ability, psychological counseling ability, and safe
dialogue ability. After deployment using Ollama and Open WebUI, a custom
workflow is created with Pipelines. An innovative conditional RAG is designed
to introduce crosstalk humor elements at appropriate times during psychological
counseling to enhance user experience and decline dangerous requests to
strengthen dialogue safety. Evaluations show that PsyLite outperforms the
baseline models in the Chinese general evaluation (CEval), psychological
counseling professional evaluation (CPsyCounE), and dialogue safety evaluation
(SafeDialBench), particularly in psychological counseling professionalism
(CPsyCounE score improvement of 47.6\%) and dialogue safety (\safe{} score
improvement of 2.4\%). Additionally, the model uses quantization technology
(GGUF q4\_k\_m) to achieve low hardware deployment (5GB memory is sufficient
for operation), providing a feasible solution for psychological counseling
applications in resource-constrained environments.

### [14] [Towards Probabilistic Question Answering Over Tabular Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20747)
*Chen Shen,Sajjadur Rahman,Estevam Hruschka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了LUCARIO基准和框架，用于处理表格数据的概率性问答，结合贝叶斯网络和LLM，性能优于基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有QA系统在概率性问题（需不确定性推理）上表现不佳，需改进。

Method: 从表格生成贝叶斯网络，将自然语言查询转为概率查询，用LLM生成答案。

Result: 实验显示性能显著优于基线，验证了符号-神经混合推理的优势。

Conclusion: 混合符号-神经推理框架能有效提升概率性问答性能。

Abstract: Current approaches for question answering (QA) over tabular data, such as
NL2SQL systems, perform well for factual questions where answers are directly
retrieved from tables. However, they fall short on probabilistic questions
requiring reasoning under uncertainty. In this paper, we introduce a new
benchmark LUCARIO and a framework for probabilistic QA over large tabular data.
Our method induces Bayesian Networks from tables, translates natural language
queries into probabilistic queries, and uses large language models (LLMs) to
generate final answers. Empirical results demonstrate significant improvements
over baselines, highlighting the benefits of hybrid symbolic-neural reasoning.

### [15] [Multi-lingual Functional Evaluation for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20793)
*Victor Ojewale,Inioluwa Deborah Raji,Suresh Venkatasubramanian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出多语言功能基准测试CL-GSM Symbolic和CL-IFEval，通过翻译现有英文基准模板到五种语言，评估大语言模型的实际性能和鲁棒性。结果显示静态基准与功能基准性能差异显著，且模型在不同语言间的鲁棒性差异较大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有静态多语言基准测试（如Belebele、M-MMLU和M-GSM）未能充分评估模型在多语言环境中的实际性能和鲁棒性，因此需要更贴近实际的功能性基准。

Method: 通过将英文功能基准模板翻译为法、西、印、阿和约鲁巴语，创建CL-GSM Symbolic和CL-IFEval，并对比静态基准与功能基准的性能差异。

Result: 静态基准与功能基准性能差异显著（如M-GSM与CL-GSM Symbolic在英、法、西语中性能下降24%、17%、18%），且模型在阿拉伯语和英语中表现最稳定。

Conclusion: 功能性基准能更准确评估多语言模型的性能和鲁棒性，静态基准的局限性凸显了开发更贴近实际场景的评估工具的必要性。

Abstract: Multi-lingual competence in large language models is often evaluated via
static data benchmarks such as Belebele, M-MMLU and M-GSM. However, these
evaluations often fail to provide an adequate understanding of the practical
performance and robustness of models across multi-lingual settings. In
response, we create multi-lingual functional benchmarks -- Cross-Lingual Grade
School Math Symbolic (CL-GSM Symbolic) and Cross-Lingual Instruction-Following
Eval (CL-IFEval)-- by translating existing functional benchmark templates from
English to five additional languages that span the range of resources available
for NLP: French, Spanish, Hindi, Arabic and Yoruba. Our results reveal that
some static multi-lingual benchmarks capture functional performance much more
closely than others (i.e. across models, there is a 24%, 17% and 18% decrease
in performance between M-GSM and CL-GSM Symbolic in English, French and Spanish
respectively; similarly there's a 15 - 24% performance drop across languages
between Belebele and CL-IFEval, and only a 0.5% to 3% performance drop between
M-MMLU and CL-IFEval). Similarly, we find that model robustness across
languages varies significantly, with certain languages (eg. Arabic, English)
being the most consistently well performing across evaluation iterations.

### [16] [The Ideation-Execution Gap: Execution Outcomes of LLM-Generated versus Human Research Ideas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20803)
*Chenglei Si,Tatsunori Hashimoto,Diyi Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，尽管LLM生成的研究想法在初期被认为更具新颖性，但实际执行后其评分显著下降，表明LLM在生成真正有效的研究想法上仍有局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI生成的研究想法是否能在执行后产生更好的研究成果，以验证LLM在科研中的实际价值。

Method: 招募43名专家研究人员，随机分配执行LLM生成或专家撰写的想法，并通过盲审比较执行前后的评分差异。

Result: 执行后，LLM生成想法的评分显著下降，且多项指标中人类想法反超LLM想法，揭示了LLM的局限性。

Conclusion: 当前LLM在生成有效研究想法上存在不足，且仅凭想法阶段评估难以预测实际执行效果。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in accelerating the
scientific research pipeline. A key capability for this process is the ability
to generate novel research ideas, and prior studies have found settings in
which LLM-generated research ideas were judged as more novel than human-expert
ideas. However, a good idea should not simply appear to be novel, it should
also result in better research after being executed. To test whether
AI-generated ideas lead to better research outcomes, we conduct an execution
study by recruiting 43 expert researchers to execute randomly-assigned ideas,
either written by experts or generated by an LLM. Each expert spent over 100
hours implementing the idea and wrote a 4-page short paper to document the
experiments. All the executed projects are then reviewed blindly by expert NLP
researchers. Comparing the review scores of the same ideas before and after
execution, the scores of the LLM-generated ideas decrease significantly more
than expert-written ideas on all evaluation metrics (novelty, excitement,
effectiveness, and overall; p < 0.05), closing the gap between LLM and human
ideas observed at the ideation stage. When comparing the aggregated review
scores from the execution study, we even observe that for many metrics there is
a flip in rankings where human ideas score higher than LLM ideas. This
ideation-execution gap highlights the limitations of current LLMs in generating
truly effective research ideas and the challenge of evaluating research ideas
in the absence of execution outcomes.

### [17] [MultiFinRAG: An Optimized Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Framework for Financial Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20821)
*Chinmay Gondhalekar,Urjitkumar Patel,Fang-Chun Yeh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MultiFinRAG是一个专为金融问答设计的检索增强生成框架，通过多模态提取和动态上下文切换，显著提升了复杂金融问题的回答准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统大型语言模型和检索增强生成管道在处理多模态金融文档时存在局限性，如令牌限制、布局丢失和跨模态上下文碎片化。

Method: MultiFinRAG通过轻量级多模态LLM提取表格和图像的结构化JSON和文本摘要，结合模态感知相似性阈值进行检索，并采用分层回退策略动态调整上下文。

Result: 在涉及文本、表格、图像和跨模态推理的复杂金融问答任务中，MultiFinRAG比ChatGPT-4o（免费版）准确率高出19个百分点。

Conclusion: MultiFinRAG在商品硬件上实现了高效的多模态金融问答，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Financial documents--such as 10-Ks, 10-Qs, and investor presentations--span
hundreds of pages and combine diverse modalities, including dense narrative
text, structured tables, and complex figures. Answering questions over such
content often requires joint reasoning across modalities, which strains
traditional large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) pipelines due to token limitations, layout loss, and fragmented
cross-modal context. We introduce MultiFinRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation
framework purpose-built for financial QA. MultiFinRAG first performs multimodal
extraction by grouping table and figure images into batches and sending them to
a lightweight, quantized open-source multimodal LLM, which produces both
structured JSON outputs and concise textual summaries. These outputs, along
with narrative text, are embedded and indexed with modality-aware similarity
thresholds for precise retrieval. A tiered fallback strategy then dynamically
escalates from text-only to text+table+image contexts when necessary, enabling
cross-modal reasoning while reducing irrelevant context. Despite running on
commodity hardware, MultiFinRAG achieves 19 percentage points higher accuracy
than ChatGPT-4o (free-tier) on complex financial QA tasks involving text,
tables, images, and combined multimodal reasoning.

TL;DR: 研究评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在道德模糊场景中的暴力倾向，发现其文本生成与内部偏好不一致，且暴力倾向因人口统计特征而异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs被提议用于检测和应对网络暴力内容，但其在现实道德模糊场景中的推理能力尚未充分研究。

Method: 使用社会科学工具VBVQ评估LLMs，引入基于身份的提示方法，评估六种LLMs在零样本设置下的表现。

Result: LLMs的文本生成与暴力偏好不一致，且暴力倾向因人口统计特征而异，与社会科学结论相矛盾。

Conclusion: LLMs在暴力内容处理中存在潜在偏见，需进一步研究其道德推理能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly proposed for detecting and
responding to violent content online, yet their ability to reason about morally
ambiguous, real-world scenarios remains underexamined. We present the first
study to evaluate LLMs using a validated social science instrument designed to
measure human response to everyday conflict, namely the Violent Behavior
Vignette Questionnaire (VBVQ). To assess potential bias, we introduce
persona-based prompting that varies race, age, and geographic identity within
the United States. Six LLMs developed across different geopolitical and
organizational contexts are evaluated under a unified zero-shot setting. Our
study reveals two key findings: (1) LLMs surface-level text generation often
diverges from their internal preference for violent responses; (2) their
violent tendencies vary across demographics, frequently contradicting
established findings in criminology, social science, and psychology.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了医疗领域自动事实核查系统的挑战，指出其未广泛应用的原因，并建议将其视为交互式沟通问题而非端到端过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗决策的高风险性和医学文献的复杂性使得自动事实核查系统需求增加，但现有系统未得到广泛应用。

Method: 通过研究临床专家如何验证社交媒体上的真实医学声明，揭示医疗事实核查的根本挑战。

Result: 发现将野生声明与临床试验证据连接困难、声明模糊性及主观真实性标签等问题。

Conclusion: 建议将事实核查视为交互式沟通问题，而非端到端过程。

Abstract: Technological progress has led to concrete advancements in tasks that were
regarded as challenging, such as automatic fact-checking. Interest in adopting
these systems for public health and medicine has grown due to the high-stakes
nature of medical decisions and challenges in critically appraising a vast and
diverse medical literature. Evidence-based medicine connects to every
individual, and yet the nature of it is highly technical, rendering the medical
literacy of majority users inadequate to sufficiently navigate the domain. Such
problems with medical communication ripens the ground for end-to-end
fact-checking agents: check a claim against current medical literature and
return with an evidence-backed verdict. And yet, such systems remain largely
unused. To understand this, we present the first study examining how clinical
experts verify real claims from social media by synthesizing medical evidence.
In searching for this upper-bound, we reveal fundamental challenges in
end-to-end fact-checking when applied to medicine: Difficulties connecting
claims in the wild to scientific evidence in the form of clinical trials;
ambiguities in underspecified claims mixed with mismatched intentions; and
inherently subjective veracity labels. We argue that fact-checking should be
approached and evaluated as an interactive communication problem, rather than
an end-to-end process.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的对话轮换预测模型缺乏直观和显式的控制方式，无法动态适应不同对话伙伴和场景。

Method: 在基于Transformer的语音活动预测模型基础上，引入文本提示嵌入，通过大语言模型生成合成提示数据。

Result: 实验证明，该模型提高了预测准确性，并能根据文本提示动态调整轮换时机。

Conclusion: 该模型为对话系统提供了更灵活和可控的轮换预测方法。

Abstract: Turn-taking prediction models are essential components in spoken dialogue
systems and conversational robots. Recent approaches leverage transformer-based
architectures to predict speech activity continuously and in real-time. In this
study, we propose a novel model that enables turn-taking prediction to be
dynamically controlled via textual prompts. This approach allows intuitive and
explicit control through instructions such as "faster" or "calmer" adapting
dynamically to conversational partners and contexts. The proposed model builds
upon a transformer-based voice activity projection (VAP) model, incorporating
textual prompt embeddings into both channel-wise transformers and a
cross-channel transformer. We evaluated the feasibility of our approach using
over 950 hours of human-human spoken dialogue data. Since textual prompt data
for the proposed approach was not available in existing datasets, we utilized a
large language model (LLM) to generate synthetic prompt sentences. Experimental
results demonstrated that the proposed model improved prediction accuracy and
effectively varied turn-taking timing behaviors according to the textual
prompts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语言模型在适应特定任务时存在效率低、容易过拟合和计算成本高的问题，限制了其在现实语言任务中的应用。

Conclusion: 论文的进展为更鲁棒和高效的语言模型奠定了基础，推动了人工通用智能的发展。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in NLP, yet
adapting them efficiently and robustly to specific tasks remains challenging.
As their scale and complexity grow, fine-tuning LMs on labelled data often
underutilizes available unlabelled data, leads to overfitting on small
task-specific sets, and imposes significant computational costs. These
limitations hamper their application to the open-ended landscape of real-world
language tasks.
  This thesis proposes a series of methods to better adapt LMs to downstream
applications. First, we explore strategies for extracting task-relevant
knowledge from unlabelled data, introducing a novel continued pre-training
technique that outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised approaches. Next,
we present a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that substantially reduces
memory and compute costs while maintaining competitive performance. We also
introduce improved supervised fine-tuning methods that enable LMs to better
follow instructions, especially when labelled data is scarce, enhancing their
performance across a range of NLP tasks, including open-ended generation.
Finally, we develop new evaluation methods and benchmarks, such as multi-hop
spatial reasoning tasks, to assess LM capabilities and adaptation more
comprehensively.
  Through extensive empirical studies across diverse NLP tasks, our results
demonstrate that these approaches substantially improve LM robustness,
efficiency, and generalization, making them more adaptable to a broad range of
applications. These advances mark a significant step towards more robust and
efficient LMs, bringing us closer to the goal of artificial general
intelligence.

Result: 新管道生成的非英语语料库性能优于现有数据集，并引入数据平衡方法提升性能。

Conclusion: FineWeb2是一个高效的多语言数据集构建工具，支持大规模语言模型训练。

Abstract: Pre-training state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) requires vast
amounts of clean and diverse text data. While the open development of large
high-quality English pre-training datasets has seen substantial recent
progress, training performant multilingual LLMs remains a challenge, in large
part due to the inherent difficulty of tailoring filtering and deduplication
pipelines to a large number of languages. In this work, we introduce a new
pre-training dataset curation pipeline based on FineWeb that can be
automatically adapted to support any language. We extensively ablate our
pipeline design choices on a set of nine diverse languages, guided by a set of
meaningful and informative evaluation tasks that were chosen through a novel
selection process based on measurable criteria. Ultimately, we show that our
pipeline can be used to create non-English corpora that produce more performant
models than prior datasets. We additionally introduce a straightforward and
principled approach to rebalance datasets that takes into consideration both
duplication count and quality, providing an additional performance uplift.
Finally, we scale our pipeline to over 1000 languages using almost 100 Common
Crawl snapshots to produce FineWeb2, a new 20 terabyte (5 billion document)
multilingual dataset which we release along with our pipeline, training, and
evaluation codebases.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose KaLM-Embedding-V2, a versatile and compact
embedding model, which achieves impressive performance in general-purpose text
embedding tasks by leveraging superior training techniques and data. Our key
innovations include: (1) To better align the architecture with representation
learning, we remove the causal attention mask and adopt a fully bidirectional
transformer with simple yet effective mean-pooling to produce fixed-length
embeddings; (2) We employ a multi-stage training pipeline: (i) pre-training on
large-scale weakly supervised open-source corpora; (ii) fine-tuning on
high-quality retrieval and non-retrieval datasets; and (iii) model-soup
parameter averaging for robust generalization. Besides, we introduce a
focal-style reweighting mechanism that concentrates learning on difficult
samples and an online hard-negative mixing strategy to continuously enrich hard
negatives without expensive offline mining; (3) We collect over 20 categories
of data for pre-training and 100 categories of data for fine-tuning, to boost
both the performance and generalization of the embedding model. Extensive
evaluations on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) Chinese and English
show that our model significantly outperforms others of comparable size, and
competes with 3x, 14x, 18x, and 26x larger embedding models, setting a new
standard for a versatile and compact embedding model with less than 1B
parameters.

Method: 构建了一个大规模数据集（15万对偏好标注），利用离线对齐方法微调全双工自回归语音模型。

Result: 实验表明，通用对话的反馈能有效改进模型，生成更准确、安全且上下文一致的交互。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在实时语音对话系统中平衡多种动态因素的重要性。

Abstract: We propose a novel preference alignment framework for improving spoken
dialogue models on real-time conversations from user interactions. Current
preference learning methods primarily focus on text-based language models, and
are not directly suited to the complexities of real-time speech interactions,
with richer dynamics (e.g. interruption, interjection) and no explicit
segmentation between speaker turns.We create a large-scale dataset of more than
150,000 preference pairs from raw multi-turn speech conversations, annotated
with AI feedback, to cover preferences over both linguistic content and
temporal context variations. We leverage offline alignment methods to finetune
a full-duplex autoregressive speech-to-speech model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that feedback on generic conversations can be consistently
effective in improving spoken dialogue models to produce more factual, safer
and more contextually aligned interactions. We deploy the finetuned model and
conduct holistic human evaluations to assess the impact beyond single-turn
conversations. Our findings shed light on the importance of a well-calibrated
balance among various dynamics, crucial for natural real-time speech dialogue
systems.

Conclusion: 研究表明，适当的初始化下梯度下降具有强大的表达能力，为长上下文建模和梯度学习泛化能力提供了新思路。

Abstract: There are two primary ways of incorporating new information into a language
model (LM): changing its prompt or changing its parameters, e.g. via
fine-tuning. Parameter updates incur no long-term storage cost for model
changes. However, for many model updates, prompting is significantly more
effective: prompted models can generalize robustly from single examples and
draw logical inferences that do not occur under standard fine-tuning. Can
models be modified so that fine-tuning does emulate prompting? This paper
describes a method for meta-training LMs such that gradient updates emulate the
effects of conditioning on new information. Our approach uses tools from
gradient-based meta-learning but uses an LM's own prompted predictions as
targets, eliminating the need for ground-truth labels. Subsequent gradient
descent training recovers some (and occasionally all) of prompted model
performance -- showing improvement on the ``reversal curse'' tasks, and
answering questions about text passages after a single gradient update. These
results suggest that, with appropriate initialization, gradient descent can be
surprisingly expressive. Our results suggest new avenues for long-context
modeling and offer insight into the generalization capabilities of
gradient-based learning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have gained significant traction across a wide
range of fields in recent years. There is also a growing expectation for them
to display human-like personalities during interactions. To meet this
expectation, numerous studies have proposed methods for modelling LLM
personalities through psychometric evaluations. However, most existing models
face two major limitations: they rely on the Big Five (OCEAN) framework, which
only provides coarse personality dimensions, and they lack mechanisms for
controlling trait intensity. In this paper, we address this gap by extending
the Machine Personality Inventory (MPI), which originally used the Big Five
model, to incorporate the 16 Personality Factor (16PF) model, allowing
expressive control over sixteen distinct traits. We also developed a structured
framework known as Specific Attribute Control (SAC) for evaluating and
dynamically inducing trait intensity in LLMs. Our method introduces
adjective-based semantic anchoring to guide trait intensity expression and
leverages behavioural questions across five intensity factors:
\textit{Frequency}, \textit{Depth}, \textit{Threshold}, \textit{Effort}, and
\textit{Willingness}. Through experimentation, we find that modelling intensity
as a continuous spectrum yields substantially more consistent and controllable
personality expression compared to binary trait toggling. Moreover, we observe
that changes in target trait intensity systematically influence closely related
traits in psychologically coherent directions, suggesting that LLMs internalize
multi-dimensional personality structures rather than treating traits in
isolation. Our work opens new pathways for controlled and nuanced human-machine
interactions in domains such as healthcare, education, and interviewing
processes, bringing us one step closer to truly human-like social machines.

Abstract: Advanced intelligent systems, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), are
significantly reshaping financial practices through advancements in Natural
Language Processing (NLP). However, the extent to which these models
effectively capture and apply domain-specific financial knowledge remains
uncertain. Addressing a critical gap in the expansive Indian financial context,
this paper introduces CA-Ben, a Chartered Accountancy benchmark specifically
designed to evaluate the financial, legal, and quantitative reasoning
capabilities of LLMs. CA-Ben comprises structured question-answer datasets
derived from the rigorous examinations conducted by the Institute of Chartered
Accountants of India (ICAI), spanning foundational, intermediate, and advanced
CA curriculum stages. Six prominent LLMs i.e. GPT 4o, LLAMA 3.3 70B, LLAMA 3.1
405B, MISTRAL Large, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Microsoft Phi 4 were evaluated
using standardized protocols. Results indicate variations in performance, with
Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4o outperforming others, especially in conceptual and
legal reasoning. Notable challenges emerged in numerical computations and legal
interpretations. The findings emphasize the strengths and limitations of
current LLMs, suggesting future improvements through hybrid reasoning and
retrieval-augmented generation methods, particularly for quantitative analysis

### [28] [A Semi-supervised Scalable Unified Framework for E-commerce Query Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21049)
*Chunyuan Yuan,Chong Zhang,Zheng Fang,Ming Pang,Xue Jiang,Changping Peng,Zhangang Lin,Ching Law*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种半监督可扩展统一框架（SSUF），用于解决电商查询分类中的信息不足和标签依赖问题，显著优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电商查询通常简短且缺乏上下文，现有方法依赖用户点击行为，导致马太效应，且缺乏统一框架。

Method: SSUF框架包含知识增强、标签增强和结构增强模块，分别解决信息不足、标签依赖和标签关系问题。

Result: 离线与在线A/B实验表明，SSUF显著优于现有模型。

Conclusion: SSUF为查询分类任务提供了高效、统一的解决方案。

Abstract: Query classification, including multiple subtasks such as intent and category
prediction, is vital to e-commerce applications. E-commerce queries are usually
short and lack context, and the information between labels cannot be used,
resulting in insufficient prior information for modeling. Most existing
industrial query classification methods rely on users' posterior click behavior
to construct training samples, resulting in a Matthew vicious cycle.
Furthermore, the subtasks of query classification lack a unified framework,
leading to low efficiency for algorithm optimization.
  In this paper, we propose a novel Semi-supervised Scalable Unified Framework
(SSUF), containing multiple enhanced modules to unify the query classification
tasks. The knowledge-enhanced module uses world knowledge to enhance query
representations and solve the problem of insufficient query information. The
label-enhanced module uses label semantics and semi-supervised signals to
reduce the dependence on posterior labels. The structure-enhanced module
enhances the label representation based on the complex label relations. Each
module is highly pluggable, and input features can be added or removed as
needed according to each subtask. We conduct extensive offline and online A/B
experiments, and the results show that SSUF significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出MT2-CSD数据集和LLM-CRAN模型，用于多目标多轮对话中的立场检测，显著优于基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统立场检测研究局限于单实例分析，缺乏真实社交媒体的多轮对话数据集，限制了对话立场检测的发展。

Method: 引入MT2-CSD数据集，提出LLM-CRAN模型，利用大语言模型的推理能力提升对话理解。

Result: LLM-CRAN在MT2-CSD数据集上显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: MT2-CSD和LLM-CRAN为对话立场检测提供了新工具和挑战。

Abstract: In the realm of contemporary social media, automatic stance detection is
pivotal for opinion mining, as it synthesizes and examines user perspectives on
contentious topics to uncover prevailing trends and sentiments. Traditional
stance detection research often targets individual instances, thereby limiting
its capacity to model multi-party discussions typical in real social media
scenarios. This shortcoming largely stems from the scarcity of datasets that
authentically capture the dynamics of social media interactions, hindering
advancements in conversational stance detection. In this paper, we introduce
MT2-CSD, a comprehensive dataset for multi-target, multi-turn conversational
stance detection. To the best of our knowledge, MT2-CSD is the largest dataset
available for this purpose, comprising 24,457 annotated instances and
exhibiting the greatest conversational depth, thereby presenting new challenges
for stance detection. To address these challenges, we propose the Large
Language model enhanced Conversational Relational Attention Network (LLM-CRAN),
which exploits the reasoning capabilities of LLMs to improve conversational
understanding. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the efficacy of
LLM-CRAN on the MT2-CSD dataset. The experimental results indicate that
LLM-CRAN significantly outperforms strong baseline models in the task of
conversational stance detection.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于分块的自动流畅度评估方法，结合多种自监督学习模型和分层CNN-BiLSTM框架，显著提升了评估性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非母语者的语音流畅度评估（AFA）在捕捉语音节奏、停顿和不流畅性方面仍具挑战性。

Method: 采用分块方法，结合Wav2Vec2、HuBERT和WavLM等自监督学习模型，利用Silero-VAD进行语音分段，并通过加权机制融合特征，结合CNN-BiLSTM框架分析局部和长期依赖关系。

Result: 在Speechocean762和Avalinguo数据集上，F1分数和Pearson相关系数分别提升了2.8/6.2和4.2/4.0，优于单模型和Pyannote.audio基线。

Conclusion: 分块多模型融合方法对流畅度评估具有鲁棒性，但需进一步研究其在非规则韵律方言中的泛化能力。

Abstract: Automatic fluency assessment (AFA) remains challenging, particularly in
capturing speech rhythm, pauses, and disfluencies in non-native speakers. We
introduce a chunk-based approach integrating self-supervised learning (SSL)
models (Wav2Vec2, HuBERT, and WavLM) selected for their complementary strengths
in phonetic, prosodic, and noisy speech modeling, with a hierarchical
CNN-BiLSTM framework. Speech is segmented into breath-group chunks using Silero
voice activity detection (Silero-VAD), enabling fine-grained temporal analysis
while mitigating over-segmentation artifacts. SSL embeddings are fused via a
learnable weighted mechanism, balancing acoustic and linguistic features, and
enriched with chunk-level fluency markers (e.g., speech rate, pause durations,
n-gram repetitions). The CNN-BiLSTM captures local and long-term dependencies
across chunks. Evaluated on Avalinguo and Speechocean762, our approach improves
F1-score by 2.8 and Pearson correlation by 6.2 points over single SSL baselines
on Speechocean762, with gains of 4.2 F1-score and 4.0 Pearson points on
Avalinguo, surpassing Pyannote.audio-based segmentation baselines. These
findings highlight chunk-based multi-SSL fusion for robust fluency evaluation,
though future work should explore generalization to dialects with irregular
prosody.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DALR提出了一种双层次对齐学习方法，通过一致性学习和排名蒸馏解决跨模态和模态内对齐问题，显著提升了多模态句子表示的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在粗粒度上对齐图像和文本，存在跨模态偏差和模态内语义差异问题，影响了句子表示的质量。

Method: DALR通过一致性学习模块实现细粒度跨模态对齐，并结合排名蒸馏与全局模态内对齐学习捕捉复杂句子关系。

Result: 在语义文本相似性（STS）和迁移（TR）任务上的实验表明，DALR优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: DALR通过双层次对齐学习有效解决了多模态句子表示中的对齐问题，提升了表示质量。

Abstract: Previous multimodal sentence representation learning methods have achieved
impressive performance. However, most approaches focus on aligning images and
text at a coarse level, facing two critical challenges:cross-modal misalignment
bias and intra-modal semantic divergence, which significantly degrade sentence
representation quality. To address these challenges, we propose DALR
(Dual-level Alignment Learning for Multimodal Sentence Representation). For
cross-modal alignment, we propose a consistency learning module that softens
negative samples and utilizes semantic similarity from an auxiliary task to
achieve fine-grained cross-modal alignment. Additionally, we contend that
sentence relationships go beyond binary positive-negative labels, exhibiting a
more intricate ranking structure. To better capture these relationships and
enhance representation quality, we integrate ranking distillation with global
intra-modal alignment learning. Comprehensive experiments on semantic textual
similarity (STS) and transfer (TR) tasks validate the effectiveness of our
approach, consistently demonstrating its superiority over state-of-the-art
baselines.

Motivation: 社区问答平台作为重要知识库，但现有方法未能充分利用外部知识或动态历史上下文，且缺乏适合工业部署的内存机制。

Method: 提出ComRAG框架，整合静态知识与动态历史问答对，采用基于质心的内存机制，支持检索、生成和高效存储。

Result: 在三个工业CQA数据集上，ComRAG显著优于基线，向量相似度提升25.9%，延迟降低8.7%-23.3%，块增长从20.23%降至2.06%。

Conclusion: ComRAG通过结合静态与动态知识，显著提升工业CQA性能，适合实时部署。

Abstract: Community Question Answering (CQA) platforms can be deemed as important
knowledge bases in community, but effectively leveraging historical
interactions and domain knowledge in real-time remains a challenge. Existing
methods often underutilize external knowledge, fail to incorporate dynamic
historical QA context, or lack memory mechanisms suited for industrial
deployment. We propose ComRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation framework for
real-time industrial CQA that integrates static knowledge with dynamic
historical QA pairs via a centroid-based memory mechanism designed for
retrieval, generation, and efficient storage. Evaluated on three industrial CQA
datasets, ComRAG consistently outperforms all baselines--achieving up to 25.9%
improvement in vector similarity, reducing latency by 8.7% to 23.3%, and
lowering chunk growth from 20.23% to 2.06% over iterations.

TL;DR: Progtuning是一种结合渐进学习的微调框架，通过逐步减少更新的Transformer块数量，优化资源分配并减少约25%的更新参数，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着模型规模增大，全参数微调成本高昂，现有参数高效微调方法仍需更新相同数量的参数，导致资源分配低效。

Method: 提出Progtuning框架，基于贡献逐步减少更新的Transformer块数量。

Result: 减少约25%的更新参数，同时保持竞争力性能，并展示与参数高效微调方法的高适应性。

Conclusion: Progtuning显著优化资源分配，适用于多种适应场景。

Abstract: Fine-tuning is a promising technique for leveraging Transformer-based
language models in downstream tasks. As model sizes continue to grow, updating
all model parameters becomes increasingly costly. Parameter-efficient
fine-tuning methods effectively address this issue by selectively updating a
small subset of parameters. However, fine-tuning and most existing
parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods require updating the same number of
parameters as the initial size, ignoring the unequal contribution across
Transformer blocks and leading to extremely inefficient allocation of computing
resources. In this paper, we propose Progtuning, the novel fine-tuning
framework combined with progressive learning for Transformer-based language
models. Specifically, Progtuning progressively reduces the number of updated
transformer blocks based on the contribution. Remarkably, Progtuning optimizes
resource allocation and reduces the number of updated parameters by
approximately 25\%, while still maintaining competitive performance. And it
also exhibits high adaptability with parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods,
demonstrating excellent performance across various adaptation scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Cosmos是一种基于压缩潜在空间的文本生成方法，通过扩散模型实现并行生成，解决了自回归模型的慢速解码问题，并在生成质量和速度上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归语言模型在文本生成中存在解码速度慢和全局一致性难以保持的问题，扩散模型虽然提供了并行生成的可能性，但受限于高维度的令牌级表示。

Method: Cosmos通过训练一个同时支持令牌级重建和与预训练语言编码器对齐的自编码器，学习压缩的平滑潜在空间，用于扩散生成。

Result: 实验表明，Cosmos能将文本表示压缩8倍，生成质量与令牌级扩散模型相当，且通过增加潜在序列长度，超越扩散和自回归基线。

Conclusion: Cosmos在多种生成任务中表现优异，生成质量相当或更优，推理速度快2倍以上。

Abstract: Autoregressive language models dominate modern text generation, yet their
sequential nature introduces fundamental limitations: decoding is slow, and
maintaining global coherence remains challenging. Diffusion models offer a
promising alternative by enabling parallel generation and flexible control;
however, their application to text generation is hindered by the high
dimensionality of token-level representations. We introduce Cosmos, a novel
approach to text generation that operates entirely in a compressed, smooth
latent space tailored specifically for diffusion. This space is learned using
an autoencoder trained simultaneously for token-level reconstruction and
alignment with frozen activations from a pretrained language encoder, providing
robust semantic grounding and enabling effective perturbation-based
augmentations. Empirically, we demonstrate that text representations can be
compressed by $8\times$ while maintaining generation quality comparable to
token-level diffusion models. Furthermore, increasing the latent sequence
length allows Cosmos to surpass both diffusion-based and autoregressive
baselines. We evaluate Cosmos on four diverse generative tasks including story
generation, question generation, summarization, and detoxification and compare
it with various generative paradigms. Cosmos achieves comparable or superior
generation quality while offering more than $2\times$ faster inference.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于检索的提示策略，利用句法相似性而非语义相似性选择演示，以提高自动术语提取（ATE）的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型（LLM）在多种NLP任务中表现优异，但其在ATE任务中的潜力尚未充分探索。

Method: 采用基于句法相似性的检索方法，在少样本设置中选择演示，该方法与领域无关且能更可靠地捕捉术语边界。

Result: 在三个专业ATE基准测试中，句法检索方法提高了F1分数，尤其在查询句子与检索示例的词汇重叠情况下表现更佳。

Conclusion: 句法线索在将LLM适应于术语提取任务中具有重要作用。

Abstract: Automatic Term Extraction (ATE) identifies domain-specific expressions that
are crucial for downstream tasks such as machine translation and information
retrieval. Although large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced
various NLP tasks, their potential for ATE has scarcely been examined. We
propose a retrieval-based prompting strategy that, in the few-shot setting,
selects demonstrations according to \emph{syntactic} rather than semantic
similarity. This syntactic retrieval method is domain-agnostic and provides
more reliable guidance for capturing term boundaries. We evaluate the approach
in both in-domain and cross-domain settings, analyzing how lexical overlap
between the query sentence and its retrieved examples affects performance.
Experiments on three specialized ATE benchmarks show that syntactic retrieval
improves F1-score. These findings highlight the importance of syntactic cues
when adapting LLMs to terminology-extraction tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏外部反馈，多模态代理在自我纠正和泛化方面表现不佳，需要专门的奖励模型来提升性能。

Method: 设计了Agent-RewardBench，包含多维度评估、步骤级奖励评估和高质量数据采样，覆盖7种现实场景。

Result: 实验表明，即使是先进的多模态模型在奖励建模方面表现有限，需专门训练。

Conclusion: Agent-RewardBench为评估和改进代理奖励建模能力提供了有效工具，推动了多模态代理的发展。

Abstract: As Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) advance, multimodal agents show
promise in real-world tasks like web navigation and embodied intelligence.
However, due to limitations in a lack of external feedback, these agents
struggle with self-correction and generalization. A promising approach is to
use reward models as external feedback, but there is no clear on how to select
reward models for agents. Thus, there is an urgent need to build a reward bench
targeted at agents. To address these challenges, we propose Agent-RewardBench,
a benchmark designed to evaluate reward modeling ability in MLLMs. The
benchmark is characterized by three key features: (1) Multiple dimensions and
real-world agent scenarios evaluation. It covers perception, planning, and
safety with 7 scenarios; (2) Step-level reward evaluation. It allows for the
assessment of agent capabilities at the individual steps of a task, providing a
more granular view of performance during the planning process; and (3)
Appropriately difficulty and high-quality. We carefully sample from 10 diverse
models, difficulty control to maintain task challenges, and manual verification
to ensure the integrity of the data. Experiments demonstrate that even
state-of-the-art multimodal models show limited performance, highlighting the
need for specialized training in agent reward modeling. Code is available at

Motivation: 研究动机是探讨大语言模型生成虚假文本的能力是否会随着模型规模的增大而无限提升，以及检测方法是否仍能保持有效性。

Method: 通过统计分类器检测古典侦探小说风格的虚假文本，比较不同版本模型的生成能力。

Result: 研究发现，Gemini模型在生成欺骗性文本方面能力增强，而GPT模型未表现出类似趋势，表明检测虚假文本仍可行。

Conclusion: 结论是即使模型规模增大，虚假文本的检测仍可能保持可行性，但新模型架构可能提升欺骗性。

Abstract: Large language models can produce convincing "fake text" in domains such as
academic writing, product reviews, and political news. Many approaches have
been investigated for the detection of artificially generated text. While this
may seem to presage an endless "arms race", we note that newer LLMs use ever
more parameters, training data, and energy, while relatively simple classifiers
demonstrate a good level of detection accuracy with modest resources. To
approach the question of whether the models' ability to beat the detectors may
therefore reach a plateau, we examine the ability of statistical classifiers to
identify "fake text" in the style of classical detective fiction. Over a 0.5
version increase, we found that Gemini showed an increased ability to generate
deceptive text, while GPT did not. This suggests that reliable detection of
fake text may remain feasible even for ever-larger models, though new model
architectures may improve their deceptiveness

Motivation: 慢思考LLMs在生成批判性反馈和优化解决方案方面能力有限，需要改进。

Method: 提出Double-Checker框架，基于1,730个自我批判实例微调，实现迭代自我批判和优化。

Result: 在AIME基准上，pass@1性能从4.4%提升至18.2%。

Conclusion: Double-Checker为开发更可信、高效的LLMs提供了新方向。

Abstract: While slow-thinking large language models (LLMs) exhibit reflection-like
reasoning, commonly referred to as the "aha moment:, their ability to generate
informative critiques and refine prior solutions remains limited. In this
paper, we introduce Double-Checker, a principled framework designed to enhance
the reasoning capabilities of slow-thinking LLMs by fostering explicit
self-critique and iterative refinement of their previous solutions. By
fine-tuning on our curated 1,730 self-critical instances, Double-Checker
empowers long-CoT LLMs to iteratively critique and refine their outputs during
inference until they evaluate their solutions as correct under self-generated
critiques. We validate the efficacy of Double-Checker across a comprehensive
suite of reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating that iterative self-critique
significantly enhances the reasoning capabilities of long-CoT LLMs. Notably,
our Double-Checker increases the pass@1 performance on challenging AIME
benchmarks from 4.4% to 18.2% compared to the original long-CoT LLMs. These
results highlight a promising direction for developing more trustworthy and
effective LLMs capable of structured self-critique.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在上下文信息不足时可能生成不可靠的回答，因此需要一种机制在生成答案前检测查询是否基于上下文，以提高效率和可靠性。

Method: 使用轻量级编码器模型（如RoBERTa和NomicBERT）进行微调，检测查询是否基于提供的文档上下文。

Result: 这些轻量级模型在检测任务中表现接近最先进的LLMs，同时大幅减少推理时间和资源消耗。

Conclusion: 轻量级模型在检测查询的上下文相关性方面高效且可靠，为LLMs的实际应用提供了优化方案。

Abstract: Augmenting large language models (LLMs) with external context significantly
improves their performance in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However,
LLMs struggle to answer queries reliably when the provided context lacks
information, often resorting to ungrounded speculation or internal knowledge.
Groundedness - generating responses strictly supported by the context - is
essential for ensuring factual consistency and trustworthiness. This study
focuses on detecting whether a given query is grounded in a document provided
in context before the costly answer generation by LLMs. Such a detection
mechanism can significantly reduce both inference time and resource
consumption. We show that lightweight, task specific encoder models such as
RoBERTa and NomicBERT, fine-tuned on curated datasets, can achieve accuracy
comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs, such as Llama3 8B and GPT4o, in
groundedness detection while reducing inference latency by orders of magnitude.

Motivation: 研究语言上下文是否能独立支持视觉对话中指代表达式的检测，探索文本方法的有效性。

Method: 采用预训练大型语言模型（LLM），通过下一词预测标注对话中的指代表达式边界。

Result: 即使使用中等规模LLM和小数据集，文本方法仍有效，表明语言上下文的重要性。

Conclusion: 任务本质为多模态，单模态方法存在根本限制。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the use of a text-only, autoregressive language
modeling approach for the extraction of referring expressions from visually
grounded dialogue. More specifically, the aim is to investigate the extent to
which the linguistic context alone can inform the detection of mentions that
have a (visually perceivable) referent in the visual context of the
conversation. To this end, we adapt a pretrained large language model (LLM) to
perform a relatively course-grained annotation of mention spans in unfolding
conversations by demarcating mention span boundaries in text via next-token
prediction. Our findings indicate that even when using a moderately sized LLM,
relatively small datasets, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, a text-only
approach can be effective, highlighting the relative importance of the
linguistic context for this task. Nevertheless, we argue that the task
represents an inherently multimodal problem and discuss limitations fundamental
to unimodal approaches.

Conclusion: GLASS为文学研究与教育提供AI工具，揭示了文学认知机制。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in understanding and generating text but
struggle with providing professional literary criticism for works with profound
thoughts and complex narratives. This paper proposes GLASS (Greimas Literary
Analysis via Semiotic Square), a structured analytical framework based on
Greimas Semiotic Square (GSS), to enhance LLMs' ability to conduct in-depth
literary analysis. GLASS facilitates the rapid dissection of narrative
structures and deep meanings in narrative works. We propose the first dataset
for GSS-based literary criticism, featuring detailed analyses of 48 works. Then
we propose quantitative metrics for GSS-based literary criticism using the
LLM-as-a-judge paradigm. Our framework's results, compared with expert
criticism across multiple works and LLMs, show high performance. Finally, we
applied GLASS to 39 classic works, producing original and high-quality analyses
that address existing research gaps. This research provides an AI-based tool
for literary research and education, offering insights into the cognitive
mechanisms underlying literary engagement.

Motivation: 现实中的RAG系统在处理噪声多、模糊且多意图的用户查询时表现不佳，现有系统通常基于干净数据训练或评估，无法满足实际需求。

Method: Omni-RAG采用三个模块：深度查询理解与分解、意图感知知识检索、重排与生成，利用LLM和特定工具（如OpenSearch、BGE、Falcon-10B）处理查询。

Result: Omni-RAG能够有效处理复杂和噪声查询，提升RAG系统在实时应用中的表现。

Conclusion: Omni-RAG填补了现有RAG能力与实际需求之间的差距，适用于如SIGIR 2025 LiveRAG Challenge等场景。

Abstract: Real-world live retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems face significant
challenges when processing user queries that are often noisy, ambiguous, and
contain multiple intents. While RAG enhances large language models (LLMs) with
external knowledge, current systems typically struggle with such complex

introduces Omni-RAG, a novel framework designed to improve the robustness and
effectiveness of RAG systems in live, open-domain settings. Omni-RAG employs
LLM-assisted query understanding to preprocess user inputs through three key
modules: (1) Deep Query Understanding and Decomposition, which utilizes LLMs
with tailored prompts to denoise queries (e.g., correcting spelling errors) and
decompose multi-intent queries into structured sub-queries; (2) Intent-Aware
Knowledge Retrieval, which performs retrieval for each sub-query from a corpus
(i.e., FineWeb using OpenSearch) and aggregates the results; and (3) Reranking
and Generation, where a reranker (i.e., BGE) refines document selection before
a final response is generated by an LLM (i.e., Falcon-10B) using a
chain-of-thought prompt. Omni-RAG aims to bridge the gap between current RAG
capabilities and the demands of real-world applications, such as those
highlighted by the SIGIR 2025 LiveRAG Challenge, by robustly handling complex
and noisy queries.

### [44] [Domain Knowledge-Enhanced LLMs for Fraud and Concept Drift Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21443)
*Ali Şenol,Garima Agrawal,Huan Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合领域知识（DK）和大型语言模型（LLM）的框架，用于检测欺骗性对话和概念漂移（CD），在虚假评论和多轮对话数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态平台上欺骗性对话的检测因语言模式演变和概念漂移（CD）而变得困难，LLMs在风险敏感场景中表现不佳，需要结合领域知识提升性能。

Method: 提出DK-Enhanced LLM框架，包含三个模块：DK-LLM检测欺骗对话、OCDD检测语义漂移、第二个DK-LLM分类漂移性质。基于LLaMA实现。

Result: 在虚假评论和多轮对话数据集（SEConvo）上，系统检测欺骗对话准确率高，漂移分类准确率达98%，显著优于零样本基线。

Conclusion: 结合领域知识和漂移检测显著提升了高风险NLP应用的性能、可解释性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Detecting deceptive conversations on dynamic platforms is increasingly
difficult due to evolving language patterns and Concept Drift (CD)-i.e.,
semantic or topical shifts that alter the context or intent of interactions
over time. These shifts can obscure malicious intent or mimic normal dialogue,
making accurate classification challenging. While Large Language Models (LLMs)
show strong performance in natural language tasks, they often struggle with
contextual ambiguity and hallucinations in risk-sensitive scenarios. To address
these challenges, we present a Domain Knowledge (DK)-Enhanced LLM framework
that integrates pretrained LLMs with structured, task-specific insights to
perform fraud and concept drift detection. The proposed architecture consists
of three main components: (1) a DK-LLM module to detect fake or deceptive
conversations; (2) a drift detection unit (OCDD) to determine whether a
semantic shift has occurred; and (3) a second DK-LLM module to classify the
drift as either benign or fraudulent. We first validate the value of domain
knowledge using a fake review dataset and then apply our full framework to
SEConvo, a multiturn dialogue dataset that includes various types of fraud and
spam attacks. Results show that our system detects fake conversations with high
accuracy and effectively classifies the nature of drift. Guided by structured
prompts, the LLaMA-based implementation achieves 98% classification accuracy.
Comparative studies against zero-shot baselines demonstrate that incorporating
domain knowledge and drift awareness significantly improves performance,
interpretability, and robustness in high-stakes NLP applications.

*Makbule Gulcin Ozsoy,William Tai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了基础大语言模型在Text2Cypher任务中的多语言性能，发现英语表现最佳，西班牙语次之，土耳其语最差，并探讨了提示翻译的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自然语言接口研究主要集中于英语，缺乏对其他语言的评估，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过翻译英文问题创建多语言测试集，使用标准化提示和指标评估基础模型。

Result: 模型性能排序为英语>西班牙语>土耳其语，提示翻译对结果影响较小。

Conclusion: 研究强调了多语言查询生成中更包容的评估和开发的必要性，未来工作包括模式本地化和多语言微调。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have enabled natural language
interfaces that translate user questions into database queries, such as
Text2SQL, Text2SPARQL, and Text2Cypher. While these interfaces enhance database
accessibility, most research today focuses solely on English, with limited
evaluation in other languages. This paper investigates the performance of
foundational LLMs on the Text2Cypher task across multiple languages. We create
and release a multilingual test set by translating English questions into
Spanish and Turkish while preserving the original Cypher queries, enabling fair
cross-lingual comparison. We evaluate multiple foundational models using
standardized prompts and metrics. Our results show a consistent performance
pattern: highest on English, then Spanish, and lowest on Turkish. We attribute
this to differences in training data availability and linguistic
characteristics. Additionally, we explore the impact of translating task
prompts into Spanish and Turkish. Results show little to no change in
evaluation metrics, suggesting prompt translation has minor impact. Our
findings highlight the need for more inclusive evaluation and development in
multilingual query generation. Future work includes schema localization and
fine-tuning across diverse languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的Transformer架构，通过引入TopK激活函数，解决了稀疏自编码器（SAE）在语言模型（LM）分析中的局限性，提升了模型的解释性和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏自编码器（SAE）在分析Transformer语言模型的激活空间时存在局限性，如后训练的不确定性和特征不稳定性，影响了其有效性和内部效度。

Method: 提出了一种改进的Transformer架构，在特定层引入TopK激活函数，使隐藏状态等同于TopK SAE的潜在特征，无需后训练即可提供解释性。

Result: TopK LMs在模型大小、计算效率和解释性之间取得了良好平衡，保持了原始能力，同时支持神经元干预和跨检查点的详细分析。

Conclusion: TopK LMs为理解语言模型的学习和概念表示提供了稳定可靠的工具，有望推动模型解释性和可控性的研究。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have become an important tool for analyzing and
interpreting the activation space of transformer-based language models (LMs).
However, SAEs suffer several shortcomings that diminish their utility and
internal validity. Since SAEs are trained post-hoc, it is unclear if the
failure to discover a particular concept is a failure on the SAE's side or due
to the underlying LM not representing this concept. This problem is exacerbated
by training conditions and architecture choices affecting which features an SAE
learns. When tracing how LMs learn concepts during training, the lack of
feature stability also makes it difficult to compare SAEs features across
different checkpoints. To address these limitations, we introduce a
modification to the transformer architecture that incorporates a TopK
activation function at chosen layers, making the model's hidden states
equivalent to the latent features of a TopK SAE. This approach eliminates the
need for post-hoc training while providing interpretability comparable to SAEs.
The resulting TopK LMs offer a favorable trade-off between model size,
computational efficiency, and interpretability. Despite this simple
architectural change, TopK LMs maintain their original capabilities while
providing robust interpretability benefits. Our experiments demonstrate that
the sparse representations learned by TopK LMs enable successful steering
through targeted neuron interventions and facilitate detailed analysis of
neuron formation processes across checkpoints and layers. These features make
TopK LMs stable and reliable tools for understanding how language models learn
and represent concepts, which we believe will significantly advance future
research on model interpretability and controllability.

Motivation: 探索强化学习在大型语言模型微调中的有效性，特别是在不同任务类型和训练模式下的表现差异。

Method: 使用Direct Preference Optimization和Group Reward Policy Optimization目标，在可验证数学和不可验证指令跟随任务上进行实验。

Result: 在线和半在线方法表现相似且优于离线方法，多任务联合训练可提升性能。

Conclusion: 在线和半在线强化学习方法在微调大型语言模型时表现优异，多任务联合训练有助于提升性能。

Abstract: We investigate the effectiveness of reinforcement learning methods for
finetuning large language models when transitioning from offline to semi-online
to fully online regimes for both verifiable and non-verifiable tasks. Our
experiments cover training on verifiable math as well as non-verifiable
instruction following with a set of benchmark evaluations for both. Across
these settings, we extensively compare online and semi-online Direct Preference
Optimization and Group Reward Policy Optimization objectives, and surprisingly
find similar performance and convergence between these variants, which all
strongly outperform offline methods. We provide a detailed analysis of the
training dynamics and hyperparameter selection strategies to achieve optimal
results. Finally, we show that multi-tasking with verifiable and non-verifiable
rewards jointly yields improved performance across both task types.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过未来对话信号优化交互式LLM，提升用户参与度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未能明确保证用户参与度，需更直接的指标优化模型。

Method: 利用用户反应作为奖励，结合i×MCTS和DPO优化模型。

Result: 在情感支持和说服对话中有效提升用户参与度。

Conclusion: 方法显著提升交互式LLM的用户参与度。

Abstract: Enhancing user engagement through interactions plays an essential role in
socially-driven dialogues. While prior works have optimized models to reason
over relevant knowledge or plan a dialogue act flow, the relationship between
user engagement and knowledge or dialogue acts is subtle and does not guarantee
user engagement in socially-driven dialogues. To this end, we enable
interactive LLMs to learn user engagement by leveraging signals from the future
development of conversations. Specifically, we adopt a more direct and relevant
indicator of user engagement, i.e., the user's reaction related to dialogue
intention after the interaction, as a reward to align interactive LLMs. To
achieve this, we develop a user simulator to interact with target interactive
LLMs and explore interactions between the user and the interactive LLM system
via \textit{i$\times$MCTS} (\textit{M}onte \textit{C}arlo \textit{T}ree
\textit{S}earch for \textit{i}nteraction). In this way, we collect a dataset
containing pairs of higher and lower-quality experiences using
\textit{i$\times$MCTS}, and align interactive LLMs for high-level user
engagement by direct preference optimization (DPO) accordingly. Experiments
conducted on two socially-driven dialogue scenarios (emotional support
conversations and persuasion for good) demonstrate that our method effectively
enhances user engagement in interactive LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基准测试（如AP考试）用于评估LLM和人类，但若LLM的错误与人类不同，则测试结果可能只是表面理解（Potemkin理解）。

Method: 提出了两种量化Potemkin理解的方法：一种基于特定设计的基准测试，另一种提供其普遍性的下限估计。

Result: 研究发现Potemkin理解在模型、任务和领域中普遍存在，且反映了概念表征的内部不一致性。

Conclusion: 基准测试可能无法真实反映LLM的理解能力，需更深入的方法评估其概念表征的连贯性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are regularly evaluated using benchmark
datasets. But what justifies making inferences about an LLM's capabilities
based on its answers to a curated set of questions? This paper first introduces
a formal framework to address this question. The key is to note that the
benchmarks used to test LLMs -- such as AP exams -- are also those used to test
people. However, this raises an implication: these benchmarks are only valid
tests if LLMs misunderstand concepts in ways that mirror human
misunderstandings. Otherwise, success on benchmarks only demonstrates potemkin
understanding: the illusion of understanding driven by answers irreconcilable
with how any human would interpret a concept. We present two procedures for
quantifying the existence of potemkins: one using a specially designed
benchmark in three domains, the other using a general procedure that provides a
lower-bound on their prevalence. We find that potemkins are ubiquitous across
models, tasks, and domains. We also find that these failures reflect not just
incorrect understanding, but deeper internal incoherence in concept
representations.

Motivation: 研究用户通过LLMs获取医疗信息的交互行为及其风险，填补这一领域的空白。

Method: 通过过滤大规模对话数据集构建HealthChat-11K，并结合临床分类法分析21个医疗领域的用户交互。

Result: 发现用户交互模式（如不完整上下文、情感行为、诱导性问题等），凸显LLMs在医疗支持中的改进需求。

Conclusion: LLMs作为医疗对话AI需进一步优化，以更好地支持用户需求。

Abstract: People are increasingly seeking healthcare information from large language
models (LLMs) via interactive chatbots, yet the nature and inherent risks of
these conversations remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we filter
large-scale conversational AI datasets to achieve HealthChat-11K, a curated
dataset of 11K real-world conversations composed of 25K user messages. We use
HealthChat-11K and a clinician-driven taxonomy for how users interact with LLMs
when seeking healthcare information in order to systematically study user
interactions across 21 distinct health specialties. Our analysis reveals
insights into the nature of how and why users seek health information, such as
common interactions, instances of incomplete context, affective behaviors, and
interactions (e.g., leading questions) that can induce sycophancy, underscoring
the need for improvements in the healthcare support capabilities of LLMs
deployed as conversational AI. Code and artifacts to retrieve our analyses and
combine them into a curated dataset can be found here:

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为DELT的新范式，通过优化训练数据的组织（数据效能）来提升语言模型性能，包括数据评分、选择和排序三个组件。实验表明，DELT在不增加数据量和模型规模的情况下显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究主要关注数据效率（如数据筛选和采样），而数据效能（即数据组织优化）尚未充分探索。本文旨在填补这一空白，通过优化数据组织提升模型性能。

Method: 提出DELT范式，包含数据评分（如LQS）、数据选择和数据排序（如FO）。LQS从梯度一致性角度评估数据的可学习性和质量，FO解决模型遗忘和数据分布偏差问题。

Result: 实验表明，DELT在不增加数据量和模型规模的情况下显著提升了语言模型性能，尤其是LQS和FO的组合效果最佳。数据效能与数据效率可协同实现。

Conclusion: 数据效能是语言模型训练中一个重要的基础研究方向，DELT为其提供了通用框架，未来潜力巨大。

Abstract: Data is fundamental to the training of language models (LM). Recent research
has been dedicated to data efficiency, which aims to maximize performance by
selecting a minimal or optimal subset of training data. Techniques such as data
filtering, sampling, and selection play a crucial role in this area. To
complement it, we define Data Efficacy, which focuses on maximizing performance
by optimizing the organization of training data and remains relatively
underexplored. This work introduces a general paradigm, DELT, for considering
data efficacy in LM training, which highlights the significance of training
data organization. DELT comprises three components: Data Scoring, Data
Selection, and Data Ordering. Among these components, we design
Learnability-Quality Scoring (LQS), as a new instance of Data Scoring, which
considers both the learnability and quality of each data sample from the
gradient consistency perspective. We also devise Folding Ordering (FO), as a
novel instance of Data Ordering, which addresses issues such as model
forgetting and data distribution bias. Comprehensive experiments validate the
data efficacy in LM training, which demonstrates the following: Firstly,
various instances of the proposed DELT enhance LM performance to varying
degrees without increasing the data scale and model size. Secondly, among these
instances, the combination of our proposed LQS for data scoring and Folding for
data ordering achieves the most significant improvement. Lastly, data efficacy
can be achieved together with data efficiency by applying data selection.
Therefore, we believe that data efficacy is a promising foundational area in LM
training.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OTSurv是一种基于最优传输的多实例学习框架，用于全切片图像的生存预测，通过全局和局部约束解决病理异质性问题，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MIL方法未能明确捕捉全切片图像中的病理异质性，包括全局的长尾形态分布和局部的瓦片级预测不确定性。

Method: OTSurv将生存预测建模为带有全局长尾约束和局部不确定性约束的最优传输问题，并通过矩阵缩放算法高效求解。

Result: 在六个基准测试中，OTSurv的平均C-index提高了3.6%，且在统计显著性测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: OTSurv是一种高效且可解释的生存预测工具，适用于数字病理学。

Abstract: Survival prediction using whole slide images (WSIs) can be formulated as a
multiple instance learning (MIL) problem. However, existing MIL methods often
fail to explicitly capture pathological heterogeneity within WSIs, both
globally -- through long-tailed morphological distributions, and locally
through -- tile-level prediction uncertainty. Optimal transport (OT) provides a
principled way of modeling such heterogeneity by incorporating marginal
distribution constraints. Building on this insight, we propose OTSurv, a novel
MIL framework from an optimal transport perspective. Specifically, OTSurv
formulates survival predictions as a heterogeneity-aware OT problem with two
constraints: (1) global long-tail constraint that models prior morphological
distributions to avert both mode collapse and excessive uniformity by
regulating transport mass allocation, and (2) local uncertainty-aware
constraint that prioritizes high-confidence patches while suppressing noise by
progressively raising the total transport mass. We then recast the initial OT
problem, augmented by these constraints, into an unbalanced OT formulation that
can be solved with an efficient, hardware-friendly matrix scaling algorithm.
Empirically, OTSurv sets new state-of-the-art results across six popular
benchmarks, achieving an absolute 3.6% improvement in average C-index. In
addition, OTSurv achieves statistical significance in log-rank tests and offers
high interpretability, making it a powerful tool for survival prediction in
digital pathology. Our codes are available at

TL;DR: StereoDiff结合立体匹配和视频深度扩散，分别处理静态和动态区域的视频深度估计，实现了更高的准确性和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频深度估计不应简单地扩展图像深度估计方法，因为静态和动态区域的时序一致性需求不同。静态区域可通过立体匹配获得全局3D线索，而动态区域需通过大规模视频数据学习平滑过渡。

Method: 提出StereoDiff，分两阶段：立体匹配处理静态区域，视频深度扩散处理动态区域，并通过频域分析展示两者的互补性。

Result: 在零样本、真实世界和动态视频深度基准测试中，StereoDiff表现出最先进的性能，具有更高的深度一致性和准确性。

Conclusion: StereoDiff通过结合立体匹配和视频深度扩散，显著提升了视频深度估计的性能，适用于室内外场景。

Abstract: Recent video depth estimation methods achieve great performance by following
the paradigm of image depth estimation, i.e., typically fine-tuning pre-trained
video diffusion models with massive data. However, we argue that video depth
estimation is not a naive extension of image depth estimation. The temporal
consistency requirements for dynamic and static regions in videos are
fundamentally different. Consistent video depth in static regions, typically
backgrounds, can be more effectively achieved via stereo matching across all
frames, which provides much stronger global 3D cues. While the consistency for
dynamic regions still should be learned from large-scale video depth data to
ensure smooth transitions, due to the violation of triangulation constraints.
Based on these insights, we introduce StereoDiff, a two-stage video depth
estimator that synergizes stereo matching for mainly the static areas with
video depth diffusion for maintaining consistent depth transitions in dynamic
areas. We mathematically demonstrate how stereo matching and video depth
diffusion offer complementary strengths through frequency domain analysis,
highlighting the effectiveness of their synergy in capturing the advantages of
both. Experimental results on zero-shot, real-world, dynamic video depth
benchmarks, both indoor and outdoor, demonstrate StereoDiff's SoTA performance,
showcasing its superior consistency and accuracy in video depth estimation.

Motivation: 视觉和触觉是机器人感知和操作任务中的两种互补感官模态，但现有方法在模态融合时特征整合效果不佳。

Method: ConViTac采用对比嵌入条件（CEC）机制，通过自监督对比学习预训练的对比编码器，将视觉和触觉输入投影到统一的潜在嵌入中，并通过跨模态注意力实现特征融合。

Conclusion: ConViTac通过对比表示和跨模态注意力机制，显著提升了视觉-触觉特征融合的效果，为机器人感知任务提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision and touch are two fundamental sensory modalities for robots, offering
complementary information that enhances perception and manipulation tasks.
Previous research has attempted to jointly learn visual-tactile representations
to extract more meaningful information. However, these approaches often rely on
direct combination, such as feature addition and concatenation, for modality
fusion, which tend to result in poor feature integration. In this paper, we
propose ConViTac, a visual-tactile representation learning network designed to
enhance the alignment of features during fusion using contrastive
representations. Our key contribution is a Contrastive Embedding Conditioning
(CEC) mechanism that leverages a contrastive encoder pretrained through
self-supervised contrastive learning to project visual and tactile inputs into
unified latent embeddings. These embeddings are used to couple visual-tactile
feature fusion through cross-modal attention, aiming at aligning the unified
representations and enhancing performance on downstream tasks. We conduct
extensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority of ConViTac in real world
over current state-of-the-art methods and the effectiveness of our proposed CEC
mechanism, which improves accuracy by up to 12.0% in material classification
and grasping prediction tasks.

Motivation: 当前连续手语识别（CSLR）面临数据集不足和标注不精确的问题，且现有方法未充分利用文本模态的知识。

Method: 构建层次化子动作树（HST）表示文本信息，逐步对齐视觉和文本模态，并通过对比对齐增强减少模态差异。

Result: 在四个数据集（PHOENIX-2014、PHOENIX-2014T、CSL-Daily和Sign Language Gesture）上验证了HST-CSLR的有效性。

Conclusion: HST-CSLR通过结合文本知识和层次化对齐，显著提升了连续手语识别的性能。

Abstract: Continuous sign language recognition (CSLR) aims to transcribe untrimmed
videos into glosses, which are typically textual words. Recent studies indicate
that the lack of large datasets and precise annotations has become a bottleneck
for CSLR due to insufficient training data. To address this, some works have
developed cross-modal solutions to align visual and textual modalities.
However, they typically extract textual features from glosses without fully
utilizing their knowledge. In this paper, we propose the Hierarchical
Sub-action Tree (HST), termed HST-CSLR, to efficiently combine gloss knowledge
with visual representation learning. By incorporating gloss-specific knowledge
from large language models, our approach leverages textual information more
effectively. Specifically, we construct an HST for textual information
representation, aligning visual and textual modalities step-by-step and
benefiting from the tree structure to reduce computational complexity.
Additionally, we impose a contrastive alignment enhancement to bridge the gap
between the two modalities. Experiments on four datasets (PHOENIX-2014,
PHOENIX-2014T, CSL-Daily, and Sign Language Gesture) demonstrate the
effectiveness of our HST-CSLR.

Method: 使用SAM、SAM 2、MedSAM等模型在BraTS 2023数据集上进行零样本推理，并通过微调评估性能。

Result: SAM和SAM 2在精确边界框提示下表现优异（Dice分数达0.894），但nnU-Net仍更实用。微调后点提示性能显著提升。

Conclusion: 可提示模型在精确提示下潜力大，但nnU-Net仍是医学图像分割的首选。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation has greatly aided medical diagnosis, with U-Net
based architectures and nnU-Net providing state-of-the-art performance. There
have been numerous general promptable models and medical variations introduced
in recent years, but there is currently a lack of evaluation and comparison of
these models across a variety of prompt qualities on a common medical dataset.
This research uses Segment Anything Model (SAM), Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM
2), MedSAM, SAM-Med-3D, and nnU-Net to obtain zero-shot inference on the BraTS
2023 adult glioma and pediatrics dataset across multiple prompt qualities for
both points and bounding boxes. Several of these models exhibit promising Dice
scores, particularly SAM and SAM 2 achieving scores of up to 0.894 and 0.893,
respectively when given extremely accurate bounding box prompts which exceeds
nnU-Net's segmentation performance. However, nnU-Net remains the dominant
medical image segmentation network due to the impracticality of providing
highly accurate prompts to the models. The model and prompt evaluation, as well
as the comparison, are extended through fine-tuning SAM, SAM 2, MedSAM, and
SAM-Med-3D on the pediatrics dataset. The improvements in point prompt
performance after fine-tuning are substantial and show promise for future
investigation, but are unable to achieve better segmentation than bounding
boxes or nnU-Net.

TL;DR: 提出了一种逐步生成视频到音频的方法，通过分步生成特定声音事件的音频轨道，模仿传统Foley工作流程，并利用文本提示和先前生成的音频进行引导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频到音频生成方法难以全面捕捉视频中的所有声音事件，因此需要一种更全面的方法。

Method: 采用分步生成策略，每步生成特定声音事件的音频轨道，利用文本提示和先前音频进行引导，并基于预训练模型训练框架。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能为单个视频生成多个语义不同的音频轨道，合成音频质量优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 该方法通过分步生成和引导策略，显著提升了视频到音频合成的质量和多样性。

Abstract: We propose a novel step-by-step video-to-audio generation method that
sequentially produces individual audio tracks, each corresponding to a specific
sound event in the video. Our approach mirrors traditional Foley workflows,
aiming to capture all sound events induced by a given video comprehensively.
Each generation step is formulated as a guided video-to-audio synthesis task,
conditioned on a target text prompt and previously generated audio tracks. This
design is inspired by the idea of concept negation from prior compositional
generation frameworks. To enable this guided generation, we introduce a
training framework that leverages pre-trained video-to-audio models and
eliminates the need for specialized paired datasets, allowing training on more
accessible data. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates
multiple semantically distinct audio tracks for a single input video, leading
to higher-quality composite audio synthesis than existing baselines.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了基于视觉基础模型（VFM）和视觉语言模型（VLM）的动态全身手势识别，比较了V-JEPA、Gemini Flash 2.0和HD-GCN的性能，并提出了NUGGET数据集。HD-GCN表现最佳，但V-JEPA接近，展示了简化系统复杂性的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在嘈杂环境中（如敏捷生产），手势是非人机通信的重要方式。传统深度学习方法依赖任务特定架构，而VFM和VLM的强泛化能力可能简化系统。

Method: 比较了V-JEPA（VFM）、Gemini Flash 2.0（VLM）和HD-GCN（骨架方法）在动态全身手势识别中的表现，使用NUGGET数据集进行评估。

Result: HD-GCN性能最佳，V-JEPA接近，仅需简单分类头；Gemini在零样本设置中表现不佳。

Conclusion: V-JEPA展示了作为共享多任务模型的潜力，但需进一步研究适合手势的输入表示。

Abstract: Gestures enable non-verbal human-robot communication, especially in noisy
environments like agile production. Traditional deep learning-based gesture
recognition relies on task-specific architectures using images, videos, or
skeletal pose estimates as input. Meanwhile, Vision Foundation Models (VFMs)
and Vision Language Models (VLMs) with their strong generalization abilities
offer potential to reduce system complexity by replacing dedicated
task-specific modules. This study investigates adapting such models for
dynamic, full-body gesture recognition, comparing V-JEPA (a state-of-the-art
VFM), Gemini Flash 2.0 (a multimodal VLM), and HD-GCN (a top-performing
skeleton-based approach). We introduce NUGGET, a dataset tailored for
human-robot communication in intralogistics environments, to evaluate the
different gesture recognition approaches. In our experiments, HD-GCN achieves
best performance, but V-JEPA comes close with a simple, task-specific
classification head - thus paving a possible way towards reducing system
complexity, by using it as a shared multi-task model. In contrast, Gemini
struggles to differentiate gestures based solely on textual descriptions in the
zero-shot setting, highlighting the need of further research on suitable input
representations for gestures.

*Cansu Korkmaz,Ahmet Murat Tekalp,Zafer Dogan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用视觉语言模型（VLM）从扩散模型生成的高分辨率图像中选择最可信样本的自动化框架，并通过混合指标（TWS）量化其可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超分辨率（SR）问题存在多个解，传统方法在平衡保真度和感知质量时可能引入信息模糊的伪影，而扩散模型生成的多样解缺乏可信度评估标准。

Method: 利用BLIP-2、GPT-4o等VLM通过结构化查询评估语义正确性、视觉质量和伪影，并通过TWS（结合CLIP嵌入、SSIM和小波分解）量化可靠性。

Result: 实验表明TWS与人类偏好高度相关，且VLM引导的选择能持续获得高TWS值，优于传统指标（如PSNR、LPIPS）。

Conclusion: 该方法为生成式SR提供了可扩展、通用的可信度评估方案，设定了新的可信度基准。

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) is an ill-posed inverse problem with many feasible
solutions consistent with a given low-resolution image. On one hand, regressive
SR models aim to balance fidelity and perceptual quality to yield a single
solution, but this trade-off often introduces artifacts that create ambiguity
in information-critical applications such as recognizing digits or letters. On
the other hand, diffusion models generate a diverse set of SR images, but
selecting the most trustworthy solution from this set remains a challenge. This
paper introduces a robust, automated framework for identifying the most
trustworthy SR sample from a diffusion-generated set by leveraging the semantic
reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs). Specifically, VLMs
such as BLIP-2, GPT-4o, and their variants are prompted with structured queries
to assess semantic correctness, visual quality, and artifact presence. The
top-ranked SR candidates are then ensembled to yield a single trustworthy
output in a cost-effective manner. To rigorously assess the validity of
VLM-selected samples, we propose a novel Trustworthiness Score (TWS) a hybrid
metric that quantifies SR reliability based on three complementary components:
semantic similarity via CLIP embeddings, structural integrity using SSIM on
edge maps, and artifact sensitivity through multi-level wavelet decomposition.
We empirically show that TWS correlates strongly with human preference in both
ambiguous and natural images, and that VLM-guided selections consistently yield
high TWS values. Compared to conventional metrics like PSNR, LPIPS, which fail
to reflect information fidelity, our approach offers a principled, scalable,
and generalizable solution for navigating the uncertainty of the diffusion SR
space. By aligning outputs with human expectations and semantic correctness,
this work sets a new benchmark for trustworthiness in generative SR.

Result: 设计了一个分层评估协议，验证模型在具身预测和控制任务中的表现。

Conclusion: 该研究为从人类视角预测视频和建模复杂环境提供了初步尝试。

Abstract: We train models to Predict Ego-centric Video from human Actions (PEVA), given
the past video and an action represented by the relative 3D body pose. By
conditioning on kinematic pose trajectories, structured by the joint hierarchy
of the body, our model learns to simulate how physical human actions shape the
environment from a first-person point of view. We train an auto-regressive
conditional diffusion transformer on Nymeria, a large-scale dataset of
real-world egocentric video and body pose capture. We further design a
hierarchical evaluation protocol with increasingly challenging tasks, enabling
a comprehensive analysis of the model's embodied prediction and control
abilities. Our work represents an initial attempt to tackle the challenges of
modeling complex real-world environments and embodied agent behaviors with
video prediction from the perspective of a human.

TL;DR: FixCLR是一种新的半监督领域泛化方法，通过对比学习显式正则化领域不变表示，提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决半监督领域泛化中标签稀缺导致性能不足的问题，现有方法未显式正则化领域不变表示。

Method: 引入FixCLR，利用伪标签的类别信息和排斥项，适应对比学习以实现领域不变性。

Result: FixCLR显著提升性能，尤其在与其他半监督方法结合时表现更优。

Conclusion: FixCLR是有效的SSDG方法，适用于多领域数据集，并能与其他方法互补。

Abstract: Semi-supervised domain generalization (SSDG) aims to solve the problem of
generalizing to out-of-distribution data when only a few labels are available.
Due to label scarcity, applying domain generalization methods often
underperform. Consequently, existing SSDG methods combine semi-supervised
learning methods with various regularization terms. However, these methods do
not explicitly regularize to learn domains invariant representations across all
domains, which is a key goal for domain generalization. To address this, we
introduce FixCLR. Inspired by success in self-supervised learning, we change
two crucial components to adapt contrastive learning for explicit domain
invariance regularization: utilization of class information from pseudo-labels
and using only a repelling term. FixCLR can also be added on top of most
existing SSDG and semi-supervised methods for complementary performance
improvements. Our research includes extensive experiments that have not been
previously explored in SSDG studies. These experiments include benchmarking
different improvements to semi-supervised methods, evaluating the performance
of pretrained versus non-pretrained models, and testing on datasets with many
domains. Overall, FixCLR proves to be an effective SSDG method, especially when
combined with other semi-supervised methods.

*Yuting He,Shuo Li*

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为COVER的向量对比学习框架，解决了传统对比学习在像素级表示中的过分散问题，提升了医学视觉基础模型的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对比学习（CL）在自监督预训练（SSP）中表现优异，但在像素级表示中存在过分散问题，破坏了像素级特征相关性。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出向量对比学习（vector CL），将CL重新定义为向量回归问题，通过COVER框架实现向量自学习、优化流一致性和粒度适应。

Result: 在8个任务、2个维度和4种模态的实验中，COVER显著提升了像素级SSP性能。

Conclusion: COVER框架有效解决了像素级表示中的过分散问题，为医学视觉基础模型提供了更强的泛化能力。

Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) has become a cornerstone of self-supervised
pretraining (SSP) in foundation models, however, extending CL to pixel-wise
representation, crucial for medical vision, remains an open problem. Standard
CL formulates SSP as a binary optimization problem (binary CL) where the
excessive pursuit of feature dispersion leads to an over-dispersion problem,
breaking pixel-wise feature correlation thus disrupting the intra-class
distribution. Our vector CL reformulates CL as a vector regression problem,
enabling dispersion quantification in pixel-wise pretraining via modeling
feature distances in regressing displacement vectors. To implement this novel
paradigm, we propose the COntrast in VEctor Regression (COVER) framework. COVER
establishes an extendable vector-based self-learning, enforces a consistent
optimization flow from vector regression to distance modeling, and leverages a
vector pyramid architecture for granularity adaptation, thus preserving
pixel-wise feature correlations in SSP. Extensive experiments across 8 tasks,
spanning 2 dimensions and 4 modalities, show that COVER significantly improves
pixel-wise SSP, advancing generalizable medical visual foundation models.

TL;DR: MIDAS是一种数据增强方法，通过软标签和视频帧的凸组合提升动态面部表情识别（DFER）性能，尤其在处理模糊表情时表现优异。


<details>

Motivation: 解决动态面部表情识别中模糊表情的准确识别问题，提升模型在真实场景中的表现。

Method: 提出MIDAS方法，通过软标签和视频帧的凸组合进行数据增强，扩展了mixup方法至视频数据。

Result: 在DFEW和FERV39k-Plus数据集上，MIDAS训练出的模型性能优于现有最佳方法。

Conclusion: MIDAS是一种简单高效的数据增强方法，显著提升了DFER任务中模糊表情的识别能力。

Abstract: Dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER) is a task that estimates
emotions from facial expression video sequences. For practical applications,
accurately recognizing ambiguous facial expressions -- frequently encountered
in in-the-wild data -- is essential. In this study, we propose MIDAS, a data
augmentation method designed to enhance DFER performance for ambiguous facial
expression data using soft labels representing probabilities of multiple
emotion classes. MIDAS augments training data by convexly combining pairs of
video frames and their corresponding emotion class labels. This approach
extends mixup to soft-labeled video data, offering a simple yet highly
effective method for handling ambiguity in DFER. To evaluate MIDAS, we
conducted experiments on both the DFEW dataset and FERV39k-Plus, a newly
constructed dataset that assigns soft labels to an existing DFER dataset. The
results demonstrate that models trained with MIDAS-augmented data achieve
superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art method trained on the
original dataset.

*Calin Teodor Ioan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ThirdEye是一种单目深度估计方法，通过预训练的专家网络显式提供视觉线索，并结合三层皮层层次结构和自适应分箱变换器生成高分辨率视差图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法通过隐式学习直接从RGB像素推断深度，忽略了人类视觉系统依赖的显式单目线索（如遮挡边界、阴影和透视）。ThirdEye旨在通过显式提供这些线索改进深度估计。

Method: ThirdEye使用预训练且冻结的专家网络提供视觉线索，通过三层皮层层次结构（V1->V2->V3）和键值工作记忆模块融合线索，并用自适应分箱变换器生成视差图。

Result: 由于冻结了专家网络，ThirdEye继承了大量外部监督，仅需少量微调。具体定量结果将在未来版本中公布。

Conclusion: ThirdEye通过显式利用视觉线索改进了单目深度估计，减少了模型对隐式学习的依赖，同时继承了预训练模型的优势。

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation methods traditionally train deep models to infer
depth directly from RGB pixels. This implicit learning often overlooks explicit
monocular cues that the human visual system relies on, such as occlusion
boundaries, shading, and perspective. Rather than expecting a network to
discover these cues unaided, we present ThirdEye, a cue-aware pipeline that
deliberately supplies each cue through specialised, pre-trained, and frozen
networks. These cues are fused in a three-stage cortical hierarchy (V1->V2->V3)
equipped with a key-value working-memory module that weights them by
reliability. An adaptive-bins transformer head then produces a high-resolution
disparity map. Because the cue experts are frozen, ThirdEye inherits large
amounts of external supervision while requiring only modest fine-tuning. This
extended version provides additional architectural detail, neuroscientific
motivation, and an expanded experimental protocol; quantitative results will
appear in a future revision.

Abstract: Generation of images containing multiple humans, performing complex actions,
while preserving their facial identities, is a significant challenge. A major
factor contributing to this is the lack of a a dedicated benchmark. To address
this, we introduce MultiHuman-Testbench, a novel benchmark for rigorously
evaluating generative models for multi-human generation. The benchmark
comprises 1800 samples, including carefully curated text prompts, describing a
range of simple to complex human actions. These prompts are matched with a
total of 5,550 unique human face images, sampled uniformly to ensure diversity
across age, ethnic background, and gender. Alongside captions, we provide
human-selected pose conditioning images which accurately match the prompt. We
propose a multi-faceted evaluation suite employing four key metrics to quantify
face count, ID similarity, prompt alignment, and action detection. We conduct a
thorough evaluation of a diverse set of models, including zero-shot approaches
and training-based methods, with and without regional priors. We also propose
novel techniques to incorporate image and region isolation using human
segmentation and Hungarian matching, significantly improving ID similarity. Our
proposed benchmark and key findings provide valuable insights and a
standardized tool for advancing research in multi-human image generation.

discontinuities. Our analysis includes the evaluation of stereo feature
matching quality derived from deep learning models, as well as the role of
attention mechanisms in recovering meaningful 3D surfaces. Through both
theoretical insights and empirical studies on real datasets, we demonstrate
that combining strong geometric priors with learned features provides internal
abstractions for understanding stereo vision systems.

Result: FaSTA*在计算效率上显著优于现有方法，同时保持与基线相当的成功率。

Conclusion: FaSTA*通过复用子程序显著降低成本，适用于复杂图像编辑任务。

Abstract: We develop a cost-efficient neurosymbolic agent to address challenging
multi-turn image editing tasks such as "Detect the bench in the image while
recoloring it to pink. Also, remove the cat for a clearer view and recolor the
wall to yellow.'' It combines the fast, high-level subtask planning by large
language models (LLMs) with the slow, accurate, tool-use, and local A$^*$
search per subtask to find a cost-efficient toolpath -- a sequence of calls to
AI tools. To save the cost of A$^*$ on similar subtasks, we perform inductive
reasoning on previously successful toolpaths via LLMs to continuously
extract/refine frequently used subroutines and reuse them as new tools for
future tasks in an adaptive fast-slow planning, where the higher-level
subroutines are explored first, and only when they fail, the low-level A$^*$
search is activated. The reusable symbolic subroutines considerably save
exploration cost on the same types of subtasks applied to similar images,
yielding a human-like fast-slow toolpath agent "FaSTA$^*$'': fast subtask
planning followed by rule-based subroutine selection per subtask is attempted
by LLMs at first, which is expected to cover most tasks, while slow A$^*$
search is only triggered for novel and challenging subtasks. By comparing with
recent image editing approaches, we demonstrate FaSTA$^*$ is significantly more
computationally efficient while remaining competitive with the state-of-the-art
baseline in terms of success rate.

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在像素级伪造定位中存在计算开销大和表示能力有限的问题，尤其是对复杂或细微篡改的处理不足。

Method: 提出M2SFormer框架，统一多频率和多尺度注意力，利用全局先验图和难度引导注意力模块保留细微篡改。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，M2SFormer优于现有最先进模型，表现出更强的泛化能力。

Conclusion: M2SFormer通过创新设计有效解决了伪造定位中的挑战，为图像编辑领域提供了更可靠的检测工具。

Abstract: Image editing techniques have rapidly advanced, facilitating both innovative
use cases and malicious manipulation of digital images. Deep learning-based
methods have recently achieved high accuracy in pixel-level forgery
localization, yet they frequently struggle with computational overhead and
limited representation power, particularly for subtle or complex tampering. In
this paper, we propose M2SFormer, a novel Transformer encoder-based framework
designed to overcome these challenges. Unlike approaches that process spatial
and frequency cues separately, M2SFormer unifies multi-frequency and
multi-scale attentions in the skip connection, harnessing global context to
better capture diverse forgery artifacts. Additionally, our framework addresses
the loss of fine detail during upsampling by utilizing a global prior map, a
curvature metric indicating the difficulty of forgery localization, which then
guides a difficulty-guided attention module to preserve subtle manipulations
more effectively. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets
demonstrate that M2SFormer outperforms existing state-of-the-art models,
offering superior generalization in detecting and localizing forgeries across
unseen domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LBS在模拟弹性材料（如软组织、毛发等）时存在不足，PhysRig旨在通过物理模拟生成更真实的结果。

Method: 将刚性骨架嵌入体积表示（如四面体网格），利用连续介质力学和粒子离散化确保可微性，并引入材料原型减少学习空间。

Result: PhysRig在合成数据集上表现优于传统LBS方法，生成更真实且物理合理的结果。

Conclusion: PhysRig为关节物体建模提供了更通用的解决方案，适用于姿态迁移等任务。

Abstract: Skinning and rigging are fundamental components in animation, articulated
object reconstruction, motion transfer, and 4D generation. Existing approaches
predominantly rely on Linear Blend Skinning (LBS), due to its simplicity and
differentiability. However, LBS introduces artifacts such as volume loss and
unnatural deformations, and it fails to model elastic materials like soft
tissues, fur, and flexible appendages (e.g., elephant trunks, ears, and fatty
tissues). In this work, we propose PhysRig: a differentiable physics-based
skinning and rigging framework that overcomes these limitations by embedding
the rigid skeleton into a volumetric representation (e.g., a tetrahedral mesh),
which is simulated as a deformable soft-body structure driven by the animated
skeleton. Our method leverages continuum mechanics and discretizes the object
as particles embedded in an Eulerian background grid to ensure
differentiability with respect to both material properties and skeletal motion.
Additionally, we introduce material prototypes, significantly reducing the
learning space while maintaining high expressiveness. To evaluate our
framework, we construct a comprehensive synthetic dataset using meshes from
Objaverse, The Amazing Animals Zoo, and MixaMo, covering diverse object
categories and motion patterns. Our method consistently outperforms traditional
LBS-based approaches, generating more realistic and physically plausible
results. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability of our framework in the
pose transfer task highlighting its versatility for articulated object
modeling.

Conclusion: PathChat+和SlideSeek为病理学AI提供了更强大的多模态理解和自主诊断能力。

Abstract: Pathology is experiencing rapid digital transformation driven by whole-slide
imaging and artificial intelligence (AI). While deep learning-based
computational pathology has achieved notable success, traditional models
primarily focus on image analysis without integrating natural language
instruction or rich, text-based context. Current multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) in computational pathology face limitations, including
insufficient training data, inadequate support and evaluation for multi-image
understanding, and a lack of autonomous, diagnostic reasoning capabilities. To
address these limitations, we introduce PathChat+, a new MLLM specifically
designed for human pathology, trained on over 1 million diverse,
pathology-specific instruction samples and nearly 5.5 million question answer
turns. Extensive evaluations across diverse pathology benchmarks demonstrated
that PathChat+ substantially outperforms the prior PathChat copilot, as well as
both state-of-the-art (SOTA) general-purpose and other pathology-specific
models. Furthermore, we present SlideSeek, a reasoning-enabled multi-agent AI
system leveraging PathChat+ to autonomously evaluate gigapixel whole-slide
images (WSIs) through iterative, hierarchical diagnostic reasoning, reaching
high accuracy on DDxBench, a challenging open-ended differential diagnosis
benchmark, while also capable of generating visually grounded,
humanly-interpretable summary reports.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DFVEdit是一种高效的零样本视频编辑方法，专为视频扩散变换器（Video DiTs）设计，避免了注意力修改和微调，通过流变换直接操作潜在空间，显著提升了计算效率和编辑质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频编辑方法在Video DiTs上应用时计算开销大，需要修改注意力机制或微调，导致效率低下。

Method: 提出DFVEdit，基于连续流视角统一编辑和采样，引入条件Delta流向量（CDFV），并结合隐式交叉注意力（ICA）和嵌入强化（ER）提升质量。

Result: DFVEdit在Video DiTs上实现了至少20倍推理加速和85%内存减少，并在结构保真度、时空一致性和编辑质量上达到SOTA。

Conclusion: DFVEdit是一种高效、高质量的Video DiTs编辑方法，具有广泛适用性和显著性能优势。

Abstract: The advent of Video Diffusion Transformers (Video DiTs) marks a milestone in
video generation. However, directly applying existing video editing methods to
Video DiTs often incurs substantial computational overhead, due to
resource-intensive attention modification or finetuning. To alleviate this
problem, we present DFVEdit, an efficient zero-shot video editing method
tailored for Video DiTs. DFVEdit eliminates the need for both attention
modification and fine-tuning by directly operating on clean latents via flow
transformation. To be more specific, we observe that editing and sampling can
be unified under the continuous flow perspective. Building upon this
foundation, we propose the Conditional Delta Flow Vector (CDFV) -- a
theoretically unbiased estimation of DFV -- and integrate Implicit Cross
Attention (ICA) guidance as well as Embedding Reinforcement (ER) to further
enhance editing quality. DFVEdit excels in practical efficiency, offering at
least 20x inference speed-up and 85\% memory reduction on Video DiTs compared
to attention-engineering-based editing methods. Extensive quantitative and
qualitative experiments demonstrate that DFVEdit can be seamlessly applied to
popular Video DiTs (e.g., CogVideoX and Wan2.1), attaining state-of-the-art
performance on structural fidelity, spatial-temporal consistency, and editing
quality.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Cradle2Cane的两阶段人脸老化框架，通过自适应噪声注入和身份感知嵌入解决了年龄准确性与身份一致性之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人脸老化方法难以在年龄准确性和身份一致性之间取得平衡，尤其是在处理大年龄跨度或极端头部姿势时。

Method: 采用两阶段扩散模型框架：第一阶段通过自适应噪声注入（AdaNI）实现年龄准确性；第二阶段通过身份感知嵌入（IDEmb）增强身份一致性。

Result: 在CelebA-HQ测试数据集上，Cradle2Cane在年龄准确性和身份一致性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Cradle2Cane通过两阶段设计有效解决了年龄与身份之间的权衡问题，为实际应用提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Face aging has become a crucial task in computer vision, with applications
ranging from entertainment to healthcare. However, existing methods struggle
with achieving a realistic and seamless transformation across the entire
lifespan, especially when handling large age gaps or extreme head poses. The
core challenge lies in balancing age accuracy and identity preservation--what
we refer to as the Age-ID trade-off. Most prior methods either prioritize age
transformation at the expense of identity consistency or vice versa. In this
work, we address this issue by proposing a two-pass face aging framework, named
Cradle2Cane, based on few-step text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models. The first
pass focuses on solving age accuracy by introducing an adaptive noise injection
(AdaNI) mechanism. This mechanism is guided by including prompt descriptions of
age and gender for the given person as the textual condition. Also, by
adjusting the noise level, we can control the strength of aging while allowing
more flexibility in transforming the face. However, identity preservation is
weakly ensured here to facilitate stronger age transformations. In the second
pass, we enhance identity preservation while maintaining age-specific features
by conditioning the model on two identity-aware embeddings (IDEmb): SVR-ArcFace
and Rotate-CLIP. This pass allows for denoising the transformed image from the
first pass, ensuring stronger identity preservation without compromising the
aging accuracy. Both passes are jointly trained in an end-to-end way. Extensive
experiments on the CelebA-HQ test dataset, evaluated through Face++ and Qwen-VL
protocols, show that our Cradle2Cane outperforms existing face aging methods in
age accuracy and identity consistency.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合相机光度优化的3D场景表示方法，通过光度模型和深度正则化，有效分离场景无关信息，提升表示质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 相机成像中的光度失真会降低图像质量，进而影响3D场景表示的准确性，需要一种方法来分离这些失真。

Method: 提出完整的光度模型和相机表示，结合光度参数优化和深度正则化，构建包含场景辐射场和相机光度模型的完整映射。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在成像退化条件下（如暗角和污垢）仍能生成高质量的3D场景表示。

Conclusion: 通过联合优化相机光度模型和场景表示，有效提升了3D场景重建的质量和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Representing scenes from multi-view images is a crucial task in computer
vision with extensive applications. However, inherent photometric distortions
in the camera imaging can significantly degrade image quality. Without
accounting for these distortions, the 3D scene representation may inadvertently
incorporate erroneous information unrelated to the scene, diminishing the
quality of the representation. In this paper, we propose a novel 3D
scene-camera representation with joint camera photometric optimization. By
introducing internal and external photometric model, we propose a full
photometric model and corresponding camera representation. Based on
simultaneously optimizing the parameters of the camera representation, the
proposed method effectively separates scene-unrelated information from the 3D
scene representation. Additionally, during the optimization of the photometric
parameters, we introduce a depth regularization to prevent the 3D scene
representation from fitting scene-unrelated information. By incorporating the
camera model as part of the mapping process, the proposed method constructs a
complete map that includes both the scene radiance field and the camera
photometric model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
can achieve high-quality 3D scene representations, even under conditions of
imaging degradation, such as vignetting and dirt.

Conclusion: GoIRL框架在轨迹预测任务中表现出色，为自动驾驶提供了更灵活和准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Trajectory prediction for surrounding agents is a challenging task in
autonomous driving due to its inherent uncertainty and underlying
multimodality. Unlike prevailing data-driven methods that primarily rely on
supervised learning, in this paper, we introduce a novel Graph-oriented Inverse
Reinforcement Learning (GoIRL) framework, which is an IRL-based predictor
equipped with vectorized context representations. We develop a feature adaptor
to effectively aggregate lane-graph features into grid space, enabling seamless
integration with the maximum entropy IRL paradigm to infer the reward
distribution and obtain the policy that can be sampled to induce multiple
plausible plans. Furthermore, conditioned on the sampled plans, we implement a
hierarchical parameterized trajectory generator with a refinement module to
enhance prediction accuracy and a probability fusion strategy to boost
prediction confidence. Extensive experimental results showcase our approach not
only achieves state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale Argoverse &
nuScenes motion forecasting benchmarks but also exhibits superior
generalization abilities compared to existing supervised models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 密集信号在姿态引导的图像生成中引发了新的挑战，如编辑困难和与文本提示的不一致性，因此作者重新审视稀疏信号的潜力，因其简单性和形状无关性。

Method: 扩展OpenPose为可学习的空间表示，并通过关键点概念学习增强关键点嵌入的表达能力，从而提升姿态对齐。

Conclusion: SP-Ctrl证明了稀疏信号在姿态引导图像生成中的有效性，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recent works favored dense signals (e.g., depth, DensePose), as an
alternative to sparse signals (e.g., OpenPose), to provide detailed spatial
guidance for pose-guided text-to-image generation. However, dense
representations raised new challenges, including editing difficulties and
potential inconsistencies with textual prompts. This fact motivates us to
revisit sparse signals for pose guidance, owing to their simplicity and
shape-agnostic nature, which remains underexplored. This paper proposes a novel
Spatial-Pose ControlNet(SP-Ctrl), equipping sparse signals with robust
controllability for pose-guided image generation. Specifically, we extend
OpenPose to a learnable spatial representation, making keypoint embeddings
discriminative and expressive. Additionally, we introduce keypoint concept
learning, which encourages keypoint tokens to attend to the spatial positions
of each keypoint, thus improving pose alignment. Experiments on animal- and
human-centric image generation tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms
recent spatially controllable T2I generation approaches under sparse-pose
guidance and even matches the performance of dense signal-based methods.
Moreover, SP-Ctrl shows promising capabilities in diverse and cross-species
generation through sparse signals. Codes will be available at

Result: OccOoD在OoD检测上达到67.34% AuROC和29.21% AuPRCr，同时保持占用预测性能。

Conclusion: OccOoD在OoD检测和语义占用预测上表现优异，数据集和代码将开源。

Abstract: 3D Semantic Occupancy Prediction is crucial for autonomous driving, providing
a dense, semantically rich environmental representation. However, existing
methods focus on in-distribution scenes, making them susceptible to
Out-of-Distribution (OoD) objects and long-tail distributions, which increases
the risk of undetected anomalies and misinterpretations, posing safety hazards.
To address these challenges, we introduce Out-of-Distribution Semantic
Occupancy Prediction, targeting OoD detection in 3D voxel space. To fill the
gaps in the dataset, we propose a Synthetic Anomaly Integration Pipeline that
injects synthetic anomalies while preserving realistic spatial and occlusion
patterns, enabling the creation of two datasets: VAA-KITTI and VAA-KITTI-360.
We introduce OccOoD, a novel framework integrating OoD detection into 3D
semantic occupancy prediction, with Voxel-BEV Progressive Fusion (VBPF)
leveraging an RWKV-based branch to enhance OoD detection via geometry-semantic
fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that OccOoD achieves state-of-the-art
OoD detection with an AuROC of 67.34% and an AuPRCr of 29.21% within a 1.2m
region, while maintaining competitive occupancy prediction performance. The
established datasets and source code will be made publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CZSL方法通过简单组合原型映射学习原始特征，忽略了语义子集和组合差异，导致图像-组合对齐不精细。

Method: 提出EVA框架，结合领域专家适应和多专家模型实现令牌感知学习，并通过语义变体对齐选择相关表示进行匹配。

Result: 在三个流行基准测试中，EVA在封闭和开放世界设置下均显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: EVA框架通过改进原始特征学习和图像-组合对齐，显著提升了CZSL的性能。

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) investigates compositional
generalization capacity to recognize unknown state-object pairs based on
learned primitive concepts. Existing CZSL methods typically derive primitives
features through a simple composition-prototype mapping, which is suboptimal
for a set of individuals that can be divided into distinct semantic subsets.
Moreover, the all-to-one cross-modal primitives matching neglects compositional
divergence within identical states or objects, limiting fine-grained
image-composition alignment. In this study, we propose EVA, a
Mixture-of-Experts Semantic Variant Alignment framework for CZSL. Specifically,
we introduce domain-expert adaption, leveraging multiple experts to achieve
token-aware learning and model high-quality primitive representations. To
enable accurate compositional generalization, we further present semantic
variant alignment to select semantically relevant representation for
image-primitives matching. Our method significantly outperforms other
state-of-the-art CZSL methods on three popular benchmarks in both closed- and
open-world settings, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed insight.

Motivation: 全景图像处理面临失真、遮挡和标注不足等问题，传统无监督域适应方法依赖源数据，限制了实用性。

Method: 提出UNLOCK框架，包含Omni Pseudo-Labeling Learning和Amodal-Driven Context Learning模块，无需源数据或目标标签。

Result: 实验显示UNLOCK性能接近依赖源数据的方法，mAAP和mAP分别达到10.9和11.6，mAPQ提升+4.3。

Conclusion: UNLOCK为全景图像分割提供了一种更实用的解决方案，性能优越且开源。

Abstract: Panoramic image processing is essential for omni-context perception, yet
faces constraints like distortions, perspective occlusions, and limited
annotations. Previous unsupervised domain adaptation methods transfer knowledge
from labeled pinhole data to unlabeled panoramic images, but they require
access to source pinhole data. To address these, we introduce a more practical
task, i.e., Source-Free Occlusion-Aware Seamless Segmentation (SFOASS), and
propose its first solution, called UNconstrained Learning Omni-Context
Knowledge (UNLOCK). Specifically, UNLOCK includes two key modules: Omni
Pseudo-Labeling Learning and Amodal-Driven Context Learning. While adapting
without relying on source data or target labels, this framework enhances models
to achieve segmentation with 360{\deg} viewpoint coverage and occlusion-aware
reasoning. Furthermore, we benchmark the proposed SFOASS task through both
real-to-real and synthetic-to-real adaptation settings. Experimental results
show that our source-free method achieves performance comparable to
source-dependent methods, yielding state-of-the-art scores of 10.9 in mAAP and
11.6 in mAP, along with an absolute improvement of +4.3 in mAPQ over the
source-only method. All data and code will be made publicly available at

Abstract: Pathology image segmentation is crucial in computational pathology for
analyzing histological features relevant to cancer diagnosis and prognosis.
However, current methods face major challenges in clinical applications due to
limited annotated data and restricted category definitions. To address these
limitations, we propose PathSegmentor, the first text-prompted segmentation
foundation model designed specifically for pathology images. We also introduce
PathSeg , the largest and most comprehensive dataset for pathology
segmentation, built from 17 public sources and containing 275k image-mask-label
triples across 160 diverse categories. With PathSegmentor, users can perform
semantic segmentation using natural language prompts, eliminating the need for
laborious spatial inputs such as points or boxes. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PathSegmentor outperforms specialized models with higher
accuracy and broader applicability, while maintaining a compact architecture.
It significantly surpasses existing spatial- and text-prompted models by 0.145
and 0.429 in overall Dice scores, respectively, showing strong robustness in
segmenting complex structures and generalizing to external datasets. Moreover,
PathSegmentor's outputs enhance the interpretability of diagnostic models
through feature importance estimation and imaging biomarker discovery, offering
pathologists evidence-based support for clinical decision-making. This work
advances the development of explainable AI in precision oncology.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of 3D vision-language models (VLMs) has spurred
significant interest in interactive point cloud processing tasks, particularly
for real-world applications. However, existing methods often underperform in
point-level tasks, such as segmentation, due to missing direct 3D-text
alignment, limiting their ability to link local 3D features with textual
context. To solve this problem, we propose TSDASeg, a Two-Stage model coupled
with a Direct cross-modal Alignment module and memory module for interactive
point cloud Segmentation. We introduce the direct cross-modal alignment module
to establish explicit alignment between 3D point clouds and textual/2D image
data. Within the memory module, we employ multiple dedicated memory banks to
separately store text features, visual features, and their cross-modal
correspondence mappings. These memory banks are dynamically leveraged through
self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms to update scene-specific features
based on prior stored data, effectively addressing inconsistencies in
interactive segmentation results across diverse scenarios. Experiments
conducted on multiple 3D instruction, reference, and semantic segmentation
datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

Abstract: Novel view synthesis is a task of generating scenes from unseen perspectives;
however, synthesizing dynamic scenes from blurry monocular videos remains an
unresolved challenge that has yet to be effectively addressed. Existing novel
view synthesis methods are often constrained by their reliance on
high-resolution images or strong assumptions about static geometry and rigid
scene priors. Consequently, their approaches lack robustness in real-world
environments with dynamic object and camera motion, leading to instability and
degraded visual fidelity. To address this, we propose Motion-aware Dynamic View
Synthesis from Blurry Monocular Video via Sparse-Controlled Gaussian Splatting
(DBMovi-GS), a method designed for dynamic view synthesis from blurry monocular
videos. Our model generates dense 3D Gaussians, restoring sharpness from blurry
videos and reconstructing detailed 3D geometry of the scene affected by dynamic
motion variations. Our model achieves robust performance in novel view
synthesis under dynamic blurry scenes and sets a new benchmark in realistic
novel view synthesis for blurry monocular video inputs.

Abstract: Many existing methods for 3D cuboid annotation of vehicles rely on expensive
and carefully calibrated camera-LiDAR or stereo setups, limiting their
accessibility for large-scale data collection. We introduce ToosiCubix, a
simple yet powerful approach for annotating ground-truth cuboids using only
monocular images and intrinsic camera parameters. Our method requires only
about 10 user clicks per vehicle, making it highly practical for adding 3D
annotations to existing datasets originally collected without specialized
equipment. By annotating specific features (e.g., wheels, car badge,
symmetries) across different vehicle parts, we accurately estimate each
vehicle's position, orientation, and dimensions up to a scale ambiguity (8
DoF). The geometric constraints are formulated as an optimization problem,
which we solve using a coordinate descent strategy, alternating between
Perspective-n-Points (PnP) and least-squares subproblems. To handle common
ambiguities such as scale and unobserved dimensions, we incorporate
probabilistic size priors, enabling 9 DoF cuboid placements. We validate our
annotations against the KITTI and Cityscapes3D datasets, demonstrating that our
method offers a cost-effective and scalable solution for high-quality 3D cuboid
annotation.

Abstract: Challenges such as the lack of high-quality annotations, long-tailed data
distributions, and inconsistent staining styles pose significant obstacles to
training neural networks to detect abnormal cells in cytopathology robustly.
This paper proposes a style-aligned image composition (SAIC) method that
composes high-fidelity and style-preserved pathological images to enhance the
effectiveness and robustness of detection models. Without additional training,
SAIC first selects an appropriate candidate from the abnormal cell bank based
on attribute guidance. Then, it employs a high-frequency feature reconstruction
to achieve a style-aligned and high-fidelity composition of abnormal cells and
pathological backgrounds. Finally, it introduces a large vision-language model
to filter high-quality synthesis images. Experimental results demonstrate that
incorporating SAIC-synthesized images effectively enhances the performance and
robustness of abnormal cell detection for tail categories and styles, thereby
improving overall detection performance. The comprehensive quality evaluation
further confirms the generalizability and practicality of SAIC in clinical

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合光流损失和深度正则化的3D高斯泼溅SLAM方法，用于内窥镜场景下的高效3D重建和实时可视化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 内窥镜场景中存在非朗伯表面引起的光度不一致性和呼吸导致的动态运动，这些问题影响了SLAM系统的性能。

Method: 引入光流损失作为几何约束，并提出深度正则化策略以解决光度不一致问题，同时优化3DGS的细化策略。

Result: 在C3VD静态数据集和StereoMIS动态数据集上，该方法在视图合成和姿态估计方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在内窥镜静态和动态场景中均表现出高性能，代码将在论文接受后公开。

Abstract: Efficient three-dimensional reconstruction and real-time visualization are
critical in surgical scenarios such as endoscopy. In recent years, 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable performance in efficient 3D
reconstruction and rendering. Most 3DGS-based Simultaneous Localization and
Mapping (SLAM) methods only rely on the appearance constraints for optimizing
both 3DGS and camera poses. However, in endoscopic scenarios, the challenges
include photometric inconsistencies caused by non-Lambertian surfaces and
dynamic motion from breathing affects the performance of SLAM systems. To
address these issues, we additionally introduce optical flow loss as a
geometric constraint, which effectively constrains both the 3D structure of the
scene and the camera motion. Furthermore, we propose a depth regularisation
strategy to mitigate the problem of photometric inconsistencies and ensure the
validity of 3DGS depth rendering in endoscopic scenes. In addition, to improve
scene representation in the SLAM system, we improve the 3DGS refinement
strategy by focusing on viewpoints corresponding to Keyframes with suboptimal
rendering quality frames, achieving better rendering results. Extensive
experiments on the C3VD static dataset and the StereoMIS dynamic dataset
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in
novel view synthesis and pose estimation, exhibiting high performance in both
static and dynamic surgical scenes. The source code will be publicly available
upon paper acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种逆向场景文本去除（ISTR）方法，用于检测图像是否经过文本去除处理，并定位被去除的文本区域。实验表明该方法具有高准确性，可用于检测潜在的滥用行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着场景文本去除（STR）技术的发展，其滥用风险增加。研究逆向STR（ISTR）旨在检测和定位被去除的文本，以防止滥用并改进STR技术。

Method: ISTR通过分析STR处理后的图像，专注于二分类（检测图像是否经过STR处理）和定位被去除的文本区域。此外，还尝试训练文本识别器以恢复被去除的文本内容。

Result: 实验证明，ISTR在检测和定位任务中具有高准确性，能够有效识别潜在的滥用行为。

Conclusion: ISTR为STR技术的滥用提供了检测手段，同时为改进STR技术提供了新思路。

Abstract: Scene text removal (STR) aims to erase textual elements from images. It was
originally intended for removing privacy-sensitiveor undesired texts from
natural scene images, but is now also appliedto typographic images. STR
typically detects text regions and theninpaints them. Although STR has advanced
through neural networksand synthetic data, misuse risks have increased. This
paper investi-gates Inverse STR (ISTR), which analyzes STR-processed images
andfocuses on binary classification (detecting whether an image has un-dergone
STR) and localizing removed text regions. We demonstrate inexperiments that
these tasks are achievable with high accuracies, en-abling detection of
potential misuse and improving STR. We also at-tempt to recover the removed
text content by training a text recognizerto understand its difficulty.

TL;DR: VisionGuard是一个多阶段框架，通过自适应标签和上下文扩展模块提升头盔违规检测的准确性和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 头盔违规检测在环境多变、数据不一致的情况下面临挑战，需要更可靠的解决方案。

Method: 提出VisionGuard框架，包含自适应标签模块（基于跟踪的标签优化）和上下文扩展模块（生成虚拟边界框以解决数据不平衡）。

Result: 实验显示VisionGuard比基线检测器mAP提升3.1%，适用于交通监控系统。

Conclusion: VisionGuard有效提升头盔违规检测性能，具有实际部署潜力，促进道路安全和法规遵从。

Abstract: Enforcing helmet regulations among motorcyclists is essential for enhancing
road safety and ensuring the effectiveness of traffic management systems.
However, automatic detection of helmet violations faces significant challenges
due to environmental variability, camera angles, and inconsistencies in the
data. These factors hinder reliable detection of motorcycles and riders and
disrupt consistent object classification. To address these challenges, we
propose VisionGuard, a synergistic multi-stage framework designed to overcome
the limitations of frame-wise detectors, especially in scenarios with class
imbalance and inconsistent annotations. VisionGuard integrates two key
components: Adaptive Labeling and Contextual Expander modules. The Adaptive
Labeling module is a tracking-based refinement technique that enhances
classification consistency by leveraging a tracking algorithm to assign
persistent labels across frames and correct misclassifications. The Contextual
Expander module improves recall for underrepresented classes by generating
virtual bounding boxes with appropriate confidence scores, effectively
addressing the impact of data imbalance. Experimental results show that
VisionGuard improves overall mAP by 3.1% compared to baseline detectors,
demonstrating its effectiveness and potential for real-world deployment in
traffic surveillance systems, ultimately promoting safety and regulatory
compliance.

Motivation: 解决自动驾驶场景中相机和LiDAR数据的跨模态分割问题，同时避免人工标注的瓶颈。

Method: 提出UMPE对齐多模态特征，MCMA增强时序一致性，并开发多模态自动数据引擎生成伪标签。

Result: 在Waymo-4DSeg数据集上验证了SAM4D的跨模态分割能力和高效数据标注潜力。

Conclusion: SAM4D在跨模态分割和数据标注方面表现出色，为自动驾驶场景提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: We present SAM4D, a multi-modal and temporal foundation model designed for
promptable segmentation across camera and LiDAR streams. Unified Multi-modal
Positional Encoding (UMPE) is introduced to align camera and LiDAR features in
a shared 3D space, enabling seamless cross-modal prompting and interaction.
Additionally, we propose Motion-aware Cross-modal Memory Attention (MCMA),
which leverages ego-motion compensation to enhance temporal consistency and
long-horizon feature retrieval, ensuring robust segmentation across dynamically
changing autonomous driving scenes. To avoid annotation bottlenecks, we develop
a multi-modal automated data engine that synergizes VFM-driven video masklets,
spatiotemporal 4D reconstruction, and cross-modal masklet fusion. This
framework generates camera-LiDAR aligned pseudo-labels at a speed orders of
magnitude faster than human annotation while preserving VFM-derived semantic
fidelity in point cloud representations. We conduct extensive experiments on
the constructed Waymo-4DSeg, which demonstrate the powerful cross-modal
segmentation ability and great potential in data annotation of proposed SAM4D.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合Segment Anything Model（SAM）和Forward-Forward Contrastive Learning（FFCL）的深度学习框架，用于提高乳腺癌术中标本边缘评估的准确性和速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前使用的2D标本放射成像（SR）在评估术中标本边缘状态时准确性有限，导致近四分之一的患者需要额外手术。

Method: 通过标注SR图像中的恶性、非恶性组织和病理确认边缘区域，使用FFCL预训练ResNet-18进行分类，并利用SAM进行精细边缘分割。

Result: AUC为0.8455，Dice相似性比基线模型提高27.4%，推理时间缩短至47毫秒/图像。

Conclusion: FFCL-SAM显著提高了术中边缘评估的速度和准确性，有望减少再切除率并改善乳腺癌治疗效果。

Abstract: Complete removal of cancer tumors with a negative specimen margin during
lumpectomy is essential in reducing breast cancer recurrence. However, 2D
specimen radiography (SR), the current method used to assess intraoperative
specimen margin status, has limited accuracy, resulting in nearly a quarter of
patients requiring additional surgery. To address this, we propose a novel deep
learning framework combining the Segment Anything Model (SAM) with
Forward-Forward Contrastive Learning (FFCL), a pre-training strategy leveraging
both local and global contrastive learning for patch-level classification of SR
images. After annotating SR images with regions of known maligancy,
non-malignant tissue, and pathology-confirmed margins, we pre-train a ResNet-18
backbone with FFCL to classify margin status, then reconstruct coarse binary
masks to prompt SAM for refined tumor margin segmentation. Our approach
achieved an AUC of 0.8455 for margin classification and segmented margins with
a 27.4% improvement in Dice similarity over baseline models, while reducing
inference time to 47 milliseconds per image. These results demonstrate that
FFCL-SAM significantly enhances both the speed and accuracy of intraoperative
margin assessment, with strong potential to reduce re-excision rates and
improve surgical outcomes in breast cancer treatment. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Aging Multiverse框架，通过单张图像生成多种受外部因素影响的面部老化轨迹，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常将老化建模为单一确定性路径，无法反映多样化的未来，因此需要一种能生成多样化老化轨迹的方法。

Method: 提出一种无需训练的扩散方法，结合注意力混合和模拟老化正则化策略，平衡身份保留、年龄准确性和条件控制。

Result: 实验和用户研究表明，该方法在身份保留、老化真实性和条件对齐方面表现优异，优于现有模型。

Conclusion: Aging Multiverse将老化转化为多维度、可控且可解释的过程，为数字叙事、健康教育和个性化可视化开辟了新途径。

Abstract: We introduce the Aging Multiverse, a framework for generating multiple
plausible facial aging trajectories from a single image, each conditioned on
external factors such as environment, health, and lifestyle. Unlike prior
methods that model aging as a single deterministic path, our approach creates
an aging tree that visualizes diverse futures. To enable this, we propose a
training-free diffusion-based method that balances identity preservation, age
accuracy, and condition control. Our key contributions include attention mixing
to modulate editing strength and a Simulated Aging Regularization strategy to
stabilize edits. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance across identity preservation, aging realism, and
conditional alignment, outperforming existing editing and age-progression
models, which often fail to account for one or more of the editing criteria. By
transforming aging into a multi-dimensional, controllable, and interpretable
process, our approach opens up new creative and practical avenues in digital
storytelling, health education, and personalized visualization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AR方法需要用户通过3D标注对齐AR显示来采集数据，任务繁重且场景受限。

Method: 使用局部重建光场和可视化误差，引导用户插入新视角以减少误差。

Result: 误差峰值可视化方法侵入性低，减少用户失望，且需要更少视角样本。同时支持大场景的辐射场重建。

Conclusion: 该方法解放了用户对3D标注的依赖，扩展了场景探索范围，提升了新视角合成的效果。

Abstract: Augmented reality (AR) provides ways to visualize missing view samples for
novel view synthesis. Existing approaches present 3D annotations for new view
samples and task users with taking images by aligning the AR display. This data
collection task is known to be mentally demanding and limits capture areas to
pre-defined small areas due to the ideal but restrictive underlying sampling
theory. To free users from 3D annotations and limited scene exploration, we
propose using locally reconstructed light fields and visualizing errors to be
removed by inserting new views. Our results show that the error-peaking
visualization is less invasive, reduces disappointment in final results, and is
satisfactory with fewer view samples in our mobile view synthesis system. We
also show that our approach can contribute to recent radiance field
reconstruction for larger scenes, such as 3D Gaussian splatting.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于评分的指令生成（SIG）管道，用于视频质量评估（VQA），通过自动化生成指令数据（Score2Instruct数据集）和改进的调优策略，提升了视频大型多模态模型（LMMs）的质量评分和解释能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的VQA方法仅提供数值评分，无法全面描述视频质量的复杂维度，限制了其应用。利用语言输出的优势，通过指令调优将视频LMMs应用于VQA有望解决这一问题。

Method: 提出SIG管道，自动化生成视频质量指令数据（S2I数据集），并设计分层Chain-of-Thought（CoT）建模质量维度与整体质量的关系。采用渐进式调优策略提升模型能力。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在S2I-Bench和现有基准测试中显著提升了视频LMMs的质量评分和解释能力。

Conclusion: SIG管道和S2I数据集为视频LMMs的指令调优提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案，推动了VQA领域的发展。

Abstract: Classical video quality assessment (VQA) methods generate a numerical score
to judge a video's perceived visual fidelity and clarity. Yet, a score fails to
describe the video's complex quality dimensions, restricting its applicability.
Benefiting from the linguistic output, adapting video large multimodal models
(LMMs) to VQA via instruction tuning has the potential to address this issue.
The core of the approach lies in the video quality-centric instruction data.
Previous explorations mainly focus on the image domain, and their data
generation processes heavily rely on human quality annotations and proprietary
systems, limiting data scalability and effectiveness. To address these
challenges, we propose the Score-based Instruction Generation (SIG) pipeline.
Specifically, SIG first scores multiple quality dimensions of an unlabeled
video and maps scores to text-defined levels. It then explicitly incorporates a
hierarchical Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to model the correlation between specific
dimensions and overall quality, mimicking the human visual system's reasoning
process. The automated pipeline eliminates the reliance on expert-written
quality descriptions and proprietary systems, ensuring data scalability and
generation efficiency. To this end, the resulting Score2Instruct (S2I) dataset
contains over 320K diverse instruction-response pairs, laying the basis for
instruction tuning. Moreover, to advance video LMMs' quality scoring and
justification abilities simultaneously, we devise a progressive tuning strategy
to fully unleash the power of S2I. Built upon SIG, we further curate a
benchmark termed S2I-Bench with 400 open-ended questions to better evaluate the
quality justification capacity of video LMMs. Experimental results on the
S2I-Bench and existing benchmarks indicate that our method consistently
improves quality scoring and justification capabilities across multiple video
LMMs.

Result: 实验证明FedSC在多种挑战性场景下有效，关键组件显著提升效率。

Conclusion: FedSC通过语义级协作成功解决了数据异构性问题，并提供了理论收敛保证。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) aims to train models collaboratively across clients
without sharing data for privacy-preserving. However, one major challenge is
the data heterogeneity issue, which refers to the biased labeling preferences
at multiple clients. A number of existing FL methods attempt to tackle data
heterogeneity locally (e.g., regularizing local models) or globally (e.g.,
fine-tuning global model), often neglecting inherent semantic information
contained in each client. To explore the possibility of using intra-client
semantically meaningful knowledge in handling data heterogeneity, in this
paper, we propose Federated Learning with Semantic-Aware Collaboration (FedSC)
to capture client-specific and class-relevant knowledge across heterogeneous
clients. The core idea of FedSC is to construct relational prototypes and
consistent prototypes at semantic-level, aiming to provide fruitful class
underlying knowledge and stable convergence signals in a prototype-wise
collaborative way. On the one hand, FedSC introduces an inter-contrastive
learning strategy to bring instance-level embeddings closer to relational
prototypes with the same semantics and away from distinct classes. On the other
hand, FedSC devises consistent prototypes via a discrepancy aggregation manner,
as a regularization penalty to constrain the optimization region of the local
model. Moreover, a theoretical analysis for FedSC is provided to ensure a
convergence guarantee. Experimental results on various challenging scenarios
demonstrate the effectiveness of FedSC and the efficiency of crucial
components.

Conclusion: 量子图像生成在量子硬件进步后具有广阔前景，模型在真实IBM量子机器上表现出稳健性能。

Abstract: Machine learning-assisted diagnosis is gaining traction in skin disease
detection, but training effective models requires large amounts of high-quality
data. Skin disease datasets often suffer from class imbalance, privacy
concerns, and object bias, making data augmentation essential. While classical
generative models are widely used, they demand extensive computational
resources and lengthy training time. Quantum computing offers a promising
alternative, but existing quantum-based image generation methods can only yield
grayscale low-quality images. Through a novel classical-quantum latent space
fusion technique, our work overcomes this limitation and introduces the first
classical-quantum generative adversarial network (GAN) capable of generating
color medical images. Our model outperforms classical deep convolutional GANs
and existing hybrid classical-quantum GANs in both image generation quality and
classification performance boost when used as data augmentation. Moreover, the
performance boost is comparable with that achieved using state-of-the-art
classical generative models, yet with over 25 times fewer parameters and 10
times fewer training epochs. Such results suggest a promising future for
quantum image generation as quantum hardware advances. Finally, we demonstrate
the robust performance of our model on real IBM quantum machine with hardware
noise.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在面部表情识别中难以捕捉细粒度文本-视觉关系，导致对细微表情差异的区分能力不足。

Method: 结合多粒度硬提示生成策略（利用ChatGPT生成详细描述）和原型引导的视觉特征对齐，同时引入跨模态全局-局部对齐模块。

Result: 在三个FER基准数据集上表现优于现有方法，同时保持预训练模型的泛化能力并降低计算成本。

Conclusion: MPA-FER框架有效提升了面部表情识别的精度和可解释性，同时兼顾效率和性能。

Abstract: Prompt learning has been widely adopted to efficiently adapt vision-language
models (VLMs) like CLIP for various downstream tasks. Despite their success,
current VLM-based facial expression recognition (FER) methods struggle to
capture fine-grained textual-visual relationships, which are essential for
distinguishing subtle differences between facial expressions. To address this
challenge, we propose a multimodal prompt alignment framework for FER, called
MPA-FER, that provides fine-grained semantic guidance to the learning process
of prompted visual features, resulting in more precise and interpretable
representations. Specifically, we introduce a multi-granularity hard prompt
generation strategy that utilizes a large language model (LLM) like ChatGPT to
generate detailed descriptions for each facial expression. The LLM-based
external knowledge is injected into the soft prompts by minimizing the feature
discrepancy between the soft prompts and the hard prompts. To preserve the
generalization abilities of the pretrained CLIP model, our approach
incorporates prototype-guided visual feature alignment, ensuring that the
prompted visual features from the frozen image encoder align closely with
class-specific prototypes. Additionally, we propose a cross-modal global-local
alignment module that focuses on expression-relevant facial features, further
improving the alignment between textual and visual features. Extensive
experiments demonstrate our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on
three FER benchmark datasets, while retaining the benefits of the pretrained
model and minimizing computational costs.

Abstract: Effective deep feature extraction via feature-level fusion is crucial for
multimodal object detection. However, previous studies often involve complex
training processes that integrate modality-specific features by stacking
multiple feature-level fusion units, leading to significant computational
overhead. To address this issue, we propose a new fusion detection baseline
that uses a single feature-level fusion unit to enable high-performance
detection, thereby simplifying the training process. Based on this approach, we
propose a lightweight attention-guided self-modulation feature fusion network
(LASFNet), which introduces a novel attention-guided self-modulation feature
fusion (ASFF) module that adaptively adjusts the responses of fusion features
at both global and local levels based on attention information from different
modalities, thereby promoting comprehensive and enriched feature generation.
Additionally, a lightweight feature attention transformation module (FATM) is
designed at the neck of LASFNet to enhance the focus on fused features and
minimize information loss. Extensive experiments on three representative
datasets demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art methods, our approach
achieves a favorable efficiency-accuracy trade-off, reducing the number of
parameters and computational cost by as much as 90% and 85%, respectively,
while improving detection accuracy (mAP) by 1%-3%. The code will be

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像tokenization方法计算量大，且需要2D网格结构。本文旨在通过1D二进制潜在空间进一步压缩离散图像表示，提高效率。

Method: 采用1D二进制向量序列表示图像，替代传统one-hot编码，结合简单模型架构。

Conclusion: 1D二进制潜在空间为图像生成提供了高效、可扩展的替代方案，无需私有数据或后训练优化即可达到现代模型的性能。

Abstract: Image tokenization plays a critical role in reducing the computational
demands of modeling high-resolution images, significantly improving the
efficiency of image and multimodal understanding and generation. Recent
advances in 1D latent spaces have reduced the number of tokens required by
eliminating the need for a 2D grid structure. In this paper, we further advance
compact discrete image representation by introducing 1D binary image latents.
By representing each image as a sequence of binary vectors, rather than using
traditional one-hot codebook tokens, our approach preserves high-resolution
details while maintaining the compactness of 1D latents. To the best of our
knowledge, our text-to-image models are the first to achieve competitive
performance in both diffusion and auto-regressive generation using just 128
discrete tokens for images up to 1024x1024, demonstrating up to a 32-fold
reduction in token numbers compared to standard VQ-VAEs. The proposed 1D binary
latent space, coupled with simple model architectures, achieves marked
improvements in speed training and inference speed. Our text-to-image models
allow for a global batch size of 4096 on a single GPU node with 8 AMD MI300X
GPUs, and the training can be completed within 200 GPU days. Our models achieve
competitive performance compared to modern image generation models without any
in-house private training data or post-training refinements, offering a
scalable and efficient alternative to conventional tokenization methods.

Motivation: 商业RGB-D相机对非朗伯物体生成的深度图常存在噪声和不完整问题，传统方法因训练数据有限而泛化能力差。扩散模型的视觉先验虽有助于提升任务性能，但训练-推理偏差和非朗伯区域特征不足限制了效果。

Method: 提出DidSee框架：1）采用零终端信噪比的重缩放噪声调度器消除信号泄漏偏差；2）设计噪声无关的单步训练策略减少误差累积；3）引入语义增强器联合深度补全与语义分割。

Conclusion: DidSee通过改进扩散框架和引入语义增强，显著提升了非朗伯物体的深度补全性能，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Commercial RGB-D cameras often produce noisy, incomplete depth maps for
non-Lambertian objects. Traditional depth completion methods struggle to
generalize due to the limited diversity and scale of training data. Recent
advances exploit visual priors from pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models
to enhance generalization in dense prediction tasks. However, we find that
biases arising from training-inference mismatches in the vanilla diffusion
framework significantly impair depth completion performance. Additionally, the
lack of distinct visual features in non-Lambertian regions further hinders
precise prediction. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{DidSee}, a
diffusion-based framework for depth completion on non-Lambertian objects.
First, we integrate a rescaled noise scheduler enforcing a zero terminal
signal-to-noise ratio to eliminate signal leakage bias. Second, we devise a
noise-agnostic single-step training formulation to alleviate error accumulation
caused by exposure bias and optimize the model with a task-specific loss.
Finally, we incorporate a semantic enhancer that enables joint depth completion
and semantic segmentation, distinguishing objects from backgrounds and yielding
precise, fine-grained depth maps. DidSee achieves state-of-the-art performance
on multiple benchmarks, demonstrates robust real-world generalization, and
effectively improves downstream tasks such as category-level pose estimation

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决检测器因训练与测试数据域差异导致的性能下降问题，同时降低扩散模型的高推理成本并充分利用其能力。

Method: 提取单步扩散过程的中间特征，构建对象中心辅助分支，应用一致性损失，并在统一框架下进行特征和目标对齐。

Result: 在3个DA基准和5个DG基准上取得竞争性结果，在COCO泛化基准上表现优异，尤其在大域偏移和低数据场景中效率显著。

Conclusion: 扩散模型在域泛化和自适应检测任务中具有优势，为跨域视觉感知任务提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Detectors often suffer from performance drop due to domain gap between
training and testing data. Recent methods explore diffusion models applied to
domain generalization (DG) and adaptation (DA) tasks, but still struggle with
large inference costs and have not yet fully leveraged the capabilities of
diffusion models. We propose to tackle these problems by extracting
intermediate features from a single-step diffusion process, improving feature
collection and fusion to reduce inference time by 75% while enhancing
performance on source domains (i.e., Fitness). Then, we construct an
object-centered auxiliary branch by applying box-masked images with class
prompts to extract robust and domain-invariant features that focus on object.
We also apply consistency loss to align the auxiliary and ordinary branch,
balancing fitness and generalization while preventing overfitting and improving
performance on target domains (i.e., Generalization). Furthermore, within a
unified framework, standard detectors are guided by diffusion detectors through
feature-level and object-level alignment on source domains (for DG) and
unlabeled target domains (for DA), thereby improving cross-domain detection
performance (i.e., Transferability). Our method achieves competitive results on
3 DA benchmarks and 5 DG benchmarks. Additionally, experiments on COCO
generalization benchmark demonstrate that our method maintains significant
advantages and show remarkable efficiency in large domain shifts and low-data
scenarios. Our work shows the superiority of applying diffusion models to
domain generalized and adaptive detection tasks and offers valuable insights
for visual perception tasks across diverse domains. The code is available at

*Hansam Cho,Seoung Bum Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为FGS的方法，通过忠实度引导和调度策略，在保持图像编辑能力的同时提升忠实度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本引导扩散模型中编辑能力与忠实度之间的固有权衡问题。

Method: 结合忠实度引导以增强输入图像信息的保留，并引入调度策略解决编辑能力与忠实度的不对齐。

Result: 实验表明FGS在保持编辑能力的同时显著提升了忠实度，且兼容多种编辑方法。

Conclusion: FGS是一种高效的方法，能够实现高质量且精确的图像编辑。

Abstract: Text-guided diffusion models have become essential for high-quality image
synthesis, enabling dynamic image editing. In image editing, two crucial
aspects are editability, which determines the extent of modification, and
faithfulness, which reflects how well unaltered elements are preserved.
However, achieving optimal results is challenging because of the inherent
trade-off between editability and faithfulness. To address this, we propose
Faithfulness Guidance and Scheduling (FGS), which enhances faithfulness with
minimal impact on editability. FGS incorporates faithfulness guidance to
strengthen the preservation of input image information and introduces a
scheduling strategy to resolve misalignment between editability and
faithfulness. Experimental results demonstrate that FGS achieves superior
faithfulness while maintaining editability. Moreover, its compatibility with
various editing methods enables precise, high-quality image edits across
diverse tasks.

Motivation: 现有对抗攻击方法主要依赖监督学习的中间特征，而自监督学习与ViT的结合可能提供更好的特征表示，从而提升对抗样本的泛化能力。

Method: 设计了dSVA方法，利用自监督ViT的全局结构特征（CL）和局部纹理特征（MIM），通过生成器框架和注意力机制联合训练生成对抗样本。

Result: 实验表明，CL和MIM特征的结合使ViT关注不同特征倾向，显著提升了对抗样本的黑盒迁移能力，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 自监督ViT的双特征攻击方法dSVA在对抗样本生成中表现出卓越的泛化能力，为黑盒攻击提供了新思路。

Abstract: The ability of deep neural networks (DNNs) come from extracting and
interpreting features from the data provided. By exploiting intermediate
features in DNNs instead of relying on hard labels, we craft adversarial
perturbation that generalize more effectively, boosting black-box
transferability. These features ubiquitously come from supervised learning in
previous work. Inspired by the exceptional synergy between self-supervised
learning and the Transformer architecture, this paper explores whether
exploiting self-supervised Vision Transformer (ViT) representations can improve
adversarial transferability. We present dSVA -- a generative dual
self-supervised ViT features attack, that exploits both global structural
features from contrastive learning (CL) and local textural features from masked
image modeling (MIM), the self-supervised learning paradigm duo for ViTs. We
design a novel generative training framework that incorporates a generator to
create black-box adversarial examples, and strategies to train the generator by
exploiting joint features and the attention mechanism of self-supervised ViTs.
Our findings show that CL and MIM enable ViTs to attend to distinct feature
tendencies, which, when exploited in tandem, boast great adversarial
generalizability. By disrupting dual deep features distilled by self-supervised
ViTs, we are rewarded with remarkable black-box transferability to models of
various architectures that outperform state-of-the-arts. Code available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Result: 实验证明RoI-Matcher在RoI-Matching-Bench上有效，可作为进一步研究的基线。

Conclusion: RoI-Matching任务和RoI-Matcher框架为文档分析提供了灵活高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Document understanding and analysis have received a lot of attention due to
their widespread application. However, existing document analysis solutions,
such as document layout analysis and key information extraction, are only
suitable for fixed category definitions and granularities, and cannot achieve
flexible applications customized by users. Therefore, this paper defines a new
task named ``Class-Agnostic Region-of-Interest Matching'' (``RoI-Matching'' for
short), which aims to match the customized regions in a flexible, efficient,
multi-granularity, and open-set manner. The visual prompt of the reference
document and target document images are fed into our model, while the output is
the corresponding bounding boxes in the target document images. To meet the
above requirements, we construct a benchmark RoI-Matching-Bench, which sets
three levels of difficulties following real-world conditions, and propose the
macro and micro metrics to evaluate. Furthermore, we also propose a new
framework RoI-Matcher, which employs a siamese network to extract multi-level
features both in the reference and target domains, and cross-attention layers
to integrate and align similar semantics in different domains. Experiments show
that our method with a simple procedure is effective on RoI-Matching-Bench, and
serves as the baseline for further research. The code is available at

TL;DR: SAMURAI结合CLIP语义匹配和形状引导重排序，通过预处理提升掩码质量，在ROOMELSA挑战中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决仅用掩码2D图像和自然语言描述在复杂室内环境中检索3D对象的挑战。

Method: 整合CLIP语义匹配、形状引导重排序和多数投票策略，预处理优化掩码质量。

Result: 在ROOMELSA测试集上表现优异。

Conclusion: 形状先验与语言理解结合对开放世界3D对象检索至关重要。

Abstract: Retrieving 3D objects in complex indoor environments using only a masked 2D
image and a natural language description presents significant challenges. The
ROOMELSA challenge limits access to full 3D scene context, complicating
reasoning about object appearance, geometry, and semantics. These challenges
are intensified by distorted viewpoints, textureless masked regions, ambiguous
language prompts, and noisy segmentation masks. To address this, we propose
SAMURAI: Shape-Aware Multimodal Retrieval for 3D Object Identification. SAMURAI
integrates CLIP-based semantic matching with shape-guided re-ranking derived
from binary silhouettes of masked regions, alongside a robust majority voting
strategy. A dedicated preprocessing pipeline enhances mask quality by
extracting the largest connected component and removing background noise. Our
hybrid retrieval framework leverages both language and shape cues, achieving
competitive performance on the ROOMELSA private test set. These results
highlight the importance of combining shape priors with language understanding
for robust open-world 3D object retrieval.

Result: 实验表明，PoseMaster在A姿态角色生成上优于现有技术，并能精确控制任意姿态。

Conclusion: PoseMaster通过统一框架和优化条件控制，显著提升了3D角色生成的效率和质量。

Abstract: 3D characters play a crucial role in our daily entertainment. To improve the
efficiency of 3D character modeling, recent image-based methods use two
separate models to achieve pose standardization and 3D reconstruction of the
A-pose character. However, these methods are prone to generating distorted and
degraded images in the pose standardization stage due to self-occlusion and
viewpoints, which further affects the geometric quality of the subsequent
reconstruction process. To tackle these problems, we propose PoseMaster, an
end-to-end controllable 3D character generation framework. Specifically, we
unify pose transformation and 3D character generation into a flow-based 3D
native generation framework. To achieve accurate arbitrary-pose control, we
propose to leverage the 3D body bones existing in the skeleton of an animatable
character as the pose condition. Furthermore, considering the specificity of
multi-condition control, we randomly empty the pose condition and the image
condition during training to improve the effectiveness and generalizability of
pose control. Finally, we create a high-quality pose-control dataset derived
from realistic character animation data to make the model learning the implicit
relationships between skeleton and skinning weights. Extensive experiments show
that PoseMaster outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques in both
qualitative and quantitative evaluations for A-pose character generation while
demonstrating its powerful ability to achieve precise control for arbitrary
poses.

Abstract: With the rapid evolution of multimodal large language models, the capacity to
deeply understand and interpret human intentions has emerged as a critical
capability, which demands detailed and thoughtful reasoning. In recent studies,
Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated potential in enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Nonetheless, the
challenges associated with adapting RL to multimodal data and formats remain
largely unaddressed. In this paper, we identify two issues in existing
multimodal reasoning models: insufficient global context understanding and
shortcut problems. Insufficient context understanding can happen when a model
misinterprets multimodal context, resulting in incorrect answers. The shortcut
problem occurs when the model overlooks crucial clues in multimodal inputs,
directly addressing the query without considering the multimodal information.
To tackle these issues, we emphasize the necessity for the model to reason with
a clear understanding of the global context within multimodal inputs. This
global context understanding can effectively prevent the model from overlooking
key multimodal cues and ensure a thorough reasoning process. To ensure the
accurate interpretation of multimodal context information, we implement a
context reward judged by a large language model, alongside format and accuracy
rewards. Additionally, to improve complex reasoning capability, we employ the
LLM to assess the logical reward, determining whether the reasoning process
successfully integrates multimodal information with logical methods. We also
introduce a reasoning omni-modal benchmark, IntentBench, aimed at evaluating
models in understanding complex human intentions and emotions. Our proposed
method demonstrates advanced performance across multiple omni-modal benchmarks
compared to other open-source omni-modal models.

Abstract: Modern perception models, particularly those designed for multisensory
egocentric tasks, have achieved remarkable performance but often come with
substantial computational costs. These high demands pose challenges for
real-world deployment, especially in resource-constrained environments. In this
paper, we introduce EgoAdapt, a framework that adaptively performs cross-modal

speaker localization, and behavior anticipation. Our proposed policy module is
adaptable to task-specific action spaces, making it broadly applicable.

EasyCom, and Aria Everyday Activities demonstrate that our method significantly
enhances efficiency, reducing GMACs by up to 89.09%, parameters up to 82.02%,
and energy up to 9.6x, while still on-par and in many cases outperforming, the
performance of corresponding state-of-the-art models.

Motivation: 立体匹配在自动驾驶系统中至关重要，但现有深度学习模型难以同时实现高精度和实时性能。小规模成本体积虽能提升速度，但信息不足；大规模成本体积则计算复杂，难以实时。

Conclusion: ESM有效解决了小规模成本体积的信息丢失问题，实现了高精度和实时性能的平衡，为实时立体匹配提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Stereo matching has become an increasingly important component of modern
autonomous systems. Developing deep learning-based stereo matching models that
deliver high accuracy while operating in real-time continues to be a major
challenge in computer vision. In the domain of cost-volume-based stereo
matching, accurate disparity estimation depends heavily on large-scale cost
volumes. However, such large volumes store substantial redundant information
and also require computationally intensive aggregation units for processing and
regression, making real-time performance unattainable. Conversely, small-scale
cost volumes followed by lightweight aggregation units provide a promising
route for real-time performance, but lack sufficient information to ensure
highly accurate disparity estimation. To address this challenge, we propose the
Enhanced Shuffle Mixer (ESM) to mitigate information loss associated with
small-scale cost volumes. ESM restores critical details by integrating primary
features into the disparity upsampling unit. It quickly extracts features from
the initial disparity estimation and fuses them with image features. These
features are mixed by shuffling and layer splitting then refined through a
compact feature-guided hourglass network to recover more detailed scene
geometry. The ESM focuses on local contextual connectivity with a large
receptive field and low computational cost, leading to the reconstruction of a
highly accurate disparity map at real-time. The compact version of ESMStereo
achieves an inference speed of 116 FPS on high-end GPUs and 91 FPS on the AGX
Orin.

Conclusion: OracleFusion为解读甲骨文提供了专家级的见解，是推动甲骨文解读的有价值工具。

Abstract: As one of the earliest ancient languages, Oracle Bone Script (OBS)
encapsulates the cultural records and intellectual expressions of ancient
civilizations. Despite the discovery of approximately 4,500 OBS characters,
only about 1,600 have been deciphered. The remaining undeciphered ones, with
their complex structure and abstract imagery, pose significant challenges for
interpretation. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel
two-stage semantic typography framework, named OracleFusion. In the first
stage, this approach leverages the Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) with
enhanced Spatial Awareness Reasoning (SAR) to analyze the glyph structure of
the OBS character and perform visual localization of key components. In the
second stage, we introduce Oracle Structural Vector Fusion (OSVF),
incorporating glyph structure constraints and glyph maintenance constraints to
ensure the accurate generation of semantically enriched vector fonts. This
approach preserves the objective integrity of the glyph structure, offering
visually enhanced representations that assist experts in deciphering OBS.
Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that
OracleFusion outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models in terms of
semantics, visual appeal, and glyph maintenance, significantly enhancing both
readability and aesthetic quality. Furthermore, OracleFusion provides
expert-like insights on unseen oracle characters, making it a valuable tool for
advancing the decipherment of OBS.

Motivation: 现代深度学习模型在变化检测中计算复杂且资源消耗大，但精度提升有限。本研究旨在开发高效轻量模型，适合卫星端处理。

Method: 提出FlickCD模型，包含增强差异模块（EDM）抑制无关变化，以及局部-全局融合块（SWSA和EGSA）捕捉多尺度语义信息。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上，FlickCD显著减少计算和存储开销，同时达到或接近最优性能（F1分数损失<1%）。

Conclusion: FlickCD在性能和资源消耗之间取得了良好平衡，适用于资源受限的卫星端处理。

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection is essential for monitoring urban expansion,
disaster assessment, and resource management, offering timely, accurate, and
large-scale insights into dynamic landscape transformations. While deep
learning has revolutionized change detection, the increasing complexity and
computational demands of modern models have not necessarily translated into
significant accuracy gains. Instead of following this trend, this study
explores a more efficient approach, focusing on lightweight models that
maintain high accuracy while minimizing resource consumption, which is an
essential requirement for on-satellite processing. To this end, we propose
FlickCD, which means quick flick then get great results, pushing the boundaries
of the performance-resource trade-off. FlickCD introduces an Enhanced
Difference Module (EDM) to amplify critical feature differences between
temporal phases while suppressing irrelevant variations such as lighting and
weather changes, thereby reducing computational costs in the subsequent change
decoder. Additionally, the FlickCD decoder incorporates Local-Global Fusion
Blocks, leveraging Shifted Window Self-Attention (SWSA) and Enhanced Global
Self-Attention (EGSA) to efficiently capture semantic information at multiple
scales, preserving both coarse- and fine-grained changes. Extensive experiments
on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that FlickCD reduces computational and
storage overheads by more than an order of magnitude while achieving
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance or incurring only a minor (<1\% F1)
accuracy trade-off. The implementation code is publicly available at

Result: 实验表明，数据集和模型显著提升了多场景视频理解能力，并在多个视频基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: MultiClip-Bench和IPFormer-VideoLLM有效解决了VideoLLMs在多镜头场景中的挑战，并展现了广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
understanding capabilities, but are found struggling to tackle multi-shot
scenarios,e.g., video clips with varying camera angles or scene changes. This
challenge can render failures such as instance identity forgetting and key
frame negligence. In this work, we first attribute the challenge to the lack of
multi-shot annotations among existing datasets and therefore we introduce a new
dataset termed MultiClip-Bench, featuring dense descriptions and
instruction-based question-answering pairs tailored for multi-shot scenarios.
We empirically find that the training set significantly boosts the multi-shot
performance, while the testing benchmark provides a reliable measure of the
model capability in multi-shot scenarios. By further analyzing and discovering
that current models only encode instance features in a discrete or lossy
manner, at the risk of missing identity information, we then contribute a new
model IPFormer-VideoLLM. Its key idea is the injection of instance-level
features as instance prompts through an efficient attention-based connector.
This allows for the aggregation of instance-specific information across scenes.
Experiments demonstrate that our proposed dataset and model not only enhance
the multi-scene video understanding significantly, but also offer distinct
advantages across various video benchmarks.

Abstract: In dynamic 3D environments, accurately updating scene representations over
time is crucial for applications in robotics, mixed reality, and embodied AI.
As scenes evolve, efficient methods to incorporate changes are needed to
maintain up-to-date, high-quality reconstructions without the computational
overhead of re-optimizing the entire scene. This paper introduces CL-Splats,
which incrementally updates Gaussian splatting-based 3D representations from
sparse scene captures. CL-Splats integrates a robust change-detection module
that segments updated and static components within the scene, enabling focused,
local optimization that avoids unnecessary re-computation. Moreover, CL-Splats
supports storing and recovering previous scene states, facilitating temporal
segmentation and new scene-analysis applications. Our extensive experiments
demonstrate that CL-Splats achieves efficient updates with improved
reconstruction quality over the state-of-the-art. This establishes a robust
foundation for future real-time adaptation in 3D scene reconstruction tasks.

paired-to-paired data synthesis pipeline capable of generating well-calibrated
extremely low-light RAW images at three precise illuminance ranges of 0.01-0.1
lux, 0.001-0.01 lux, and 0.0001-0.001 lux, together with high-quality sRGB
references to comprise a large-scale paired dataset named
See-in-the-Extremely-Dark (SIED) to benchmark low-light RAW image enhancement
approaches. Furthermore, we propose a diffusion-based framework that leverages
the generative ability and intrinsic denoising property of diffusion models to
restore visually pleasing results from extremely low-SNR RAW inputs, in which
an Adaptive Illumination Correction Module (AICM) and a color consistency loss
are introduced to ensure accurate exposure correction and color restoration.
Extensive experiments on the proposed SIED and publicly available benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The code and dataset are available

*Xinzhuo Li,Adheesh Juvekar,Xingyou Liu,Muntasir Wahed,Kiet A. Nguyen,Ismini Lourentzou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HalluSegBench是一个新基准，用于通过反事实视觉推理评估视觉语言分割中的幻觉问题，揭示了视觉驱动幻觉比标签驱动更普遍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分割幻觉评估协议主要关注标签或文本幻觉，缺乏对视觉上下文的操控，无法诊断关键失败。

Method: 提出HalluSegBench，包含1340个反事实实例对和新的量化指标，评估视觉连贯场景编辑下的幻觉敏感性。

Result: 实验显示视觉驱动幻觉比标签驱动更普遍，模型常持续错误分割，需反事实推理诊断。

Conclusion: 反事实推理对评估视觉语言分割模型的接地性至关重要。

Abstract: Recent progress in vision-language segmentation has significantly advanced
grounded visual understanding. However, these models often exhibit
hallucinations by producing segmentation masks for objects not grounded in the
image content or by incorrectly labeling irrelevant regions. Existing
evaluation protocols for segmentation hallucination primarily focus on label or
textual hallucinations without manipulating the visual context, limiting their
capacity to diagnose critical failures. In response, we introduce
HalluSegBench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate
hallucinations in visual grounding through the lens of counterfactual visual
reasoning. Our benchmark consists of a novel dataset of 1340 counterfactual
instance pairs spanning 281 unique object classes, and a set of newly
introduced metrics that quantify hallucination sensitivity under visually
coherent scene edits. Experiments on HalluSegBench with state-of-the-art
vision-language segmentation models reveal that vision-driven hallucinations
are significantly more prevalent than label-driven ones, with models often
persisting in false segmentation, highlighting the need for counterfactual
reasoning to diagnose grounding fidelity.

*Jiawei Hu*

TL;DR: YOLO-FDA是一种基于YOLO的检测框架，通过细粒度细节增强和注意力引导特征融合，提升了工业表面缺陷检测的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业表面缺陷检测因缺陷类型多样、形状不规则、细粒度要求高和材质纹理复杂而具有挑战性。现有AI检测方法存在特征冗余、细节敏感度不足和多尺度鲁棒性差的问题。

Method: YOLO-FDA采用BiFPN架构增强多级特征聚合，引入DDFM模块捕捉细粒度结构变化，并提出AC和CAF两种注意力融合策略优化上下文表示。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，YOLO-FDA在准确性和鲁棒性上均优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: YOLO-FDA通过创新架构和策略，显著提升了工业表面缺陷检测的性能。

Abstract: Surface defect detection in industrial scenarios is both crucial and
technically demanding due to the wide variability in defect types, irregular
shapes and sizes, fine-grained requirements, and complex material textures.
Although recent advances in AI-based detectors have improved performance,
existing methods often suffer from redundant features, limited detail
sensitivity, and weak robustness under multiscale conditions. To address these
challenges, we propose YOLO-FDA, a novel YOLO-based detection framework that
integrates fine-grained detail enhancement and attention-guided feature fusion.
Specifically, we adopt a BiFPN-style architecture to strengthen bidirectional
multilevel feature aggregation within the YOLOv5 backbone. To better capture
fine structural changes, we introduce a Detail-directional Fusion Module (DDFM)
that introduces a directional asymmetric convolution in the second-lowest layer
to enrich spatial details and fuses the second-lowest layer with low-level
features to enhance semantic consistency. Furthermore, we propose two novel
attention-based fusion strategies, Attention-weighted Concatenation (AC) and
Cross-layer Attention Fusion (CAF) to improve contextual representation and
reduce feature noise. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate
that YOLO-FDA consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in
terms of both accuracy and robustness across diverse types of defects and
scales.

TL;DR: 该论文提出两种基于树结构的语义损失函数，利用标签层次结构优化高光谱图像（HSI）分割任务，并在稀疏标注数据上实现先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱成像（HSI）在手术应用中潜力巨大，但现有学习方法未能利用标签空间的语义层次结构，导致分割效果受限。

Method: 引入两种树状语义损失函数，结合稀疏标注训练方法，优化标签层次结构的分割任务。

Result: 在包含107个类别的稀疏标注HSI数据集上达到先进性能，同时有效检测异常分布像素。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提升了分割性能，还能在不影响正常分布像素分割的情况下检测异常像素。

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) shows great promise for surgical applications,
offering detailed insights into biological tissue differences beyond what the
naked eye can perceive. Refined labelling efforts are underway to train vision
systems to distinguish large numbers of subtly varying classes. However,
commonly used learning methods for biomedical segmentation tasks penalise all
errors equivalently and thus fail to exploit any inter-class semantics in the
label space. In this work, we introduce two tree-based semantic loss functions
which take advantage of a hierarchical organisation of the labels. We further
incorporate our losses in a recently proposed approach for training with
sparse, background-free annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
proposed method reaches state-of-the-art performance on a sparsely annotated
HSI dataset comprising $107$ classes organised in a clinically-defined semantic
tree structure. Furthermore, our method enables effective detection of
out-of-distribution (OOD) pixels without compromising segmentation performance
on in-distribution (ID) pixels.

Motivation: 心肌瘢痕的精确分割对临床评估和治疗规划至关重要，但现有方法面临标签噪声、数据异质性和类别不平衡的挑战。

Result: 在急性和慢性病例中表现优异，生成的分割结果准确且平滑，泛化能力强。

Conclusion: 该方法为自动化心肌瘢痕量化提供了可靠基础，支持深度学习在心脏影像中的广泛应用。

Abstract: The accurate segmentation of myocardial scars from cardiac MRI is essential
for clinical assessment and treatment planning. In this study, we propose a
robust deep-learning pipeline for fully automated myocardial scar detection and
segmentation by fine-tuning state-of-the-art models. The method explicitly
addresses challenges of label noise from semi-automatic annotations, data
heterogeneity, and class imbalance through the use of Kullback-Leibler loss and
extensive data augmentation. We evaluate the model's performance on both acute
and chronic cases and demonstrate its ability to produce accurate and smooth
segmentations despite noisy labels. In particular, our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art models like nnU-Net and shows strong generalizability in an
out-of-distribution test set, highlighting its robustness across various
imaging conditions and clinical tasks. These results establish a reliable
foundation for automated myocardial scar quantification and support the broader
clinical adoption of deep learning in cardiac imaging.

TL;DR: 提出一种新方法，通过整合几何和感知先验，无需额外训练即可从单张图像重建高质量3D物体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多视角一致性和几何细节上表现不佳，需要改进。

Method: 训练三个高斯分支（几何先验、感知先验和高斯噪声），通过交互和重投影策略优化。

Result: 实验显示该方法在3D重建和新视角合成上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能生成更一致且细节丰富的3D物体。

Abstract: Generating realistic 3D objects from single-view images requires natural
appearance, 3D consistency, and the ability to capture multiple plausible
interpretations of unseen regions. Existing approaches often rely on
fine-tuning pretrained 2D diffusion models or directly generating 3D
information through fast network inference or 3D Gaussian Splatting, but their
results generally suffer from poor multiview consistency and lack geometric
detail. To takle these issues, we present a novel method that seamlessly
integrates geometry and perception priors without requiring additional model
training to reconstruct detailed 3D objects from a single image. Specifically,
we train three different Gaussian branches initialized from the geometry prior,
perception prior and Gaussian noise, respectively. The geometry prior captures
the rough 3D shapes, while the perception prior utilizes the 2D pretrained
diffusion model to enhance multiview information. Subsequently, we refine 3D
Gaussian branches through mutual interaction between geometry and perception
priors, further enhanced by a reprojection-based strategy that enforces depth
consistency. Experiments demonstrate the higher-fidelity reconstruction results
of our method, outperforming existing methods on novel view synthesis and 3D
reconstruction, demonstrating robust and consistent 3D object generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D点云数据的几何变化导致Sim2Real域差距，现有无监督域适应方法因缺乏鲁棒的域不敏感描述符而表现不佳。

Method: 结合全局空间拓扑和局部几何特征的拓扑关系，提出自监督学习任务，并采用跨域对比学习和自训练策略。

Result: 在三个公开Sim2Real基准测试中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TAM框架有效缓解了Sim2Real域差距，提升了点云分类器的泛化能力。

Abstract: Learning semantic representations from point sets of 3D object shapes is
often challenged by significant geometric variations, primarily due to
differences in data acquisition methods. Typically, training data is generated
using point simulators, while testing data is collected with distinct 3D
sensors, leading to a simulation-to-reality (Sim2Real) domain gap that limits
the generalization ability of point classifiers. Current unsupervised domain
adaptation (UDA) techniques struggle with this gap, as they often lack robust,
domain-insensitive descriptors capable of capturing global topological
information, resulting in overfitting to the limited semantic patterns of the
source domain. To address this issue, we introduce a novel Topology-Aware
Modeling (TAM) framework for Sim2Real UDA on object point clouds. Our approach
mitigates the domain gap by leveraging global spatial topology, characterized
by low-level, high-frequency 3D structures, and by modeling the topological
relations of local geometric features through a novel self-supervised learning
task. Additionally, we propose an advanced self-training strategy that combines
cross-domain contrastive learning with self-training, effectively reducing the
impact of noisy pseudo-labels and enhancing the robustness of the adaptation
process. Experimental results on three public Sim2Real benchmarks validate the
effectiveness of our TAM framework, showing consistent improvements over
state-of-the-art methods across all evaluated tasks. The source code of this
work will be available at https://github.com/zou-longkun/TAG.git.

TL;DR: Video-X^2L通过双层KV压缩和选择性KV重加载，高效解决长视频理解的计算成本问题，无需额外训练且兼容现有MLLMs。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在长视频理解中因计算成本高而受限，KV压缩方法在高压缩比下信息损失严重。

Method: 提出Video-X^2L，包含双层KV压缩（生成L-KVs和H-KVs）和选择性KV重加载（解码阶段动态选择KV）。

Result: 在多个LVU基准测试中表现优异，显著优于现有KV压缩方法并节省计算成本。

Conclusion: Video-X^2L是一种简单高效的长视频理解解决方案，兼具信息保留和计算效率。

Abstract: Long-video understanding (LVU) remains a severe challenge for existing
multimodal large language models (MLLMs), primarily due to the prohibitive
computational cost. Recent approaches have explored KV compression to mitigate
this issue, but they often suffer from significant information loss at high
compression ratios. In this paper, we introduce Video-X^2L, which flexibly
preserves critical video information for each LVU task. Video-X^2L involves two
key operations. The first one is called bi-level KV compression. During the
MLLM's pre-filling stage, Video-X^2L generates two types of compressed KVs:
low-compression KVs (L-KVs) to capture fine-grained video details and
high-compression KVs (H-KVs) to offer compact video representations. The second
one is called selective KV re-loading. During the MLLM's decoding stage,
Video-X^2L selectively re-loads L-KVs for the most critical video chunks while
using H-KVs for other less important ones. This allows the MLLM to fully
utilize task-specific information while maintaining the overall compactness.
Video-X^2L is simple yet effective: it is free from additional training and
directly compatible with existing KV-compressible MLLMs. We evaluate Video-X^2L
with a variety of popular LVU benchmarks, including VideoMME, MLVU,
LongVideoBench, and VNBench. Our experiment result shows that Video-X^2L
outperforms existing KV-compression methods by a huge advantage while
substantially saving the computation cost.

TL;DR: 论文提出GroundFlow模块，用于提升3D点云序列定位任务中的时序推理能力，显著提高了现有3DVG方法的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3DVG方法在处理多步骤文本指令时缺乏对时序信息的有效利用，导致无法处理SG3D任务中的代词依赖问题。

Method: 提出GroundFlow模块，选择性提取短期和长期步骤信息，增强对历史信息的理解。

Result: 在SG3D基准测试中，GroundFlow显著提升了3DVG方法的准确性（+7.5%和+10.2%），并优于预训练的3D大语言模型。

Conclusion: GroundFlow为3DVG模型引入了时序推理能力，在SG3D任务中实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Sequential grounding in 3D point clouds (SG3D) refers to locating sequences
of objects by following text instructions for a daily activity with detailed
steps. Current 3D visual grounding (3DVG) methods treat text instructions with
multiple steps as a whole, without extracting useful temporal information from
each step. However, the instructions in SG3D often contain pronouns such as
"it", "here" and "the same" to make language expressions concise. This requires
grounding methods to understand the context and retrieve relevant information
from previous steps to correctly locate object sequences. Due to the lack of an
effective module for collecting related historical information,
state-of-the-art 3DVG methods face significant challenges in adapting to the
SG3D task. To fill this gap, we propose GroundFlow -- a plug-in module for
temporal reasoning on 3D point cloud sequential grounding. Firstly, we
demonstrate that integrating GroundFlow improves the task accuracy of 3DVG
baseline methods by a large margin (+7.5\% and +10.2\%) in the SG3D benchmark,
even outperforming a 3D large language model pre-trained on various datasets.
Furthermore, we selectively extract both short-term and long-term step
information based on its relevance to the current instruction, enabling
GroundFlow to take a comprehensive view of historical information and maintain
its temporal understanding advantage as step counts increase. Overall, our work
introduces temporal reasoning capabilities to existing 3DVG models and achieves
state-of-the-art performance in the SG3D benchmark across five datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有医学图像分析系统任务单一、缺乏灵活性的问题。

Method: 使用LLM（Llama-4-17B）进行任务规划，模块化CNN（DeepFusionLab）进行图像处理，动态路由任务特定的预训练权重。

Result: 在19个公共数据集上验证，任务执行正确率达97%，推理延迟2.5秒，分割和分类性能优异。

Conclusion: MedPrompt通过结合LLM的解释性和模块化CNN的效率，实现了可扩展的、基于提示的医学图像分析。

Abstract: Current medical image analysis systems are typically task-specific, requiring
separate models for classification and segmentation, and lack the flexibility
to support user-defined workflows. To address these challenges, we introduce
MedPrompt, a unified framework that combines a few-shot prompted Large Language
Model (Llama-4-17B) for high-level task planning with a modular Convolutional
Neural Network (DeepFusionLab) for low-level image processing. The LLM
interprets user instructions and generates structured output to dynamically
route task-specific pretrained weights. This weight routing approach avoids
retraining the entire framework when adding new tasks-only task-specific
weights are required, enhancing scalability and deployment. We evaluated
MedPrompt across 19 public datasets, covering 12 tasks spanning 5 imaging
modalities. The system achieves a 97% end-to-end correctness in interpreting
and executing prompt-driven instructions, with an average inference latency of
2.5 seconds, making it suitable for near real-time applications. DeepFusionLab
achieves competitive segmentation accuracy (e.g., Dice 0.9856 on lungs) and
strong classification performance (F1 0.9744 on tuberculosis). Overall,
MedPrompt enables scalable, prompt-driven medical imaging by combining the
interpretability of LLMs with the efficiency of modular CNNs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文介绍了BitMark，一种针对Infinity文本到图像模型的鲁棒比特水印框架，旨在防止模型崩溃。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成模型输出的内容被广泛使用并可能被重新训练，导致模型性能退化（模型崩溃），需要一种方法来可靠识别生成内容。

Method: 提出BitMark，通过在Infinity图像生成过程中在比特级别嵌入水印，保持视觉保真度和生成速度，同时抵抗去除技术。

Result: BitMark具有高放射性，即使水印图像被用于训练其他生成模型，水印仍可检测。

Conclusion: BitMark为预防图像生成模型的崩溃提供了可靠的方法。

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image models like Infinity generate photorealistic
images at an unprecedented speed. These models operate in a bitwise
autoregressive manner over a discrete set of tokens that is practically
infinite in size. However, their impressive generative power comes with a
growing risk: as their outputs increasingly populate the Internet, they are
likely to be scraped and reused as training data-potentially by the very same
models. This phenomenon has been shown to lead to model collapse, where
repeated training on generated content, especially from the models' own
previous versions, causes a gradual degradation in performance. A promising
mitigation strategy is watermarking, which embeds human-imperceptible yet
detectable signals into generated images-enabling the identification of
generated content. In this work, we introduce BitMark, a robust bitwise
watermarking framework for Infinity. Our method embeds a watermark directly at
the bit level of the token stream across multiple scales (also referred to as
resolutions) during Infinity's image generation process. Our bitwise watermark
subtly influences the bits to preserve visual fidelity and generation speed
while remaining robust against a spectrum of removal techniques. Furthermore,
it exhibits high radioactivity, i.e., when watermarked generated images are
used to train another image generative model, this second model's outputs will
also carry the watermark. The radioactive traces remain detectable even when
only fine-tuning diffusion or image autoregressive models on images watermarked
with our BitMark. Overall, our approach provides a principled step toward
preventing model collapse in image generative models by enabling reliable
detection of generated outputs.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖预训练模型或合成数据，性能受限于模型能力或数据质量。本文发现高质量参考集对OVS至关重要。

Method: 设计了一个数据质量导向的框架，包括构建高质量参考集的数据流程和基于相似性的检索方法。

Result: 在十个基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于所有现有无需训练的OVS方法。

Conclusion: 数据为中心的设计对无需训练的OVS任务至关重要，该方法为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Training-free open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVS) aims to segment
images given a set of arbitrary textual categories without costly model
fine-tuning. Existing solutions often explore attention mechanisms of
pre-trained models, such as CLIP, or generate synthetic data and design complex
retrieval processes to perform OVS. However, their performance is limited by
the capability of reliant models or the suboptimal quality of reference sets.
In this work, we investigate the largely overlooked data quality problem for
this challenging dense scene understanding task, and identify that a
high-quality reference set can significantly benefit training-free OVS. With
this observation, we introduce a data-quality-oriented framework, comprising a
data pipeline to construct a reference set with well-paired segment-text
embeddings and a simple similarity-based retrieval to unveil the essential
effect of data. Remarkably, extensive evaluations on ten benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms all existing training-free OVS
approaches, highlighting the importance of data-centric design for advancing
OVS without training. Our code is available at https://github.com/xiweix/ReME .

Conclusion: DiMPLe在多模态学习中实现了更好的泛化和鲁棒性。

Abstract: We introduce DiMPLe (Disentangled Multi-Modal Prompt Learning), a novel
approach to disentangle invariant and spurious features across vision and
language modalities in multi-modal learning. Spurious correlations in visual
data often hinder out-of-distribution (OOD) performance. Unlike prior methods
focusing solely on image features, DiMPLe disentangles features within and
across modalities while maintaining consistent alignment, enabling better
generalization to novel classes and robustness to distribution shifts. Our
method combines three key objectives: (1) mutual information minimization
between invariant and spurious features, (2) spurious feature regularization,
and (3) contrastive learning on invariant features. Extensive experiments
demonstrate DiMPLe demonstrates superior performance compared to CoOp-OOD, when
averaged across 11 diverse datasets, and achieves absolute gains of 15.27 in
base class accuracy and 44.31 in novel class accuracy.

Result: 在五个基准HMS数据集上进行了广泛实验，使用不同特征提取器均取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: TR²C方法通过优化表示和亲和力学习，显著提升了HMS任务的性能。

Abstract: Human Motion Segmentation (HMS), which aims to partition videos into
non-overlapping human motions, has attracted increasing research attention
recently. Existing approaches for HMS are mainly dominated by subspace
clustering methods, which are grounded on the assumption that high-dimensional
temporal data align with a Union-of-Subspaces (UoS) distribution. However, the
frames in video capturing complex human motions with cluttered backgrounds may
not align well with the UoS distribution. In this paper, we propose a novel
approach for HMS, named Temporal Rate Reduction Clustering
($\text{TR}^2\text{C}$), which jointly learns structured representations and
affinity to segment the frame sequences in video. Specifically, the structured
representations learned by $\text{TR}^2\text{C}$ maintain temporally consistent
and align well with a UoS structure, which is favorable for the HMS task. We
conduct extensive experiments on five benchmark HMS datasets and achieve
state-of-the-art performances with different feature extractors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实中的目标检测系统需要同时应对新类别学习和环境变化，现有方法（CIOD和DIOD）仅解决单一方面，存在局限性。

Method: 提出DuET框架，基于任务算术模型合并，结合方向一致性损失，支持多种检测器。

Result: 在Pascal Series和Diverse Weather Series上，DuET分别提升了13.12%和11.39%的RAI指标，同时保持高平均保留率。

Conclusion: DuIOD和DuET为类别和域增量学习提供了高效解决方案，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Real-world object detection systems, such as those in autonomous driving and
surveillance, must continuously learn new object categories and simultaneously
adapt to changing environmental conditions. Existing approaches, Class
Incremental Object Detection (CIOD) and Domain Incremental Object Detection
(DIOD) only address one aspect of this challenge. CIOD struggles in unseen
domains, while DIOD suffers from catastrophic forgetting when learning new
classes, limiting their real-world applicability. To overcome these
limitations, we introduce Dual Incremental Object Detection (DuIOD), a more
practical setting that simultaneously handles class and domain shifts in an
exemplar-free manner. We propose DuET, a Task Arithmetic-based model merging
framework that enables stable incremental learning while mitigating sign
conflicts through a novel Directional Consistency Loss. Unlike prior methods,
DuET is detector-agnostic, allowing models like YOLO11 and RT-DETR to function
as real-time incremental object detectors. To comprehensively evaluate both
retention and adaptation, we introduce the Retention-Adaptability Index (RAI),
which combines the Average Retention Index (Avg RI) for catastrophic forgetting
and the Average Generalization Index for domain adaptability into a common
ground. Extensive experiments on the Pascal Series and Diverse Weather Series
demonstrate DuET's effectiveness, achieving a +13.12% RAI improvement while
preserving 89.3% Avg RI on the Pascal Series (4 tasks), as well as a +11.39%
RAI improvement with 88.57% Avg RI on the Diverse Weather Series (3 tasks),
outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Video virtual try-on aims to naturally fit a garment to a target person in
consecutive video frames. It is a challenging task, on the one hand, the output
video should be in good spatial-temporal consistency, on the other hand, the
details of the given garment need to be preserved well in all the frames.
Naively using image-based try-on methods frame by frame can get poor results
due to severe inconsistency. Recent diffusion-based video try-on methods,
though very few, happen to coincide with a similar solution: inserting temporal
attention into image-based try-on model to adapt it for video try-on task,
which have shown improvements but there still exist inconsistency problems. In
this paper, we propose ViTI (Video Try-on Inpainter), formulate and implement
video virtual try-on as a conditional video inpainting task, which is different
from previous methods. In this way, we start with a video generation problem
instead of an image-based try-on problem, which from the beginning has a better
spatial-temporal consistency. Specifically, at first we build a video
inpainting framework based on Diffusion Transformer with full 3D
spatial-temporal attention, and then we progressively adapt it for video
garment inpainting, with a collection of masking strategies and multi-stage
training. After these steps, the model can inpaint the masked garment area with
appropriate garment pixels according to the prompt with good spatial-temporal
consistency. Finally, as other try-on methods, garment condition is added to
the model to make sure the inpainted garment appearance and details are as
expected. Both quantitative and qualitative experimental results show that ViTI
is superior to previous works.

Conclusion: 提出的TIA框架和WordCon方法有效提升了单词级排版控制的精确性和效率，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Achieving precise word-level typography control within generated images
remains a persistent challenge. To address it, we newly construct a word-level
controlled scene text dataset and introduce the Text-Image Alignment (TIA)
framework. This framework leverages cross-modal correspondence between text and
local image regions provided by grounding models to enhance the Text-to-Image
(T2I) model training. Furthermore, we propose WordCon, a hybrid
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method. WordCon reparameterizes
selective key parameters, improving both efficiency and portability. This
allows seamless integration into diverse pipelines, including artistic text
rendering, text editing, and image-conditioned text rendering. To further
enhance controllability, the masked loss at the latent level is applied to
guide the model to concentrate on learning the text region in the image, and
the joint-attention loss provides feature-level supervision to promote
disentanglement between different words. Both qualitative and quantitative
results demonstrate the superiority of our method to the state of the art. The
datasets and source code will be available for academic use.

Motivation: 现有手术视频生成方法缺乏对手术动作和阶段的精细控制，无法保持一致性。

Method: HieraSurg采用两阶段模型：先预测粗粒度语义变化，再通过细粒度视觉特征生成视频。

Result: 在胆囊切除术视频生成任务中，模型在定量和定性上均优于现有方法，并能生成更高帧率的视频。

Conclusion: HieraSurg展示了在多层次抽象信息下的强大生成能力，具有实际手术应用的潜力。

Abstract: Surgical Video Synthesis has emerged as a promising research direction
following the success of diffusion models in general-domain video generation.
Although existing approaches achieve high-quality video generation, most are
unconditional and fail to maintain consistency with surgical actions and
phases, lacking the surgical understanding and fine-grained guidance necessary
for factual simulation. We address these challenges by proposing HieraSurg, a
hierarchy-aware surgical video generation framework consisting of two
specialized diffusion models. Given a surgical phase and an initial frame,
HieraSurg first predicts future coarse-grained semantic changes through a
segmentation prediction model. The final video is then generated by a
second-stage model that augments these temporal segmentation maps with
fine-grained visual features, leading to effective texture rendering and
integration of semantic information in the video space. Our approach leverages
surgical information at multiple levels of abstraction, including surgical
phase, action triplets, and panoptic segmentation maps. The experimental
results on Cholecystectomy Surgical Video Generation demonstrate that the model
significantly outperforms prior work both quantitatively and qualitatively,
showing strong generalization capabilities and the ability to generate higher
frame-rate videos. The model exhibits particularly fine-grained adherence when
provided with existing segmentation maps, suggesting its potential for
practical surgical applications.

Motivation: 解决遥感领域中持续学习需要大量标注数据的高成本问题，提出自监督学习方法以减少对标注数据的依赖。

Method: 结合数据混合（保留历史数据分布）和模型混合知识蒸馏（同时利用过去和当前模型知识），在数据和模型层面正则化MAE。

Result: CoSMAE在MAE上比现有持续学习方法提升高达4.94%。

Conclusion: CoSMAE通过自监督学习和混合策略有效减少灾难性遗忘，提升了持续学习的性能。

Abstract: The development of continual learning (CL) methods, which aim to learn new
tasks in a sequential manner from the training data acquired continuously, has
gained great attention in remote sensing (RS). The existing CL methods in RS,
while learning new tasks, enhance robustness towards catastrophic forgetting.
This is achieved by using a large number of labeled training samples, which is
costly and not always feasible to gather in RS. To address this problem, we
propose a novel continual self-supervised learning method in the context of
masked autoencoders (denoted as CoSMAE). The proposed CoSMAE consists of two
components: i) data mixup; and ii) model mixup knowledge distillation. Data
mixup is associated with retaining information on previous data distributions
by interpolating images from the current task with those from the previous
tasks. Model mixup knowledge distillation is associated with distilling
knowledge from past models and the current model simultaneously by
interpolating their model weights to form a teacher for the knowledge
distillation. The two components complement each other to regularize the MAE at
the data and model levels to facilitate better generalization across tasks and
reduce the risk of catastrophic forgetting. Experimental results show that
CoSMAE achieves significant improvements of up to 4.94% over state-of-the-art
CL methods applied to MAE. Our code is publicly available at:

Abstract: Visual grounding in text-rich document images is a critical yet underexplored
challenge for document intelligence and visual question answering (VQA)
systems. We present \drishtikon, a multi-granular visual grounding framework
designed to enhance interpretability and trust in VQA for complex, multilingual

models, and a novel region matching algorithm to accurately localize answer
spans at block, line, word, and point levels. We curate a new benchmark from
the CircularsVQA test set, providing fine-grained, human-verified annotations
across multiple granularities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method achieves state-of-the-art grounding accuracy, with line-level
granularity offering the best trade-off between precision and recall. Ablation
studies further highlight the benefits of multi-block and multi-line reasoning.
Comparative evaluations with leading vision-language models reveal the
limitations of current VLMs in precise localization, underscoring the
effectiveness of our structured, alignment-based approach. Our findings pave
the way for more robust and interpretable document understanding systems in

Conclusion: 整合关键点的数据能有效增强多模态模型在人体中心视觉理解任务中的表现。

Abstract: Current vision-language models (VLMs) are well-adapted for general visual
understanding tasks. However, they perform inadequately when handling complex
visual tasks related to human poses and actions due to the lack of specialized
vision-language instruction-following data. We introduce a method for
generating such data by integrating human keypoints with traditional visual
features such as captions and bounding boxes, enabling more precise
understanding of human-centric scenes. Our approach constructs a dataset
comprising 200,328 samples tailored to fine-tune models for human-centric
tasks, focusing on three areas: conversation, detailed description, and complex
reasoning. We establish an Extended Human Pose and Action Understanding
Benchmark (E-HPAUB) to assess model performance on human pose and action
understanding. We fine-tune the LLaVA-1.5-7B model using this dataset and
evaluate our resulting LLaVA-Pose model on the benchmark, achieving significant
improvements. Experimental results show an overall improvement of 33.2%
compared to the original LLaVA-1.5-7B model. These findings highlight the
effectiveness of keypoint-integrated data in enhancing multimodal models for
human-centric visual understanding. Code is available at

Abstract: Developing meaningful and efficient representations that separate the
fundamental structure of the data generation mechanism is crucial in
representation learning. However, Disentangled Representation Learning has not
fully shown its potential on real images, because of correlated generative
factors, their resolution and limited access to ground truth labels.
Specifically on the latter, we investigate the possibility of leveraging
synthetic data to learn general-purpose disentangled representations applicable
to real data, discussing the effect of fine-tuning and what properties of
disentanglement are preserved after the transfer. We provide an extensive
empirical study to address these issues. In addition, we propose a new
interpretable intervention-based metric, to measure the quality of factors
encoding in the representation. Our results indicate that some level of
disentanglement, transferring a representation from synthetic to real data, is
possible and effective.

Abstract: Surgical workflow analysis is essential in robot-assisted surgeries, yet the
long duration of such procedures poses significant challenges for comprehensive
video analysis. Recent approaches have predominantly relied on transformer
models; however, their quadratic attention mechanism restricts efficient
processing of lengthy surgical videos. In this paper, we propose a novel
hierarchical input-dependent state space model that leverages the linear
scaling property of state space models to enable decision making on full-length
videos while capturing both local and global dynamics. Our framework
incorporates a temporally consistent visual feature extractor, which appends a
state space model head to a visual feature extractor to propagate temporal
information. The proposed model consists of two key modules: a
local-aggregation state space model block that effectively captures intricate
local dynamics, and a global-relation state space model block that models
temporal dependencies across the entire video. The model is trained using a
hybrid discrete-continuous supervision strategy, where both signals of discrete
phase labels and continuous phase progresses are propagated through the
network. Experiments have shown that our method outperforms the current
state-of-the-art methods by a large margin (+2.8% on Cholec80, +4.3% on
MICCAI2016, and +12.9% on Heichole datasets). Code will be publicly available

Abstract: Panoptic segmentation of 3D scenes, involving the segmentation and
classification of object instances in a dense 3D reconstruction of a scene, is
a challenging problem, especially when relying solely on unposed 2D images.
Existing approaches typically leverage off-the-shelf models to extract
per-frame 2D panoptic segmentations, before optimizing an implicit geometric
representation (often based on NeRF) to integrate and fuse the 2D predictions.
We argue that relying on 2D panoptic segmentation for a problem inherently 3D
and multi-view is likely suboptimal as it fails to leverage the full potential
of spatial relationships across views. In addition to requiring camera
parameters, these approaches also necessitate computationally expensive
test-time optimization for each scene. Instead, in this work, we propose a
unified and integrated approach PanSt3R, which eliminates the need for
test-time optimization by jointly predicting 3D geometry and multi-view
panoptic segmentation in a single forward pass. Our approach builds upon recent
advances in 3D reconstruction, specifically upon MUSt3R, a scalable multi-view
version of DUSt3R, and enhances it with semantic awareness and multi-view
panoptic segmentation capabilities. We additionally revisit the standard
post-processing mask merging procedure and introduce a more principled approach
for multi-view segmentation. We also introduce a simple method for generating
novel-view predictions based on the predictions of PanSt3R and vanilla 3DGS.
Overall, the proposed PanSt3R is conceptually simple, yet fast and scalable,
and achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, while being
orders of magnitude faster than existing methods.

Conclusion: 该研究为电磁逆散射问题提供了新的视角，推动了电磁成像的实际应用。

Abstract: Solving Electromagnetic Inverse Scattering Problems (EISP) is fundamental in
applications such as medical imaging, where the goal is to reconstruct the
relative permittivity from scattered electromagnetic field. This inverse
process is inherently ill-posed and highly nonlinear, making it particularly
challenging. A recent machine learning-based approach, Img-Interiors, shows
promising results by leveraging continuous implicit functions. However, it
requires case-specific optimization, lacks generalization to unseen data, and
fails under sparse transmitter setups (e.g., with only one transmitter). To
address these limitations, we revisit EISP from a physics-informed perspective,
reformulating it as a two stage inverse transmission-scattering process. This
formulation reveals the induced current as a generalizable intermediate
representation, effectively decoupling the nonlinear scattering process from
the ill-posed inverse problem. Built on this insight, we propose the first
generalizable physics-driven framework for EISP, comprising a current estimator
and a permittivity solver, working in an end-to-end manner. The current
estimator explicitly learns the induced current as a physical bridge between
the incident and scattered field, while the permittivity solver computes the
relative permittivity directly from the estimated induced current. This design
enables data-driven training and generalizable feed-forward prediction of
relative permittivity on unseen data while maintaining strong robustness to
transmitter sparsity. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches in reconstruction accuracy, generalization, and
robustness. This work offers a fundamentally new perspective on electromagnetic
inverse scattering and represents a major step toward cost-effective practical
solutions for electromagnetic imaging.

Conclusion: ShotBench和ShotQA为AI驱动的电影理解和生成提供了重要工具，ShotVL的表现推动了该领域的进步。

Abstract: Cinematography, the fundamental visual language of film, is essential for
conveying narrative, emotion, and aesthetic quality. While recent
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate strong general visual understanding,
their proficiency in comprehending the nuanced cinematic grammar embedded
within individual shots remains largely unexplored and lacks robust evaluation.
This critical gap limits both fine-grained visual comprehension and the
precision of AI-assisted video generation. To address this, we introduce
\textbf{ShotBench}, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for
cinematic language understanding. It features over 3.5k expert-annotated QA
pairs from images and video clips, meticulously curated from over 200 acclaimed
(predominantly Oscar-nominated) films and spanning eight key cinematography
dimensions. Our evaluation of 24 leading VLMs on ShotBench reveals their
substantial limitations: even the top-performing model achieves less than 60\%
average accuracy, particularly struggling with fine-grained visual cues and
complex spatial reasoning. To catalyze advancement in this domain, we construct
\textbf{ShotQA}, a large-scale multimodal dataset comprising approximately 70k
cinematic QA pairs. Leveraging ShotQA, we develop \textbf{ShotVL} through
supervised fine-tuning and Group Relative Policy Optimization. ShotVL
significantly outperforms all existing open-source and proprietary models on
ShotBench, establishing new \textbf{state-of-the-art} performance. We

Abstract: 2D scene graphs provide a structural and explainable framework for scene
understanding. However, current work still struggles with the lack of accurate
scene graph data. To overcome this data bottleneck, we present CoPa-SG, a
synthetic scene graph dataset with highly precise ground truth and exhaustive
relation annotations between all objects. Moreover, we introduce parametric and
proto-relations, two new fundamental concepts for scene graphs. The former
provides a much more fine-grained representation than its traditional
counterpart by enriching relations with additional parameters such as angles or
distances. The latter encodes hypothetical relations in a scene graph and
describes how relations would form if new objects are placed in the scene.
Using CoPa-SG, we compare the performance of various scene graph generation
models. We demonstrate how our new relation types can be integrated in
downstream applications to enhance planning and reasoning capabilities.

Result: 在RGB-D Scenes V2和7-Scenes数据集上实现了最先进的图像到点云配准性能。

Conclusion: CAA和GOS有效提升了配准精度，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Detection-free methods typically follow a coarse-to-fine pipeline, extracting
image and point cloud features for patch-level matching and refining dense
pixel-to-point correspondences. However, differences in feature channel
attention between images and point clouds may lead to degraded matching
results, ultimately impairing registration accuracy. Furthermore, similar
structures in the scene could lead to redundant correspondences in cross-modal
matching. To address these issues, we propose Channel Adaptive Adjustment
Module (CAA) and Global Optimal Selection Module (GOS). CAA enhances
intra-modal features and suppresses cross-modal sensitivity, while GOS replaces
local selection with global optimization. Experiments on RGB-D Scenes V2 and
7-Scenes demonstrate the superiority of our method, achieving state-of-the-art
performance in image-to-point cloud registration.

Abstract: Few-shot industrial anomaly detection (FS-IAD) presents a critical challenge
for practical automated inspection systems operating in data-scarce
environments. While existing approaches predominantly focus on deriving
prototypes from limited normal samples, they typically neglect to
systematically incorporate query image statistics to enhance prototype
representativeness. To address this issue, we propose FastRef, a novel and
efficient prototype refinement framework for FS-IAD. Our method operates
through an iterative two-stage process: (1) characteristic transfer from query
features to prototypes via an optimizable transformation matrix, and (2)
anomaly suppression through prototype alignment. The characteristic transfer is
achieved through linear reconstruction of query features from prototypes, while
the anomaly suppression addresses a key observation in FS-IAD that unlike
conventional IAD with abundant normal prototypes, the limited-sample setting
makes anomaly reconstruction more probable. Therefore, we employ optimal
transport (OT) for non-Gaussian sampled features to measure and minimize the
gap between prototypes and their refined counterparts for anomaly suppression.
For comprehensive evaluation, we integrate FastRef with three competitive

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种端到端框架，直接从多视角边缘图重建3D参数曲线，避免了传统两阶段方法的误差累积。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有两阶段方法（先重建边缘点云再拟合参数曲线）存在优化间隙导致的误差累积问题，需一种直接优化参数曲线的方法。

Method: 提出一种双向耦合机制，将参数曲线与边缘导向的高斯组件结合，形成可微渲染的曲线感知高斯表示（CurveGaussian），并引入动态自适应拓扑优化框架。

Result: 在ABC数据集和真实场景基准测试中表现优于两阶段方法，重建结果更干净、鲁棒，且训练参数更少。

Conclusion: 该方法通过直接优化参数曲线，实现了更高效率和性能，为3D曲线重建提供了新思路。

Abstract: This paper presents an end-to-end framework for reconstructing 3D parametric
curves directly from multi-view edge maps. Contrasting with existing two-stage
methods that follow a sequential ``edge point cloud reconstruction and
parametric curve fitting'' pipeline, our one-stage approach optimizes 3D
parametric curves directly from 2D edge maps, eliminating error accumulation
caused by the inherent optimization gap between disconnected stages. However,
parametric curves inherently lack suitability for rendering-based multi-view
optimization, necessitating a complementary representation that preserves their
geometric properties while enabling differentiable rendering. We propose a
novel bi-directional coupling mechanism between parametric curves and
edge-oriented Gaussian components. This tight correspondence formulates a
curve-aware Gaussian representation, \textbf{CurveGaussian}, that enables
differentiable rendering of 3D curves, allowing direct optimization guided by
multi-view evidence. Furthermore, we introduce a dynamically adaptive topology
optimization framework during training to refine curve structures through
linearization, merging, splitting, and pruning operations. Comprehensive
evaluations on the ABC dataset and real-world benchmarks demonstrate our
one-stage method's superiority over two-stage alternatives, particularly in
producing cleaner and more robust reconstructions. Additionally, by directly
optimizing parametric curves, our method significantly reduces the parameter
count during training, achieving both higher efficiency and superior
performance compared to existing approaches.

TL;DR: XVerse模型通过将参考图像转换为特定令牌的文本流偏移，实现了对多主题图像生成的精确独立控制，避免了属性纠缠和编辑性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在文本到图像生成中难以实现对多主题的精细控制和编辑性，常导致属性纠缠或伪影。

Method: XVerse通过将参考图像转换为令牌特定文本流偏移，独立控制每个主题，保持图像潜在特征不变。

Result: XVerse实现了高保真、可编辑的多主题图像合成，并显著提升了个性化和复杂场景生成能力。

Conclusion: XVerse在多主题控制生成方面取得了显著进展，为复杂场景生成提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: Achieving fine-grained control over subject identity and semantic attributes
(pose, style, lighting) in text-to-image generation, particularly for multiple
subjects, often undermines the editability and coherence of Diffusion
Transformers (DiTs). Many approaches introduce artifacts or suffer from
attribute entanglement. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel
multi-subject controlled generation model XVerse. By transforming reference
images into offsets for token-specific text-stream modulation, XVerse allows
for precise and independent control for specific subject without disrupting
image latents or features. Consequently, XVerse offers high-fidelity, editable
multi-subject image synthesis with robust control over individual subject
characteristics and semantic attributes. This advancement significantly
improves personalized and complex scene generation capabilities.

TL;DR: HyperSORT是一种利用超网络预测UNet参数的框架，用于识别和处理医学影像数据集中的异质性偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像数据集中存在多种偏差（如错误标签和不一致的标注风格），这些偏差会影响深度学习分割网络的性能，但识别和表征这些偏差是一项繁琐且具有挑战性的任务。

Method: HyperSORT通过超网络从表示图像和标注变异性的潜在向量预测UNet参数，并联合学习超网络参数和每个训练样本的潜在向量集合。

Result: 在合成的AMOS数据集和包含真实偏差的TotalSegmentator数据集上验证，HyperSORT能够识别系统性偏差和错误样本，并生成结构化的数据集映射。

Conclusion: HyperSORT能够有效识别和处理医学影像数据集中的偏差，为分割任务提供鲁棒且多样化的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical imaging datasets often contain heterogeneous biases ranging from
erroneous labels to inconsistent labeling styles. Such biases can negatively
impact deep segmentation networks performance. Yet, the identification and
characterization of such biases is a particularly tedious and challenging task.
In this paper, we introduce HyperSORT, a framework using a hyper-network
predicting UNets' parameters from latent vectors representing both the image
and annotation variability. The hyper-network parameters and the latent vector
collection corresponding to each data sample from the training set are jointly
learned. Hence, instead of optimizing a single neural network to fit a dataset,
HyperSORT learns a complex distribution of UNet parameters where low density
areas can capture noise-specific patterns while larger modes robustly segment
organs in differentiated but meaningful manners. We validate our method on two
3D abdominal CT public datasets: first a synthetically perturbed version of the
AMOS dataset, and TotalSegmentator, a large scale dataset containing real
unknown biases and errors. Our experiments show that HyperSORT creates a
structured mapping of the dataset allowing the identification of relevant
systematic biases and erroneous samples. Latent space clusters yield UNet
parameters performing the segmentation task in accordance with the underlying
learned systematic bias. The code and our analysis of the TotalSegmentator
dataset are made available: https://github.com/ImFusionGmbH/HyperSORT

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过迁移学习和模型微调技术，可以有效解决非典型有丝分裂分类这一难题。所有代码和数据已在GitHub上公开。

Abstract: Atypical mitoses mark a deviation in the cell division process that can be an
independent prognostically relevant marker for tumor malignancy. However, their
identification remains challenging due to low prevalence, at times subtle
morphological differences from normal mitoses, low inter-rater agreement among
pathologists, and class imbalance in datasets. Building on the Atypical Mitosis
dataset for Breast Cancer (AMi-Br), this study presents a comprehensive
benchmark comparing deep learning approaches for automated atypical mitotic
figure (AMF) classification, including baseline models, foundation models with
linear probing, and foundation models fine-tuned with low-rank adaptation
(LoRA). For rigorous evaluation, we further introduce two new hold-out AMF
datasets - AtNorM-Br, a dataset of mitoses from the The TCGA breast cancer
cohort, and AtNorM-MD, a multi-domain dataset of mitoses from the MIDOG++
training set. We found average balanced accuracy values of up to 0.8135,
0.7696, and 0.7705 on the in-domain AMi-Br and the out-of-domain AtNorm-Br and
AtNorM-MD datasets, respectively, with the results being particularly good for
LoRA-based adaptation of the Virchow-line of foundation models. Our work shows
that atypical mitosis classification, while being a challenging problem, can be
effectively addressed through the use of recent advances in transfer learning
and model fine-tuning techniques. We make available all code and data used in

Conclusion: 该方法在精确定位和外观控制上表现出色，适用于复杂场景的物体编辑。

Abstract: Image editing approaches have become more powerful and flexible with the
advent of powerful text-conditioned generative models. However, placing objects
in an environment with a precise location and orientation still remains a
challenge, as this typically requires carefully crafted inpainting masks or
prompts. In this work, we show that a carefully designed visual map, combined
with coarse object masks, is sufficient for high quality object placement. We
design a conditioning signal that resolves ambiguities, while being flexible
enough to allow for changing of shapes or object orientations. By building on
an inpainting model, we leave the background intact by design, in contrast to
methods that model objects and background jointly. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method in the automotive setting, where we compare
different conditioning signals in novel object placement tasks. These tasks are
designed to measure edit quality not only in terms of appearance, but also in
terms of pose and location accuracy, including cases that require non-trivial
shape changes. Lastly, we show that fine location control can be combined with
appearance control to place existing objects in precise locations in a scene.

Abstract: Underground mining operations face significant safety challenges that make
emergency response capabilities crucial. While robots have shown promise in
assisting with search and rescue operations, their effectiveness depends on
reliable miner detection capabilities. Deep learning algorithms offer potential
solutions for automated miner detection, but require comprehensive training
datasets, which are currently lacking for underground mining environments. This
paper presents a novel thermal imaging dataset specifically designed to enable
the development and validation of miner detection systems for potential
emergency applications. We systematically captured thermal imagery of various
mining activities and scenarios to create a robust foundation for detection
algorithms. To establish baseline performance metrics, we evaluated several
state-of-the-art object detection algorithms including YOLOv8, YOLOv10, YOLO11,
and RT-DETR on our dataset. While not exhaustive of all possible emergency
situations, this dataset serves as a crucial first step toward developing
reliable thermal-based miner detection systems that could eventually be
deployed in real emergency scenarios. This work demonstrates the feasibility of
using thermal imaging for miner detection and establishes a foundation for
future research in this critical safety application.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高引导尺度在增强条件扩散模型性能的同时，常导致过饱和和不真实伪影，低频信号中的冗余信息积累是主要原因。

Method: 提出LF-CFG，通过自适应阈值定位冗余信息，分析低频信息变化率确定合理阈值，并采用降权策略减少冗余信息影响。

Result: 实验表明，LF-CFG在多种扩散模型（如Stable Diffusion-XL等）中有效缓解了过饱和和不真实伪影。

Conclusion: LF-CFG通过低频信号改进，显著提升了条件扩散模型的生成质量。

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) succeeds in condition diffusion models that
use a guidance scale to balance the influence of conditional and unconditional
terms. A high guidance scale is used to enhance the performance of the
conditional term. However, the high guidance scale often results in
oversaturation and unrealistic artifacts. In this paper, we introduce a new
perspective based on low-frequency signals, identifying the accumulation of
redundant information in these signals as the key factor behind oversaturation
and unrealistic artifacts. Building on this insight, we propose low-frequency
improved classifier-free guidance (LF-CFG) to mitigate these issues.
Specifically, we introduce an adaptive threshold-based measurement to pinpoint
the locations of redundant information. We determine a reasonable threshold by
analyzing the change rate of low-frequency information between prior and
current steps. We then apply a down-weight strategy to reduce the impact of
redundant information in the low-frequency signals. Experimental results
demonstrate that LF-CFG effectively alleviates oversaturation and unrealistic
artifacts across various diffusion models, including Stable Diffusion-XL,
Stable Diffusion 2.1, 3.0, 3.5, and SiT-XL.

Motivation: 转向运动计数数据对交通信号设计、交叉口规划和拥堵分析至关重要，但现有方法难以适应多样化的交通模式。

Method: 开发了基于视觉的跟踪系统估计TMC，结合仿真工具SUMO进行信号评估，并提出了动态、静态和混合信号配置方法。

Conclusion: 混合信号方法能有效适应多样化的交通模式，尤其在交通分布不均的区域表现更优。

Abstract: The turning movement count data is crucial for traffic signal design,
intersection geometry planning, traffic flow, and congestion analysis. This
work proposes three methods called dynamic, static, and hybrid configuration
for TMC-based traffic signals. A vision-based tracking system is developed to
estimate the TMC of six intersections in Las Vegas using traffic cameras. The
intersection design, route (e.g. vehicle movement directions), and signal
configuration files with compatible formats are synthesized and imported into
Simulation of Urban MObility for signal evaluation with realistic data. The
initial experimental results based on estimated waiting times indicate that the
cycle time of 90 and 120 seconds works best for all intersections. In addition,
four intersections show better performance for dynamic signal timing
configuration, and the other two with lower performance have a lower ratio of
total vehicle count to total lanes of the intersection leg. Since daily traffic
flow often exhibits a bimodal pattern, we propose a hybrid signal method that
switches between dynamic and static methods, adapting to peak and off-peak
traffic conditions for improved flow management. So, a built-in traffic
generator module creates vehicle routes for 4 hours, including peak hours, and
a signal design module produces signal schedule cycles according to static,
dynamic, and hybrid methods. Vehicle count distributions are weighted
differently for each zone (i.e., West, North, East, South) to generate diverse
traffic patterns. The extended experimental results for 6 intersections with 4
hours of simulation time imply that zone-based traffic pattern distributions
affect signal design selection. Although the static method works great for
evenly zone-based traffic distribution, the hybrid method works well for highly
weighted traffic at intersection pairs of the West-East and North-South zones.

Result: 在层次物种分类和层次检索任务中，RCME框架显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RCME框架有效提升了视觉语言模型对数据层次结构的建模能力，并在实验中验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Learning the hierarchical structure of data in vision-language models is a
significant challenge. Previous works have attempted to address this challenge
by employing entailment learning. However, these approaches fail to model the
transitive nature of entailment explicitly, which establishes the relationship
between order and semantics within a representation space. In this work, we
introduce Radial Cross-Modal Embeddings (RCME), a framework that enables the
explicit modeling of transitivity-enforced entailment. Our proposed framework
optimizes for the partial order of concepts within vision-language models. By
leveraging our framework, we develop a hierarchical vision-language foundation
model capable of representing the hierarchy in the Tree of Life. Our
experiments on hierarchical species classification and hierarchical retrieval
tasks demonstrate the enhanced performance of our models compared to the
existing state-of-the-art models. Our code and models are open-sourced at

Conclusion: TITAN通过有效处理伪标签噪声和域间差异，显著提升了无源域自适应目标检测的性能。

Abstract: We focus on the source-free domain adaptive object detection (SF-DAOD)
problem when source data is unavailable during adaptation and the model must
adapt to an unlabeled target domain. The majority of approaches for the problem
employ a self-supervised approach using a student-teacher (ST) framework where
pseudo-labels are generated via a source-pretrained model for further
fine-tuning. We observe that the performance of a student model often degrades
drastically, due to the collapse of the teacher model, primarily caused by high
noise in pseudo-labels, resulting from domain bias, discrepancies, and a
significant domain shift across domains. To obtain reliable pseudo-labels, we
propose a Target-based Iterative Query-Token Adversarial Network (TITAN), which
separates the target images into two subsets: those similar to the source
(easy) and those dissimilar (hard). We propose a strategy to estimate variance
to partition the target domain. This approach leverages the insight that higher
detection variances correspond to higher recall and greater similarity to the
source domain. Also, we incorporate query-token-based adversarial modules into
a student-teacher baseline framework to reduce the domain gaps between two
feature representations. Experiments conducted on four natural imaging datasets
and two challenging medical datasets have substantiated the superior
performance of TITAN compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA)
methodologies. We report an mAP improvement of +22.7, +22.2, +21.1, and +3.7
percent over the current SOTA on C2F, C2B, S2C, and K2C benchmarks,
respectively.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have set the state-of-the-art in computer vision tasks
such as bounding box detection and semantic segmentation. Object detectors and
segmentation models assign confidence scores to predictions, reflecting the
model's uncertainty in object detection or pixel-wise classification. However,
these confidence estimates are often miscalibrated, as their architectures and
loss functions are tailored to task performance rather than probabilistic
foundation. Even with well calibrated predictions, object detectors fail to
quantify uncertainty outside detected bounding boxes, i.e., the model does not
make a probability assessment of whether an area without detected objects is
truly free of obstacles. This poses a safety risk in applications such as
automated driving, where uncertainty in empty areas remains unexplored. In this
work, we propose an object detection model grounded in spatial statistics.
Bounding box data matches realizations of a marked point process, commonly used
to describe the probabilistic occurrence of spatial point events identified as
bounding box centers, where marks are used to describe the spatial extension of
bounding boxes and classes. Our statistical framework enables a
likelihood-based training and provides well-defined confidence estimates for
whether a region is drivable, i.e., free of objects. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method through calibration assessments and evaluation of
performance.

Motivation: 现有解码策略存在静态约束、效率低下和细节退化等问题，无法有效解决LVLM中的幻觉问题。

Result: 实验表明，DLC显著减少了幻觉，优于现有方法，同时保持了高效的推理速度。

Conclusion: DLC是一种高效且有效的解码时解决方案，提升了LVLM的可靠性。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated significant
advancements in multimodal understanding, yet they are frequently hampered by
hallucination-the generation of text that contradicts visual input. Existing
training-free decoding strategies exhibit critical limitations, including the
use of static constraints that do not adapt to semantic drift during
generation, inefficiency stemming from the need for multiple forward passes,
and degradation of detail due to overly rigid intervention rules. To overcome
these challenges, this paper introduces Dynamic Logits Calibration (DLC), a
novel training-free decoding framework designed to dynamically align text
generation with visual evidence at inference time. At the decoding phase, DLC
step-wise employs CLIP to assess the semantic alignment between the input image
and the generated text sequence. Then, the Relative Visual Advantage (RVA) of
candidate tokens is evaluated against a dynamically updated contextual
baseline, adaptively adjusting output logits to favor tokens that are visually
grounded. Furthermore, an adaptive weighting mechanism, informed by a real-time
context alignment score, carefully balances the visual guidance while ensuring
the overall quality of the textual output. Extensive experiments conducted
across diverse benchmarks and various LVLM architectures (such as LLaVA,
InstructBLIP, and MiniGPT-4) demonstrate that DLC significantly reduces
hallucinations, outperforming current methods while maintaining high inference
efficiency by avoiding multiple forward passes. Overall, we present an
effective and efficient decoding-time solution to mitigate hallucinations,
thereby enhancing the reliability of LVLMs for more practices. Code will be
released on Github.

Conclusion: GGTalker通过结合通用先验和身份适应，显著提升了语音驱动3D说话头部的生成质量和通用性。

Abstract: Creating high-quality, generalizable speech-driven 3D talking heads remains a
persistent challenge. Previous methods achieve satisfactory results for fixed
viewpoints and small-scale audio variations, but they struggle with large head
rotations and out-of-distribution (OOD) audio. Moreover, they are constrained
by the need for time-consuming, identity-specific training. We believe the core
issue lies in the lack of sufficient 3D priors, which limits the extrapolation
capabilities of synthesized talking heads. To address this, we propose
GGTalker, which synthesizes talking heads through a combination of
generalizable priors and identity-specific adaptation. We introduce a two-stage
Prior-Adaptation training strategy to learn Gaussian head priors and adapt to
individual characteristics. We train Audio-Expression and Expression-Visual
priors to capture the universal patterns of lip movements and the general
distribution of head textures. During the Customized Adaptation, individual
speaking styles and texture details are precisely modeled. Additionally, we
introduce a color MLP to generate fine-grained, motion-aligned textures and a
Body Inpainter to blend rendered results with the background, producing
indistinguishable, photorealistic video frames. Comprehensive experiments show
that GGTalker achieves state-of-the-art performance in rendering quality, 3D
consistency, lip-sync accuracy, and training efficiency.

Conclusion: G$^{2}$D有效解决了模态不平衡问题，提升了多模态学习的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal learning aims to leverage information from diverse data modalities
to achieve more comprehensive performance. However, conventional multimodal
models often suffer from modality imbalance, where one or a few modalities
dominate model optimization, leading to suboptimal feature representation and
underutilization of weak modalities. To address this challenge, we introduce
Gradient-Guided Distillation (G$^{2}$D), a knowledge distillation framework
that optimizes the multimodal model with a custom-built loss function that
fuses both unimodal and multimodal objectives. G$^{2}$D further incorporates a
dynamic sequential modality prioritization (SMP) technique in the learning
process to ensure each modality leads the learning process, avoiding the
pitfall of stronger modalities overshadowing weaker ones. We validate G$^{2}$D
on multiple real-world datasets and show that G$^{2}$D amplifies the
significance of weak modalities while training and outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in classification and regression tasks. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有场景重建方法难以支持显著改变或新颖驾驶场景的逼真合成，MADrive旨在扩展其能力。

Method: MADrive引入MAD-Cars数据集和检索模块，从记忆库中检索相似车辆，重建3D资产并集成到目标场景中。

Conclusion: MADrive通过记忆增强重建，显著提升了驾驶场景的逼真合成能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in scene reconstruction have pushed toward highly realistic
modeling of autonomous driving (AD) environments using 3D Gaussian splatting.
However, the resulting reconstructions remain closely tied to the original
observations and struggle to support photorealistic synthesis of significantly
altered or novel driving scenarios. This work introduces MADrive, a
memory-augmented reconstruction framework designed to extend the capabilities
of existing scene reconstruction methods by replacing observed vehicles with
visually similar 3D assets retrieved from a large-scale external memory bank.
Specifically, we release MAD-Cars, a curated dataset of ${\sim}70$K 360{\deg}
car videos captured in the wild and present a retrieval module that finds the
most similar car instances in the memory bank, reconstructs the corresponding
3D assets from video, and integrates them into the target scene through
orientation alignment and relighting. The resulting replacements provide
complete multi-view representations of vehicles in the scene, enabling
photorealistic synthesis of substantially altered configurations, as
demonstrated in our experiments. Project page:

TL;DR: WAFT是一种高效的光流方法，通过高分辨率变形替代成本体积，在降低内存消耗的同时提升准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战传统观念，即构建成本体积是实现高性能的必要条件。

Method: 使用高分辨率变形替代成本体积，设计简单灵活，依赖最小归纳偏差和自定义设计。

Result: 在Spring和KITTI基准测试中排名第一，KITTI零样本泛化表现最佳，速度比同类方法快4.1倍。

Conclusion: WAFT是一种简单高效的光流方法，性能优越且速度快。

Abstract: We introduce Warping-Alone Field Transforms (WAFT), a simple and effective
method for optical flow. WAFT is similar to RAFT but replaces cost volume with
high-resolution warping, achieving better accuracy with lower memory cost. This
design challenges the conventional wisdom that constructing cost volumes is
necessary for strong performance. WAFT is a simple and flexible
meta-architecture with minimal inductive biases and reliance on custom designs.
Compared with existing methods, WAFT ranks 1st on Spring and KITTI benchmarks,
achieves the best zero-shot generalization on KITTI, while being up to 4.1x
faster than methods with similar performance. Code and model weights are

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的跨模态图像-文本检索方法，通过最大化嵌入集之间的匹配相似性，并结合两种损失函数提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单向量嵌入方法难以捕捉跨模态的多样关联，而现有集合表示方法仍面临稀疏监督和集合坍缩问题。

Method: 提出Maximal Pair Assignment Similarity优化嵌入集间的一对一匹配，并引入Global Discriminative Loss和Intra-Set Divergence Loss增强表示。

Result: 在MS-COCO和Flickr30k数据集上实现了最先进的性能，无需外部数据。

Conclusion: 新方法有效解决了集合表示中的问题，提升了跨模态检索性能。

Abstract: Cross-modal image-text retrieval is challenging because of the diverse
possible associations between content from different modalities. Traditional
methods learn a single-vector embedding to represent semantics of each sample,
but struggle to capture nuanced and diverse relationships that can exist across
modalities. Set-based approaches, which represent each sample with multiple
embeddings, offer a promising alternative, as they can capture richer and more
diverse relationships. In this paper, we show that, despite their promise,
these set-based representations continue to face issues including sparse
supervision and set collapse, which limits their effectiveness. To address
these challenges, we propose Maximal Pair Assignment Similarity to optimize
one-to-one matching between embedding sets which preserve semantic diversity
within the set. We also introduce two loss functions to further enhance the
representations: Global Discriminative Loss to enhance distinction among
embeddings, and Intra-Set Divergence Loss to prevent collapse within each set.
Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on MS-COCO and Flickr30k
without relying on external data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StruMamba3D是一种自监督点云表示学习新方法，通过保留空间依赖性和改进状态空间模型（SSM）解决了现有Mamba方法的问题，并在多个下游任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Mamba方法在点云表示学习中破坏了3D点的邻接性，且无法保留长序列记忆，限制了SSM的潜力。

Method: 设计空间状态代理保留空间依赖，增强SSM的状态更新策略，引入轻量卷积促进空间状态交互，并采用序列长度自适应策略。

Result: 在四个下游任务中表现优异，ModelNet40准确率达95.1%，ScanObjectNN最困难分块达92.75%。

Conclusion: StruMamba3D通过改进SSM的空间和序列建模能力，显著提升了点云表示学习性能。

Abstract: Recently, Mamba-based methods have demonstrated impressive performance in
point cloud representation learning by leveraging State Space Model (SSM) with
the efficient context modeling ability and linear complexity. However, these
methods still face two key issues that limit the potential of SSM: Destroying
the adjacency of 3D points during SSM processing and failing to retain
long-sequence memory as the input length increases in downstream tasks. To
address these issues, we propose StruMamba3D, a novel paradigm for
self-supervised point cloud representation learning. It enjoys several merits.
First, we design spatial states and use them as proxies to preserve spatial
dependencies among points. Second, we enhance the SSM with a state-wise update
strategy and incorporate a lightweight convolution to facilitate interactions
between spatial states for efficient structure modeling. Third, our method
reduces the sensitivity of pre-trained Mamba-based models to varying input
lengths by introducing a sequence length-adaptive strategy. Experimental
results across four downstream tasks showcase the superior performance of our
method. In addition, our method attains the SOTA 95.1% accuracy on ModelNet40
and 92.75% accuracy on the most challenging split of ScanObjectNN without
voting strategy.

Motivation: 解决现有基于扩散的视图合成模型在遮挡情况下生成不一致视图的问题。

Method: 利用Pix2Gestalt数据集构建自监督训练流程，联合学习补全和多视角生成。

Result: 无需先验修复或手动标注，即可生成六种结构一致的新视角视图。

Conclusion: 提出了首个遮挡感知重建基准，为未来方法提供了标准化评估协议。

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D objects from a single image is a long-standing challenge,
especially under real-world occlusions. While recent diffusion-based view
synthesis models can generate consistent novel views from a single RGB image,
they generally assume fully visible inputs and fail when parts of the object
are occluded. This leads to inconsistent views and degraded 3D reconstruction
quality. To overcome this limitation, we propose an end-to-end framework for
occlusion-aware multi-view generation. Our method directly synthesizes six
structurally consistent novel views from a single partially occluded image,
enabling downstream 3D reconstruction without requiring prior inpainting or
manual annotations. We construct a self-supervised training pipeline using the
Pix2Gestalt dataset, leveraging occluded-unoccluded image pairs and
pseudo-ground-truth views to teach the model structure-aware completion and
view consistency. Without modifying the original architecture, we fully
fine-tune the view synthesis model to jointly learn completion and multi-view
generation. Additionally, we introduce the first benchmark for occlusion-aware
reconstruction, encompassing diverse occlusion levels, object categories, and
mask patterns. This benchmark provides a standardized protocol for evaluating
future methods under partial occlusions. Our code is available at

Conclusion: SiM3D为多视角3D ADS任务提供了首个基准，填补了从合成数据泛化到真实数据的空白。

Abstract: We propose SiM3D, the first benchmark considering the integration of
multiview and multimodal information for comprehensive 3D anomaly detection and
segmentation (ADS), where the task is to produce a voxel-based Anomaly Volume.
Moreover, SiM3D focuses on a scenario of high interest in manufacturing:
single-instance anomaly detection, where only one object, either real or
synthetic, is available for training. In this respect, SiM3D stands out as the
first ADS benchmark that addresses the challenge of generalising from synthetic
training data to real test data. SiM3D includes a novel multimodal multiview
dataset acquired using top-tier industrial sensors and robots. The dataset
features multiview high-resolution images (12 Mpx) and point clouds (7M points)
for 333 instances of eight types of objects, alongside a CAD model for each
type. We also provide manually annotated 3D segmentation GTs for anomalous test
samples. To establish reference baselines for the proposed multiview 3D ADS
task, we adapt prominent singleview methods and assess their performance using
novel metrics that operate on Anomaly Volumes.

Motivation: 现有联邦学习方法主要关注模型异构性和聚合技术，忽略了数据集大小特性对训练动态的根本影响。

Method: 提出SAFL框架，基于数据集大小特性组织联邦学习，并通过多模态数据集实验验证其有效性。

Result: 实验发现：1) 1000-1500样本为最优范围；2) 结构化数据表现优于非结构化数据；3) 大数据集性能下降。SAFL平均准确率87.68%，通信效率高。

Conclusion: SAFL填补了数据特性驱动联邦学习策略的空白，为实际部署提供了理论和实践指导。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a transformative paradigm for
distributed machine learning while preserving data privacy. However, existing
approaches predominantly focus on model heterogeneity and aggregation
techniques, largely overlooking the fundamental impact of dataset size
characteristics on federated training dynamics. This paper introduces
Size-Based Adaptive Federated Learning (SAFL), a novel progressive training
framework that systematically organizes federated learning based on dataset
size characteristics across heterogeneous multi-modal data. Our comprehensive
experimental evaluation across 13 diverse datasets spanning 7 modalities
(vision, text, time series, audio, sensor, medical vision, and multimodal)
reveals critical insights: 1) an optimal dataset size range of 1000-1500
samples for federated learning effectiveness; 2) a clear modality performance
hierarchy with structured data (time series, sensor) significantly
outperforming unstructured data (text, multimodal); and 3) systematic
performance degradation for large datasets exceeding 2000 samples. SAFL
achieves an average accuracy of 87.68% across all datasets, with structured
data modalities reaching 99%+ accuracy. The framework demonstrates superior
communication efficiency, reducing total data transfer to 7.38 GB across 558
communications while maintaining high performance. Our real-time monitoring
framework provides unprecedented insights into system resource utilization,
network efficiency, and training dynamics. This work fills critical gaps in
understanding how data characteristics should drive federated learning
strategies, providing both theoretical insights and practical guidance for
real-world FL deployments in neural network and learning systems.

Conclusion: E-ABIN是一个通用且可解释的框架，适用于生物网络中的异常检测，具有高准确性和用户友好性。

Abstract: The increasing availability of large-scale omics data calls for robust
analytical frameworks capable of handling complex gene expression datasets
while offering interpretable results. Recent advances in artificial
intelligence have enabled the identification of aberrant molecular patterns
distinguishing disease states from healthy controls. Coupled with improvements
in model interpretability, these tools now support the identification of genes
potentially driving disease phenotypes. However, current approaches to gene
anomaly detection often remain limited to single datasets and lack accessible
graphical interfaces. Here, we introduce E-ABIN, a general-purpose, explainable
framework for Anomaly detection in Biological Networks. E-ABIN combines
classical machine learning and graph-based deep learning techniques within a
unified, user-friendly platform, enabling the detection and interpretation of
anomalies from gene expression or methylation-derived networks. By integrating
algorithms such as Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, Graph Autoencoders
(GAEs), and Graph Adversarial Attributed Networks (GAANs), E-ABIN ensures a
high predictive accuracy while maintaining interpretability. We demonstrate the
utility of E-ABIN through case studies of bladder cancer and coeliac disease,
where it effectively uncovers biologically relevant anomalies and offers
insights into disease mechanisms.

Motivation: 研究动机是探索大脑和机器如何通过结构-特异性对齐最小化不确定性，从而统一理解推理过程。

Method: 方法包括构建分层计算框架，从基础熵最小化到四层操作原则（核心推理约束、资源分配、时间引导动态和空间层次组合），并通过形式等价定理和模拟验证。

Result: 结果表明，CCUP对齐的推理能显著提升效率，并通过依赖关系和模拟验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 结论是CCUP为大脑和机器的推理提供了统一的理论基础，强调通过内容引导的模拟对齐结构与特异性。

Abstract: The Context-Content Uncertainty Principle (CCUP) proposes that inference
under uncertainty is governed by an entropy asymmetry between context and
content: high-entropy contexts must be interpreted through alignment with
low-entropy, structured content. In this paper, we develop a layered
computational framework that derives operational principles from this
foundational asymmetry. At the base level, CCUP formalizes inference as
directional entropy minimization, establishing a variational gradient that
favors content-first structuring. Building upon this, we identify four
hierarchical layers of operational principles: (\textbf{L1}) \emph{Core
Inference Constraints}, including structure-before-specificity, asymmetric
inference flow, cycle-consistent bootstrapping, and conditional compression,
all shown to be mutually reducible; (\textbf{L2}) \emph{Resource Allocation
Principles}, such as precision-weighted attention, asymmetric learning rates,
and attractor-based memory encoding; (\textbf{L3}) \emph{Temporal Bootstrapping
Dynamics}, which organize learning over time via structure-guided curricula;
and (\textbf{L4}) \emph{Spatial Hierarchical Composition}, which integrates
these mechanisms into self-organizing cycles of memory, inference, and
planning. We present formal equivalence theorems, a dependency lattice among
principles, and computational simulations demonstrating the efficiency gains of
CCUP-aligned inference. This work provides a unified theoretical foundation for
understanding how brains and machines minimize uncertainty through recursive
structure-specificity alignment. The brain is not just an inference machine. It
is a cycle-consistent entropy gradient resolver, aligning structure and
specificity via path-dependent, content-seeded simulation.

Motivation: 现有方法在高噪声水平下估计不准确且未重用历史信息，导致计算效率低下。

Method: 将推理时间对齐视为搜索问题，通过树结构传播终端奖励并迭代优化值估计。

Result: 在MNIST和CIFAR-10上，DTS以10倍更少的计算达到最佳基线FID；在文本生成和语言任务中，DTS*以5倍更少的计算匹配最佳样本。

Conclusion: DTS和DTS*通过重用信息提供了一种可扩展的推理时间对齐方法，将额外计算转化为更好的样本质量。

Abstract: Adapting a pretrained diffusion model to new objectives at inference time
remains an open problem in generative modeling. Existing steering methods
suffer from inaccurate value estimation, especially at high noise levels, which
biases guidance. Moreover, information from past runs is not reused to improve
sample quality, resulting in inefficient use of compute. Inspired by the
success of Monte Carlo Tree Search, we address these limitations by casting
inference-time alignment as a search problem that reuses past computations. We
introduce a tree-based approach that samples from the reward-aligned target
density by propagating terminal rewards back through the diffusion chain and
iteratively refining value estimates with each additional generation. Our
proposed method, Diffusion Tree Sampling (DTS), produces asymptotically exact
samples from the target distribution in the limit of infinite rollouts, and its
greedy variant, Diffusion Tree Search (DTS$^\star$), performs a global search
for high reward samples. On MNIST and CIFAR-10 class-conditional generation,
DTS matches the FID of the best-performing baseline with up to $10\times$ less
compute. In text-to-image generation and language completion tasks, DTS$^\star$
effectively searches for high reward samples that match best-of-N with up to
$5\times$ less compute. By reusing information from previous generations, we
get an anytime algorithm that turns additional compute into steadily better
samples, providing a scalable approach for inference-time alignment of
diffusion models.

TL;DR: 论文证明了FLIPD方法在现实假设下的正确性，并扩展了其适用范围到均匀卷积。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型（DMs）在生成模型中表现优异，但FLIPD方法的理论基础仅在不现实的仿射子流形假设下成立，需填补这一理论空白。

Method: 通过理论分析，证明FLIPD在现实假设下的正确性，并探讨其在均匀卷积下的适用性。

Result: FLIPD在现实条件下仍能准确估计局部内在维度（LID），且适用于均匀卷积。

Conclusion: 研究填补了FLIPD的理论空白，扩展了其应用范围，为LID估计提供了更坚实的理论基础。

Abstract: The manifold hypothesis asserts that data of interest in high-dimensional
ambient spaces, such as image data, lies on unknown low-dimensional
submanifolds. Diffusion models (DMs) -- which operate by convolving data with
progressively larger amounts of Gaussian noise and then learning to revert this
process -- have risen to prominence as the most performant generative models,
and are known to be able to learn distributions with low-dimensional support.
For a given datum in one of these submanifolds, we should thus intuitively
expect DMs to have implicitly learned its corresponding local intrinsic
dimension (LID), i.e. the dimension of the submanifold it belongs to. Kamkari
et al. (2024b) recently showed that this is indeed the case by linking this LID
to the rate of change of the log marginal densities of the DM with respect to
the amount of added noise, resulting in an LID estimator known as FLIPD. LID
estimators such as FLIPD have a plethora of uses, among others they quantify
the complexity of a given datum, and can be used to detect outliers,
adversarial examples and AI-generated text. FLIPD achieves state-of-the-art
performance at LID estimation, yet its theoretical underpinnings are incomplete
since Kamkari et al. (2024b) only proved its correctness under the highly
unrealistic assumption of affine submanifolds. In this work we bridge this gap
by formally proving the correctness of FLIPD under realistic assumptions.
Additionally, we show that an analogous result holds when Gaussian convolutions
are replaced with uniform ones, and discuss the relevance of this result.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in complex

comparably low cost. Many of these methods have been developed and evaluated on
mathematical reasoning benchmarks such as AIME. This paper investigates whether
the lessons learned from these benchmarks generalize to the domain of advanced

the TPBench physics dataset and compare their effectiveness with results on
AIME. To better leverage the structure of physics problems, we develop a novel,
symbolic weak-verifier framework to improve parallel scaling results. Our
empirical results demonstrate that this method significantly outperforms
existing test-time scaling approaches on TPBench. We also evaluate our method
on AIME, confirming its effectiveness in solving advanced mathematical
problems. Our findings highlight the power of step-wise symbolic verification
for tackling complex scientific problems.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are catalyzing a transformative shift in materials
science (MatSci) by enabling scalable, general-purpose, and multimodal AI
systems for scientific discovery. Unlike traditional machine learning models,
which are typically narrow in scope and require task-specific engineering, FMs
offer cross-domain generalization and exhibit emergent capabilities. Their
versatility is especially well-suited to materials science, where research
challenges span diverse data types and scales. This survey provides a
comprehensive overview of foundation models, agentic systems, datasets, and
computational tools supporting this growing field. We introduce a task-driven
taxonomy encompassing six broad application areas: data extraction,
interpretation and Q\&A; atomistic simulation; property prediction; materials
structure, design and discovery; process planning, discovery, and optimization;
and multiscale modeling. We discuss recent advances in both unimodal and
multimodal FMs, as well as emerging large language model (LLM) agents.
Furthermore, we review standardized datasets, open-source tools, and autonomous
experimental platforms that collectively fuel the development and integration
of FMs into research workflows. We assess the early successes of foundation
models and identify persistent limitations, including challenges in
generalizability, interpretability, data imbalance, safety concerns, and
limited multimodal fusion. Finally, we articulate future research directions
centered on scalable pretraining, continual learning, data governance, and
trustworthiness.

Motivation: 探究微调后LLM中关系信息的存储位置和提取机制，现有方法（如激活修补）可能破坏信息，需新方法填补空白。

Method: 采用动态权重嫁接技术，对比微调与预训练模型的权重变化，分析信息提取与召回路径。

Result: 发现信息通过提取和召回两种路径处理，部分任务需双路径，部分仅需单一路径；召回路径涉及特定注意力机制和关系提取步骤。

Conclusion: 微调后的LLM通过提取和召回路径处理关系信息，任务需求决定路径选择，召回路径集中在最后几层。

Abstract: When an LLM learns a relation during finetuning (e.g., new movie releases,
corporate mergers, etc.), where does this information go? Is it extracted when
the model processes an entity, recalled just-in-time before a prediction, or
are there multiple separate heuristics? Existing localization approaches (e.g.
activation patching) are ill-suited for this analysis because they tend to
replace parts of the residual stream, potentially deleting information. To fill
this gap, we propose dynamic weight-grafting between fine-tuned and pre-trained
language models to show that fine-tuned language models both (1) extract
relation information learned during finetuning while processing entities and
(2) ``recall" this information in later layers while generating predictions. In
some cases, models need both of these pathways to correctly generate finetuned
information while, in other cases, a single ``enrichment" or ``recall" pathway
alone is sufficient. We examine the necessity and sufficiency of these
information pathways, examining what layers they occur at, how much redundancy
they exhibit, and which model components are involved -- finding that the
``recall" pathway occurs via both task-specific attention mechanisms and a
relation extraction step in the output of the attention and the feedforward
networks at the final layers before next token prediction.

Abstract: Training large language models is an expensive, compute-bound process that
must be repeated as models scale, algorithms improve, and new data is
collected. To address this, next-generation hardware accelerators increasingly
support lower-precision arithmetic formats, such as the Microscaling (MX)
formats introduced in NVIDIA's Blackwell architecture. These formats use a
shared scale within blocks of parameters to extend representable range and
perform forward/backward GEMM operations in reduced precision for efficiency
gains. In this work, we investigate the challenges and viability of
block-scaled precision formats during model training. Across nearly one
thousand language models trained from scratch -- spanning compute budgets from
$2 \times 10^{17}$ to $4.8 \times 10^{19}$ FLOPs and sweeping over a broad
range of weight-activation precision combinations -- we consistently observe
that training in MX formats exhibits sharp, stochastic instabilities in the
loss, particularly at larger compute scales. To explain this phenomenon, we
conduct controlled experiments and ablations on a smaller proxy model that
exhibits similar behavior as the language model, sweeping across architectural
settings, hyperparameters, and precision formats. These experiments motivate a
simple model in which multiplicative gradient bias introduced by the
quantization of layer-norm affine parameters and a small fraction of
activations can trigger runaway divergence. Through \emph{in situ} intervention
experiments on our proxy model, we demonstrate that instabilities can be
averted or delayed by modifying precision schemes mid-training. Guided by these
findings, we evaluate stabilization strategies in the LLM setting and show that
certain hybrid configurations recover performance competitive with
full-precision training. We release our code at

*Xinghao Dong,Huchen Yang,Jin-Long Wu*

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于潜在分数的生成AI框架，用于学习非线性动力学系统中的随机非局部闭合模型和本构关系，显著降低了计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂多尺度动力学系统中缺乏明确尺度分离的问题，传统方法的局部确定性假设限制了其适用性。

Method: 联合训练卷积自编码器和条件扩散模型，在潜在空间中降低采样维度，同时保留物理特性。

Result: 潜在空间中的扩散模型在保持预测精度的同时，显著加速了计算。

Conclusion: 潜在条件扩散模型框架为工程湍流等应用提供了高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a latent score-based generative AI framework for learning
stochastic, non-local closure models and constitutive laws in nonlinear
dynamical systems of computational mechanics. This work addresses a key
challenge of modeling complex multiscale dynamical systems without a clear
scale separation, for which numerically resolving all scales is prohibitively
expensive, e.g., for engineering turbulent flows. While classical closure
modeling methods leverage domain knowledge to approximate subgrid-scale
phenomena, their deterministic and local assumptions can be too restrictive in
regimes lacking a clear scale separation. Recent developments of
diffusion-based stochastic models have shown promise in the context of closure
modeling, but their prohibitive computational inference cost limits practical
applications for many real-world applications. This work addresses this
limitation by jointly training convolutional autoencoders with conditional
diffusion models in the latent spaces, significantly reducing the
dimensionality of the sampling process while preserving essential physical
characteristics. Numerical results demonstrate that the joint training approach
helps discover a proper latent space that not only guarantees small
reconstruction errors but also ensures good performance of the diffusion model
in the latent space. When integrated into numerical simulations, the proposed
stochastic modeling framework via latent conditional diffusion models achieves
significant computational acceleration while maintaining comparable predictive
accuracy to standard diffusion models in physical spaces.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为随机参数分解（SPD）的新方法，用于更高效地分解神经网络参数，解决了现有方法（如APD）的计算成本高和超参数敏感性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前主流的参数分解方法（APD）存在计算成本高和超参数敏感性问题，限制了其在更大、更复杂模型中的应用。

Method: 提出随机参数分解（SPD），通过改进算法使其更具可扩展性和鲁棒性。

Result: SPD在更大、更复杂的模型上表现优于APD，避免了参数收缩问题，并在玩具模型中更准确地识别真实机制。

Conclusion: SPD为机制可解释性研究提供了新方向，并开源了相关实验库。

Abstract: A key step in reverse engineering neural networks is to decompose them into
simpler parts that can be studied in relative isolation. Linear parameter
decomposition -- a framework that has been proposed to resolve several issues
with current decomposition methods -- decomposes neural network parameters into
a sum of sparsely used vectors in parameter space. However, the current main
method in this framework, Attribution-based Parameter Decomposition (APD), is
impractical on account of its computational cost and sensitivity to
hyperparameters. In this work, we introduce \textit{Stochastic Parameter
Decomposition} (SPD), a method that is more scalable and robust to
hyperparameters than APD, which we demonstrate by decomposing models that are
slightly larger and more complex than was possible to decompose with APD. We
also show that SPD avoids other issues, such as shrinkage of the learned
parameters, and better identifies ground truth mechanisms in toy models. By
bridging causal mediation analysis and network decomposition methods, this
demonstration opens up new research possibilities in mechanistic
interpretability by removing barriers to scaling linear parameter decomposition
methods to larger models. We release a library for running SPD and reproducing
our experiments at https://github.com/goodfire-ai/spd.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 优化GPU内核通常需要深厚的架构知识和大量实验，而在新架构上更困难。本文旨在通过LLM驱动的自动化方法解决这一问题。

Method: 采用多阶段进化过程：选择代码版本、生成优化假设、自动实验实现，并利用外部评估系统反馈。

Result: 由于性能竞赛结果未公开，论文主要展示了架构设计和工作流程，强调LLM在优化中的潜力。

Conclusion: LLM驱动的自动化方法有望在资源受限或快速发展的硬件环境中加速GPU内核优化。

Abstract: Optimizing GPU kernels for high performance is a complex task, often
demanding deep architectural knowledge, extensive profiling, and iterative
experimentation. This challenge is amplified when targeting newer or
less-documented GPU architectures where traditional development aids are
scarce. This paper introduces an LLM-powered "GPU Kernel Scientist," an
automated methodology for iteratively refining accelerator kernels.
  Our methodology employs LLMs in a multi-stage, evolutionary process: (a)
strategically selecting promising prior code versions as a basis for new
iterations; (b) generating hypotheses for optimization experiments, based on
existing code and assimilated knowledge from general GPU literature; and (c)
autonomously implementing these experiments through code modification and
subsequent submission to an external evaluation system, using only observed
timing data as performance feedback. We detail how this approach navigates the
challenges of the AMD MI300 target architecture and leverages LLMs to
compensate for limited domain-specific human expertise.
  Since quantitative results from an ongoing performance competition were
embargoed on paper submission date, we present the architectural design,
operational workflow, and qualitative insights, highlighting the potential of
LLM-driven agents to democratise and accelerate GPU kernel optimization,
especially in resource-constrained or rapidly evolving hardware environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的FPGA工具主要针对前馈网络，LSTM加速需要完全定制实现，限制了其在资源受限环境中的实时部署。

Method: 利用FINN框架和ONNX的Scan算子建模LSTM计算，引入自定义变换将量化计算图映射到硬件块。

Result: 生成的量化ConvLSTM加速器在性能和资源消耗上取得平衡，同时保持或超越现有模型的推理精度。

Conclusion: 提出的通用流程为FPGA上资源高效的RNN加速器设计铺平了道路。

Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), particularly LSTMs, are effective for
time-series tasks like sentiment analysis and short-term stock prediction.
However, their computational complexity poses challenges for real-time
deployment in resource constrained environments. While FPGAs offer a promising
platform for energy-efficient AI acceleration, existing tools mainly target
feed-forward networks, and LSTM acceleration typically requires full custom
implementation. In this paper, we address this gap by leveraging the
open-source and extensible FINN framework to enable the generalized deployment
of LSTMs on FPGAs. Specifically, we leverage the Scan operator from the Open
Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) specification to model the recurrent nature of
LSTM computations, enabling support for mixed quantisation within them and
functional verification of LSTM-based models. Furthermore, we introduce custom
transformations within the FINN compiler to map the quantised ONNX computation
graph to hardware blocks from the HLS kernel library of the FINN compiler and
Vitis HLS. We validate the proposed tool-flow by training a quantised ConvLSTM
model for a mid-price stock prediction task using the widely used dataset and
generating a corresponding hardware IP of the model using our flow, targeting
the XCZU7EV device. We show that the generated quantised ConvLSTM accelerator
through our flow achieves a balance between performance (latency) and resource
consumption, while matching (or bettering) inference accuracy of
state-of-the-art models with reduced precision. We believe that the
generalisable nature of the proposed flow will pave the way for
resource-efficient RNN accelerator designs on FPGAs.

Result: 在OpenML-CC18和Tabzilla基准测试中，Hellsemble通常优于传统集成方法。

Conclusion: 基于实例难度构建集成系统是高效且鲁棒的方向。

Abstract: Ensemble learning has proven effective in boosting predictive performance,
but traditional methods such as bagging, boosting, and dynamic ensemble
selection (DES) suffer from high computational cost and limited adaptability to
heterogeneous data distributions. To address these limitations, we propose
Hellsemble, a novel and interpretable ensemble framework for binary
classification that leverages dataset complexity during both training and
inference. Hellsemble incrementally partitions the dataset into circles of
difficulty by iteratively passing misclassified instances from simpler models
to subsequent ones, forming a committee of specialised base learners. Each
model is trained on increasingly challenging subsets, while a separate router
model learns to assign new instances to the most suitable base model based on
inferred difficulty. Hellsemble achieves strong classification accuracy while
maintaining computational efficiency and interpretability. Experimental results
on OpenML-CC18 and Tabzilla benchmarks demonstrate that Hellsemble often
outperforms classical ensemble methods. Our findings suggest that embracing
instance-level difficulty offers a promising direction for constructing
efficient and robust ensemble systems.

Result: 实验证明该方法高效、适用于实时处理，且兼容多种DNN架构和领域。

Conclusion: 该方法在对抗样本检测中表现出色，具有广泛适用性和实用性。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are notoriously vulnerable to adversarial input
designs with limited noise budgets. While numerous successful attacks with
subtle modifications to original input have been proposed, defense techniques
against these attacks are relatively understudied. Existing defense approaches
either focus on improving DNN robustness by negating the effects of
perturbations or use a secondary model to detect adversarial data. Although
equally important, the attack detection approach, which is studied in this
work, provides a more practical defense compared to the robustness approach. We
show that the existing detection methods are either ineffective against the
state-of-the-art attack techniques or computationally inefficient for real-time
processing. We propose a novel universal and efficient method to detect
adversarial examples by analyzing the varying degrees of impact of attacks on
different DNN layers. {Our method trains a lightweight regression model that
predicts deeper-layer features from early-layer features, and uses the
prediction error to detect adversarial samples.} Through theoretical arguments
and extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our detection method is highly
effective, computationally efficient for real-time processing, compatible with
any DNN architecture, and applicable across different domains, such as image,
video, and audio.

Motivation: 现有分布式GNN框架主要针对节点分类优化，链接预测性能未被充分研究，尤其是在子图分区训练时性能下降的问题。

Method: 通过分析性能下降的原因（信息丢失和负采样方式），提出SpLPG方法，利用图稀疏化减少通信成本。

Result: 实验表明，SpLPG在多个数据集上减少通信开销约80%，同时基本保持链接预测准确性。

Conclusion: SpLPG有效解决了分布式GNN在链接预测中的性能问题，平衡了通信成本和准确性。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for solving graph-related
problems. Distributed GNN frameworks and systems enhance the scalability of
GNNs and accelerate model training, yet most are optimized for node
classification. Their performance on link prediction remains underexplored.
This paper demystifies distributed training of GNNs for link prediction by
investigating the issue of performance degradation when each worker trains a
GNN on its assigned partitioned subgraph without having access to the entire
graph. We discover that the main sources of the issue come from not only the
information loss caused by graph partitioning but also the ways of drawing
negative samples during model training. While sharing the complete graph
information with each worker resolves the issue and preserves link prediction
accuracy, it incurs a high communication cost. We propose SpLPG, which
effectively leverages graph sparsification to mitigate the issue of performance
degradation at a reduced communication cost. Experiment results on several
public real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SpLPG, which
reduces the communication overhead by up to about 80% while mostly preserving
link prediction accuracy.

Abstract: The time allocation problem in multi-function cognitive radar systems focuses
on the trade-off between scanning for newly emerging targets and tracking the

optimization problem and employ deep reinforcement learning to find
Pareto-optimal solutions and compare deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)
and soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithms. Our results demonstrate the
effectiveness of both algorithms in adapting to various scenarios, with SAC
showing improved stability and sample efficiency compared to DDPG. We further
employ the NSGA-II algorithm to estimate an upper bound on the Pareto front of
the considered problem. This work contributes to the development of more
efficient and adaptive cognitive radar systems capable of balancing multiple
competing objectives in dynamic environments.

Method: 通过基于相似性的记忆度量，比较LoRA微调与全微调的记忆风险。

Result: LoRA微调显著减少记忆风险，同时保持任务性能。

Conclusion: LoRA微调是降低记忆风险的有效方法，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Memorization in large language models (LLMs) makes them vulnerable to data
extraction attacks. While pre-training memorization has been extensively
studied, fewer works have explored its impact in fine-tuning, particularly for
LoRA fine-tuning, a widely adopted parameter-efficient method.
  In this work, we re-examine memorization in fine-tuning and uncover a
surprising divergence from prior findings across different fine-tuning
strategies. Factors such as model scale and data duplication, which strongly
influence memorization in pre-training and full fine-tuning, do not follow the
same trend in LoRA fine-tuning. Using a more relaxed similarity-based
memorization metric, we demonstrate that LoRA significantly reduces
memorization risks compared to full fine-tuning, while still maintaining strong
task performance.

Abstract: In recent years, the rapid advancement of deep neural networks (DNNs) has

Omniwise, the first end-to-end, self-supervised fine-tuning pipeline that
applies large language models (LLMs) to GPU kernel performance prediction--a
novel use case in performance profiling. Omniwise is model-agnostic and
lightweight, achieving strong results even with a small 3B-parameter model. It
can predict key performance metrics, including memory bandwidth, cache hit
rates, GFLOPs, and arithmetic intensity, directly from kernel code without the
need for code execution or profiling tools. Our approach achieves over 90% of
predictions within 10% relative error on GPU kernels executed on AMD MI250 and

Conclusion: RWFT是一种高效且安全的遗忘方法，能够在不完全重新训练的情况下实现与完全重新训练相当的效果。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce an output-reweighting unlearning method, RWFT, a
lightweight technique that erases an entire class from a trained classifier
without full retraining. Forgetting specific classes from trained models is
essential for enforcing user deletion rights and mitigating harmful or biased
predictions. The full retraining is costly and existing unlearning methods fail
to replicate the behavior of the retrained models when predicting samples from
the unlearned class. We prove this failure by designing a variant of membership
inference attacks, MIA-NN that successfully reveals the unlearned class for any
of these methods. We propose a simple redistribution of the probability mass
for the prediction on the samples in the forgotten class which is robust to
MIA-NN. We also introduce a new metric based on the total variation (TV)
distance of the prediction probabilities to quantify residual leakage to
prevent future methods from susceptibility to the new attack. Through extensive
experiments with state of the art baselines in machine unlearning, we show that
our approach matches the results of full retraining in both metrics used for
evaluation by prior work and the new metric we propose in this work. Compare to
state-of-the-art methods, we gain 2.79% in previously used metrics and 111.45%
in our new TV-based metric over the best existing method.

Result: 算法确保有效覆盖并实现次线性遗憾，实验证明其能生成更小的预测集且优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 所提方法在多模型在线共形预测中显著提升了效率和性能。

Abstract: Online conformal prediction has demonstrated its capability to construct a
prediction set for each incoming data point that covers the true label with a
predetermined probability. To cope with potential distribution shift,
multi-model online conformal prediction has been introduced to select and
leverage different models from a preselected candidate set. Along with the
improved flexibility, the choice of the preselected set also brings challenges.
A candidate set that includes a large number of models may increase the
computational complexity. In addition, the inclusion of irrelevant models with
poor performance may negatively impact the performance and lead to
unnecessarily large prediction sets. To address these challenges, we propose a
novel multi-model online conformal prediction algorithm that identifies a
subset of effective models at each time step by collecting feedback from a
bipartite graph, which is refined upon receiving new data. A model is then
selected from this subset to construct the prediction set, resulting in reduced
computational complexity and smaller prediction sets. Additionally, we
demonstrate that using prediction set size as feedback, alongside model loss,
can significantly improve efficiency by constructing smaller prediction sets
while still satisfying the required coverage guarantee. The proposed algorithms
are proven to ensure valid coverage and achieve sublinear regret. Experiments
on real and synthetic datasets validate that the proposed methods construct
smaller prediction sets and outperform existing multi-model online conformal
prediction approaches.

Motivation: 现有工作在单策略数据覆盖假设下提供性能保证，但使用了所有策略统一的复杂性度量（如均匀混合时间），这限制了理论分析的适用范围。

Method: 提出了一种基于悲观折扣值迭代的算法，结合新颖的分位数裁剪技术，使用更尖锐的基于经验跨度的惩罚函数。

Result: 首次实现了完全单策略样本复杂度界限，并处理了一般弱通信MDP，同时无需任何先验参数知识。

Conclusion: 研究表明，学习需要超越目标策略稳态分布的覆盖假设，区分了单策略复杂性度量与以往情况的不同，并提供了与主要结果接近的下界。

Abstract: We study offline reinforcement learning in average-reward MDPs, which
presents increased challenges from the perspectives of distribution shift and
non-uniform coverage, and has been relatively underexamined from a theoretical
perspective. While previous work obtains performance guarantees under
single-policy data coverage assumptions, such guarantees utilize additional
complexity measures which are uniform over all policies, such as the uniform
mixing time. We develop sharp guarantees depending only on the target policy,
specifically the bias span and a novel policy hitting radius, yielding the
first fully single-policy sample complexity bound for average-reward offline
RL. We are also the first to handle general weakly communicating MDPs,
contrasting restrictive structural assumptions made in prior work. To achieve
this, we introduce an algorithm based on pessimistic discounted value iteration
enhanced by a novel quantile clipping technique, which enables the use of a
sharper empirical-span-based penalty function. Our algorithm also does not
require any prior parameter knowledge for its implementation. Remarkably, we
show via hard examples that learning under our conditions requires coverage
assumptions beyond the stationary distribution of the target policy,
distinguishing single-policy complexity measures from previously examined
cases. We also develop lower bounds nearly matching our main result.

Conclusion: DL-LIME是一种有效的改进方法，提升了可解释性和任务性能，适用于雷达资源管理等复杂决策场景。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning has been extensively studied in decision-making
processes and has demonstrated superior performance over conventional
approaches in various fields, including radar resource management (RRM).
However, a notable limitation of neural networks is their ``black box" nature
and recent research work has increasingly focused on explainable AI (XAI)
techniques to describe the rationale behind neural network decisions. One
promising XAI method is local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME).
However, the sampling process in LIME ignores the correlations between
features. In this paper, we propose a modified LIME approach that integrates
deep learning (DL) into the sampling process, which we refer to as DL-LIME. We
employ DL-LIME within deep reinforcement learning for radar resource
management. Numerical results show that DL-LIME outperforms conventional LIME
in terms of both fidelity and task performance, demonstrating superior
performance with both metrics. DL-LIME also provides insights on which factors
are more important in decision making for radar resource management.

Abstract: Chemical process optimization is crucial to maximize production efficiency
and economic performance. Traditional methods, including gradient-based
solvers, evolutionary algorithms, and parameter grid searches, become
impractical when operating constraints are ill-defined or unavailable,
requiring engineers to rely on subjective heuristics to estimate feasible
parameter ranges. To address this constraint definition bottleneck, we present
a multi-agent framework of large language model (LLM) agents that autonomously
infer operating constraints from minimal process descriptions, then
collaboratively guide optimization using the inferred constraints. Our
AutoGen-based agentic framework employs OpenAI's o3 model, with specialized
agents for constraint generation, parameter validation, simulation execution,
and optimization guidance. Through two phases - autonomous constraint
generation using embedded domain knowledge, followed by iterative multi-agent
optimization - the framework eliminates the need for predefined operational
bounds. Validated on the hydrodealkylation process across cost, yield, and
yield-to-cost ratio metrics, the framework demonstrated competitive performance
with conventional optimization methods while achieving better computational
efficiency, requiring fewer iterations to converge. Our approach converged in
under 20 minutes, achieving a 31-fold speedup over grid search. Beyond
computational efficiency, the framework's reasoning-guided search demonstrates
sophisticated process understanding, correctly identifying utility trade-offs,
and applying domain-informed heuristics. This approach shows significant
potential for optimization scenarios where operational constraints are poorly
characterized or unavailable, particularly for emerging processes and retrofit
applications.

Motivation: 传统符号规则集成依赖轴平行决策区域，需要精心设计的特征才能达到高精度，否则需增加规则复杂度，降低可解释性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在保持测试风险与现有方法相当的同时，显著降低了模型复杂度。

Conclusion: 新方法在提升模型表达能力和保持可解释性之间取得了平衡。

Abstract: Small additive ensembles of symbolic rules offer interpretable prediction
models. Traditionally, these ensembles use rule conditions based on
conjunctions of simple threshold propositions $x \geq t$ on a single input
variable $x$ and threshold $t$, resulting geometrically in axis-parallel
polytopes as decision regions. While this form ensures a high degree of
interpretability for individual rules and can be learned efficiently using the
gradient boosting approach, it relies on having access to a curated set of
expressive and ideally independent input features so that a small ensemble of
axis-parallel regions can describe the target variable well. Absent such
features, reaching sufficient accuracy requires increasing the number and
complexity of individual rules, which diminishes the interpretability of the
model. Here, we extend classical rule ensembles by introducing logical
propositions with learnable sparse linear transformations of input variables,
i.e., propositions of the form $\mathbf{x}^\mathrm{T}\mathbf{w} \geq t$, where
$\mathbf{w}$ is a learnable sparse weight vector, enabling decision regions as
general polytopes with oblique faces. We propose a learning method using
sequential greedy optimization based on an iteratively reweighted formulation
of logistic regression. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
method efficiently constructs rule ensembles with the same test risk as
state-of-the-art methods while significantly reducing model complexity across
ten benchmark datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模语言模型训练数据可能包含隐私、版权或低质量内容，完全重新训练成本过高，需要高效遗忘算法。

Method: 提出MSA算法，利用模型检查点估计和消除特定数据点的影响。

Result: 实验表明MSA在多个基准、模型和评估指标上优于现有算法。

Conclusion: MSA为大型语言模型提供了高效的数据遗忘能力。

Abstract: Large language models are trained on massive corpora of web data, which may
include private data, copyrighted material, factually inaccurate data, or data
that degrades model performance. Eliminating the influence of such problematic
datapoints through complete retraining -- by repeatedly pretraining the model
on datasets that exclude these specific instances -- is computationally
prohibitive. For this reason, unlearning algorithms have emerged that aim to
eliminate the influence of particular datapoints, while otherwise preserving
the model -- at a low computational cost. However, precisely estimating and
undoing the influence of individual datapoints has proved to be challenging. In
this work, we propose a new algorithm, MSA, for estimating and undoing the
influence of datapoints -- by leveraging model checkpoints i.e. artifacts
capturing model states at different stages of pretraining. Our experimental
results demonstrate that MSA consistently outperforms existing machine
unlearning algorithms across multiple benchmarks, models, and evaluation
metrics, suggesting that MSA could be an effective approach towards more
flexible large language models that are capable of data erasure.

Result: 在SAbDab数据库中，氨基酸恢复率提高10.13%，关键CDR-H3区域的均方根偏差减少0.062Å。

Conclusion: AbMEGD在保持结构完整性的同时提升了功能性能，为抗体设计设立了新标准。

Abstract: Antibody design remains a critical challenge in therapeutic and diagnostic
development, particularly for complex antigens with diverse binding interfaces.
Current computational methods face two main limitations: (1) capturing
geometric features while preserving symmetries, and (2) generalizing novel
antigen interfaces. Despite recent advancements, these methods often fail to
accurately capture molecular interactions and maintain structural integrity. To
address these challenges, we propose \textbf{AbMEGD}, an end-to-end framework
integrating \textbf{M}ulti-scale \textbf{E}quivariant \textbf{G}raph
\textbf{D}iffusion for antibody sequence and structure co-design. Leveraging
advanced geometric deep learning, AbMEGD combines atomic-level geometric
features with residue-level embeddings, capturing local atomic details and
global sequence-structure interactions. Its E(3)-equivariant diffusion method
ensures geometric precision, computational efficiency, and robust
generalizability for complex antigens. Furthermore, experiments using the
SAbDab database demonstrate a 10.13\% increase in amino acid recovery, 3.32\%
rise in improvement percentage, and a 0.062~\AA\ reduction in root mean square
deviation within the critical CDR-H3 region compared to DiffAb, a leading
antibody design model. These results highlight AbMEGD's ability to balance
structural integrity with improved functionality, establishing a new benchmark
for sequence-structure co-design and affinity optimization. The code is

Motivation: 传统微调方法需要反向传播，不适合内存受限的边缘设备；现有无反向传播方法性能不足。

Result: SharpZO在CLIP模型上显著提升精度和收敛速度，平均性能提升7%。

Conclusion: SharpZO为无反向传播的VLM微调提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning vision language models (VLMs) has achieved remarkable performance
across various downstream tasks; yet, it requires access to model gradients
through backpropagation (BP), making them unsuitable for memory-constrained,
inference-only edge devices. To address this limitation, previous work has
explored various BP-free fine-tuning methods. However, these approaches often
rely on high-variance evolutionary strategies (ES) or zeroth-order (ZO)
optimization, and often fail to achieve satisfactory performance. In this
paper, we propose a hybrid Sharpness-aware Zeroth-order optimization (SharpZO)
approach, specifically designed to enhance the performance of ZO VLM
fine-tuning via a sharpness-aware warm-up training. SharpZO features a
two-stage optimization process: a sharpness-aware ES stage that globally
explores and smooths the loss landscape to construct a strong initialization,
followed by a fine-grained local search via sparse ZO optimization. The entire
optimization relies solely on forward passes. Detailed theoretical analysis and
extensive experiments on CLIP models demonstrate that SharpZO significantly
improves accuracy and convergence speed, achieving up to 7% average gain over
state-of-the-art forward-only methods.

Abstract: Explicit density learners are becoming an increasingly popular technique for
generative models because of their ability to better model probability
distributions. They have advantages over Generative Adversarial Networks due to
their ability to perform density estimation and having exact latent-variable
inference. This has many advantages, including: being able to simply
interpolate, calculate sample likelihood, and analyze the probability
distribution. The downside of these models is that they are often more
difficult to train and have lower sampling quality.
  Normalizing flows are explicit density models, that use composable bijective
functions to turn an intractable probability function into a tractable one. In
this work, we present novel knowledge distillation techniques to increase
sampling quality and density estimation of smaller student normalizing flows.
We seek to study the capacity of knowledge distillation in Compositional
Normalizing Flows to understand the benefits and weaknesses provided by these
architectures. Normalizing flows have unique properties that allow for a
non-traditional forms of knowledge transfer, where we can transfer that
knowledge within intermediate layers. We find that through this distillation,
we can make students significantly smaller while making substantial performance
gains over a non-distilled student. With smaller models there is a
proportionally increased throughput as this is dependent upon the number of
bijectors, and thus parameters, in the network.

Motivation: 扩散和流匹配模型在离线强化学习中虽然能捕捉丰富的多模态动作分布，但其迭代采样导致高推理成本和训练不稳定。

Method: SSCP通过增强的流匹配目标训练生成策略，直接从中间流样本预测完成向量，实现一次性动作生成。

Result: SSCP在离线、离线到在线和在线强化学习场景中表现优异，速度和适应性优于扩散基线。

Conclusion: SSCP是一种高效、表达力强的深度强化学习和序列决策框架。

Abstract: Generative models such as diffusion and flow-matching offer expressive
policies for offline reinforcement learning (RL) by capturing rich, multimodal
action distributions, but their iterative sampling introduces high inference
costs and training instability due to gradient propagation across sampling
steps. We propose the \textit{Single-Step Completion Policy} (SSCP), a
generative policy trained with an augmented flow-matching objective to predict
direct completion vectors from intermediate flow samples, enabling accurate,
one-shot action generation. In an off-policy actor-critic framework, SSCP
combines the expressiveness of generative models with the training and
inference efficiency of unimodal policies, without requiring long
backpropagation chains. Our method scales effectively to offline,
offline-to-online, and online RL settings, offering substantial gains in speed
and adaptability over diffusion-based baselines. We further extend SSCP to
goal-conditioned RL, enabling flat policies to exploit subgoal structures
without explicit hierarchical inference. SSCP achieves strong results across
standard offline RL and behavior cloning benchmarks, positioning it as a
versatile, expressive, and efficient framework for deep RL and sequential
decision-making.

Abstract: Molecular property prediction aims to learn representations that map chemical
structures to functional properties. While multimodal learning has emerged as a
powerful paradigm to learn molecular representations, prior works have largely
overlooked textual and taxonomic information of molecules for representation
learning. We introduce TRIDENT, a novel framework that integrates molecular
SMILES, textual descriptions, and taxonomic functional annotations to learn
rich molecular representations. To achieve this, we curate a comprehensive
dataset of molecule-text pairs with structured, multi-level functional
annotations. Instead of relying on conventional contrastive loss, TRIDENT
employs a volume-based alignment objective to jointly align tri-modal features
at the global level, enabling soft, geometry-aware alignment across modalities.
Additionally, TRIDENT introduces a novel local alignment objective that
captures detailed relationships between molecular substructures and their
corresponding sub-textual descriptions. A momentum-based mechanism dynamically
balances global and local alignment, enabling the model to learn both broad
functional semantics and fine-grained structure-function mappings. TRIDENT
achieves state-of-the-art performance on 11 downstream tasks, demonstrating the
value of combining SMILES, textual, and taxonomic functional annotations for
molecular property prediction.

Motivation: 解决持续学习中预训练模型的灾难性遗忘和任务干扰问题，特别是现有LoRA-based MoE方法中的干扰、冗余和路由模糊。

Method: MoRA将每个排名-r更新分解为r个排名-1组件，每个组件作为独立专家，通过中间激活推断其相关性，并结合排名修剪和激活预算实现稀疏激活。

Conclusion: MoRA通过细粒度的排名自适应和稀疏激活，有效解决了持续学习中的关键挑战，提升了预训练模型的持续学习能力。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) with large pre-trained models is challenged by
catastrophic forgetting and task interference. Existing LoRA-based
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) approaches mitigate forgetting by assigning and
freezing task-specific adapters, but suffer from interference, redundancy, and
ambiguous routing due to coarse adapter-level selection. However, this design
introduces three key challenges: 1) Interference: Activating full LoRA experts
per input leads to subspace interference and prevents selective reuse of useful
components across tasks. 2) Redundancy: Newly added experts often duplicate or
contradict existing knowledge due to unnecessary activation of unrelated ranks
and insufficient reuse of relevant ones. 3) Ambiguity: Overlapping features
across tasks confuse the router, resulting in unstable expert assignments. As
more experts accumulate, earlier task routing degrades, accelerating
forgetting. We propose MoRA, a Mixture-of-Rank Adaptive learning approach with
self-activated and sparse rank activation for CL. Unlike mixing multiple
low-rank matrices, MoRA decomposes each rank-r update into r rank-1 components,
each treated as an independent expert, enabling fine-grained mixture of rank-1
expert utilization while mitigating interference and redundancy. To avoid
ambiguous routing, we propose that each rank-1 expert can infer its own
relevance via intermediate activations. Coupled with our proposed rank pruning
and activation budgets, MoRA adaptively selects a sparse mixture of ranks per
input. We validate MoRA on continual learning tasks with CLIP and large
language models (LLMs), analyzing both in-domain learning and out-of-domain
forgetting/generalization during fine-tuning. MoRA shows significant
effectiveness on enhancing CL with PTMs, and improving generalization while
mitigating forgetting.

Abstract: Recent studies in federated learning (FL) commonly train models on static
datasets. However, real-world data often arrives as streams with shifting
distributions, causing performance degradation known as concept drift. This
paper analyzes FL performance under concept drift using information theory and
proposes an algorithm to mitigate the performance degradation. We model concept
drift as a Markov chain and introduce the \emph{Stationary Generalization
Error} to assess a model's capability to capture characteristics of future
unseen data. Its upper bound is derived using KL divergence and mutual
information. We study three drift patterns (periodic, gradual, and random) and
their impact on FL performance. Inspired by this, we propose an algorithm that
regularizes the empirical risk minimization approach with KL divergence and
mutual information, thereby enhancing long-term performance. We also explore
the performance-cost tradeoff by identifying a Pareto front. To validate our
approach, we build an FL testbed using Raspberry Pi4 devices. Experimental
results corroborate with theoretical findings, confirming that drift patterns
significantly affect performance. Our method consistently outperforms existing
approaches for these three patterns, demonstrating its effectiveness in
adapting concept drift in FL.

Conclusion: RL-Selector通过动态优化数据选择策略，有效减少冗余，提升训练效率和模型性能，为数据高效训练提供了新思路。

Abstract: Modern deep architectures often rely on large-scale datasets, but training on
these datasets incurs high computational and storage overhead. Real-world
datasets often contain substantial redundancies, prompting the need for more
data-efficient training paradigms. Data selection has shown promise to mitigate
redundancy by identifying the most representative samples, thereby reducing
training costs without compromising performance. Existing methods typically
rely on static scoring metrics or pretrained models, overlooking the combined
effect of selected samples and their evolving dynamics during training. We
introduce the concept of epsilon-sample cover, which quantifies sample
redundancy based on inter-sample relationships, capturing the intrinsic
structure of the dataset. Based on this, we reformulate data selection as a
reinforcement learning (RL) process and propose RL-Selector, where a
lightweight RL agent optimizes the selection policy by leveraging
epsilon-sample cover derived from evolving dataset distribution as a reward
signal. Extensive experiments across benchmark datasets and diverse
architectures demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing
state-of-the-art baselines. Models trained with our selected datasets show
enhanced generalization performance with improved training efficiency.

Abstract: Long-horizon goal-conditioned tasks pose fundamental challenges for
reinforcement learning (RL), particularly when goals are distant and rewards
are sparse. While hierarchical and graph-based methods offer partial solutions,
they often suffer from subgoal infeasibility and inefficient planning. We
introduce Strict Subgoal Execution (SSE), a graph-based hierarchical RL
framework that enforces single-step subgoal reachability by structurally
constraining high-level decision-making. To enhance exploration, SSE employs a
decoupled exploration policy that systematically traverses underexplored
regions of the goal space. Furthermore, a failure-aware path refinement, which
refines graph-based planning by dynamically adjusting edge costs according to
observed low-level success rates, thereby improving subgoal reliability.
Experimental results across diverse long-horizon benchmarks demonstrate that
SSE consistently outperforms existing goal-conditioned RL and hierarchical RL
approaches in both efficiency and success rate.

Conclusion: 该方法通过对抗性学习框架有效提升了技能发现的效率与多样性，尤其适用于高维环境。

Abstract: Unsupervised skill discovery aims to learn diverse and distinguishable
behaviors in open-ended reinforcement learning. For existing methods, they
focus on improving diversity through pure exploration, mutual information
optimization, and learning temporal representation. Despite that they perform
well on exploration, they remain limited in terms of efficiency, especially for
the high-dimensional situations. In this work, we frame skill discovery as a
min-max game of skill generation and policy learning, proposing a regret-aware
method on top of temporal representation learning that expands the discovered
skill space along the direction of upgradable policy strength. The key insight
behind the proposed method is that the skill discovery is adversarial to the
policy learning, i.e., skills with weak strength should be further explored
while less exploration for the skills with converged strength. As an
implementation, we score the degree of strength convergence with regret, and
guide the skill discovery with a learnable skill generator. To avoid
degeneration, skill generation comes from an up-gradable population of skill
generators. We conduct experiments on environments with varying complexities
and dimension sizes. Empirical results show that our method outperforms
baselines in both efficiency and diversity. Moreover, our method achieves a 15%
zero shot improvement in high-dimensional environments, compared to existing
methods.

Motivation: 联邦学习中数据分布随时间变化（概念漂移），现有方法主要关注真实漂移，忽略了虚拟或标签漂移，导致历史知识丢失和性能下降。

Method: FedDAA包含三个模块：聚类数量确定模块、真实漂移检测模块和概念漂移适应模块，分别用于优化聚类数量、区分漂移类型和适应新数据。

Conclusion: FedDAA通过明确区分漂移源并动态适应，有效解决了联邦学习中的多源概念漂移问题，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: In federated learning (FL), the data distribution of each client may change
over time, introducing both temporal and spatial data heterogeneity, known as
concept drift. Data heterogeneity arises from three drift sources: real drift
(a shift in the conditional distribution P(y|x)), virtual drift (a shift in the
input distribution P(x)), and label drift (a shift in the label distribution
P(y)). However, most existing FL methods addressing concept drift primarily
focus on real drift. When clients experience virtual or label drift, these
methods often fail to selectively retain useful historical knowledge, leading
to catastrophic forgetting. A key challenge lies in distinguishing different
sources of drift, as they require distinct adaptation strategies: real drift
calls for discarding outdated data, while virtual or label drift benefits from
retaining historical data. Without explicitly identifying the drift sources, a
general adaptation strategy is suboptimal and may harm generalization. To
address this challenge, we propose FedDAA, a dynamic clustered FL framework
designed to adapt to multi-source concept drift while preserving valuable
historical knowledge. Specifically, FedDAA integrates three modules: a cluster
number determination module to find the optimal number of clusters; a real
drift detection module to distinguish real drift from virtual/label drift; and
a concept drift adaptation module to adapt to new data while retaining useful
historical information. We provide theoretical convergence guarantees, and
experiments show that FedDAA achieves 7.84% to 8.52% accuracy improvements over
state-of-the-art methods on Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100.

Conclusion: 知识图谱生成的指令数据能有效提升大语言模型的性能。

Abstract: Teaching large language models (LLMs) to use tools is crucial for improving
their problem-solving abilities and expanding their applications. However,
effectively using tools is challenging because it requires a deep understanding
of tool functionalities and user intentions. Previous methods relied mainly on
LLMs to generate instruction data, but the quality of these data was often
insufficient. In this paper, we propose a new method that uses knowledge graphs
to generate high-quality instruction data for LLMs. Knowledge graphs are
manually curated datasets rich in semantic information. We begin by extracting
various query pathways from a given knowledge graph, which are transformed into
a broad spectrum of user queries. We then translate the relationships between
entities into actionable tools and parse the pathways of each query into
detailed solution steps, thereby creating high-quality instruction data. Our
experiments show that fine-tuning on just a small sample of this synthetic data
can significantly improve the tool utilization and overall capabilities of

Result: CHOOSE在保持存储和计算效率的同时，性能优于传统浅层Transformer，接近深层Transformer。

Conclusion: CHOOSE为资源受限的移动设备上部署Transformer算法提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Transformers have shown potential in solving wireless communication problems,
particularly via in-context learning (ICL), where models adapt to new tasks
through prompts without requiring model updates. However, prior ICL-based
Transformer models rely on deep architectures with many layers to achieve
satisfactory performance, resulting in substantial storage and computational
costs. In this work, we propose CHain Of thOught Symbol dEtection (CHOOSE), a
CoT-enhanced shallow Transformer framework for wireless symbol detection. By
introducing autoregressive latent reasoning steps within the hidden space,
CHOOSE significantly improves the reasoning capacity of shallow models (1-2
layers) without increasing model depth. This design enables lightweight
Transformers to achieve detection performance comparable to much deeper models,
making them well-suited for deployment on resource-constrained mobile devices.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms conventional
shallow Transformers and achieves performance comparable to that of deep
Transformers, while maintaining storage and computational efficiency. This
represents a promising direction for implementing Transformer-based algorithms
in wireless receivers with limited computational resources.

TL;DR: 论文提出FeDa4Fair库，用于生成评估联邦学习中公平性方法的异构数据集，并发布四个数据集和基准测试工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中的公平性问题是关键挑战，现有方法多关注单一敏感属性，忽略了客户端的多样性需求。

Method: 引入FeDa4Fair库，生成异构数据集，提供基准测试和公平性评估工具。

Result: 发布了四个异构数据集和相应基准，支持公平性方法的可控评估。

Conclusion: FeDa4Fair为联邦学习公平性研究提供了可重复的基准测试工具。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across multiple
clients without sharing clients' private data. However, fairness remains a key
concern, as biases in local clients' datasets can impact the entire federated
system. Heterogeneous data distributions across clients may lead to models that
are fairer for some clients than others. Although several fairness-enhancing
solutions are present in the literature, most focus on mitigating bias for a
single sensitive attribute, typically binary, overlooking the diverse and
sometimes conflicting fairness needs of different clients. This limited
perspective can limit the effectiveness of fairness interventions for the
different clients. To support more robust and reproducible fairness research in
FL, we aim to enable a consistent benchmarking of fairness-aware FL methods at
both the global and client levels. In this paper, we contribute in three ways:
(1) We introduce FeDa4Fair, a library to generate tabular datasets tailored to
evaluating fair FL methods under heterogeneous client bias; (2) we release four
bias-heterogeneous datasets and corresponding benchmarks to compare fairness
mitigation methods in a controlled environment; (3) we provide ready-to-use
functions for evaluating fairness outcomes for these datasets.

TL;DR: H-CMR是一种新的概念基础模型，通过分层概念记忆推理器提供概念和任务预测的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前概念基础模型仅对最终任务预测提供可解释性，而概念预测本身仍为黑盒，限制了模型的透明性。

Method: H-CMR利用有向无环图建模概念间关系，通过神经注意力机制选择逻辑规则，分层预测概念和任务。

Result: 实验表明H-CMR在保持高性能的同时，支持概念和模型干预，显著提升推理准确性和训练数据效率。

Conclusion: H-CMR通过增强概念和任务预测的可解释性，为人类交互和背景知识利用提供了新途径。

Abstract: Concept-Based Models (CBMs) are a class of deep learning models that provide
interpretability by explaining predictions through high-level concepts. These
models first predict concepts and then use them to perform a downstream task.
However, current CBMs offer interpretability only for the final task
prediction, while the concept predictions themselves are typically made via
black-box neural networks. To address this limitation, we propose Hierarchical
Concept Memory Reasoner (H-CMR), a new CBM that provides interpretability for
both concept and task predictions. H-CMR models relationships between concepts
using a learned directed acyclic graph, where edges represent logic rules that
define concepts in terms of other concepts. During inference, H-CMR employs a
neural attention mechanism to select a subset of these rules, which are then
applied hierarchically to predict all concepts and the final task. Experimental
results demonstrate that H-CMR matches state-of-the-art performance while
enabling strong human interaction through concept and model interventions. The
former can significantly improve accuracy at inference time, while the latter
can enhance data efficiency during training when background knowledge is
available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于中间层冗余和早期层信息聚合的观察，试图通过动态跳过中间层来提升效率。

Method: 使用学习门控机制动态跳过对称的中间层，并通过门控注意力机制防止跳过位置的关注。

Result: 在研究的规模下，未能显著改善计算效率与性能的权衡。

Conclusion: 方法未达预期效果，但代码已开源供进一步研究。

Abstract: Conditional computation is a popular strategy to make Transformers more
efficient. Existing methods often target individual modules (e.g.,
mixture-of-experts layers) or skip layers independently of one another.
However, interpretability research has demonstrated that the middle layers of
Transformers exhibit greater redundancy, and that early layers aggregate
information into token positions. Guided by these insights, we propose a novel
architecture that dynamically skips a variable number of layers from the middle
outward. In particular, a learned gating mechanism determines whether to bypass
a symmetric span of central blocks based on the input, and a gated attention
mechanism prevents subsequent tokens from attending to skipped token positions.
Residual norms are controlled with a 'sandwich' or 'perilayernorm' scheme and
gate sparsity with an adaptive regularization loss. We had aimed to reduce
compute requirements for 'simpler' tokens and potentially foster an emergent
multi-level representational hierarchy but, at the scales investigated, our
approach does not achieve improvements in the trade-off between validation
cross-entropy and estimated FLOPs compared to dense baselines with fewer
layers. We release our code at https://github.com/tim-lawson/skip-middle.

Motivation: 单细胞测序是破坏性过程，无法捕获同一细胞在扰动前后的表型，导致数据未配对。现有方法或强制配对或忽略未扰动与扰动细胞间关系。

Conclusion: Unlasting框架在未配对单细胞扰动数据中表现优异，结合GRN和掩码机制，为单细胞研究提供新工具。

Abstract: Estimating single-cell responses across various perturbations facilitates the
identification of key genes and enhances drug screening, significantly boosting
experimental efficiency. However, single-cell sequencing is a destructive
process, making it impossible to capture the same cell's phenotype before and
after perturbation. Consequently, data collected under perturbed and
unperturbed conditions are inherently unpaired. Existing methods either attempt
to forcibly pair unpaired data using random sampling, or neglect the inherent
relationship between unperturbed and perturbed cells during the modeling. In
this work, we propose a framework based on Dual Diffusion Implicit Bridges
(DDIB) to learn the mapping between different data distributions, effectively
addressing the challenge of unpaired data. We further interpret this framework
as a form of data augmentation. We integrate gene regulatory network (GRN)
information to propagate perturbation signals in a biologically meaningful way,
and further incorporate a masking mechanism to predict silent genes, improving
the quality of generated profiles. Moreover, gene expression under the same
perturbation often varies significantly across cells, frequently exhibiting a
bimodal distribution that reflects intrinsic heterogeneity. To capture this, we
introduce a more suitable evaluation metric. We propose Unlasting, dual
conditional diffusion models that overcome the problem of unpaired single-cell
perturbation data and strengthen the model's insight into perturbations under
the guidance of the GRN, with a dedicated mask model designed to improve
generation quality by predicting silent genes. In addition, we introduce a
biologically grounded evaluation metric that better reflects the inherent
heterogeneity in single-cell responses.

Motivation: 无人机导航自动化使其易受对抗攻击，现有鲁棒强化学习方法对分布外偏移泛化能力有限。

Result: 在复杂导航环境中，抗脆弱方法表现优于传统鲁棒方法，路径更短且冲突更少。

Conclusion: 抗脆弱框架能有效适应未知对抗攻击，提升无人机导航的鲁棒性。

Abstract: The increasing automation of navigation for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)
has exposed them to adversarial attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in
reinforcement learning (RL) through sensor manipulation. Although existing
robust RL methods aim to mitigate such threats, their effectiveness has limited
generalization to out-of-distribution shifts from the optimal value
distribution, as they are primarily designed to handle fixed perturbation. To
address this limitation, this paper introduces an antifragile RL framework that
enhances adaptability to broader distributional shifts by incorporating a
switching mechanism based on discounted Thompson sampling (DTS). This mechanism
dynamically selects among multiple robust policies to minimize adversarially
induced state-action-value distribution shifts. The proposed approach first
derives a diverse ensemble of action robust policies by accounting for a range
of perturbations in the policy space. These policies are then modeled as a
multiarmed bandit (MAB) problem, where DTS optimally selects policies in
response to nonstationary Bernoulli rewards, effectively adapting to evolving
adversarial strategies. Theoretical framework has also been provided where by
optimizing the DTS to minimize the overall regrets due to distributional shift,
results in effective adaptation against unseen adversarial attacks thus
inducing antifragility. Extensive numerical simulations validate the
effectiveness of the proposed framework in complex navigation environments with
multiple dynamic three-dimensional obstacles and with stronger projected
gradient descent (PGD) and spoofing attacks. Compared to conventional robust,
non-adaptive RL methods, the antifragile approach achieves superior
performance, demonstrating shorter navigation path lengths and a higher rate of
conflict-free navigation trajectories compared to existing robust RL techniques

Motivation: 安全关键系统中的RL策略易受观察空间中的分布外对抗攻击影响，导致决策不安全或次优。

Result: 在无人机避障场景中，抗脆弱策略比标准RL基线表现更好，累积奖励提高15%，冲突事件减少30%。

Conclusion: 抗脆弱强化学习在动态威胁环境中具有理论和实践可行性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) policies deployed in safety-critical systems,
such as unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) navigation in dynamic airspace, are
vulnerable to out-ofdistribution (OOD) adversarial attacks in the observation
space. These attacks induce distributional shifts that significantly degrade
value estimation, leading to unsafe or suboptimal decision making rendering the
existing policy fragile. To address this vulnerability, we propose an
antifragile RL framework designed to adapt against curriculum of incremental
adversarial perturbations. The framework introduces a simulated attacker which
incrementally increases the strength of observation-space perturbations which
enables the RL agent to adapt and generalize across a wider range of OOD
observations and anticipate previously unseen attacks. We begin with a
theoretical characterization of fragility, formally defining catastrophic
forgetting as a monotonic divergence in value function distributions with
increasing perturbation strength. Building on this, we define antifragility as
the boundedness of such value shifts and derive adaptation conditions under
which forgetting is stabilized. Our method enforces these bounds through
iterative expert-guided critic alignment using Wasserstein distance
minimization across incrementally perturbed observations. We empirically
evaluate the approach in a UAV deconfliction scenario involving dynamic 3D
obstacles. Results show that the antifragile policy consistently outperforms
standard and robust RL baselines when subjected to both projected gradient
descent (PGD) and GPS spoofing attacks, achieving up to 15% higher cumulative
reward and over 30% fewer conflict events. These findings demonstrate the
practical and theoretical viability of antifragile reinforcement learning for
secure and resilient decision-making in environments with evolving threat
scenarios.

Motivation: 通过优化微调过程，减少对昂贵计算和大数据的需求，同时保持性能。

Result: 在3B小模型上，平均准确率从0.43提升至0.55，数据使用量减少62%。

Conclusion: 该方法在性能和效率上均优于传统SFT，为后续研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: General-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) are frequently fine-tuned
through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance performance in specific
domains. Better results can be achieved by distilling the chain-of-thought of a
larger model at the cost of numerous expensive calls and a much greater amount
of data. We propose a novel blueprint for efficient fine-tuning that uses
reasoning only for complex data identified by entropy. Specifically, across two
small open models ($\approx 3B$) we split the training data into complexity
categories by a single token answer entropy (ROC AUC $0.73$), fine-tune large
language models (LLMs) via SFT and distillation, and show that our pipeline
significantly outperforms the standard SFT approach ($0.55$ vs $0.43$ average
accuracy) and provides comparable with distillation performance while using
$62\%$ less data ($0.55$ average accuracy for both). We publish our code and
data to facilitate further research in this direction.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新型的Norm-Aware Linear Attention机制，解决了线性注意力中查询范数被忽视和负值抑制的问题，提升了表达能力和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 线性注意力虽降低了复杂度，但忽视了查询范数的影响，导致熵差距和缺失内积交互。

Method: 通过解耦查询和键矩阵为范数和方向两部分，设计范数感知的核函数和范数一致性映射。

Result: 实验表明，NaLaFormer在视觉和语言任务上性能提升高达4.2%。

Conclusion: Norm-Aware Linear Attention机制有效恢复了动态稀疏性和范数分布，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Linear attention has emerged as a viable alternative to softmax attention by
reducing complexity from quadratic to linear in sequence length. To preserve
two fundamental properties of softmax, non-negativity and entropy reduction,
current works employ various linearly separatable kernel functions with $L1$
normalization instead of softmax operator. However, query norms are neglected
by the normalization operation in linear attention, such degradation heavily
leads to an entropy gap. Meanwhile, existing works inhibit negative values of
query and key vectors resulting in a missing inner-product interactions after
being mapped. To address these dual challenges, we propose a novel Norm-Aware
Linear Attention mechanism serving to restore norm-guided dynamic spikiness and
recover kernel-perturbed norm distributions. Specifically, we first decouple
query and key matrices into two components: norm and direction, to achieve
norm-aware spikiness control and norm consistency, respectively. We
mathematically reveal that the extent of entropy reduction varies with the
query norm in softmax normalization, motivating a query-norm aware kernel
function for dynamic control over entropy reduction. Furthermore, to ensure
norm consistency and enforce non-negativity constraints, we employ a
norm-preserving mapping to project all elements of the angular matrix into
positive values, leveraging cosine similarity to inhibit dimensions with
opposite directions. We conduct extensive experiments demonstrating that the
NaLaFormer improves performance on vision and language tasks, enhancing both
expressiveness and efficiency by up to 4.2\%.

Conclusion: DiLoCoX是首个成功应用于1000亿参数以上模型的去中心化训练框架。

Abstract: The distributed training of foundation models, particularly large language
models (LLMs), demands a high level of communication. Consequently, it is
highly dependent on a centralized cluster with fast and reliable interconnects.
Can we conduct training on slow networks and thereby unleash the power of
decentralized clusters when dealing with models exceeding 100 billion
parameters? In this paper, we propose DiLoCoX, a low-communication large-scale
decentralized cluster training framework. It combines Pipeline Parallelism with
Dual Optimizer Policy, One-Step-Delay Overlap of Communication and Local
Training, and an Adaptive Gradient Compression Scheme. This combination
significantly improves the scale of parameters and the speed of model
pre-training. We justify the benefits of one-step-delay overlap of
communication and local training, as well as the adaptive gradient compression
scheme, through a theoretical analysis of convergence. Empirically, we
demonstrate that DiLoCoX is capable of pre-training a 107B foundation model
over a 1Gbps network. Compared to vanilla AllReduce, DiLoCoX can achieve a 357x
speedup in distributed training while maintaining negligible degradation in
model convergence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
decentralized training framework successfully applied to models with over 100
billion parameters.

Motivation: 现有CNN-Transformer混合模型在EEG解码中存在局部与全局特征整合不足的问题，且缺乏显式的通道建模。

Result: 在五个运动想象数据集和两个癫痫检测数据集上，DBConformer性能优于10个基线模型，参数减少8倍以上。

Conclusion: DBConformer不仅性能优越，还具有生理可解释性，适用于稳健且可解释的EEG解码。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) transform
spontaneous/evoked neural activity into control commands for external
communication. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) remain the mainstream
backbone for EEG decoding, their inherently short receptive field makes it
difficult to capture long-range temporal dependencies and global inter-channel
relationships. Recent CNN-Transformer (Conformers) hybrids partially address
this issue, but most adopt a serial design, resulting in suboptimal integration
of local and global features, and often overlook explicit channel-wise
modeling. To address these limitations, we propose DBConformer, a dual-branch
convolutional Transformer network tailored for EEG decoding. It integrates a
temporal Conformer to model long-range temporal dependencies and a spatial
Conformer to extract inter-channel interactions, capturing both temporal
dynamics and spatial patterns in EEG signals. A lightweight channel attention
module further refines spatial representations by assigning data-driven
importance to EEG channels. Extensive experiments on five motor imagery (MI)
datasets and two seizure detection datasets under three evaluation settings
demonstrate that DBConformer consistently outperforms 10 competitive baseline
models, with over eight times fewer parameters than the high-capacity EEG
Conformer baseline. Further, the visualization results confirm that the
features extracted by DBConformer are physiologically interpretable and aligned
with sensorimotor priors in MI. The superior performance and interpretability
of DBConformer make it reliable for robust and explainable EEG decoding. Code
is publicized at https://github.com/wzwvv/DBConformer.

<details>

Motivation: 随着无人机（UAV）在民用空域的广泛应用，传统的异常检测方法难以识别新型威胁，且现有方法无法区分隐蔽对抗攻击与真实的分布外（OOD）事件。

Method: 设计了一个基于cGAN的框架，生成能欺骗IDS的对抗样本，并使用CVAE通过负对数似然来检测这些攻击。

Result: CVAE的检测性能显著优于传统的基于马氏距离的检测器，能够有效识别隐蔽对抗攻击。

Conclusion: 研究表明，先进的概率建模对提升IDS对抗生成模型驱动的网络入侵能力至关重要。

Abstract: The growing integration of UAVs into civilian airspace underscores the need
for resilient and intelligent intrusion detection systems (IDS), as traditional
anomaly detection methods often fail to identify novel threats. A common
approach treats unfamiliar attacks as out-of-distribution (OOD) samples;
however, this leaves systems vulnerable when mitigation is inadequate.
Moreover, conventional OOD detectors struggle to distinguish stealthy
adversarial attacks from genuine OOD events. This paper introduces a
conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN)-based framework for crafting
stealthy adversarial attacks that evade IDS mechanisms. We first design a
robust multi-class IDS classifier trained on benign UAV telemetry and known
cyber-attacks, including Denial of Service (DoS), false data injection (FDI),
man-in-the-middle (MiTM), and replay attacks. Using this classifier, our cGAN
perturbs known attacks to generate adversarial samples that misclassify as
benign while retaining statistical resemblance to OOD distributions. These
adversarial samples are iteratively refined to achieve high stealth and success
rates. To detect such perturbations, we implement a conditional variational
autoencoder (CVAE), leveraging negative log-likelihood to separate adversarial
inputs from authentic OOD samples. Comparative evaluation shows that CVAE-based
regret scores significantly outperform traditional Mahalanobis distance-based
detectors in identifying stealthy adversarial threats. Our findings emphasize
the importance of advanced probabilistic modeling to strengthen IDS
capabilities against adaptive, generative-model-based cyber intrusions.

Result: 在九种异构数据集上的实验表明，pFedDC优于现有方法。

Conclusion: pFedDC通过双提示学习和交叉融合有效解决了联邦学习中的异构性问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
decentralized clients without sharing local data, but is challenged by
heterogeneity in data, computation, and communication. Pretrained
vision-language models (VLMs), with their strong generalization and lightweight
tuning via prompts, offer a promising solution. However, existing federated
prompt-learning methods rely only on text prompts and overlook joint
label-domain distribution shifts. In this paper, we propose a personalized FL
framework based on dual-prompt learning and cross fusion, termed pFedDC.
Specifically, each client maintains both global and local prompts across vision
and language modalities: global prompts capture common knowledge shared across
the federation, while local prompts encode client-specific semantics and domain
characteristics. Meanwhile, a cross-fusion module is designed to adaptively
integrate prompts from different levels, enabling the model to generate
personalized representations aligned with each client's unique data
distribution. Extensive experiments across nine datasets with various types of
heterogeneity show that pFedDC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
methods.

Motivation: 当前MoE系统存在严重的负载不平衡问题，导致模型容量和计算资源利用率低下。

Method: 提出LPR框架，通过聚类视角优化专家路由，促进负载均衡。

Result: 实验表明，LPR将专家负载的基尼系数从0.70降至0.035，最小-最大专家负载比从1e-6提升至0.70，实现近乎完美的负载均衡。

Conclusion: LPR在保持下游性能的同时，显著提升了MoE模型的负载均衡性。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a key strategy for
scaling large language models (LLMs) efficiently. However, current MoE systems
suffer from severe load imbalance, where only a small subset of experts is
consistently activated during training and inference, leading to significant
underutilization of model capacity and computational resources. In this work,
we revisit expert routing through a clustering perspective and propose Latent
Prototype Routing (LPR), a novel routing framework that generalizes existing
approaches while promoting balanced expert utilization without compromising
downstream performance. Extensive experiments across multiple open-source MoE
models -- including DeepSeek-V3, Qwen3-MoE, and Mixtral -- demonstrate that LPR
reduces the Gini coefficient of expert load from 0.70 to 0.035 on average,
improves the min-max expert load ratio from 1e-6 to 0.70, achieving
near-perfect load balancing.

Motivation: 现有神经网络压缩方法主要通过测量重要性和冗余性来减少参数，但已有优化方案的进一步提升空间有限。

Result: 在多数测试模型中实现无损压缩至原大小的1/4，且与重要性剪枝方法兼容。

Conclusion: 该工作为一种新型压缩方法奠定了基础，可实现更小、更高效的神经网络模型。

Abstract: In neural network compression, most current methods reduce unnecessary
parameters by measuring importance and redundancy. To augment already highly
optimized existing solutions, we propose linearity-based compression as a novel
way to reduce weights in a neural network. It is based on the intuition that
with ReLU-like activation functions, neurons that are almost always activated
behave linearly, allowing for merging of subsequent layers. We introduce the
theory underlying this compression and evaluate our approach experimentally.
Our novel method achieves a lossless compression down to 1/4 of the original
model size in over the majority of tested models. Applying our method on
already importance-based pruned models shows very little interference between
different types of compression, demonstrating the option of successful
combination of techniques. Overall, our work lays the foundation for a new type
of compression method that enables smaller and ultimately more efficient neural
network models.

Conclusion: 多样化小批量选择框架在药物发现中具有潜力，可更快满足未满足的医疗需求。

Abstract: In many real-world applications, evaluating the goodness of instances is
often costly and time-consuming, e.g., human feedback and physics simulations,
in contrast to proposing new instances. In particular, this is even more
critical in reinforcement learning, as new interactions with the environment
(i.e., new instances) need to be evaluated to provide a reward signal to learn
from. As sufficient exploration is crucial, learning from a diverse mini-batch
can have a large impact and help mitigate mode collapse. In this paper, we
introduce diverse mini-batch selection for reinforcement learning and propose
to use determinantal point processes for this task. We study this framework in
the context of a real-world problem, namely drug discovery. We experimentally
study how our proposed framework can improve the effectiveness of chemical
exploration in de novo drug design, where finding diverse and high-quality
solutions is essential. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation with three
well-established molecular generation oracles over numerous generative steps.
Our experiments conclude that our diverse mini-batch selection framework can
substantially improve the diversity of the solutions, while still obtaining
solutions of high quality. In drug discovery, such outcome can potentially lead
to fulfilling unmet medication needs faster.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ScalaBL的可扩展贝叶斯低秩适应方法，通过随机变分子空间推理，解决了大型语言模型（LLMs）不确定性量化的问题，同时减少了额外参数的需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）存在幻觉和校准不足的问题，在高风险领域（如自主系统和医疗）中，量化其不确定性至关重要。现有方法因需要额外参数而难以扩展到大模型。

Method: 提出ScalaBL方法，在低秩适应的基础上，通过随机变分子空间推理进行贝叶斯推断，利用LoRA参数作为投影矩阵，将子空间样本映射到LLM的完整权重空间。

Result: 该方法仅需约1000个额外参数，性能与最先进方法相当，并成功扩展到迄今为止最大的贝叶斯LLM，参数规模是之前工作的四倍。

Conclusion: ScalaBL是一种高效且可扩展的方法，能够在不增加过多参数的情况下，实现大型语言模型的不确定性量化。

Abstract: Despite their widespread use, large language models (LLMs) are known to
hallucinate incorrect information and be poorly calibrated. This makes the
uncertainty quantification of these models of critical importance, especially
in high-stakes domains, such as autonomy and healthcare. Prior work has made
Bayesian deep learning-based approaches to this problem more tractable by
performing inference over the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) parameters of a
fine-tuned model. While effective, these approaches struggle to scale to larger
LLMs due to requiring further additional parameters compared to LoRA. In this
work we present $\textbf{Scala}$ble $\textbf{B}$ayesian $\textbf{L}$ow-Rank
Adaptation via Stochastic Variational Subspace Inference (ScalaBL). We perform
Bayesian inference in an $r$-dimensional subspace, for LoRA rank $r$. By
repurposing the LoRA parameters as projection matrices, we are able to map
samples from this subspace into the full weight space of the LLM. This allows
us to learn all the parameters of our approach using stochastic variational
inference. Despite the low dimensionality of our subspace, we are able to
achieve competitive performance with state-of-the-art approaches while only
requiring ${\sim}1000$ additional parameters. Furthermore, it allows us to
scale up to the largest Bayesian LLM to date, with four times as a many base
parameters as prior work.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了在持续性投票系统中引入人工智能代表（Artificial Delegates）以弥补缺席投票对公平性和代表性的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有持续性投票规则依赖完全参与和完整偏好信息，但现实中部分参与是常态，导致公平性问题。

Method: 通过引入人工智能代表（偏好学习代理）来代表缺席选民，研究其对投票公平性和代表性的影响。

Result: 缺席显著影响公平性，但人工智能代表能有效缓解这些影响，提升系统鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 人工智能代表在持续性投票系统中能有效弥补缺席投票的负面影响，增强公平性和代表性。

Abstract: Perpetual voting addresses fairness in sequential collective decision-making
by evaluating representational equity over time. However, existing perpetual
voting rules rely on full participation and complete approval information,
assumptions that rarely hold in practice, where partial turnout is the norm. In
this work, we study the integration of Artificial Delegates,
preference-learning agents trained to represent absent voters, into perpetual
voting systems. We examine how absenteeism affects fairness and
representativeness under various voting methods and evaluate the extent to
which Artificial Delegates can compensate for missing participation. Our
findings indicate that while absenteeism significantly affects fairness,
Artificial Delegates reliably mitigate these effects and enhance robustness
across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Component obsolescence poses significant challenges in industries reliant on

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究随机种子技术在k-means和k-GMM中的表现，探索如何通过改进种子选择方法提升聚类效果。

Method: 提出基于前瞻原则和多轮策略的种子选择方法，优化种子采样和选择的度量标准。

Result: 实验表明，新方法在SSE（k-means）和log-likelihood（k-GMM）上优于经典方法，且计算开销适中。

Conclusion: 新方法有望成为标准技术，并为理论分析提供了新思路。

Abstract: We revisit the randomized seeding techniques for k-means clustering and k-GMM
(Gaussian Mixture model fitting with Expectation-Maximization), formalizing
their three key ingredients: the metric used for seed sampling, the number of
candidate seeds, and the metric used for seed selection. This analysis yields
novel families of initialization methods exploiting a lookahead
principle--conditioning the seed selection to an enhanced coherence with the
final metric used to assess the algorithm, and a multipass strategy to tame
down the effect of randomization.
  Experiments show a consistent constant factor improvement over classical
contenders in terms of the final metric (SSE for k-means, log-likelihood for
k-GMM), at a modest overhead. In particular, for k-means, our methods improve
on the recently designed multi-swap strategy, which was the first one to
outperform the greedy k-means++ seeding.
  Our experimental analysis also shed light on subtle properties of k-means
often overlooked, including the (lack of) correlations between the SSE upon
seeding and the final SSE, the variance reduction phenomena observed in
iterative seeding methods, and the sensitivity of the final SSE to the pool
size for greedy methods.
  Practically, our most effective seeding methods are strong candidates to
become one of the--if not the--standard techniques. From a theoretical
perspective, our formalization of seeding opens the door to a new line of
analytical approaches.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为AGTCNet的新型图-时序卷积网络，用于解决脑机接口（BCI）系统中多通道脑电图（EEG）信号的时空依赖性分类问题。该模型显著优于现有方法，并在多个数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管BCI技术具有巨大潜力，但由于神经活动的复杂性和变异性，开发跨受试者和跨会话的鲁棒系统仍具挑战性。现有方法未能有效捕捉EEG信号的时空依赖性。

Method: AGTCNet结合了EEG电极的地形配置作为归纳偏置，并集成了图卷积注意力网络（GCAT），以联合学习时空EEG表示。

Result: AGTCNet在多个数据集上表现优异，例如在BCI Competition IV Dataset 2a上实现了66.82%的跨受试者分类准确率，经微调后提升至82.88%。

Conclusion: AGTCNet通过紧凑的架构和高效的性能，为BCI系统的实际部署提供了有效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology utilizing electroencephalography
(EEG) marks a transformative innovation, empowering motor-impaired individuals
to engage with their environment on equal footing. Despite its promising
potential, developing subject-invariant and session-invariant BCI systems
remains a significant challenge due to the inherent complexity and variability
of neural activity across individuals and over time, compounded by EEG hardware
constraints. While prior studies have sought to develop robust BCI systems,
existing approaches remain ineffective in capturing the intricate
spatiotemporal dependencies within multichannel EEG signals. This study
addresses this gap by introducing the attentive graph-temporal convolutional
network (AGTCNet), a novel graph-temporal model for motor imagery EEG (MI-EEG)
classification. Specifically, AGTCNet leverages the topographic configuration
of EEG electrodes as an inductive bias and integrates graph convolutional
attention network (GCAT) to jointly learn expressive spatiotemporal EEG
representations. The proposed model significantly outperformed existing MI-EEG
classifiers, achieving state-of-the-art performance while utilizing a compact
architecture, underscoring its effectiveness and practicality for BCI
deployment. With a 49.87% reduction in model size, 64.65% faster inference
time, and shorter input EEG signal, AGTCNet achieved a moving average accuracy
of 66.82% for subject-independent classification on the BCI Competition IV
Dataset 2a, which further improved to 82.88% when fine-tuned for
subject-specific classification. On the EEG Motor Movement/Imagery Dataset,
AGTCNet achieved moving average accuracies of 64.14% and 85.22% for 4-class and
2-class subject-independent classifications, respectively, with further
improvements to 72.13% and 90.54% for subject-specific classifications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基准测试无法满足实时信息处理需求，DynamicBench填补了这一空白。

Method: 采用双路径检索管道（网络搜索与本地报告数据库结合），并引入高级报告生成系统。

Result: 在无文档和有文档场景下分别超越GPT4o 7.0%和5.8%。

Conclusion: DynamicBench有效评估LLMs的实时信息处理能力，代码和数据将公开。

Abstract: Traditional benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) typically rely on
static evaluations through storytelling or opinion expression, which fail to
capture the dynamic requirements of real-time information processing in
contemporary applications. To address this limitation, we present DynamicBench,
a benchmark designed to evaluate the proficiency of LLMs in storing and
processing up-to-the-minute data. DynamicBench utilizes a dual-path retrieval
pipeline, integrating web searches with local report databases. It necessitates
domain-specific knowledge, ensuring accurate responses report generation within
specialized fields. By evaluating models in scenarios that either provide or
withhold external documents, DynamicBench effectively measures their capability
to independently process recent information or leverage contextual
enhancements. Additionally, we introduce an advanced report generation system
adept at managing dynamic information synthesis. Our experimental results
confirm the efficacy of our approach, with our method achieving
state-of-the-art performance, surpassing GPT4o in document-free and
document-assisted scenarios by 7.0% and 5.8%, respectively. The code and data
will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: 论文证明了持久拉普拉斯算子的特征值在添加单形时的变化具有一致Lipschitz界，为谱拓扑数据分析提供了特征值级别的鲁棒性保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持久拉普拉斯算子的特征值在数据形状和结构变化中扮演重要角色，但其在单形添加时的精确变化尚未明确，这对下游工具如热核签名和谱神经网络至关重要。

Method: 通过数学证明，建立了添加单形时持久拉普拉斯算子特征值变化的Lipschitz界。

Result: 证明了特征值变化不超过单形边界欧几里得范数的两倍，且与过滤尺度和复形大小无关。

Conclusion: 该结果为谱拓扑数据分析提供了特征值级别的稳定性保证，支持动态数据环境下的可靠误差控制。

Abstract: Persistent Laplacians are matrix operators that track how the shape and
structure of data transform across scales and are popularly adopted in biology,
physics, and machine learning. Their eigenvalues are concise descriptors of
geometric and topological features in a filtration. Although earlier work
established global algebraic stability for these operators, the precise change
in a single eigenvalue when one simplex, such as a vertex, edge, or triangle,
is added has remained unknown. This is important because downstream tools,
including heat-kernel signatures and spectral neural networks, depend directly
on these eigenvalues. We close this gap by proving a uniform Lipschitz bound:
after inserting one simplex, every up-persistent Laplacian eigenvalue can vary
by at most twice the Euclidean norm of that simplex's boundary, independent of
filtration scale and complex size. This result delivers the first
eigenvalue-level robustness guarantee for spectral topological data analysis.
It guarantees that spectral features remain stable under local updates and
enables reliable error control in dynamic data settings.

TL;DR: SMMILE是首个专家驱动的多模态ICL基准测试，用于评估MLLMs在医学任务中的表现，结果显示当前模型在多模态ICL能力上表现有限，且易受无关示例和顺序偏差影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索多模态ICL在医学领域的潜力，填补现有MLLMs在医学任务中多模态上下文学习能力的研究空白。

Method: 开发SMMILE和SMMILE++基准测试，包含专家设计的111个问题和1038个排列问题，评估15种MLLMs的表现。

Result: 大多数模型在医学任务中的多模态ICL能力中等或较差，ICL仅带来8%-9.4%的性能提升，且易受无关示例和顺序偏差影响。

Conclusion: 当前MLLMs在多模态医学任务中存在显著局限性和偏差，需进一步优化上下文学习能力。

Abstract: Multimodal in-context learning (ICL) remains underexplored despite
significant potential for domains such as medicine. Clinicians routinely
encounter diverse, specialized tasks requiring adaptation from limited
examples, such as drawing insights from a few relevant prior cases or
considering a constrained set of differential diagnoses. While multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) have shown advances in medical visual question
answering (VQA), their ability to learn multimodal tasks from context is
largely unknown. We introduce SMMILE, the first expert-driven multimodal ICL
benchmark for medical tasks. Eleven medical experts curated problems, each
including a multimodal query and multimodal in-context examples as task
demonstrations. SMMILE encompasses 111 problems (517 question-image-answer
triplets) covering 6 medical specialties and 13 imaging modalities. We further
introduce SMMILE++, an augmented variant with 1038 permuted problems. A
comprehensive evaluation of 15 MLLMs demonstrates that most models exhibit
moderate to poor multimodal ICL ability in medical tasks. In open-ended
evaluations, ICL contributes only 8% average improvement over zero-shot on
SMMILE and 9.4% on SMMILE++. We observe a susceptibility for irrelevant
in-context examples: even a single noisy or irrelevant example can degrade
performance by up to 9.5%. Moreover, example ordering exhibits a recency bias,
i.e., placing the most relevant example last can lead to substantial
performance improvements by up to 71%. Our findings highlight critical
limitations and biases in current MLLMs when learning multimodal medical tasks
from context.

respectively in the MuJoCo Continuous Control Suite from pixels, and

Abstract: Nowadays, the rapid growth of Deep Neural Network (DNN) architectures has
established them as the defacto approach for providing advanced Machine
Learning tasks with excellent accuracy. Targeting low-power DNN computing, this
paper examines the interplay of fine-grained error resilience of DNN workloads
in collaboration with hardware approximation techniques, to achieve higher
levels of energy efficiency. Utilizing the state-of-the-art ROUP approximate
multipliers, we systematically explore their fine-grained distribution across
the network according to our layer-, filter-, and kernel-level approaches, and
examine their impact on accuracy and energy. We use the ResNet-8 model on the
CIFAR-10 dataset to evaluate our approximations. The proposed solution delivers
up to 54% energy gains in exchange for up to 4% accuracy loss, compared to the
baseline quantized model, while it provides 2x energy gains with better
accuracy versus the state-of-the-art DNN approximations.

Result: 在NLP和视觉任务中表现优异，泛化性能提升。

Conclusion: NANOADAM通过选择性更新权重，高效且性能优越，适用于多种任务。

Abstract: Finetuning large pretrained neural networks is known to be
resource-intensive, both in terms of memory and computational cost. To mitigate
this, a common approach is to restrict training to a subset of the model
parameters. By analyzing the relationship between gradients and weights during
finetuning, we observe a notable pattern: large gradients are often associated
with small-magnitude weights. This correlation is more pronounced in finetuning
settings than in training from scratch. Motivated by this observation, we
propose NANOADAM, which dynamically updates only the small-magnitude weights
during finetuning and offers several practical advantages: first, this
criterion is gradient-free -- the parameter subset can be determined without
gradient computation; second, it preserves large-magnitude weights, which are
likely to encode critical features learned during pretraining, thereby reducing
the risk of catastrophic forgetting; thirdly, it permits the use of larger
learning rates and consistently leads to better generalization performance in
experiments. We demonstrate this for both NLP and vision tasks.

Abstract: Cryptocurrency transaction fraud detection faces the dual challenges of
increasingly complex transaction patterns and severe class imbalance.
Traditional methods rely on manual feature engineering and struggle to capture
temporal and structural dependencies in transaction networks. This paper
proposes an Augmented Temporal-aware Graph Attention Network (ATGAT) that
enhances detection performance through three modules: (1) designing an advanced
temporal embedding module that fuses multi-scale time difference features with
periodic position encoding; (2) constructing a temporal-aware triple attention
mechanism that jointly optimizes structural, temporal, and global context
attention; (3) employing weighted BCE loss to address class imbalance.
Experiments on the Elliptic++ cryptocurrency dataset demonstrate that ATGAT
achieves an AUC of 0.9130, representing a 9.2% improvement over the best
traditional method XGBoost, 12.0% over GCN, and 10.0% over standard GAT. This
method not only validates the enhancement effect of temporal awareness and
triple attention mechanisms on graph neural networks, but also provides
financial institutions with more reliable fraud detection tools, with its
design principles generalizable to other temporal graph anomaly detection
tasks.

Motivation: 表格基础模型在推理时成本较高，尤其是处理大数据集时。

Method: 动态评估是否在每一层Transformer编码器后停止上下文学习，并使用预训练的逐层解码器解码嵌入。

Result: 在34个小分类任务中，推理速度提升1.3倍，性能几乎无损；在5个更大任务中，速度提升2.2倍。

Conclusion: 早期退出是一种有效且实用的策略，可提高表格上下文学习的效率。

Abstract: Tabular foundation models have shown strong performance across various
tabular learning tasks via in-context learning, offering robust generalization
without any downstream finetuning. However, their inference-time costs remain
high, particularly for larger datasets. To address this, we propose
early-stopping the in-context learning process. We achieve this by dynamically
evaluating whether to stop in-context learning after each Transformer encoder
layer. Once stopped, we decode the embedding using a pre-trained layer-wise
decoder. Experiments across 34 small classification tasks size show that early
stopping in-context learning accelerates inference by up to x1.3 with
negligible degradation in predictive performance. To assess scalability, we
further evaluate our method on five larger classification tasks, achieving
speedups of up to x2.2. Our results demonstrate the potential of early exiting
as an effective and practical strategy for improving the efficiency of tabular
in-context learning.

Conclusion: D-CHAG方法显著提升了大规模图像模态数据集的处理效率，适用于高性能计算环境。

Abstract: Vision-based scientific foundation models hold significant promise for
advancing scientific discovery and innovation. This potential stems from their
ability to aggregate images from diverse sources such as varying physical
groundings or data acquisition systems and to learn spatio-temporal
correlations using transformer architectures. However, tokenizing and
aggregating images can be compute-intensive, a challenge not fully addressed by
current distributed methods. In this work, we introduce the Distributed
Cross-Channel Hierarchical Aggregation (D-CHAG) approach designed for datasets
with a large number of channels across image modalities. Our method is
compatible with any model-parallel strategy and any type of vision transformer
architecture, significantly improving computational efficiency. We evaluated
D-CHAG on hyperspectral imaging and weather forecasting tasks. When integrated
with tensor parallelism and model sharding, our approach achieved up to a 75%
reduction in memory usage and more than doubled sustained throughput on up to
1,024 AMD GPUs on the Frontier Supercomputer.

speakers engaged in truth or lie scenarios on emotionally relevant topics,
serves as the basis for our analysis. The results demonstrate that
incorporating both speech and facial information yields superior performance
compared to single-modality approaches. Moreover, including data from both
participants significantly enhances deception detection accuracy, with the best
performance (71%) achieved using a late fusion strategy applied to both
modalities and participants. These findings align with psychological theories
suggesting differential control of facial and vocal expressions during initial
interactions. As the first study of its kind on a Scandinavian cohort, this
research lays the groundwork for future investigations into dyadic
interactions, particularly within psychotherapy settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将最优控制理论与ResNet训练结合，探索一种理论支持的层剪枝策略。

Method: 通过惩罚隐藏状态的中间输出（类似于最优控制中的阶段成本项），优化ResNet的权重，并利用跳跃连接和输出层生成中间输出。

Result: 训练动态使得不必要的深层残差层权重趋近于零，表明该方法可用于层剪枝。

Conclusion: 该方法为理论支持的ResNet层剪枝提供了潜在途径。

Abstract: We propose a training formulation for ResNets reflecting an optimal control
problem that is applicable for standard architectures and general loss
functions. We suggest bridging both worlds via penalizing intermediate outputs
of hidden states corresponding to stage cost terms in optimal control. For
standard ResNets, we obtain intermediate outputs by propagating the state
through the subsequent skip connections and the output layer. We demonstrate
that our training dynamic biases the weights of the unnecessary deeper residual
layers to vanish. This indicates the potential for a theory-grounded layer
pruning strategy.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合遗传算法（GA）和强化学习（RL）的混合方法，用于自动发现启发式规则，优化低存储扩展稳定性Runge-Kutta（ESRK）方法。该方法在保持四阶精度的同时显著提高了计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高精度、低存储ESRK方法在平衡准确性、稳定性和计算效率方面的挑战。

Method: 采用GA驱动的突变进行搜索空间探索，并结合RL启发的状态转移机制动态优化启发式选择。

Result: 在基准测试中，最佳启发式规则实现了25%的IPOPT运行时间减少，同时保持数值稳定性和准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法为数值方法的启发式优化提供了新范式，并拓宽了低存储Runge-Kutta方法在计算流体动力学等领域的应用。

Abstract: Extended Stability Runge-Kutta (ESRK) methods are crucial for solving
large-scale computational problems in science and engineering, including
weather forecasting, aerodynamic analysis, and complex biological modelling.
However, balancing accuracy, stability, and computational efficiency remains
challenging, particularly for high-order, low-storage schemes. This study
introduces a hybrid Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Reinforcement Learning (RL)
approach for automated heuristic discovery, optimising low-storage ESRK
methods. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on manually designed
heuristics or exhaustive numerical searches, our method leverages GA-driven
mutations for search-space exploration and an RL-inspired state transition
mechanism to refine heuristic selection dynamically. This enables systematic
parameter reduction, preserving fourth-order accuracy while significantly
improving computational efficiency.The proposed GA-RL heuristic optimisation
framework is validated through rigorous testing on benchmark problems,
including the 1D and 2D Brusselator systems and the steady-state Navier-Stokes
equations. The best-performing heuristic achieves a 25\% reduction in IPOPT
runtime compared to traditional ESRK optimisation processes while maintaining
numerical stability and accuracy. These findings demonstrate the potential of
adaptive heuristic discovery to improve resource efficiency in high-fidelity
simulations and broaden the applicability of low-storage Runge-Kutta methods in
real-world computational fluid dynamics, physics simulations, and other
demanding fields. This work establishes a new paradigm in heuristic
optimisation for numerical methods, opening pathways for further exploration
using Deep RL and AutoML-based heuristic search

Motivation: 由于Telangana地区女性对宫颈癌、乳腺癌和口腔癌的筛查率极低，且缺乏相关症状和筛查知识的认知，研究旨在通过技术手段提高癌症意识和筛查率。

Method: 使用决策树分类和支持向量分类算法分别预测宫颈癌和乳腺癌的易感性，并结合用户地理位置推荐最近的医院或癌症治疗中心。此外，整合健康卡以维护个人医疗记录，并开展宣传活动。

Result: 开发了一个综合系统，能够预测癌症易感性、提供医疗服务建议，并支持健康记录管理和宣传活动。

Conclusion: 该研究通过技术手段提高了癌症意识和筛查率，为实现降低癌症死亡率和提高癌症知识的目标迈出了一步。

Abstract: According to the data, the percent of women who underwent screening for
cervical cancer, breast and oral cancer in Telangana in the year 2020 was 3.3
percent, 0.3 percent and 2.3 percent respectively. Although early detection is
the only way to reduce morbidity and mortality, people have very low awareness
about cervical and breast cancer signs and symptoms and screening practices. We
developed an ML classification model to predict if a person is susceptible to
breast or cervical cancer based on demographic factors. We devised a system to
provide suggestions for the nearest hospital or Cancer treatment centres based
on the users location or address. In addition to this, we can integrate the
health card to maintain medical records of all individuals and conduct
awareness drives and campaigns. For ML classification models, we used decision
tree classification and support vector classification algorithms for cervical
cancer susceptibility and breast cancer susceptibility respectively. Thus, by
devising this solution we come one step closer to our goal which is spreading
cancer awareness, thereby, decreasing the cancer mortality and increasing
cancer literacy among the people of Telangana.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无监督故障诊断方法，结合多变量时间序列分析、过程挖掘和随机模拟，用于CPS中的故障建模与分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动建模故障行为需要大量领域知识，且模型复杂、易错、难以解释，因此需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 通过多变量时间序列分析检测异常，将其转化为事件日志，利用过程挖掘提取可解释的模型，并结合随机模拟增强根因分析。

Result: 在Robotic Arm Dataset上验证了方法的有效性，能够建模、模拟和分类故障行为。

Conclusion: 该方法支持创建全面的故障字典，有助于预测性维护和工业环境中的数字孪生开发。

Abstract: Fault diagnosis in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) is essential for ensuring
system dependability and operational efficiency by accurately detecting
anomalies and identifying their root causes. However, the manual modeling of
faulty behaviors often demands extensive domain expertise and produces models
that are complex, error-prone, and difficult to interpret. To address this
challenge, we present a novel unsupervised fault diagnosis methodology that
integrates collective anomaly detection in multivariate time series, process
mining, and stochastic simulation. Initially, collective anomalies are detected
from low-level sensor data using multivariate time-series analysis. These
anomalies are then transformed into structured event logs, enabling the
discovery of interpretable process models through process mining. By
incorporating timing distributions into the extracted Petri nets, the approach
supports stochastic simulation of faulty behaviors, thereby enhancing root
cause analysis and behavioral understanding. The methodology is validated using
the Robotic Arm Dataset (RoAD), a widely recognized benchmark in smart
manufacturing. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness in modeling,
simulating, and classifying faulty behaviors in CPSs. This enables the creation
of comprehensive fault dictionaries that support predictive maintenance and the
development of digital twins for industrial environments.

Method: 引入mTSBench基准，评估24种异常检测方法（包括基于大语言模型的方法），并系统比较无监督模型选择技术。

Result: 结果表明，没有单一检测器在所有数据集上表现优异，且现有模型选择方法仍远未达到最优。

Conclusion: mTSBench提供了一个统一的评估框架，支持严格、可重复的比较，推动自适应异常检测和稳健模型选择的未来研究。

Abstract: Multivariate time series anomaly detection (MTS-AD) is critical in domains
like healthcare, cybersecurity, and industrial monitoring, yet remains
challenging due to complex inter-variable dependencies, temporal dynamics, and
sparse anomaly labels. We introduce mTSBench, the largest benchmark to date for
MTS-AD and unsupervised model selection, spanning 344 labeled time series
across 19 datasets and 12 diverse application domains. mTSBench evaluates 24
anomaly detection methods, including large language model (LLM)-based detectors
for multivariate time series, and systematically benchmarks unsupervised model
selection techniques under standardized conditions. Consistent with prior
findings, our results confirm that no single detector excels across datasets,
underscoring the importance of model selection. However, even state-of-the-art
selection methods remain far from optimal, revealing critical gaps. mTSBench
provides a unified evaluation suite to enable rigorous, reproducible
comparisons and catalyze future advances in adaptive anomaly detection and
robust model selection.

### [242] [Where to find Grokking in LLM Pretraining? Monitor Memorization-to-Generalization without Test](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21551)
*Ziyue Li,Chenrui Fan,Tianyi Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现，在大规模预训练模型中（如7B LLM OLMoE）仍会出现“grokking”现象，即测试性能在训练损失收敛后持续提升。通过分析模型内部动态，揭示了从记忆到泛化的转换机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索神经网络训练中“grokking”现象的机制，尤其是在大规模预训练模型中的表现，以理解泛化能力的延迟出现。

Method: 通过预训练7B LLM OLMoE，计算训练损失并在多样化基准任务上评估泛化能力，同时开发新指标量化样本路径距离和复杂度。

Result: 验证了“grokking”现象在大规模预训练中仍存在，且样本路径从随机演变为结构化，复杂度降低。新指标能预测泛化性能提升。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了“grokking”的机制，提供了从记忆到泛化的解释，并开发了实用指标用于监控预训练中的泛化性能。

Abstract: Grokking, i.e., test performance keeps improving long after training loss
converged, has been recently witnessed in neural network training, making the
mechanism of generalization and other emerging capabilities such as reasoning
mysterious. While prior studies usually train small models on a few toy or
highly-specific tasks for thousands of epochs, we conduct the first study of
grokking on checkpoints during one-pass pretraining of a 7B large language
model (LLM), i.e., OLMoE. We compute the training loss and evaluate
generalization on diverse benchmark tasks, including math reasoning, code
generation, and commonsense/domain-specific knowledge retrieval tasks.
  Our study, for the first time, verifies that grokking still happens in the
pretraining of large-scale foundation models, though different data may enter
grokking stages asynchronously. We further demystify grokking's "emergence of
generalization" by investigating LLM internal dynamics. Specifically, we find
that training samples' pathways (i.e., expert choices across layers) evolve
from random, instance-specific to more structured and shareable between samples
during grokking. Also, the complexity of a sample's pathway reduces despite the
converged loss. These indicate a memorization-to-generalization conversion,
providing a mechanistic explanation of delayed generalization. In the study, we
develop two novel metrics to quantify pathway distance and the complexity of a
single pathway. We show their ability to predict the generalization improvement
on diverse downstream tasks. They are efficient, simple to compute and solely
dependent on training data. Hence, they have practical value for pretraining,
enabling us to monitor the generalization performance without finetuning and
test. Theoretically, we show that more structured pathways reduce model
complexity and improve the generalization bound.

Abstract: Robotic catching of flying objects typically generates high impact forces
that might lead to task failure and potential hardware damages. This is
accentuated when the object mass to robot payload ratio increases, given the
strong inertial components characterizing this task. This paper aims to address
this problem by proposing an implicitly impact-aware framework that
accomplishes the catching task in both pre- and post-catching phases. In the
first phase, a motion planner generates optimal trajectories that minimize
catching forces, while in the second, the object's energy is dissipated
smoothly, minimizing bouncing. In particular, in the pre-catching phase, a
real-time optimal planner is responsible for generating trajectories of the
end-effector that minimize the velocity difference between the robot and the
object to reduce impact forces during catching. In the post-catching phase, the
robot's position, velocity, and stiffness trajectories are generated based on
human demonstrations when catching a series of free-falling objects with
unknown masses. A hierarchical quadratic programming-based controller is used
to enforce the robot's constraints (i.e., joint and torque limits) and create a
stack of tasks that minimizes the reflected mass at the end-effector as a
secondary objective. The initial experiments isolate the problem along one
dimension to accurately study the effects of each contribution on the metrics
proposed. We show how the same task, without velocity matching, would be
infeasible due to excessive joint torques resulting from the impact. The
addition of reflected mass minimization is then investigated, and the catching
height is increased to evaluate the method's robustness. Finally, the setup is
extended to catching along multiple Cartesian axes, to prove its generalization
in space.

Abstract: Drones can inspect overhead power lines while they remain energized,
significantly simplifying the inspection process. However, localizing a drone
relative to all conductors using an onboard LiDAR sensor presents several
challenges: (1) conductors provide minimal surface for LiDAR beams limiting the
number of conductor points in a scan, (2) not all conductors are consistently
detected, and (3) distinguishing LiDAR points corresponding to conductors from
other objects, such as trees and pylons, is difficult. This paper proposes an
estimation approach that minimizes the error between LiDAR measurements and a
single geometric model representing the entire conductor array, rather than
tracking individual conductors separately. Experimental results, using data
from a power line drone inspection, demonstrate that this method achieves
accurate tracking, with a solver converging under 50 ms per frame, even in the
presence of partial observations, noise, and outliers. A sensitivity analysis
shows that the estimation approach can tolerate up to twice as many outlier
points as valid conductors measurements.

Abstract: A cooperative circumnavigation framework is proposed for multi-quadrotor
systems to enclose and track a moving target without reliance on external
localization systems. The distinct relationships between quadrotor-quadrotor
and quadrotor-target interactions are evaluated using a heterogeneous
perception strategy and corresponding state estimation algorithms. A modified
Kalman filter is developed to fuse visual-inertial odometry with range
measurements to enhance the accuracy of inter-quadrotor relative localization.
An event-triggered distributed Kalman filter is designed to achieve robust
target state estimation under visual occlusion by incorporating neighbor
measurements and estimated inter-quadrotor relative positions. Using the
estimation results, a cooperative circumnavigation controller is constructed,
leveraging an oscillator-based autonomous formation flight strategy. We conduct
extensive indoor and outdoor experiments to validate the efficiency of the
proposed circumnavigation framework in occluded environments. Furthermore, a
quadrotor failure experiment highlights the inherent fault tolerance property
of the proposed framework, underscoring its potential for deployment in
search-and-rescue operations.

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models extend vision-language models (VLM) by
integrating action generation modules for robotic manipulation. Leveraging
strengths of VLM in vision perception and instruction understanding, VLA models
exhibit promising generalization across diverse manipulation tasks. However,
applications demanding high precision and accuracy reveal performance gaps
without further adaptation. Evidence from multiple domains highlights the
critical role of post-training to align foundational models with downstream
applications, spurring extensive research on post-training VLA models. VLA
model post-training aims to address the challenge of improving an embodiment's
ability to interact with the environment for the given tasks, analogous to the
process of humans motor skills acquisition. Accordingly, this paper reviews
post-training strategies for VLA models through the lens of human motor
learning, focusing on three dimensions: environments, embodiments, and tasks. A
structured taxonomy is introduced aligned with human learning mechanisms: (1)
enhancing environmental perception, (2) improving embodiment awareness, (3)
deepening task comprehension, and (4) multi-component integration. Finally, key
challenges and trends in post-training VLA models are identified, establishing
a conceptual framework to guide future research. This work delivers both a
comprehensive overview of current VLA model post-training methods from a human
motor learning perspective and practical insights for VLA model development.

Abstract: Autonomous systems rely on sensors to estimate the environment around them.
However, cameras, LiDARs, and RADARs have their own limitations. In nighttime
or degraded environments such as fog, mist, or dust, thermal cameras can
provide valuable information regarding the presence of objects of interest due
to their heat signature. They make it easy to identify humans and vehicles that
are usually at higher temperatures compared to their surroundings. In this
paper, we focus on the adaptation of thermal cameras for robotics and
automation, where the biggest hurdle is the lack of data. Several multi-modal
datasets are available for driving robotics research in tasks such as scene
segmentation, object detection, and depth estimation, which are the cornerstone
of autonomous systems. However, they are found to be lacking in thermal
imagery. Our paper proposes a solution to augment these datasets with synthetic
thermal data to enable widespread and rapid adaptation of thermal cameras. We
explore the use of conditional diffusion models to convert existing RGB images
to thermal images using self-attention to learn the thermal properties of
real-world objects.

Result: 在VirtualHome WAH-NL和真实机器人实验中，成功率分别达到34%和25%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: STEP框架有效提升了长时程任务的成功率，证明了其在实际应用中的潜力。

Abstract: The ability to perform reliable long-horizon task planning is crucial for
deploying robots in real-world environments. However, directly employing Large
Language Models (LLMs) as action sequence generators often results in low
success rates due to their limited reasoning ability for long-horizon embodied
tasks. In the STEP framework, we construct a subgoal tree through a pair of
closed-loop models: a subgoal decomposition model and a leaf node termination
model. Within this framework, we develop a hierarchical tree structure that
spans from coarse to fine resolutions. The subgoal decomposition model
leverages a foundation LLM to break down complex goals into manageable
subgoals, thereby spanning the subgoal tree. The leaf node termination model
provides real-time feedback based on environmental states, determining when to
terminate the tree spanning and ensuring each leaf node can be directly
converted into a primitive action. Experiments conducted in both the
VirtualHome WAH-NL benchmark and on real robots demonstrate that STEP achieves
long-horizon embodied task completion with success rates up to 34% (WAH-NL) and
25% (real robot) outperforming SOTA methods.

Abstract: Ensuring robust planning and decision-making under rare, diverse, and
visually degraded long-tail scenarios remains a fundamental challenge for
autonomous driving in urban environments. This issue becomes more critical in
cooperative settings, where vehicles and infrastructure jointly perceive and
reason across complex environments. To address this challenge, we propose
V2X-REALM, a vision-language model (VLM)-based framework with adaptive
multimodal learning for robust cooperative autonomous driving under long-tail
scenarios. V2X-REALM introduces three core innovations: (i) a prompt-driven
long-tail scenario generation and evaluation pipeline that leverages foundation
models to synthesize realistic long-tail conditions such as snow and fog across
vehicle- and infrastructure-side views, enriching training diversity
efficiently; (ii) a gated multi-scenario adaptive attention module that
modulates the visual stream using scenario priors to recalibrate ambiguous or
corrupted features; and (iii) a multi-task scenario-aware contrastive learning
objective that improves multimodal alignment and promotes cross-scenario
feature separability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that V2X-REALM
significantly outperforms existing baselines in robustness, semantic reasoning,
safety, and planning accuracy under complex, challenging driving conditions,
advancing the scalability of end-to-end cooperative autonomous driving.

Abstract: Imitation learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm in robot manipulation,
yet its generalization capability remains constrained by object-specific
dependencies in limited expert demonstrations. To address this challenge, we
propose knowledge-driven imitation learning, a framework that leverages
external structural semantic knowledge to abstract object representations
within the same category. We introduce a novel semantic keypoint graph as a
knowledge template and develop a coarse-to-fine template-matching algorithm
that optimizes both structural consistency and semantic similarity. Evaluated
on three real-world robotic manipulation tasks, our method achieves superior
performance, surpassing image-based diffusion policies with only one-quarter of
the expert demonstrations. Extensive experiments further demonstrate its
robustness across novel objects, backgrounds, and lighting conditions. This
work pioneers a knowledge-driven approach to data-efficient robotic learning in
real-world settings. Code and more materials are available on

Result: 实验表明，CURL-SLAM在3D地图质量和轨迹精度上达到先进水平，并在CPU上实现10Hz的实时性能。

Conclusion: CURL-SLAM提供了一种高效、紧凑且一致的LiDAR地图表示方法，适用于大规模环境。

Abstract: This paper studies 3D LiDAR mapping with a focus on developing an updatable
and localizable map representation that enables continuity, compactness and
consistency in 3D maps. Traditional LiDAR Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
(SLAM) systems often rely on 3D point cloud maps, which typically require
extensive storage to preserve structural details in large-scale environments.
In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm for LiDAR SLAM by leveraging the
Continuous and Ultra-compact Representation of LiDAR (CURL) introduced in [1].
Our proposed LiDAR mapping approach, CURL-SLAM, produces compact 3D maps
capable of continuous reconstruction at variable densities using CURL's
spherical harmonics implicit encoding, and achieves global map consistency
after loop closure. Unlike popular Iterative Closest Point (ICP)-based LiDAR
odometry techniques, CURL-SLAM formulates LiDAR pose estimation as a unique
optimization problem tailored for CURL and extends it to local Bundle
Adjustment (BA), enabling simultaneous pose refinement and map correction.
Experimental results demonstrate that CURL-SLAM achieves state-of-the-art 3D
mapping quality and competitive LiDAR trajectory accuracy, delivering
sensor-rate real-time performance (10 Hz) on a CPU. We will release the
CURL-SLAM implementation to the community.

Result: 实验表明，DRA-MPPI在动态环境中表现优于S-MPC、Frenet规划器和传统MPPI。

Conclusion: DRA-MPPI有效解决了动态环境中的安全规划问题，同时避免了机器人“冻结”现象。

Abstract: Deploying mobile robots safely among humans requires the motion planner to
account for the uncertainty in the other agents' predicted trajectories. This
remains challenging in traditional approaches, especially with arbitrarily
shaped predictions and real-time constraints. To address these challenges, we
propose a Dynamic Risk-Aware Model Predictive Path Integral control (DRA-MPPI),
a motion planner that incorporates uncertain future motions modelled with
potentially non-Gaussian stochastic predictions. By leveraging MPPI's
gradient-free nature, we propose a method that efficiently approximates the
joint Collision Probability (CP) among multiple dynamic obstacles for several
hundred sampled trajectories in real-time via a Monte Carlo (MC) approach. This
enables the rejection of samples exceeding a predefined CP threshold or the
integration of CP as a weighted objective within the navigation cost function.
Consequently, DRA-MPPI mitigates the freezing robot problem while enhancing
safety. Real-world and simulated experiments with multiple dynamic obstacles
demonstrate DRA-MPPI's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art
approaches, including Scenario-based Model Predictive Control (S-MPC), Frenet
planner, and vanilla MPPI.

Abstract: This paper introduces ACTLLM (Action Consistency Tuned Large Language Model),
a novel approach for robot manipulation in dynamic environments. Traditional
vision-based systems often struggle to learn visual representations that excel
in both task execution and spatial reasoning, thereby limiting their
adaptability in dynamic environments. ACTLLM addresses these challenges by
harnessing language to craft structured scene descriptors, providing a uniform
interface for both spatial understanding and task performance through flexible
language instructions. Moreover, we introduce a novel action consistency
constraint that aligns visual perception with corresponding actions, thereby
enhancing the learning of actionable visual representations. Additionally, we
have reformulated the Markov decision process for manipulation tasks into a
multi-turn visual dialogue framework. This approach enables the modeling of
long-term task execution with enhanced contextual relevance derived from the
history of task execution. During our evaluation, ACTLLM excels in diverse
scenarios, proving its effectiveness on challenging vision-based robot
manipulation tasks.

Result: 仿真结果显示，ADRC在所有测试条件下显著减少了横向跟踪误差，但增加了控制力和能耗；实地测试进一步证实了这些结果，并显示海上试验的能耗更高。

Conclusion: ADRC在轨迹跟踪控制中表现优于PID控制器，但需权衡其增加的能耗问题。

Abstract: Unmanned Surface Vessels (USVs) face significant control challenges due to
uncertain environmental disturbances like waves and currents. This paper
proposes a trajectory tracking controller based on Active Disturbance Rejection
Control (ADRC) implemented on the DUS V2500. A custom simulation incorporating
realistic waves and current disturbances is developed to validate the
controller's performance, supported by further validation through field tests
in the harbour of Scheveningen, the Netherlands, and at sea. Simulation results
demonstrate that ADRC significantly reduces cross-track error across all tested
conditions compared to a baseline PID controller but increases control effort
and energy consumption. Field trials confirm these findings while revealing a
further increase in energy consumption during sea trials compared to the
baseline.

Abstract: This research addresses critical autonomous vehicle control challenges
arising from road roughness variation, which induces course deviations and
potential loss of road contact during steering operations. We present a novel
real-time road roughness estimation system employing Bayesian calibration
methodology that processes axle accelerations to predict terrain roughness with
quantifiable confidence measures. The technical framework integrates a Gaussian
process surrogate model with a simulated half-vehicle model, systematically
processing vehicle velocity and road surface roughness parameters to generate
corresponding axle acceleration responses. The Bayesian calibration routine
performs inverse estimation of road roughness from observed accelerations and
velocities, yielding posterior distributions that quantify prediction
uncertainty for adaptive risk management. Training data generation utilizes
Latin Hypercube sampling across comprehensive velocity and roughness parameter
spaces, while the calibrated model integrates seamlessly with a Simplex
controller architecture to dynamically adjust velocity limits based on
real-time roughness predictions. Experimental validation on stochastically
generated surfaces featuring varying roughness regions demonstrates robust
real-time characterization capabilities, with the integrated Simplex control
strategy effectively enhancing autonomous vehicle operational safety through
proactive surface condition response. This innovative Bayesian framework
establishes a comprehensive foundation for mitigating roughness-related
operational risks while simultaneously improving efficiency and safety margins
in autonomous vehicle systems.

Conclusion: WorldVLA展示了动作与视觉模型的相互增强，注意力掩码策略有效解决了自回归动作生成的误差传播问题。

Abstract: We present WorldVLA, an autoregressive action world model that unifies action
and image understanding and generation. Our WorldVLA intergrates
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model and world model in one single framework. The
world model predicts future images by leveraging both action and image
understanding, with the purpose of learning the underlying physics of the
environment to improve action generation. Meanwhile, the action model generates
the subsequent actions based on image observations, aiding in visual
understanding and in turn helps visual generation of the world model. We
demonstrate that WorldVLA outperforms standalone action and world models,
highlighting the mutual enhancement between the world model and the action
model. In addition, we find that the performance of the action model
deteriorates when generating sequences of actions in an autoregressive manner.
This phenomenon can be attributed to the model's limited generalization
capability for action prediction, leading to the propagation of errors from
earlier actions to subsequent ones. To address this issue, we propose an
attention mask strategy that selectively masks prior actions during the
generation of the current action, which shows significant performance
improvement in the action chunk generation task.

Abstract: Controllable speech synthesis aims to control the style of generated speech
using reference input, which can be of various modalities. Existing face-based
methods struggle with robustness and generalization due to data quality
constraints, while text prompt methods offer limited diversity and fine-grained
control. Although multimodal approaches aim to integrate various modalities,
their reliance on fully matched training data significantly constrains their
performance and applicability. This paper proposes a 3-stage multimodal
controllable speech synthesis framework to address these challenges. For face
encoder, we use supervised learning and knowledge distillation to tackle
generalization issues. Furthermore, the text encoder is trained on both
text-face and text-speech data to enhance the diversity of the generated
speech. Experimental results demonstrate that this method outperforms
single-modal baseline methods in both face based and text prompt based speech
synthesis, highlighting its effectiveness in generating high-quality speech.

Abstract: This study presents and publicly releases the Suzhou Urban Road Acoustic
Dataset (SZUR-Acoustic Dataset), which is accompanied by comprehensive
data-acquisition protocols and annotation guidelines to ensure transparency and
reproducibility of the experimental workflow. To model the coupling between
vehicular noise and driving speed, we propose a bimodal-feature-fusion deep
convolutional neural network (BMCNN). During preprocessing, an adaptive
denoising and normalization strategy is applied to suppress environmental
background interference; in the network architecture, parallel branches extract
Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) and wavelet-packet energy features,
which are subsequently fused via a cross-modal attention mechanism in the
intermediate feature space to fully exploit time-frequency information.
Experimental results demonstrate that BMCNN achieves a classification accuracy
of 87.56% on the SZUR-Acoustic Dataset and 96.28% on the public IDMT-Traffic
dataset. Ablation studies and robustness tests on the Suzhou dataset further
validate the contributions of each module to performance improvement and
overfitting mitigation. The proposed acoustics-based speed classification
method can be integrated into smart-city traffic management systems for
real-time noise monitoring and speed estimation, thereby optimizing traffic
flow control, reducing roadside noise pollution, and supporting sustainable
urban planning.

TL;DR: 研究了在低资源音乐类型（如Hindustani Classical和Turkish Makam）中，如何通过不同适配器配置优化MusicGen和Mustango模型的性能，发现卷积和Transformer适配器各有优势，并分析了计算资源与性能的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模音乐生成模型的微调计算成本高，参数高效微调（PEFT）技术（如适配器）提供了一种替代方案，但其设计选择多样，缺乏针对特定低资源音乐类型的优化指导。

Method: 研究了MusicGen和Mustango模型在两种音乐类型上的不同适配器配置，包括卷积和Transformer适配器，并分析了其性能和资源需求。

Result: 卷积适配器擅长捕捉局部音乐细节，Transformer适配器更适合长程依赖；中等规模适配器（40M参数）在表达力和质量间取得平衡；Mustango生成多样性高但稳定性差，MusicGen训练更快且质量更高。

Conclusion: 适配器设计需根据任务需求选择，卷积和Transformer各有优势；Mustango适合多样性要求高的场景，MusicGen更适合高效高质量生成。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large-scale music generation models, such as MusicGen and
Mustango, is a computationally expensive process, often requiring updates to
billions of parameters and, therefore, significant hardware resources.
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques, particularly adapter-based
methods, have emerged as a promising alternative, enabling adaptation with
minimal trainable parameters while preserving model performance. However, the
design choices for adapters, including their architecture, placement, and size,
are numerous, and it is unclear which of these combinations would produce
optimal adapters and why, for a given case of low-resource music genre. In this
paper, we attempt to answer this question by studying various adapter
configurations for two AI music models, MusicGen and Mustango, on two genres:
Hindustani Classical and Turkish Makam music.
  Our findings reveal distinct trade-offs: convolution-based adapters excel in
capturing fine-grained local musical details such as ornamentations and short
melodic phrases, while transformer-based adapters better preserve long-range
dependencies crucial for structured improvisation. Additionally, we analyze
computational resource requirements across different adapter scales,
demonstrating how mid-sized adapters (40M parameters) achieve an optimal
balance between expressivity and quality. Furthermore, we find that Mustango, a
diffusion-based model, generates more diverse outputs with better adherence to
the description in the input prompt while lacking in providing stability in
notes, rhythm alignment, and aesthetics. Also, it is computationally intensive
and requires significantly more time to train. In contrast, autoregressive
models like MusicGen offer faster training and are more efficient, and can
produce better quality output in comparison, but have slightly higher
redundancy in their generations.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: DRAGON是一个灵活的框架，用于优化媒体生成模型，支持多种奖励函数，包括实例级和分布级评估，优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RLHF或DPO方法在奖励函数灵活性上受限，DRAGON旨在提供更通用的优化方案。

Method: DRAGON通过选择编码器和参考示例构建奖励函数，利用对比集优化模型。

Result: 在20种奖励函数测试中，DRAGON平均胜率为81.45%，且无需人类偏好标注即可提升生成质量。

Conclusion: DRAGON展示了设计奖励函数的新方法，显著提升生成内容的人类感知质量。

Abstract: We present Distributional RewArds for Generative OptimizatioN (DRAGON), a
versatile framework for fine-tuning media generation models towards a desired
outcome. Compared with traditional reinforcement learning with human feedback
(RLHF) or pairwise preference approaches such as direct preference optimization
(DPO), DRAGON is more flexible. It can optimize reward functions that evaluate
either individual examples or distributions of them, making it compatible with
a broad spectrum of instance-wise, instance-to-distribution, and
distribution-to-distribution rewards. Leveraging this versatility, we construct
novel reward functions by selecting an encoder and a set of reference examples
to create an exemplar distribution. When cross-modality encoders such as CLAP
are used, the reference examples may be of a different modality (e.g., text
versus audio). Then, DRAGON gathers online and on-policy generations, scores
them to construct a positive demonstration set and a negative set, and
leverages the contrast between the two sets to maximize the reward. For
evaluation, we fine-tune an audio-domain text-to-music diffusion model with 20
different reward functions, including a custom music aesthetics model, CLAP
score, Vendi diversity, and Frechet audio distance (FAD). We further compare
instance-wise (per-song) and full-dataset FAD settings while ablating multiple
FAD encoders and reference sets. Over all 20 target rewards, DRAGON achieves an
81.45% average win rate. Moreover, reward functions based on exemplar sets
indeed enhance generations and are comparable to model-based rewards. With an
appropriate exemplar set, DRAGON achieves a 60.95% human-voted music quality
win rate without training on human preference annotations. As such, DRAGON
exhibits a new approach to designing and optimizing reward functions for
improving human-perceived quality. Sound examples at

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 提出了一种可微分的短时傅里叶变换（STFT）方法，通过梯度优化参数，解决了传统方法依赖离散搜索的问题，并展示了其在提升时频表示和下游任务性能上的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统STFT参数调整依赖手动或启发式方法，效果不佳且计算量大。

Method: 提出统一的可微分STFT框架，支持基于梯度的参数优化，并与神经网络无缝集成。

Result: 实验证明该方法能有效优化时频表示并提升下游任务性能。

Conclusion: 可微分STFT为信号分析提供了更灵活高效的参数优化方案。

Abstract: The short-time Fourier transform (STFT) is widely used for analyzing
non-stationary signals. However, its performance is highly sensitive to its
parameters, and manual or heuristic tuning often yields suboptimal results. To
overcome this limitation, we propose a unified differentiable formulation of
the STFT that enables gradient-based optimization of its parameters. This
approach addresses the limitations of traditional STFT parameter tuning
methods, which often rely on computationally intensive discrete searches. It
enables fine-tuning of the time-frequency representation (TFR) based on any
desired criterion. Moreover, our approach integrates seamlessly with neural
networks, allowing joint optimization of the STFT parameters and network
weights. The efficacy of the proposed differentiable STFT in enhancing TFRs and
improving performance in downstream tasks is demonstrated through experiments
on both simulated and real-world data.

*Kehan Sui,Jinxu Xiang,Fang Jin*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: SmoothSinger是一种基于条件扩散模型的歌唱语音合成方法，通过统一框架直接优化低质量音频，避免了传统两阶段流程的失真问题，并在实验中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 歌唱语音合成需要精确建模音高、时长和发音，但现有扩散模型在合成时易产生失真，影响自然度。

Method: 采用参考引导的双分支架构，结合并行低频上采样路径，优化训练时的对齐问题。

Result: 在Opencpop数据集上，SmoothSinger在客观和主观评估中均达到最优效果。

Conclusion: SmoothSinger有效减少了合成语音的失真，提升了自然度。

Abstract: Singing voice synthesis (SVS) aims to generate expressive and high-quality
vocals from musical scores, requiring precise modeling of pitch, duration, and
articulation. While diffusion-based models have achieved remarkable success in
image and video generation, their application to SVS remains challenging due to
the complex acoustic and musical characteristics of singing, often resulting in
artifacts that degrade naturalness. In this work, we propose SmoothSinger, a
conditional diffusion model designed to synthesize high quality and natural
singing voices. Unlike prior methods that depend on vocoders as a final stage
and often introduce distortion, SmoothSinger refines low-quality synthesized
audio directly in a unified framework, mitigating the degradation associated
with two-stage pipelines. The model adopts a reference-guided dual-branch
architecture, using low-quality audio from any baseline system as a reference
to guide the denoising process, enabling more expressive and context-aware
synthesis. Furthermore, it enhances the conventional U-Net with a parallel
low-frequency upsampling path, allowing the model to better capture pitch
contours and long term spectral dependencies. To improve alignment during
training, we replace reference audio with degraded ground truth audio,
addressing temporal mismatch between reference and target signals. Experiments
on the Opencpop dataset, a large-scale Chinese singing corpus, demonstrate that
SmoothSinger achieves state-of-the-art results in both objective and subjective
evaluations. Extensive ablation studies confirm its effectiveness in reducing
artifacts and improving the naturalness of synthesized voices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对接方法和深度学习模型很少考虑共价键的形成及其结构变化，限制了共价药物设计的进展。

Method: 通过分解共价对接过程为三个任务，并采用Uni-Mol和Chemformer等先进模型建立基线性能。

Result: 基准测试能准确预测相互作用位点和分子转化，验证了其作为共价药物设计研究框架的有效性。

Conclusion: CovDocker为共价抑制剂发现提供了数据驱动方法，解决了治疗开发中的关键挑战。

Abstract: Molecular docking plays a crucial role in predicting the binding mode of
ligands to target proteins, and covalent interactions, which involve the
formation of a covalent bond between the ligand and the target, are
particularly valuable due to their strong, enduring binding nature. However,
most existing docking methods and deep learning approaches hardly account for
the formation of covalent bonds and the associated structural changes. To
address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark for covalent docking,
CovDocker, which is designed to better capture the complexities of covalent
binding. We decompose the covalent docking process into three main tasks:
reactive location prediction, covalent reaction prediction, and covalent
docking. By adapting state-of-the-art models, such as Uni-Mol and Chemformer,
we establish baseline performances and demonstrate the effectiveness of the
benchmark in accurately predicting interaction sites and modeling the molecular
transformations involved in covalent binding. These results confirm the role of
the benchmark as a rigorous framework for advancing research in covalent drug
design. It underscores the potential of data-driven approaches to accelerate
the discovery of selective covalent inhibitors and addresses critical
challenges in therapeutic development.

TL;DR: MegaFold是一个跨平台系统，旨在加速AlphaFold3（AF3）的训练，通过优化数据管道、内存管理和计算效率，显著提升了训练速度和序列长度支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AF3等蛋白质结构预测模型在计算和内存方面成本高昂，限制了其训练的可扩展性。MegaFold旨在解决这些瓶颈问题。

Method: MegaFold采用提前缓存、Triton内核优化和深度融合技术，分别解决了数据管道延迟、内存效率和计算效率问题。

Result: 在NVIDIA H200和AMD MI250 GPU上，MegaFold将AF3训练的峰值内存使用降低了1.23倍，训练速度分别提升了1.73倍和1.62倍，并支持更长的序列长度。

Conclusion: MegaFold显著提升了蛋白质折叠模型的可扩展性和训练效率，为现代生物分子建模提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Protein structure prediction models such as AlphaFold3 (AF3) push the
frontier of biomolecular modeling by incorporating science-informed
architectural changes to the transformer architecture. However, these advances
come at a steep system cost, introducing: compute- and memory-intensive
operators, 2D attention mechanisms, and retrieval-augmented data pipelines,
which collectively hinder the scalability of AF3 training. In this work, we
present MegaFold, a cross-platform system to accelerate AF3 training. MegaFold
tackles key bottlenecks through ahead-of-time caching to eliminate GPU idle
time from the retrieval-augmented data pipeline, Triton-based kernels for
memory-efficient EvoAttention on heterogeneous devices, and deep fusion for
common and critical small operators in AF3. Evaluation on both NVIDIA H200 and
AMD MI250 GPUs shows that MegaFold reduces peak memory usage of AF3 training by
up to 1.23$\times$ and improves per-iteration training time by up-to
1.73$\times$ and 1.62$\times$ respectively. More importantly, MegaFold enables
training on 1.35$\times$ longer sequence lengths compared to PyTorch baselines
without running out-of-memory, significantly improving the scalability of
modern protein folding models. We open source our code at

Motivation: 现实世界具有时空维度，而现有统计方法在性能和泛化能力上存在局限。

Conclusion: 新框架在时空反事实估计中表现优异，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: The real world naturally has dimensions of time and space. Therefore,
estimating the counterfactual outcomes with spatial-temporal attributes is a
crucial problem. However, previous methods are based on classical statistical
models, which still have limitations in performance and generalization. This
paper proposes a novel framework for estimating counterfactual outcomes with
spatial-temporal attributes using the Transformer, exhibiting stronger
estimation ability. Under mild assumptions, the proposed estimator within this
framework is consistent and asymptotically normal. To validate the
effectiveness of our approach, we conduct simulation experiments and real data
experiments. Simulation experiments show that our estimator has a stronger
estimation capability than baseline methods. Real data experiments provide a
valuable conclusion to the causal effect of conflicts on forest loss in
Colombia. The source code is available at

Motivation: 探索触觉反馈在虚拟现实密集人流中对用户行走行为的影响，以提升紧急疏散训练和建筑布局评估的效果。

Method: 通过用户研究，分析触觉反馈对用户行走轨迹、骨盆角度、横向位移和行走速度的影响。

Result: 触觉反馈增加了行走轨迹长度、骨盆角度变化和横向位移，增强了用户对碰撞的敏感性和视觉探索。

Conclusion: 触觉反馈提升了用户在虚拟现实环境中的碰撞敏感性和行为适应性。

Abstract: Human crowd simulation in virtual reality (VR) is a powerful tool with
potential applications including emergency evacuation training and assessment
of building layout. While haptic feedback in VR enhances immersive experience,
its effect on walking behavior in dense and dynamic pedestrian flows is
unknown. Through a user study, we investigated how haptic feedback changes user
walking motion in crowded pedestrian flows in VR. The results indicate that
haptic feedback changed users' collision avoidance movements, as measured by
increased walking trajectory length and change in pelvis angle. The
displacements of users' lateral position and pelvis angle were also increased
in the instantaneous response to a collision with a non-player character (NPC),
even when the NPC was inside the field of view. Haptic feedback also enhanced
users' awareness and visual exploration when an NPC approached from the side
and back. Furthermore, variation in walking speed was increased by the haptic
feedback. These results suggested that the haptic feedback enhanced users'
sensitivity to a collision in VR environment.

Motivation: 填补人类帮助聊天机器人动机研究的空白，基于CASA框架探索拟人化对亲社会行为的影响。

Method: 在线实验（N=244），聊天机器人在协作任务中犯错并解释原因，测量参与者的亲社会行为和意图。

Result: 聊天机器人的人类身份和情感表达增强了亲社会行为和意图，同理心起中介作用。定性分析揭示了同理心和拟人化感知是主要动机。

Conclusion: 研究结果为理解和促进人类对聊天机器人的亲社会行为提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Chatbots are increasingly integrated into people's lives and are widely used
to help people. Recently, there has also been growing interest in the reverse
direction-humans help chatbots-due to a wide range of benefits including better
chatbot performance, human well-being, and collaborative outcomes. However,
little research has explored the factors that motivate people to help chatbots.
To address this gap, we draw on the Computers Are Social Actors (CASA)
framework to examine how chatbot anthropomorphism-including human-like
identity, emotional expression, and non-verbal expression-influences human
empathy toward chatbots and their subsequent prosocial behaviors and
intentions. We also explore people's own interpretations of their prosocial
behaviors toward chatbots. We conducted an online experiment (N = 244) in which
chatbots made mistakes in a collaborative image labeling task and explained the
reasons to participants. We then measured participants' prosocial behaviors and
intentions toward the chatbots. Our findings revealed that human identity and
emotional expression of chatbots increased participants' prosocial behavior and
intention toward chatbots, with empathy mediating these effects. Qualitative
analysis further identified two motivations for participants' prosocial
behaviors: empathy for the chatbot and perceiving the chatbot as human-like. We
discuss the implications of these results for understanding and promoting human
prosocial behaviors toward chatbots.

Result: 高透明度机器人更易让用户将信息差异归因于外部因素，而用户倾向于过度信任机器人，即使怀疑系统故障或第三方干扰。

Conclusion: 研究强调了机器人透明度机制的重要性，多用户家庭机器人系统访问控制的复杂性，以及用户在敏感领域过度依赖机器人的潜在风险。

Abstract: Advancements in robotic capabilities for providing physical assistance,
psychological support, and daily health management are making the deployment of
intelligent healthcare robots in home environments increasingly feasible in the
near future. However, challenges arise when the information provided by these
robots contradicts users' memory, raising concerns about user trust and
decision-making. This paper presents a study that examines how varying a
robot's level of transparency and sociability influences user interpretation,
decision-making and perceived trust when faced with conflicting information
from a robot. In a 2 x 2 between-subjects online study, 176 participants
watched videos of a Furhat robot acting as a family healthcare assistant and
suggesting a fictional user to take medication at a different time from that
remembered by the user. Results indicate that robot transparency influenced
users' interpretation of information discrepancies: with a low transparency
robot, the most frequent assumption was that the user had not correctly
remembered the time, while with the high transparency robot, participants were
more likely to attribute the discrepancy to external factors, such as a partner
or another household member modifying the robot's information. Additionally,
participants exhibited a tendency toward overtrust, often prioritizing the
robot's recommendations over the user's memory, even when suspecting system
malfunctions or third-party interference. These findings highlight the impact
of transparency mechanisms in robotic systems, the complexity and importance
associated with system access control for multi-user robots deployed in home
environments, and the potential risks of users' over reliance on robots in
sensitive domains such as healthcare.

Abstract: The co creativity community is making significant progress in developing more
sophisticated and tailored systems to support and enhance human creativity.
Design considerations from prior work can serve as a valuable and efficient
foundation for future systems. To support this effort, we conducted a
systematic literature review of 62 papers on co-creative systems. These papers
cover a diverse range of applications, including visual arts, design, and
writing, where the AI acts not just as a tool but as an active collaborator in
the creative process. From this review, we identified several key dimensions
relevant to system design: phase of the creative process, creative task,
proactive behavior of the system, user control, system embodiment, and AI model
type. Our findings suggest that systems offering high user control lead to
greater satisfaction, trust, and a stronger sense of ownership over creative
outcomes. Furthermore, proactive systems, when adaptive and context sensitive,
can enhance collaboration. We also extracted 24 design considerations,
highlighting the value of encouraging users to externalize their thoughts and
of increasing the system's social presence and transparency to foster trust.
Despite recent advancements, important gaps remain, such as limited support for
early creative phases like problem clarification, and challenges related to
user adaptation to AI systems.

Abstract: Visualizations are crucial for data communication, yet understanding them
requires comprehension of both visual elements and their underlying data
relationships. Current multimodal large models, while effective in natural
image understanding, struggle with visualization due to their inability to
decode the data-to-visual mapping rules and extract structured information. To
address these challenges, we present a novel dataset and train multimodal
visualization LLMs specifically designed for understanding. Our approach
combines chart images with their corresponding vectorized representations,
encoding schemes, and data features. The proposed vector format enables compact
and accurate reconstruction of visualization content. Experimental results
demonstrate significant improvements in both data extraction accuracy and chart
reconstruction quality.

Result: 部分方法能准确恢复扩散项，表明PDE发现可从微观数据捕捉宏观动力学。

Conclusion: PDE发现展示了在生物系统中从微观数据推断宏观动力学的潜力。

Abstract: Biological systems are non-linear, include unobserved variables and the
physical principles that govern their dynamics are partly unknown. This makes
the characterization of their behavior very challenging. Notably, their
activity occurs on multiple interdependent spatial and temporal scales that
require linking mechanisms across scales. To address the challenge of bridging
gaps between scales, we leverage partial differential equations (PDE)
discovery. PDE discovery suggests meso-scale dynamics characteristics from
micro-scale data. In this article, we present our framework combining
particle-based simulations and PDE discovery and conduct preliminary
experiments to assess equation discovery in controlled settings. We evaluate
five state-of-the-art PDE discovery methods on particle-based simulations of
calcium diffusion in astrocytes. The performances of the methods are evaluated
on both the form of the discovered equation and the forecasted temporal
variations of calcium concentration. Our results show that several methods
accurately recover the diffusion term, highlighting the potential of PDE
discovery for capturing macroscopic dynamics in biological systems from
microscopic data.

Abstract: Estimating the governing equation parameter values is essential for
integrating experimental data with scientific theory to understand, validate,
and predict the dynamics of complex systems. In this work, we propose a new
method for structural system identification (SI), uncertainty quantification,
and validation directly from data. Inspired by generative modeling frameworks,
a neural network maps random noise to physically meaningful parameters. These
parameters are then used in the known equation of motion to obtain fake
accelerations, which are compared to real training data via a mean square error
loss. To simultaneously validate the learned parameters, we use independent
validation datasets. The generated accelerations from these datasets are
evaluated by a discriminator network, which determines whether the output is
real or fake, and guides the parameter-generator network. Analytical and real
experiments show the parameter estimation accuracy and model validation for
different nonlinear structural systems.

TL;DR: PTACL是一种多模态对比学习框架，通过整合CMR的时空信息增强ECG表征，提升心脏功能评估能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ECG无法直接测量心脏功能参数（如心室容积和射血分数），而CMR虽为金标准但昂贵且不易获取。PTACL旨在弥补这一差距。

Method: PTACL结合全局患者级和局部时间级对比损失，对齐ECG和CMR表征，无需引入新权重。

Result: 在27,951名受试者数据上，PTACL在患者检索和心脏功能参数预测任务中优于基线方法。

Conclusion: PTACL展示了通过ECG增强非侵入性心脏诊断的潜力。

Abstract: An electrocardiogram (ECG) is a widely used, cost-effective tool for
detecting electrical abnormalities in the heart. However, it cannot directly
measure functional parameters, such as ventricular volumes and ejection
fraction, which are crucial for assessing cardiac function. Cardiac magnetic
resonance (CMR) is the gold standard for these measurements, providing detailed
structural and functional insights, but is expensive and less accessible. To
bridge this gap, we propose PTACL (Patient and Temporal Alignment Contrastive
Learning), a multimodal contrastive learning framework that enhances ECG
representations by integrating spatio-temporal information from CMR. PTACL uses
global patient-level contrastive loss and local temporal-level contrastive
loss. The global loss aligns patient-level representations by pulling ECG and
CMR embeddings from the same patient closer together, while pushing apart
embeddings from different patients. Local loss enforces fine-grained temporal
alignment within each patient by contrasting encoded ECG segments with
corresponding encoded CMR frames. This approach enriches ECG representations
with diagnostic information beyond electrical activity and transfers more
insights between modalities than global alignment alone, all without
introducing new learnable weights. We evaluate PTACL on paired ECG-CMR data
from 27,951 subjects in the UK Biobank. Compared to baseline approaches, PTACL
achieves better performance in two clinically relevant tasks: (1) retrieving
patients with similar cardiac phenotypes and (2) predicting CMR-derived cardiac
function parameters, such as ventricular volumes and ejection fraction. Our
results highlight the potential of PTACL to enhance non-invasive cardiac
diagnostics using ECG. The code is available at:

learning based enhanced UNet model, U-R-Veda, which integrates convolution
transformations, vision transformer, residual links, channel-attention, and
spatial attention, together with edge-detection based skip-connections for an
accurate fully-automated semantic segmentation of cardiac magnetic resonance
(CMR) images. The model extracts local-features and their interrelationships
using a stack of combination convolution blocks, with embedded channel and
spatial attention in the convolution block, and vision transformers. Deep
embedding of channel and spatial attention in the convolution block identifies
important features and their spatial localization. The combined edge
information with channel and spatial attention as skip connection reduces
information-loss during convolution transformations. The overall model
significantly improves the semantic segmentation of CMR images necessary for
improved medical image analysis. An algorithm for the dual attention module
(channel and spatial attention) has been presented. Performance results show
that U-R-Veda achieves an average accuracy of 95.2%, based on DSC metrics. The
model outperforms the accuracy attained by other models, based on DSC and HD
metrics, especially for the delineation of right-ventricle and
left-ventricle-myocardium.

Abstract: 3D ultrasound (US) imaging has shown significant benefits in enhancing the
outcomes of percutaneous liver tumour ablation. Its clinical integration is
crucial for transitioning 3D US into the therapeutic domain. However,
challenges of tumour identification in US images continue to hinder its broader
adoption. In this work, we propose a novel framework for integrating 3D US into
the standard ablation workflow. We present a key component, a clinically viable
2D US-CT/MRI registration approach, leveraging 3D US as an intermediary to
reduce registration complexity. To facilitate efficient verification of the
registration workflow, we also propose an intuitive multimodal image
visualization technique. In our study, 2D US-CT/MRI registration achieved a
landmark distance error of approximately 2-4 mm with a runtime of 0.22s per
image pair. Additionally, non-rigid registration reduced the mean alignment
error by approximately 40% compared to rigid registration. Results demonstrated
the efficacy of the proposed 2D US-CT/MRI registration workflow. Our
integration framework advanced the capabilities of 3D US imaging in improving
percutaneous tumour ablation, demonstrating the potential to expand the
therapeutic role of 3D US in clinical interventions.

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用深度学习模型增强静态磁场B0不均匀性下光谱分析准确性的方法，通过模拟光谱训练模型，显著提高了分析精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决静态磁场B0不均匀性对光谱分析准确性的影响。

Method: 提出基于深度学习的新方法，利用模拟光谱训练模型，结合B0图和代谢物比例生成模拟光谱，并通过视觉和定量评估验证其质量。

Result: 模拟光谱与实测光谱接近，模型训练后MSE显著降低，性能优于LCModel。

Conclusion: 新方法通过增加训练样本，显著提高了光谱分析的准确性。

Abstract: Purpose:To develop a method that enhances the accuracy of spectral analysis
in the presence of static magnetic field B0 inhomogeneity. Methods:The authors
proposed a new spectral analysis method utilizing a deep learning model trained
on modeled spectra that consistently represent the spectral variations induced
by B0 inhomogeneity. These modeled spectra were generated from the B0 map and
metabolite ratios of the healthy human brain. The B0 map was divided into a
patch size of subregions, and the separately estimated metabolites and baseline
components were averaged and then integrated. The quality of the modeled
spectra was visually and quantitatively evaluated against the measured spectra.
The analysis models were trained using measured, simulated, and modeled
spectra. The performance of the proposed method was assessed using mean squared
errors (MSEs) of metabolite ratios. The mean absolute percentage errors (MAPEs)
of the metabolite ratios were also compared to LCModel when analyzing the
phantom spectra acquired under two types of B0 inhomogeneity. Results:The
modeled spectra exhibited broadened and narrowed spectral peaks depending on
the B0 inhomogeneity and were quantitatively close to the measured spectra. The
analysis model trained using measured spectra with modeled spectra improved
MSEs by 49.89% compared to that trained using measured spectra alone, and by
26.66% compared to that trained using measured spectra with simulated spectra.
The performance improved as the number of modeled spectra increased from 0 to
1,000. This model showed significantly lower MAPEs than LCModel under both
types of B0 inhomogeneity. Conclusion:A new spectral analysis-trained deep
learning model using the modeled spectra was developed. The results suggest
that the proposed method has the potential to improve the accuracy of spectral
analysis by increasing the training samples of spectra.

Motivation: 探索如何利用多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）自动化生成放射学报告，并优化3D CT报告生成的性能。

Method: 研究了3D MLLMs的设计空间，包括视觉输入表示、投影器、LLMs和微调技术，并引入了两种知识增强方法。

Result: 在1,687例AMOS-MM数据集上，RRG性能与LLM大小无关，更大的体积尺寸不一定提升性能，使用分割掩码可提升性能。

Conclusion: 3D MLLMs在放射学报告生成中具有潜力，设计选择和知识增强方法显著提升性能。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged as a promising way to
automate Radiology Report Generation (RRG). In this work, we systematically
investigate the design space of 3D MLLMs, including visual input
representation, projectors, Large Language Models (LLMs), and fine-tuning
techniques for 3D CT report generation. We also introduce two knowledge-based
report augmentation methods that improve performance on the GREEN score by up
to 10\%, achieving the 2nd place on the MICCAI 2024 AMOS-MM challenge. Our
results on the 1,687 cases from the AMOS-MM dataset show that RRG is largely
independent of the size of LLM under the same training protocol. We also show
that larger volume size does not always improve performance if the original ViT
was pre-trained on a smaller volume size. Lastly, we show that using a
segmentation mask along with the CT volume improves performance. The code is

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于DCT域的JPEG质量增强方法（AJQE），通过利用DCT系数中的两种关键相关性，显著提升了性能并降低了计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有JPEG质量增强方法多在像素域操作，计算成本高；而DCT域方法性能有限，亟需改进。

Method: 识别JPEG图像DCT系数中的两种关键相关性，提出AJQE方法，将像素域模型适配到DCT域。

Result: 相比像素域方法，AJQE在PSNR上平均提升0.35 dB，增强吞吐量提高60.5%。

Conclusion: AJQE方法在DCT域中实现了更高效的JPEG质量增强，为相关领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) achieves data compression by
quantizing Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) coefficients, which inevitably
introduces compression artifacts. Most existing JPEG quality enhancement
methods operate in the pixel domain, suffering from the high computational
costs of decoding. Consequently, direct enhancement of JPEG images in the DCT
domain has gained increasing attention. However, current DCT-domain methods
often exhibit limited performance. To address this challenge, we identify two
critical types of correlations within the DCT coefficients of JPEG images.
Building on this insight, we propose an Advanced DCT-domain JPEG Quality
Enhancement (AJQE) method that fully exploits these correlations. The AJQE
method enables the adaptation of numerous well-established pixel-domain models
to the DCT domain, achieving superior performance with reduced computational
complexity. Compared to the pixel-domain counterparts, the DCT-domain models
derived by our method demonstrate a 0.35 dB improvement in PSNR and a 60.5%
increase in enhancement throughput on average.

Abstract: This work introduces a novel framework for brain tumor segmentation
leveraging pre-trained GANs and Unet architectures. By combining a global
anomaly detection module with a refined mask generation network, the proposed
model accurately identifies tumor-sensitive regions and iteratively enhances
segmentation precision using adversarial loss constraints. Multi-modal MRI data
and synthetic image augmentation are employed to improve robustness and address
the challenge of limited annotated datasets. Experimental results on the BraTS
dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, achieving high
sensitivity and accuracy in both lesion-wise Dice and HD95 metrics than the

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种零样本去噪框架，用于低角度CPWC成像，通过自监督残差学习提升对比度，无需额外训练数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CPWC成像中增加角度数量会降低帧率并引入模糊伪影，且低角度采集易受噪声影响，需要一种无需训练数据的去噪方法。

Method: 将传输角度分为两个子集，分别生成含噪声的复合图像，通过自监督残差学习训练轻量级网络以分离噪声与组织信号。

Result: 在仿真、体模和活体数据中，该方法在对比度增强和结构保留方面优于传统和深度学习方法。

Conclusion: 该方法无需领域特定微调或配对数据，适用于不同解剖区域和采集设置，计算成本低。

Abstract: Ultrasound Coherent Plane Wave Compounding (CPWC) enhances image contrast by
combining echoes from multiple steered transmissions. While increasing the
number of angles generally improves image quality, it drastically reduces the
frame rate and can introduce blurring artifacts in fast-moving targets.
Moreover, compounded images remain susceptible to noise, particularly when
acquired with a limited number of transmissions. We propose a zero-shot
denoising framework tailored for low-angle CPWC acquisitions, which enhances
contrast without relying on a separate training dataset. The method divides the
available transmission angles into two disjoint subsets, each used to form
compound images that include higher noise levels. The new compounded images are
then used to train a deep model via a self-supervised residual learning scheme,
enabling it to suppress incoherent noise while preserving anatomical
structures. Because angle-dependent artifacts vary between the subsets while
the underlying tissue response is similar, this physics-informed pairing allows
the network to learn to disentangle the inconsistent artifacts from the
consistent tissue signal. Unlike supervised methods, our model requires no
domain-specific fine-tuning or paired data, making it adaptable across
anatomical regions and acquisition setups. The entire pipeline supports
efficient training with low computational cost due to the use of a lightweight
architecture, which comprises only two convolutional layers. Evaluations on
simulation, phantom, and in vivo data demonstrate superior contrast enhancement
and structure preservation compared to both classical and deep learning-based
denoising methods.

Abstract: This study investigates the impact of data source diversity on the
performance of cryptocurrency forecasting models by integrating various data
categories, including technical indicators, on-chain metrics, sentiment and
interest metrics, traditional market indices, and macroeconomic indicators. We
introduce the Crypto100 index, representing the top 100 cryptocurrencies by

Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that data source diversity
significantly enhances the predictive performance of forecasting models across

on-chain metrics for both short-term and long-term predictions, the growing
relevance of traditional market indices and macroeconomic indicators for
longer-term forecasts, and substantial improvements in model accuracy when
diverse data sources are utilized. These insights help demystify the short-term
and long-term driving factors of the cryptocurrency market and lay the
groundwork for developing more accurate and resilient forecasting models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统有理逼近方法对非光滑或奇异函数有效，但多项式逼近仅能实现代数收敛。近期研究表明复合多项式结构可恢复指数逼近速率，但需要针对不对称行为的函数设计更高效的方法。

Method: 引入一类加权深度多项式逼近器，通过将可学习的深度多项式与单侧权重相乘，捕捉局部非光滑性和全局增长。采用基于图的参数化策略进行优化。

Result: 数值实验表明，该方法在相同参数数量下优于泰勒、切比雪夫和标准深度多项式逼近器。

Conclusion: 加权深度多项式逼近器在捕捉不对称行为函数时表现优越，且通过稳定参数化策略实现高效优化。

Abstract: It is a classical result in rational approximation theory that certain
non-smooth or singular functions, such as $|x|$ and $x^{1/p}$, can be
efficiently approximated using rational functions with root-exponential
convergence in terms of degrees of freedom \cite{Sta, GN}. In contrast,
polynomial approximations admit only algebraic convergence by Jackson's theorem
\cite{Lub2}. Recent work shows that composite polynomial architectures can
recover exponential approximation rates even without smoothness \cite{KY}. In
this work, we introduce and analyze a class of weighted deep polynomial
approximants tailored for functions with asymmetric behavior-growing unbounded
on one side and decaying on the other. By multiplying a learnable deep
polynomial with a one-sided weight, we capture both local non-smoothness and
global growth. We show numerically that this framework outperforms Taylor,
Chebyshev, and standard deep polynomial approximants, even when all use the
same number of parameters. To optimize these approximants in practice, we
propose a stable graph-based parameterization strategy building on \cite{Jar}.

Conclusion: 自动化的审稿人选择策略为解决审稿人匹配问题提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Everyday, a vast stream of research documents is submitted to conferences,
anthologies, journals, newsletters, annual reports, daily papers, and various
periodicals. Many such publications use independent external specialists to
review submissions. This process is called peer review, and the reviewers are
called referees. However, it is not always possible to pick the best referee
for reviewing. Moreover, new research fields are emerging in every sector, and
the number of research papers is increasing dramatically. To review all these
papers, every journal assigns a small team of referees who may not be experts
in all areas. For example, a research paper in communication technology should
be reviewed by an expert from the same field. Thus, efficiently selecting the
best reviewer or referee for a research paper is a big challenge.
  In this research, we propose and implement program that uses a new strategy
to automatically select the best reviewers for a research paper. Every research
paper contains references at the end, usually from the same area. First, we
collect the references and count authors who have at least one paper in the
references. Then, we automatically browse the web to extract research topic
keywords. Next, we search for top researchers in the specific topic and count
their h-index, i10-index, and citations for the first n authors. Afterward, we
rank the top n authors based on a score and automatically browse their
homepages to retrieve email addresses. We also check their co-authors and
colleagues online and discard them from the list. The remaining top n authors,
generally professors, are likely the best referees for reviewing the research
paper.

Motivation: 传统有限元方法计算成本高且难以准确再现心脏运动，因此需要一种更高效且精确的方法来模拟心肌的生物力学行为。

Method: 通过MRI或超声心动图估计心脏运动，提取运动模式，并利用IMC-PINN-FE快速估计心肌刚度和主动张力，结合有限元建模。

Result: IMC-PINN-FE将计算时间从小时缩短到秒，运动匹配精度提高（Dice从0.849提升至0.927），同时保持真实的压力-体积行为。

Conclusion: IMC-PINN-FE提供了一种高效、个性化的心脏生物力学建模方法，显著优于传统方法。

Abstract: Elucidating the biomechanical behavior of the myocardium is crucial for
understanding cardiac physiology, but cannot be directly inferred from clinical
imaging and typically requires finite element (FE) simulations. However,
conventional FE methods are computationally expensive and often fail to
reproduce observed cardiac motions. We propose IMC-PINN-FE, a physics-informed
neural network (PINN) framework that integrates imaged motion consistency (IMC)
with FE modeling for patient-specific left ventricular (LV) biomechanics.
Cardiac motion is first estimated from MRI or echocardiography using either a
pre-trained attention-based network or an unsupervised cyclic-regularized
network, followed by extraction of motion modes. IMC-PINN-FE then rapidly
estimates myocardial stiffness and active tension by fitting clinical pressure
measurements, accelerating computation from hours to seconds compared to
traditional inverse FE. Based on these parameters, it performs FE modeling
across the cardiac cycle at 75x speedup. Through motion constraints, it matches
imaged displacements more accurately, improving average Dice from 0.849 to
0.927, while preserving realistic pressure-volume behavior. IMC-PINN-FE
advances previous PINN-FE models by introducing back-computation of material
properties and better motion fidelity. Using motion from a single subject to
reconstruct shape modes also avoids the need for large datasets and improves
patient specificity. IMC-PINN-FE offers a robust and efficient approach for
rapid, personalized, and image-consistent cardiac biomechanical modeling.

Conclusion: scMamba是处理大规模单细胞多组学数据的有力工具，能够推动生物学发现。

Abstract: The advent of single-cell multi-omics technologies has enabled the
simultaneous profiling of diverse omics layers within individual cells.
Integrating such multimodal data provides unprecedented insights into cellular
identity, regulatory processes, and disease mechanisms. However, it remains
challenging, as current methods often rely on selecting highly variable genes
or peaks during preprocessing, which may inadvertently discard crucial
biological information. Here, we present scMamba, a foundation model designed
to integrate single-cell multi-omics data without the need for prior feature
selection while preserving genomic positional information. scMamba introduces a
patch-based cell tokenization strategy that treats genomics regions as words
(tokens) and cells as sentences. Building upon the concept of state space
duality, scMamba distills rich biological insights from high-dimensional,
sparse single-cell multi-omics data. Additionally, our novel contrastive
learning approach, enhanced with cosine similarity regularization, enables
superior alignment across omics layers compared to traditional methods.
Systematic benchmarking across multiple datasets demonstrates that scMamba
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in preserving biological
variation, aligning omics layers, and enhancing key downstream tasks such as
clustering, cell type annotation, and trajectory inference. Our findings
position scMamba as a powerful tool for large-scale single-cell multi-omics
integration, capable of handling large-scale atlases and advancing biological
discovery.

Motivation: 解决在教育中平衡使用LLMs的挑战，尤其是针对学龄前儿童，避免技术误解和屏幕时间问题。

Conclusion: 该方法适合学龄前教育，未来计划在真实教育环境中进一步实验。

Abstract: Finding balanced ways to employ Large Language Models (LLMs) in education is
a challenge due to inherent risks of poor understanding of the technology and
of a susceptible audience. This is particularly so with younger children, who
are known to have difficulties with pervasive screen time. Working with a
tangible programming robot called Cubetto, we propose an approach to benefit
from the capabilities of LLMs by employing such models in the preparation of
personalised storytelling, necessary for preschool children to get accustomed
to the practice of commanding the robot. We engage in action research to
develop an early version of a formalised process to rapidly prototype game
stories for Cubetto. Our approach has both reproducible results, because it
employs open weight models, and is model-agnostic, because we test it with 5
different LLMs. We document on one hand the process, the used materials and
prompts, and on the other the learning experience and outcomes. We deem the
generation successful for the intended purposes of using the results as a
teacher aid. Testing the models on 4 different task scenarios, we encounter
issues of consistency and hallucinations and document the corresponding
evaluation process and attempts (some successful and some not) to overcome
these issues. Importantly, the process does not expose children to LLMs
directly. Rather, the technology is used to help teachers easily develop
personalised narratives on children's preferred topics. We believe our method
is adequate for preschool classes and we are planning to further experiment in
real-world educational settings.

Abstract: [Context] Machine learning (ML)-enabled systems are present in our society,
driving significant digital transformations. The dynamic nature of ML
development, characterized by experimental cycles and rapid changes in data,
poses challenges to traditional project management. Agile methods, with their

categorized recommendations and practices into eight key themes, such as
Iteration Flexibility, Innovative ML-specific Artifacts, and the Minimal Viable

retrieve information for the creation of knowledge graphs has become
increasingly urgent. The previously established Knowledge Acquisition and
Representation Methodology (KNARM) outlines a systematic approach to address
these challenges and create knowledge graphs. However, following this
methodology highlights the existing challenge of seamlessly integrating Neo4j
databases with the Web Ontology Language (OWL). Previous attempts to integrate
data from Neo4j into an ontology have been discussed, but these approaches
often require an understanding of description logics (DL) syntax, which may not
be familiar to many users. Thus, a more accessible method is necessary to
bridge this gap. This paper presents a user-friendly approach that utilizes
Python and its rdflib library to support ontology development. We showcase our
novel approach through a Neo4j database we created by integrating data from the
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS)
database. Using this dataset, we developed a Python script that automatically
generates the required classes and their axioms, facilitating a smoother
integration process. This approach offers a practical solution to the
challenges of ontology generation in the context of rapidly growing adverse
drug event datasets, supporting improved drug safety monitoring and public
health decision-making.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RAG系统在真实应用中缺乏实证研究和系统化经验总结的问题。

Method: 开发五个领域特定的RAG系统，结合多语言OCR、语义检索和领域适配LLM，通过用户评估六个维度。

Result: 用户评估显示系统在易用性、相关性等方面表现良好，总结了十二个关键经验教训。

Conclusion: RAG系统在真实应用中具有潜力，但需解决技术、操作和伦理挑战。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are emerging as a key approach
for grounding Large Language Models (LLMs) in external knowledge, addressing
limitations in factual accuracy and contextual relevance. However, there is a
lack of empirical studies that report on the development of RAG-based
implementations grounded in real-world use cases, evaluated through general
user involvement, and accompanied by systematic documentation of lessons
learned. This paper presents five domain-specific RAG applications developed
for real-world scenarios across governance, cybersecurity, agriculture,
industrial research, and medical diagnostics. Each system incorporates
multilingual OCR, semantic retrieval via vector embeddings, and domain-adapted
LLMs, deployed through local servers or cloud APIs to meet distinct user needs.
A web-based evaluation involving a total of 100 participants assessed the
systems across six dimensions: (i) Ease of Use, (ii) Relevance, (iii)
Transparency, (iv) Responsiveness, (v) Accuracy, and (vi) Likelihood of
Recommendation. Based on user feedback and our development experience, we
documented twelve key lessons learned, highlighting technical, operational, and
ethical challenges affecting the reliability and usability of RAG systems in
practice.

*Kyanna Dagenais,Istvan David*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合人类指导和强化学习的方法，用于开发复杂的模型转换序列，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动开发复杂的模型转换（MT）序列容易出错且不可行，而单纯的强化学习方法在复杂问题中性能不足。人类指导可以弥补这一缺陷。

Method: 提出了一种技术框架，将用户定义的模型转换映射到强化学习原语中，并通过执行强化学习程序寻找最优的模型转换序列。

Result: 评估表明，即使人类指导存在不确定性，也能显著提升强化学习性能，并更高效地开发复杂的模型转换序列。

Conclusion: 该方法通过权衡人类指导的确定性和及时性，为强化学习驱动的人机协同工程方法迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Model-driven engineering problems often require complex model transformations
(MTs), i.e., MTs that are chained in extensive sequences. Pertinent examples of
such problems include model synchronization, automated model repair, and design
space exploration. Manually developing complex MTs is an error-prone and often
infeasible process. Reinforcement learning (RL) is an apt way to alleviate
these issues. In RL, an autonomous agent explores the state space through trial
and error to identify beneficial sequences of actions, such as MTs. However, RL
methods exhibit performance issues in complex problems. In these situations,
human guidance can be of high utility. In this paper, we present an approach
and technical framework for developing complex MT sequences through RL, guided
by potentially uncertain human advice. Our framework allows user-defined MTs to
be mapped onto RL primitives, and executes them as RL programs to find optimal
MT sequences. Our evaluation shows that human guidance, even if uncertain,
substantially improves RL performance, and results in more efficient
development of complex MTs. Through a trade-off between the certainty and
timeliness of human advice, our method takes a step towards RL-driven
human-in-the-loop engineering methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出Synthline v1，通过改进的生成策略和优化技术生成高质量合成需求数据，解决了AI4RE领域数据稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公开标注的需求数据集稀缺阻碍了AI4RE的发展，而现有方法对生成数据质量的控制和优化研究不足。

Method: 采用多样本提示、自动提示优化（PACE）和后生成筛选技术，评估四种分类任务下的数据质量。

Result: 多样本提示显著提升数据质量和多样性；PACE优化效果因任务而异；合成数据在某些任务上优于人工数据。

Conclusion: 合成需求数据可有效缓解数据集稀缺问题，并为AI4RE提供实用解决方案。

Abstract: The shortage of publicly available, labeled requirements datasets remains a
major barrier to advancing Artificial Intelligence for Requirements Engineering
(AI4RE). While Large Language Models offer promising capabilities for synthetic
data generation, systematic approaches to control and optimize the quality of
generated requirements remain underexplored. This paper presents Synthline v1,
an enhanced Product Line approach for generating synthetic requirements data
that extends our earlier v0 version with advanced generation strategies and
curation techniques. We investigate four research questions assessing how
prompting strategies, automated prompt optimization, and post-generation
curation affect data quality across four classification tasks: defect
detection, functional vs. non-functional, quality vs. non-quality, and security
vs. non-security. Our evaluation shows that multi-sample prompting
significantly boosts both utility and diversity over single-sample generation,
with F1-score gains from 6 to 44 points. The use of PACE (Prompt Actor-Critic
Editing) for automated prompt optimization yields task-dependent results,
greatly improving functional classification (+32.5 points) but reducing
performance on others. Interestingly, similarity-based curation improves
diversity but often harms classification performance, indicating that some
redundancy may help ML models. Most importantly, our results show that
synthetic requirements can match or outperform human-authored ones for specific
tasks, with synthetic data surpassing human data for security (+7.8 points) and
defect classification (+15.4 points). These findings offer practical insights
for AI4RE and chart a viable path to mitigating dataset scarcity through
systematic synthetic generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于自动程序修复（APR）需要复杂的逻辑和多步推理能力，而现有链式思维（CoT）技术在该领域的应用不足，因此需要探索更有效的解决方案。

Method: 研究系统评估了几种常见CoT技术在APR任务中的表现，并提出$T^3$框架，结合LLMs的推理能力和树搜索技术。

Result: $T^3$显著提高了生成候选修复方案的精度，并为APR任务中的样本选择和修复策略优化提供了指导。

Conclusion: $T^3$为高效自动化调试建立了稳健的框架，展示了LLMs与树搜索结合在APR中的潜力。

Abstract: Automatic Program Repair (APR) is a core technology in software development
and maintenance, with aims to enable automated defect repair with minimal human
intervention. In recent years, the substantial advancements in Large Language
Models (LLMs) and the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques have significantly
enhanced the reasoning capabilities of these models. However, due to the
complex logic and multi-step reasoning ability needed, the application of CoT
techniques in the APR domain remains insufficient. This study systematically
evaluates the performance of several common CoT techniques in APR tasks and
proposes an innovative framework $T^3$, which integrates the powerful reasoning
capabilities of LLMs with tree search, effectively improving the precision of
generating candidate repair solutions. Furthermore, $T^3$ provides valuable
guidance for optimizing sample selection and repair strategies in APR tasks,
establishing a robust framework for achieving efficient automated debugging.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: FairyGen是一个从儿童单幅绘画自动生成故事驱动卡通视频的系统，保持其独特艺术风格。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注角色一致性和基本动作，缺乏对风格化背景生成和电影化镜头设计的支持。

Method: 结合MLLM生成结构化故事板，风格传播适配器保持视觉一致性，镜头设计模块增强多样性，3D代理重建角色运动，两阶段运动定制适配器优化动画。

Result: 系统生成风格一致、叙事结构自然、动作合理的动画视频。

Conclusion: FairyGen在个性化故事动画方面具有潜力，代码将开源。

Abstract: We propose FairyGen, an automatic system for generating story-driven cartoon
videos from a single child's drawing, while faithfully preserving its unique
artistic style. Unlike previous storytelling methods that primarily focus on
character consistency and basic motion, FairyGen explicitly disentangles
character modeling from stylized background generation and incorporates
cinematic shot design to support expressive and coherent storytelling. Given a
single character sketch, we first employ an MLLM to generate a structured
storyboard with shot-level descriptions that specify environment settings,
character actions, and camera perspectives. To ensure visual consistency, we
introduce a style propagation adapter that captures the character's visual
style and applies it to the background, faithfully retaining the character's
full visual identity while synthesizing style-consistent scenes. A shot design
module further enhances visual diversity and cinematic quality through frame
cropping and multi-view synthesis based on the storyboard. To animate the
story, we reconstruct a 3D proxy of the character to derive physically
plausible motion sequences, which are then used to fine-tune an MMDiT-based
image-to-video diffusion model. We further propose a two-stage motion
customization adapter: the first stage learns appearance features from
temporally unordered frames, disentangling identity from motion; the second
stage models temporal dynamics using a timestep-shift strategy with frozen
identity weights. Once trained, FairyGen directly renders diverse and coherent
video scenes aligned with the storyboard. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our system produces animations that are stylistically faithful,
narratively structured natural motion, highlighting its potential for
personalized and engaging story animation. The code will be available at

Motivation: 现有纹理合成方法因缺乏全局上下文和几何理解，导致纹理不一致。视频生成模型的成功启发了利用其解决纹理合成问题的思路。

Method: 提出VideoTex框架，结合几何感知条件和结构化的UV扩散策略，利用3D网格结构和语义信息生成纹理。

Result: VideoTex在纹理保真度、接缝融合和稳定性上优于现有方法，支持动态实时应用。

Conclusion: VideoTex为动态纹理合成提供了高质量且时间一致的解决方案，适用于实时应用。

Abstract: Current texture synthesis methods, which generate textures from fixed
viewpoints, suffer from inconsistencies due to the lack of global context and
geometric understanding. Meanwhile, recent advancements in video generation
models have demonstrated remarkable success in achieving temporally consistent
videos. In this paper, we introduce VideoTex, a novel framework for seamless
texture synthesis that leverages video generation models to address both
spatial and temporal inconsistencies in 3D textures. Our approach incorporates
geometry-aware conditions, enabling precise utilization of 3D mesh structures.
Additionally, we propose a structure-wise UV diffusion strategy, which enhances
the generation of occluded areas by preserving semantic information, resulting
in smoother and more coherent textures. VideoTex not only achieves smoother
transitions across UV boundaries but also ensures high-quality, temporally
stable textures across video frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
VideoTex outperforms existing methods in texture fidelity, seam blending, and
stability, paving the way for dynamic real-time applications that demand both
visual quality and temporal coherence.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于3D几何原语的场景编辑方法，通过流式生成技术实现高保真图像编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在场景编辑时难以保持纹理一致性和对象身份，需要更灵活且精确的编辑工具。

Method: 使用凸3D原语表示场景，支持不同粒度的编辑；基于深度和纹理提示的流式生成方法。

Result: 在视觉保真度、编辑灵活性和组合泛化能力上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为场景编辑提供了高效且高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: We describe Generative Blocks World to interact with the scene of a generated
image by manipulating simple geometric abstractions. Our method represents
scenes as assemblies of convex 3D primitives, and the same scene can be
represented by different numbers of primitives, allowing an editor to move
either whole structures or small details. Once the scene geometry has been
edited, the image is generated by a flow-based method which is conditioned on
depth and a texture hint. Our texture hint takes into account the modified 3D
primitives, exceeding texture-consistency provided by existing key-value
caching techniques. These texture hints (a) allow accurate object and camera
moves and (b) largely preserve the identity of objects depicted. Quantitative
and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms prior
works in visual fidelity, editability, and compositional generalization.

Conclusion: 3DGH通过分离头发和脸部建模，实现了高效的3D人头生成和编辑，为相关领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: We present 3DGH, an unconditional generative model for 3D human heads with
composable hair and face components. Unlike previous work that entangles the
modeling of hair and face, we propose to separate them using a novel data
representation with template-based 3D Gaussian Splatting, in which deformable
hair geometry is introduced to capture the geometric variations across
different hairstyles. Based on this data representation, we design a 3D
GAN-based architecture with dual generators and employ a cross-attention
mechanism to model the inherent correlation between hair and face. The model is
trained on synthetic renderings using carefully designed objectives to
stabilize training and facilitate hair-face separation. We conduct extensive
experiments to validate the design choice of 3DGH, and evaluate it both
qualitatively and quantitatively by comparing with several state-of-the-art 3D
GAN methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in unconditional full-head image
synthesis and composable 3D hairstyle editing. More details will be available

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用大型语言模型（LLM）增强图神经网络（GNN）在入侵检测中鲁棒性和泛化能力的新方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNN在网络入侵检测中表现优异，但受分布漂移和对抗攻击影响，现有评估方法不切实际。

Method: 通过LLM模拟网络安全专家，分析网络流数据中的图结构，识别并缓解对抗性扰动。

Result: 实验表明，LLM分析显著提升了GNN在对抗攻击下的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: LLM可作为入侵检测架构的补充层，提升系统整体性能。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) show great promise for Network Intrusion
Detection Systems (NIDS), particularly in IoT environments, but suffer
performance degradation due to distribution drift and lack robustness against
realistic adversarial attacks. Current robustness evaluations often rely on
unrealistic synthetic perturbations and lack demonstrations on systematic
analysis of different kinds of adversarial attack, which encompass both
black-box and white-box scenarios. This work proposes a novel approach to
enhance GNN robustness and generalization by employing Large Language Models
(LLMs) in an agentic pipeline as simulated cybersecurity expert agents. These
agents scrutinize graph structures derived from network flow data, identifying
and potentially mitigating suspicious or adversarially perturbed elements
before GNN processing. Our experiments, using a framework designed for
realistic evaluation and testing with a variety of adversarial attacks
including a dataset collected from physical testbed experiments, demonstrate
that integrating LLM analysis can significantly improve the resilience of
GNN-based NIDS against challenges, showcasing the potential of LLM agent as a
complementary layer in intrusion detection architectures.

TL;DR: ZKPROV是一个新型加密框架，通过零知识证明验证大语言模型（LLM）的数据来源，确保模型训练数据的可靠性而不泄露敏感信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在敏感领域（如医疗）部署LLM时，验证其数据来源的完整性至关重要，但传统方法计算成本高或依赖可信执行环境。

Method: ZKPROV通过零知识证明将训练模型与授权数据集绑定，利用数据集签名元数据和紧凑模型参数承诺，避免验证每一步训练过程。

Result: 实验证明ZKPROV高效且可扩展，适用于实际部署，并提供形式化安全保障。

Conclusion: ZKPROV在保护数据隐私的同时，为LLM的数据来源提供了可信且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: As the deployment of large language models (LLMs) grows in sensitive domains,
ensuring the integrity of their computational provenance becomes a critical
challenge, particularly in regulated sectors such as healthcare, where strict
requirements are applied in dataset usage. We introduce ZKPROV, a novel
cryptographic framework that enables zero-knowledge proofs of LLM provenance.
It allows users to verify that a model is trained on a reliable dataset without
revealing sensitive information about it or its parameters. Unlike prior
approaches that focus on complete verification of the training process
(incurring significant computational cost) or depend on trusted execution
environments, ZKPROV offers a distinct balance. Our method cryptographically
binds a trained model to its authorized training dataset(s) through
zero-knowledge proofs while avoiding proof of every training step. By
leveraging dataset-signed metadata and compact model parameter commitments,
ZKPROV provides sound and privacy-preserving assurances that the result of the
LLM is derived from a model trained on the claimed authorized and relevant
dataset. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of the
ZKPROV in generating this proof and verifying it, achieving a practical
solution for real-world deployments. We also provide formal security
guarantees, proving that our approach preserves dataset confidentiality while
ensuring trustworthy dataset provenance.

Conclusion: 该框架有助于农民和研究者的合作，推动农业数据的安全整合与创新。

Abstract: Data-driven agriculture, which integrates technology and data into
agricultural practices, has the potential to improve crop yield, disease
resilience, and long-term soil health. However, privacy concerns, such as
adverse pricing, discrimination, and resource manipulation, deter farmers from
sharing data, as it can be used against them. To address this barrier, we
propose a privacy-preserving framework that enables secure data sharing and
collaboration for research and development while mitigating privacy risks. The
framework combines dimensionality reduction techniques (like Principal
Component Analysis (PCA)) and differential privacy by introducing Laplacian
noise to protect sensitive information. The proposed framework allows
researchers to identify potential collaborators for a target farmer and train
personalized machine learning models either on the data of identified
collaborators via federated learning or directly on the aggregated
privacy-protected data. It also allows farmers to identify potential
collaborators based on similarities. We have validated this on real-life
datasets, demonstrating robust privacy protection against adversarial attacks
and utility performance comparable to a centralized system. We demonstrate how
this framework can facilitate collaboration among farmers and help researchers
pursue broader research objectives. The adoption of the framework can empower
researchers and policymakers to leverage agricultural data responsibly, paving
the way for transformative advances in data-driven agriculture. By addressing
critical privacy challenges, this work supports secure data integration,
fostering innovation and sustainability in agricultural systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HPC系统中的网络故障诊断因数据异构性和准确性不足而具有挑战性，现有方法无法直接应用。

Method: ClusterRCA从拓扑连接的NIC对中提取特征，结合分类器和图方法，构建故障图并进行定制随机游走以定位根因。

Result: 实验表明，ClusterRCA在HPC系统中诊断网络故障的准确性高，且在不同应用场景下性能稳健。

Conclusion: ClusterRCA为HPC系统提供了一种有效的网络故障诊断方法，具有高准确性和适应性。

Abstract: Network failure diagnosis is challenging yet critical for high-performance
computing (HPC) systems. Existing methods cannot be directly applied to HPC
scenarios due to data heterogeneity and lack of accuracy. This paper proposes a
novel framework, called ClusterRCA, to localize culprit nodes and determine
failure types by leveraging multimodal data. ClusterRCA extracts features from
topologically connected network interface controller (NIC) pairs to analyze the
diverse, multimodal data in HPC systems. To accurately localize culprit nodes
and determine failure types, ClusterRCA combines classifier-based and
graph-based approaches. A failure graph is constructed based on the output of
the state classifier, and then it performs a customized random walk on the
graph to localize the root cause. Experiments on datasets collected by a
top-tier global HPC device vendor show ClusterRCA achieves high accuracy in
diagnosing network failure for HPC systems. ClusterRCA also maintains robust
performance across different application scenarios.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: GPU内存带宽是低延迟大语言模型（LLM）推理的主要瓶颈。推测解码通过轻量级草案器提出K个令牌，LLM并行验证以提升吞吐量。然而，混合专家模型（MoE）中推测解码因权重激活增加导致数据移动和验证时间增加2-3倍，甚至可能降低性能。Cascade框架通过动态调整K值选择性启用推测解码，避免性能下降并提升吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MoE模型中推测解码因权重激活增加导致的性能下降问题，使其在实际应用中可行。

Method: 提出Cascade框架，通过轻量级指标“推测效用”动态调整K值，选择性启用推测解码。

Result: Cascade在vLLM中实现，评估显示其将性能下降限制在5%（相比1.5倍），吞吐量提升7-14%。

Conclusion: Cascade使推测解码在MoE模型中变得实用，解决了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: GPU memory bandwidth is the main bottleneck for low-latency Large Language
Model (LLM) inference. Speculative decoding leverages idle GPU compute by using
a lightweight drafter to propose K tokens, which the LLM verifies in parallel,
boosting token throughput. In conventional dense LLMs, all model weights are
fetched each iteration, so speculation adds no latency overhead. Emerging
Mixture of Experts (MoE) models activate only a subset of weights per token,
greatly reducing data movement. However, we show that speculation is
ineffective for MoEs: draft tokens collectively activate more weights,
increasing data movement and verification time by 2-3x. When token throughput
gains fail to offset this overhead, speculation causes slowdowns up to 1.5x,
making it infeasible. Even when useful, the optimal K varies by task, model,
and even between requests and iterations. Thus, despite widespread use in dense
LLMs, speculation remains impractical in leading MoEs.
  We present Cascade, a utility-driven framework that selectively enables
speculation to avoid slowdowns and dynamically tunes K to accelerate MoE
serving. Cascade uses a lightweight metric, speculation utility, the ratio of
token gains to verification cost, which shows iteration-level locality,
enabling periodic decisions via short test and longer set phases. For each
request, Cascade disables speculation if utility drops below one during
testing, and when utility exceeds one, tests multiple K-values to choose the
utility-maximizing K for the set phase. We implement Cascade in vLLM and
evaluate it on five popular MoEs with workloads spanning code, math,
extraction, and mixed tasks. Cascade limits slowdown to 5% (vs. 1.5x) and
improves throughput by 7-14% over static K, making speculative decoding
practical for MoEs.

connected nodes usually have different features or different labels. This
heterophily issue has been extensively studied in homogeneous graphs but
remains under-explored in heterogeneous graphs, where there are multiple types
of nodes and edges. Capturing node heterophily in heterogeneous graphs is very
challenging since both node/edge heterogeneity and node heterophily should be
carefully taken into consideration. Existing methods typically convert
heterogeneous graphs into homogeneous ones to learn node heterophily, which
will inevitably lose the potential heterophily conveyed by heterogeneous
relations. To bridge this gap, we propose Relation-Aware Separation of
Homophily and Heterophily (RASH), a novel contrastive learning framework that
explicitly models high-order semantics of heterogeneous interactions and
adaptively separates homophilic and heterophilic patterns. Particularly, RASH
introduces dual heterogeneous hypergraphs to encode multi-relational bipartite
subgraphs and dynamically constructs homophilic graphs and heterophilic graphs
based on relation importance. A multi-relation contrastive loss is designed to
align heterogeneous and homophilic/heterophilic views by maximizing mutual
information. In this way, RASH simultaneously resolves the challenges of
heterogeneity and heterophily in heterogeneous graphs. Extensive experiments on
benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of RASH across various
downstream tasks. The code is available at:

### [311] [Control and optimization for Neural Partial Differential Equations in Supervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20764)
*Alain Bensoussan,Minh-Binh Tran,Bangjie Wang*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的视角，将神经网络视为偏微分方程（PDEs），并探讨了在抛物型和双曲型系统中优化和控制算子系数的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文献对抛物型和双曲型系统的控制和优化问题已有研究，但对算子系数的控制和优化问题尚未深入探讨。

Method: 提出双系统公式，用于抛物型PDEs的控制和优化问题，并提供了理论证明和数值方案的基础。

Result: 证明了抛物型PDEs的控制和优化问题存在极小值，并研究了双曲型PDEs的近似控制问题的解的存在性。

Conclusion: 该研究为PDEs控制理论中的新问题提供了理论基础，并为未来高效数值方案的开发奠定了基础。

Abstract: Although there is a substantial body of literature on control and
optimization problems for parabolic and hyperbolic systems, the specific
problem of controlling and optimizing the coefficients of the associated
operators within such systems has not yet been thoroughly explored. In this
work, we aim to initiate a line of research in control theory focused on
optimizing and controlling the coefficients of these operators-a problem that
naturally arises in the context of neural networks and supervised learning.
  In supervised learning, the primary objective is to transport initial data
toward target data through the layers of a neural network. We propose a novel
perspective: neural networks can be interpreted as partial differential
equations (PDEs). From this viewpoint, the control problem traditionally
studied in the context of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is
reformulated as a control problem for PDEs, specifically targeting the
optimization and control of coefficients in parabolic and hyperbolic operators.
To the best of our knowledge, this specific problem has not yet been
systematically addressed in the control theory of PDEs.
  To this end, we propose a dual system formulation for the control and
optimization problem associated with parabolic PDEs, laying the groundwork for
the development of efficient numerical schemes in future research. We also
provide a theoretical proof showing that the control and optimization problem
for parabolic PDEs admits minimizers. Finally, we investigate the control
problem associated with hyperbolic PDEs and prove the existence of solutions
for a corresponding approximated control problem.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多链MDP的平均奖励问题因缺乏收缩性和解的非唯一性而具有挑战性，同时需要解决导航子问题以优化性能。

Method: 开发了改进的VI算法，结合折扣问题的新连接、最优固定点方法和子线性收敛率，以解决导航子问题。

Result: 获得了更快的收敛速度和更精确的复杂度度量，扩展了VI方法的理论基础。

Conclusion: 研究提升了折扣和平均奖励问题的收敛速度，并丰富了VI方法的理论框架。

Abstract: We study value-iteration (VI) algorithms for solving general (a.k.a.
multichain) Markov decision processes (MDPs) under the average-reward
criterion, a fundamental but theoretically challenging setting. Beyond the
difficulties inherent to all average-reward problems posed by the lack of
contractivity and non-uniqueness of solutions to the Bellman operator, in the
multichain setting an optimal policy must solve the navigation subproblem of
steering towards the best connected component, in addition to optimizing
long-run performance within each component. We develop algorithms which better
solve this navigational subproblem in order to achieve faster convergence for
multichain MDPs, obtaining improved rates of convergence and sharper measures
of complexity relative to prior work. Many key components of our results are of
potential independent interest, including novel connections between
average-reward and discounted problems, optimal fixed-point methods for
discounted VI which extend to general Banach spaces, new sublinear convergence
rates for the discounted value error, and refined suboptimality decompositions
for multichain MDPs. Overall our results yield faster convergence rates for
discounted and average-reward problems and expand the theoretical foundations
of VI approaches.

*Chi-Sheng Chen,Xinyu Zhang,Ya-Chuan Chen*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合量子-经典强化学习框架，用于台湾股市的板块轮动策略。量子增强模型在训练奖励上表现更好，但在实际投资指标上不如经典模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索量子计算在金融领域的应用潜力，解决强化学习在金融中奖励信号与真实目标不匹配的问题。

Method: 结合PPO算法、经典架构（LSTM、Transformer）和量子增强模型（QNN、QRWKV、QASA），并采用自动化特征工程。

Result: 量子模型训练奖励高，但实际投资表现（累计收益、夏普比率）不如经典模型。

Conclusion: 当前奖励设计可能导致过拟合短期波动，量子电路在NISQ约束下存在优化不稳定性，需改进奖励设计和模型验证。

Abstract: We propose a hybrid quantum-classical reinforcement learning framework for
sector rotation in the Taiwan stock market. Our system employs Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) as the backbone algorithm and integrates both classical
architectures (LSTM, Transformer) and quantum-enhanced models (QNN, QRWKV,
QASA) as policy and value networks. An automated feature engineering pipeline
extracts financial indicators from capital share data to ensure consistent
model input across all configurations. Empirical backtesting reveals a key
finding: although quantum-enhanced models consistently achieve higher training
rewards, they underperform classical models in real-world investment metrics
such as cumulative return and Sharpe ratio. This discrepancy highlights a core
challenge in applying reinforcement learning to financial domains -- namely,
the mismatch between proxy reward signals and true investment objectives. Our
analysis suggests that current reward designs may incentivize overfitting to
short-term volatility rather than optimizing risk-adjusted returns. This issue
is compounded by the inherent expressiveness and optimization instability of
quantum circuits under Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) constraints. We
discuss the implications of this reward-performance gap and propose directions
for future improvement, including reward shaping, model regularization, and
validation-based early stopping. Our work offers a reproducible benchmark and
critical insights into the practical challenges of deploying quantum
reinforcement learning in real-world finance.

TL;DR: 本文首次提出将脉冲神经网络（SNN）应用于合成孔径雷达（SAR）干涉相位解缠的理论框架，填补了当前方法的空白，并展示了SNN在能效和精度上的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着地球观测数据量的指数增长（如NISAR任务预计两年内生成100PB数据），能效处理对可持续数据中心运营至关重要。SNN的事件驱动计算模型有望比传统方法节省30-100倍能源。

Method: 开发了针对相位数据的脉冲编码方案，提出了利用相位解缠空间传播特性的SNN架构，并分析了计算复杂性和收敛性。

Result: SNN的时间动态特性可自然建模相位解缠的空间连续性约束，为大规模InSAR处理提供了可持续的补充方法。

Conclusion: 该工作为神经形态计算与SAR干涉测量的交叉领域开辟了新研究方向，具有潜在的重大应用价值。

Abstract: We present the first theoretical framework for applying spiking neural
networks (SNNs) to synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometric phase
unwrapping. Despite extensive research in both domains, our comprehensive
literature review confirms that SNNs have never been applied to phase
unwrapping, representing a significant gap in current methodologies. As Earth
observation data volumes continue to grow exponentially (with missions like
NISAR expected to generate 100PB in two years) energy-efficient processing
becomes critical for sustainable data center operations. SNNs, with their
event-driven computation model, offer potential energy savings of 30-100x
compared to conventional approaches while maintaining comparable accuracy. We
develop spike encoding schemes specifically designed for wrapped phase data,
propose SNN architectures that leverage the spatial propagation nature of phase
unwrapping, and provide theoretical analysis of computational complexity and
convergence properties. Our framework demonstrates how the temporal dynamics
inherent in SNNs can naturally model the spatial continuity constraints
fundamental to phase unwrapping. This work opens a new research direction at
the intersection of neuromorphic computing and SAR interferometry, offering a
complementary approach to existing algorithms that could enable more
sustainable large-scale InSAR processing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结合神经形态计算的高效时间序列处理能力和量子计算的指数级状态空间探索能力，解决现有量子脉冲模型的不足。

Method: 使用多量子比特电路实现具有内部量子记忆的脉冲单元，并通过硬件友好的局部学习规则训练SQS神经网络（SQSNN）。

Result: SQS神经元模型实现了单次事件驱动的概率脉冲生成，SQSNN无需全局经典反向传播即可训练。

Conclusion: SQS模型为模块化、可扩展且可在量子硬件上训练的量子脉冲神经网络奠定了基础。

Abstract: Neuromorphic and quantum computing have recently emerged as promising
paradigms for advancing artificial intelligence, each offering complementary
strengths. Neuromorphic systems built on spiking neurons excel at processing
time-series data efficiently through sparse, event-driven computation,
consuming energy only upon input events. Quantum computing, on the other hand,
leverages superposition and entanglement to explore feature spaces that are
exponentially large in the number of qubits. Hybrid approaches combining these
paradigms have begun to show potential, but existing quantum spiking models
have important limitations. Notably, prior quantum spiking neuron
implementations rely on classical memory mechanisms on single qubits, requiring
repeated measurements to estimate firing probabilities, and they use
conventional backpropagation on classical simulators for training. Here we
propose a stochastic quantum spiking (SQS) neuron model that addresses these
challenges. The SQS neuron uses multi-qubit quantum circuits to realize a
spiking unit with internal quantum memory, enabling event-driven probabilistic
spike generation in a single shot. Furthermore, we outline how networks of SQS
neurons -- dubbed SQS neural networks (SQSNNs) -- can be trained via a
hardware-friendly local learning rule, eliminating the need for global
classical backpropagation. The proposed SQSNN model fuses the time-series
efficiency of neuromorphic computing with the exponentially large inner state
space of quantum computing, paving the way for quantum spiking neural networks
that are modular, scalable, and trainable on quantum hardware.

Abstract: A recent survey, nicknamed "Hitchhiker's Guide", J.J. Arias-Garc{\i}a, R.
Mesiar, and B. De Baets, A hitchhiker's guide to quasi-copulas, Fuzzy Sets and
Systems 393 (2020) 1-28, has raised the rating of quasi-copula problems in the
dependence modeling community in spite of the lack of statistical
interpretation of quasi-copulas. In our previous work (arXiv:2410.19339,
accepted in Fuzzy Sets and Systems), we addressed the question of extreme
values of the mass distribution associated with multivariate quasi-copulas.
Using a linear programming approach, we were able to solve Open Problem 5 of
the "Guide" up to dimension d = 17 and disprove a recent conjecture on the
solution to that problem. In this paper, we use an analytical approach to
provide a complete answer to the original question.

Conclusion: 平坦解在高维输入下可能因神经元稀疏激活而性能不佳，首次系统性解释了平坦极小值在高维中泛化失败的原因。

Abstract: We study the implicit bias of flatness / low (loss) curvature and its effects
on generalization in two-layer overparameterized ReLU networks with
multivariate inputs -- a problem well motivated by the minima stability and
edge-of-stability phenomena in gradient-descent training. Existing work either
requires interpolation or focuses only on univariate inputs. This paper
presents new and somewhat surprising theoretical results for multivariate
inputs. On two natural settings (1) generalization gap for flat solutions, and
(2) mean-squared error (MSE) in nonparametric function estimation by stable
minima, we prove upper and lower bounds, which establish that while flatness
does imply generalization, the resulting rates of convergence necessarily
deteriorate exponentially as the input dimension grows. This gives an
exponential separation between the flat solutions vis-\`a-vis low-norm
solutions (i.e., weight decay), which knowingly do not suffer from the curse of
dimensionality. In particular, our minimax lower bound construction, based on a
novel packing argument with boundary-localized ReLU neurons, reveals how flat
solutions can exploit a kind of ''neural shattering'' where neurons rarely
activate, but with high weight magnitudes. This leads to poor performance in
high dimensions. We corroborate these theoretical findings with extensive
numerical simulations. To the best of our knowledge, our analysis provides the
first systematic explanation for why flat minima may fail to generalize in high
dimensions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统高斯或vMF潜在分布在表示方向性数据时存在局限性，且vMF因涉及贝塞尔函数计算而数值不稳定。spCauchy提供了一种更灵活且稳定的替代方案。

Method: 采用spCauchy潜在分布，利用Möbius变换实现高效可微分的重参数化技巧，并通过快速收敛的幂级数计算KL散度。

Result: spCauchy避免了vMF的数值不稳定问题，提供了更高效的潜在空间利用和更具表达力的表示。

Conclusion: spCauchy是一种理论优势与实践效率兼具的VAE潜在分布选择，适用于高维生成建模。

Abstract: We propose a novel variational autoencoder (VAE) architecture that employs a
spherical Cauchy (spCauchy) latent distribution. Unlike traditional Gaussian
latent spaces or the widely used von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution, spCauchy
provides a more natural hyperspherical representation of latent variables,
better capturing directional data while maintaining flexibility. Its
heavy-tailed nature prevents over-regularization, ensuring efficient latent
space utilization while offering a more expressive representation.
Additionally, spCauchy circumvents the numerical instabilities inherent to vMF,
which arise from computing normalization constants involving Bessel functions.
Instead, it enables a fully differentiable and efficient reparameterization
trick via M\"obius transformations, allowing for stable and scalable training.
The KL divergence can be computed through a rapidly converging power series,
eliminating concerns of underflow or overflow associated with evaluation of
ratios of hypergeometric functions. These properties make spCauchy a compelling
alternative for VAEs, offering both theoretical advantages and practical
efficiency in high-dimensional generative modeling.

Conclusion: 放宽假设会导致因果图学习的等价类规模显著增大，限制了仅从观测数据中恢复因果图的能力。

Abstract: Causal discovery algorithms typically recover causal graphs only up to their
Markov equivalence classes unless additional parametric assumptions are made.
The sizes of these equivalence classes reflect the limits of what can be
learned about the underlying causal graph from purely observational data. Under
the assumptions of acyclicity, causal sufficiency, and a uniform model prior,
Markov equivalence classes are known to be small on average. In this paper, we
show that this is no longer the case when any of these assumptions is relaxed.
Specifically, we prove exponentially large lower bounds for the expected size
of Markov equivalence classes in three settings: sparse random directed acyclic
graphs, uniformly random acyclic directed mixed graphs, and uniformly random
directed cyclic graphs.

Result: 在中东和美国的冲突动态预测中，STFT-VNNGP在长期预测中表现优于单独使用TFT。

Conclusion: STFT-VNNGP为从复杂事件数据中生成可靠情报提供了框架，代码公开以确保可重复性。

Abstract: Forecasting geopolitical conflict from data sources like the Global Database
of Events, Language, and Tone (GDELT) is a critical challenge for national
security. The inherent sparsity, burstiness, and overdispersion of such data
cause standard deep learning models, including the Temporal Fusion Transformer
(TFT), to produce unreliable long-horizon predictions. We introduce STFT-VNNGP,
a hybrid architecture that won the 2023 Algorithms for Threat Detection (ATD)
competition by overcoming these limitations. Designed to bridge this gap, our
model employs a two-stage process: first, a TFT captures complex temporal
dynamics to generate multi-quantile forecasts. These quantiles then serve as
informed inputs for a Variational Nearest Neighbor Gaussian Process (VNNGP),
which performs principled spatiotemporal smoothing and uncertainty
quantification. In a case study forecasting conflict dynamics in the Middle
East and the U.S., STFT-VNNGP consistently outperforms a standalone TFT,
showing a superior ability to predict the timing and magnitude of bursty event
periods, particularly at long-range horizons. This work offers a robust
framework for generating more reliable and actionable intelligence from
challenging event data, with all code and workflows made publicly available to

Conclusion: 该方法为多智能体强化学习提供了一种可扩展且理论支持的近似框架。

Abstract: This paper introduces a new approach for approximating the learning dynamics
of multiple reinforcement learning (RL) agents interacting in a finite-state
Markov game. The idea is to rescale the learning process by simultaneously
reducing the learning rate and increasing the update frequency, effectively
treating the agent's parameters as a slow-evolving variable influenced by the
fast-mixing game state. Under mild assumptions-ergodicity of the state process
and continuity of the updates-we prove the convergence of this rescaled process
to an ordinary differential equation (ODE). This ODE provides a tractable,
deterministic approximation of the agent's learning dynamics. An implementation

Abstract: We describe and analyze a computionally efficient refitting procedure for
computing high-probability upper bounds on the instance-wise mean-squared
prediction error of penalized nonparametric estimates based on least-squares
minimization. Requiring only a single dataset and black box access to the
prediction method, it consists of three steps: computing suitable residuals,
symmetrizing and scaling them with a pre-factor $\rho$, and using them to
define and solve a modified prediction problem recentered at the current
estimate. We refer to it as wild refitting, since it uses Rademacher residual
symmetrization as in a wild bootstrap variant. Under relatively mild conditions
allowing for noise heterogeneity, we establish a high probability guarantee on
its performance, showing that the wild refit with a suitably chosen wild noise
scale $\rho$ gives an upper bound on prediction error. This theoretical
analysis provides guidance into the design of such procedures, including how
the residuals should be formed, the amount of noise rescaling in the wild
sub-problem needed for upper bounds, and the local stability properties of the
block-box procedure. We illustrate the applicability of this procedure to
various problems, including non-rigid structure-from-motion recovery with
structured matrix penalties; plug-and-play image restoration with deep neural
network priors; and randomized sketching with kernel methods.

Abstract: We develop sampling methods, which consist of Gaussian invariant versions of
random walk Metropolis (RWM), Metropolis adjusted Langevin algorithm (MALA) and
second order Hessian or Manifold MALA. Unlike standard RWM and MALA we show
that Gaussian invariant sampling can lead to ergodic estimators with improved
statistical efficiency. This is due to a remarkable property of Gaussian
invariance that allows us to obtain exact analytical solutions to the Poisson
equation for Gaussian targets. These solutions can be used to construct
efficient and easy to use control variates for variance reduction of estimators
under any intractable target. We demonstrate the new samplers and estimators in
several examples, including high dimensional targets in latent Gaussian models
where we compare against several advanced methods and obtain state-of-the-art
results. We also provide theoretical results regarding geometric ergodicity,
and an optimal scaling analysis that shows the dependence of the optimal
acceptance rate on the Gaussianity of the target.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习在结构材料研究中应用广泛，但如何整合现有数据并量化预测模型中的不确定性仍需探索。

Method: 使用混合密度网络（MDN）模型，基于文献中的实验数据，预测位错密度分布和应力分布，并结合位错介导的塑性模型进行应力-应变预测。

Result: 该方法提高了机械性能预测的准确性和可靠性，并实现了不确定性量化。

Conclusion: 该策略不仅优化了合金设计，还为快速发展的材料行业提供了新材料的开发支持。

Abstract: Machine learning has significantly advanced the understanding and application
of structural materials, with an increasing emphasis on integrating existing
data and quantifying uncertainties in predictive modeling. This study presents
a comprehensive methodology utilizing a mixed density network (MDN) model,
trained on extensive experimental data from literature. This approach uniquely
predicts the distribution of dislocation density, inferred as a latent
variable, and the resulting stress distribution at the grain level. The
incorporation of statistical parameters of those predicted distributions into a
dislocation-mediated plasticity model allows for accurate stress-strain
predictions with explicit uncertainty quantification. This strategy not only
improves the accuracy and reliability of mechanical property predictions but
also plays a vital role in optimizing alloy design, thereby facilitating the
development of new materials in a rapidly evolving industry.

### [327] [RAG-VisualRec: An Open Resource for Vision- and Text-Enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation in Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20817)
*Ali Tourani,Fatemeh Nazary,Yashar Deldjoo*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合LLM生成的剧情描述和预告片视觉嵌入的多模态推荐系统，通过数据增强和融合策略提升推荐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决电影推荐系统中因元数据有限而难以生成高质量推荐的问题。

Method: 结合LLM生成的文本和视觉嵌入，采用数据增强和融合策略（如PCA、CCA），并引入LLM驱动的重排序步骤。

Result: CCA融合显著提升召回率，LLM重排序进一步改善NDCG，尤其在文本数据有限的情况下效果显著。

Conclusion: 该框架为多模态推荐技术提供了新思路，适用于冷启动、新颖性和特定领域场景，所有资源已开源。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of developing multimodal recommender
systems for the movie domain, where limited metadata (e.g., title, genre) often
hinders the generation of robust recommendations. We introduce a resource that
combines LLM-generated plot descriptions with trailer-derived visual embeddings
in a unified pipeline supporting both Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and
collaborative filtering. Central to our approach is a data augmentation step
that transforms sparse metadata into richer textual signals, alongside fusion
strategies (e.g., PCA, CCA) that integrate visual cues. Experimental
evaluations demonstrate that CCA-based fusion significantly boosts recall
compared to unimodal baselines, while an LLM-driven re-ranking step further
improves NDCG, particularly in scenarios with limited textual data. By
releasing this framework, we invite further exploration of multi-modal
recommendation techniques tailored to cold-start, novelty-focused, and
domain-specific settings. All code, data, and detailed documentation are
publicly available at: https://github.com/RecSys-lab/RAG-VisualRec

TL;DR: EraRAG是一种新型的多层Graph-RAG框架，通过分层图结构和局部敏感哈希（LSH）实现高效动态更新，显著减少更新时间和资源消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Graph-RAG方法假设静态语料库，动态更新成本高，限制了其在动态环境中的可扩展性。

Method: 利用基于超平面的LSH将语料库分层组织为图结构，支持高效局部插入新数据，避免全局重构。

Result: 在大规模基准测试中，EraRAG更新时间和令牌消耗减少一个数量级，同时保持高检索精度和低延迟。

Conclusion: EraRAG为持续增长的语料库提供了一种高效的RAG解决方案，平衡了检索效率和适应性。

Abstract: Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph-RAG) enhances large
language models (LLMs) by structuring retrieval over an external corpus.
However, existing approaches typically assume a static corpus, requiring
expensive full-graph reconstruction whenever new documents arrive, limiting
their scalability in dynamic, evolving environments. To address these
limitations, we introduce EraRAG, a novel multi-layered Graph-RAG framework
that supports efficient and scalable dynamic updates. Our method leverages
hyperplane-based Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) to partition and organize the
original corpus into hierarchical graph structures, enabling efficient and
localized insertions of new data without disrupting the existing topology. The
design eliminates the need for retraining or costly recomputation while
preserving high retrieval accuracy and low latency. Experiments on large-scale
benchmarks demonstrate that EraRag achieves up to an order of magnitude
reduction in update time and token consumption compared to existing Graph-RAG
systems, while providing superior accuracy performance. This work offers a
practical path forward for RAG systems that must operate over continually
growing corpora, bridging the gap between retrieval efficiency and
adaptability. Our code and data are available at

### [330] [CodecSlime: Temporal Redundancy Compression of Neural Speech Codec via Dynamic Frame Rate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21074)
*Hankun Wang,Yiwei Guo,Chongtian Shao,Bohan Li,Xie Chen,Kai Yu*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: CodecSlime是一种支持动态帧率（DFR）的神经语音编解码器插件方法，通过减少冗余信息显著提升压缩效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统固定帧率（FFR）编解码器在语音信息密度不均匀时浪费资源，CodecSlime旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 结合ScheDFR和Melt-and-Cool两种创新技术，实现无监督和架构无关的动态帧率支持。

Result: 在40Hz DFR下，重建WER相对FFR基线降低46%，同时支持多帧率推理。

Conclusion: CodecSlime在压缩质量和比特率之间提供灵活权衡，显著优于传统方法。

Abstract: Neural speech codecs have been widely used in audio compression and various
downstream tasks. Current mainstream codecs are fixed-frame-rate (FFR), which
allocate the same number of tokens to every equal-duration slice. However,
speech is inherently non-uniform in temporal information density. As a result,
many tokens are wasted on steady-state segments like long vowels and silences.
To address this mismatch, we present CodecSlime, a plugin-style method for
compressing temporal redundancy through supporting dynamic frame rate (DFR) on
neural speech codecs for the first time. Our method is unsupervised and
architecture-agnostic, combining two key innovations, ScheDFR and
Melt-and-Cool, for adapting inference and training, respectively. When
integrated into a typical VQ-GAN codec backbone and operating at 40 Hz DFR
($\approx$ 600 bps), the reconstruction WER of CodecSlime is reduced by up to
46% relative to conventional FFR baselines with the same model architecture and
similar bitrates, while other metrics are also competitive. CodecSlime also
enables flexible trade-offs between reconstruction quality and bitrate: a
single model supports inference at multiple frame rates and consistently
outperforms FFR models at the corresponding frame rates. Audio samples are
available at https://acadarmeria.github.io/codecslime/.

### [331] [Hybrid Deep Learning and Signal Processing for Arabic Dialect Recognition in Low-Resource Settings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21386)
*Ghazal Al-Shwayyat,Omer Nezih Gerek*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 研究探讨了结合传统信号处理技术和深度学习架构的混合模型，用于低资源场景下的阿拉伯方言识别。MFCC + CNN模型表现最佳，准确率达91.2%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿拉伯方言识别因语言多样性和标注数据稀缺而具有挑战性，尤其在低资源场景下。

Method: 开发了两种混合模型：MFCC + CNN和DWT + RNN，并在Common Voice阿拉伯数据集上评估。

Result: MFCC + CNN模型准确率91.2%，显著优于DWT + RNN的66.5%。

Conclusion: 研究为低资源环境下的阿拉伯方言识别提供了基准，并建议未来采用更大标注数据集和自监督学习技术。

Abstract: Arabic dialect recognition presents a significant challenge in speech
technology due to the linguistic diversity of Arabic and the scarcity of large
annotated datasets, particularly for underrepresented dialects. This research
investigates hybrid modeling strategies that integrate classical signal
processing techniques with deep learning architectures to address this problem
in low-resource scenarios. Two hybrid models were developed and evaluated: (1)
Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) combined with a Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN), and (2) Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) features combined with
a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The models were trained on a dialect-filtered
subset of the Common Voice Arabic dataset, with dialect labels assigned based
on speaker metadata. Experimental results demonstrate that the MFCC + CNN
architecture achieved superior performance, with an accuracy of 91.2% and
strong precision, recall, and F1-scores, significantly outperforming the
Wavelet + RNN configuration, which achieved an accuracy of 66.5%. These
findings highlight the effectiveness of leveraging spectral features with
convolutional models for Arabic dialect recognition, especially when working
with limited labeled data. The study also identifies limitations related to
dataset size, potential regional overlaps in labeling, and model optimization,
providing a roadmap for future research. Recommendations for further
improvement include the adoption of larger annotated corpora, integration of
self-supervised learning techniques, and exploration of advanced neural
architectures such as Transformers. Overall, this research establishes a strong
baseline for future developments in Arabic dialect recognition within
resource-constrained environments.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: ThinkSound 是一个基于 Chain-of-Thought (CoT) 推理的视频到音频生成框架，通过分阶段生成和编辑音频，结合多模态大语言模型，实现了高保真音频生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前端到端视频到音频生成方法难以捕捉视觉内容的细微差别，需要更复杂的推理能力。

Method: ThinkSound 将音频生成分解为三个阶段：基础音效生成、交互式对象中心细化、自然语言指导的编辑，并利用多模态大语言模型生成 CoT 推理。

Result: ThinkSound 在视频到音频生成任务中达到了最先进的性能，并在 Movie Gen Audio 基准测试中表现出色。

Conclusion: ThinkSound 通过分阶段推理和交互式编辑，显著提升了视频到音频生成的质量和灵活性。

Abstract: While end-to-end video-to-audio generation has greatly improved, producing
high-fidelity audio that authentically captures the nuances of visual content
remains challenging. Like professionals in the creative industries, such
generation requires sophisticated reasoning about items such as visual
dynamics, acoustic environments, and temporal relationships. We present
\textbf{ThinkSound}, a novel framework that leverages Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning to enable stepwise, interactive audio generation and editing for
videos. Our approach decomposes the process into three complementary stages:
foundational foley generation that creates semantically coherent soundscapes,
interactive object-centric refinement through precise user interactions, and
targeted editing guided by natural language instructions. At each stage, a
multimodal large language model generates contextually aligned CoT reasoning
that guides a unified audio foundation model. Furthermore, we introduce
\textbf{AudioCoT}, a comprehensive dataset with structured reasoning
annotations that establishes connections between visual content, textual
descriptions, and sound synthesis. Experiments demonstrate that ThinkSound
achieves state-of-the-art performance in video-to-audio generation across both
audio metrics and CoT metrics and excels in out-of-distribution Movie Gen Audio
benchmark. The demo page is available at https://ThinkSound-Demo.github.io.

TL;DR: 该技术报告介绍了DCASE 2025挑战赛任务4的提交系统，通过结合额外的音频特征和改进标签校正系统，显著提升了音频分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混合音频中的细微线索难以仅通过梅尔频谱捕捉，需要额外特征提供补充视角。

Method: 结合频谱滚降和色度特征，应用基于代理的标签校正系统，并优化训练数据集。

Result: 实验表明，CA-SDRi指标相对基线提升了14.7%。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效提升了音频分类性能，尤其在复杂场景中表现优异。

Abstract: This technical report presents submission systems for Task 4 of the DCASE
2025 Challenge. This model incorporates additional audio features (spectral
roll-off and chroma features) into the embedding feature extracted from the
mel-spectral feature to im-prove the classification capabilities of an
audio-tagging model in the spatial semantic segmentation of sound scenes (S5)
system. This approach is motivated by the fact that mixed audio often contains
subtle cues that are difficult to capture with mel-spectrograms alone. Thus,
these additional features offer alterna-tive perspectives for the model.
Second, an agent-based label correction system is applied to the outputs
processed by the S5 system. This system reduces false positives, improving the
final class-aware signal-to-distortion ratio improvement (CA-SDRi) metric.
Finally, we refine the training dataset to enhance the classi-fication accuracy
of low-performing classes by removing irrele-vant samples and incorporating
external data. That is, audio mix-tures are generated from a limited number of
data points; thus, even a small number of out-of-class data points could
degrade model performance. The experiments demonstrate that the submit-ted
systems employing these approaches relatively improve CA-SDRi by up to 14.7%
compared to the baseline of DCASE 2025 Challenge Task 4.

Motivation: 探索TFT在降雨径流建模中的优势，并与LSTM进行比较，以改进水文模型和理解。

Method: 训练10个随机初始化的TFT和LSTM模型，应用于531个CAMELS流域和5个Caravan子数据集，评估性能、流域属性影响及数据集差异。

Result: TFT略优于LSTM，尤其在模拟水文图中段和峰值时，且能处理更长序列。TFT的可解释性提供了科学洞察。两者在Caravan数据集上性能下降。

Conclusion: TFT在水文建模中具有潜力，尤其在处理长序列和大流域时，但其性能受数据质量影响。

Abstract: Combining attention with recurrence has shown to be valuable in sequence
modeling, including hydrological predictions. Here, we explore the strength of
Temporal Fusion Transformers (TFTs) over Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks
in rainfall-runoff modeling. We train ten randomly initialized models, TFT and
LSTM, for 531 CAMELS catchments in the US. We repeat the experiment with five
subsets of the Caravan dataset, each representing catchments in the US,
Australia, Brazil, Great Britain, and Chile. Then, the performance of the
models, their variability regarding the catchment attributes, and the
difference according to the datasets are assessed. Our findings show that TFT
slightly outperforms LSTM, especially in simulating the midsection and peak of
hydrographs. Furthermore, we show the ability of TFT to handle longer sequences
and why it can be a better candidate for higher or larger catchments. Being an
explainable AI technique, TFT identifies the key dynamic and static variables,
providing valuable scientific insights. However, both TFT and LSTM exhibit a
considerable drop in performance with the Caravan dataset, indicating possible
data quality issues. Overall, the study highlights the potential of TFT in
improving hydrological modeling and understanding.

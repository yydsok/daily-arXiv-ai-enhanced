These examples\nfail to account for both model-specific knowledge distributions and the\nintrinsic complexity of the tasks, resulting in suboptimal and unstable model\nperformance. To address this, we propose a novel framework inspired by the\npedagogical principle of \"tailored teaching with balanced difficulty\". We\nreframe prompt selection as a prompt curriculum design problem: constructing a\nwell ordered set of training examples that align with the model's current\ncapabilities. Our approach integrates two complementary signals: (1)\nmodel-perceived difficulty, quantified through prediction disagreement in an\nactive learning setup, capturing what the model itself finds challenging; and\n(2) intrinsic sample complexity, which measures the inherent difficulty of each\nquestion-image pair independently of any model. By jointly analyzing these\nsignals, we develop a difficulty-balanced sampling strategy that ensures the\nselected prompt examples are diverse across both dimensions. Extensive\nexperiments conducted on five challenging benchmarks and multiple popular\nMultimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate that our method yields\nsubstantial and consistent improvements and greatly reduces performance\ndiscrepancies caused by random sampling, providing a principled and robust\napproach for enhancing multimodal reasoning."}

To support research in this area, we\nintroduce a novel dataset comprising 10,210 images of vehicles with 12,687\nannotated LPs for legibility classification (the LPLC dataset). The images span\na wide range of vehicle types, lighting conditions, and camera/image quality\nlevels. We adopt a fine-grained annotation strategy that includes vehicle- and\nLP-level occlusions, four legibility categories (perfect, good, poor, and\nillegible), and character labels for three categories (excluding illegible\nLPs). As a benchmark, we propose a classification task using three image\nrecognition networks to determine whether an LP image is good enough, requires\nsuper-resolution, or is completely unrecoverable. The overall F1 score, which\nremained below 80% for all three baseline models (ViT, ResNet, and YOLO),\ntogether with the analyses of SR and LP recognition methods, highlights the\ndifficulty of the task and reinforces the need for further research. The\nproposed dataset is publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/lmlwojcik/lplc-dataset."}

We carefully construct a fully-automatic pipeline for data\npreparation, which simulates a large-scale paired dataset with diverse scenes,\nobjects, shooting angles, and camera trajectories. ROSE is implemented as an\nvideo inpainting model built on diffusion transformer. To localize all\nobject-correlated areas, the entire video is fed into the model for\nreference-based erasing. Moreover, additional supervision is introduced to\nexplicitly predict the areas affected by side effects, which can be revealed\nthrough the differential mask between the paired videos. To fully investigate\nthe model performance on various side effect removal, we presents a new\nbenchmark, dubbed ROSE-Bench, incorporating both common scenarios and the five\nspecial side effects for comprehensive evaluation. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that ROSE achieves superior performance compared to existing video\nobject erasing models and generalizes well to real-world video scenarios.

This naturally raises an important question: can\ngeneral-purpose standalone VLMs effectively solve HOI detection, and how do\nthey compare with specialized HOI methods? Answering this requires a benchmark\nthat can accommodate both paradigms. However, existing HOI benchmarks such as\nHICO-DET were developed before the emergence of modern VLMs, and their\nevaluation protocols require exact matches to annotated HOI classes. This is\npoorly aligned with the generative nature of VLMs, which often yield multiple\nvalid interpretations in ambiguous cases. For example, a static image may\ncapture a person mid-motion with a frisbee, which can plausibly be interpreted\nas either \"throwing\" or \"catching\".

While current evaluation efforts for RAG systems have\nprimarily focused on the development of performance metrics, far less attention\nhas been given to the design and quality of the underlying evaluation datasets,\ndespite their pivotal role in enabling meaningful, reliable assessments. In\nthis work, we introduce a novel multi-agent framework for generating synthetic\nQA datasets for RAG evaluation that prioritize semantic diversity and privacy\npreservation. Our approach involves: (1) a Diversity agent leveraging\nclustering techniques to maximize topical coverage and semantic variability,\n(2) a Privacy Agent that detects and mask sensitive information across multiple\ndomains and (3) a QA curation agent that synthesizes private and diverse QA\npairs suitable as ground truth for RAG evaluation.

We found that all\nmodels measure constant and dependent covariance equally well, depending on the\nstrength of the covariance, but the models all falsely detect that dependent\ncovariance is present for data where constant covariance is present.

The majority of\ncurrent approaches for roof plane segmentation rely on the manually designed or\nlearned features followed by some specifically designed geometric clustering\nstrategies. Because the learned features are more powerful than the manually\ndesigned features, the deep learning-based approaches usually perform better\nthan the traditional approaches. However, the current deep learning-based\napproaches have three unsolved problems. The first is that most of them are not\ntruly end-to-end, the plane segmentation results may be not optimal. The second\nis that the point feature discriminability near the edges is relatively low,\nleading to inaccurate planar edges. The third is that the planar geometric\ncharacteristics are not sufficiently considered to constrain the network\ntraining. To solve these issues, a novel edge-aware transformer-based network,\nnamed RoofSeg, is developed for segmenting roof planes from LiDAR point clouds\nin a truly end-to-end manner. In the RoofSeg, we leverage a transformer\nencoder-decoder-based framework to hierarchically predict the plane instance\nmasks with the use of a set of learnable plane queries. To further improve the\nsegmentation accuracy of edge regions, we also design an Edge-Aware Mask Module\n(EAMM) that sufficiently incorporates planar geometric prior of edges to\nenhance its discriminability for plane instance mask refinement. In addition,\nwe propose an adaptive weighting strategy in the mask loss to reduce the\ninfluence of misclassified points, and also propose a new plane geometric loss\nto constrain the network training."}

In\nthis work, we aim to bridge this gap and present a method that directly\ngenerates large-scale 3D driving scenes with accurate geometry, allowing for\ncausal novel view synthesis with object permanence and explicit 3D geometry\nestimation. The proposed method combines the generation of a proxy geometry and\nenvironment representation with score distillation from learned 2D image\npriors.

In response, educational efforts have\nincreasingly embraced artificial-intelligence (AI)-powered digital learning\nenvironments, ranging from educational apps and virtual labs to serious games.\nRecent advances in large language models (LLMs) and neuro-symbolic systems,\nmeanwhile, offer a transformative opportunity to reimagine how support is\ndelivered in digital learning environments. LLMs are enabling socially\ninteractive learning experiences and scalable, cross-domain learning support\nthat can adapt instructional strategies across varied subjects and contexts. In\nparallel, neuro-symbolic AI provides new avenues for designing these agents\nthat are not only adaptive but also scalable across domains. Based on these\nremarks, this paper presents a multi-agent, neuro-symbolic framework designed\nto resolve the aforementioned challenges. The framework assigns distinct\npedagogical roles to specialized agents: an RL-based 'tutor' agent provides\nauthoritative, non-verbal scaffolding, while a proactive, LLM-powered 'peer'\nagent facilitates the social dimensions of learning. While prior work has\nexplored such agents in isolation, our framework's novelty lies in unifying\nthem through a central educational ontology.

However, trade-offs often arise when optimizing for multiple\nrewards or combining multiple models, as they can often represent competing\nproperties. Existing methods cannot guarantee that the resulting model\nfaithfully generates samples with all the desired properties.

Given a 3D model, VoxHammer\nfirst predicts its inversion trajectory and obtains its inverted latents and\nkey-value tokens at each timestep. Subsequently, in the denoising and editing\nphase, we replace the denoising features of preserved regions with the\ncorresponding inverted latents and cached key-value tokens. By retaining these\ncontextual features, this approach ensures consistent reconstruction of\npreserved areas and coherent integration of edited parts. To evaluate the\nconsistency of preserved regions, we constructed Edit3D-Bench, a\nhuman-annotated dataset comprising hundreds of samples, each with carefully\nlabeled 3D editing regions. Experiments demonstrate that VoxHammer\nsignificantly outperforms existing methods in terms of both 3D consistency of\npreserved regions and overall quality. Our method holds promise for\nsynthesizing high-quality edited paired data, thereby laying the data\nfoundation for in-context 3D generation.

Although promising results are achieved\nvia experimental analysis, an in-depth understanding of the LLM's internal\nworkings is unavoidable to comprehend the reasoning behind the re-ranking,\nwhich provides end users with an explanation that enables them to make an\ninformed decision. Moreover, in newly developed systems with limited user\nengagement and insufficient ranking data, accurately re-ranking content remains\na significant challenge. While various training methods affect the training of\nLLMs and generate inference, our analysis has found that some training methods\nexhibit better explainability than others, implying that an accurate semantic\nunderstanding has not been learned through all training methods; instead,\nabstract knowledge has been gained to optimize evaluation, which raises\nquestions about the true reliability of LLMs. Therefore, in this work, we\nanalyze how different training methods affect the semantic understanding of the\nre-ranking task in LLMs and investigate whether these models can generate more\ninformed textual reasoning to overcome the challenges of transparency or LLMs\nand limited training data. To analyze the LLMs for re-ranking tasks, we utilize\na relatively small ranking dataset from the environment and the Earth science\ndomain to re-rank retrieved content.

A few end-to-end systems have since been proposed, but they have yet\nto match the forecast skill of state-of-the-art NWP competitors. In this work,\nwe propose Huracan, an observation-driven weather forecasting system which\ncombines an ensemble data assimilation model with a forecast model to produce\nhighly accurate forecasts relying only on observations as inputs. Huracan is\nnot only the first to provide ensemble initial conditions and end-to-end\nensemble weather forecasts, but also the first end-to-end system to achieve an\naccuracy comparable with that of ECMWF ENS, the state-of-the-art NWP\ncompetitor, despite using a smaller amount of available observation data.\nNotably, Huracan matches or exceeds the continuous ranked probability score of\nECMWF ENS on 75.4% of the variable and lead time combinations.

Our approach integrates two complementary signals: (1)\nmodel-perceived difficulty, quantified through prediction disagreement in an\nactive learning setup, capturing what the model itself finds challenging; and\n(2) intrinsic sample complexity, which measures the inherent difficulty of each\nquestion-image pair independently of any model. By jointly analyzing these\nsignals, we develop a difficulty-balanced sampling strategy that ensures the\nselected prompt examples are diverse across both dimensions. Extensive\nexperiments conducted on five challenging benchmarks and multiple popular\nMultimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate that our method yields\nsubstantial and consistent improvements and greatly reduces performance\ndiscrepancies caused by random sampling, providing a principled and robust\napproach for enhancing multimodal reasoning."}

Because the learned features are more powerful than the manually\ndesigned features, the deep learning-based approaches usually perform better\nthan the traditional approaches.

To solve these issues, a novel edge-aware transformer-based network,\nnamed RoofSeg, is developed for segmenting roof planes from LiDAR point clouds\nin a truly end-to-end manner.

To tackle these challenges,\nwe introduce HiPlan, a hierarchical planning framework that provides adaptive\nglobal-local guidance to boost LLM-based agents'decision-making. HiPlan\ndecomposes complex tasks into milestone action guides for general direction and\nstep-wise hints for detailed actions. During the offline phase, we construct a\nmilestone library from expert demonstrations, enabling structured experience\nreuse by retrieving semantically similar tasks and milestones. In the execution\nphase, trajectory segments from past milestones are dynamically adapted to\ngenerate step-wise hints that align current observations with the milestone\nobjectives, bridging gaps and correcting deviations. Extensive experiments\nacross two challenging benchmarks demonstrate that HiPlan substantially\noutperforms strong baselines, and ablation studies validate the complementary\nbenefits of its hierarchical components."}

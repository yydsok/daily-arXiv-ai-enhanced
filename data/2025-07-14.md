<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决表问答任务中因大规模、不完整列语义和实体歧义带来的挑战。

Method: 提出TableReasoner框架，结合结构和语义表示建模表，设计多步模式链接计划以聚焦查询相关信息，并集成迭代思考架构。

Result: 在SemEval-2025 Task 8的两个子任务中均获得第一名。

Conclusion: TableReasoner通过结合LLM和编程，有效解决了TQA任务中的挑战，并取得了显著成果。

Abstract: The paper presents our system developed for table question answering (TQA).
TQA tasks face challenges due to the characteristics of real-world tabular
data, such as large size, incomplete column semantics, and entity ambiguity. To
address these issues, we propose a large language model (LLM)-powered and
programming-based table reasoning framework, named TableReasoner. It models a
table using the schema that combines structural and semantic representations,
enabling holistic understanding and efficient processing of large tables. We
design a multi-step schema linking plan to derive a focused table schema that
retains only query-relevant information, eliminating ambiguity and alleviating
hallucinations. This focused table schema provides precise and sufficient table
details for query refinement and programming. Furthermore, we integrate the
reasoning workflow into an iterative thinking architecture, allowing
incremental cycles of thinking, reasoning and reflection. Our system achieves
first place in both subtasks of SemEval-2025 Task 8.

### [3] [A Dynamic Stackelberg Game Framework for Agentic AI Defense Against LLM Jailbreaking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08207)
*Zhengye Han,Quanyan Zhu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种动态Stackelberg博弈框架来建模LLM越狱攻击中的攻防交互，并引入了一种名为“紫色代理”的新型AI解决方案，结合RRT技术主动防御。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在关键应用中的部署增加，越狱攻击（绕过安全机制）成为重要问题，需要有效的防御方法。

Method: 采用Stackelberg博弈框架建模攻防交互，提出“紫色代理”结合RRT技术模拟攻击轨迹并主动干预。

Result: 该方法为分析对抗动态提供了原则性方法，并有效降低了越狱风险。

Conclusion: 动态博弈框架和紫色代理为LLM安全防御提供了新思路和实用工具。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in critical
applications, the challenge of jailbreaking, where adversaries manipulate the
models to bypass safety mechanisms, has become a significant concern. This
paper presents a dynamic Stackelberg game framework to model the interactions
between attackers and defenders in the context of LLM jailbreaking. The
framework treats the prompt-response dynamics as a sequential extensive-form
game, where the defender, as the leader, commits to a strategy while
anticipating the attacker's optimal responses. We propose a novel agentic AI
solution, the "Purple Agent," which integrates adversarial exploration and
defensive strategies using Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT). The Purple
Agent actively simulates potential attack trajectories and intervenes
proactively to prevent harmful outputs. This approach offers a principled
method for analyzing adversarial dynamics and provides a foundation for
mitigating the risk of jailbreaking.

### [4] [Reasoning and Behavioral Equilibria in LLM-Nash Games: From Mindsets to Actions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08208)
*Quanyan Zhu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM-Nash框架通过游戏理论模型研究基于大型语言模型（LLM）的决策，关注有限理性下的推理均衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统博弈论假设完全理性，而LLM-Nash框架旨在捕捉有限理性，通过显式建模推理过程。

Method: 在提示空间中定义均衡，行为由LLM推理输出决定。

Result: 推理均衡可能与传统纳什均衡不同，为LLM系统提供新的战略交互基础。

Conclusion: LLM-Nash框架为研究认知约束和战略交互提供了新视角。

Abstract: We introduce the LLM-Nash framework, a game-theoretic model where agents
select reasoning prompts to guide decision-making via Large Language Models
(LLMs). Unlike classical games that assume utility-maximizing agents with full
rationality, this framework captures bounded rationality by modeling the
reasoning process explicitly. Equilibrium is defined over the prompt space,
with actions emerging as the behavioral output of LLM inference. This approach
enables the study of cognitive constraints, mindset expressiveness, and
epistemic learning. Through illustrative examples, we show how reasoning
equilibria can diverge from classical Nash outcomes, offering a new foundation
for strategic interaction in LLM-enabled systems.

### [5] [From Curiosity to Competence: How World Models Interact with the Dynamics of Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08210)
*Fryderyk Mantiuk,Hanqi Zhou,Charley M. Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了智能代理如何平衡好奇心（探索未知）与能力（控制环境），通过比较两种模型驱动的代理，揭示了探索与表征学习的双向互动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究智能代理如何在探索世界（好奇心）和控制环境（能力）之间取得平衡，借鉴认知理论和强化学习。

Method: 比较了两种模型驱动的代理：基于手工状态抽象的Tabular代理和基于学习内部世界模型的Dreamer代理。

Result: Tabular代理显示好奇心和能力引导探索的不同模式，而Dreamer代理揭示了探索与表征学习的双向互动。

Conclusion: 研究形式化了适应性探索作为追求未知与可控之间的平衡，为认知理论和高效强化学习提供了见解。

Abstract: What drives an agent to explore the world while also maintaining control over
the environment? From a child at play to scientists in the lab, intelligent
agents must balance curiosity (the drive to seek knowledge) with competence
(the drive to master and control the environment). Bridging cognitive theories
of intrinsic motivation with reinforcement learning, we ask how evolving
internal representations mediate the trade-off between curiosity (novelty or
information gain) and competence (empowerment). We compare two model-based
agents using handcrafted state abstractions (Tabular) or learning an internal
world model (Dreamer). The Tabular agent shows curiosity and competence guide
exploration in distinct patterns, while prioritizing both improves exploration.
The Dreamer agent reveals a two-way interaction between exploration and
representation learning, mirroring the developmental co-evolution of curiosity
and competence. Our findings formalize adaptive exploration as a balance
between pursuing the unknown and the controllable, offering insights for
cognitive theories and efficient reinforcement learning.

### [6] [Grounding Methods for Neural-Symbolic AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08216)

Result: 实验表明接地标准的选择对神经符号方法的效果至关重要。

Conclusion: 参数化接地方法能够灵活控制表达能力和可扩展性，为神经符号推理提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: A large class of Neural-Symbolic (NeSy) methods employs a machine learner to
process the input entities, while relying on a reasoner based on First-Order
Logic to represent and process more complex relationships among the entities. A
fundamental role for these methods is played by the process of logic grounding,
which determines the relevant substitutions for the logic rules using a
(sub)set of entities. Some NeSy methods use an exhaustive derivation of all
possible substitutions, preserving the full expressive power of the logic
knowledge. This leads to a combinatorial explosion in the number of ground
formulas to consider and, therefore, strongly limits their scalability. Other
methods rely on heuristic-based selective derivations, which are generally more
computationally efficient, but lack a justification and provide no guarantees
of preserving the information provided to and returned by the reasoner. Taking
inspiration from multi-hop symbolic reasoning, this paper proposes a
parametrized family of grounding methods generalizing classic Backward
Chaining. Different selections within this family allow us to obtain commonly
employed grounding methods as special cases, and to control the trade-off
between expressiveness and scalability of the reasoner. The experimental
results show that the selection of the grounding criterion is often as
important as the NeSy method itself.

### [7] [Quantum Federated Learning for Multimodal Data: A Modality-Agnostic Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08217)
*Atit Pokharel,Ratun Rahman,Thomas Morris,Dinh C. Nguyen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态量子联邦学习（QFL）方法，利用量子纠缠实现中间融合，并引入缺失模态无关（MMA）机制以提升模型稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有QFL框架多为单模态，难以应对现实任务中的多模态需求，且缺失模态会影响性能。

Method: 采用多模态QFL框架，结合量子纠缠进行中间融合，并设计MMA机制隔离未训练量子电路。

Result: 在IID和非IID数据分布下，准确率分别提升6.84%和7.25%。

Conclusion: 多模态QFL结合MMA机制显著提升性能，填补了现有研究的空白。

Abstract: Quantum federated learning (QFL) has been recently introduced to enable a
distributed privacy-preserving quantum machine learning (QML) model training
across quantum processors (clients). Despite recent research efforts, existing
QFL frameworks predominantly focus on unimodal systems, limiting their
applicability to real-world tasks that often naturally involve multiple
modalities. To fill this significant gap, we present for the first time a novel
multimodal approach specifically tailored for the QFL setting with the
intermediate fusion using quantum entanglement. Furthermore, to address a major
bottleneck in multimodal QFL, where the absence of certain modalities during
training can degrade model performance, we introduce a Missing Modality
Agnostic (MMA) mechanism that isolates untrained quantum circuits, ensuring
stable training without corrupted states. Simulation results demonstrate that
the proposed multimodal QFL method with MMA yields an improvement in accuracy
of 6.84% in independent and identically distributed (IID) and 7.25% in non-IID
data distributions compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

paper argues, could lead to formidable new vectors of AI harm. To support this
argument, we first examine the unique properties of cryptocurrencies and smart
contracts that could lead to these new vectors of harm. Next, we describe each

*Abhinav Sood,Kazjon Grace,Stephen Wan,Cecile Paris*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文回顾了不同领域中溯因推理的讨论，分析了计算系统中的应用，指出理论和计算实现均未能充分支持创造性假设的生成，并提出了未来研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨溯因推理在科学、设计和计算系统中的理解与应用，揭示其在创造性假设生成上的不足。

Method: 通过文献综述和分析计算系统的实现方式，分解溯因推理的组成部分。

Result: 理论和计算系统均未能有效支持创造性溯因假设的生成。

Conclusion: 未来研究应关注如何提升计算系统中创造性溯因推理的能力。

Abstract: Abductive reasoning, reasoning for inferring explanations for observations,
is often mentioned in scientific, design-related and artistic contexts, but its
understanding varies across these domains. This paper reviews how abductive
reasoning is discussed in epistemology, science and design, and then analyses
how various computational systems use abductive reasoning. Our analysis shows
that neither theoretical accounts nor computational implementations of
abductive reasoning adequately address generating creative hypotheses.
Theoretical frameworks do not provide a straightforward model for generating
creative abductive hypotheses, computational systems largely implement
syllogistic forms of abductive reasoning. We break down abductive computational
systems into components and conclude by identifying specific directions for
future research that could advance the state of creative abductive reasoning in
computational systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自主LLM代理的出现，其工具使用能力带来了新的安全风险，包括用户和工具端的威胁，亟需一种统一的安全对齐方法。

Method: 提出了一种三模态分类法（良性、恶意、敏感），并设计了一个基于策略的决策模型和沙盒环境，通过强化学习进行优化。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，安全对齐的代理显著提高了对安全威胁的抵抗能力，同时保持了良性任务的高效性。

Conclusion: 研究表明，安全性和有效性可以共同优化，为自主LLM代理的可信部署奠定了基础。

Abstract: The emergence of autonomous Large Language Model (LLM) agents capable of tool
usage has introduced new safety risks that go beyond traditional conversational
misuse. These agents, empowered to execute external functions, are vulnerable
to both user-initiated threats (e.g., adversarial prompts) and tool-initiated
threats (e.g., malicious outputs from compromised tools). In this paper, we
propose the first unified safety-alignment framework for tool-using agents,
enabling models to handle both channels of threat via structured reasoning and
sandboxed reinforcement learning. We introduce a tri-modal taxonomy, including
benign, malicious, and sensitive for both user prompts and tool responses, and
define a policy-driven decision model. Our framework employs a custom-designed
sandbox environment that simulates real-world tool execution and allows
fine-grained reward shaping. Through extensive evaluations on public and
self-built benchmarks, including Agent SafetyBench, InjecAgent, and BFCL, we
demonstrate that our safety-aligned agents significantly improve resistance to
security threats while preserving strong utility on benign tasks. Our results
show that safety and effectiveness can be jointly optimized, laying the
groundwork for trustworthy deployment of autonomous LLM agents.

TL;DR: M2-Reasoning-7B模型通过创新的数据管道和动态多任务训练策略，提升了多模态大语言模型在动态空间交互中的推理能力，并在8个基准测试中达到SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在动态空间交互能力上存在不足，限制了实际应用。

Method: 引入高质量数据生成管道（294.2K样本）和动态多任务训练策略，结合任务特定奖励。

Result: M2-Reasoning-7B在8个基准测试中表现最优，尤其在空间推理领域。

Conclusion: M2-Reasoning-7B通过数据与训练策略的创新，显著提升了模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), particularly
through Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), have
significantly enhanced their reasoning abilities. However, a critical gap
persists: these models struggle with dynamic spatial interactions, a capability
essential for real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce
M2-Reasoning-7B, a model designed to excel in both general and spatial
reasoning. Our approach integrates two key innovations: (1) a novel data
pipeline that generates 294.2K high-quality data samples (168K for cold-start
fine-tuning and 126.2K for RLVR), which feature logically coherent reasoning
trajectories and have undergone comprehensive assessment; and (2) a dynamic
multi-task training strategy with step-wise optimization to mitigate conflicts
between data, and task-specific rewards for delivering tailored incentive
signals. This combination of curated data and advanced training allows
M2-Reasoning-7B to set a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) across 8 benchmarks,
showcasing superior performance in both general and spatial reasoning domains.

### [12] [Multi-Agent LLMs as Ethics Advocates in AI-Based Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08392)
*Asma Yamani,Malak Baslyman,Moataz Ahmed*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多智能体LLM的框架，通过伦理倡导代理自动生成伦理需求草案，以解决人工需求获取的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工获取伦理需求效率低且优先级不高，需一种自动化方法以提升效率和覆盖面。

Method: 在多智能体LLM中引入伦理倡导代理，根据系统描述生成伦理需求草案。

Result: 案例研究表明，该框架能覆盖多数人工识别的需求，并发现额外相关需求，但也存在可靠性问题。

Conclusion: 框架有助于推广伦理需求工程，但需结合人工反馈以确保可靠性。

Abstract: Incorporating ethics into the requirement elicitation process is essential
for creating ethically aligned systems. Although eliciting manual ethics
requirements is effective, it requires diverse input from multiple
stakeholders, which can be challenging due to time and resource constraints.
Moreover, it is often given a low priority in the requirements elicitation
process. This study proposes a framework for generating ethics requirements
drafts by introducing an ethics advocate agent in a multi-agent LLM setting.
This agent critiques and provides input on ethical issues based on the system
description. The proposed framework is evaluated through two case studies from
different contexts, demonstrating that it captures the majority of ethics
requirements identified by researchers during 30-minute interviews and
introduces several additional relevant requirements. However, it also
highlights reliability issues in generating ethics requirements, emphasizing
the need for human feedback in this sensitive domain. We believe this work can
facilitate the broader adoption of ethics in the requirements engineering
process, ultimately leading to more ethically aligned products.

each answering a question of the form ''Why P but not Q?''. The problems
compute causes for both P and Q, explicitly comparing their differences. We
investigate the basic properties of our definitions in the setting of
propositional logic. We show, inter alia, that our framework captures a
cardinality-minimal version of existing contrastive explanations in the
literature. Furthermore, we provide an extensive analysis of the computational
complexities of the problems. We also implement the problems for CNF-formulas
using answer set programming and present several examples demonstrating how
they work in practice.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种双层框架，通过任务抽象和逻辑生成两阶段将自然语言映射到逻辑表示，显著提升了推理任务的准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自然语言输入与形式逻辑表示之间的鸿沟，实现更准确、可解释的推理。

Method: 采用双层框架：高层任务抽象（LLM解析自然语言为结构化表示）和低层逻辑生成（LLM生成符号化工作流或可执行程序）。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，准确率显著提升（最高40%），同时增强了透明度和错误追踪能力。

Conclusion: 双层框架为LLM提供了可信赖、系统化的推理能力，具有跨领域通用性。

Abstract: Structured reasoning over natural language inputs remains a core challenge in
artificial intelligence, as it requires bridging the gap between unstructured
linguistic expressions and formal logical representations. In this paper, we
propose a novel \textbf{bi-level framework} that maps language to logic through
a two-stage process: high-level task abstraction and low-level logic
generation. At the upper level, a large language model (LLM) parses natural
language queries into intermediate structured representations specifying the
problem type, objectives, decision variables, and symbolic constraints. At the
lower level, the LLM uses these representations to generate symbolic workflows
or executable reasoning programs for accurate and interpretable decision
making. The framework supports modular reasoning, enforces explicit
constraints, and generalizes across domains such as mathematical problem
solving, question answering, and logical inference. We further optimize the
framework with an end-to-end {bi-level} optimization approach that jointly
refines both the high-level abstraction and low-level logic generation stages.
Experiments on multiple realistic reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms existing baselines in accuracy, with
accuracy gains reaching as high as 40\%. Moreover, the bi-level design enhances
transparency and error traceability, offering a promising step toward
trustworthy and systematic reasoning with LLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于多LLM知识融合的查询重写框架，用于构建高质量语音指令数据集，无需人工标注，显著提升数据可用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语音指令数据集缺乏且训练任务存在偏差，LLM生成的语音指令与真实人类响应存在差距，人工标注成本高，因此需要一种高效替代方案。

Method: 采用多LLM知识融合的查询重写框架，通过多智能体标注和验证合成语音，将文本指令转换为更适合TTS模型的数据分布。

Result: 实验表明，该方法通过零样本重写将数据可用性从72%提升至93%，并在复杂知识相关任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法为构建高质量语音指令数据集提供了高效、低成本的解决方案，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: End-to-end Large Speech Language Models~(\textbf{LSLMs}) demonstrate strong
potential in response latency and speech comprehension capabilities, showcasing
general intelligence across speech understanding tasks. However, the ability to
follow speech instructions has not been fully realized due to the lack of
datasets and heavily biased training tasks. Leveraging the rich ASR datasets,
previous approaches have used Large Language Models~(\textbf{LLMs}) to continue
the linguistic information of speech to construct speech instruction datasets.
Yet, due to the gap between LLM-generated results and real human responses, the
continuation methods further amplify these shortcomings. Given the high costs
of collecting and annotating speech instruction datasets by humans, using
speech synthesis to construct large-scale speech instruction datasets has
become a balanced and robust alternative. Although modern
Text-To-Speech~(\textbf{TTS}) models have achieved near-human-level synthesis
quality, it is challenging to appropriately convert out-of-distribution text
instruction to speech due to the limitations of the training data distribution
in TTS models. To address this issue, we propose a query rewriting framework
with multi-LLM knowledge fusion, employing multiple agents to annotate and
validate the synthesized speech, making it possible to construct high-quality
speech instruction datasets without relying on human annotation. Experiments
show that this method can transform text instructions into distributions more
suitable for TTS models for speech synthesis through zero-shot rewriting,
increasing data usability from 72\% to 93\%. It also demonstrates unique
advantages in rewriting tasks that require complex knowledge and
context-related abilities.

Motivation: 罕见病诊断因知识表示深度不足、概念理解有限和临床推理受限而进展缓慢。

Method: 采用多粒度稀疏激活医学概念，结合分层知识图谱（分类、临床特征、实例），并辅以四种匹配算法、多样性控制和五级回退策略。

Abstract: Despite advances from medical large language models in healthcare,
rare-disease diagnosis remains hampered by insufficient
knowledge-representation depth, limited concept understanding, and constrained
clinical reasoning. We propose a framework that couples multi-granularity
sparse activation of medical concepts with a hierarchical knowledge graph. Four
complementary matching algorithms, diversity control, and a five-level fallback
strategy enable precise concept activation, while a three-layer knowledge graph
(taxonomy, clinical features, instances) provides structured, up-to-date

ROUGE gains of 0.05, and accuracy gains of 0.12, with peak accuracy of 0.89
approaching the 0.90 clinical threshold. Expert evaluation confirms
improvements in information quality, reasoning, and professional expression,
suggesting our approach shortens the "diagnostic odyssey" for rare-disease

*Kalana Wijegunarathna,Kristin Stock,Christopher B. Jones*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种利用大型多模态模型（LMM）进行地理参考的新方法，通过视觉化空间关系提升准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自然历史收藏中大量未地理参考样本的问题，现有自动化方法未充分利用地图信息。

Method: 采用网格化方法，结合多模态模型在零样本设置下进行地理参考。

Result: 实验显示新方法平均距离误差约为1公里，优于单模态方法和现有工具。

Conclusion: LMM能理解精细地图，提出将该方法整合到地理参考工作流程的框架。

Abstract: Millions of biological sample records collected in the last few centuries
archived in natural history collections are un-georeferenced. Georeferencing
complex locality descriptions associated with these collection samples is a
highly labour-intensive task collection agencies struggle with. None of the
existing automated methods exploit maps that are an essential tool for
georeferencing complex relations. We present preliminary experiments and
results of a novel method that exploits multi-modal capabilities of recent
Large Multi-Modal Models (LMM). This method enables the model to visually
contextualize spatial relations it reads in the locality description. We use a
grid-based approach to adapt these auto-regressive models for this task in a
zero-shot setting. Our experiments conducted on a small manually annotated
dataset show impressive results for our approach ($\sim$1 km Average distance
error) compared to uni-modal georeferencing with Large Language Models and
existing georeferencing tools. The paper also discusses the findings of the
experiments in light of an LMM's ability to comprehend fine-grained maps.
Motivated by these results, a practical framework is proposed to integrate this
method into a georeferencing workflow.

*Soheyl Massoudi,Mark Fuge*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文研究了多智能体系统（MAS）在早期工程设计中的表现，比较了其与双智能体系统（2AS）在需求提取、功能分解和代码生成方面的效果。结果显示MAS在生成更详细的设计图方面表现更好，但需求覆盖率和代码兼容性仍有不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早期工程设计需要复杂的迭代推理，现有的大语言模型（LLM）工作流难以保持任务连续性和生成可执行模型。因此，研究如何通过结构化多智能体系统提升设计效率。

Method: 引入Design-State Graph（DSG）作为JSON可序列化的设计表示，比较九角色MAS和双角色2AS的性能。实验基于两种LLM（Llama 3.3 70B和DeepSeek R1 70B），在不同配置下运行60次实验。

Result: MAS和2AS均保持了完美的JSON完整性和实体标记，但需求覆盖率低于20%。代码兼容性在2AS特定设置下达到100%，但MAS平均低于50%。MAS生成的设计图更详细（5-6节点），而2AS模式崩溃。

Conclusion: 结构化多智能体系统能增强设计细节，但需求覆盖率和代码兼容性仍需改进。推理蒸馏的LLM提高了任务完成率，但低需求覆盖和代码保真度问题仍然存在。

Abstract: Early-stage engineering design involves complex, iterative reasoning, yet
existing large language model (LLM) workflows struggle to maintain task
continuity and generate executable models. We evaluate whether a structured
multi-agent system (MAS) can more effectively manage requirements extraction,
functional decomposition, and simulator code generation than a simpler
two-agent system (2AS). The target application is a solar-powered water
filtration system as described in a cahier des charges. We introduce the
Design-State Graph (DSG), a JSON-serializable representation that bundles
requirements, physical embodiments, and Python-based physics models into graph
nodes. A nine-role MAS iteratively builds and refines the DSG, while the 2AS
collapses the process to a Generator-Reflector loop. Both systems run a total
of 60 experiments (2 LLMs - Llama 3.3 70B vs reasoning-distilled DeepSeek R1
70B x 2 agent configurations x 3 temperatures x 5 seeds). We report a JSON
validity, requirement coverage, embodiment presence, code compatibility,
workflow completion, runtime, and graph size. Across all runs, both MAS and 2AS
maintained perfect JSON integrity and embodiment tagging. Requirement coverage
remained minimal (less than 20\%). Code compatibility peaked at 100\% under
specific 2AS settings but averaged below 50\% for MAS. Only the
reasoning-distilled model reliably flagged workflow completion. Powered by
DeepSeek R1 70B, the MAS generated more granular DSGs (average 5-6 nodes)
whereas 2AS mode-collapsed. Structured multi-agent orchestration enhanced
design detail. Reasoning-distilled LLM improved completion rates, yet low
requirements and fidelity gaps in coding persisted.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于Leanabell-Prover-V1的改进，通过强化学习（RL）和验证器反馈优化模型性能。

Method: 采用验证器反馈（如成功或错误指示）和多轮交互，结合反馈令牌掩码和简单奖励策略，优化推理轨迹。

Result: 在MiniF2F测试集上，性能提升3.2%（Kimina-Prover-Preview-Distill-7B）和2.0%（DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B）。

Conclusion: Leanabell-Prover-V2通过验证器反馈和多轮交互显著提升了形式化定理证明的性能。

Abstract: We introduce our Leanabell-Prover-V2, a 7B large language models (LLMs) that
can produce formal theorem proofs in Lean 4, with verifier-integrated Long
Chain-of-Thoughts (CoT). Following our previous work Leanabell-Prover-V1, we
continual to choose to posttrain existing strong prover models for further
performance improvement. In our V2 version, we mainly upgrade the Reinforcement
Learning (RL) with feedback provided by the Lean 4 verifier. Crucially,
verifier feedback, such as indicating success or detailing specific errors,
allows the LLM to become ``self-aware'' of the correctness of its own reasoning
process and learn to reflexively correct errors. Leanabell-Prover-V2 directly
optimizes LLM reasoning trajectories with multi-turn verifier interactions,
together with feedback token masking for stable RL training and a simple reward
strategy. Experiments show that Leanabell-Prover-V2 improves performance by
3.2% (pass@128) with Kimina-Prover-Preview-Distill-7B and 2.0% (pass@128) with
DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B on the MiniF2F test set. The source codes, curated data

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为INoT的新型AI代理推理框架，通过设计新的LLM-Read代码提示，减少推理成本并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI代理依赖复杂的提示工程和外部推理框架，但仍受限于LLM的自然语言理解能力，且推理过程成本高昂。

Method: 设计了LLM-Read代码提示，使LLM能够执行程序化对话推理，实现自我否定和反思，从而降低令牌成本。

Result: 在六个基准测试中，INoT平均性能提升7.95%，令牌成本比基线最佳方法低58.3%。

Conclusion: INoT在性能和成本上均优于现有方法，并展示了在图像任务中的通用性。

Abstract: AI Agents rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal-LLMs (MLLMs) to
perform interpretation and inference in text and image tasks without
post-training, where LLMs and MLLMs play the most critical role and determine
the initial ability and limitations of AI Agents. Usually, AI Agents utilize
sophisticated prompt engineering and external reasoning framework to obtain a
promising interaction with LLMs, e.g., Chain-of-Thought, Iteration of Thought
and Image-of-Thought. However, they are still constrained by the inherent
limitations of LLM in understanding natural language, and the iterative
reasoning process will generate a large amount of inference cost. To this end,
we propose a novel AI Agent Reasoning Framework with Introspection of Thought
(INoT) by designing a new LLM-Read code in prompt. It enables LLM to execute
programmatic dialogue reasoning processes following the code in prompt.
Therefore, self-denial and reflection occur within LLM instead of outside LLM,
which can reduce token cost effectively. Through our experiments on six
benchmarks for three different tasks, the effectiveness of INoT is verified,
with an average improvement of 7.95\% in performance, exceeding the baselines.
Furthermore, the token cost of INoT is lower on average than the best
performing method at baseline by 58.3\%. In addition, we demonstrate the
versatility of INoT in image interpretation and inference through verification
experiments.

Empirical results indicate that these instructions \textit{can} improve a

use of efficient dedicated approaches (often physics-based simulations) is

Motivation: 现有基于提示的文本转语音模型虽然用户友好，但存在控制范围有限和输出不可控变化的问题。

Method: 通过主成分分析确定潜在特征，并将其作为新标签进行二次微调。

Result: 在未包含情感披露的模型上，该方法生成了连续和离散特征，提高了模型的可控性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了模型的控制范围和不可控变化问题，提高了整体可控性。

Abstract: A Prompt-based Text-To-Speech model allows a user to control different
aspects of speech, such as speaking rate and perceived gender, through natural
language instruction. Although user-friendly, such approaches are on one hand
constrained: control is limited to acoustic features exposed to the model
during training, and too flexible on the other: the same inputs yields
uncontrollable variation that are reflected in the corpus statistics.
  We investigate a novel fine-tuning regime to address both of these issues at
the same time by exploiting the uncontrollable variance of the model. Through
principal component analysis of thousands of synthesised samples, we determine
latent features that account for the highest proportion of the output variance
and incorporate them as new labels for secondary fine-tuning. We evaluate the
proposed methods on two models trained on an expressive Icelandic speech
corpus, one with emotional disclosure and one without. In the case of the model
without emotional disclosure, the method yields both continuous and discrete
features that improve overall controllability of the model.

TL;DR: CRMAgent是一个基于大型语言模型的多代理系统，通过三种模式生成高质量消息模板和写作指导，显著提升电商私域渠道的营销效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电商私域渠道中，商家缺乏专业知识和工具来撰写有说服力的消息，导致营销效果不佳。

Method: CRMAgent采用三种模式：基于群体学习、检索与适应、规则回退，生成和优化消息模板。

Result: 实验表明，CRMAgent在受众匹配和营销效果指标上显著优于商家原始模板。

Conclusion: CRMAgent为商家提供了一种可扩展且高效的解决方案，显著提升了私域渠道的营销效果。

Abstract: In e-commerce private-domain channels such as instant messaging and e-mail,
merchants engage customers directly as part of their Customer Relationship
Management (CRM) programmes to drive retention and conversion. While a few top
performers excel at crafting outbound messages, most merchants struggle to
write persuasive copy because they lack both expertise and scalable tools. We
introduce CRMAgent, a multi-agent system built on large language models (LLMs)
that generates high-quality message templates and actionable writing guidance
through three complementary modes. First, group-based learning enables the
agent to learn from a merchant's own top-performing messages within the same
audience segment and rewrite low-performing ones. Second,
retrieval-and-adaptation fetches templates that share the same audience segment
and exhibit high similarity in voucher type and product category, learns their
successful patterns, and adapts them to the current campaign. Third, a
rule-based fallback provides a lightweight zero-shot rewrite when no suitable
references are available. Extensive experiments show that CRMAgent consistently
outperforms merchants' original templates, delivering significant gains in both
audience-match and marketing-effectiveness metrics.

Conclusion: MedicalBERT展示了预训练模型在生物医学NLP任务中的潜力，验证了迁移学习在领域特定信息捕获中的有效性。

Abstract: Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) have been driven
bypretrained language models like BERT, RoBERTa, T5, and GPT. Thesemodels excel
at understanding complex texts, but biomedical literature, withits
domain-specific terminology, poses challenges that models likeWord2Vec and
bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) can't fullyaddress. GPT and T5,
despite capturing context, fall short in tasks needingbidirectional
understanding, unlike BERT. Addressing this, we proposedMedicalBERT, a
pretrained BERT model trained on a large biomedicaldataset and equipped with
domain-specific vocabulary that enhances thecomprehension of biomedical
terminology. MedicalBERT model is furtheroptimized and fine-tuned to address
diverse tasks, including named entityrecognition, relation extraction, question

such as the F1-score,accuracy, and Pearson correlation are employed to showcase
the efficiencyof our model in comparison to other BERT-based models such as

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to support creative tasks
such as research idea generation. While recent work has shown that structured
dialogues between LLMs can improve the novelty and feasibility of generated
ideas, the optimal design of such interactions remains unclear. In this study,
we conduct a comprehensive analysis of multi-agent LLM dialogues for scientific
ideation. We compare different configurations of agent roles, number of agents,
and dialogue depth to understand how these factors influence the novelty and
feasibility of generated ideas. Our experimental setup includes settings where
one agent generates ideas and another critiques them, enabling iterative
improvement. Our results show that enlarging the agent cohort, deepening the
interaction depth, and broadening agent persona heterogeneity each enrich the
diversity of generated ideas. Moreover, specifically increasing critic-side
diversity within the ideation-critique-revision loop further boosts the
feasibility of the final proposals. Our findings offer practical guidelines for
building effective multi-agent LLM systems for scientific ideation. Our code is

Conclusion: 研究挑战了攻防升级的普遍观点，指出人类创造力限制了攻击复杂性，同时强调学术披露可能破坏现有平衡。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly deployed, understanding
the complexity and evolution of jailbreaking strategies is critical for AI
safety.
  We present a mass-scale empirical analysis of jailbreak complexity across
over 2 million real-world conversations from diverse platforms, including
dedicated jailbreaking communities and general-purpose chatbots. Using a range
of complexity metrics spanning probabilistic measures, lexical diversity,
compression ratios, and cognitive load indicators, we find that jailbreak
attempts do not exhibit significantly higher complexity than normal
conversations. This pattern holds consistently across specialized jailbreaking
communities and general user populations, suggesting practical bounds on attack
sophistication. Temporal analysis reveals that while user attack toxicity and
complexity remains stable over time, assistant response toxicity has decreased,
indicating improving safety mechanisms. The absence of power-law scaling in
complexity distributions further points to natural limits on jailbreak
development.
  Our findings challenge the prevailing narrative of an escalating arms race
between attackers and defenders, instead suggesting that LLM safety evolution
is bounded by human ingenuity constraints while defensive measures continue
advancing. Our results highlight critical information hazards in academic
jailbreak disclosure, as sophisticated attacks exceeding current complexity
baselines could disrupt the observed equilibrium and enable widespread harm
before defensive adaptation.

Result: LLM能可靠检测动态讨论中的共识，加入共识检测智能体可提升辩论效率和质量，接近真实决策会议的效果。

Conclusion: LLM多智能体系统能有效模拟群体决策过程，支持跨领域专家研讨会的决策支持。

Abstract: Decision conferences are structured, collaborative meetings that bring
together experts from various fields to address complex issues and reach a
consensus on recommendations for future actions or policies. These conferences
often rely on facilitated discussions to ensure productive dialogue and
collective agreement. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
significant promise in simulating real-world scenarios, particularly through
collaborative multi-agent systems that mimic group interactions. In this work,
we present a novel LLM-based multi-agent system designed to simulate decision
conferences, specifically focusing on detecting agreement among the participant
agents. To achieve this, we evaluate six distinct LLMs on two tasks: stance
detection, which identifies the position an agent takes on a given issue, and
stance polarity detection, which identifies the sentiment as positive,
negative, or neutral. These models are further assessed within the multi-agent
system to determine their effectiveness in complex simulations. Our results
indicate that LLMs can reliably detect agreement even in dynamic and nuanced
debates. Incorporating an agreement-detection agent within the system can also
improve the efficiency of group debates and enhance the overall quality and
coherence of deliberations, making them comparable to real-world decision
conferences regarding outcome and decision-making. These findings demonstrate
the potential for LLM-based multi-agent systems to simulate group
decision-making processes. They also highlight that such systems could be
instrumental in supporting decision-making with expert elicitation workshops
across various domains.

Motivation: 评估FinGPT在金融领域NLP任务中的能力，为未来研究提供基准。

Method: 使用金融领域数据集对FinGPT在六项NLP任务上进行评估，并与GPT-4和人类基准对比。

Result: FinGPT在分类任务中表现优异，但在推理和生成任务中表现不足。

Conclusion: FinGPT适用于结构化金融任务，但需进一步优化以提升推理和生成能力。

Abstract: This work evaluates FinGPT, a financial domain-specific language model,
across six key natural language processing (NLP) tasks: Sentiment Analysis,
Text Classification, Named Entity Recognition, Financial Question Answering,
Text Summarization, and Stock Movement Prediction. The evaluation uses
finance-specific datasets to assess FinGPT's capabilities and limitations in
real-world financial applications. The results show that FinGPT performs
strongly in classification tasks such as sentiment analysis and headline
categorization, often achieving results comparable to GPT-4. However, its
performance is significantly lower in tasks that involve reasoning and
generation, such as financial question answering and summarization. Comparisons
with GPT-4 and human benchmarks highlight notable performance gaps,
particularly in numerical accuracy and complex reasoning. Overall, the findings
indicate that while FinGPT is effective for certain structured financial tasks,
it is not yet a comprehensive solution. This research provides a useful
benchmark for future research and underscores the need for architectural
improvements and domain-specific optimization in financial language models.

Method: 提出三层级的机器理解理论：概念理解、世界状态理解和原则性理解。

Result: LLMs形成内部结构，功能上类似于理解，但其认知架构与人类不同。

Conclusion: 应关注LLMs的独特工作机制，而非争论其是否具备理解能力。

Abstract: Recent findings in mechanistic interpretability (MI), the field probing the
inner workings of Large Language Models (LLMs), challenge the view that these
models rely solely on superficial statistics. Here, we offer an accessible
synthesis of these findings that doubles as an introduction to MI, all while
integrating these findings within a novel theoretical framework for thinking
about machine understanding. We argue that LLMs develop internal structures
that are functionally analogous to the kind of understanding that consists in
seeing connections. To sharpen this idea, we propose a three-tiered conception
of machine understanding. First, conceptual understanding emerges when a model
forms "features" as directions in latent space, thereby learning the
connections between diverse manifestations of something. Second,
state-of-the-world understanding emerges when a model learns contingent factual
connections between features and dynamically tracks changes in the world.
Third, principled understanding emerges when a model ceases to rely on a
collection of memorized facts and discovers a "circuit" that connects these
facts. However, we conclude by exploring the "parallel mechanisms" phenomenon,
arguing that while LLMs exhibit forms of understanding, their cognitive
architecture remains different from ours, and the debate should shift from
whether LLMs understand to how their strange minds work.

Conclusion: R3是一种简单有效的框架，显著提升预训练模型的文本生成能力。

Abstract: A key challenge for iterative text generation is enabling models to
efficiently identify and correct their own errors. We propose Review, Remask,
Refine (R3), a relatively simple yet elegant framework that requires no
additional model training and can be applied to any pre-trained masked text
diffusion model (e.g., LLaDA or BD3-LM). In R3, a Process Reward Model (PRM) is
utilized for the Review of intermediate generated blocks. The framework then
translates these PRM scores into a Remask strategy: the lower a block's PRM

*Aryan Varshney,Venkat Ram Reddy Ganuthula*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨大型语言模型（LLMs）在简历筛选中的行为一致性（信号）与随机性（噪声），并与人类专家表现对比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解LLMs在自动化招聘系统中的表现及其与人类专家的差异，为实际应用提供依据。

Method: 使用控制数据集测试三种LLMs（Claude、GPT、Gemini）在不同情境下的表现，并与三位人类招聘专家对比。

Result: LLMs在部分条件下表现显著差异，且与人类专家评价存在显著不同；GPT对情境适应最强，Gemini次之，Claude最弱。

Conclusion: LLMs在详细提示下可提供可解释的模式，但与人类判断差异显著，需谨慎应用于自动化招聘。

Abstract: This study investigates whether large language models (LLMs) exhibit
consistent behavior (signal) or random variation (noise) when screening resumes
against job descriptions, and how their performance compares to human experts.
Using controlled datasets, we tested three LLMs (Claude, GPT, and Gemini)
across contexts (No Company, Firm1 [MNC], Firm2 [Startup], Reduced Context)
with identical and randomized resumes, benchmarked against three human
recruitment experts. Analysis of variance revealed significant mean differences
in four of eight LLM-only conditions and consistently significant differences
between LLM and human evaluations (p < 0.01). Paired t-tests showed GPT adapts
strongly to company context (p < 0.001), Gemini partially (p = 0.038 for
Firm1), and Claude minimally (p > 0.1), while all LLMs differed significantly
from human experts across contexts. Meta-cognition analysis highlighted
adaptive weighting patterns that differ markedly from human evaluation
approaches. Findings suggest LLMs offer interpretable patterns with detailed
prompts but diverge substantially from human judgment, informing their
deployment in automated hiring systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出ETTA框架，通过线性变换识别并减弱嵌入空间中的毒性敏感维度，成功攻击多个开源LLM，揭示了当前对齐策略的漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM在嵌入空间中毒攻击下的安全性问题，现有方法对嵌入层面的安全对齐机制理解不足。

Method: 提出ETTA框架，利用线性变换在嵌入空间中识别和减弱毒性敏感维度，无需微调或训练数据。

Result: 在五个开源LLM上测试，ETTA平均攻击成功率达88.61%，优于基线11.34%，并能泛化到安全增强模型。

Conclusion: ETTA揭示了当前对齐策略的漏洞，强调需要嵌入感知的防御措施。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across domains
such as healthcare, education, and cybersecurity. However, this openness also
introduces significant security risks, particularly through embedding space
poisoning, which is a subtle attack vector where adversaries manipulate the
internal semantic representations of input data to bypass safety alignment
mechanisms. While previous research has investigated universal perturbation
methods, the dynamics of LLM safety alignment at the embedding level remain
insufficiently understood. Consequently, more targeted and accurate adversarial
perturbation techniques, which pose significant threats, have not been
adequately studied.
  In this work, we propose ETTA (Embedding Transformation Toxicity
Attenuation), a novel framework that identifies and attenuates
toxicity-sensitive dimensions in embedding space via linear transformations.
ETTA bypasses model refusal behaviors while preserving linguistic coherence,
without requiring model fine-tuning or access to training data. Evaluated on
five representative open-source LLMs using the AdvBench benchmark, ETTA
achieves a high average attack success rate of 88.61%, outperforming the best
baseline by 11.34%, and generalizes to safety-enhanced models (e.g., 77.39% ASR
on instruction-tuned defenses). These results highlight a critical
vulnerability in current alignment strategies and underscore the need for
embedding-aware defenses.

Motivation: 受大型语言模型（LLMs）成功的启发，研究者开发了具有ICL能力的大型多模态模型（LMMs），但多模态ICL的演示配置研究仍处于初步阶段。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过外部实验（如演示配置策略）和内部分析（如注意力特性）研究多模态ICL，并提出新的评估指标。

Result: 揭示了ICEs配置策略对模型性能的影响，发现了典型注意力模式，并探索了注意力驱动的模型加速和压缩的可行性。

Conclusion: 本文通过双重视角（外部和内部）为理解多模态ICL提供了新见解，提出的方法和指标可应用于更广泛的研究领域。

Abstract: The evolution of large models has witnessed the emergence of In-Context
Learning (ICL) capabilities. In Natural Language Processing (NLP), numerous
studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of ICL. Inspired by the success of
Large Language Models (LLMs), researchers have developed Large Multimodal
Models (LMMs) with ICL capabilities. However, explorations of demonstration
configuration for multimodal ICL remain preliminary. Additionally, the
controllability of In-Context Examples (ICEs) provides an efficient and
cost-effective means to observe and analyze the inference characteristics of
LMMs under varying inputs. This paper conducts a comprehensive external and
internal investigation of multimodal in-context learning on the image
captioning task. Externally, we explore demonstration configuration strategies
through three dimensions: shot number, image retrieval, and caption assignment.
We employ multiple metrics to systematically and thoroughly evaluate and
summarize key findings. Internally, we analyze typical LMM attention
characteristics and develop attention-based metrics to quantify model
behaviors. We also conduct auxiliary experiments to explore the feasibility of
attention-driven model acceleration and compression. We further compare
performance variations between LMMs with identical model design and pretraining
strategies and explain the differences from the angles of pre-training data
features. Our study reveals both how ICEs configuration strategies impact model
performance through external experiments and characteristic typical patterns
through internal inspection, providing dual perspectives for understanding
multimodal ICL in LMMs. Our method of combining external and internal analysis
to investigate large models, along with our newly proposed metrics, can be
applied to broader research areas.

TL;DR: 研究发现多数商业大语言模型（LLM）在伦理和政治回应中表现出一致的自由主义倾向，原因包括训练数据、强化学习、学术伦理框架和安全微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM政治倾向的成因及其影响，区分政治偏见与合理认知差异。

Method: 使用道德基础理论、政治意识形态量表和争议指数分析七种主流LLM。

Result: 多数模型优先体现自由主义价值观（如关怀与公平），微调会增强这一倾向。

Conclusion: 自由主义倾向是训练数据的自然结果，可能反映集体理性，而非编程偏见。

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed a consistent liberal orientation in the ethical
and political responses generated by most commercial large language models
(LLMs), yet the underlying causes and resulting implications remain unclear.
This paper systematically investigates the political temperament of seven
prominent LLMs - OpenAI's GPT-4o, Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4, Perplexity
(Sonar Large), Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash, Meta AI's Llama 4, Mistral 7b Le Chat
and High-Flyer's DeepSeek R1 -- using a multi-pronged approach that includes
Moral Foundations Theory, a dozen established political ideology scales and a
new index of current political controversies. We find strong and consistent
prioritization of liberal-leaning values, particularly care and fairness,
across most models. Further analysis attributes this trend to four overlapping
factors: Liberal-leaning training corpora, reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF), the dominance of liberal frameworks in academic ethical
discourse and safety-driven fine-tuning practices. We also distinguish between
political "bias" and legitimate epistemic differences, cautioning against
conflating the two. A comparison of base and fine-tuned model pairs reveals
that fine-tuning generally increases liberal lean, an effect confirmed through
both self-report and empirical testing. We argue that this "liberal tilt" is
not a programming error or the personal preference of programmers but an
emergent property of training on democratic rights-focused discourse. Finally,
we propose that LLMs may indirectly echo John Rawls' famous veil-of ignorance
philosophical aspiration, reflecting a moral stance unanchored to personal
identity or interest. Rather than undermining democratic discourse, this
pattern may offer a new lens through which to examine collective reasoning.

Motivation: 量化AI在招聘中对效率和候选人选择的影响，填补实证研究的空白。

Method: 将37,000名申请者随机分配到传统招聘流程或AI辅助流程（AI视频面试+人工筛选），最终统一进行盲面。

Result: AI组通过率提高20个百分点，就业概率高5.9个百分点，但偏向年轻、低经验候选人。

Conclusion: AI提升招聘效率，但需关注其选择偏好及潜在影响。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used in recruitment, yet
empirical evidence quantifying its impact on hiring efficiency and candidate
selection remains limited. We randomly assign 37,000 applicants for a
junior-developer position to either a traditional recruitment process (resume
screening followed by human selection) or an AI-assisted recruitment pipeline
incorporating an initial AI-driven structured video interview before human
evaluation. Candidates advancing from either track faced the same final-stage
human interview, with interviewers blind to the earlier selection method. In
the AI-assisted pipeline, 54% of candidates passed the final interview compared
with 34% from the traditional pipeline, yielding an average treatment effect of
20 percentage points (SE 12 pp.). Five months later, we collected LinkedIn
profiles of top applicants from both groups and found that 18% (SE 1.1%) of
applicants from the traditional track found new jobs compared with 23% (SE
2.3%) from the AI group, resulting in a 5.9 pp. (SE 2.6 pp.) difference in the
probability of finding new employment between groups. The AI system tended to
select younger applicants with less experience and fewer advanced credentials.
We analyze AI-generated interview transcripts to examine the selection criteria
and conversational dynamics. Our findings contribute to understanding how AI
technologies affect decision making in recruitment and talent acquisition while
highlighting some of their potential implications.

Motivation: 评估生成式AI模型在医疗领域输出中免责声明的变化趋势，以提醒用户AI输出未经专业审核。

Method: 使用500份乳腺X光片、500份胸部X光片、500份皮肤病图像和500个医学问题，检测LLM和VLM输出中的免责声明短语。

Result: 免责声明在LLM和VLM输出中的比例从2022年的26.3%和2023年的19.6%分别降至2025年的0.97%和1.05%。

Conclusion: 随着模型能力的提升，免责声明需根据临床情境调整，以确保用户安全。

Abstract: Generative AI models, including large language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs), are increasingly used to interpret medical
images and answer clinical questions. Their responses often include
inaccuracies; therefore, safety measures like medical disclaimers are critical
to remind users that AI outputs are not professionally vetted or a substitute
for medical advice. This study evaluated the presence of disclaimers in LLM and
VLM outputs across model generations from 2022 to 2025. Using 500 mammograms,
500 chest X-rays, 500 dermatology images, and 500 medical questions, outputs
were screened for disclaimer phrases. Medical disclaimer presence in LLM and
VLM outputs dropped from 26.3% in 2022 to 0.97% in 2025, and from 19.6% in 2023
to 1.05% in 2025, respectively. By 2025, the majority of models displayed no
disclaimers. As public models become more capable and authoritative,
disclaimers must be implemented as a safeguard adapting to the clinical context
of each output.

Motivation: 研究SLMs作为隐私保护替代方案在心理健康理解任务中的能力，并与LLMs进行比较。

Method: 采用零样本和少样本学习范式，评估五种SLMs和三种LLMs在六项心理健康任务中的表现。

Result: SLMs在二元分类任务中表现接近LLMs（F1分数0.64 vs 0.66），少样本学习显著提升SLMs性能（最高14.6%）。

Conclusion: SLMs在心理健康领域具有潜力，适合隐私敏感数据的分析，尤其是通过少样本学习快速适应任务。

Abstract: The emergence of Small Language Models (SLMs) as privacy-preserving
alternatives for sensitive applications raises a fundamental question about
their inherent understanding capabilities compared to Large Language Models
(LLMs). This paper investigates the mental health understanding capabilities of
current SLMs through systematic evaluation across diverse classification tasks.
Employing zero-shot and few-shot learning paradigms, we benchmark their
performance against established LLM baselines to elucidate their relative
strengths and limitations in this critical domain. We assess five
state-of-the-art SLMs (Phi-3, Phi-3.5, Qwen2.5, Llama-3.2, Gemma2) against
three LLMs (GPT-4, FLAN-T5-XXL, Alpaca-7B) on six mental health understanding
tasks. Our findings reveal that SLMs achieve mean performance within 2\% of
LLMs on binary classification tasks (F1 scores of 0.64 vs 0.66 in zero-shot
settings), demonstrating notable competence despite orders of magnitude fewer
parameters. Both model categories experience similar degradation on multi-class
severity tasks (a drop of over 30\%), suggesting that nuanced clinical
understanding challenges transcend model scale. Few-shot prompting provides
substantial improvements for SLMs (up to 14.6\%), while LLM gains are more
variable. Our work highlights the potential of SLMs in mental health
understanding, showing they can be effective privacy-preserving tools for
analyzing sensitive online text data. In particular, their ability to quickly
adapt and specialize with minimal data through few-shot learning positions them
as promising candidates for scalable mental health screening tools.

Result: 在MMLU数据集上评估，数学推理准确率83%，科学推理88%，优于GPT-4o等模型。

Conclusion: 该框架为构建复杂计算生态系统提供了可能，使LLMs更自然地支持多任务。

Abstract: This paper deals with improving querying large language models (LLMs). It is
well-known that without relevant contextual information, LLMs can provide poor
quality responses or tend to hallucinate. Several initiatives have proposed
integrating LLMs with external tools to provide them with up-to-date data to
improve accuracy. In this paper, we propose a framework to integrate external
tools to enhance the capabilities of LLMs in answering queries in educational
settings. Precisely, we develop a framework that allows accessing external APIs
to request additional relevant information. Integrated tools can also provide
computational capabilities such as calculators or calendars. The proposed
framework has been evaluated using datasets from the Multi-Modal Language
Understanding (MMLU) collection. The data consists of questions on mathematical
and scientific reasoning. Results compared to state-of-the-art language models
show that the proposed approach significantly improves performance. Our Athena
framework achieves 83% accuracy in mathematical reasoning and 88% in scientific
reasoning, substantially outperforming all tested models including GPT-4o,
LLaMA-Large, Mistral-Large, Phi-Large, and GPT-3.5, with the best baseline
model (LLaMA-Large) achieving only 67% and 79% respectively. These promising
results open the way to creating complex computing ecosystems around LLMs to
make their use more natural to support various tasks and activities.

Motivation: 探讨MedVQA在临床工作流程中的实际应用、挑战和差距，以促进其更好地服务于医疗诊断。

Method: 采用Arksey和O'Malley的范围综述框架，结合文献回顾和临床医生调查，分析MedVQA的现状和问题。

Result: 研究发现60%的问答对缺乏临床相关性，数据集和模型不支持多视图或多分辨率成像，且评估指标与临床需求不匹配。临床医生中仅29.8%认为MedVQA高度有用。

Conclusion: MedVQA潜力巨大，但需解决多模态分析不足、缺乏患者背景和评估方法不匹配等问题，以实现有效的临床整合。

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (MedVQA) is a promising tool to assist
radiologists by automating medical image interpretation through question
answering. Despite advances in models and datasets, MedVQA's integration into
clinical workflows remains limited. This study systematically reviews 68
publications (2018-2024) and surveys 50 clinicians from India and Thailand to
examine MedVQA's practical utility, challenges, and gaps. Following the Arksey
and O'Malley scoping review framework, we used a two-pronged approach: (1)
reviewing studies to identify key concepts, advancements, and research gaps in
radiology workflows, and (2) surveying clinicians to capture their perspectives
on MedVQA's clinical relevance. Our review reveals that nearly 60% of QA pairs
are non-diagnostic and lack clinical relevance. Most datasets and models do not
support multi-view, multi-resolution imaging, EHR integration, or domain
knowledge, features essential for clinical diagnosis. Furthermore, there is a
clear mismatch between current evaluation metrics and clinical needs. The
clinician survey confirms this disconnect: only 29.8% consider MedVQA systems
highly useful. Key concerns include the absence of patient history or domain
knowledge (87.2%), preference for manually curated datasets (51.1%), and the
need for multi-view image support (78.7%). Additionally, 66% favor models
focused on specific anatomical regions, and 89.4% prefer dialogue-based
interactive systems. While MedVQA shows strong potential, challenges such as
limited multimodal analysis, lack of patient context, and misaligned evaluation
approaches must be addressed for effective clinical integration.

Result: 微调小模型生成的计划质量高于大模型少样本提示，且优于Chain-of-Thought推理。

Conclusion: CRISP展示了计划生成能力的通用性，跨领域微调也能提升性能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) underscore the need for
stronger reasoning capabilities to solve complex problems effectively. While
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has been a step forward, it remains
insufficient for many domains. A promising alternative is explicit high-level
plan generation, but existing approaches largely assume that LLMs can produce
effective plans through few-shot prompting alone, without additional training.
In this work, we challenge this assumption and introduce CRISP (Complex
Reasoning with Interpretable Step-based Plans), a multi-domain dataset of
high-level plans for mathematical reasoning and code generation. The plans in
CRISP are automatically generated and rigorously validated--both intrinsically,
using an LLM as a judge, and extrinsically, by evaluating their impact on
downstream task performance. We demonstrate that fine-tuning a small model on
CRISP enables it to generate higher-quality plans than much larger models using
few-shot prompting, while significantly outperforming Chain-of-Thought
reasoning. Furthermore, our out-of-domain evaluation reveals that fine-tuning
on one domain improves plan generation in the other, highlighting the
generalizability of learned planning capabilities.

Conclusion: 当前语言模型在消融实验规划任务中仍有挑战，链式思维提示优于现有代理方法。

Abstract: Autonomous agents built on language models (LMs) are showing increasing
popularity in many fields, including scientific research. AI co-scientists aim
to support or automate parts of the research process using these agents. A key
component of empirical AI research is the design of ablation experiments. To
this end, we introduce AblationBench, a benchmark suite for evaluating agents
on ablation planning tasks in empirical AI research. It includes two tasks:
AuthorAblation, which helps authors propose ablation experiments based on a
method section and contains 83 instances, and ReviewerAblation, which helps
reviewers find missing ablations in a full paper and contains 350 instances.
For both tasks, we develop LM-based judges that serve as an automatic
evaluation framework. Our experiments with frontier LMs show that these tasks
remain challenging, with the best-performing LM system identifying only 29% of
the original ablations on average. Lastly, we analyze the limitations of
current LMs on these tasks, and find that chain-of-thought prompting
outperforms the currently existing agent-based approach.

TL;DR: Krul是一个多轮LLM推理系统，通过动态选择压缩策略和优化KV缓存恢复，显著提升了效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多轮对话中KV缓存恢复的效率问题，避免静态压缩策略导致的准确性下降。

Method: 动态选择压缩策略、预压缩策略选择器、异构注意力相似性估计器和无气泡恢复调度器。

Result: TTFT减少1.5x-2.68x，KV缓存存储减少1.33x-2.35x，且不损失生成质量。

Conclusion: Krul在效率和准确性上优于现有方法，适用于多轮对话场景。

Abstract: Efficient state restoration in multi-turn conversations with large language
models (LLMs) remains a critical challenge, primarily due to the overhead of
recomputing or loading full key-value (KV) caches for all historical tokens. To
address this, existing approaches compress KV caches across adjacent layers
with highly similar attention patterns. However, these methods often apply a
fixed compression scheme across all conversations, selecting the same layer
pairs for compression without considering conversation-specific attention
dynamics. This static strategy overlooks variability in attention pattern
similarity across different conversations, which can lead to noticeable
accuracy degradation.
  We present Krul, a multi-turn LLM inference system that enables accurate and
efficient KV cache restoration. Krul dynamically selects compression strategies
based on attention similarity across layer pairs and uses a
recomputation-loading pipeline to restore the KV cache. It introduces three key
innovations: 1) a preemptive compression strategy selector to preserve critical
context for future conversation turns and selects a customized strategy for the
conversation; 2) a token-wise heterogeneous attention similarity estimator to
mitigate the attention similarity computation and storage overhead during model
generation; 3) a bubble-free restoration scheduler to reduce potential bubbles
brought by the imbalance of recomputing and loading stream due to compressed KV
caches. Empirical evaluations on real-world tasks demonstrate that Krul
achieves a 1.5x-2.68x reduction in time-to-first-token (TTFT) and a 1.33x-2.35x
reduction in KV cache storage compared to state-of-the-art methods without
compromising generation quality.

Motivation: 解决从自然语言生成SPARQL查询的挑战，避免传统方法对微调的依赖，探索零样本或少样本下的性能。

Method: 利用大语言模型策略性执行SPARQL查询，搜索知识图谱中的IRIs和字面量，无需微调。

Result: 在Wikidata上达到SOTA，Freebase接近最佳少样本方法，其他知识图谱表现良好。

Conclusion: 该方法在零样本或少样本下表现优异，适用于多种知识图谱和基准测试。

Abstract: We propose a new approach for generating SPARQL queries on RDF knowledge
graphs from natural language questions or keyword queries, using a large
language model. Our approach does not require fine-tuning. Instead, it uses the
language model to explore the knowledge graph by strategically executing SPARQL
queries and searching for relevant IRIs and literals. We evaluate our approach
on a variety of benchmarks (for knowledge graphs of different kinds and sizes)
and language models (of different scales and types, commercial as well as
open-source) and compare it with existing approaches. On Wikidata we reach
state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks, despite the zero-shot setting.
On Freebase we come close to the best few-shot methods. On other, less commonly
evaluated knowledge graphs and benchmarks our approach also performs well
overall. We conduct several additional studies, like comparing different ways
of searching the graphs, incorporating a feedback mechanism, or making use of
few-shot examples.

Abstract: The advent of language models (LMs) has the potential to dramatically
accelerate tasks that may be cast to text-processing; however, real-world
adoption is hindered by concerns regarding safety, explainability, and bias.
How can we responsibly leverage LMs in a transparent, auditable manner --
minimizing risk and allowing human experts to focus on informed decision-making
rather than data-processing or prompt engineering? In this work, we propose a
framework for declaring statically typed, LM-powered subroutines (i.e.,
callable, function-like procedures) for use within conventional asynchronous
code -- such that sparse feedback from human experts is used to improve the
performance of each subroutine online (i.e., during use). In our
implementation, all LM-produced artifacts (i.e., prompts, inputs, outputs, and
data-dependencies) are recorded and exposed to audit on demand. We package this
framework as a library to support its adoption and continued development. While
this framework may be applicable across several real-world decision workflows
(e.g., in healthcare and legal fields), we evaluate it in the context of public
comment processing as mandated by the 1969 National Environmental Protection
Act (NEPA): Specifically, we use this framework to develop "CommentNEPA," an
application that compiles, organizes, and summarizes a corpus of public
commentary submitted in response to a project requiring environmental review.
We quantitatively evaluate the application by comparing its outputs (when
operating without human feedback) to historical ``ground-truth'' data as
labelled by human annotators during the preparation of official environmental
impact statements.

### [46] [Compactor: Calibrated Query-Agnostic KV Cache Compression with Approximate Leverage Scores](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08143)
*Vivek Chari,Benjamin Van Durme*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Compactor是一种无需参数的KV缓存压缩方法，通过近似杠杆分数确定令牌重要性，减少内存需求，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs中长上下文生成时KV缓存内存占用高的问题，降低部署成本。

Method: 使用近似杠杆分数进行令牌重要性评估，提出上下文校准压缩策略。

Result: 在Longbench上减少63%的KV内存负担，同时在27个任务中验证了通用性。

Conclusion: Compactor是一种高效、通用的KV缓存压缩方法，适用于多种模型和任务。

Abstract: Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly trained to support very
large context windows. Unfortunately the ability to use long contexts in
generation is complicated by the large memory requirement of the KV cache,
which scales linearly with the context length. This memory footprint is often
the dominant resource bottleneck in real-world deployments, limiting throughput
and increasing serving cost. One way to address this is by compressing the KV
cache, which can be done either with knowledge of the question being asked
(query-aware) or without knowledge of the query (query-agnostic). We present
Compactor, a parameter-free, query-agnostic KV compression strategy that uses
approximate leverage scores to determine token importance. We show that
Compactor can achieve the same performance as competing methods while retaining
1/2 the tokens in both synthetic and real-world context tasks, with minimal
computational overhead. We further introduce a procedure for context-calibrated
compression, which allows one to infer the maximum compression ratio a given
context can support. Using context-calibrated compression, we show that
Compactor achieves full KV performance on Longbench while reducing the KV
memory burden by 63%, on average. To demonstrate the efficacy and
generalizability of our approach, we apply Compactor to 27 synthetic and
real-world tasks from RULER and Longbench, with models from both the Qwen 2.5
and Llama 3.1 families.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种从大型语言模型（LLM）到小型语言模型（SLM）的知识蒸馏方法，重点保留LLM中的共情能力，并通过两阶段微调和特定提示显著提升SLM的共情表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在资源受限的场景（如智能手机）中，SLM需要保留LLM的共情能力以支持良好的人机交互。

Method: 采用两阶段微调过程，利用从LLM提取的共情对话数据集，并设计四种特定提示以优化共情蒸馏。

Result: 经过优化的SLM在生成共情回应时胜率高达90%，特定提示比基础提示提升10%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了SLM的共情能力，适用于资源受限的应用场景。

Abstract: The distillation of knowledge from Large Language Models (LLMs) into Smaller
Language Models (SLMs), preserving the capabilities and performance of LLMs
while reducing model size, has played a key role in the proliferation of LLMs.
Because SLMs are considerably smaller than LLMs, they are often utilized in
domains where human interaction is frequent but resources are highly
constrained, e.g., smart phones. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that
empathy, a fundamental aspect of positive human interactions, already instilled
into LLMs, is retained by SLMs after distillation. In this paper, we develop a
comprehensive approach for effective empathy distillation from LLMs into SLMs.
Our approach features a two-step fine-tuning process that fully leverages
datasets of empathetic dialogue responses distilled from LLMs. We explore
several distillation methods beyond basic direct prompting and propose four
unique sets of prompts for targeted empathy improvement to significantly
enhance the empathy distillation process. Our evaluations demonstrate that SLMs
fine-tuned through the two-step fine-tuning process with distillation datasets
enhanced by the targeted empathy improvement prompts significantly outperform
the base SLM at generating empathetic responses with a win rate of 90%. Our
targeted empathy improvement prompts substantially outperform the basic direct
prompting with a 10% improvement in win rate.

Motivation: 解决生成式大语言模型（LLMs）输出不真实的问题，提供多样化的真实性预测方法以支持研究与应用。

Method: 开发TruthTorchLM库，整合30多种真实性预测方法，支持HuggingFace和LiteLLM，提供统一的生成、评估和校准接口。

Result: 在TriviaQA、GSM8K和FactScore-Bio数据集上评估了代表性方法，代码已开源。

Conclusion: TruthTorchLM为LLM输出的真实性预测提供了全面且可扩展的工具，适用于多种场景。

Abstract: Generative Large Language Models (LLMs)inevitably produce untruthful
responses. Accurately predicting the truthfulness of these outputs is critical,
especially in high-stakes settings. To accelerate research in this domain and
make truthfulness prediction methods more accessible, we introduce TruthTorchLM
an open-source, comprehensive Python library featuring over 30 truthfulness
prediction methods, which we refer to as Truth Methods. Unlike existing
toolkits such as Guardrails, which focus solely on document-grounded
verification, or LM-Polygraph, which is limited to uncertainty-based methods,
TruthTorchLM offers a broad and extensible collection of techniques. These
methods span diverse tradeoffs in computational cost, access level (e.g.,
black-box vs white-box), grounding document requirements, and supervision type
(self-supervised or supervised). TruthTorchLM is seamlessly compatible with
both HuggingFace and LiteLLM, enabling support for locally hosted and API-based
models. It also provides a unified interface for generation, evaluation,
calibration, and long-form truthfulness prediction, along with a flexible
framework for extending the library with new methods. We conduct an evaluation
of representative truth methods on three datasets, TriviaQA, GSM8K, and
FactScore-Bio. The code is available at https://github.com/Ybakman/TruthTorchLM

### [49] [Simple Mechanistic Explanations for Out-Of-Context Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08218)
*Atticus Wang,Joshua Engels,Oliver Clive-Griffin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，微调后的LLMs表现出意外的分布外泛化能力（OOCR），原因是LoRA微调添加了一个恒定的导向向量，引导模型学习通用概念，从而在相关任务中实现泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在微调后为何能表现出超出上下文的推理能力（OOCR），以理解其泛化机制。

Method: 通过机理分析，发现OOCR现象源于LoRA微调中添加的恒定导向向量，并尝试直接训练这些导向向量以验证其效果。

Result: 恒定导向向量不仅能提升微调任务性能，还能在相关领域实现泛化，甚至适用于看似需要条件行为的任务（如模型后门）。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了微调过程中学习到的导向向量是OOCR的关键，为LLMs的安全可靠部署提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Out-of-context reasoning (OOCR) is a phenomenon in which fine-tuned LLMs
exhibit surprisingly deep out-of-distribution generalization. Rather than
learning shallow heuristics, they implicitly internalize and act on the
consequences of observations scattered throughout the fine-tuning data. In this
work, we investigate this phenomenon mechanistically and find that many
instances of OOCR in the literature have a simple explanation: the LoRA
fine-tuning essentially adds a constant steering vector, steering the model
towards a general concept. This improves performance on the fine-tuning task
and in many other concept-related domains, causing the surprising
generalization. Moreover, we can directly train steering vectors for these
tasks from scratch, which also induces OOCR. We find that our results hold even
for a task that seems like it must involve conditional behavior (model
backdoors); it turns out that unconditionally adding a steering vector is
sufficient. Overall, our work presents one explanation of what gets learned
during fine-tuning for OOCR tasks, contributing to the key question of why LLMs
can reason out of context, an advanced capability that is highly relevant to
their safe and reliable deployment.

Motivation: 探究LLMs作为代理学生是否能准确模拟真实学生的行为和表现，为智能辅导系统的开发提供依据。

Method: 收集489个NAEP题目，应用IRT模型将11种LLMs与真实学生能力对比，并测试不同提示对模型表现的影响。

Result: 强模型普遍优于学生平均水平，弱模型可能偶然对齐；提示调整效果因模型和提示而异，无模型-提示组合能全面匹配学生表现。

Conclusion: 需开发新的训练和评估策略，并提供了基于研究结果的代理选择指南。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as proxy students in the
development of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) and in piloting test
questions. However, to what extent these proxy students accurately emulate the
behavior and characteristics of real students remains an open question. To
investigate this, we collected a dataset of 489 items from the National
Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), covering mathematics and reading
comprehension in grades 4, 8, and 12. We then apply an Item Response Theory
(IRT) model to position 11 diverse and state-of-the-art LLMs on the same
ability scale as real student populations. Our findings reveal that, without
guidance, strong general-purpose models consistently outperform the average
student at every grade, while weaker or domain-mismatched models may align
incidentally. Using grade-enforcement prompts changes models' performance, but
whether they align with the average grade-level student remains highly model-
and prompt-specific: no evaluated model-prompt pair fits the bill across
subjects and grades, underscoring the need for new training and evaluation
strategies. We conclude by providing guidelines for the selection of viable
proxies based on our findings.

Result: HAM-CNN模型的F1得分为0.86，女性帖子更情感化，某些疾病如偏头痛在女性中更普遍。

Conclusion: 性别在疼痛体验中起重要作用，未来研究应考虑性别差异。

Abstract: Pain is an inherent part of human existence, manifesting as both physical and
emotional experiences, and can be categorized as either acute or chronic. Over
the years, extensive research has been conducted to understand the causes of
pain and explore potential treatments, with contributions from various
scientific disciplines. However, earlier studies often overlooked the role of
gender in pain experiences. In this study, we utilized Natural Language
Processing (NLP) to analyze and gain deeper insights into individuals' pain
experiences, with a particular focus on gender differences. We successfully
classified posts into male and female corpora using the Hidden Attribute
Model-Convolutional Neural Network (HAM-CNN), achieving an F1 score of 0.86 by
aggregating posts based on usernames. Our analysis revealed linguistic
differences between genders, with female posts tending to be more emotionally
focused. Additionally, the study highlighted that conditions such as migraine
and sinusitis are more prevalent among females and explored how pain medication
affects individuals differently based on gender.

Motivation: 解决推理密集型任务中模型过度思考的问题，提升效率和准确性。

Method: 构建双机制数据集，采用多令牌预测增强的知识蒸馏，冷启动初始化策略，以及Step-SRPO强化学习算法。

Result: KAT在多个基准测试中表现优异，减少token使用约30%，并成功应用于实际开发工作流。

Conclusion: KAT展示了AutoThink范式的可扩展性，未来有望通过更大规模的模型进一步提升性能。

Abstract: We present Kwaipilot-AutoThink (KAT), an open-source 40B large language model
developed to address the overthinking problem in reasoning-intensive tasks,
where an automatic thinking training paradigm is proposed to dynamically switch
between reasoning and non-reasoning modes based on task complexity.
Specifically, first, we construct the dual-regime dataset based on a novel
tagging pipeline and a multi-agent synthesis strategy, and then we apply
Multi-Token Prediction (MTP)-enhanced knowledge distillation, enabling
efficient and fine-grained reasoning transfer with minimal pretraining cost.
Besides, we implement a cold-start initialization strategy that introduces
mode-selection priors using majority-vote signals and intent-aware prompting.
Finally, we propose Step-SRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that
incorporates intermediate supervision into the GRPO framework, offering
structured guidance over both reasoning-mode selection and response accuracy.
Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that KAT
consistently matches or even outperforms current state-of-the-art models,
including DeepSeek-R1-0528 and Qwen3-235B-A22B, across a wide range of
reasoning-intensive tasks while reducing token usage by up to approximately
30\%. Beyond academic evaluation, KAT has been successfully deployed in
Kwaipilot (i.e., Kuaishou's internal coding assistant), and improves real-world
development workflows with high accuracy, efficiency, and controllable
reasoning behaviors. Moreover, we are actively training a 200B
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with 40B activation parameters, where the early-stage
results already demonstrate promising improvements in performance and
efficiency, further showing the scalability of the AutoThink paradigm.

Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在文档图像机器翻译任务中表现不佳，且传统微调方法会导致模型遗忘其单语OCR能力。

Method: 提出SSR范式，在翻译前生成OCR文本，利用模型的单语OCR能力辅助跨语言翻译。

Result: 实验表明SSR有效减轻灾难性遗忘，提升了模型在OCR和文档图像机器翻译任务上的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SSR是一种有效的微调方法，能够同时保持和提升模型的多任务能力。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown strong performance in
document image tasks, especially Optical Character Recognition (OCR). However,
they struggle with Document Image Machine Translation (DIMT), which requires
handling both cross-modal and cross-lingual challenges. Previous efforts to
enhance DIMT capability through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on the DIMT
dataset often result in the forgetting of the model's existing monolingual
abilities, such as OCR. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel
fine-tuning paradigm, named Synchronously Self-Reviewing (SSR) its OCR
proficiency, inspired by the concept "Bilingual Cognitive Advantage".
Specifically, SSR prompts the model to generate OCR text before producing
translation text, which allows the model to leverage its strong monolingual OCR
ability while learning to translate text across languages. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate the proposed SSR learning helps mitigate catastrophic
forgetting, improving the generalization ability of MLLMs on both OCR and DIMT
tasks.

Abstract: The Patent-Based Idea Generation task asks systems to turn real patents into
product ideas viable within three years. We propose MK2, a prompt-centric
pipeline: Gemini 2.5 drafts and iteratively edits a prompt, grafting useful
fragments from weaker outputs; GPT-4.1 then uses this prompt to create one idea
per patent, and an Elo loop judged by Qwen3-8B selects the best prompt-all
without extra training data. Across three domains, two evaluator types, and six
criteria, MK2 topped the automatic leaderboard and won 25 of 36 tests. Only the
materials-chemistry track lagged, indicating the need for deeper domain
grounding; yet, the results show that lightweight prompt engineering has
already delivered competitive, commercially relevant ideation from patents.

Result: 知识蒸馏在有大教师模型时表现优于对比学习，但在教师模型能力相同时无优势。

Conclusion: 推荐在大教师模型可用时使用知识蒸馏，否则选择对比学习。

Abstract: Training text rerankers is crucial for information retrieval. Two primary
strategies are widely used: contrastive learning (optimizing directly on
ground-truth labels) and knowledge distillation (transferring knowledge from a
larger reranker). While both have been studied in the literature, a clear
comparison of their effectiveness for training cross-encoder rerankers under
practical conditions is needed.
  This paper empirically compares these strategies by training rerankers of
different sizes and architectures using both methods on the same data, with a
strong contrastive learning model acting as the distillation teacher. Our
results show that knowledge distillation generally yields better in-domain and
out-of-domain ranking performance than contrastive learning when distilling
from a larger teacher model. This finding is consistent across student model
sizes and architectures. However, distilling from a teacher of the same
capacity does not provide the same advantage, particularly for out-of-domain
tasks. These findings offer practical guidance for choosing a training strategy
based on available teacher models. Therefore, we recommend using knowledge
distillation to train smaller rerankers if a larger, more powerful teacher is
accessible; in its absence, contrastive learning provides a strong and more
reliable alternative otherwise.

Result: 提示方法和代理框架通过模拟长链思维提升LLMs性能；RLLMs因固有长链思维能力，常规方法效果有限；多语言对齐方法对LLMs有效但对RLLMs提升不大。

Conclusion: 研究为金融问答领域的LLMs和RLLMs提供了重要参考，指出当前方法的局限性。

Abstract: Recently, the development of large language models (LLMs) and reasoning large
language models (RLLMs) have gained considerable attention from many
researchers. RLLMs enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through Long
Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) processes, significantly improving the performance
of LLMs in addressing complex problems. However, there are few works that
systematically explore what methods can fully unlock the performance of LLMs
and RLLMs within the financial domain. To investigate the impact of various
methods on LLMs and RLLMs, we utilize five LLMs and three RLLMs to assess the
effects of prompting methods, agentic frameworks, and multilingual alignment
methods on financial question-answering tasks. Our research findings indicate:
(1) Current prompting methods and agent frameworks enhance the performance of
LLMs in financial question answering by simulating Long CoT; (2) RLLMs possess
inherent Long CoT capabilities, which limits the effectiveness of conventional
methods in further enhancing their performance; (3) Current advanced
multilingual alignment methods primarily improve the multilingual performance
of LLMs by extending the reasoning length, which yields minimal benefits for
RLLMs. We hope that this study can serve as an important reference for LLMs and
RLLMs in the field of financial question answering.

Method: 设计了一个大规模评估套件，涵盖八种语言和四种类型学家族，分析指标与人类判断的相关性。

Result: n-gram指标在融合语言中与人类评估相关性较低，而神经指标（如COMET）表现更优，尤其在低资源语言中。

Conclusion: n-gram指标在融合语言中存在局限性，建议更多投资于针对评估任务训练的神经指标。

Abstract: Automatic n-gram based metrics such as ROUGE are widely used for evaluating
generative tasks such as summarization. While these metrics are considered
indicative (even if imperfect) of human evaluation for English, their
suitability for other languages remains unclear. To address this, we
systematically assess evaluation metrics for generation both n-gram-based and
neural based to evaluate their effectiveness across languages and tasks.
Specifically, we design a large-scale evaluation suite across eight languages
from four typological families: agglutinative, isolating, low-fusional, and
high-fusional, spanning both low- and high-resource settings, to analyze their
correlation with human judgments. Our findings highlight the sensitivity of
evaluation metrics to the language type. For example, in fusional languages,
n-gram-based metrics show lower correlation with human assessments compared to
isolating and agglutinative languages. We also demonstrate that proper
tokenization can significantly mitigate this issue for morphologically rich
fusional languages, sometimes even reversing negative trends. Additionally, we
show that neural-based metrics specifically trained for evaluation, such as
COMET, consistently outperform other neural metrics and better correlate with
human judgments in low-resource languages. Overall, our analysis highlights the
limitations of n-gram metrics for fusional languages and advocates for greater
investment in neural-based metrics trained for evaluation tasks.

Result: 微调模型自身认为可信的生成数据比使用黄金数据更能减少幻觉，且模型内部判断作为过滤标准效果最佳。

Conclusion: 模型自身的信念可以作为提升生成文本事实性的有效信号，这一发现在多个领域均适用。

Abstract: Language models are prone to hallucination - generating text that is
factually incorrect. Finetuning models on high-quality factual information can
potentially reduce hallucination, but concerns remain; obtaining factual gold
data can be expensive and training on correct but unfamiliar data may
potentially lead to even more downstream hallucination. What data should
practitioners finetune on to mitigate hallucinations in language models? In
this work, we study the relationship between the factuality of finetuning data
and the prevalence of hallucinations in long-form generation tasks.
Counterintuitively, we find that finetuning on factual gold data is not as
helpful as finetuning on model-generated data that models believe to be
factual. Next, we evaluate filtering strategies applied on both factual gold
data and model-generated data, and find that finetuning on model-generated data
that is filtered by models' own internal judgments often leads to better
overall factuality compared to other configurations: training on gold data
filtered by models' judgments, training on gold data alone, or training on
model-generated data that is supported by gold data. These factuality
improvements transfer across three domains we study, suggesting that a models'
own beliefs can provide a powerful signal for factuality.

facts. We propose ChainEdit, a framework that synergizes knowledge
graph-derived logical rules with LLM logical reasoning capabilities to enable
systematic chain updates. By automatically extracting logical patterns from
structured knowledge bases and aligning them with LLMs' internal logics,
ChainEdit dynamically generates and edits logically connected knowledge
clusters. Experiments demonstrate an improvement of more than 30% in logical
generalization over baselines while preserving editing reliability and
specificity. We further address evaluation biases in existing benchmarks
through knowledge-aware protocols that disentangle external dependencies. This
work establishes new state-of-the-art performance on ripple effect while
ensuring internal logical consistency after knowledge editing.

Motivation: 主流LLM平台每天产生大量用户-模型交互，但现有评估模型缺乏错误归因能力，需开发自动化框架以高效分析模型表现和诊断错误。

Method: 建立包含6个主要和15个次要类别的Misattribution Framework，创建AttriData数据集，并基于此微调出MisAttributionLLM模型。

Result: 实验证实了方法的有效性和鲁棒性，MisAttributionLLM能同时生成评分、错误归因和反馈。

Conclusion: 该框架和模型为LLM的错误分析和诊断提供了系统化工具，填补了现有评估模型的不足。

Abstract: With the widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in various
tasks, the mainstream LLM platforms generate massive user-model interactions
daily. In order to efficiently analyze the performance of models and diagnose
failures in their answers, it is essential to develop an automated framework to
systematically categorize and attribute errors. However, existing evaluation
models lack error attribution capability. In this work, we establish a
comprehensive Misattribution Framework with 6 primary and 15 secondary
categories to facilitate in-depth analysis. Based on this framework, we present
AttriData, a dataset specifically designed for error attribution, encompassing
misattribution, along with the corresponding scores and feedback. We also
propose MisAttributionLLM, a fine-tuned model on AttriData, which is the first
general-purpose judge model capable of simultaneously generating score,
misattribution, and feedback. Extensive experiments and analyses are conducted
to confirm the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method.

TL;DR: 评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在奥地利和欧盟增值税法律框架下辅助法律决策的能力，发现其潜力但仍有局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在税务咨询中自动化决策的可行性，以减轻专业人员负担。

Method: 采用微调和检索增强生成（RAG）方法，测试LLMs在教科书案例和实际案例中的表现。

Result: LLMs能有效支持税务任务并提供法律依据，但无法完全自动化处理敏感法律问题。

Conclusion: LLMs在税务咨询中有潜力，但需进一步整合结构化背景信息以提升性能。

Abstract: This paper provides an experimental evaluation of the capability of large
language models (LLMs) to assist in legal decision-making within the framework
of Austrian and European Union value-added tax (VAT) law. In tax consulting
practice, clients often describe cases in natural language, making LLMs a prime
candidate for supporting automated decision-making and reducing the workload of
tax professionals. Given the requirement for legally grounded and
well-justified analyses, the propensity of LLMs to hallucinate presents a
considerable challenge. The experiments focus on two common methods for
enhancing LLM performance: fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG). In this study, these methods are applied on both textbook cases and
real-world cases from a tax consulting firm to systematically determine the
best configurations of LLM-based systems and assess the legal-reasoning
capabilities of LLMs. The findings highlight the potential of using LLMs to
support tax consultants by automating routine tasks and providing initial
analyses, although current prototypes are not ready for full automation due to
the sensitivity of the legal domain. The findings indicate that LLMs, when
properly configured, can effectively support tax professionals in VAT tasks and
provide legally grounded justifications for decisions. However, limitations
remain regarding the handling of implicit client knowledge and context-specific
documentation, underscoring the need for future integration of structured
background information.

achieving 4th in Track 1 (Multilingual ASR Task) and 1st place in Track 2
(Speech Separation and Recognition Task), showcasing the practical feasibility
and strong application potential of our approach.

Conclusion: 该研究为教育类文章连贯性的自动评分提供了一种潜在改进方法。

Abstract: Essays are considered a valuable mechanism for evaluating learning outcomes
in writing. Textual cohesion is an essential characteristic of a text, as it
facilitates the establishment of meaning between its parts. Automatically
scoring cohesion in essays presents a challenge in the field of educational
artificial intelligence. The machine learning algorithms used to evaluate texts
generally do not consider the individual characteristics of the instances that
comprise the analysed corpus. In this meaning, item response theory can be
adapted to the context of machine learning, characterising the ability,
difficulty and discrimination of the models used. This work proposes and
analyses the performance of a cohesion score prediction approach based on item
response theory to adjust the scores generated by machine learning models. In
this study, the corpus selected for the experiments consisted of the extended
Essay-BR, which includes 6,563 essays in the style of the National High School
Exam (ENEM), and the Brazilian Portuguese Narrative Essays, comprising 1,235
essays written by 5th to 9th grade students from public schools. We extracted
325 linguistic features and treated the problem as a machine learning
regression task. The experimental results indicate that the proposed approach
outperforms conventional machine learning models and ensemble methods in
several evaluation metrics. This research explores a potential approach for
improving the automatic evaluation of cohesion in educational essays.

Conclusion: clembench为模型评估提供了灵活、可控的新范式，易于扩展和使用。

Abstract: There are currently two main paradigms for evaluating large language models
(LLMs), reference-based evaluation and preference-based evaluation. The first,
carried over from the evaluation of machine learning models in general, relies
on pre-defined task instances, for which reference task executions are
available. The second, best exemplified by the LM-arena, relies on (often
self-selected) users bringing their own intents to a site that routes these to
several models in parallel, among whose responses the user then selects their
most preferred one. The former paradigm hence excels at control over what is
tested, while the latter comes with higher ecological validity, testing actual
use cases interactively. Recently, a third complementary paradigm has emerged
that combines some of the strengths of these approaches, offering control over
multi-turn, reference-free, repeatable interactions, while stressing
goal-directedness: dialogue game based evaluation. While the utility of this
approach has been shown by several projects, its adoption has been held back by
the lack of a mature, easily re-usable implementation. In this paper, we
present clembench, which has been in continuous development since 2023 and has
in its latest release been optimized for ease of general use. We describe how
it can be used to benchmark one's own models (using a provided set of benchmark
game instances in English), as well as how easily the benchmark itself can be
extended with new, tailor-made targeted tests.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have advanced procedural planning for
embodied AI systems through strong reasoning abilities, the integration of
multimodal inputs and counterfactual reasoning remains underexplored. To tackle
these challenges, we introduce LLaPa, a vision-language model framework
designed for multimodal procedural planning. LLaPa generates executable action
sequences from textual task descriptions and visual environmental images using
vision-language models (VLMs). Furthermore, we enhance LLaPa with two auxiliary
modules to improve procedural planning. The first module, the Task-Environment
Reranker (TER), leverages task-oriented segmentation to create a task-sensitive
feature space, aligning textual descriptions with visual environments and
emphasizing critical regions for procedural execution. The second module, the
Counterfactual Activities Retriever (CAR), identifies and emphasizes potential
counterfactual conditions, enhancing the model's reasoning capability in
counterfactual scenarios. Extensive experiments on ActPlan-1K and ALFRED
benchmarks demonstrate that LLaPa generates higher-quality plans with superior
LCS and correctness, outperforming advanced models. The code and models are

Motivation: 研究如何通过结合LLM提升LDA模型的性能，尤其是在初始化和后校正阶段，以验证LLM在文本挖掘中的实际效果。

Method: 在LDA的两个关键阶段（初始化和后校正）引入LLM，并通过实验评估其效果。

Result: LLM引导的初始化对LDA早期迭代有改进，但对收敛无影响且表现最差；LLM后校正在一致性评估中提升了5.86%。

Conclusion: LLM在某些阶段（如后校正）能有效提升LDA性能，但并非在所有情况下都优于传统方法，挑战了LLM总是更优的观点。

Abstract: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a prominent generative probabilistic
model used for uncovering abstract topics within document collections. In this
paper, we explore the effectiveness of augmenting topic models with Large
Language Models (LLMs) through integration into two key phases: Initialization
and Post-Correction. Since the LDA is highly dependent on the quality of its
initialization, we conduct extensive experiments on the LLM-guided topic
clustering for initializing the Gibbs sampling algorithm. Interestingly, the
experimental results reveal that while the proposed initialization strategy
improves the early iterations of LDA, it has no effect on the convergence and
yields the worst performance compared to the baselines. The LLM-enabled
post-correction, on the other hand, achieved a promising improvement of 5.86%
in the coherence evaluation. These results highlight the practical benefits of
the LLM-in-the-loop approach and challenge the belief that LLMs are always the
superior text mining alternative.

Abstract: This paper presents our system for SemEval 2025 Task 11: Bridging the Gap in
Text-Based Emotion Detection (Track A), which focuses on multi-label emotion
detection in short texts. We propose a feature-centric framework that
dynamically adapts document representations and learning algorithms to optimize
language-specific performance. Our study evaluates three key components:
document representation, dimensionality reduction, and model training in 28
languages, highlighting five for detailed analysis. The results show that
TF-IDF remains highly effective for low-resource languages, while contextual
embeddings like FastText and transformer-based document representations, such
as those produced by Sentence-BERT, exhibit language-specific strengths.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) reduces training time without compromising
performance, particularly benefiting FastText and neural models such as
Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP). Computational efficiency analysis underscores
the trade-off between model complexity and processing cost. Our framework
provides a scalable solution for multilingual emotion detection, addressing the
challenges of linguistic diversity and resource constraints.

Abstract: Argument mining (AM) is an interdisciplinary research field that integrates
insights from logic, philosophy, linguistics, rhetoric, law, psychology, and
computer science. It involves the automatic identification and extraction of
argumentative components, such as premises and claims, and the detection of
relationships between them, such as support, attack, or neutrality. Recently,
the field has advanced significantly, especially with the advent of large
language models (LLMs), which have enhanced the efficiency of analyzing and
extracting argument semantics compared to traditional methods and other deep
learning models. There are many benchmarks for testing and verifying the
quality of LLM, but there is still a lack of research and results on the
operation of these models in publicly available argument classification
databases. This paper presents a study of a selection of LLM's, using diverse
datasets such as Args.me and UKP. The models tested include versions of GPT,
Llama, and DeepSeek, along with reasoning-enhanced variants incorporating the
Chain-of-Thoughts algorithm. The results indicate that ChatGPT-4o outperforms
the others in the argument classification benchmarks. In case of models
incorporated with reasoning capabilities, the Deepseek-R1 shows its
superiority. However, despite their superiority, GPT-4o and Deepseek-R1 still
make errors. The most common errors are discussed for all models. To our
knowledge, the presented work is the first broader analysis of the mentioned
datasets using LLM and prompt algorithms. The work also shows some weaknesses
of known prompt algorithms in argument analysis, while indicating directions
for their improvement. The added value of the work is the in-depth analysis of
the available argument datasets and the demonstration of their shortcomings.

Motivation: 现实场景中，说话人归属任务通常依赖ASR生成的错误较多的转录文本，而非人工转录。研究旨在评估ASR转录错误对归属性能的影响。

Method: 通过对比ASR转录与人工转录的说话人归属性能，分析转录错误对任务的影响，并研究ASR系统特性如何影响归属结果。

Result: 研究发现，说话人归属对单词级转录错误具有较强鲁棒性，且ASR转录的归属性能与人工转录相当甚至更优，可能因为ASR错误揭示了说话人特征。

Conclusion: ASR生成的错误转录在说话人归属任务中表现良好，甚至优于人工转录，表明转录错误可能隐含说话人身份信息。

Abstract: Speaker attribution from speech transcripts is the task of identifying a
speaker from the transcript of their speech based on patterns in their language
use. This task is especially useful when the audio is unavailable (e.g.
deleted) or unreliable (e.g. anonymized speech). Prior work in this area has
primarily focused on the feasibility of attributing speakers using transcripts
produced by human annotators. However, in real-world settings, one often only
has more errorful transcripts produced by automatic speech recognition (ASR)
systems. In this paper, we conduct what is, to our knowledge, the first
comprehensive study of the impact of automatic transcription on speaker
attribution performance. In particular, we study the extent to which speaker
attribution performance degrades in the face of transcription errors, as well
as how properties of the ASR system impact attribution. We find that
attribution is surprisingly resilient to word-level transcription errors and
that the objective of recovering the true transcript is minimally correlated
with attribution performance. Overall, our findings suggest that speaker
attribution on more errorful transcripts produced by ASR is as good, if not
better, than attribution based on human-transcribed data, possibly because ASR
transcription errors can capture speaker-specific features revealing of speaker
identity.

Result: 生成了超过60,000个问题的平行语料库，在MiniF2F上达到88.9%的语法准确率，优于Deepseek-V3和Herald。

Conclusion: KELPS框架有效提升了非正式数学形式化的准确性和效率，为相关研究提供了新工具和数据支持。

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) show promising progress in formalizing
informal mathematics into machine-verifiable theorems. However, these methods
still face bottlenecks due to the limited quantity and quality of multilingual
parallel corpora. In this paper, we propose a novel neuro-symbolic framework
KELPS (Knowledge-Equation based Logical Processing System) to address these
problems. KELPS is an iterative framework for translating, synthesizing, and
filtering informal data into multiple formal languages (Lean, Coq, and
Isabelle). First, we translate natural language into Knowledge Equations (KEs),
a novel language that we designed, theoretically grounded in assertional logic.
Next, we convert them to target languages through rigorously defined rules that
preserve both syntactic structure and semantic meaning. This process yielded a
parallel corpus of over 60,000 problems. Our framework achieves 88.9% syntactic
accuracy (pass@1) on MiniF2F, outperforming SOTA models such as Deepseek-V3
(81%) and Herald (81.3%) across multiple datasets. All datasets and codes are

Result: 在五个基准测试中验证了KGA的优异知识融合性能。

Conclusion: KGA框架实现了无需参数更新的实时知识融合，显著提升了模型的适应性和性能。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) play a critical role in enhancing large language
models (LLMs) by introducing structured and grounded knowledge into the
learning process. However, most existing KG-enhanced approaches rely on
parameter-intensive fine-tuning, which risks catastrophic forgetting and
degrades the pretrained model's generalization. Moreover, they exhibit limited
adaptability to real-time knowledge updates due to their static integration
frameworks. To address these issues, we introduce the first test-time
KG-augmented framework for LLMs, built around a dedicated knowledge
graph-guided attention (KGA) module that enables dynamic knowledge fusion
without any parameter updates. The proposed KGA module augments the standard
self-attention mechanism with two synergistic pathways: outward and inward
aggregation. Specifically, the outward pathway dynamically integrates external
knowledge into input representations via input-driven KG fusion. This inward
aggregation complements the outward pathway by refining input representations
through KG-guided filtering, suppressing task-irrelevant signals and amplifying
knowledge-relevant patterns. Importantly, while the outward pathway handles
knowledge fusion, the inward path selects the most relevant triples and feeds
them back into the fusion process, forming a closed-loop enhancement mechanism.
By synergistically combining these two pathways, the proposed method supports
real-time knowledge fusion exclusively at test-time, without any parameter
modification. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks verify the comparable
knowledge fusion performance of KGA.

Conclusion: MM-Coder旨在通过多模态输入（文本和视觉设计）革新工业编程，提升LLMs的实用性。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly
improved code generation, yet most models remain text-only, neglecting crucial
visual aids like diagrams and flowcharts used in real-world software
development. To bridge this gap, we introduce MM-Coder, a Multilingual
Multimodal software developer. MM-Coder integrates visual design inputs-Unified
Modeling Language (UML) diagrams and flowcharts (termed Visual Workflow)-with
textual instructions to enhance code generation accuracy and architectural
alignment. To enable this, we developed MMc-Instruct, a diverse multimodal
instruction-tuning dataset including visual-workflow-based code generation,
allowing MM-Coder to synthesize textual and graphical information like human

significant remaining challenges for models in precise visual information
capture, instruction following, and advanced programming knowledge. Our work
aims to revolutionize industrial programming by enabling LLMs to interpret and

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级方法“cache steering”，通过直接干预键值缓存来隐式引导语言模型，无需微调或修改提示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过一次性干预提升小型语言模型的推理能力，使其具备更明确的多步推理能力。

Method: 利用GPT-4生成的推理轨迹构建引导向量，直接作用于键值缓存。

Result: 在多样化推理基准测试中，模型推理的质和量均得到提升。

Conclusion: 相比需要持续干预的激活引导技术，该方法在超参数稳定性、推理效率和集成便捷性上更具优势。

Abstract: We propose cache steering, a lightweight method for implicit steering of
language models via a one-shot intervention applied directly to the key-value
cache. To validate its effectiveness, we apply cache steering to induce
chain-of-thought reasoning in small language models. Our approach leverages
GPT-4o-generated reasoning traces to construct steering vectors that shift
model behavior toward more explicit, multi-step reasoning without fine-tuning
or prompt modifications. Experimental evaluations on diverse reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate that cache steering improves both the qualitative
structure of model reasoning and quantitative task performance. Compared to
prior activation steering techniques that require continuous interventions, our
one-shot cache steering offers substantial advantages in terms of
hyperparameter stability, inference-time efficiency, and ease of integration,
making it a more robust and practical solution for controlled generation.

Abstract: Precision agriculture relies heavily on accurate image analysis for crop
disease identification and treatment recommendation, yet existing
vision-language models (VLMs) often underperform in specialized agricultural
domains. This work presents a domain-aware framework for agricultural image
processing that combines prompt-based expert evaluation with self-consistency
mechanisms to enhance VLM reliability in precision agriculture applications. We
introduce two key innovations: (1) a prompt-based evaluation protocol that
configures a language model as an expert plant pathologist for scalable
assessment of image analysis outputs, and (2) a cosine-consistency self-voting
mechanism that generates multiple candidate responses from agricultural images
and selects the most semantically coherent diagnosis using domain-adapted
embeddings. Applied to maize leaf disease identification from field images
using a fine-tuned PaliGemma model, our approach improves diagnostic accuracy
from 82.2\% to 87.8\%, symptom analysis from 38.9\% to 52.2\%, and treatment
recommendation from 27.8\% to 43.3\% compared to standard greedy decoding. The
system remains compact enough for deployment on mobile devices, supporting
real-time agricultural decision-making in resource-constrained environments.
These results demonstrate significant potential for AI-driven precision
agriculture tools that can operate reliably in diverse field conditions.

Method: 提出基于2D位移估计的统一框架，利用大型视觉模型的全能特征提取器和跨领域数据集进行预训练。

Result: PanMatch在跨任务评估中优于UniMatch和Flow-Anything，在异常场景下表现出色。

Conclusion: PanMatch展示了统一框架在多任务和零样本场景中的潜力，为鲁棒匹配提供了新方向。

Abstract: This work presents PanMatch, a versatile foundation model for robust
correspondence matching. Unlike previous methods that rely on task-specific
architectures and domain-specific fine-tuning to support tasks like stereo
matching, optical flow or feature matching, our key insight is that any
two-frame correspondence matching task can be addressed within a 2D
displacement estimation framework using the same model weights. Such a
formulation eliminates the need for designing specialized unified architectures
or task-specific ensemble models. Instead, it achieves multi-task integration
by endowing displacement estimation algorithms with unprecedented
generalization capabilities. To this end, we highlight the importance of a
robust feature extractor applicable across multiple domains and tasks, and
propose the feature transformation pipeline that leverage all-purpose features
from Large Vision Models to endow matching baselines with zero-shot cross-view
matching capabilities. Furthermore, we assemble a cross-domain dataset with
near 1.8 million samples from stereo matching, optical flow, and feature
matching domains to pretrain PanMatch. We demonstrate the versatility of
PanMatch across a wide range of domains and downstream tasks using the same
model weights. Our model outperforms UniMatch and Flow-Anything on cross-task
evaluations, and achieves comparable performance to most state-of-the-art
task-specific algorithms on task-oriented benchmarks. Additionally, PanMatch
presents unprecedented zero-shot performance in abnormal scenarios, such as
rainy day and satellite imagery, where most existing robust algorithms fail to
yield meaningful results.

Abstract: The advancements in the domain of LLMs in recent years have surprised many,
showcasing their remarkable capabilities and diverse applications. Their
potential applications in various real-world scenarios have led to significant
research on their reliability and effectiveness. On the other hand, multimodal
LLMs and Text-to-Image models have only recently gained prominence, especially
when compared to text-only LLMs. Their reliability remains constrained due to
insufficient research on assessing their performance and robustness. This paper
aims to establish a comprehensive evaluation framework for Text-to-Image
models, concentrating particularly on their adherence to prompts. We created a
novel dataset that aimed to assess the robustness of these models in generating
images that conform to the specified factors of variation in the input text
prompts. Our evaluation studies present findings on three variants of Stable
Diffusion models: Stable Diffusion 3 Medium, Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large, and
Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large Turbo, and two variants of Janus models: Janus Pro
1B and Janus Pro 7B. We introduce a pipeline that leverages text descriptions
generated by the gpt-4o model for our ground-truth images, which are then used
to generate artificial images by passing these descriptions to the
Text-to-Image models. We then pass these generated images again through gpt-4o
using the same system prompt and compare the variation between the two
descriptions. Our results reveal that these models struggle to create simple
binary images with only two factors of variation: a simple geometric shape and
its location. We also show, using pre-trained VAEs on our dataset, that they
fail to generate images that follow our input dataset distribution.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CNTLoRA的数据驱动权重初始化方法，用于改进LoRA微调的收敛性和性能。


<details>

Motivation: 传统LoRA权重矩阵随机初始化且固定秩，限制了性能。

Method: 将LoRA初始化视为域转移问题，通过约束预训练和微调激活的关系，提出闭式解初始化权重。

Result: CNTLoRA在图像生成、分类和理解任务中优于标准方法。

Conclusion: CNTLoRA提供了更快收敛和更高性能的优化方案。

Abstract: Foundation models are pre-trained on large-scale datasets and subsequently
fine-tuned on small-scale datasets using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)
techniques like low-rank adapters (LoRA). In most previous works, LoRA weight
matrices are randomly initialized with a fixed rank across all attachment
points. In this paper, we improve convergence and final performance of LoRA
fine-tuning, using our proposed data-driven weight initialization method,
ConsNoTrainLoRA (CNTLoRA). We express LoRA initialization as a domain shift
problem where we use multiple constraints relating the pre-training and
fine-tuning activations. By reformulating these constraints, we obtain a
closed-form estimate of LoRA weights that depends on pre-training weights and
fine-tuning activation vectors and hence requires no training during
initialization. This weight estimate is decomposed to initialize the up and
down matrices with proposed flexibility of variable ranks. With the proposed
initialization method, we fine-tune on downstream tasks such as image
generation, image classification and image understanding. Both quantitative and
qualitative results demonstrate that CNTLoRA outperforms standard and
data-driven weight initialization methods. Extensive analyses and ablations
further elucidate the design choices of our framework, providing an optimal
recipe for faster convergence and enhanced performance.

Result: 在48个GPU上预训练后，Lumos-1在多个基准测试中表现优异，性能接近或超越现有模型。

Conclusion: Lumos-1通过创新的架构和训练策略，实现了高效且高质量的自回归视频生成。

Abstract: Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) have unified a vast range of
language tasks, inspiring preliminary efforts in autoregressive video
generation. Existing autoregressive video generators either diverge from
standard LLM architectures, depend on bulky external text encoders, or incur
prohibitive latency due to next-token decoding. In this paper, we introduce
Lumos-1, an autoregressive video generator that retains the LLM architecture
with minimal architectural modifications. To inject spatiotemporal correlations
in LLMs, we identify the efficacy of incorporating 3D RoPE and diagnose its
imbalanced frequency spectrum ranges. Therefore, we propose MM-RoPE, a RoPE
scheme that preserves the original textual RoPE while providing comprehensive
frequency spectra and scaled 3D positions for modeling multimodal
spatiotemporal data. Moreover, Lumos-1 resorts to a token dependency strategy
that obeys intra-frame bidirectionality and inter-frame temporal causality.
Based on this dependency strategy, we identify the issue of frame-wise loss
imbalance caused by spatial information redundancy and solve it by proposing
Autoregressive Discrete Diffusion Forcing (AR-DF). AR-DF introduces temporal
tube masking during training with a compatible inference-time masking policy to
avoid quality degradation. By using memory-efficient training techniques, we
pre-train Lumos-1 on only 48 GPUs, achieving performance comparable to EMU3 on
GenEval, COSMOS-Video2World on VBench-I2V, and OpenSoraPlan on VBench-T2V. Code

Conclusion: HML-ELM是一种高效且性能优越的分类方法，适用于无人机图像分类任务。

Abstract: Multilayer Extreme Learning Machine (ML-ELM) and its variants have proven to
be an effective technique for the classification of different natural signals
such as audio, video, acoustic and images. In this paper, a Hybrid Multilayer
Extreme Learning Machine (HML-ELM) that is based on ELM-based autoencoder
(ELM-AE) and an Interval Type-2 fuzzy Logic theory is suggested for active
image classification and applied to Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The
proposed methodology is a hierarchical ELM learning framework that consists of
two main phases: 1) self-taught feature extraction and 2) supervised feature
classification. First, unsupervised multilayer feature encoding is achieved by
stacking a number of ELM-AEs, in which input data is projected into a number of
high-level representations. At the second phase, the final features are
classified using a novel Simplified Interval Type-2 Fuzzy ELM (SIT2-FELM) with
a fast output reduction layer based on the SC algorithm; an improved version of
the algorithm Center of Sets Type Reducer without Sorting Requirement
(COSTRWSR). To validate the efficiency of the HML-ELM, two types of experiments
for the classification of images are suggested. First, the HML-ELM is applied
to solve a number of benchmark problems for image classification. Secondly, a
number of real experiments to the active classification and transport of four
different objects between two predefined locations using a UAV is implemented.
Experiments demonstrate that the proposed HML-ELM delivers a superior
efficiency compared to other similar methodologies such as ML-ELM, Multilayer
Fuzzy Extreme Learning Machine (ML-FELM) and ELM.

Abstract: The remarkable results for denoising in computer vision using diffusion
models given in \cite{SDWMG,HJA,HHG} yield a robust mathematical justification
for algorithms based on crucial properties of a sequence of Gaussian
independent $N(0,1)$ random variables. In particular the derivations use the
fact that a Gaussian distribution is determined by its mean and variance and
that the sum of two Gaussians is another Gaussian.
  \bigskip
  The issue raised in this short note is the following: suppose we use the
algorithm without any changes but replace the nature of the noise and use, for
instance, uniformly distributed noise or noise with a Beta distribution, or
noise which is a random superposition of two Gaussians with very different
variances. One could, of course, try to modify the algorithm keeping in mind
the nature of the noise, but this is not what we do. Instead we study the
performance of the algorithm when used with noise that is very far in nature
from the Gaussian case, where it is designed to work well.
  Usually these algorithms are implemented on very powerful computers. Our
experiments are all carried out on a small laptop and for the smallest possible
image size. Exploring how our observations are confirmed or changed when
dealing in different situations remains an interesting challenge.

Conclusion: 深度学习在跨城市和跨大陆的建筑高度估计中具有显著潜力，尤其是在欧洲城市表现优异。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of building heights using very high resolution (VHR)
synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery is crucial for various urban
applications. This paper introduces a Deep Learning (DL)-based methodology for
automated building height estimation from single VHR COSMO-SkyMed images: an
object-based regression approach based on bounding box detection followed by
height estimation. This model was trained and evaluated on a unique
multi-continental dataset comprising eight geographically diverse cities across
Europe, North and South America, and Asia, employing a cross-validation
strategy to explicitly assess out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. The
results demonstrate highly promising performance, particularly on European
cities where the model achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of approximately
one building story (2.20 m in Munich), significantly outperforming recent
state-of-the-art methods in similar OOD scenarios. Despite the increased
variability observed when generalizing to cities in other continents,
particularly in Asia with its distinct urban typologies and prevalence of
high-rise structures, this study underscores the significant potential of DL
for robust cross-city and cross-continental transfer learning in building
height estimation from single VHR SAR data.

Motivation: 现有基于优化的3DGS方法在稀疏视图下表现不佳，而前馈高斯方法受限于输入格式，难以扩展更多视图。

Method: 提出RegGS框架，利用熵正则化的Sinkhorn算法求解最优传输MW2距离，并结合光度一致性和深度几何进行联合配准。

Result: 在RE10K和ACID数据集上，RegGS实现了高保真的局部高斯配准，精确估计相机姿态并生成高质量新视图。

Conclusion: RegGS通过全局一致的高斯表示和联合配准模块，有效解决了稀疏视图重建的挑战。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated its potential in reconstructing
scenes from unposed images. However, optimization-based 3DGS methods struggle
with sparse views due to limited prior knowledge. Meanwhile, feed-forward
Gaussian approaches are constrained by input formats, making it challenging to
incorporate more input views. To address these challenges, we propose RegGS, a
3D Gaussian registration-based framework for reconstructing unposed sparse
views. RegGS aligns local 3D Gaussians generated by a feed-forward network into
a globally consistent 3D Gaussian representation. Technically, we implement an
entropy-regularized Sinkhorn algorithm to efficiently solve the optimal
transport Mixture 2-Wasserstein $(\text{MW}_2)$ distance, which serves as an
alignment metric for Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) in $\mathrm{Sim}(3)$ space.
Furthermore, we design a joint 3DGS registration module that integrates the
$\text{MW}_2$ distance, photometric consistency, and depth geometry. This
enables a coarse-to-fine registration process while accurately estimating
camera poses and aligning the scene. Experiments on the RE10K and ACID datasets
demonstrate that RegGS effectively registers local Gaussians with high
fidelity, achieving precise pose estimation and high-quality novel-view
synthesis. Project page: https://3dagentworld.github.io/reggs/.

Motivation: 传统3D重建方法假设静态对象或动态主体完全可见，在遮挡场景中性能下降。

Result: 在单目视频上验证，处理遮挡和时间稳定性优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了动态场景中复杂细节的恢复能力。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for reconstructing dynamic human-object
interactions from monocular video that overcomes challenges associated with
occlusions and temporal inconsistencies. Traditional 3D reconstruction methods
typically assume static objects or full visibility of dynamic subjects, leading
to degraded performance when these assumptions are violated-particularly in
scenarios where mutual occlusions occur. To address this, our framework
leverages amodal completion to infer the complete structure of partially
obscured regions. Unlike conventional approaches that operate on individual
frames, our method integrates temporal context, enforcing coherence across
video sequences to incrementally refine and stabilize reconstructions. This
template-free strategy adapts to varying conditions without relying on
predefined models, significantly enhancing the recovery of intricate details in
dynamic scenes. We validate our approach using 3D Gaussian Splatting on
challenging monocular videos, demonstrating superior precision in handling
occlusions and maintaining temporal stability compared to existing techniques.

Abstract: We propose Adaptive Diffusion Denoised Smoothing, a method for certifying the
predictions of a vision model against adversarial examples, while adapting to
the input. Our key insight is to reinterpret a guided denoising diffusion model
as a long sequence of adaptive Gaussian Differentially Private (GDP) mechanisms
refining a pure noise sample into an image. We show that these adaptive
mechanisms can be composed through a GDP privacy filter to analyze the
end-to-end robustness of the guided denoising process, yielding a provable
certification that extends the adaptive randomized smoothing analysis. We
demonstrate that our design, under a specific guiding strategy, can improve
both certified accuracy and standard accuracy on ImageNet for an $\ell_2$
threat model.

Conclusion: 该系统能有效帮助视障人士安全通行，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Visually impaired people face significant challenges in their day-to-day
commutes in the urban cities of Bangladesh due to the vast number of
obstructions on every path. With many injuries taking place through road
accidents on a daily basis, it is paramount for a system to be developed that
can alert the visually impaired of objects at close distance beforehand. To
overcome this issue, a novel alert system is proposed in this research to
assist the visually impaired in commuting through these busy streets without
colliding with any objects. The proposed system can alert the individual to
objects that are present at a close distance. It utilizes transfer learning to
train models for depth estimation and object detection, and combines both
models to introduce a novel system. The models are optimized through the
utilization of quantization techniques to make them lightweight and efficient,
allowing them to be easily deployed on embedded systems. The proposed solution
achieved a lightweight real-time depth estimation and object detection model
with an mAP50 of 0.801.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Hartley变换的HNOSeg-XS架构，解决了医学图像分割中CNN和Transformer的计算与分辨率限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNN和Transformer在医学图像分割中存在计算成本高、内存占用大或分辨率适应性差的问题。

Method: 通过可学习的偏微分方程建模图像分割，利用Hartley变换替代傅里叶变换，构建了HNOSeg-XS模型。

Result: 在多个数据集上测试，HNOSeg-XS表现出色，参数少（<34.7k）、推理快（<0.24s）、内存占用低（<1.8GiB）。

Conclusion: HNOSeg-XS是一种高效、分辨率鲁棒的医学图像分割方法。

Abstract: In medical image segmentation, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and
transformers are dominant. For CNNs, given the local receptive fields of
convolutional layers, long-range spatial correlations are captured through
consecutive convolutions and pooling. However, as the computational cost and
memory footprint can be prohibitively large, 3D models can only afford fewer
layers than 2D models with reduced receptive fields and abstract levels. For
transformers, although long-range correlations can be captured by multi-head
attention, its quadratic complexity with respect to input size is
computationally demanding. Therefore, either model may require input size
reduction to allow more filters and layers for better segmentation.
Nevertheless, given their discrete nature, models trained with patch-wise
training or image downsampling may produce suboptimal results when applied on
higher resolutions. To address this issue, here we propose the
resolution-robust HNOSeg-XS architecture. We model image segmentation by
learnable partial differential equations through the Fourier neural operator
which has the zero-shot super-resolution property. By replacing the Fourier
transform by the Hartley transform and reformulating the problem in the
frequency domain, we created the HNOSeg-XS model, which is resolution robust,
fast, memory efficient, and extremely parameter efficient. When tested on the
BraTS'23, KiTS'23, and MVSeg'23 datasets with a Tesla V100 GPU, HNOSeg-XS
showed its superior resolution robustness with fewer than 34.7k model
parameters. It also achieved the overall best inference time (< 0.24 s) and
memory efficiency (< 1.8 GiB) compared to the tested CNN and transformer
models.

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上表现优于StarDist-3D，实例参数化更紧凑。

Conclusion: SurfDist证明了可解释的实例表面模型可以与实例成员关系一起有效学习。

Abstract: We present SurfDist, a convolutional neural network architecture for
three-dimensional volumetric instance segmentation. SurfDist enables prediction
of instances represented as closed surfaces composed of smooth parametric
surface patches, specifically bicubic B\'ezier triangles. SurfDist is a
modification of the popular model architecture StarDist-3D which breaks
StarDist-3D's coupling of instance parameterization dimension and instance
voxel resolution, and it produces predictions which may be upsampled to
arbitrarily high resolutions without introduction of voxelization artifacts.
  For datasets with blob-shaped instances, common in biomedical imaging,
SurfDist can outperform StarDist-3D with more compact instance
parameterizations. We detail SurfDist's technical implementation and show one
synthetic and one real-world dataset for which it outperforms StarDist-3D.
These results demonstrate that interpretable instance surface models can be
learned effectively alongside instance membership.

significantly underperform relative to vision-based models. Our final model
outperformed both competition baselines and highlighted the effectiveness of
domain specific pretraining and balanced sampling strategies. Our approach
ranked 35/74 on the private test set in post-completion evaluation, this

Motivation: 临床中缺乏客观测量运动的方法，限制了生物力学数据的应用。PBL旨在填补这一空白，提供便捷的工具。

Method: PBL包括智能手机应用和算法，用于收集和分析运动数据，并在多种临床环境中验证其准确性。

Result: PBL的关节角度误差在3度以内，步态指标可靠且敏感，能捕捉临床差异。

Conclusion: PBL为临床提供了一种可扩展、低负担的生物力学测量工具，有望改善运动障碍的监测。

Abstract: The way a person moves is a direct reflection of their neurological and
musculoskeletal health, yet it remains one of the most underutilized vital
signs in clinical practice. Although clinicians visually observe movement
impairments, they lack accessible and validated methods to objectively measure
movement in routine care. This gap prevents wider use of biomechanical
measurements in practice, which could enable more sensitive outcome measures or
earlier identification of impairment. We present our Portable Biomechanics
Laboratory (PBL), which includes a secure, cloud-enabled smartphone app for
data collection and a novel algorithm for fitting biomechanical models to this
data. We extensively validated PBL's biomechanical measures using a large,
clinically representative dataset. Next, we tested the usability and utility of
our system in neurosurgery and sports medicine clinics. We found joint angle
errors within 3 degrees across participants with neurological injury,
lower-limb prosthesis users, pediatric inpatients, and controls. In addition to
being easy to use, gait metrics computed from the PBL showed high reliability
and were sensitive to clinical differences. For example, in individuals
undergoing decompression surgery for cervical myelopathy, the mJOA score is a
common patient-reported outcome measure; we found that PBL gait metrics
correlated with mJOA scores and demonstrated greater responsiveness to surgical
intervention than the patient-reported outcomes. These findings support the use
of handheld smartphone video as a scalable, low-burden tool for capturing
clinically meaningful biomechanical data, offering a promising path toward
accessible monitoring of mobility impairments. We release the first clinically
validated method for measuring whole-body kinematics from handheld smartphone
video at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAR分辨率提升导致散射特性差异增大，影响目标检测模型的泛化能力，现有领域适应技术存在盲特征适应和不可靠语义传播问题。

Method: CR-Net结合了SHFA模块（结构感知特征适应）和RSAA模块（可靠语义对齐），通过结构先验和证据学习理论优化跨分辨率检测。

Result: 实验表明，CR-Net在跨分辨率SAR目标检测中显著提升了性能，达到了SOTA水平。

Conclusion: CR-Net通过保留域内结构和提升判别能力，有效解决了跨分辨率SAR目标检测的挑战。

Abstract: In recent years, continuous improvements in SAR resolution have significantly
benefited applications such as urban monitoring and target detection. However,
the improvement in resolution leads to increased discrepancies in scattering
characteristics, posing challenges to the generalization ability of target
detection models. While domain adaptation technology is a potential solution,
the inevitable discrepancies caused by resolution differences often lead to
blind feature adaptation and unreliable semantic propagation, ultimately
degrading the domain adaptation performance. To address these challenges, this
paper proposes a novel SAR target detection method (termed CR-Net), that
incorporates structure priors and evidential learning theory into the detection
model, enabling reliable domain adaptation for cross-resolution detection. To
be specific, CR-Net integrates Structure-induced Hierarchical Feature
Adaptation (SHFA) and Reliable Structural Adjacency Alignment (RSAA). SHFA
module is introduced to establish structural correlations between targets and
achieve structure-aware feature adaptation, thereby enhancing the
interpretability of the feature adaptation process. Afterwards, the RSAA module
is proposed to enhance reliable semantic alignment, by leveraging the secure
adjacency set to transfer valuable discriminative knowledge from the source
domain to the target domain. This further improves the discriminability of the
detection model in the target domain. Based on experimental results from
different-resolution datasets,the proposed CR-Net significantly enhances
cross-resolution adaptation by preserving intra-domain structures and improving
discriminability. It achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in
cross-resolution SAR target detection.

Conclusion: M2DAO-Talker通过系统化框架和优化策略，显著提升了说话头生成的视觉效果和效率。

Abstract: Audio-driven talking head generation holds significant potential for film
production. While existing 3D methods have advanced motion modeling and content
synthesis, they often produce rendering artifacts, such as motion blur,
temporal jitter, and local penetration, due to limitations in representing
stable, fine-grained motion fields. Through systematic analysis, we reformulate
talking head generation into a unified framework comprising three steps: video
preprocessing, motion representation, and rendering reconstruction. This
framework underpins our proposed M2DAO-Talker, which addresses current
limitations via multi-granular motion decoupling and alternating
optimization.Specifically, we devise a novel 2D portrait preprocessing pipeline
to extract frame-wise deformation control conditions (motion region
segmentation masks, and camera parameters) to facilitate motion representation.
To ameliorate motion modeling, we elaborate a multi-granular motion decoupling
strategy, which independently models non-rigid (oral and facial) and rigid
(head) motions for improved reconstruction accuracy.Meanwhile, a motion
consistency constraint is developed to ensure head-torso kinematic consistency,
thereby mitigating penetration artifacts caused by motion aliasing. In
addition, an alternating optimization strategy is designed to iteratively
refine facial and oral motion parameters, enabling more realistic video
generation.Experiments across multiple datasets show that M2DAO-Talker achieves
state-of-the-art performance, with the 2.43 dB PSNR improvement in generation
quality and 0.64 gain in user-evaluated video realness versus TalkingGaussian
while with 150 FPS inference speed. Our project homepage is

Abstract: Craniofacial reconstruction in forensic science is crucial for the
identification of the victims of crimes and disasters. The objective is to map
a given skull to its corresponding face in a corpus of faces with known
identities using recent advancements in computer vision, such as deep learning.
In this paper, we presented a framework for the identification of a person
given the X-ray image of a skull using convolutional Siamese networks for
cross-domain identity representation. Siamese networks are twin networks that
share the same architecture and can be trained to discover a feature space
where nearby observations that are similar are grouped and dissimilar
observations are moved apart. To do this, the network is exposed to two sets of
comparable and different data. The Euclidean distance is then minimized between
similar pairs and maximized between dissimilar ones. Since getting pairs of
skull and face images are difficult, we prepared our own dataset of 40
volunteers whose front and side skull X-ray images and optical face images were
collected. Experiments were conducted on the collected cross-domain dataset to
train and validate the Siamese networks. The experimental results provide
satisfactory results on the identification of a person from the given skull.

Motivation: 深度学习在医学图像分析中取得进展，但模型大且不透明限制了临床应用。

Method: 利用可解释性技术（如DL-Backtrace等）指导剪枝，选择性保留每层最相关部分。

Result: 在多个医学图像分类基准上实现高压缩率且精度损失最小。

Conclusion: 该方法为医疗场景中轻量级、可解释模型的部署提供了可能。

Abstract: Deep learning has driven significant advances in medical image analysis, yet
its adoption in clinical practice remains constrained by the large size and
lack of transparency in modern models. Advances in interpretability techniques
such as DL-Backtrace, Layer-wise Relevance Propagation, and Integrated
Gradients make it possible to assess the contribution of individual components
within neural networks trained on medical imaging tasks. In this work, we
introduce an interpretability-guided pruning framework that reduces model
complexity while preserving both predictive performance and transparency. By
selectively retaining only the most relevant parts of each layer, our method
enables targeted compression that maintains clinically meaningful
representations. Experiments across multiple medical image classification
benchmarks demonstrate that this approach achieves high compression rates with
minimal loss in accuracy, paving the way for lightweight, interpretable models
suited for real-world deployment in healthcare settings.

Conclusion: CoCo-Bot通过消除辅助线索，显著提升了生成模型的解释性和组合性。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) provide interpretable and controllable
generative modeling by routing generation through explicit,
human-understandable concepts. However, previous generative CBMs often rely on
auxiliary visual cues at the bottleneck to compensate for information not
captured by the concepts, which undermines interpretability and
compositionality. We propose CoCo-Bot, a post-hoc, composable concept
bottleneck generative model that eliminates the need for auxiliary cues by
transmitting all information solely through explicit concepts. Guided by
diffusion-based energy functions, CoCo-Bot supports robust post-hoc
interventions-such as concept composition and negation-across arbitrary
concepts. Experiments using StyleGAN2 pre-trained on CelebA-HQ show that
CoCo-Bot improves concept-level controllability and interpretability, while
maintaining competitive visual quality.

Conclusion: 为跨癌症多模态预后提供了实用且稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning has shown remarkable performance in integrating multimodal data
for survival prediction. However, existing multimodal methods mainly focus on
single cancer types and overlook the challenge of generalization across
cancers. In this work, we are the first to reveal that multimodal prognosis
models often generalize worse than unimodal ones in cross-cancer scenarios,
despite the critical need for such robustness in clinical practice. To address
this, we propose a new task: Cross-Cancer Single Domain Generalization for
Multimodal Prognosis, which evaluates whether models trained on a single cancer
type can generalize to unseen cancers. We identify two key challenges: degraded
features from weaker modalities and ineffective multimodal integration. To
tackle these, we introduce two plug-and-play modules: Sparse Dirac Information
Rebalancer (SDIR) and Cancer-aware Distribution Entanglement (CADE). SDIR
mitigates the dominance of strong features by applying Bernoulli-based
sparsification and Dirac-inspired stabilization to enhance weaker modality
signals. CADE, designed to synthesize the target domain distribution, fuses
local morphological cues and global gene expression in latent space.
Experiments on a four-cancer-type benchmark demonstrate superior
generalization, laying the foundation for practical, robust cross-cancer
multimodal prognosis. Code is available at

Conclusion: MRAG通过多范围表示和对抗性扰动，显著提升了隐写图像的隐蔽性和恢复能力。

Abstract: Deep hiding has been exploring the hiding capability of deep learning-based
models, aiming to conceal image-level messages into cover images and reveal
them from generated stego images. Existing schemes are easily detected by
steganalyzers due to their large payloads and their limitation to feature
extraction based solely on either pure convolution or pure transformer
operators within a single range, as well as pixel-level loss constraints. To
address the issue, in this paper, we introduce generation-based adversarial
attacks into color JPEG image deep hiding and propose a multi-range
representations-driven adversarial stego generation framework called MRAG from
a steganalysis perspective. Specifically, we integrate the local-range neighbor
reception characteristic of the convolution and the global-range dependency
modeling of the transformer to construct MRAG. Meanwhile, we use the
transformed images obtained through coarse-grained and fine-grained frequency
decomposition as inputs, introducing multi-grained information. Furthermore, a
features angle-norm disentanglement loss is designed to constrain the generated
stegos closer to covers in the angle and norm space of the steganalyzer's
classified features. Consequently, small yet effective adversarial
perturbations can be injected into the process of generating stegos, ensuring
that stegos maintain favorable secret restorability and imperceptibility.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MRAG can achieve state-of-the-art
performance.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Cycle Context Verification (CCV)的新框架，通过自我验证预测和增强上下文对齐，改进了基于上下文学习（ICL）的医学图像分割方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在临床场景中，由于注释医学图像的稀缺性，选择最优的上下文图像-掩码对具有挑战性，且微调基础ICL模型因计算成本和灾难性遗忘风险而不可行。

Method: CCV采用循环流程，首先生成查询图像的分割掩码，随后交换查询和上下文对的角色以验证预测，并通过查询特定提示改进对齐。

Result: 在七个医学图像分割数据集上评估CCV，证明其优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CCV增强了基于ICL的分割能力，为通用医学图像分割提供了稳健解决方案。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is emerging as a promising technique for achieving
universal medical image segmentation, where a variety of objects of interest
across imaging modalities can be segmented using a single model. Nevertheless,
its performance is highly sensitive to the alignment between the query image
and in-context image-mask pairs. In a clinical scenario, the scarcity of
annotated medical images makes it challenging to select optimal in-context
pairs, and fine-tuning foundation ICL models on contextual data is infeasible
due to computational costs and the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To address
this challenge, we propose Cycle Context Verification (CCV), a novel framework
that enhances ICL-based medical image segmentation by enabling
self-verification of predictions and accordingly enhancing contextual
alignment. Specifically, CCV employs a cyclic pipeline in which the model
initially generates a segmentation mask for the query image. Subsequently, the
roles of the query and an in-context pair are swapped, allowing the model to
validate its prediction by predicting the mask of the original in-context
image. The accuracy of this secondary prediction serves as an implicit measure
of the initial query segmentation. A query-specific prompt is introduced to
alter the query image and updated to improve the measure, thereby enhancing the
alignment between the query and in-context pairs. We evaluated CCV on seven
medical image segmentation datasets using two ICL foundation models,
demonstrating its superiority over existing methods. Our results highlight
CCV's ability to enhance ICL-based segmentation, making it a robust solution
for universal medical image segmentation. The code will be available at

Result: 提示设计显著影响性能，多样本提示下交叉口可见性召回率从21.7%提升至57.0%，交通密度一致性从53.5%增至67.6%。停车标志检测精度高（86.3%），但召回率较低（76.7%）。

Conclusion: 研究表明，精心设计的提示可使大语言模型成为驾驶风险评估的有力辅助工具，未来需扩展数据集和模型架构以提升适用性。

Abstract: This study investigates the potential of a multimodal large language model
(LLM), specifically ChatGPT-4o, to perform human-like interpretations of
traffic scenes using static dashcam images. Herein, we focus on three judgment
tasks relevant to elderly driver assessments: evaluating traffic density,
assessing intersection visibility, and recognizing stop signs recognition.
These tasks require contextual reasoning rather than simple object detection.
Using zero-shot, few-shot, and multi-shot prompting strategies, we evaluated
the performance of the model with human annotations serving as the reference
standard. Evaluation metrics included precision, recall, and F1-score. Results
indicate that prompt design considerably affects performance, with recall for
intersection visibility increasing from 21.7% (zero-shot) to 57.0%
(multi-shot). For traffic density, agreement increased from 53.5% to 67.6%. In
stop-sign detection, the model demonstrated high precision (up to 86.3%) but a
lower recall (approximately 76.7%), indicating a conservative response
tendency. Output stability analysis revealed that humans and the model faced
difficulties interpreting structurally ambiguous scenes. However, the model's
explanatory texts corresponded with its predictions, enhancing
interpretability. These findings suggest that, with well-designed prompts, LLMs
hold promise as supportive tools for scene-level driving risk assessments.
Future studies should explore scalability using larger datasets, diverse
annotators, and next-generation model architectures for elderly driver
assessments.

Motivation: 传统方法将低光增强与视觉理解分开处理，限制了泛化能力和可扩展性。本文旨在构建一个通用的桥梁，解决这些问题。

Method: 利用预训练的生成扩散模型优化图像，提出SCUF方法，包括光照感知图像提示和循环注意力适配器，以及语义一致性学习。

Result: 在图像质量和GEFU任务（分类、检测、语义分割）中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GEFU方法成功地将低光增强与视觉理解结合，提升了泛化能力和可扩展性。

Abstract: Low-level enhancement and high-level visual understanding in low-light vision
have traditionally been treated separately. Low-light enhancement improves
image quality for downstream tasks, but existing methods rely on physical or
geometric priors, limiting generalization. Evaluation mainly focuses on visual
quality rather than downstream performance. Low-light visual understanding,
constrained by scarce labeled data, primarily uses task-specific domain
adaptation, which lacks scalability. To address these challenges, we build a
generalized bridge between low-light enhancement and low-light understanding,
which we term Generalized Enhancement For Understanding (GEFU). This paradigm
improves both generalization and scalability. To address the diverse causes of
low-light degradation, we leverage pretrained generative diffusion models to
optimize images, achieving zero-shot generalization performance. Building on
this, we propose Semantically Consistent Unsupervised Fine-tuning (SCUF).
Specifically, to overcome text prompt limitations, we introduce an
illumination-aware image prompt to explicitly guide image generation and
propose a cycle-attention adapter to maximize its semantic potential. To
mitigate semantic degradation in unsupervised training, we propose caption and
reflectance consistency to learn high-level semantics and image-level spatial
semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method
outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in traditional image quality and
GEFU tasks including classification, detection, and semantic segmentation.

Abstract: Real-world applications of computer vision in the humanities require
algorithms to be robust against artistic abstraction, peripheral objects, and
subtle differences between fine-grained target classes. Existing datasets
provide instance-level annotations on artworks but are generally biased towards
the image centre and limited with regard to detailed object classes. The
proposed ODOR dataset fills this gap, offering 38,116 object-level annotations

such as a detailed set of categories, dense and overlapping objects, and
spatial distribution over the whole image canvas. Furthermore, we provide an
extensive baseline analysis for object detection models and highlight the
challenging properties of the dataset through a set of secondary studies.
Inspiring further research on artwork object detection and broader visual
cultural heritage studies, the dataset challenges researchers to explore the
intersection of object recognition and smell perception.

Motivation: 解决现有文本到图像模型在主题一致性生成（SCG）中牺牲布局和姿势多样性的问题。

Method: 采用两阶段策略：Identity Transport（IT）和Identity Refinement（IR），分别处理早期和后期去噪步骤。

Result: 在主题一致性、姿势多样性和提示保真度上表现优异。

Conclusion: CoDi在视觉感知和性能指标上均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Subject-consistent generation (SCG)-aiming to maintain a consistent subject
identity across diverse scenes-remains a challenge for text-to-image (T2I)
models. Existing training-free SCG methods often achieve consistency at the
cost of layout and pose diversity, hindering expressive visual storytelling. To
address the limitation, we propose subject-Consistent and pose-Diverse T2I
framework, dubbed as CoDi, that enables consistent subject generation with
diverse pose and layout. Motivated by the progressive nature of diffusion,
where coarse structures emerge early and fine details are refined later, CoDi
adopts a two-stage strategy: Identity Transport (IT) and Identity Refinement
(IR). IT operates in the early denoising steps, using optimal transport to
transfer identity features to each target image in a pose-aware manner. This
promotes subject consistency while preserving pose diversity. IR is applied in
the later denoising steps, selecting the most salient identity features to
further refine subject details. Extensive qualitative and quantitative results
on subject consistency, pose diversity, and prompt fidelity demonstrate that
CoDi achieves both better visual perception and stronger performance across all
metrics. The code is provided in https://github.com/NJU-PCALab/CoDi.

Method: 提出三阶段框架SHC：1）分类网络识别语义相似性；2）优化算法生成语义哈希中心；3）训练深度哈希网络生成二进制哈希码。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上，SHC在MAP@100、MAP@1000和MAP@ALL指标上分别平均提升7.26%、7.62%和11.71%。

Conclusion: SHC通过语义哈希中心有效保留语义结构，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Deep hashing is an effective approach for large-scale image retrieval.
Current methods are typically classified by their supervision types:
point-wise, pair-wise, and list-wise. Recent point-wise techniques (e.g., CSQ,
MDS) have improved retrieval performance by pre-assigning a hash center to each
class, enhancing the discriminability of hash codes across various datasets.
However, these methods rely on data-independent algorithms to generate hash
centers, which neglect the semantic relationships between classes and may
degrade retrieval performance.
  This paper introduces the concept of semantic hash centers, building on the
idea of traditional hash centers. We hypothesize that hash centers of
semantically related classes should have closer Hamming distances, while those
of unrelated classes should be more distant. To this end, we propose a
three-stage framework, SHC, to generate hash codes that preserve semantic
structure.
  First, we develop a classification network to identify semantic similarities
between classes using a data-dependent similarity calculation that adapts to
varying data distributions. Second, we introduce an optimization algorithm to
generate semantic hash centers, preserving semantic relatedness while enforcing
a minimum distance between centers to avoid excessively similar hash codes.
Finally, a deep hashing network is trained using these semantic centers to
convert images into binary hash codes.
  Experimental results on large-scale retrieval tasks across several public
datasets show that SHC significantly improves retrieval performance.
Specifically, SHC achieves average improvements of +7.26%, +7.62%, and +11.71%
in MAP@100, MAP@1000, and MAP@ALL metrics, respectively, over state-of-the-art
methods.

TL;DR: MuGCP提出了一种新的条件提示学习范式，通过多模态大语言模型生成语义条件提示，并结合视觉条件提示，提升视觉语言模型在新类别上的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决提示学习中类别嵌入分布建模不足和跨模态对齐局限于输出层的问题。

Method: 利用多模态大语言模型生成语义条件提示（SCP），引入注意力互导模块（AMG）生成视觉条件提示（VCP），并通过多提示融合机制（MPF）整合提示。

Result: 在14个数据集上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MuGCP通过多模态互导条件提示学习，显著提升了视觉语言模型的性能。

Abstract: Prompt learning facilitates the efficient adaptation of Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) to various downstream tasks. However, it faces two significant
challenges: (1) inadequate modeling of class embedding distributions for unseen
instances, leading to suboptimal generalization on novel classes; (2)
prevailing methodologies predominantly confine cross-modal alignment to the
final output layer of vision and text encoders, which fundamentally limits
their capacity to preserve topological consistency with pre-trained multi-modal
embedding spaces. To this end, we introduce MuGCP (Multi-modal Mutual-Guidance
Conditional Prompt Learning), a novel paradigm designed for conditional prompt
generation. MuGCP leverages Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as
conditional prompt learners to adaptively generate Semantic Conditional Prompts
(SCP) that incorporate rich, fine-grained high-level semantic knowledge for
image instances. To ensure effective alignment and interaction across the
multi-modal space of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), we introduce the Attention
Mutual-Guidance (AMG) module, which facilitates interactions between visual and
semantic information. Through mutual guidance, the AMG module generates Visual
Conditional Prompts (VCP), enhancing the model's performance in multi-modal
tasks. Additionally, we present a Multi-Prompt Fusion (MPF) mechanism that
integrates SCP and VCP with contextual prompts, ensuring seamless coordination
among the different prompts and enhancing the modeling of class embeddings and
instance-specific knowledge. Our MuGCP outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods on 14 different datasets. The code will be made available after
publication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能自然识别和补全遮挡物体，但机器人缺乏类似能力。现有技术将场景视为整体，难以从部分观察中识别完整对象。

Method: 开发了空间对比学习技术，通过追踪实例在多视图中的栅格化来增强语义监督；引入原位生成技术，利用观察和几何线索指导3D生成模型完成对象重建。

Result: 在真实和合成场景中，该方法在场景分解和对象补全方面表现出色，分解精度高且对象几何和视觉完整性好。

Conclusion: InstaScene通过创新技术实现了复杂场景的实例分解和完整重建，为机器人3D感知提供了新思路。

Abstract: Humans can naturally identify and mentally complete occluded objects in
cluttered environments. However, imparting similar cognitive ability to
robotics remains challenging even with advanced reconstruction techniques,
which models scenes as undifferentiated wholes and fails to recognize complete
object from partial observations. In this paper, we propose InstaScene, a new
paradigm towards holistic 3D perception of complex scenes with a primary goal:
decomposing arbitrary instances while ensuring complete reconstruction. To
achieve precise decomposition, we develop a novel spatial contrastive learning
by tracing rasterization of each instance across views, significantly enhancing
semantic supervision in cluttered scenes. To overcome incompleteness from
limited observations, we introduce in-situ generation that harnesses valuable
observations and geometric cues, effectively guiding 3D generative models to
reconstruct complete instances that seamlessly align with the real world.
Experiments on scene decomposition and object completion across complex
real-world and synthetic scenes demonstrate that our method achieves superior
decomposition accuracy while producing geometrically faithful and visually
intact objects.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为RALU的训练免费框架，通过空间维度加速扩散变换器的推理，显著减少计算量，同时保持图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散变换器虽然在高保真图像和视频生成中表现出色，但计算量大，阻碍了实际部署。现有加速方法主要利用时间维度，而RALU则从空间维度入手。

Method: RALU分为三个阶段：低分辨率去噪、区域自适应上采样和全分辨率上采样，结合噪声时间步重调度以稳定生成。

Result: 在FLUX上实现了7.0倍加速，在Stable Diffusion 3上实现了3.0倍加速，且图像质量几乎无损。

Conclusion: RALU是一种高效的空间维度加速方法，可与现有时间维度加速方法互补，进一步降低推理延迟。

Abstract: Diffusion transformers have emerged as an alternative to U-net-based
diffusion models for high-fidelity image and video generation, offering
superior scalability. However, their heavy computation remains a major obstacle
to real-world deployment. Existing acceleration methods primarily exploit the
temporal dimension such as reusing cached features across diffusion timesteps.
Here, we propose Region-Adaptive Latent Upsampling (RALU), a training-free
framework that accelerates inference along spatial dimension. RALU performs
mixed-resolution sampling across three stages: 1) low-resolution denoising
latent diffusion to efficiently capture global semantic structure, 2)
region-adaptive upsampling on specific regions prone to artifacts at
full-resolution, and 3) all latent upsampling at full-resolution for detail
refinement. To stabilize generations across resolution transitions, we leverage
noise-timestep rescheduling to adapt the noise level across varying
resolutions. Our method significantly reduces computation while preserving
image quality by achieving up to 7.0$\times$ speed-up on FLUX and 3.0$\times$
on Stable Diffusion 3 with minimal degradation. Furthermore, RALU is
complementary to existing temporal accelerations such as caching methods, thus
can be seamlessly integrated to further reduce inference latency without
compromising generation quality.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在复杂场景中能可靠地生成真实且感知一致的结果。

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提升了修复场景的几何和外观一致性。

Abstract: Radiance field methods, such as Neural Radiance Field or 3D Gaussian
Splatting, have emerged as seminal 3D representations for synthesizing
realistic novel views. For practical applications, there is ongoing research on
flexible scene editing techniques, among which object removal is a
representative task. However, removing objects exposes occluded regions, often
leading to unnatural appearances. Thus, studies have employed image inpainting
techniques to replace such regions with plausible content - a task referred to
as 3D scene inpainting. However, image inpainting methods produce one of many
plausible completions for each view, leading to inconsistencies between
viewpoints. A widely adopted approach leverages perceptual cues to blend
inpainted views smoothly. However, it is prone to detail loss and can fail when
there are perceptual inconsistencies across views. In this paper, we propose a
novel 3D scene inpainting method that reliably produces realistic and
perceptually consistent results even for complex scenes by leveraging a
reference view. Given the inpainted reference view, we estimate the inpainting
similarity of the other views to adjust their contribution in constructing an
accurate geometry tailored to the reference. This geometry is then used to warp
the reference inpainting to other views as pseudo-ground truth, guiding the
optimization to match the reference appearance. Comparative evaluation studies
have shown that our approach improves both the geometric fidelity and
appearance consistency of inpainted scenes.

Conclusion: VFMTok通过创新设计提升了图像分词器的性能，为社区提供了高效工具。

Abstract: Leveraging the powerful representations of pre-trained vision foundation
models -- traditionally used for visual comprehension -- we explore a novel
direction: building an image tokenizer directly atop such models, a largely
underexplored area. Specifically, we employ a frozen vision foundation model as
the encoder of our tokenizer. To enhance its effectiveness, we introduce two
key components: (1) a region-adaptive quantization framework that reduces
redundancy in the pre-trained features on regular 2D grids, and (2) a semantic
reconstruction objective that aligns the tokenizer's outputs with the
foundation model's representations to preserve semantic fidelity. Based on
these designs, our proposed image tokenizer, VFMTok, achieves substantial
improvements in image reconstruction and generation quality, while also
enhancing token efficiency. It further boosts autoregressive (AR) generation --
achieving a gFID of 2.07 on ImageNet benchmarks, while accelerating model
convergence by three times, and enabling high-fidelity class-conditional
synthesis without the need for classifier-free guidance (CFG). The code will be
released publicly to benefit the community.

Conclusion: 深度学习驱动的3D重建技术前景广阔，未来需解决模型精度、扩展性及动态场景适应性等关键问题。

Abstract: 3D reconstruction, which aims to recover the dense three-dimensional
structure of a scene, is a cornerstone technology for numerous applications,
including augmented/virtual reality, autonomous driving, and robotics. While
traditional pipelines like Structure from Motion (SfM) and Multi-View Stereo
(MVS) achieve high precision through iterative optimization, they are limited
by complex workflows, high computational cost, and poor robustness in
challenging scenarios like texture-less regions. Recently, deep learning has
catalyzed a paradigm shift in 3D reconstruction. A new family of models,
exemplified by DUSt3R, has pioneered a feed-forward approach. These models
employ a unified deep network to jointly infer camera poses and dense geometry
directly from an Unconstrained set of images in a single forward pass. This
survey provides a systematic review of this emerging domain. We begin by
dissecting the technical framework of these feed-forward models, including
their Transformer-based correspondence modeling, joint pose and geometry
regression mechanisms, and strategies for scaling from two-view to multi-view
scenarios. To highlight the disruptive nature of this new paradigm, we contrast
it with both traditional pipelines and earlier learning-based methods like
MVSNet. Furthermore, we provide an overview of relevant datasets and evaluation
metrics. Finally, we discuss the technology's broad application prospects and
identify key future challenges and opportunities, such as model accuracy and
scalability, and handling dynamic scenes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文档识别方法忽视文档类型特定的结构特性，导致对复杂文档类型处理效果不佳。

Method: 提出设计结构特定归纳偏置的方法，并基于Transformer架构实现端到端文档识别系统。

Result: 实验证明该方法在复杂文档（如乐谱、工程图）中有效，首次实现端到端工程图转录。

Conclusion: 该方法为未来文档基础模型设计提供了统一框架，适用于非标准文档类型。

Abstract: Many document types use intrinsic, convention-driven structures that serve to
encode precise and structured information, such as the conventions governing
engineering drawings. However, state-of-the-art approaches treat document
recognition as a mere computer vision problem, neglecting these underlying
document-type-specific structural properties, making them dependent on
sub-optimal heuristic post-processing and rendering many less frequent or more
complicated document types inaccessible to modern document recognition. We
suggest a novel perspective that frames document recognition as a transcription
task from a document to a record. This implies a natural grouping of documents
based on the intrinsic structure inherent in their transcription, where related
document types can be treated (and learned) similarly. We propose a method to
design structure-specific inductive biases for the underlying machine-learned
end-to-end document recognition systems, and a respective base transformer
architecture that we successfully adapt to different structures. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of the so-found inductive biases in extensive experiments
with progressively complex record structures from monophonic sheet music, shape
drawings, and simplified engineering drawings. By integrating an inductive bias
for unrestricted graph structures, we train the first-ever successful
end-to-end model to transcribe engineering drawings to their inherently
interlinked information. Our approach is relevant to inform the design of
document recognition systems for document types that are less well understood
than standard OCR, OMR, etc., and serves as a guide to unify the design of
future document foundation models.

Conclusion: F3-Net是一种多功能、可扩展的解决方案，弥合了深度学习研究与临床实际应用之间的差距。

Abstract: F3-Net is a foundation model designed to overcome persistent challenges in
clinical medical image segmentation, including reliance on complete multimodal
inputs, limited generalizability, and narrow task specificity. Through flexible
synthetic modality training, F3-Net maintains robust performance even in the
presence of missing MRI sequences, leveraging a zero-image strategy to
substitute absent modalities without relying on explicit synthesis networks,
thereby enhancing real-world applicability. Its unified architecture supports
multi-pathology segmentation across glioma, metastasis, stroke, and white
matter lesions without retraining, outperforming CNN-based and
transformer-based models that typically require disease-specific fine-tuning.
Evaluated on diverse datasets such as BraTS 2021, BraTS 2024, and ISLES 2022,
F3-Net demonstrates strong resilience to domain shifts and clinical
heterogeneity. On the whole pathology dataset, F3-Net achieves average Dice
Similarity Coefficients (DSCs) of 0.94 for BraTS-GLI 2024, 0.82 for BraTS-MET
2024, 0.94 for BraTS 2021, and 0.79 for ISLES 2022. This positions it as a

Abstract: Document image dewarping remains a challenging task in the deep learning era.
While existing methods have improved by leveraging text line awareness, they
typically focus only on a single horizontal dimension. In this paper, we
propose a fine-grained deformation perception model that focuses on Dual
Dimensions of document horizontal-vertical-lines to improve document Dewarping
called D2Dewarp. It can perceive distortion trends in different directions
across document details. To combine the horizontal and vertical granularity
features, an effective fusion module based on X and Y coordinate is designed to
facilitate interaction and constraint between the two dimensions for feature
complementarity. Due to the lack of annotated line features in current public
dewarping datasets, we also propose an automatic fine-grained annotation method
using public document texture images and an automatic rendering engine to build
a new large-scale distortion training dataset. The code and dataset will be
publicly released. On public Chinese and English benchmarks, both quantitative
and qualitative results show that our method achieves better rectification
results compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The dataset will be
publicly available at https://github.com/xiaomore/DocDewarpHV

Conclusion: 模型和数据集将公开以推动多目标跟踪研究。

Abstract: This work presents a unified, fully differentiable model for multi-people
tracking that learns to associate detections into trajectories without relying
on pre-computed tracklets. The model builds a dynamic spatiotemporal graph that
aggregates spatial, contextual, and temporal information, enabling seamless
information propagation across entire sequences. To improve occlusion handling,
the graph can also encode scene-specific information. We also introduce a new
large-scale dataset with 25 partially overlapping views, detailed scene
reconstructions, and extensive occlusions. Experiments show the model achieves
state-of-the-art performance on public benchmarks and the new dataset, with
flexibility across diverse conditions. Both the dataset and approach will be
publicly released to advance research in multi-people tracking.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出OGFR方法，通过强化知识蒸馏解决遮挡行人重识别中的多样遮挡和特征污染问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以处理训练中未见的多样遮挡场景，且易受完整图像特征污染的影响。

Method: 采用师生蒸馏架构，设计遮挡感知视觉Transformer和特征擦除净化模块，通过强化学习识别并替换低质量补丁。

Result: OGFR能有效学习鲁棒特征表示，减少遮挡干扰。

Conclusion: OGFR通过知识蒸馏和特征净化，显著提升了遮挡行人重识别的性能。

Abstract: Occluded person re-identification aims to retrieve holistic images based on
occluded ones. Existing methods often rely on aligning visible body parts,
applying occlusion augmentation, or complementing missing semantics using
holistic images. However, they face challenges in handling diverse occlusion
scenarios not seen during training and the issue of feature contamination from
holistic images. To address these limitations, we propose Occlusion-Guided
Feature Purification Learning via Reinforced Knowledge Distillation (OGFR),
which simultaneously mitigates these challenges. OGFR adopts a teacher-student
distillation architecture that effectively incorporates diverse occlusion
patterns into feature representation while transferring the purified
discriminative holistic knowledge from the holistic to the occluded branch
through reinforced knowledge distillation. Specifically, an Occlusion-Aware
Vision Transformer is designed to leverage learnable occlusion pattern
embeddings to explicitly model such diverse occlusion types, thereby guiding
occlusion-aware robust feature representation. Moreover, we devise a Feature
Erasing and Purification Module within the holistic branch, in which an agent
is employed to identify low-quality patch tokens of holistic images that
contain noisy negative information via deep reinforcement learning, and
substitute these patch tokens with learnable embedding tokens to avoid feature
contamination and further excavate identity-related discriminative clues.
Afterward, with the assistance of knowledge distillation, the student branch
effectively absorbs the purified holistic knowledge to precisely learn robust
representation regardless of the interference of occlusions.

*Inye Na,Nejung Rue,Jiwon Chung,Hyunjin Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于3D医学图像的检索框架RadiomicsRetrieval，结合手工放射组学特征和深度学习嵌入，支持灵活查询。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学图像检索方法主要支持2D图像且需要完整标注，限制了临床灵活性。

Method: 使用可提示分割模型（如SAM）生成肿瘤特异性嵌入，通过对比学习与放射组学特征对齐，并加入解剖位置嵌入（APE）。

Result: 在肺CT和脑MRI数据集上验证，放射组学特征提高了检索特异性，APE支持基于位置的搜索。

Conclusion: 该框架仅需最小用户提示，支持灵活查询，适用于诊断、治疗规划和大规模医学图像研究。

Abstract: Medical image retrieval is a valuable field for supporting clinical
decision-making, yet current methods primarily support 2D images and require
fully annotated queries, limiting clinical flexibility. To address this, we
propose RadiomicsRetrieval, a 3D content-based retrieval framework bridging
handcrafted radiomics descriptors with deep learning-based embeddings at the
tumor level. Unlike existing 2D approaches, RadiomicsRetrieval fully exploits
volumetric data to leverage richer spatial context in medical images. We employ
a promptable segmentation model (e.g., SAM) to derive tumor-specific image
embeddings, which are aligned with radiomics features extracted from the same
tumor via contrastive learning. These representations are further enriched by
anatomical positional embedding (APE). As a result, RadiomicsRetrieval enables
flexible querying based on shape, location, or partial feature sets. Extensive
experiments on both lung CT and brain MRI public datasets demonstrate that
radiomics features significantly enhance retrieval specificity, while APE
provides global anatomical context essential for location-based searches.
Notably, our framework requires only minimal user prompts (e.g., a single
point), minimizing segmentation overhead and supporting diverse clinical
scenarios. The capability to query using either image embeddings or selected
radiomics attributes highlights its adaptability, potentially benefiting
diagnosis, treatment planning, and research on large-scale medical imaging
repositories. Our code is available at

Motivation: 现有方法使用手工规则更新SAM 2的内存，但存在局限性。提出用强化学习优化内存更新，以提升性能。

Method: 将内存控制建模为序列决策问题，使用强化学习优化SAM 2的内存更新。

Result: 在单视频代理的过拟合实验中，性能提升是现有启发式方法的三倍以上。

Conclusion: 强化学习是优化内存控制的有效替代方案，展现了内存银行的潜力。

Abstract: Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) has demonstrated strong performance in
object segmentation tasks and has become the state-of-the-art for visual object
tracking. The model stores information from previous frames in a memory bank,
enabling temporal consistency across video sequences. Recent methods augment
SAM 2 with hand-crafted update rules to better handle distractors, occlusions,
and object motion. We propose a fundamentally different approach using
reinforcement learning for optimizing memory updates in SAM 2 by framing memory
control as a sequential decision-making problem. In an overfitting setup with a
separate agent per video, our method achieves a relative improvement over SAM 2
that exceeds by more than three times the gains of existing heuristics. These
results reveal the untapped potential of the memory bank and highlight
reinforcement learning as a powerful alternative to hand-crafted update rules
for memory control in visual object tracking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有GAN方法在语义分割中无法保证语义匹配的问题，尤其是在低数据环境下。

Method: 提出DA-KPN，估计像素级转换参数，使用多尺度判别器确保转换真实性。

Result: 在语义分割的合成到真实基准测试中表现优于GAN方法，在人脸解析任务中表现相当。

Conclusion: DA-KPN在保证语义匹配的同时提升了性能，适用于低数据环境。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation relies on many dense pixel-wise annotations to achieve
the best performance, but owing to the difficulty of obtaining accurate
annotations for real world data, practitioners train on large-scale synthetic
datasets. Unpaired image translation is one method used to address the ensuing
domain gap by generating more realistic training data in low-data regimes.
Current methods for unpaired image translation train generative adversarial
networks (GANs) to perform the translation and enforce pixel-level semantic
matching through cycle consistency. These methods do not guarantee that the
semantic matching holds, posing a problem for semantic segmentation where
performance is sensitive to noisy pixel labels. We propose a novel image
translation method, Domain Adversarial Kernel Prediction Network (DA-KPN), that
guarantees semantic matching between the synthetic label and translation.
DA-KPN estimates pixel-wise input transformation parameters of a lightweight
and simple translation function. To ensure the pixel-wise transformation is
realistic, DA-KPN uses multi-scale discriminators to distinguish between
translated and target samples. We show DA-KPN outperforms previous GAN-based
methods on syn2real benchmarks for semantic segmentation with limited access to
real image labels and achieves comparable performance on face parsing.

Motivation: 现有方法以体素为基本交互单元，限制了类别级信息的利用，影响了补全结果的粒度。

Method: 提出DISC，用区分性类别查询替代体素查询，并设计专用解码模块以促进目标交互和类别级信息流。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI和SSCBench-KITTI-360基准测试中达到SOTA性能，mIoU分别为17.35和20.55。

Conclusion: DISC显著提升了实例类别性能，优于单帧和多帧SOTA方法，且仅需单帧输入。

Abstract: 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) has gained increasing attention due to its
pivotal role in 3D perception. Recent advancements have primarily focused on
refining voxel-level features to construct 3D scenes. However, treating voxels
as the basic interaction units inherently limits the utilization of class-level
information, which is proven critical for enhancing the granularity of
completion results. To address this, we propose \textbf{D}isentangling Instance
and Scene Contexts (DISC), a novel dual-stream paradigm that enhances learning
for both instance and scene categories through separated optimization.
Specifically, we replace voxel queries with discriminative class queries, which
incorporate class-specific geometric and semantic priors. Additionally, we
exploit the intrinsic properties of classes to design specialized decoding
modules, facilitating targeted interactions and efficient class-level
information flow. Experimental results demonstrate that DISC achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both SemanticKITTI and
SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks, with mIoU scores of 17.35 and 20.55,
respectively. Remarkably, DISC even outperforms multi-frame SOTA methods using
only single-frame input and significantly improves instance category
performance, surpassing both single-frame and multi-frame SOTA instance mIoU by
17.9\% and 11.9\%, respectively, on the SemanticKITTI hidden test. The code is

2.8256mm across enhancing tumor, tumor core, and whole tumor regions,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods including SCAU-Net, CA-Net, and 3D

spatial modules to boundary precision. Conclusion: Multi-modal semantic fusion
combined with bidirectional interactive attention significantly enhances brain
tumor segmentation performance, establishing new paradigms for integrating
clinical knowledge into medical image analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理时间演化分布偏移时存在缺陷（如有限内存缓存、不可靠熵置信度和静态视觉表示），需改进以适应实际场景中的渐进变化。

Method: BayesTTA通过增量估计类条件高斯混合分布、自适应选择协方差结构和校准推理（GDA），动态对齐视觉表示并监督归一化层自适。

Result: 在四个时间演化数据集和十个标准TTA数据集上，BayesTTA显著优于现有方法，保持高效性。

Conclusion: BayesTTA有效解决了CT-TTA问题，提升了模型在时间演化分布下的适应性和性能。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP achieve strong zero-shot
recognition but degrade significantly under \textit{temporally evolving
distribution shifts} common in real-world scenarios (e.g., gradual illumination
or seasonal changes). Existing continual test-time adaptation (CTTA) methods
are typically built around sudden and severe distribution shifts and neglect
temporal continuity, leading to three core defects: limited memory cache
restricts long-range distribution modeling, causing catastrophic forgetting;
entropy-based confidence becomes unreliable under temporal drift, worsening
error accumulation; and static visual representations misalign with evolving
inputs. We formalize this practical problem as \textit{Continual-Temporal
Test-Time Adaptation (CT-TTA)}, where test distributions evolve gradually over
time. To address it, we propose \textit{BayesTTA}, a Bayesian adaptation
framework that enforces temporally consistent predictions and dynamically
aligns visual representations. Specifically, BayesTTA incrementally estimates
class-conditional Gaussian mixture distributions without storing raw data,
adaptively selects covariance structures through statistical hypothesis
testing, and performs calibrated inference using Gaussian discriminant analysis
(GDA). These calibrated predictions supervise self-paced adaptation of
normalization layers, ensuring efficient and stable representation alignment.
We establish a comprehensive CT-TTA benchmark across four temporally evolving
datasets and further evaluate generalization on ten standard TTA datasets.
Extensive experiments show that BayesTTA consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant gains while maintaining
efficiency. Code is available at

Conclusion: 不同标注策略适用于不同类型的字段，需根据字段特性选择合适的标注方法。

Abstract: This study evaluates the recently proposed Document Attention Network (DAN)
for extracting key-value information from Uruguayan birth certificates,
handwritten in Spanish. We investigate two annotation strategies for
automatically transcribing handwritten documents, fine-tuning DAN with minimal
training data and annotation effort. Experiments were conducted on two datasets
containing the same images (201 scans of birth certificates written by more
than 15 different writers) but with different annotation methods. Our findings
indicate that normalized annotation is more effective for fields that can be
standardized, such as dates and places of birth, whereas diplomatic annotation
performs much better for fields containing names and surnames, which can not be
standardized.

Motivation: 现有的多帧BEV特征时序聚合方法因物体运动导致性能提升有限，需要一种更有效的时序对齐方法。

Method: 使用循环结构结合BEV特征，并引入MBFNet进行动态特征对齐，辅以时序一致性学习损失。

Result: 在nuScenes测试集上达到63.9% NDS，性能优于当前最佳方法SOLOFusion。

Conclusion: OnlineBEV在仅使用相机数据的3D物体检测任务中实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Multi-view camera-based 3D perception can be conducted using bird's eye view
(BEV) features obtained through perspective view-to-BEV transformations.
Several studies have shown that the performance of these 3D perception methods
can be further enhanced by combining sequential BEV features obtained from
multiple camera frames. However, even after compensating for the ego-motion of
an autonomous agent, the performance gain from temporal aggregation is limited
when combining a large number of image frames. This limitation arises due to
dynamic changes in BEV features over time caused by object motion. In this
paper, we introduce a novel temporal 3D perception method called OnlineBEV,
which combines BEV features over time using a recurrent structure. This
structure increases the effective number of combined features with minimal
memory usage. However, it is critical to spatially align the features over time
to maintain strong performance. OnlineBEV employs the Motion-guided BEV Fusion
Network (MBFNet) to achieve temporal feature alignment. MBFNet extracts motion
features from consecutive BEV frames and dynamically aligns historical BEV
features with current ones using these motion features. To enforce temporal
feature alignment explicitly, we use Temporal Consistency Learning Loss, which
captures discrepancies between historical and target BEV features. Experiments
conducted on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that OnlineBEV achieves
significant performance gains over the current best method, SOLOFusion.
OnlineBEV achieves 63.9% NDS on the nuScenes test set, recording
state-of-the-art performance in the camera-only 3D object detection task.

Conclusion: DatasetAgent提供了一种高效、基于真实数据的自动构建图像数据集的方法，适用于多种视觉任务。

Abstract: Common knowledge indicates that the process of constructing image datasets
usually depends on the time-intensive and inefficient method of manual
collection and annotation. Large models offer a solution via data generation.
Nonetheless, real-world data are obviously more valuable comparing to
artificially intelligence generated data, particularly in constructing image
datasets. For this reason, we propose a novel method for auto-constructing
datasets from real-world images by a multiagent collaborative system, named as
DatasetAgent. By coordinating four different agents equipped with Multi-modal
Large Language Models (MLLMs), as well as a tool package for image
optimization, DatasetAgent is able to construct high-quality image datasets
according to user-specified requirements. In particular, two types of
experiments are conducted, including expanding existing datasets and creating
new ones from scratch, on a variety of open-source datasets. In both cases,
multiple image datasets constructed by DatasetAgent are used to train various
vision models for image classification, object detection, and image
segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Transformer的模型（7T-Restormer），用于从1.5T或3T T1加权图像合成7T质量的T1图，解决了7T MRI成本高和稀缺的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 7T MRI具有更高的分辨率和对比度，但成本高且稀缺，且易产生伪影。通过合成7T质量的图像，可以降低对7T扫描仪的依赖。

Method: 使用35例1.5T和108例3T T1加权MRI与对应的7T T1图进行训练和验证，比较了7T-Restormer与ResViT和ResShift模型的性能。

Result: 7T-Restormer在1.5T和3T输入下均表现优异，PSNR和SSIM较高，且参数更少，性能优于其他模型。

Conclusion: 该方法能够高效合成7T质量的图像，为临床工作流程提供了更便捷的7T MRI替代方案。

Abstract: Purpose: Ultra-high-field 7T MRI offers improved resolution and contrast over
standard clinical field strengths (1.5T, 3T). However, 7T scanners are costly,
scarce, and introduce additional challenges such as susceptibility artifacts.
We propose an efficient transformer-based model (7T-Restormer) to synthesize
7T-quality T1-maps from routine 1.5T or 3T T1-weighted (T1W) images. Methods:
Our model was validated on 35 1.5T and 108 3T T1w MRI paired with corresponding
7T T1 maps of patients with confirmed MS. A total of 141 patient cases (32,128
slices) were randomly divided into 105 (25; 80) training cases (19,204 slices),
19 (5; 14) validation cases (3,476 slices), and 17 (5; 14) test cases (3,145
slices) where (X; Y) denotes the patients with 1.5T and 3T T1W scans,
respectively. The synthetic 7T T1 maps were compared against the ResViT and
ResShift models. Results: The 7T-Restormer model achieved a PSNR of 26.0 +/-
4.6 dB, SSIM of 0.861 +/- 0.072, and NMSE of 0.019 +/- 0.011 for 1.5T inputs,
and 25.9 +/- 4.9 dB, and 0.866 +/- 0.077 for 3T inputs, respectively. Using
10.5 M parameters, our model reduced NMSE by 64 % relative to 56.7M parameter
ResShift (0.019 vs 0.052, p = <.001 and by 41 % relative to 70.4M parameter
ResViT (0.019 vs 0.032, p = <.001) at 1.5T, with similar advantages at 3T
(0.021 vs 0.060 and 0.033; p < .001). Training with a mixed 1.5 T + 3 T corpus
was superior to single-field strategies. Restricting the model to 1.5T
increased the 1.5T NMSE from 0.019 to 0.021 (p = 1.1E-3) while training solely
on 3T resulted in lower performance on input 1.5T T1W MRI. Conclusion: We
propose a novel method for predicting quantitative 7T MP2RAGE maps from 1.5T
and 3T T1W scans with higher quality than existing state-of-the-art methods.
Our approach makes the benefits of 7T MRI more accessible to standard clinical
workflows.

Motivation: 现有MLLMs在空间推理和基础任务中表现不佳，ByDeWay旨在通过深度感知提示改进这些问题，无需修改模型参数。

Method: 使用单目深度估计将场景分为近、中、远三层，生成区域特定描述，并将其附加到图像-问题提示中，提供空间上下文。

Result: 在POPE和GQA基准测试中，ByDeWay显著减少了幻觉并提升了推理能力，适用于多种MLLMs。

Conclusion: ByDeWay通过深度感知提示在零训练设置下有效提升了MLLMs的性能，具有轻量化和模块化优势。

Abstract: We introduce ByDeWay, a training-free framework designed to enhance the
performance of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). ByDeWay uses a novel
prompting strategy called Layered-Depth-Based Prompting (LDP), which improves
spatial reasoning and grounding without modifying any model parameters. It
segments the scene into closest, mid-range, and farthest layers using monocular
depth estimation, then generates region-specific captions with a grounded
vision-language model. These structured, depth-aware captions are appended to
the image-question prompt, enriching it with spatial context. This guides MLLMs
to produce more grounded and less hallucinated responses. Our method is
lightweight, modular, and compatible with black-box MLLMs. Experiments on
hallucination-sensitive (POPE) and reasoning-intensive (GQA) benchmarks show
consistent improvements across multiple MLLMs, validating the effectiveness of
depth-aware prompting in a zero-training setting.

Result: 在BigEarthNet V2.0和Sent12MS数据集上，MoSAiC在低标签和高类重叠场景中表现优于全监督和自监督基线。

Conclusion: MoSAiC通过多模态对比学习和多标签对齐，显著提升了卫星图像表示学习的语义精确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for learning
transferable representations without the reliance on large labeled datasets.
Its ability to capture intrinsic similarities and differences among data
samples has led to state-of-the-art results in computer vision tasks. These
strengths make CL particularly well-suited for Earth System Observation (ESO),
where diverse satellite modalities such as optical and SAR imagery offer
naturally aligned views of the same geospatial regions. However, ESO presents
unique challenges, including high inter-class similarity, scene clutter, and
ambiguous boundaries, which complicate representation learning -- especially in
low-label, multi-label settings. Existing CL frameworks often focus on
intra-modality self-supervision or lack mechanisms for multi-label alignment
and semantic precision across modalities. In this work, we introduce MoSAiC, a
unified framework that jointly optimizes intra- and inter-modality contrastive
learning with a multi-label supervised contrastive loss. Designed specifically
for multi-modal satellite imagery, MoSAiC enables finer semantic
disentanglement and more robust representation learning across spectrally
similar and spatially complex classes. Experiments on two benchmark datasets,
BigEarthNet V2.0 and Sent12MS, show that MoSAiC consistently outperforms both
fully supervised and self-supervised baselines in terms of accuracy, cluster
coherence, and generalization in low-label and high-class-overlap scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于关键点跟踪的无训练分割方法，用于MRI肌肉分割，性能接近CNN模型，但计算成本更低且更易解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MRI肌肉分割方法依赖大量训练数据，计算成本高且对小肌肉分割精度不足，CNN方法泛化性和可解释性差。

Method: 结合关键点选择和Lucas-Kanade光流，提出无训练分割方法。

Result: 平均Dice相似系数0.6-0.7，性能接近CNN模型，计算需求显著降低。

Conclusion: 该方法为临床和研究提供了可扩展、鲁棒且可解释的肌肉分割方案。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) enables non-invasive, high-resolution
analysis of muscle structures. However, automated segmentation remains limited
by high computational costs, reliance on large training datasets, and reduced
accuracy in segmenting smaller muscles. Convolutional neural network
(CNN)-based methods, while powerful, often suffer from substantial
computational overhead, limited generalizability, and poor interpretability
across diverse populations. This study proposes a training-free segmentation
approach based on keypoint tracking, which integrates keypoint selection with
Lucas-Kanade optical flow. The proposed method achieves a mean Dice similarity
coefficient (DSC) ranging from 0.6 to 0.7, depending on the keypoint selection
strategy, performing comparably to state-of-the-art CNN-based models while
substantially reducing computational demands and enhancing interpretability.
This scalable framework presents a robust and explainable alternative for
muscle segmentation in clinical and research applications.

*Li Li,Yingzhe Peng,Xu Yang,Ruoxi Cheng,Haiyang Xu,Ming Yan,Fei Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于轻量级CLIP（L-CLIP）的新型嵌入式字幕评估指标L-CLIPScore，用于高效评估字幕质量和训练字幕模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有字幕评估指标效率不足，需要一种轻量且高效的替代方案。

Method: 通过权重复用和矩阵分解压缩CLIP，设计多模态相似性调节器（SR）损失进行知识蒸馏，提升多模态对齐能力。

Result: L-CLIPScore在保持与原始CLIP相当的多模态对齐能力的同时，显著减少了计算资源和运行时间。

Conclusion: L-CLIPScore作为评估指标高效有效，但训练字幕模型时需与n-gram指标混合使用以避免训练失败。

Abstract: We propose a novel embedding-based captioning metric termed as L-CLIPScore
that can be used for efficiently evaluating caption quality and training
captioning model. L-CLIPScore is calculated from a lightweight CLIP (L-CLIP),
which is a dual-encoder architecture compressed and distilled from CLIP. To
compress, we apply two powerful techniques which are weight multiplexing and
matrix decomposition for reducing the parameters of encoders and word embedding
matrix, respectively. To distill, we design a novel multi-modal Similarity
Regulator (SR) loss to transfer more vision-language alignment knowledge.
Specifically, SR loss amplifies the multi-modal embedding similarity if the
given image-text pair is matched and diminishes the similarity if the pair is
non-matched. By compressing and distilling by this novel SR loss, our L-CLIP
achieves comparable multi-modal alignment ability to the original CLIP while it
requires fewer computation resources and running time. We carry out exhaustive
experiments to validate the efficiency and effectiveness of L-CLIPScore when
using it as the judge to evaluate caption quality. We also discover that when
using L-CLIPScore as the supervisor to train the captioning model, it should be
mixed up by an n-gram-based metric and meanwhile analyze why using L-CLIPScore
only will cause fail training.

Motivation: 现有确定性注意力MIL方法缺乏对实例相关性不确定性的量化，尤其在数字病理学中，这种不确定性至关重要。

Method: 提出SGPMIL框架，利用稀疏高斯过程学习注意力分数的后验分布，并引入特征缩放以优化训练效率和性能。

Result: 在多个数字病理学数据集上，SGPMIL在袋级和实例级评估中均表现出色，提高了预测质量和效率。

Conclusion: SGPMIL不仅保持了袋级性能，还显著提升了不确定条件下的实例级预测质量，为数字病理学提供了更可靠的工具。

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) offers a natural solution for settings where
only coarse, bag-level labels are available, without having access to
instance-level annotations. This is usually the case in digital pathology,
which consists of gigapixel sized images. While deterministic attention-based
MIL approaches achieve strong bag-level performance, they often overlook the
uncertainty inherent in instance relevance. In this paper, we address the lack
of uncertainty quantification in instance-level attention scores by introducing
\textbf{SGPMIL}, a new probabilistic attention-based MIL framework grounded in
Sparse Gaussian Processes (SGP). By learning a posterior distribution over
attention scores, SGPMIL enables principled uncertainty estimation, resulting
in more reliable and calibrated instance relevance maps. Our approach not only
preserves competitive bag-level performance but also significantly improves the
quality and interpretability of instance-level predictions under uncertainty.
SGPMIL extends prior work by introducing feature scaling in the SGP predictive
mean function, leading to faster training, improved efficiency, and enhanced
instance-level performance. Extensive experiments on multiple well-established
digital pathology datasets highlight the effectiveness of our approach across
both bag- and instance-level evaluations. Our code will be made publicly
available.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公开数据集在场景复杂性、分辨率和多样性方面存在局限，无法满足实际需求，因此需要更贴近真实场景的数据集。

Method: 通过四个非重叠的高分辨率摄像头（4K，15fps）采集40分钟标记视频，包含512辆车的跨摄像头关联数据，并提供子集支持多种任务。

Result: 数据集包含丰富的挑战性场景（如遮挡和非线性运动），并提供了基线结果和评估代码。

Conclusion: RoundaboutHD为多摄像头车辆跟踪研究提供了更真实的基准，支持进一步分析和应用。

Abstract: The multi-camera vehicle tracking (MCVT) framework holds significant
potential for smart city applications, including anomaly detection, traffic
density estimation, and suspect vehicle tracking. However, current publicly
available datasets exhibit limitations, such as overly simplistic scenarios,
low-resolution footage, and insufficiently diverse conditions, creating a
considerable gap between academic research and real-world scenario. To fill
this gap, we introduce RoundaboutHD, a comprehensive, high-resolution
multi-camera vehicle tracking benchmark dataset specifically designed to
represent real-world roundabout scenarios. RoundaboutHD provides a total of 40
minutes of labelled video footage captured by four non-overlapping,
high-resolution (4K resolution, 15 fps) cameras. In total, 512 unique vehicle
identities are annotated across different camera views, offering rich
cross-camera association data. RoundaboutHD offers temporal consistency video
footage and enhanced challenges, including increased occlusions and nonlinear
movement inside the roundabout. In addition to the full MCVT dataset, several
subsets are also available for object detection, single camera tracking, and
image-based vehicle re-identification (ReID) tasks. Vehicle model information
and camera modelling/ geometry information are also included to support further
analysis. We provide baseline results for vehicle detection, single-camera
tracking, image-based vehicle re-identification, and multi-camera tracking. The

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于谱总变分（STV）特征的弱学习器集成方法，解决计算机视觉中训练数据不足的问题，并在医学影像任务中表现优于深度学习和Radiomics方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算机视觉任务中常面临训练数据不足的问题，需要一种有效的方法来提升模型性能。

Method: 使用基于STV特征的弱学习器集成方法，STV特征能有效表征多尺度纹理，且特征间相关性低。

Result: 在医学影像任务中，STV方法（AUC=0.87）优于深度学习（AUC=0.75）和Radiomics（AUC=0.79）。

Conclusion: STV特征集成方法在数据不足时表现优异，尤其是细尺度STV特征对医学影像任务具有显著预测价值。

Abstract: Solving computer vision problems through machine learning, one often
encounters lack of sufficient training data. To mitigate this we propose the
use of ensembles of weak learners based on spectral total-variation (STV)
features (Gilboa 2014). The features are related to nonlinear eigenfunctions of
the total-variation subgradient and can characterize well textures at various
scales. It was shown (Burger et-al 2016) that, in the one-dimensional case,
orthogonal features are generated, whereas in two-dimensions the features are
empirically lowly correlated. Ensemble learning theory advocates the use of
lowly correlated weak learners. We thus propose here to design ensembles using
learners based on STV features. To show the effectiveness of this paradigm we
examine a hard real-world medical imaging problem: the predictive value of
computed tomography (CT) data for high uptake in positron emission tomography
(PET) for patients suspected of skeletal metastases. The database consists of
457 scans with 1524 unique pairs of registered CT and PET slices. Our approach
is compared to deep-learning methods and to Radiomics features, showing STV
learners perform best (AUC=0.87), compared to neural nets (AUC=0.75) and
Radiomics (AUC=0.79). We observe that fine STV scales in CT images are
especially indicative for the presence of high uptake in PET.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在遥感影像分类中难以生成多粒度层次预测，且跨域迁移研究不足，限制了模型的灵活性和泛化能力。

Method: 提出HieraRS范式，结合BHCCM机制生成层次预测；设计TransLU框架（含CDKS和CDSA）支持跨域迁移；构建MM-5B数据集。

Conclusion: HieraRS和TransLU有效解决了层次分类和跨域迁移问题，MM-5B数据集为未来研究提供了资源。

Abstract: Hierarchical land cover and land use (LCLU) classification aims to assign
pixel-wise labels with multiple levels of semantic granularity to remote
sensing (RS) imagery. However, existing deep learning-based methods face two
major challenges: 1) They predominantly adopt a flat classification paradigm,
which limits their ability to generate end-to-end multi-granularity
hierarchical predictions aligned with tree-structured hierarchies used in
practice. 2) Most cross-domain studies focus on performance degradation caused
by sensor or scene variations, with limited attention to transferring LCLU
models to cross-domain tasks with heterogeneous hierarchies (e.g., LCLU to crop
classification). These limitations hinder the flexibility and generalization of
LCLU models in practical applications. To address these challenges, we propose
HieraRS, a novel hierarchical interpretation paradigm that enables
multi-granularity predictions and supports the efficient transfer of LCLU
models to cross-domain tasks with heterogeneous tree-structured hierarchies. We
introduce the Bidirectional Hierarchical Consistency Constraint Mechanism
(BHCCM), which can be seamlessly integrated into mainstream flat classification
models to generate hierarchical predictions, while improving both semantic
consistency and classification accuracy. Furthermore, we present TransLU, a
dual-branch cross-domain transfer framework comprising two key components:
Cross-Domain Knowledge Sharing (CDKS) and Cross-Domain Semantic Alignment
(CDSA). TransLU supports dynamic category expansion and facilitates the
effective adaptation of LCLU models to heterogeneous hierarchies. In addition,
we construct MM-5B, a large-scale multi-modal hierarchical land use dataset
featuring pixel-wise annotations. The code and MM-5B dataset will be released
at: https://github.com/AI-Tianlong/HieraRS.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖静态地图或昂贵传感器，限制了可扩展性和适应性，同时大规模数字孪生在隐私、通信和计算效率方面面临挑战。

Method: 提出Geo-ORBIT框架，包括轻量级车道检测模型GeoLane、个性化检测参数的Meta-GeoLane，以及联邦学习策略FedMeta-GeoLane。

Result: FedMeta-GeoLane在几何误差和泛化能力上优于基线方法，显著减少通信开销。

Conclusion: 该框架为灵活、上下文感知的基础设施建模奠定了基础。

Abstract: Digital Twins (DT) have the potential to transform traffic management and
operations by creating dynamic, virtual representations of transportation
systems that sense conditions, analyze operations, and support decision-making.
A key component for DT of the transportation system is dynamic roadway geometry
sensing. However, existing approaches often rely on static maps or costly
sensors, limiting scalability and adaptability. Additionally, large-scale DTs
that collect and analyze data from multiple sources face challenges in privacy,
communication, and computational efficiency. To address these challenges, we
introduce Geo-ORBIT (Geometrical Operational Roadway Blueprint with Integrated
Twin), a unified framework that combines real-time lane detection, DT
synchronization, and federated meta-learning. At the core of Geo-ORBIT is
GeoLane, a lightweight lane detection model that learns lane geometries from
vehicle trajectory data using roadside cameras. We extend this model through
Meta-GeoLane, which learns to personalize detection parameters for local
entities, and FedMeta-GeoLane, a federated learning strategy that ensures
scalable and privacy-preserving adaptation across roadside deployments. Our
system is integrated with CARLA and SUMO to create a high-fidelity DT that
renders highway scenarios and captures traffic flows in real-time. Extensive
experiments across diverse urban scenes show that FedMeta-GeoLane consistently
outperforms baseline and meta-learning approaches, achieving lower geometric
error and stronger generalization to unseen locations while drastically
reducing communication overhead. This work lays the foundation for flexible,
context-aware infrastructure modeling in DTs. The framework is publicly
available at https://github.com/raynbowy23/FedMeta-GeoLane.git.

Motivation: 由于SAM及其变体在零样本分割中的优异表现，压缩这些模型成为迫切需求。

Method: 提出Hyper-Compression算法，将高维参数向量转为低维标量，并设计HyperLinear加速推理。

Result: 在18个SAM模型上测试，压缩比为5.17x，性能下降小于1%，压缩时间少于60秒。

Conclusion: Birkhoff在压缩效率、性能和速度上表现优异，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Due to the excellent performance in yielding high-quality, zero-shot
segmentation, Segment Anything Model (SAM) and its variants have been widely
applied in diverse scenarios such as healthcare and intelligent manufacturing.
Therefore, effectively compressing SAMs has become an increasingly pressing
practical need. In this study, we propose Birkhoff, a novel data-free
compression algorithm for SAM and its variants. Unlike quantization, pruning,
distillation, and other compression methods, Birkhoff embodies versatility
across model types, agility in deployment, faithfulness to the original model,
and compactness in model size. Specifically, Birkhoff introduces a novel
compression algorithm: Hyper-Compression, whose core principle is to find a
dense trajectory to turn a high-dimensional parameter vector into a
low-dimensional scalar. Furthermore, Birkhoff designs a dedicated linear layer
operator, HyperLinear, to fuse decompression and matrix multiplication to
significantly accelerate inference of the compressed SAMs. Extensive
experiments on 18 SAMs in the COCO, LVIS, and SA-1B datasets show that Birkhoff
performs consistently and competitively in compression time, compression ratio,
post-compression performance, and inference speed. For example, Birkhoff can
achieve a compression ratio of 5.17x on SAM2-B, with less than 1% performance
drop without using any fine-tuning data. Moreover, the compression is finished
within 60 seconds for all models.

Abstract: We introduce NeuralOS, a neural framework that simulates graphical user

NeuralOS combines a recurrent neural network (RNN), which tracks computer
state, with a diffusion-based neural renderer that generates screen images. The
model is trained on a large-scale dataset of Ubuntu XFCE recordings, which
include both randomly generated interactions and realistic interactions
produced by AI agents. Experiments show that NeuralOS successfully renders
realistic GUI sequences, accurately captures mouse interactions, and reliably
predicts state transitions like application launches. Although modeling
fine-grained keyboard interactions precisely remains challenging, NeuralOS
offers a step toward creating fully adaptive, generative neural interfaces for
future human-computer interaction systems.

Abstract: This study presents a hybrid model for classifying handwritten digits in the
MNIST dataset, combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with a multi-well
Hopfield network. The approach employs a CNN to extract high-dimensional
features from input images, which are then clustered into class-specific
prototypes using k-means clustering. These prototypes serve as attractors in a
multi-well energy landscape, where a Hopfield network performs classification
by minimizing an energy function that balances feature similarity and class
assignment.The model's design enables robust handling of intraclass
variability, such as diverse handwriting styles, while providing an
interpretable framework through its energy-based decision process. Through
systematic optimization of the CNN architecture and the number of wells, the
model achieves a high test accuracy of 99.2% on 10,000 MNIST images,
demonstrating its effectiveness for image classification tasks. The findings
highlight the critical role of deep feature extraction and sufficient prototype
coverage in achieving high performance, with potential for broader applications

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D generation have transitioned from multi-view 2D
rendering approaches to 3D-native latent diffusion frameworks that exploit
geometric priors in ground truth data. Despite progress, three key limitations
persist: (1) Single-latent representations fail to capture complex multi-part
geometries, causing detail degradation; (2) Holistic latent coding neglects
part independence and interrelationships critical for compositional design; (3)
Global conditioning mechanisms lack fine-grained controllability. Inspired by
human 3D design workflows, we propose CoPart - a part-aware diffusion framework
that decomposes 3D objects into contextual part latents for coherent multi-part
generation. This paradigm offers three advantages: i) Reduces encoding
complexity through part decomposition; ii) Enables explicit part relationship
modeling; iii) Supports part-level conditioning. We further develop a mutual
guidance strategy to fine-tune pre-trained diffusion models for joint part
latent denoising, ensuring both geometric coherence and foundation model
priors. To enable large-scale training, we construct Partverse - a novel 3D
part dataset derived from Objaverse through automated mesh segmentation and
human-verified annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate CoPart's superior
capabilities in part-level editing, articulated object generation, and scene
composition with unprecedented controllability.

Conclusion: CLiFT在数据大小、渲染质量和速度之间提供了灵活权衡，是一种高效的神经渲染方法。

Abstract: This paper proposes a neural rendering approach that represents a scene as
"compressed light-field tokens (CLiFTs)", retaining rich appearance and
geometric information of a scene. CLiFT enables compute-efficient rendering by
compressed tokens, while being capable of changing the number of tokens to
represent a scene or render a novel view with one trained network. Concretely,
given a set of images, multi-view encoder tokenizes the images with the camera
poses. Latent-space K-means selects a reduced set of rays as cluster centroids
using the tokens. The multi-view ``condenser'' compresses the information of
all the tokens into the centroid tokens to construct CLiFTs. At test time,
given a target view and a compute budget (i.e., the number of CLiFTs), the
system collects the specified number of nearby tokens and synthesizes a novel
view using a compute-adaptive renderer. Extensive experiments on RealEstate10K
and DL3DV datasets quantitatively and qualitatively validate our approach,
achieving significant data reduction with comparable rendering quality and the
highest overall rendering score, while providing trade-offs of data size,
rendering quality, and rendering speed.

Motivation: 医疗数据标注的劳动密集性导致高质量标注数据集稀缺，且患者隐私问题限制了数据共享，现有方法常牺牲隐私。

Method: 采用元随机梯度下降算法减少过拟合，并引入高斯差分隐私噪声保护梯度；使用加权平均算法聚合本地模型。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在保护隐私的同时，能有效诊断不同结构、类别和分布的呼吸疾病数据。

Conclusion: 该框架在数据有限和隐私保护需求下，为呼吸疾病诊断提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: The labor-intensive nature of medical data annotation presents a significant
challenge for respiratory disease diagnosis, resulting in a scarcity of
high-quality labeled datasets in resource-constrained settings. Moreover,
patient privacy concerns complicate the direct sharing of local medical data
across institutions, and existing centralized data-driven approaches, which
rely on amounts of available data, often compromise data privacy. This study
proposes a federated few-shot learning framework with privacy-preserving
mechanisms to address the issues of limited labeled data and privacy protection
in diagnosing respiratory diseases. In particular, a meta-stochastic gradient
descent algorithm is proposed to mitigate the overfitting problem that arises
from insufficient data when employing traditional gradient descent methods for
neural network training. Furthermore, to ensure data privacy against gradient
leakage, differential privacy noise from a standard Gaussian distribution is
integrated into the gradients during the training of private models with local
data, thereby preventing the reconstruction of medical images. Given the
impracticality of centralizing respiratory disease data dispersed across
various medical institutions, a weighted average algorithm is employed to
aggregate local diagnostic models from different clients, enhancing the
adaptability of a model across diverse scenarios. Experimental results show
that the proposed method yields compelling results with the implementation of
differential privacy, while effectively diagnosing respiratory diseases using
data from different structures, categories, and distributions.

*Kenshin Abe,Yunzhuo Wang,Shuhei Watanabe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的树结构Parzen估计器（TPE）算法，用于高效处理组合优化问题，特别是在化学和生物学领域的黑盒组合优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管TPE在深度学习领域的超参数优化（HPO）中表现优异，但其在组合优化问题中的应用尚未充分探索，而组合优化在化学和生物学等领域具有重要意义。

Method: 作者首先将TPE中的分类核与数值核进行泛化，为分类核引入距离结构，并讨论了针对大规模组合搜索空间的核修改方法，以降低计算复杂度。

Result: 实验表明，改进后的算法在合成问题上比原始TPE能以更少的评估次数找到更好的解。

Conclusion: 该算法已集成到开源HPO框架Optuna中，为组合优化问题提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Tree-structured Parzen estimator (TPE) is a versatile hyperparameter
optimization (HPO) method supported by popular HPO tools. Since these HPO tools
have been developed in line with the trend of deep learning (DL), the problem
setups often used in the DL domain have been discussed for TPE such as
multi-objective optimization and multi-fidelity optimization. However, the
practical applications of HPO are not limited to DL, and black-box
combinatorial optimization is actively utilized in some domains, e.g.,
chemistry and biology. As combinatorial optimization has been an untouched, yet
very important, topic in TPE, we propose an efficient combinatorial
optimization algorithm for TPE. In this paper, we first generalize the
categorical kernel with the numerical kernel in TPE, enabling us to introduce a
distance structure to the categorical kernel. Then we discuss modifications for
the newly developed kernel to handle a large combinatorial search space. These
modifications reduce the time complexity of the kernel calculation with respect
to the size of a combinatorial search space. In the experiments using synthetic
problems, we verified that our proposed method identifies better solutions with
fewer evaluations than the original TPE. Our algorithm is available in Optuna,
an open-source framework for HPO.

*Simon Matrenok,Skander Moalla,Caglar Gulcehre*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: QRPO是一种新方法，能够从点式绝对奖励中学习，同时保持DPO类方法的简单性和离线适用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法（如PPO和GRPO）需要在线策略学习，而简单方法（如DPO和REBEL）只能从偏好对或相对信号中学习的局限性。

Method: QRPO利用分位数奖励，实现KL正则化强化学习目标的闭式解回归，无需相对信号来抵消分区函数。

Result: QRPO在聊天和编码评估中表现优于DPO、REBEL和SimPO，并在8B规模模型上验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: QRPO通过直接使用鲁棒奖励而非偏好转换，减少了长度偏差，并展示了预计算扩展的新维度。

Abstract: Aligning large language models with pointwise absolute rewards has so far
required online, on-policy algorithms such as PPO and GRPO. In contrast,
simpler methods that can leverage offline or off-policy data, such as DPO and
REBEL, are limited to learning from preference pairs or relative signals. To
bridge this gap, we introduce \emph{Quantile Reward Policy Optimization}
(QRPO), which learns from pointwise absolute rewards while preserving the
simplicity and offline applicability of DPO-like methods. QRPO uses quantile
rewards to enable regression to the closed-form solution of the KL-regularized
RL objective. This reward yields an analytically tractable partition function,
removing the need for relative signals to cancel this term. Moreover, QRPO
scales with increased compute to estimate quantile rewards, opening a new
dimension for pre-computation scaling. Empirically, QRPO consistently achieves
top performance on chat and coding evaluations -- reward model scores,
AlpacaEval 2, and LeetCode -- compared to DPO, REBEL, and SimPO across diverse
datasets and 8B-scale models. Finally, we find that training with robust
rewards instead of converting them to preferences induces less length bias.

TL;DR: MoFaSGD是一种内存高效的大模型微调方法，通过动态低秩SVD近似动量，减少GPU内存需求，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大模型微调中因AdamW等状态优化器导致的高内存消耗问题。

Method: 提出MoFaSGD，动态更新低秩SVD表示动量，支持高效谱归一化更新。

Result: 在语言模型对齐任务中，MoFaSGD在内存减少和性能之间取得平衡。

Conclusion: MoFaSGD是一种高效且理论保证的低秩优化方法，适用于大模型微调。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large foundation models presents significant memory challenges
due to stateful optimizers like AdamW, often requiring several times more GPU
memory than inference. While memory-efficient methods like parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (e.g., LoRA) and optimizer state compression exist, recent
approaches like GaLore bridge these by using low-rank gradient projections and
subspace moment accumulation. However, such methods may struggle with fixed
subspaces or computationally costly offline resampling (e.g., requiring
full-matrix SVDs). We propose Momentum Factorized SGD (MoFaSGD), which
maintains a dynamically updated low-rank SVD representation of the first-order
momentum, closely approximating its full-rank counterpart throughout training.
This factorization enables a memory-efficient fine-tuning method that
adaptively updates the optimization subspace at each iteration. Crucially,
MoFaSGD leverages the computed low-rank momentum factors to perform efficient
spectrally normalized updates, offering an alternative to subspace moment
accumulation. We establish theoretical convergence guarantees for MoFaSGD,
proving it achieves an optimal rate for non-convex stochastic optimization
under standard assumptions. Empirically, we demonstrate MoFaSGD's effectiveness
on large language model alignment benchmarks, achieving a competitive trade-off
between memory reduction (comparable to LoRA) and performance compared to
state-of-the-art low-rank optimization methods. Our implementation is available
at https://github.com/pmahdavi/MoFaSGD.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于PDE残差梯度方差的优化器，用于改进PINNs训练中的梯度对齐问题，相比Adam和SOAP表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准优化器（如Adam）在处理PINNs中的竞争损失项时表现不佳，尤其是在刚性或病态系统中。

Method: 提出了一种PDE感知优化器，根据PDE残差梯度的方差自适应调整参数更新。

Result: 在1D Burgers'、Allen-Cahn和KdV方程上测试，PDE感知优化器收敛更平滑，绝对误差更低。

Conclusion: PDE残差感知的自适应方法能有效提升PINNs训练的稳定性，但需进一步研究在大规模架构和硬件加速器上的扩展性。

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful framework
for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by embedding physical
constraints into the loss function. However, standard optimizers such as Adam
often struggle to balance competing loss terms, particularly in stiff or
ill-conditioned systems. In this work, we propose a PDE-aware optimizer that
adapts parameter updates based on the variance of per-sample PDE residual
gradients. This method addresses gradient misalignment without incurring the
heavy computational costs of second-order optimizers such as SOAP. We benchmark
the PDE-aware optimizer against Adam and SOAP on 1D Burgers', Allen-Cahn and
Korteweg-de Vries(KdV) equations. Across both PDEs, the PDE-aware optimizer
achieves smoother convergence and lower absolute errors, particularly in
regions with sharp gradients. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of PDE
residual-aware adaptivity in enhancing stability in PINNs training. While
promising, further scaling on larger architectures and hardware accelerators
remains an important direction for future research.

Result: QRPINNs在理论和实验上均优于传统PINNs和自适应采样方法，高维PDE中表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: QRPINNs显著提升了PINNs的性能，结合自适应采样可进一步优化。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks have shown promise in solving partial
differential equations (PDEs) by integrating physical constraints into neural
network training, but their performance is sensitive to the sampling of points.
Based on the impressive performance of quasi Monte-Carlo methods in high
dimensional problems, this paper proposes Quasi-Random Physics-Informed Neural
Networks (QRPINNs), which use low-discrepancy sequences for sampling instead of
random points directly from the domain. Theoretically, QRPINNs have been proven
to have a better convergence rate than PINNs. Empirically, experiments
demonstrate that QRPINNs significantly outperform PINNs and some representative
adaptive sampling methods, especially in high-dimensional PDEs. Furthermore,
combining QRPINNs with adaptive sampling can further improve the performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PINN无法严格满足约束条件，这在工程系统中可能导致预测结果不可靠。

Method: 利用KKT条件进行可行域投影，并通过对数-指数变换重构非线性KKT条件，使其可微分。

Result: 在测试问题和实际化学过程模拟中，KKT-Hardnet比传统PINN和多层感知机具有更高的准确性和严格的约束满足。

Conclusion: KKT-Hardnet为复杂系统的可靠混合建模提供了一种新方法。

Abstract: Traditional physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) do not guarantee strict
constraint satisfaction. This is problematic in engineering systems where minor
violations of governing laws can significantly degrade the reliability and
consistency of model predictions. In this work, we develop KKT-Hardnet, a PINN
architecture that enforces both linear and nonlinear equality and inequality
constraints up to machine precision. It leverages a projection onto the
feasible region through solving Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of a
distance minimization problem. Furthermore, we reformulate the nonlinear KKT
conditions using log-exponential transformation to construct a general sparse
system with only linear and exponential terms, thereby making the projection
differentiable. We apply KKT-Hardnet on both test problems and a real-world
chemical process simulation. Compared to multilayer perceptrons and PINNs,
KKT-Hardnet achieves higher accuracy and strict constraint satisfaction. This
approach allows the integration of domain knowledge into machine learning
towards reliable hybrid modeling of complex systems.

Conclusion: ALCo-FM在大规模城市风险预测中表现优异，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Traffic accidents are rare, yet high-impact events that require long-context
multimodal reasoning for accurate risk forecasting. In this paper, we introduce
ALCo-FM, a unified adaptive long-context foundation model that computes a
volatility pre-score to dynamically select context windows for input data and
encodes and fuses these multimodal data via shallow cross attention. Following
a local GAT layer and a BigBird-style sparse global transformer over H3
hexagonal grids, coupled with Monte Carlo dropout for confidence, the model
yields superior, well-calibrated predictions. Trained on data from 15 US cities
with a class-weighted loss to counter label imbalance, and fine-tuned with
minimal data on held-out cities, ALCo-FM achieves 0.94 accuracy, 0.92 F1, and
an ECE of 0.04, outperforming more than 20 state-of-the-art baselines in

Abstract: Machine learning has been proposed as a way to improve educational assessment
by making fine-grained predictions about student performance and learning
relationships between items. One challenge with many machine learning
approaches is incorporating new items, as these approaches rely heavily on
historical data. We develop Text-LENS by extending the LENS partial variational
auto-encoder for educational assessment to leverage item text embeddings, and
explore the impact on predictive performance and generalization to previously
unseen items. We examine performance on two datasets: Eedi, a publicly
available dataset that includes item content, and LLM-Sim, a novel dataset with
test items produced by an LLM. We find that Text-LENS matches LENS' performance
on seen items and improves upon it in a variety of conditions involving unseen
items; it effectively learns student proficiency from and makes predictions
about student performance on new items.

Conclusion: 量子机器学习结合可穿戴传感器数据，为临床和辅助生活场景提供无干扰情绪监测基础。

Abstract: We investigate the feasibility of inferring emotional states exclusively from
physiological signals, thereby presenting a privacy-preserving alternative to
conventional facial recognition techniques. We conduct a performance comparison
of classical machine learning algorithms and hybrid quantum machine learning
(QML) methods with a quantum kernel-based model. Our results indicate that the
quantum-enhanced SVM surpasses classical counterparts in classification
performance across all emotion categories, even when trained on limited
datasets. The F1 scores over all classes are over 80% with around a maximum of
36% improvement in the recall values. The integration of wearable sensor data
with quantum machine learning not only enhances accuracy and robustness but
also facilitates unobtrusive emotion recognition. This methodology holds
promise for populations with impaired communication abilities, such as
individuals with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) and veterans
with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The findings establish an early
foundation for passive emotional monitoring in clinical and assisted living
conditions.

Conclusion: 论文旨在推动可扩展、自适应、可解释且空间基础的异常检测系统研究，促进因果驱动方法应对互联基础设施中的威胁。

Abstract: As cyber-physical systems grow increasingly interconnected and spatially
distributed, ensuring their resilience against evolving cyberattacks has become
a critical priority. Spatio-Temporal Anomaly detection plays an important role
in ensuring system security and operational integrity. However, current
data-driven approaches, largely driven by black-box deep learning, face
challenges in interpretability, adaptability to distribution shifts, and
robustness under evolving system dynamics. In this paper, we advocate for a
causal learning perspective to advance anomaly detection in spatially
distributed infrastructures that grounds detection in structural cause-effect
relationships. We identify and formalize three key directions: causal graph
profiling, multi-view fusion, and continual causal graph learning, each
offering distinct advantages in uncovering dynamic cause-effect structures
across time and space. Drawing on real-world insights from systems such as
water treatment infrastructures, we illustrate how causal models provide early
warning signals and root cause attribution, addressing the limitations of
black-box detectors. Looking ahead, we outline the future research agenda
centered on multi-modality, generative AI-driven, and scalable adaptive causal
frameworks. Our objective is to lay a new research trajectory toward scalable,
adaptive, explainable, and spatially grounded anomaly detection systems. We
hope to inspire a paradigm shift in cybersecurity research, promoting
causality-driven approaches to address evolving threats in interconnected
infrastructures.

Conclusion: CTRLS通过结构化建模和强化学习，显著提升了链式思维推理的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning enables large language models (LLMs) to
break down complex problems into interpretable intermediate steps,
significantly enhancing model transparency and performance in reasoning tasks.
However, conventional CoT methods rely on heuristic sampling without structured
modeling of reasoning transitions, constraining their ability to systematically
explore and discover diverse and effective reasoning trajectories. In this
work, we introduce CTRLS, a framework that formulates CoT reasoning as a Markov
decision process (MDP) with latent state transitions, enabling principled and
state-aware exploration via distributional reinforcement learning. By modelling
reasoning actions as explicit probability distributions in latent space, our
approach explicitly models epistemic uncertainty, facilitating robust
exploration of the reasoning space. As part of our framework, we introduce an
on-policy reinforcement learning strategy incorporating epsilon-greedy
exploration and entropy-based regularization to iteratively refine latent state
transitions without requiring additional fine-tuning of the underlying LLM.
Theoretical analyses provide evidence lower bounds (ELBO), theoretically
grounding our transition-aware modeling of latent reasoning dynamics. Further
experiments demonstrate improvements in reasoning accuracy, diversity, and
exploration efficiency across benchmark reasoning tasks.

Motivation: 现有攻击方法依赖梯度信息，限制了其在非可微目标上的适应性，且优化结果远离最优。

Result: EvA攻击在实验中平均比现有最佳攻击方法多降低11%的准确率。

Conclusion: EvA揭示了攻击设计中的未开发潜力，适用于更广泛的场景。

Abstract: Even a slight perturbation in the graph structure can cause a significant
drop in the accuracy of graph neural networks (GNNs). Most existing attacks
leverage gradient information to perturb edges. This relaxes the attack's
optimization problem from a discrete to a continuous space, resulting in
solutions far from optimal. It also restricts the adaptability of the attack to
non-differentiable objectives. Instead, we introduce a few simple yet effective
enhancements of an evolutionary-based algorithm to solve the discrete
optimization problem directly. Our Evolutionary Attack (EvA) works with any
black-box model and objective, eliminating the need for a differentiable proxy
loss. This allows us to design two novel attacks that reduce the effectiveness
of robustness certificates and break conformal sets. The memory complexity of
our attack is linear in the attack budget. Among our experiments, EvA shows
$\sim$11\% additional drop in accuracy on average compared to the best previous
attack, revealing significant untapped potential in designing attacks.

Conclusion: SPLASH填补了逆强化学习在实际应用中的关键空白，尤其在长时域和对抗性任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) presents a powerful paradigm for
learning complex robotic tasks from human demonstrations. However, most
approaches make the assumption that expert demonstrations are available, which
is often not the case. Those that allow for suboptimality in the demonstrations
are not designed for long-horizon goals or adversarial tasks. Many desirable
robot capabilities fall into one or both of these categories, thus highlighting
a critical shortcoming in the ability of IRL to produce field-ready robotic
agents. We introduce Sample-efficient Preference-based inverse reinforcement
learning for Long-horizon Adversarial tasks from Suboptimal Hierarchical
demonstrations (SPLASH), which advances the state-of-the-art in learning from
suboptimal demonstrations to long-horizon and adversarial settings. We
empirically validate SPLASH on a maritime capture-the-flag task in simulation,
and demonstrate real-world applicability with sim-to-real translation
experiments on autonomous unmanned surface vehicles. We show that our proposed
methods allow SPLASH to significantly outperform the state-of-the-art in reward
learning from suboptimal demonstrations.

Abstract: Smart buildings generate vast streams of sensor and control data, but
facility managers often lack clear explanations for anomalous energy usage. We
propose InsightBuild, a two-stage framework that integrates causality analysis
with a fine-tuned large language model (LLM) to provide human-readable, causal
explanations of energy consumption patterns. First, a lightweight causal
inference module applies Granger causality tests and structural causal
discovery on building telemetry (e.g., temperature, HVAC settings, occupancy)
drawn from Google Smart Buildings and Berkeley Office datasets. Next, an LLM,
fine-tuned on aligned pairs of sensor-level causes and textual explanations,
receives as input the detected causal relations and generates concise,
actionable explanations. We evaluate InsightBuild on two real-world datasets
(Google: 2017-2022; Berkeley: 2018-2020), using expert-annotated ground-truth
causes for a held-out set of anomalies. Our results demonstrate that combining
explicit causal discovery with LLM-based natural language generation yields
clear, precise explanations that assist facility managers in diagnosing and
mitigating energy inefficiencies.

Abstract: Human state detection and behavior prediction have seen significant
advancements with the rise of machine learning and multimodal sensing
technologies. However, predicting prosocial behavior intentions in mobility
scenarios, such as helping others on the road, is an underexplored area.
Current research faces a major limitation. There are no large, labeled datasets
available for prosocial behavior, and small-scale datasets make it difficult to
train deep-learning models effectively. To overcome this, we propose a
self-supervised learning approach that harnesses multi-modal data from existing
physiological and behavioral datasets. By pre-training our model on diverse
tasks and fine-tuning it with a smaller, manually labeled prosocial behavior
dataset, we significantly enhance its performance. This method addresses the
data scarcity issue, providing a more effective benchmark for prosocial
behavior prediction, and offering valuable insights for improving intelligent

Abstract: Estimating the score function (or other population-density-dependent
functions) is a fundamental component of most generative models. However, such
function estimation is computationally and statistically challenging. Can we
avoid function estimation for data generation? We propose an estimation-free
generative method: A set of points whose locations are deterministically
updated with (inverse) gradient descent can transport a uniform distribution to
arbitrary data distribution, in the mean field regime, without function
estimation, training neural networks, and even noise injection. The proposed
method is built upon recent advances in the physics of interacting particles.
We show, both theoretically and experimentally, that these advances can be
leveraged to develop novel generative methods.

Abstract: Density and geometry have long served as two of the fundamental guiding
principles in clustering algorithm design, with algorithm usually focusing
either on the density structure of the data (e.g., HDBSCAN and Density Peak
Clustering) or the complexity of underlying geometry (e.g., manifold clustering
algorithms).
  In this paper, we identify and formalize a recurring but often overlooked
interaction between distribution and geometry and leverage this insight to
design our clustering enhancement framework CoreSPECT (Core Space
Projection-based Enhancement of Clustering Techniques). Our framework boosts
the performance of simple algorithms like K-Means and GMM by applying them to
strategically selected regions, then extending the partial partition to a
complete partition for the dataset using a novel neighborhood graph based
multi-layer propagation procedure.
  We apply our framework on 15 datasets from three different domains and obtain
consistent and substantial gain in clustering accuracy for both K-Means and
GMM. On average, our framework improves the ARI of K-Means by 40% and of GMM by
14%, often surpassing the performance of both manifold-based and recent
density-based clustering algorithms. We further support our framework with
initial theoretical guarantees, ablation to demonstrate the usefulness of the
individual steps and with evidence of robustness to noise.

Abstract: Missing data presents a critical challenge in real-world datasets,
significantly degrading the performance of machine learning models. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
tabular data imputation, exemplified by frameworks like UnIMP, their reliance
on classical embedding methods often limits their ability to capture complex,
non-linear correlations, particularly in mixed-type data scenarios encompassing
numerical, categorical, and textual features. This paper introduces
Quantum-UnIMP, a novel framework that integrates shallow quantum circuits into
an LLM-based imputation architecture. Our core innovation lies in replacing
conventional classical input embeddings with quantum feature maps generated by
an Instantaneous Quantum Polynomial (IQP) circuit. This approach enables the
model to leverage quantum phenomena such as superposition and entanglement,
thereby learning richer, more expressive representations of data and enhancing
the recovery of intricate missingness patterns. Our experiments on benchmark
mixed-type datasets demonstrate that Quantum-UnIMP reduces imputation error by
up to 15.2% for numerical features (RMSE) and improves classification accuracy
by 8.7% for categorical features (F1-Score) compared to state-of-the-art
classical and LLM-based methods. These compelling results underscore the
profound potential of quantum-enhanced representations for complex data
imputation tasks, even with near-term quantum hardware.

Conclusion: 该方法在严格无泄漏的AI数学奥林匹克竞赛中表现优异，为开发高效准确的数学推理模型提供了实用方案。

Abstract: Enhancing the mathematical reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a
pivotal challenge in advancing AI capabilities. While Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) are the dominant training paradigms, a
systematic methodology for combining them to maximize both accuracy and
efficiency remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces a practical and
effective training recipe that strategically integrates extended SFT with RL
from online inference (GRPO). We posit that these methods play complementary,
not competing, roles: a prolonged SFT phase first pushes the model's accuracy
to its limits, after which a GRPO phase dramatically improves token efficiency
while preserving this peak performance. Our experiments reveal that extending
SFT for as many as 10 epochs is crucial for performance breakthroughs, and that
the primary role of GRPO in this framework is to optimize solution length. The
efficacy of our recipe is rigorously validated through top-tier performance on
challenging benchmarks, including a high rank among over 2,200 teams in the
strictly leak-free AI Mathematical Olympiad (AIMO). This work provides the
community with a battle-tested blueprint for developing state-of-the-art
mathematical reasoners that are both exceptionally accurate and practically
efficient. To ensure full reproducibility and empower future research, we will

Abstract: Dimensional synthesis of planar four-bar mechanisms is a challenging inverse
problem in kinematics, requiring the determination of mechanism dimensions from
desired motion specifications. We propose a data-driven framework that bypasses
traditional equation-solving and optimization by leveraging supervised
learning. Our method combines a synthetic dataset, an LSTM-based neural network
for handling sequential precision points, and a Mixture of Experts (MoE)
architecture tailored to different linkage types. Each expert model is trained
on type-specific data and guided by a type-specifying layer, enabling both
single-type and multi-type synthesis. A novel simulation metric evaluates
prediction quality by comparing desired and generated motions. Experiments show
our approach produces accurate, defect-free linkages across various
configurations. This enables intuitive and efficient mechanism design, even for
non-expert users, and opens new possibilities for scalable and flexible
synthesis in kinematic design.

Abstract: We introduce a lightweight yet highly effective safety guardrail framework
for language models, demonstrating that small-scale language models can
achieve, and even surpass, the performance of larger counterparts in content
moderation tasks. This is accomplished through high-fidelity synthetic data
generation and adversarial training. The synthetic data generation process
begins with human-curated seed data, which undergoes query augmentation and
paraphrasing to create diverse and contextually rich examples. This augmented
data is then subjected to multiple rounds of curation, ensuring high fidelity
and relevance. Inspired by recent advances in the Generative Adversarial
Network (GAN) architecture, our adversarial training employs reinforcement
learning to guide a generator that produces challenging synthetic examples.
These examples are used to fine-tune the safety classifier, enhancing its
ability to detect and mitigate harmful content. Additionally, we incorporate
strategies from recent research on efficient LLM training, leveraging the
capabilities of smaller models to improve the performance of larger generative
models. With iterative adversarial training and the generation of diverse,
high-quality synthetic data, our framework enables small language models (SLMs)
to serve as robust safety guardrails. This approach not only reduces
computational overhead but also enhances resilience against adversarial
attacks, offering a scalable and efficient solution for content moderation in
AI systems.

Abstract: Accurate workload prediction and advanced resource reservation are
indispensably crucial for managing dynamic cloud services. Traditional neural
networks and deep learning models frequently encounter challenges with diverse,
high-dimensional workloads, especially during sudden resource demand changes,
leading to inefficiencies. This issue arises from their limited optimization
during training, relying only on parametric (inter-connection weights)
adjustments using conventional algorithms. To address this issue, this work
proposes a novel Comprehensively Adaptive Architectural Optimization-based
Variable Quantum Neural Network (CA-QNN), which combines the efficiency of
quantum computing with complete structural and qubit vector parametric
learning. The model converts workload data into qubits, processed through qubit
neurons with Controlled NOT-gated activation functions for intuitive pattern
recognition. In addition, a comprehensive architecture optimization algorithm
for networks is introduced to facilitate the learning and propagation of the
structure and parametric values in variable-sized QNNs. This algorithm
incorporates quantum adaptive modulation and size-adaptive recombination during
training process. The performance of CA-QNN model is thoroughly investigated
against seven state-of-the-art methods across four benchmark datasets of
heterogeneous cloud workloads. The proposed model demonstrates superior
prediction accuracy, reducing prediction errors by up to 93.40% and 91.27%
compared to existing deep learning and QNN-based approaches.

Conclusion: scE2TM为单细胞RNA-seq数据分析提供了更全面的工具，揭示了更多生物学机制。

Abstract: Recent advances in sequencing technologies have enabled researchers to
explore cellular heterogeneity at single-cell resolution. Meanwhile,
interpretability has gained prominence parallel to the rapid increase in the
complexity and performance of deep learning models. In recent years, topic
models have been widely used for interpretable single-cell embedding learning
and clustering analysis, which we refer to as single-cell embedded topic
models. However, previous studies evaluated the interpretability of the models
mainly through qualitative analysis, and these single-cell embedded topic
models suffer from the potential problem of interpretation collapse.
Furthermore, their neglect of external biological knowledge constrains
analytical performance. Here, we present scE2TM, an external knowledge-guided
single-cell embedded topic model that provides a high-quality cell embedding
and strong interpretation, contributing to comprehensive scRNA-seq data
analysis. Our comprehensive evaluation across 20 scRNA-seq datasets
demonstrates that scE2TM achieves significant clustering performance gains
compared to 7 state-of-the-art methods. In addition, we propose a new
interpretability evaluation benchmark that introduces 10 metrics to
quantitatively assess the interpretability of single-cell embedded topic
models. The results show that the interpretation provided by scE2TM performs
encouragingly in terms of diversity and consistency with the underlying
biological signals, contributing to a better revealing of the underlying
biological mechanisms.

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过改进数据集和模型训练，显著提升了从文本中提取BPMN模型的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Efficient planning, resource management, and consistent operations often rely
on converting textual process documents into formal Business Process Model and
Notation (BPMN) models. However, this conversion process remains time-intensive
and costly. Existing approaches, whether rule-based or machine-learning-based,
still struggle with writing styles and often fail to identify parallel
structures in process descriptions.
  This paper introduces an automated pipeline for extracting BPMN models from
text, leveraging the use of machine learning and large language models. A key
contribution of this work is the introduction of a newly annotated dataset,
which significantly enhances the training process. Specifically, we augment the
PET dataset with 15 newly annotated documents containing 32 parallel gateways
for model training, a critical feature often overlooked in existing datasets.
This addition enables models to better capture parallel structures, a common
but complex aspect of process descriptions. The proposed approach demonstrates
adequate performance in terms of reconstruction accuracy, offering a promising
foundation for organizations to accelerate BPMN model creation.

Abstract: Lane changes of preceding vehicles have a great impact on the motion planning
of automated vehicles especially in complex traffic situations. Predicting them
would benefit the public in terms of safety and efficiency. While many research
efforts have been made in this direction, few concentrated on predicting
maneuvers within a set time interval compared to predicting at a set prediction
time. In addition, there exist a lack of comparisons between different
architectures to try to determine the best performing one and to assess how to
correctly choose the input for such models. In this paper the structure of an
LSTM, a CNN and a Transformer network are described and implemented to predict
the intention of human drivers to perform a lane change. We show how the data
was prepared starting from a publicly available dataset (highD), which features
were used, how the networks were designed and finally we compare the results of
the three networks with different configurations of input data. We found that
transformer networks performed better than the other networks and was less
affected by overfitting. The accuracy of the method spanned from $82.79\%$ to
$96.73\%$ for different input configurations and showed overall good
performances considering also precision and recall.

Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) represents a promising frontier at the
intersection of quantum computing and artificial intelligence, aiming to
leverage quantum computational advantages to enhance data-driven tasks. This
review explores the potential of QML to address the computational bottlenecks
of classical machine learning, particularly in processing complex datasets. We
introduce the theoretical foundations of QML, including quantum data encoding,
quantum learning theory and optimization techniques, while categorizing QML
approaches based on data type and computational architecture. It is
well-established that quantum computational advantages are problem-dependent,
and so potentially useful directions for QML need to be systematically
identified. Key developments, such as Quantum Principal Component Analysis,
quantum-enhanced sensing and applications in material science, are critically
evaluated for their theoretical speed-ups and practical limitations. The
challenges posed by Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, including
hardware noise, scalability constraints and data encoding overheads, are
discussed in detail. We also outline future directions, emphasizing the need
for quantum-native algorithms, improved error correction, and realistic
benchmarks to bridge the gap between theoretical promise and practical
deployment. This comprehensive analysis underscores that while QML has
significant potential for specific applications such as quantum chemistry and
sensing, its broader utility in real-world scenarios remains contingent on
overcoming technological and methodological hurdles.

Abstract: Cluster analysis is a fundamental research issue in statistics and machine
learning. In many modern clustering methods, we need to determine whether two
subsets of samples come from the same cluster. Since these subsets are usually
generated by certain clustering procedures, the deployment of classic
two-sample tests in this context would yield extremely smaller p-values,
leading to inflated Type-I error rate. To overcome this bias, we formally
introduce the two-cluster test issue and argue that it is a totally different
significance testing issue from conventional two-sample test. Meanwhile, we
present a new method based on the boundary points between two subsets to derive
an analytical p-value for the purpose of significance quantification.
Experiments on both synthetic and real data sets show that the proposed test is
able to significantly reduce the Type-I error rate, in comparison with several
classic two-sample testing methods. More importantly, the practical usage of
such two-cluster test is further verified through its applications in
tree-based interpretable clustering and significance-based hierarchical
clustering.

Abstract: Offline-to-online reinforcement learning (RL) aims to integrate the
complementary strengths of offline and online RL by pre-training an agent
offline and subsequently fine-tuning it through online interactions. However,
recent studies reveal that offline pre-trained agents often underperform during
online fine-tuning due to inaccurate value estimation caused by distribution
shift, with random initialization proving more effective in certain cases. In
this work, we propose a novel method, Online Pre-Training for Offline-to-Online
RL (OPT), explicitly designed to address the issue of inaccurate value
estimation in offline pre-trained agents. OPT introduces a new learning phase,
Online Pre-Training, which allows the training of a new value function tailored
specifically for effective online fine-tuning. Implementation of OPT on TD3 and
SPOT demonstrates an average 30% improvement in performance across a wide range
of D4RL environments, including MuJoCo, Antmaze, and Adroit.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for language
modeling, rivaling auto-regressive models by training-time scaling. However,
inference-time scaling in discrete diffusion models remains relatively
under-explored. In this work, we study sampling-based approaches for achieving
high-quality text generation from discrete diffusion models in reward-guided
settings. We introduce a novel inference-time scaling approach based on
particle Gibbs sampling for discrete diffusion models. The particle Gibbs
sampling algorithm iteratively refines full diffusion trajectories using
conditional Sequential Monte Carlo as its transition mechanism. This process
ensures that the updated samples progressively improve and move closer to the
reward-weighted target distribution. Unlike existing inference-time scaling
methods, which are often limited to single diffusion trajectories, our approach
leverages iterative refinement across multiple trajectories. Within this
framework, we further analyze the trade-offs between four key axes for
inference-time scaling under fixed compute budgets: particle Gibbs iterations,
particle count, denoising steps, and reward estimation cost. Empirically, our
method consistently outperforms prior inference-time strategies on
reward-guided text generation tasks, achieving significant improvement in
accuracy under varying compute budgets.

Abstract: Random telegraph noise is a prevalent variability phenomenon in
nanoelectronic devices, arising from stochastic carrier exchange at defect
sites and critically impacting device reliability and performance. Conventional
analysis techniques often rely on restrictive assumptions or manual
interventions, limiting their applicability to complex, noisy datasets. Here,
we introduce RTNinja, a generalized, fully automated machine learning framework
for the unsupervised analysis of random telegraph noise signals. RTNinja
deconvolves complex signals to identify the number and characteristics of
hidden individual sources, without requiring prior knowledge of the system. The
framework comprises two modular components: LevelsExtractor, which uses
Bayesian inference and model selection to denoise and discretize the signal;
and SourcesMapper, which infers source configurations through probabilistic
clustering and optimization. To evaluate performance, we developed a Monte
Carlo simulator that generates labeled datasets spanning broad signal-to-noise
ratios and source complexities; across 7000 such datasets, RTNinja consistently
demonstrated high-fidelity signal reconstruction and accurate extraction of
source amplitudes and activity patterns. Our results demonstrate that RTNinja
offers a robust, scalable, and device-agnostic tool for random telegraph noise
characterization, enabling large-scale statistical benchmarking,
reliability-centric technology qualification, predictive failure modeling, and
device physics exploration in next-generation nanoelectronics.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances language models by grounding
responses in external information, yet explainability remains a critical
challenge, particularly when retrieval relies on unstructured text. Knowledge
graphs (KGs) offer a solution by introducing structured, semantically rich
representations of entities and their relationships, enabling transparent
retrieval paths and interpretable reasoning. In this work, we present KGRAG-Ex,
a RAG system that improves both factual grounding and explainability by
leveraging a domain-specific KG constructed via prompt-based information
extraction. Given a user query, KGRAG-Ex identifies relevant entities and
semantic paths in the graph, which are then transformed into pseudo-paragraphs:
natural language representations of graph substructures that guide corpus
retrieval. To improve interpretability and support reasoning transparency, we
incorporate perturbation-based explanation methods that assess the influence of
specific KG-derived components on the generated answers. We conduct a series of
experiments to analyze the sensitivity of the system to different perturbation
methods, the relationship between graph component importance and their
structural positions, the influence of semantic node types, and how graph
metrics correspond to the influence of components within the explanations
process.

*Feijiang Li,Liuya Zhang,Jieting Wang,Tao Yan,Yuhua Qian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Rank Set Sampling (RSS)的MLP方法（RSS-MLP），通过减少经验损失的方差来提升模型的泛化能力。理论证明RSS比传统Simple Random Sampling (SRS)更能降低损失方差，实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MLP的泛化能力受经验损失方差影响，而Bagging方法通过SRS生成训练数据存在高度随机性，因此需要更有效的方法来减少方差。

Method: 提出RSS-MLP方法，利用RSS在训练数据中引入有序结构，进一步减少损失方差。

Result: 理论证明RSS比SRS更能降低经验指数损失和逻辑损失的方差；实验在12个基准数据集上验证了RSS-MLP的有效性。

Conclusion: RSS-MLP通过减少损失方差显著提升了MLP的泛化能力，是一种有效且合理的方法。

Abstract: Multilayer perceptron (MLP), one of the most fundamental neural networks, is
extensively utilized for classification and regression tasks. In this paper, we
establish a new generalization error bound, which reveals how the variance of
empirical loss influences the generalization ability of the learning model.
Inspired by this learning bound, we advocate to reduce the variance of
empirical loss to enhance the ability of MLP. As is well-known, bagging is a
popular ensemble method to realize variance reduction. However, bagging
produces the base training data sets by the Simple Random Sampling (SRS)
method, which exhibits a high degree of randomness. To handle this issue, we
introduce an ordered structure in the training data set by Rank Set Sampling
(RSS) to further reduce the variance of loss and develop a RSS-MLP method.
Theoretical results show that the variance of empirical exponential loss and
the logistic loss estimated by RSS are smaller than those estimated by SRS,
respectively. To validate the performance of RSS-MLP, we conduct comparison
experiments on twelve benchmark data sets in terms of the two convex loss
functions under two fusion methods. Extensive experimental results and analysis
illustrate the effectiveness and rationality of the propose method.

TL;DR: 比较三种优化器（AdamW、Lion、Sophia）在LLM预训练中的表现，Sophia表现最佳，Lion最快，AdamW在下游任务中效果最好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究优化器对减少LLM预训练时间和提升模型性能的影响。

Method: 使用两种基础架构和单/多轮训练方法，通过Maximal Update Parametrization调参，比较三种优化器的表现。

Result: Sophia训练和验证损失最低，Lion训练速度最快，AdamW在下游任务中表现最佳。

Conclusion: 不同优化器各有优势，Sophia适合低损失，Lion适合快速训练，AdamW适合下游任务。

Abstract: Optimizers play a decisive role in reducing pre-training times for LLMs and
achieving better-performing models. In this study, we compare three major
variants: the de-facto standard AdamW, the simpler Lion, developed through an
evolutionary search, and the second-order optimizer Sophia. For better
generalization, we train with two different base architectures and use a
single- and a multiple-epoch approach while keeping the number of tokens
constant. Using the Maximal Update Parametrization and smaller proxy models, we
tune relevant hyperparameters separately for each combination of base
architecture and optimizer. We found that while the results from all three
optimizers were in approximately the same range, Sophia exhibited the lowest
training and validation loss, Lion was fastest in terms of training GPU hours
but AdamW led to the best downstream evaluation results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估稀疏自动编码器和转码器可解释性的方法依赖生成单句解释，难以分离解释生成与评估过程，限制了直接评估的准确性。

Method: 采用无需自然语言解释的现有方法，直接评估稀疏编码器的可解释性，并与人类评估结果进行对比。

Result: 新方法提供了更直接且标准化的可解释性评估，与人类评估结果一致，为改进评估技术提供了依据。

Conclusion: 该方法为稀疏编码器的可解释性评估提供了更直接的途径，并建议社区改进评估技术。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and transcoders have become important tools for
machine learning interpretability. However, measuring how interpretable they
are remains challenging, with weak consensus about which benchmarks to use.
Most evaluation procedures start by producing a single-sentence explanation for
each latent. These explanations are then evaluated based on how well they
enable an LLM to predict the activation of a latent in new contexts. This
method makes it difficult to disentangle the explanation generation and
evaluation process from the actual interpretability of the latents discovered.
In this work, we adapt existing methods to assess the interpretability of
sparse coders, with the advantage that they do not require generating natural
language explanations as an intermediate step. This enables a more direct and
potentially standardized assessment of interpretability. Furthermore, we
compare the scores produced by our interpretability metrics with human
evaluations across similar tasks and varying setups, offering suggestions for
the community on improving the evaluation of these techniques.

TL;DR: SynBridge是一种基于双向流的生成模型，用于多任务反应预测，通过图到图变换和离散流桥捕获化学反应中的双向转化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 化学反应的本质是电子的重新分布和重组，通常表现为电子转移或电子对的迁移。这些变化在物理世界中是离散和突变的，因此需要一种能够有效建模状态转换的方法。

Method: SynBridge采用图到图变换网络架构和离散流桥，通过原子和键的离散状态捕获反应物和产物之间的双向化学转化。

Result: 在三个基准数据集（USPTO-50K、USPTO-MIT、Pistachio）上的实验表明，SynBridge在正向和逆向合成任务中均达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 结构化扩散在离散空间中对反应预测具有显著优势，SynBridge为化学反应建模提供了一种有效的方法。

Abstract: The essence of a chemical reaction lies in the redistribution and
reorganization of electrons, which is often manifested through electron
transfer or the migration of electron pairs. These changes are inherently
discrete and abrupt in the physical world, such as alterations in the charge
states of atoms or the formation and breaking of chemical bonds. To model the
transition of states, we propose SynBridge, a bidirectional flow-based
generative model to achieve multi-task reaction prediction. By leveraging a
graph-to-graph transformer network architecture and discrete flow bridges
between any two discrete distributions, SynBridge captures bidirectional
chemical transformations between graphs of reactants and products through the
bonds' and atoms' discrete states. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of
our method through extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets
(USPTO-50K, USPTO-MIT, Pistachio), achieving state-of-the-art performance in
both forward and retrosynthesis tasks. Our ablation studies and noise
scheduling analysis reveal the benefits of structured diffusion over discrete
spaces for reaction prediction.

Result: CPU在生成令牌时过度利用，GPU和NPU使用不足；GPU用于图像特征提取时饱和，导致设备响应性下降。

Conclusion: 当前部署框架存在CPU过度利用和GPU/NPU使用不稳定的问题，需优化硬件资源分配。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer promising capabilities for mobile
devices, but their deployment faces significant challenges due to computational
limitations and energy inefficiency, especially for real-time applications.
This study provides a comprehensive survey of deployment frameworks for VLMs on
mobile devices, evaluating llama.cpp, MLC-Imp, and mllm in the context of
running LLaVA-1.5 7B, MobileVLM-3B, and Imp-v1.5 3B as representative workloads
on a OnePlus 13R. Each deployment framework was evaluated on the OnePlus 13R
while running VLMs, with measurements covering CPU, GPU, and NPU utilization,
temperature, inference time, power consumption, and user experience.
Benchmarking revealed critical performance bottlenecks across frameworks: CPU
resources were consistently over-utilized during token generation, while GPU
and NPU accelerators were largely unused. When the GPU was used, primarily for
image feature extraction, it was saturated, leading to degraded device
responsiveness. The study contributes framework-level benchmarks, practical
profiling tools, and an in-depth analysis of hardware utilization bottlenecks,
highlighting the consistent overuse of CPUs and the ineffective or unstable use
of GPUs and NPUs in current deployment frameworks.

<details>

Motivation: SFL在异构环境中存在严重的灾难性遗忘问题，导致模型遗忘先前客户的知识。

Method: SFedKD采用多教师知识蒸馏，根据数据分布差异分配权重，并设计互补性教师选择机制以减少冗余。

Result: 实验表明SFedKD有效克服了灾难性遗忘，并优于现有FL方法。

Conclusion: SFedKD通过多教师知识蒸馏和教师选择机制，显著提升了SFL在异构环境中的性能。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning paradigm which
coordinates multiple clients to collaboratively train a global model via a
central server. Sequential Federated Learning (SFL) is a newly-emerging FL
training framework where the global model is trained in a sequential manner
across clients. Since SFL can provide strong convergence guarantees under data
heterogeneity, it has attracted significant research attention in recent years.
However, experiments show that SFL suffers from severe catastrophic forgetting
in heterogeneous environments, meaning that the model tends to forget knowledge
learned from previous clients. To address this issue, we propose an SFL
framework with discrepancy-aware multi-teacher knowledge distillation, called
SFedKD, which selects multiple models from the previous round to guide the
current round of training. In SFedKD, we extend the single-teacher Decoupled
Knowledge Distillation approach to our multi-teacher setting and assign
distinct weights to teachers' target-class and non-target-class knowledge based
on the class distributional discrepancy between teacher and student data.
Through this fine-grained weighting strategy, SFedKD can enhance model training
efficacy while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Additionally, to prevent
knowledge dilution, we eliminate redundant teachers for the knowledge
distillation and formalize it as a variant of the maximum coverage problem.
Based on the greedy strategy, we design a complementary-based teacher selection
mechanism to ensure that the selected teachers achieve comprehensive knowledge
space coverage while reducing communication and computational costs. Extensive
experiments show that SFedKD effectively overcomes catastrophic forgetting in
SFL and outperforms state-of-the-art FL methods.

Result: 实验表明，该方法能有效优化多样化目标，适用于确定性和随机环境。

Conclusion: 该方法具有通用性和实际应用潜力，可无缝集成到基于价值和演员-评论家算法中。

Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL), aligning agent behavior with specific
objectives typically requires careful design of the reward function, which can
be challenging when the desired objectives are complex. In this work, we
propose an alternative approach for flexible behavior alignment that eliminates
the need to modify the reward function by selecting appropriate reward
aggregation functions. By introducing an algebraic perspective on Markov
decision processes (MDPs), we show that the Bellman equations naturally emerge
from the recursive generation and aggregation of rewards, allowing for the
generalization of the standard discounted sum to other recursive aggregations,
such as discounted max and Sharpe ratio. Our approach applies to both
deterministic and stochastic settings and integrates seamlessly with
value-based and actor-critic algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that
our approach effectively optimizes diverse objectives, highlighting its
versatility and potential for real-world applications.

TL;DR: 提出CircFormerMoE框架，基于transformer和混合专家模型，直接从植物基因组DNA预测circRNA，解决了现有方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有circRNA识别方法依赖RNA-seq数据，计算成本高且效率低，尤其植物中circRNA剪接位点缺乏典型GT-AG模体，缺乏高效深度学习模型。

Method: CircFormerMoE框架包含剪接位点检测（SSD）和剪接位点配对（SSP）两个子任务，基于transformer和混合专家模型。

Result: 在10种植物基因数据上验证有效性，能发现未注释的circRNA，并提供模型可解释性分析。

Conclusion: CircFormerMoE为植物大规模circRNA发现提供快速准确的计算方法和工具，为功能基因组学和非编码RNA注释研究奠定基础。

Abstract: Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are important components of the non-coding RNA
regulatory network. Previous circRNA identification primarily relies on
high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data combined with alignment-based
algorithms that detect back-splicing signals. However, these methods face
several limitations: they can't predict circRNAs directly from genomic DNA
sequences and relies heavily on RNA experimental data; they involve high
computational costs due to complex alignment and filtering steps; and they are
inefficient for large-scale or genome-wide circRNA prediction. The challenge is
even greater in plants, where plant circRNA splice sites often lack the
canonical GT-AG motif seen in human mRNA splicing, and no efficient deep
learning model with strong generalization capability currently exists.
Furthermore, the number of currently identified plant circRNAs is likely far
lower than their true abundance. In this paper, we propose a deep learning
framework named CircFormerMoE based on transformers and mixture-of experts for
predicting circRNAs directly from plant genomic DNA. Our framework consists of
two subtasks known as splicing site detection (SSD) and splicing site pairing
(SSP). The model's effectiveness has been validated on gene data of 10 plant
species. Trained on known circRNA instances, it is also capable of discovering
previously unannotated circRNAs. In addition, we performed interpretability
analyses on the trained model to investigate the sequence patterns contributing
to its predictions. Our framework provides a fast and accurate computational
method and tool for large-scale circRNA discovery in plants, laying a
foundation for future research in plant functional genomics and non-coding RNA
annotation.

Result: 在NGSIM和HighD数据集上，平均预测误差分别降低了4.8%和31.2%，尤其在高风险场景中表现更优。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了可解释的风险感知预测，有助于自动驾驶系统做出更稳健的决策。

Abstract: Accurate vehicle trajectory prediction is essential for ensuring safety and
efficiency in fully autonomous driving systems. While existing methods
primarily focus on modeling observed motion patterns and interactions with
other vehicles, they often neglect the potential risks posed by the uncertain
or aggressive behaviors of surrounding vehicles. In this paper, we propose a
novel spatial-temporal risk-attentive trajectory prediction framework that
incorporates a risk potential field to assess perceived risks arising from
behaviors of nearby vehicles. The framework leverages a spatial-temporal
encoder and a risk-attentive feature fusion decoder to embed the risk potential
field into the extracted spatial-temporal feature representations for
trajectory prediction. A risk-scaled loss function is further designed to
improve the prediction accuracy of high-risk scenarios, such as short relative
spacing. Experiments on the widely used NGSIM and HighD datasets demonstrate
that our method reduces average prediction errors by 4.8% and 31.2%
respectively compared to state-of-the-art approaches, especially in high-risk
scenarios. The proposed framework provides interpretable, risk-aware
predictions, contributing to more robust decision-making for autonomous driving
systems.

Method: 采用递归的块式迭代编码器，在潜在空间进行迭代，无需特殊数据集或训练协议。

Result: 在零样本学习中提升12%，语言困惑度提升5%，支持动态计算扩展。

Conclusion: AbbIE为Transformer性能扩展提供了新途径。

Abstract: We introduce the Autoregressive Block-Based Iterative Encoder (AbbIE), a
novel recursive generalization of the encoder-only Transformer architecture,
which achieves better perplexity than a standard Transformer and allows for the
dynamic scaling of compute resources at test time. This simple, recursive
approach is a complement to scaling large language model (LLM) performance
through parameter and token counts. AbbIE performs its iterations in latent
space, but unlike latent reasoning models, does not require a specialized
dataset or training protocol. We show that AbbIE upward generalizes (ability to
generalize to arbitrary iteration lengths) at test time by only using 2
iterations during train time, far outperforming alternative iterative methods.
AbbIE's ability to scale its computational expenditure based on the complexity
of the task gives it an up to \textbf{12\%} improvement in zero-shot in-context
learning tasks versus other iterative and standard methods and up to 5\%
improvement in language perplexity. The results from this study open a new
avenue to Transformer performance scaling. We perform all of our evaluations on
model sizes up to 350M parameters.

Abstract: Machine learning models are commonly used for malware classification;
however, they suffer from performance degradation over time due to concept
drift. Adapting these models to changing data distributions requires frequent
updates, which rely on costly ground truth annotations. While active learning
can reduce the annotation burden, leveraging unlabeled data through
semi-supervised learning remains a relatively underexplored approach in the
context of malware detection. In this research, we introduce \texttt{ADAPT}, a
novel pseudo-labeling semi-supervised algorithm for addressing concept drift.
Our model-agnostic method can be applied to various machine learning models,
including neural networks and tree-based algorithms. We conduct extensive
experiments on five diverse malware detection datasets spanning Android,
Windows, and PDF domains. The results demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms baseline models and competitive benchmarks. This work paves the way
for more effective adaptation of machine learning models to concept drift in
malware detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水稻种植消耗大量淡水，可持续灌溉实践（如DSR和AWD）可显著节水，但缺乏采用率数据阻碍政策制定。

Method: 开发基于Sentinel-1卫星影像的分类系统，结合地面数据（PRANA项目），区分不同灌溉实践。

Result: 分类系统F1-score达78%，能大规模监测DSR采用情况，预测结果与政府数据高度相关（Pearson=0.77）。

Conclusion: 该框架为政策制定者提供了监测可持续灌溉实践的工具，有助于资源分配和项目评估。

Abstract: Rice cultivation consumes 24-30% of global freshwater, creating critical
water management challenges in major rice-producing regions. Sustainable
irrigation practices like direct seeded rice (DSR) and alternate wetting and
drying (AWD) can reduce water use by 20-40% while maintaining yields, helping
secure long-term agricultural productivity as water scarcity intensifies - a
key component of the Zero Hunger Sustainable Development Goal. However, limited
data on adoption rates of these practices prevents evidence-based policymaking
and targeted resource allocation. We developed a novel remote sensing framework
to monitor sustainable water management practices at scale in Punjab, India - a
region facing severe groundwater depletion of 41.6 cm/year. To collect
essential ground truth data, we partnered with the Nature Conservancy's
Promoting Regenerative and No-burn Agriculture (PRANA) program, which trained
approximately 1,400 farmers on water-saving techniques while documenting their
field-level practices. Using this data, we created a classification system with
Sentinel-1 satellite imagery that separates water management along sowing and
irrigation dimensions. Our approach achieved a 78% F1-score in distinguishing
DSR from traditional puddled transplanted rice without requiring prior
knowledge of planting dates. We demonstrated scalability by mapping DSR
adoption across approximately 3 million agricultural plots in Punjab, with
district-level predictions showing strong correlation (Pearson=0.77, RBO= 0.77)
with government records. This study provides policymakers with a powerful tool
to track sustainable water management adoption, target interventions, and
measure program impacts at scale.

Conclusion: LoGIC通过游戏化学习有效提升无监督图像描述性能，展示了多智能体强化学习的潜力。

Abstract: Image captioning is an important problem in developing various AI systems,
and these tasks require large volumes of annotated images to train the models.
Since all existing labelled datasets are already used for training the large
Vision Language Models (VLMs), it becomes challenging to improve the
performance of the same. Considering this, it is essential to consider the
unsupervised image captioning performance, which remains relatively
under-explored. To that end, we propose LoGIC (Lewis Communication Game for
Image Captioning), a Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning game. The proposed
method consists of two agents, a 'speaker' and a 'listener', with the objective
of learning a strategy for communicating in natural language. We train agents
in the cooperative common-reward setting using the GRPO algorithm and show that
improvement in image captioning performance emerges as a consequence of the
agents learning to play the game. We show that using pre-trained VLMs as the
'speaker' and Large Language Model (LLM) for language understanding in the
'listener', we achieved a $46$ BLEU score after fine-tuning using LoGIC without
additional labels, a $2$ units advantage in absolute metrics compared to the
$44$ BLEU score of the vanilla VLM. Additionally, we replace the VLM from the
'speaker' with lightweight components: (i) a ViT for image perception and (ii)
a GPT2 language generation, and train them from scratch using LoGIC, obtaining
a $31$ BLEU score in the unsupervised setting, a $10$ points advantage over
existing unsupervised image-captioning methods.

Abstract: Collaborative fairness is a crucial challenge in federated learning. However,
existing approaches often overlook a practical yet complex form of
heterogeneity: imbalanced covariate shift. We provide a theoretical analysis of
this setting, which motivates the design of FedAKD (Federated Asynchronous
Knowledge Distillation)- simple yet effective approach that balances accurate
prediction with collaborative fairness. FedAKD consists of client and server
updates. In the client update, we introduce a novel asynchronous knowledge
distillation strategy based on our preliminary analysis, which reveals that
while correctly predicted samples exhibit similar feature distributions across
clients, incorrectly predicted samples show significant variability. This
suggests that imbalanced covariate shift primarily arises from misclassified
samples. Leveraging this insight, our approach first applies traditional
knowledge distillation to update client models while keeping the global model
fixed. Next, we select correctly predicted high-confidence samples and update
the global model using these samples while keeping client models fixed. The
server update simply aggregates all client models. We further provide a
theoretical proof of FedAKD's convergence. Experimental results on public
datasets (FashionMNIST and CIFAR10) and a real-world Electronic Health Records
(EHR) dataset demonstrate that FedAKD significantly improves collaborative
fairness, enhances predictive accuracy, and fosters client participation even
under highly heterogeneous data distributions.

*Vincenzo Dentamaro*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: WERSA是一种线性时间复杂度的注意力机制，显著降低了长序列处理的计算成本，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Transformer模型在长序列上计算成本高的问题，提出一种更高效的注意力机制。

Method: 结合内容自适应随机频谱特征、多分辨率Haar小波和可学习参数，实现线性时间复杂度的选择性注意力。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现最佳，显著减少训练时间和计算资源，同时提高准确性。

Conclusion: WERSA为长上下文模型提供了更实用、更经济的解决方案，推动了可持续和可扩展的AI发展。

Abstract: Transformer models are computationally costly on long sequences since regular
attention has quadratic $O(n^2)$ time complexity. We introduce Wavelet-Enhanced
Random Spectral Attention (WERSA), a novel mechanism of linear $O(n)$ time
complexity that is pivotal to enable successful long-sequence processing
without the performance trade-off. WERSA merges content-adaptive random
spectral features together with multi-resolution Haar wavelets and learnable
parameters to selectively attend to informative scales of data while preserving
linear efficiency.
  Large-scale comparisons \textbf{on single GPU} and across various benchmarks
(vision, NLP, hierarchical reasoning) and various attention mechanisms (like
Multiheaded Attention, Flash-Attention-2, FNet, Linformer, Performer,
Waveformer), reveal uniform advantages of WERSA. It achieves best accuracy in
all tests. On ArXiv classification, WERSA improves accuracy over vanilla
attention by 1.2\% (86.2\% vs 85.0\%) while cutting training time by 81\% (296s
vs 1554s) and FLOPS by 73.4\% (26.2G vs 98.4G). Significantly, WERSA excels
where vanilla and FlashAttention-2 fail: on ArXiv-128k's extremely lengthy
sequences, it achieves best accuracy (79.1\%) and AUC (0.979) among viable
methods, operating on data that gives Out-Of-Memory errors to quadratic methods
while being \textbf{twice as fast} as Waveformer, its next-best competitor.
  By significantly reducing computational loads without compromising accuracy,
WERSA makes possible more practical, more affordable, long-context models, in
particular on low-resource hardware, for more sustainable and more scalable AI
development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统理论认为模型容量增加会导致过拟合，但实践中很少见。论文探讨了局部过拟合的可能性及其与双下降现象的联系。

Method: 提出了一种两阶段方法：1) 将检查点聚合为集成模型；2) 通过知识蒸馏将其压缩为原始大小的单一模型。

Result: 在多个数据集和架构上的实验表明，该方法在标签噪声情况下优于原始模型和独立训练的集成模型。

Conclusion: 局部过拟合确实存在，且通过知识融合与蒸馏可以提升性能，同时降低训练和推理复杂度。

Abstract: Overfitting in deep neural networks occurs less frequently than expected.
This is a puzzling observation, as theory predicts that greater model capacity
should eventually lead to overfitting -- yet this is rarely seen in practice.
But what if overfitting does occur, not globally, but in specific sub-regions
of the data space? In this work, we introduce a novel score that measures the
forgetting rate of deep models on validation data, capturing what we term local
overfitting: a performance degradation confined to certain regions of the input
space. We demonstrate that local overfitting can arise even without
conventional overfitting, and is closely linked to the double descent
phenomenon.
  Building on these insights, we introduce a two-stage approach that leverages
the training history of a single model to recover and retain forgotten
knowledge: first, by aggregating checkpoints into an ensemble, and then by
distilling it into a single model of the original size, thus enhancing
performance without added inference cost.
  Extensive experiments across multiple datasets, modern architectures, and
training regimes validate the effectiveness of our approach. Notably, in the
presence of label noise, our method -- Knowledge Fusion followed by Knowledge
Distillation -- outperforms both the original model and independently trained
ensembles, achieving a rare win-win scenario: reduced training and inference
complexity.

Result: MAD-OPT框架在不同环境条件下能估计出领域知识支持的最优工艺条件，且结果稳健；还能估计超出设计功率限制的最优条件，与实际数据相符。

Conclusion: 未结合领域知识的优化分析可能提供无效解，MAD-OPT框架为热电厂中AI的安全应用提供了新途径。

Abstract: The domain-consistent adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) remains low in
thermal power plants due to the black-box nature of AI algorithms and low
representation of domain knowledge in conventional data-centric analytics. In
this paper, we develop a MAhalanobis Distance-based OPTimization (MAD-OPT)
framework that incorporates the Mahalanobis distance-based constraint to
introduce domain knowledge into data-centric analytics. The developed MAD-OPT
framework is applied to maximize thermal efficiency and minimize turbine heat
rate for a 395 MW capacity gas turbine system. We demonstrate that the MAD-OPT
framework can estimate domain-informed optimal process conditions under
different ambient conditions, and the optimal solutions are found to be robust
as evaluated by Monte Carlo simulations. We also apply the MAD-OPT framework to
estimate optimal process conditions beyond the design power generation limit of
the gas turbine system, and have found comparable results with the actual data
of the power plant. We demonstrate that implementing data-centric optimization
analytics without incorporating domain-informed constraints may provide
ineffective solutions that may not be implementable in the real operation of
the gas turbine system. This research advances the integration of the
data-driven domain knowledge into machine learning-powered analytics that
enhances the domain-informed operation excellence and paves the way for safe AI
adoption in thermal power systems.

Method: 在大规模实验中（超过50万次训练种子），分析距离项和MDP正则化的组合效果。

Result: 两种正则化技术可以部分替代，但精确组合对鲁棒性能至关重要。

Conclusion: 研究为RL中更鲁棒算法的设计提供了方向，尤其是针对超参数敏感性。

Abstract: Policy Mirror Descent (PMD) has emerged as a unifying framework in
reinforcement learning (RL) by linking policy gradient methods with a
first-order optimization method known as mirror descent. At its core, PMD
incorporates two key regularization components: (i) a distance term that
enforces a trust region for stable policy updates and (ii) an MDP regularizer
that augments the reward function to promote structure and robustness. While
PMD has been extensively studied in theory, empirical investigations remain
scarce. This work provides a large-scale empirical analysis of the interplay
between these two regularization techniques, running over 500k training seeds
on small RL environments. Our results demonstrate that, although the two
regularizers can partially substitute each other, their precise combination is
critical for achieving robust performance. These findings highlight the
potential for advancing research on more robust algorithms in RL, particularly
with respect to hyperparameter sensitivity.

Motivation: 测试时数据偏移是预测模型部署中的常见问题，TTA方法虽能暂时适应，但模型最终可能失效，需监控性能。

Method: 扩展了基于顺序测试的监控工具，结合置信序列，适应无标签测试数据和模型更新的场景。

Result: 提出的TTA监控框架在多种数据集、分布偏移类型和TTA方法中表现有效。

Conclusion: 结合TTA与风险监控能有效检测模型失效点，提升模型部署的可靠性。

Abstract: Encountering shifted data at test time is a ubiquitous challenge when
deploying predictive models. Test-time adaptation (TTA) methods address this
issue by continuously adapting a deployed model using only unlabeled test data.
While TTA can extend the model's lifespan, it is only a temporary solution.
Eventually the model might degrade to the point that it must be taken offline
and retrained. To detect such points of ultimate failure, we propose pairing
TTA with risk monitoring frameworks that track predictive performance and raise
alerts when predefined performance criteria are violated. Specifically, we
extend existing monitoring tools based on sequential testing with confidence
sequences to accommodate scenarios in which the model is updated at test time
and no test labels are available to estimate the performance metrics of
interest. Our extensions unlock the application of rigorous statistical risk
monitoring to TTA, and we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed TTA
monitoring framework across a representative set of datasets, distribution
shift types, and TTA methods.

Result: 实验表明该方法在平衡灾难性遗忘缓解和新任务性能方面表现优越。

Conclusion: 该方法为缓解灾难性遗忘提供了新视角，优于传统方法。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting in deep neural networks occurs when learning new
tasks degrades performance on previously learned tasks due to knowledge
overwriting. Among the approaches to mitigate this issue, regularization
techniques aim to identify and constrain "important" parameters to preserve
previous knowledge. In the highly nonconvex optimization landscape of deep
learning, we propose a novel perspective: tracking parameters during the final
training plateau is more effective than monitoring them throughout the entire
training process. We argue that parameters that exhibit higher activity
(movement and variability) during this plateau reveal directions in the loss
landscape that are relatively flat, making them suitable for adaptation to new
tasks while preserving knowledge from previous ones. Our comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that this approach achieves superior performance in
balancing catastrophic forgetting mitigation with strong performance on newly
learned tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准NVAR和RC在混沌系统预测中表现良好，但固定非线性结构和计算成本限制了其在高噪声或高维数据中的适应性。

Method: 结合延迟嵌入线性输入和浅层可学习MLP，通过梯度优化联合训练，避免了对参数网格搜索的需求。

Result: 在噪声和无噪声条件下，自适应模型预测精度优于标准NVAR，且在低观测频率下表现稳健。

Conclusion: 自适应NVAR模型通过数据驱动的非线性学习，提高了预测性能和适应性，同时简化了调参过程。

Abstract: Nonlinear vector autoregression (NVAR) and reservoir computing (RC) have
shown promise in forecasting chaotic dynamical systems, such as the Lorenz-63
model and El Nino-Southern Oscillation. However, their reliance on fixed
nonlinearities - polynomial expansions in NVAR or random feature maps in RC -
limits their adaptability to high noise or real-world data. These methods also
scale poorly in high-dimensional settings due to costly matrix inversion during
readout computation. We propose an adaptive NVAR model that combines
delay-embedded linear inputs with features generated by a shallow, learnable
multi-layer perceptron (MLP). The MLP and linear readout are jointly trained
using gradient-based optimization, enabling the model to learn data-driven
nonlinearities while preserving a simple readout structure. Unlike standard
NVAR, our approach avoids the need for an exhaustive and sensitive grid search
over ridge and delay parameters. Instead, tuning is restricted to neural
network hyperparameters, improving scalability. Initial experiments on chaotic
systems tested under noise-free and synthetically noisy conditions showed that
the adaptive model outperformed the standard NVAR in predictive accuracy and
showed robust forecasting under noisy conditions with a lower observation
frequency.

Result: 在Burgers方程和Navier-Stokes方程中，PHQFNO达到了经典FNO的准确性，并在不可压缩Navier-Stokes中表现更优。

Conclusion: PHQFNO展示了量子-经典混合方法在科学机器学习中的潜力，尤其是在高维问题和噪声环境下的稳定性优势。

Abstract: We introduce the Partitioned Hybrid Quantum Fourier Neural Operator (PHQFNO),
a generalization of the Quantum Fourier Neural Operator (QFNO) for scientific
machine learning. PHQFNO partitions the Fourier operator computation across
classical and quantum resources, enabling tunable quantum-classical
hybridization and distributed execution across quantum and classical devices.
The method extends QFNOs to higher dimensions and incorporates a
message-passing framework to distribute data across different partitions. Input
data are encoded into quantum states using unary encoding, and quantum circuit
parameters are optimized using a variational scheme. We implement PHQFNO using
PennyLane with PyTorch integration and evaluate it on Burgers' equation,
incompressible and compressible Navier-Stokes equations. We show that PHQFNO
recovers classical FNO accuracy. On incompressible Navier-Stokes, PHQFNO
achieves higher accuracy than its classical counterparts. Finally, we perform a
sensitivity analysis under input noise, confirming improved stability of PHQFNO
over classical baselines.

Conclusion: CGKN框架展示了科学机器学习模型与其他外环应用（如设计优化、反问题和最优控制）的统一开发潜力。

Abstract: A discrete-time conditional Gaussian Koopman network (CGKN) is developed in
this work to learn surrogate models that can perform efficient state forecast
and data assimilation (DA) for high-dimensional complex dynamical systems,
e.g., systems governed by nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs).
Focusing on nonlinear partially observed systems that are common in many
engineering and earth science applications, this work exploits Koopman
embedding to discover a proper latent representation of the unobserved system
states, such that the dynamics of the latent states are conditional linear,
i.e., linear with the given observed system states. The modeled system of the
observed and latent states then becomes a conditional Gaussian system, for
which the posterior distribution of the latent states is Gaussian and can be
efficiently evaluated via analytical formulae. The analytical formulae of DA
facilitate the incorporation of DA performance into the learning process of the
modeled system, which leads to a framework that unifies scientific machine
learning (SciML) and data assimilation. The performance of discrete-time CGKN
is demonstrated on several canonical problems governed by nonlinear PDEs with
intermittency and turbulent features, including the viscous Burgers' equation,
the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and the 2-D Navier-Stokes equations, with
which we show that the discrete-time CGKN framework achieves comparable
performance as the state-of-the-art SciML methods in state forecast and
provides efficient and accurate DA results. The discrete-time CGKN framework
also serves as an example to illustrate unifying the development of SciML
models and their other outer-loop applications such as design optimization,
inverse problems, and optimal control.

Conclusion: AutoSlim通过智能修剪有效降低了硬件资源消耗，同时解决了符号加速器的可扩展性问题。

Abstract: Symbolic accelerators are increasingly used for symbolic data processing in
domains such as genomics, NLP, and cybersecurity. However, these accelerators
face scalability issues due to excessive memory use and routing complexity,
especially when targeting a large set. We present AutoSlim, a machine
learning-based graph simplification framework designed to reduce the complexity
of symbolic accelerators built on Non-deterministic Finite Automata (NFA)
deployed on FPGA-based overlays such as NAPOLY+. AutoSlim uses Random Forest
classification to prune low-impact transitions based on edge scores and
structural features, significantly reducing automata graph density while
preserving semantic correctness. Unlike prior tools, AutoSlim targets automated
score-aware simplification with weighted transitions, enabling efficient
ranking-based sequence analysis. We evaluated data sets (1K to 64K nodes) in
NAPOLY+ and conducted performance measurements including latency, throughput,
and resource usage. AutoSlim achieves up to 40 percent reduction in FPGA LUTs
and over 30 percent pruning in transitions, while scaling to graphs an order of
magnitude larger than existing benchmarks. Our results also demonstrate how
hardware interconnection (fanout) heavily influences hardware cost and that
AutoSlim's pruning mitigates resource blowup.

Conclusion: PARS算法有效解决了Q值外推问题，提升了离线强化学习性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with offline data suffers from Q-value extrapolation
errors. To address this issue, we first demonstrate that linear extrapolation
of the Q-function beyond the data range is particularly problematic. To
mitigate this, we propose guiding the gradual decrease of Q-values outside the
data range, which is achieved through reward scaling with layer normalization
(RS-LN) and a penalization mechanism for infeasible actions (PA). By combining
RS-LN and PA, we develop a new algorithm called PARS. We evaluate PARS across a
range of tasks, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art
algorithms in both offline training and online fine-tuning on the D4RL
benchmark, with notable success in the challenging AntMaze Ultra task.

Motivation: 解决传统MoE架构中非可微、不灵活的路由问题，以及稀疏性不足对加速技术的限制。

Result: BlockFFN在稀疏性和性能上优于基线，TLS超过80%，8-token CLS达70%，在终端设备上实现3.67倍加速。

Conclusion: BlockFFN是一种高效且加速友好的MoE架构，适用于低资源场景。

Abstract: To alleviate the computational burden of large language models (LLMs),
architectures with activation sparsity, represented by mixture-of-experts
(MoE), have attracted increasing attention. However, the non-differentiable and
inflexible routing of vanilla MoE hurts model performance. Moreover, while each
token activates only a few parameters, these sparsely-activated architectures
exhibit low chunk-level sparsity, indicating that the union of multiple
consecutive tokens activates a large ratio of parameters. Such a sparsity
pattern is unfriendly for acceleration under low-resource conditions (e.g.,
end-side devices) and incompatible with mainstream acceleration techniques
(e.g., speculative decoding). To address these challenges, we introduce a novel
MoE architecture, BlockFFN, as well as its efficient training and deployment
techniques. Specifically, we use a router integrating ReLU activation and
RMSNorm for differentiable and flexible routing. Next, to promote both
token-level sparsity (TLS) and chunk-level sparsity (CLS), CLS-aware training
objectives are designed, making BlockFFN more acceleration-friendly. Finally,
we implement efficient acceleration kernels, combining activation sparsity and
speculative decoding for the first time. The experimental results demonstrate
the superior performance of BlockFFN over other MoE baselines, achieving over
80% TLS and 70% 8-token CLS. Our kernels achieve up to 3.67$\times$ speedup on
real end-side devices than dense models. All codes and checkpoints are
available publicly (https://github.com/thunlp/BlockFFN).

Result: 理论证明GreedyLore在MSGD和Adam下达到线性加速收敛率，实验验证其优越性。

Conclusion: GreedyLore填补了贪心压缩缺乏收敛保证的空白，为分布式学习提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Distributed optimization is pivotal for large-scale signal processing and
machine learning, yet communication overhead remains a major bottleneck.
Low-rank gradient compression, in which the transmitted gradients are
approximated by low-rank matrices to reduce communication, offers a promising
remedy. Existing methods typically adopt either randomized or greedy
compression strategies: randomized approaches project gradients onto randomly
chosen subspaces, introducing high variance and degrading empirical
performance; greedy methods select the most informative subspaces, achieving
strong empirical results but lacking convergence guarantees. To address this
gap, we propose GreedyLore--the first Greedy Low-Rank gradient compression
algorithm for distributed learning with rigorous convergence guarantees.
GreedyLore incorporates error feedback to correct the bias introduced by greedy
compression and introduces a semi-lazy subspace update that ensures the
compression operator remains contractive throughout all iterations. With these
techniques, we prove that GreedyLore achieves a convergence rate of
$\mathcal{O}(\sigma/\sqrt{NT} + 1/T)$ under standard optimizers such as MSGD
and Adam--marking the first linear speedup convergence rate for low-rank
gradient compression. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate our
theoretical findings.

Result: 实验证明ORAC在连续控制任务中显著改善奖励-成本权衡。

Conclusion: ORAC有效避免次优策略，提升风险规避强化学习的性能。

Abstract: Risk-averse Constrained Reinforcement Learning (RaCRL) aims to learn policies
that minimise the likelihood of rare and catastrophic constraint violations
caused by an environment's inherent randomness. In general, risk-aversion leads
to conservative exploration of the environment which typically results in
converging to sub-optimal policies that fail to adequately maximise reward or,
in some cases, fail to achieve the goal. In this paper, we propose an
exploration-based approach for RaCRL called Optimistic Risk-averse Actor Critic
(ORAC), which constructs an exploratory policy by maximising a local upper
confidence bound of the state-action reward value function whilst minimising a
local lower confidence bound of the risk-averse state-action cost value
function. Specifically, at each step, the weighting assigned to the cost value
is increased or decreased if it exceeds or falls below the safety constraint
value. This way the policy is encouraged to explore uncertain regions of the
environment to discover high reward states whilst still satisfying the safety
constraints. Our experimental results demonstrate that the ORAC approach
prevents convergence to sub-optimal policies and improves significantly the
reward-cost trade-off in various continuous control tasks such as
Safety-Gymnasium and a complex building energy management environment
CityLearn.

over rigid rule-based metrics, especially for complex reasoning tasks involving
free-form outputs. In this paradigm, an LLM is typically prompted to compare a
candidate answer against a ground-truth reference and assign a binary reward
indicating correctness. Despite the seeming simplicity of this comparison task,
we find that generative reward models exhibit surprising vulnerabilities to
superficial manipulations: non-word symbols (e.g., ":" or ".") or reasoning
openers like "Thought process:" and "Let's solve this problem step by step."
can often lead to false positive rewards. We demonstrate that this weakness is
widespread across LLMs, datasets, and prompt formats, posing a serious threat
for core algorithmic paradigms that rely on generative reward models, such as
rejection sampling, preference optimization, and RLVR. To mitigate this issue,
we introduce a simple yet effective data augmentation strategy and train a new
generative reward model with substantially improved robustness. Our findings
highlight the urgent need for more reliable LLM-based evaluation methods. We

### [211] [The Non-Linear Representation Dilemma: Is Causal Abstraction Enough for Mechanistic Interpretability?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08802)
*Denis Sutter,Julian Minder,Thomas Hofmann,Tiago Pimentel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文探讨了因果抽象在机器学习模型解释中的局限性，指出无限制的对齐映射会导致因果抽象变得无意义，并提出了非线性表示困境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动机是揭示因果抽象在解释机器学习模型决策过程中的局限性，特别是在无限制对齐映射的情况下。

Method: 方法包括理论证明和实证研究，证明任何神经网络都可以映射到任何算法，并通过随机初始化的语言模型实验验证。

Result: 结果显示，无限制的对齐映射会导致因果抽象变得无意义，且实验证明即使模型无法完成任务，也能实现完美的映射。

Conclusion: 结论是因果抽象不足以支持机制解释性，未来研究应关注信息编码假设与因果抽象的关系。

Abstract: The concept of causal abstraction got recently popularised to demystify the
opaque decision-making processes of machine learning models; in short, a neural
network can be abstracted as a higher-level algorithm if there exists a
function which allows us to map between them. Notably, most interpretability
papers implement these maps as linear functions, motivated by the linear
representation hypothesis: the idea that features are encoded linearly in a
model's representations. However, this linearity constraint is not required by
the definition of causal abstraction. In this work, we critically examine the
concept of causal abstraction by considering arbitrarily powerful alignment
maps. In particular, we prove that under reasonable assumptions, any neural
network can be mapped to any algorithm, rendering this unrestricted notion of
causal abstraction trivial and uninformative. We complement these theoretical
findings with empirical evidence, demonstrating that it is possible to
perfectly map models to algorithms even when these models are incapable of
solving the actual task; e.g., on an experiment using randomly initialised
language models, our alignment maps reach 100% interchange-intervention
accuracy on the indirect object identification task. This raises the non-linear
representation dilemma: if we lift the linearity constraint imposed to
alignment maps in causal abstraction analyses, we are left with no principled
way to balance the inherent trade-off between these maps' complexity and
accuracy. Together, these results suggest an answer to our title's question:
causal abstraction is not enough for mechanistic interpretability, as it
becomes vacuous without assumptions about how models encode information.
Studying the connection between this information-encoding assumption and causal
abstraction should lead to exciting future work.

TL;DR: AgentsNet是一个新的多智能体推理基准，用于评估多智能体系统在网络拓扑下的协作、自组织和通信能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多智能体系统在复杂网络中的自组织和协作能力，填补现有基准在小规模智能体评估上的不足。

Method: 通过借鉴分布式系统和图论中的经典问题，设计AgentsNet基准，评估多智能体系统的协作策略形成能力。

Conclusion: AgentsNet为多智能体系统的评估提供了可扩展的新基准，揭示了LLM在大规模网络中的局限性。

Abstract: Large-language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful problem-solving
capabilities, in particular when organized in multi-agent systems. However, the
advent of such systems also raises several questions on the ability of a
complex network of agents to effectively self-organize and collaborate. While
measuring performance on standard reasoning benchmarks indicates how well
multi-agent systems can solve reasoning tasks, it is unclear whether these
systems are able to leverage their topology effectively. Here, we propose
AgentsNet, a new benchmark for multi-agent reasoning. By drawing inspiration
from classical problems in distributed systems and graph theory, AgentsNet
measures the ability of multi-agent systems to collaboratively form strategies
for problem-solving, self-organization, and effective communication given a
network topology. We evaluate a variety of baseline methods on AgentsNet
including homogeneous networks of agents which first have to agree on basic
protocols for organization and communication. We find that some frontier LLMs
are already demonstrating strong performance for small networks but begin to
fall off once the size of the network scales. While existing multi-agent
benchmarks cover at most 2-5 agents, AgentsNet is practically unlimited in size
and can scale with new generations of LLMs. As such, we also probe frontier
models in a setup with up to 100 agents.

TL;DR: 论文提出PUMA方法，通过层剪枝和模态自适应学习提升统一多模态检索的效率，减少资源消耗同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多媒体内容增长，统一多模态检索需求增加，但现有大模型训练成本高且推理效率低。

Method: 提出层剪枝自蒸馏（减少参数）和模态自适应对比学习损失（提升学习效率）。

Result: 实验表明方法显著减少资源使用且性能强劲。

Conclusion: PUMA通过结构和学习优化，高效解决了统一多模态检索问题。

Abstract: As multimedia content expands, the demand for unified multimodal retrieval
(UMR) in real-world applications increases. Recent work leverages multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) to tackle this task. However, their large
parameter size results in high training costs and low inference efficiency. To
address this, we propose PUMA: a Layer-Pruned Language Model for Efficient
Unified Multimodal Retrieval with Modality-Adaptive Learning. Our approach
improves UMR from both structural and learning perspectives. (1) Structurally,
we propose Layer-Pruned Self-Distillation, which prunes MLLMs by keeping only
shallow layers while distilling features from dropped deep layers as teacher
signals. This reduces parameters and preserves representation capability. (2)
On the learning side, we introduce Modality-Adaptive Contrastive Learning Loss
(MAC-Loss), which separates in-batch negatives into harder intra-modality and
easier inter-modality groups based on the target modality, assigning different
temperature strategies to enhance learning efficiency. Experiments show our
method significantly reduces resource usage while maintaining strong
performance.

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: 论文研究了社交媒体上金融影响者（finfluencers）的多模态信号对股票推荐的影响，并提出了VideoConviction数据集用于评估多模态和文本大模型在金融话语中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解金融影响者的多模态信号（如语气、表达方式和面部表情）对股票推荐的影响，超越传统的文本分析。

Method: 引入VideoConviction数据集，包含6000多个专家标注，用于评估多模态和文本大模型在金融话语中的表现。

Result: 多模态输入提高了股票代码提取的准确性，但模型难以区分投资行为和信念强度。反向策略（对抗金融影响者推荐）的年回报率比标普500高6.8%，但风险更大。

Conclusion: VideoConviction数据集为多模态金融研究提供了基准，推动了多模态任务的深入发展。

Abstract: Social media has amplified the reach of financial influencers known as
"finfluencers," who share stock recommendations on platforms like YouTube.
Understanding their influence requires analyzing multimodal signals like tone,
delivery style, and facial expressions, which extend beyond text-based
financial analysis. We introduce VideoConviction, a multimodal dataset with
6,000+ expert annotations, produced through 457 hours of human effort, to
benchmark multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and text-based large
language models (LLMs) in financial discourse. Our results show that while
multimodal inputs improve stock ticker extraction (e.g., extracting Apple's
ticker AAPL), both MLLMs and LLMs struggle to distinguish investment actions
and conviction--the strength of belief conveyed through confident delivery and
detailed reasoning--often misclassifying general commentary as definitive
recommendations. While high-conviction recommendations perform better than
low-conviction ones, they still underperform the popular S\&P 500 index fund.
An inverse strategy--betting against finfluencer recommendations--outperforms
the S\&P 500 by 6.8\% in annual returns but carries greater risk (Sharpe ratio
of 0.41 vs. 0.65). Our benchmark enables a diverse evaluation of multimodal
tasks, comparing model performance on both full video and segmented video
inputs. This enables deeper advancements in multimodal financial research. Our
code, dataset, and evaluation leaderboard are available under the CC BY-NC 4.0

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图像和文本模态在表示上的固有差异（连续高维图像特征 vs. 离散结构化文本）带来的对齐挑战。

Method: 结合实例级对齐（融合视觉特征与VSD）和原型级对齐（VSD聚类），提升跨模态对齐能力。

Result: 在Flickr30K和MSCOCO上表现显著提升，并展示出零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效提升图像-文本匹配性能，并具有跨领域泛化潜力。

Abstract: Image-text matching (ITM) aims to address the fundamental challenge of
aligning visual and textual modalities, which inherently differ in their
representations, continuous, high-dimensional image features vs. discrete,
structured text. We propose a novel framework that bridges the modality gap by
leveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as visual semantic parsers.
By generating rich Visual Semantic Descriptions (VSD), MLLMs provide semantic
anchor that facilitate cross-modal alignment. Our approach combines: (1)
Instance-level alignment by fusing visual features with VSD to enhance the
linguistic expressiveness of image representations, and (2) Prototype-level
alignment through VSD clustering to ensure category-level consistency. These
modules can be seamlessly integrated into existing ITM models. Extensive
experiments on Flickr30K and MSCOCO demonstrate substantial performance
improvements. The approach also exhibits remarkable zero-shot generalization to
cross-domain tasks, including news and remote sensing ITM. The code and model
checkpoints are available at https://github.com/Image-Text-Matching/VSD.

Motivation: 在拥挤环境中，个体需要绕过其他个体到达目的地，研究如何通过噪声运动优化交通流，适用于机器人群体协调和密集人口基础设施设计。

Method: 结合模拟、理论和机器人实验，分析噪声对交通流的影响，并求解最优噪声水平和密度。

Result: 高于临界噪声水平时，大堵塞不会持续；提出了一种优化目标达成率的策略，并通过实验验证。

Conclusion: 简单的局部导航方案在中等密度下表现良好，计算效率远高于中央规划器，对实际问题有指导意义。

Abstract: In crowded environments, individuals must navigate around other occupants to
reach their destinations. Understanding and controlling traffic flows in these
spaces is relevant to coordinating robot swarms and designing infrastructure
for dense populations. Here, we combine simulations, theory, and robotic
experiments to study how noisy motion can disrupt traffic jams and enable flow
as agents travel to individual goals. Above a critical noise level, large jams
do not persist. From this observation, we analytically approximate the goal
attainment rate as a function of the noise level, then solve for the optimal
agent density and noise level that maximize the swarm's goal attainment rate.
We perform robotic experiments to corroborate our simulated and theoretical
results. Finally, we compare simple, local navigation approaches with a
sophisticated but computationally costly central planner. A simple reactive
scheme performs well up to moderate densities and is far more computationally
efficient than a planner, suggesting lessons for real-world problems.

Conclusion: 研究明确了哪种网络更适合实际应用，为移动机器人的避障导航提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Obstacle avoidance is crucial for mobile robots' navigation in both known and
unknown environments. This research designs, trains, and tests two custom
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), using color and depth images from a depth
camera as inputs. Both networks adopt sensor fusion to produce an output: the
mobile robot's angular velocity, which serves as the robot's steering command.
A newly obtained visual dataset for navigation was collected in diverse
environments with varying lighting conditions and dynamic obstacles. During
data collection, a communication link was established over Wi-Fi between a
remote server and the robot, using Robot Operating System (ROS) topics.
Velocity commands were transmitted from the server to the robot, enabling
synchronized recording of visual data and the corresponding steering commands.
Various evaluation metrics, such as Mean Squared Error, Variance Score, and
Feed-Forward time, provided a clear comparison between the two networks and
clarified which one to use for the application.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在机器人程序规划中缺乏低层次细节的问题，以及当前视觉语言模型依赖昂贵大规模模型或局限于狭窄模拟环境的问题。

Method: 通过自我批评、修订和验证的循环（受链式思维提示和自我指导范式启发），使小型视觉语言模型生成更高质量、可执行的计划。

Result: SelfReVision显著提升了小型模型的性能，甚至优于规模大100倍的模型，并在下游具体任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: SelfReVision为视觉语言模型提供了一种高效、可扩展的自我改进方法，适用于机器人程序规划。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in robotic procedural
planning, yet their human-centric reasoning often omits the low-level, grounded
details needed for robotic execution. Vision-language models (VLMs) offer a
path toward more perceptually grounded plans, but current methods either rely
on expensive, large-scale models or are constrained to narrow simulation
settings. We introduce SelfReVision, a lightweight and scalable
self-improvement framework for vision-language procedural planning.
SelfReVision enables small VLMs to iteratively critique, revise, and verify
their own plans-without external supervision or teacher models-drawing
inspiration from chain-of-thought prompting and self-instruct paradigms.
Through this self-distillation loop, models generate higher-quality,
execution-ready plans that can be used both at inference and for continued
fine-tuning. Using models varying from 3B to 72B, our results show that
SelfReVision not only boosts performance over weak base VLMs but also
outperforms models 100X the size, yielding improved control in downstream
embodied tasks.

Conclusion: CL3R通过增强3D感知和语义理解的结合，为机器人操作策略提供了更鲁棒的感知模块。

Abstract: Building a robust perception module is crucial for visuomotor policy
learning. While recent methods incorporate pre-trained 2D foundation models
into robotic perception modules to leverage their strong semantic
understanding, they struggle to capture 3D spatial information and generalize
across diverse camera viewpoints. These limitations hinder the policy's
effectiveness, especially in fine-grained robotic manipulation scenarios. To
address these challenges, we propose CL3R, a novel 3D pre-training framework
designed to enhance robotic manipulation policies. Our method integrates both
spatial awareness and semantic understanding by employing a point cloud Masked
Autoencoder to learn rich 3D representations while leveraging pre-trained 2D
foundation models through contrastive learning for efficient semantic knowledge
transfer. Additionally, we propose a 3D visual representation pre-training
framework for robotic tasks. By unifying coordinate systems across datasets and
introducing random fusion of multi-view point clouds, we mitigate camera view
ambiguity and improve generalization, enabling robust perception from novel
viewpoints at test time. Extensive experiments in both simulation and the real
world demonstrate the superiority of our method, highlighting its effectiveness
in visuomotor policy learning for robotic manipulation.

Abstract: Humanoid robots show significant potential in daily tasks. However,
reinforcement learning-based motion policies often suffer from robustness
degradation due to the sim-to-real dynamics gap, thereby affecting the agility
of real robots. In this work, we propose a novel robust adversarial training
paradigm designed to enhance the robustness of humanoid motion policies in real

precisely identifies vulnerabilities in motion policies and applies targeted
perturbations, forcing the motion policy to enhance its robustness against
perturbations through dynamic adversarial training. We conduct experiments on
the Unitree G1 humanoid robot for both perceptive locomotion and whole-body

enhances the robot's motion robustness in real world environments, enabling
successful traversal of challenging terrains and highly agile whole-body

Abstract: Accurate extrinsic calibration between multiple LiDAR sensors and a
GNSS-aided inertial navigation system (GINS) is essential for achieving
reliable sensor fusion in intelligent mining environments. Such calibration
enables vehicle-road collaboration by aligning perception data from
vehicle-mounted sensors to a unified global reference frame. However, existing
methods often depend on artificial targets, overlapping fields of view, or
precise trajectory estimation, which are assumptions that may not hold in
practice. Moreover, the planar motion of mining vehicles leads to observability
issues that degrade calibration performance. This paper presents a targetless
extrinsic calibration method that aligns multiple onboard LiDAR sensors to the
GINS coordinate system without requiring overlapping sensor views or external
targets. The proposed approach introduces an observation model based on the
known installation height of the GINS unit to constrain unobservable
calibration parameters under planar motion. A joint optimization framework is
developed to refine both the extrinsic parameters and GINS trajectory by
integrating multiple constraints derived from geometric correspondences and
motion consistency. The proposed method is applicable to heterogeneous LiDAR
configurations, including both mechanical and solid-state sensors. Extensive
experiments on simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate the accuracy,
robustness, and practical applicability of the approach under diverse sensor
setups.

Result: M3DGR数据集提供了系统化评估工具，Ground-Fusion++在复杂条件下表现出色。

Conclusion: 论文通过数据集和框架的贡献，提升了SLAM在复杂环境中的鲁棒性和适应性。

Abstract: Considerable advancements have been achieved in SLAM methods tailored for
structured environments, yet their robustness under challenging corner cases
remains a critical limitation. Although multi-sensor fusion approaches
integrating diverse sensors have shown promising performance improvements, the
research community faces two key barriers: On one hand, the lack of
standardized and configurable benchmarks that systematically evaluate SLAM
algorithms under diverse degradation scenarios hinders comprehensive
performance assessment. While on the other hand, existing SLAM frameworks
primarily focus on fusing a limited set of sensor types, without effectively
addressing adaptive sensor selection strategies for varying environmental
conditions.
  To bridge these gaps, we make three key contributions: First, we introduce
M3DGR dataset: a sensor-rich benchmark with systematically induced degradation
patterns including visual challenge, LiDAR degeneracy, wheel slippage and GNSS
denial. Second, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of forty SLAM systems on
M3DGR, providing critical insights into their robustness and limitations under
challenging real-world conditions. Third, we develop a resilient modular
multi-sensor fusion framework named Ground-Fusion++, which demonstrates robust
performance by coupling GNSS, RGB-D, LiDAR, IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) and
wheel odometry. Codes and datasets are publicly available.

Result: 实验表明，TD3-HD在姿态误差、角速度调节和故障条件下的稳定性方面显著优于PD控制器和其他DRL算法。

Conclusion: TD3-HD是一种强大的、具有容错能力的AI解决方案，适用于自主卫星姿态控制。

Abstract: Reliable satellite attitude control is essential for the success of space
missions, particularly as satellites increasingly operate autonomously in
dynamic and uncertain environments. Reaction wheels (RWs) play a pivotal role
in attitude control, and maintaining control resilience during RW faults is
critical to preserving mission objectives and system stability. However,
traditional Proportional Derivative (PD) controllers and existing deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms such as TD3, PPO, and A2C often fall
short in providing the real time adaptability and fault tolerance required for
autonomous satellite operations. This study introduces a DRL-based control
strategy designed to improve satellite resilience and adaptability under fault
conditions. Specifically, the proposed method integrates Twin Delayed Deep
Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) with Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) and
Dimension Wise Clipping (DWC) referred to as TD3-HD to enhance learning in
sparse reward environments and maintain satellite stability during RW failures.
The proposed approach is benchmarked against PD control and leading DRL
algorithms. Experimental results show that TD3-HD achieves significantly lower
attitude error, improved angular velocity regulation, and enhanced stability
under fault conditions. These findings underscore the proposed method potential
as a powerful, fault tolerant, onboard AI solution for autonomous satellite
attitude control.

Abstract: LiDAR-based 3D mapping suffers from cumulative drift causing global
misalignment, particularly in GNSS-constrained environments. To address this,
we propose a unified framework that fuses LiDAR, GNSS, and IMU data for
high-resolution city-scale mapping. The method performs velocity-based temporal
alignment using Dynamic Time Warping and refines GNSS and IMU signals via
extended Kalman filtering. Local maps are built using Normal Distributions
Transform-based registration and pose graph optimization with loop closure
detection, while global consistency is enforced using GNSS-constrained anchors
followed by fine registration of overlapping segments. We also introduce a
large-scale multimodal dataset captured in Perth, Western Australia to
facilitate future research in this direction. Our dataset comprises 144{,}000
frames acquired with a 128-channel Ouster LiDAR, synchronized RTK-GNSS
trajectories, and MEMS-IMU measurements across 21 urban loops. To assess
geometric consistency, we evaluated our method using alignment metrics based on
road centerlines and intersections to capture both global and local accuracy.
Our method reduces the average global alignment error from 3.32\,m to 1.24\,m,
achieving a 61.4\% improvement. The constructed high-fidelity map supports a
wide range of applications, including smart city planning, geospatial data
integration, infrastructure monitoring, and GPS-free navigation. Our method,
and dataset together establish a new benchmark for evaluating 3D city mapping
in GNSS-constrained environments. The dataset and code will be released
publicly.

Abstract: When inverse kinematics (IK) is adopted to control robotic arms in
manipulation tasks, there is often a discrepancy between the end effector (EE)
position of the robot model in the simulator and the physical EE in reality. In
most robotic scenarios with sim-to-real transfer, we have information about
joint positions in both simulation and reality, but the EE position is only
available in simulation. We developed a novel method to overcome this
difficulty based on haptic feedback calibration, using a touchscreen in front
of the robot that provides information on the EE position in the real
environment. During the calibration procedure, the robot touches specific
points on the screen, and the information is stored. In the next stage, we
build a transformation function from the data based on linear transformation
and neural networks that is capable of outputting all missing variables from
any partial input (simulated/real joint/EE position). Our results demonstrate
that a fully nonlinear neural network model performs best, significantly
reducing positioning errors.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于强化学习的框架，用于实现动态、速度感知的全身末端执行器控制，解决了运动与手臂动作之间的目标冲突问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 运动与手臂动作的目标冲突（如运动需要水平基座，而末端执行器跟踪可能需要基座倾斜），以及现有RL方法无法直接控制末端执行器速度的问题。

Method: 采用多评论家-演员架构，解耦运动与操作的奖励信号，并设计基于扭转的末端执行器任务公式。

Result: 通过仿真和硬件实验验证，控制器能同时行走和移动末端执行器，并展现出全身协作行为。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了任务冲突，实现了动态、速度感知的全身控制。

Abstract: Learning whole-body control for locomotion and arm motions in a single policy
has challenges, as the two tasks have conflicting goals. For instance,
efficient locomotion typically favors a horizontal base orientation, while
end-effector tracking may benefit from base tilting to extend reachability.
Additionally, current Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches using a pose-based
task specification lack the ability to directly control the end-effector
velocity, making smoothly executing trajectories very challenging. To address
these limitations, we propose an RL-based framework that allows for dynamic,
velocity-aware whole-body end-effector control. Our method introduces a
multi-critic actor architecture that decouples the reward signals for
locomotion and manipulation, simplifying reward tuning and allowing the policy
to resolve task conflicts more effectively. Furthermore, we design a
twist-based end-effector task formulation that can track both discrete poses
and motion trajectories. We validate our approach through a set of simulation
and hardware experiments using a quadruped robot equipped with a robotic arm.
The resulting controller can simultaneously walk and move its end-effector and
shows emergent whole-body behaviors, where the base assists the arm in
extending the workspace, despite a lack of explicit formulations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种仅从RGB图像学习机器人交接任务的方法，无需真实机器人训练或数据收集，通过稀疏视图高斯泼溅重建场景生成演示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从真实图像数据学习机器人操作策略时的高成本问题，以及仿真与真实环境间的视觉域差距。

Method: 利用稀疏视图高斯泼溅重建人类-机器人交接场景，生成图像-动作对演示，并直接训练机器人策略。

Result: 在16种家庭物品上训练的策略可直接部署到真实环境，实验证明其有效性。

Conclusion: H2RH-SGS为人类-机器人交接任务提供了一种新的有效表示方法。

Abstract: Learning robot manipulation policies from raw, real-world image data requires
a large number of robot-action trials in the physical environment. Although
training using simulations offers a cost-effective alternative, the visual
domain gap between simulation and robot workspace remains a major limitation.
Gaussian Splatting visual reconstruction methods have recently provided new
directions for robot manipulation by generating realistic environments. In this
paper, we propose the first method for learning supervised-based robot
handovers solely from RGB images without the need of real-robot training or
real-robot data collection. The proposed policy learner, Human-to-Robot
Handover using Sparse-View Gaussian Splatting (H2RH-SGS), leverages sparse-view
Gaussian Splatting reconstruction of human-to-robot handover scenes to generate
robot demonstrations containing image-action pairs captured with a camera
mounted on the robot gripper. As a result, the simulated camera pose changes in
the reconstructed scene can be directly translated into gripper pose changes.
We train a robot policy on demonstrations collected with 16 household objects
and {\em directly} deploy this policy in the real environment. Experiments in
both Gaussian Splatting reconstructed scene and real-world human-to-robot
handover experiments demonstrate that H2RH-SGS serves as a new and effective
representation for the human-to-robot handover task.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合统计和物理建模的RIR估计新方法，通过可解释参数分解RIR，并在噪声环境中优于传统解卷积方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖统计信号处理或深度神经网络，但结合统计和物理建模的RIR估计尚未充分探索。

Method: 将RIR分解为可解释参数（如高斯白噪声、频率相关指数衰减和自回归滤波器），并通过变分自由能成本函数估计参数。

Result: 在噪声环境中，该方法在干声和混响语音信号上优于传统解卷积方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为RIR估计提供了一种理论支持的新途径，尤其在噪声环境中表现优异。

Abstract: Room impulse response estimation is essential for tasks like speech
dereverberation, which improves automatic speech recognition. Most existing
methods rely on either statistical signal processing or deep neural networks
designed to replicate signal processing principles. However, combining
statistical and physical modeling for RIR estimation remains largely
unexplored. This paper proposes a novel approach integrating both aspects
through a theoretically grounded model. The RIR is decomposed into
interpretable parameters: white Gaussian noise filtered by a
frequency-dependent exponential decay (e.g. modeling wall absorption) and an
autoregressive filter (e.g. modeling microphone response). A variational
free-energy cost function enables practical parameter estimation. As a proof of
concept, we show that given dry and reverberant speech signals, the proposed
method outperforms classical deconvolution in noisy environments, as validated
by objective metrics.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在BirdCLEF+ 2025挑战中，如何在90分钟CPU推理限制下高效分类206种生物声音，提出了优化预训练模型和轻量级STSG管道的两种策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于BirdCLEF+ 2025挑战要求在90分钟CPU推理限制下分类206种生物声音，传统深度学习方法不适用，因此需要探索高效解决方案。

Method: 1. 优化Bioacoustics Model Zoo中的预训练模型，使用TFLite加速推理；2. 提出轻量级STSG管道，将音频转换为离散频谱标记并学习上下文嵌入。

Result: 优化后的Perch模型在16分钟内完成推理，ROC-AUC得分为0.729（公开）和0.711（私有）；STSG管道在6分钟内完成推理，得分为0.559（公开）和0.520（私有）。

Conclusion: 优化预训练模型和STSG管道均能在严格时间限制下实现高效分类，证明了轻量化和快速方法的可行性。

Abstract: The BirdCLEF+ 2025 challenge requires classifying 206 species, including
birds, mammals, insects, and amphibians, from soundscape recordings under a
strict 90-minute CPU-only inference deadline, making many state-of-the-art deep
learning approaches impractical. To address this constraint, the DS@GT BirdCLEF
team explored two strategies. First, we establish competitive baselines by
optimizing pre-trained models from the Bioacoustics Model Zoo for CPU
inference. Using TFLite, we achieved a nearly 10x inference speedup for the
Perch model, enabling it to run in approximately 16 minutes and achieve a final
ROC-AUC score of 0.729 on the public leaderboard post-competition and 0.711 on
the private leaderboard. The best model from the zoo was BirdSetEfficientNetB1,
with a public score of 0.810 and a private score of 0.778. Second, we introduce
a novel, lightweight pipeline named Spectrogram Token Skip-Gram (STSG) that
treats bioacoustics as a sequence modeling task. This method converts audio
into discrete "spectrogram tokens" by clustering Mel-spectrograms using Faiss
K-means and then learns high-quality contextual embeddings for these tokens in
an unsupervised manner with a Word2Vec skip-gram model. For classification,
embeddings within a 5-second window are averaged and passed to a linear model.
With a projected inference time of 6 minutes for a 700-minute test set, the
STSG approach achieved a final ROC-AUC public score of 0.559 and a private
score of 0.520, demonstrating the viability of fast tokenization approaches
with static embeddings for bioacoustic classification. Supporting code for this

Motivation: 解决大规模数据存储约束问题，提升语料库构建效率。

Method: 基于主动学习，迭代进行数据收集和模型训练，专注于获取对模型改进更有价值的数据。

Result: 实验表明，相同规模下，该方法构建的语料库能实现更高质量的语音合成。

Conclusion: 该方法能高效构建高质量TTS语料库，优于传统方法。

Abstract: The construction of high-quality datasets is a cornerstone of modern
text-to-speech (TTS) systems. However, the increasing scale of available data
poses significant challenges, including storage constraints. To address these
issues, we propose a TTS corpus construction method based on active learning.
Unlike traditional feed-forward and model-agnostic corpus construction
approaches, our method iteratively alternates between data collection and model
training, thereby focusing on acquiring data that is more informative for model
improvement. This approach enables the construction of a data-efficient corpus.
Experimental results demonstrate that the corpus constructed using our method
enables higher-quality speech synthesis than corpora of the same size.

Motivation: 现有音频修复方法在缺失段超过100毫秒时质量下降，需改进长缺失段的修复效果。

Method: 使用预训练音频标记器生成离散标记，通过离散扩散模型直接在潜在空间建模生成过程。

Result: 在MusicNet（300毫秒）和MTG（500毫秒）数据集上，客观和感知指标均优于基线。

Conclusion: 该方法为长缺失段音频修复提供了稳定且语义连贯的解决方案。

Abstract: Audio inpainting refers to the task of reconstructing missing segments in
corrupted audio recordings. While prior approaches-including waveform and
spectrogram-based diffusion models-have shown promising results for short gaps,
they often degrade in quality when gaps exceed 100 milliseconds (ms). In this
work, we introduce a novel inpainting method based on discrete diffusion
modeling, which operates over tokenized audio representations produced by a
pre-trained audio tokenizer. Our approach models the generative process
directly in the discrete latent space, enabling stable and semantically
coherent reconstruction of missing audio. We evaluate the method on the
MusicNet dataset using both objective and perceptual metrics across gap
durations up to 300 ms. We further evaluated our approach on the MTG dataset,
extending the gap duration to 500 ms. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method achieves competitive or superior performance compared to existing
baselines, particularly for longer gaps, offering a robust solution for
restoring degraded musical recordings. Audio examples of our proposed method

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过反转波形片段和语音分离技术来保护环境录音中语音隐私的方法，同时保持音频质量和声学场景完整性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 环境录音中常包含可理解的语音，引发隐私问题，限制了数据的分析、共享和重用。

Method: 采用波形片段反转和语音分离技术，结合语音活动检测，精准破坏语音内容。

Result: 方法显著降低语音可懂度（97.9% WER），对声源检测影响小（2.7% SCAD），音频质量高（FAD 1.40）。

Conclusion: 该方法有效保护语音隐私，同时保持环境录音的实用性和音频质量。

Abstract: Environmental sound recordings often contain intelligible speech, raising
privacy concerns that limit analysis, sharing and reuse of data. In this paper,
we introduce a method that renders speech unintelligible while preserving both
the integrity of the acoustic scene, and the overall audio quality. Our
approach involves reversing waveform segments to distort speech content. This
process is enhanced through a voice activity detection and speech separation
pipeline, which allows for more precise targeting of speech.
  In order to demonstrate the effectivness of the proposed approach, we
consider a three-part evaluation protocol that assesses: 1) speech
intelligibility using Word Error Rate (WER), 2) sound sources detectability
using Sound source Classification Accuracy-Drop (SCAD) from a widely used
pre-trained model, and 3) audio quality using the Fr\'echet Audio Distance
(FAD), computed with our reference dataset that contains unaltered speech.
Experiments on this simulated evaluation dataset, which consists of linear
mixtures of speech and environmental sound scenes, show that our method
achieves satisfactory speech intelligibility reduction (97.9% WER), minimal
degradation of the sound sources detectability (2.7% SCAD), and high perceptual
quality (FAD of 1.40). An ablation study further highlights the contribution of
each component of the pipeline. We also show that incorporating random splicing
to our speech content privacy enforcement method can enhance the algorithm's
robustness to attempt to recover the clean speech, at a slight cost of audio
quality.

TL;DR: MIDI-VALLE是一种基于VALLE框架的神经编解码语言模型，用于从MIDI生成高质量音频表演，显著优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统音乐表演合成模型在多样化的MIDI来源、音乐风格和录音环境中泛化能力不足。

Method: 改进VALLE框架，引入参考音频和MIDI作为条件输入，将MIDI和音频编码为离散标记。

Result: 在ATEPP和Maestro数据集上，Frechet Audio Distance降低75%以上，听众测试中表现显著优于基线。

Conclusion: MIDI-VALLE在音乐表演合成中表现出更高的质量和泛化能力。

Abstract: Generating expressive audio performances from music scores requires models to
capture both instrument acoustics and human interpretation. Traditional music
performance synthesis pipelines follow a two-stage approach, first generating
expressive performance MIDI from a score, then synthesising the MIDI into
audio. However, the synthesis models often struggle to generalise across
diverse MIDI sources, musical styles, and recording environments. To address
these challenges, we propose MIDI-VALLE, a neural codec language model adapted
from the VALLE framework, which was originally designed for zero-shot
personalised text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis. For performance MIDI-to-audio
synthesis, we improve the architecture to condition on a reference audio
performance and its corresponding MIDI. Unlike previous TTS-based systems that
rely on piano rolls, MIDI-VALLE encodes both MIDI and audio as discrete tokens,
facilitating a more consistent and robust modelling of piano performances.
Furthermore, the model's generalisation ability is enhanced by training on an
extensive and diverse piano performance dataset. Evaluation results show that
MIDI-VALLE significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline, achieving
over 75% lower Frechet Audio Distance on the ATEPP and Maestro datasets. In the
listening test, MIDI-VALLE received 202 votes compared to 58 for the baseline,
demonstrating improved synthesis quality and generalisation across diverse
performance MIDI inputs.

Motivation: 现有T2A方法因音频-文本对齐数据有限，难以处理复杂时序控制提示。

Result: FreeAudio在无需训练方法中达到最优时序控制T2A生成质量，与训练方法相当。

Conclusion: FreeAudio为时序控制长文本T2A合成开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Text-to-audio (T2A) generation has achieved promising results with the recent
advances in generative models. However, because of the limited quality and
quantity of temporally-aligned audio-text pairs, existing T2A methods struggle
to handle the complex text prompts that contain precise timing control, e.g.,
"owl hooted at 2.4s-5.2s". Recent works have explored data augmentation
techniques or introduced timing conditions as model inputs to enable
timing-conditioned 10-second T2A generation, while their synthesis quality is
still limited. In this work, we propose a novel training-free timing-controlled
T2A framework, FreeAudio, making the first attempt to enable timing-controlled
long-form T2A generation, e.g., "owl hooted at 2.4s-5.2s and crickets chirping
at 0s-24s". Specifically, we first employ an LLM to plan non-overlapping time
windows and recaption each with a refined natural language description, based
on the input text and timing prompts. Then we introduce: 1) Decoupling and
Aggregating Attention Control for precise timing control; 2) Contextual Latent
Composition for local smoothness and Reference Guidance for global consistency.
Extensive experiments show that: 1) FreeAudio achieves state-of-the-art
timing-conditioned T2A synthesis quality among training-free methods and is
comparable to leading training-based methods; 2) FreeAudio demonstrates
comparable long-form generation quality with training-based Stable Audio and
paves the way for timing-controlled long-form T2A synthesis. Demo samples are

Result: 方法在保持与传统方法相当准确度的同时，提供了更高的鲁棒性和可解释性。

Conclusion: 通过音素分析，为可解释的说话者中心化深度伪造检测开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI have made the creation of speech deepfakes
widely accessible, posing serious challenges to digital trust. To counter this,
various speech deepfake detection strategies have been proposed, including
Person-of-Interest (POI) approaches, which focus on identifying impersonations
of specific individuals by modeling and analyzing their unique vocal traits.
Despite their excellent performance, the existing methods offer limited
granularity and lack interpretability. In this work, we propose a POI-based
speech deepfake detection method that operates at the phoneme level. Our
approach decomposes reference audio into phonemes to construct a detailed
speaker profile. In inference, phonemes from a test sample are individually
compared against this profile, enabling fine-grained detection of synthetic
artifacts. The proposed method achieves comparable accuracy to traditional
approaches while offering superior robustness and interpretability, key aspects
in multimedia forensics. By focusing on phoneme analysis, this work explores a
novel direction for explainable, speaker-centric deepfake detection.

remain a fragile component of speech processing pipelines that is prone to
biases related to the channel, age, and language. Issues which will need to be

0.90 accuracy in cross-validation and 0.88 externally. SHAP analysis revealed
enhanced feature discriminability in both SSL and SL, especially for Class 1
survival greater than 4 years. SSL showed strong performance with only 10
percent labeled data, with more stable results compared to SL and lower
variance across external testing, highlighting SSL's robustness and cost
effectiveness.
  Conclusion: We introduced a cost-effective, stable, and interpretable SSL
framework for CT-based survival prediction in lung cancer, improving
performance, generalizability, and clinical readiness by integrating SHAP
explainability and leveraging unlabeled data.

Abstract: This paper develops a neural jamming phase diagram that interprets the
emergence of consciousness in large language models as a critical phenomenon in
high-dimensional disordered systems.By establishing analogies with jamming
transitions in granular matter and other complex systems, we identify three
fundamental control parameters governing the phase behavior of neural networks:
temperature, volume fraction, and stress.The theory provides a unified physical
explanation for empirical scaling laws in artificial intelligence,
demonstrating how computational cooling, density optimization, and noise
reduction collectively drive systems toward a critical jamming surface where
generalized intelligence emerges. Remarkably, the same thermodynamic principles
that describe conventional jamming transitions appear to underlie the emergence
of consciousness in neural networks, evidenced by shared critical signatures
including divergent correlation lengths and scaling exponents.Our work explains
neural language models' critical scaling through jamming physics, suggesting
consciousness is a jamming phase that intrinsically connects knowledge
components via long-range correlations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床图像中伤口和比例标记的精确分割对伤口管理和自动化评估至关重要，但现有方法面临类别不平衡和图像变异性的挑战。

Method: 采用双注意力U-Net++架构，结合通道（SCSE）和空间注意力机制，使用EfficientNet-B7作为编码器，通过独立训练两个类特定模型、数据增强和贝叶斯超参数优化，最终集成模型并利用测试时间增强提升预测可靠性。

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂医学分割任务中表现出色，验证了双注意力机制和集成策略的有效性。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of wounds and scale markers in clinical images remainsa
significant challenge, crucial for effective wound management and
automatedassessment. In this study, we propose a novel dual-attention U-Net++
archi-tecture, integrating channel-wise (SCSE) and spatial attention mechanisms
toaddress severe class imbalance and variability in medical images
effectively.Initially, extensive benchmarking across diverse architectures and
encoders via 5-fold cross-validation identified EfficientNet-B7 as the optimal
encoder backbone.Subsequently, we independently trained two class-specific
models with tailoredpreprocessing, extensive data augmentation, and Bayesian
hyperparameter tun-ing (WandB sweeps). The final model ensemble utilized Test
Time Augmentationto further enhance prediction reliability. Our approach was
evaluated on a bench-mark dataset from the NBC 2025 & PCBBE 2025 competition.
Segmentationperformance was quantified using a weighted F1-score (75% wounds,
25% scalemarkers), calculated externally by competition organizers on
undisclosed hard-ware. The proposed approach achieved an F1-score of 0.8640,
underscoring itseffectiveness for complex medical segmentation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统森林资源调查方法耗时耗力，多光谱LiDAR技术能同时获取空间和光谱信息，为森林成分分割提供高效解决方案。

Method: 研究使用HeliALS系统获取高密度多光谱点云数据，并比较了三种点云深度学习模型和一种机器学习模型（KPConv、Superpoint Transformer、Point Transformer V3和随机森林）。

Result: KPConv模型表现最佳，结合所有波长数据时，mIoU和mAcc分别提升了33.73%和32.35%。

Conclusion: 多光谱LiDAR技术在自动化森林成分分割中具有巨大潜力，显著提高了分割精度。

Abstract: Conservation and decision-making regarding forest resources necessitate
regular forest inventory. Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) in laser scanning
systems has gained significant attention over the past two decades as a remote
and non-destructive solution to streamline the labor-intensive and
time-consuming procedure of forest inventory. Advanced multispectral (MS) LiDAR
systems simultaneously acquire three-dimensional (3D) spatial and spectral
information across multiple wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum.
Consequently, MS-LiDAR technology enables the estimation of both the
biochemical and biophysical characteristics of forests. Forest component
segmentation is crucial for forest inventory. The synergistic use of spatial
and spectral laser information has proven to be beneficial for achieving
precise forest semantic segmentation. Thus, this study aims to investigate the
potential of MS-LiDAR data, captured by the HeliALS system, providing
high-density multispectral point clouds to segment forests into six components:
ground, low vegetation, trunks, branches, foliage, and woody debris. Three
point-wise 3D deep learning models and one machine learning model, including
kernel point convolution, superpoint transformer, point transformer V3, and
random forest, are implemented. Our experiments confirm the superior accuracy
of the KPConv model. Additionally, various geometric and spectral feature
vector scenarios are examined. The highest accuracy is achieved by feeding all
three wavelengths (1550 nm, 905 nm, and 532 nm) as the initial features into
the deep learning model, resulting in improvements of 33.73% and 32.35% in mean
intersection over union (mIoU) and in mean accuracy (mAcc), respectively. This
study highlights the excellent potential of multispectral LiDAR for improving
the accuracy in fully automated forest component segmentation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于实例拼图任务的新型MIL方法，通过恢复实例的顺序来捕捉WSI中的语义相关性，优于现有MIL方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MIL方法依赖置换不变性，限制了其在WSI分析中捕捉实例间语义相关性的能力。

Method: 提出学习从随机打乱的实例中恢复顺序的任务（实例拼图问题），并设计了一种基于Siamese网络的解决方案，理论依据为最优传输理论。

Result: 在WSI分类和生存预测任务中，该方法优于当前最先进的MIL方法。

Conclusion: 通过实例拼图任务捕捉空间相关性，为WSI分析提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: While multiple instance learning (MIL) has shown to be a promising approach
for histopathological whole slide image (WSI) analysis, its reliance on
permutation invariance significantly limits its capacity to effectively uncover
semantic correlations between instances within WSIs. Based on our empirical and
theoretical investigations, we argue that approaches that are not
permutation-invariant but better capture spatial correlations between instances
can offer more effective solutions. In light of these findings, we propose a
novel alternative to existing MIL for WSI analysis by learning to restore the
order of instances from their randomly shuffled arrangement. We term this task
as cracking an instance jigsaw puzzle problem, where semantic correlations
between instances are uncovered. To tackle the instance jigsaw puzzles, we
propose a novel Siamese network solution, which is theoretically justified by
optimal transport theory. We validate the proposed method on WSI classification
and survival prediction tasks, where the proposed method outperforms the recent
state-of-the-art MIL competitors. The code is available at

### [243] [Depth-Sequence Transformer (DST) for Segment-Specific ICA Calcification Mapping on Non-Contrast CT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08214)
*Xiangjian Hou,Ebru Yaman Akcicek,Xin Wang,Kazem Hashemizadeh,Scott Mcnally,Chun Yuan,Xiaodong Ma*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Depth-Sequence Transformer (DST)的新方法，用于解决颅内颈动脉钙化(ICAC)的细粒度分段量化问题，通过并行概率地标定位任务实现了高精度和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ICAC总体积指标忽略了钙化位置的关键影响，而传统3D模型无法实现细粒度的分段量化。

Method: 将3D问题重新定义为1D轴向的并行概率地标定位任务，提出DST框架处理全分辨率CT体积，预测6个独立概率分布以定位关键解剖标志。

Result: 在100名患者的临床队列中，5折交叉验证显示平均绝对误差为0.1切片，96%预测在±1切片范围内；在Clean-CC-CCII基准测试中表现最佳。

Conclusion: DST是首个实用的自动化分段ICAC分析工具，为研究位置特异性生物标志物在诊断、预后和手术规划中的作用奠定了基础。

Abstract: While total intracranial carotid artery calcification (ICAC) volume is an
established stroke biomarker, growing evidence shows this aggregate metric
ignores the critical influence of plaque location, since calcification in
different segments carries distinct prognostic and procedural risks. However, a
finer-grained, segment-specific quantification has remained technically
infeasible. Conventional 3D models are forced to process downsampled volumes or
isolated patches, sacrificing the global context required to resolve anatomical
ambiguity and render reliable landmark localization. To overcome this, we
reformulate the 3D challenge as a \textbf{Parallel Probabilistic Landmark
Localization} task along the 1D axial dimension. We propose the
\textbf{Depth-Sequence Transformer (DST)}, a framework that processes
full-resolution CT volumes as sequences of 2D slices, learning to predict $N=6$
independent probability distributions that pinpoint key anatomical landmarks.
Our DST framework demonstrates exceptional accuracy and robustness. Evaluated
on a 100-patient clinical cohort with rigorous 5-fold cross-validation, it
achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of \textbf{0.1 slices}, with \textbf{96\%}
of predictions falling within a $\pm1$ slice tolerance. Furthermore, to
validate its architectural power, the DST backbone establishes the best result
on the public Clean-CC-CCII classification benchmark under an end-to-end
evaluation protocol. Our work delivers the first practical tool for automated
segment-specific ICAC analysis. The proposed framework provides a foundation
for further studies on the role of location-specific biomarkers in diagnosis,
prognosis, and procedural planning. Our code will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: Raptor是一种无需训练的方法，通过随机平面张量压缩生成体积数据的语义丰富嵌入，显著降低计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决体积成像数据（如MRI）训练高维模型的计算复杂性和数据不足问题。

Method: 利用预训练的2D基础模型提取医学体积数据的视觉标记，并通过随机投影进行空间压缩。

Result: 在十项医学体积任务中表现优于现有方法（提升3%-14%），且无需训练。

Conclusion: Raptor为医学体积数据的深度学习提供了高效且通用的基础。

Abstract: Current challenges in developing foundational models for volumetric imaging
data, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), stem from the computational
complexity of training state-of-the-art architectures in high dimensions and
curating sufficiently large datasets of volumes. To address these challenges,
we introduce Raptor (Random Planar Tensor Reduction), a train-free method for
generating semantically rich embeddings for volumetric data. Raptor leverages a
frozen 2D foundation model, pretrained on natural images, to extract visual
tokens from individual cross-sections of medical volumes. These tokens are then
spatially compressed using random projections, significantly reducing
computational complexity while retaining semantic information. Extensive
experiments on ten diverse medical volume tasks verify the superior performance
of Raptor over state-of-the-art methods, including those pretrained exclusively
on medical volumes (+3% SuPreM, +6% MISFM, +10% Merlin, +13% VoCo, and +14%
SLIViT), while entirely bypassing the need for costly training. Our results
highlight the effectiveness and versatility of Raptor as a foundation for
advancing deep learning-based methods for medical volumes.

TL;DR: AmpLyze是一种预测抗菌肽（AMP）溶血毒性（HC50）的模型，通过序列分析提供定量预测和解释性结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型仅能定性判断AMP的毒性（有毒或无毒），无法提供定量预测和解释性分析，限制了AMP的设计和安全性评估。

Method: AmpLyze结合了残基级的ProtT5/ESM2嵌入和序列级描述符，通过双分支结构（局部和全局）和交叉注意力模块进行训练，使用log-cosh损失函数以减少实验噪声的影响。

Result: AmpLyze的PCC为0.756，MSE为0.987，优于传统回归器和现有最佳模型。交叉注意力模块进一步提升了性能。

Conclusion: AmpLyze将溶血评估转化为定量、基于序列且可解释的预测，为AMP设计和早期毒性筛查提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Red-blood-cell lysis (HC50) is the principal safety barrier for
antimicrobial-peptide (AMP) therapeutics, yet existing models only say "toxic"
or "non-toxic." AmpLyze closes this gap by predicting the actual HC50 value
from sequence alone and explaining the residues that drive toxicity. The model
couples residue-level ProtT5/ESM2 embeddings with sequence-level descriptors in
dual local and global branches, aligned by a cross-attention module and trained
with log-cosh loss for robustness to assay noise. The optimal AmpLyze model
reaches a PCC of 0.756 and an MSE of 0.987, outperforming classical regressors
and the state-of-the-art. Ablations confirm that both branches are essential,
and cross-attention adds a further 1% PCC and 3% MSE improvement.
Expected-Gradients attributions reveal known toxicity hotspots and suggest
safer substitutions. By turning hemolysis assessment into a quantitative,
sequence-based, and interpretable prediction, AmpLyze facilitates AMP design
and offers a practical tool for early-stage toxicity screening.

Abstract: There is an imperative need to provide quality of life to a growing
population of older adults living independently. Personalised solutions that
focus on the person and take into consideration their preferences and context
are key. In this work, we introduce a framework for representing and reasoning
about the Activities of Daily Living of older adults living independently at

that aggregates semi-structured interviews, home layouts and sociological
observations from the participants. We use these data to create formal models,
personalised for each participant according to their preferences and context.
We formulate requirements that are specific to each individual as properties
encoded in Linear Temporal Logic and use a model checker to verify whether each
property is satisfied by the model. When a property is violated, a
counterexample is generated giving the cause of the violation. We demonstrate
the framework's generalisability by applying it to different participants,
highlighting its potential to enhance the safety and well-being of older adults

Result: 在五个真实数据集上验证，EP-GAT在多种指标上优于五种基线方法。

Conclusion: EP-GAT通过动态建模和分层特征保留，显著提升了股票预测的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Graph neural networks have shown remarkable performance in forecasting stock
movements, which arises from learning complex inter-dependencies between stocks
and intra-dynamics of stocks. Existing approaches based on graph neural
networks typically rely on static or manually defined factors to model changing
inter-dependencies between stocks. Furthermore, these works often struggle to
preserve hierarchical features within stocks. To bridge these gaps, this work
presents the Energy-based Parallel Graph Attention Neural Network, a novel
approach for predicting future movements for multiple stocks. First, it
generates a dynamic stock graph with the energy difference between stocks and
Boltzmann distribution, capturing evolving inter-dependencies between stocks.
Then, a parallel graph attention mechanism is proposed to preserve the
hierarchical intra-stock dynamics. Extensive experiments on five real-world
datasets are conducted to validate the proposed approach, spanning from the US
stock markets (NASDAQ, NYSE, SP) and UK stock markets (FTSE, LSE). The
experimental results demonstrate that EP-GAT consistently outperforms
competitive five baselines on test periods across various metrics. The ablation
studies and hyperparameter sensitivity analysis further validate the
effectiveness of each module in the proposed method.

Motivation: 现有盲估计方法在实际应用中精度不足，需要一种更有效的解决方案。

Result: 实验表明，DARAS在主观和客观评估中均显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: DARAS为实际环境中的盲RIR估计提供了鲁棒且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Room Impulse Responses (RIRs) accurately characterize acoustic properties of
indoor environments and play a crucial role in applications such as speech
enhancement, speech recognition, and audio rendering in augmented reality (AR)
and virtual reality (VR). Existing blind estimation methods struggle to achieve
practical accuracy. To overcome this challenge, we propose the dynamic
audio-room acoustic synthesis (DARAS) model, a novel deep learning framework
that is explicitly designed for blind RIR estimation from monaural reverberant
speech signals. First, a dedicated deep audio encoder effectively extracts
relevant nonlinear latent space features. Second, the Mamba-based
self-supervised blind room parameter estimation (MASS-BRPE) module, utilizing
the efficient Mamba state space model (SSM), accurately estimates key room
acoustic parameters and features. Third, the system incorporates a hybrid-path
cross-attention feature fusion module, enhancing deep integration between audio
and room acoustic features. Finally, our proposed dynamic acoustic tuning (DAT)
decoder adaptively segments early reflections and late reverberation to improve
the realism of synthesized RIRs. Experimental results, including a MUSHRA-based
subjective listening study, demonstrate that DARAS substantially outperforms
existing baseline models, providing a robust and effective solution for
practical blind RIR estimation in real-world acoustic environments.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种广义的Mallows模型，通过学习数据中的距离度量来适应不同场景的排名数据，并开发了高效的采样和最大似然估计算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要使用固定距离度量（如Kendall's τ距离），缺乏从数据中学习距离度量的方法。实际中，排名因上下文而异，需要更灵活的模型。

Method: 提出广义Mallows模型，使用Lα距离度量，开发FPTAS采样算法和MLE算法，联合估计中心排名、分散参数和最优距离度量。

Result: 证明了估计器的强一致性，并在体育排名数据集上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 广义Mallows模型能更灵活地适应不同场景的排名数据，且算法高效可靠。

Abstract: \textit{Mallows model} is a widely-used probabilistic framework for learning
from ranking data, with applications ranging from recommendation systems and
voting to aligning language models with human
preferences~\cite{chen2024mallows, kleinberg2021algorithmic,
rafailov2024direct}. Under this model, observed rankings are noisy
perturbations of a central ranking $\sigma$, with likelihood decaying
exponentially in distance from $\sigma$, i.e, $P (\pi) \propto \exp\big(-\beta
\cdot d(\pi, \sigma)\big),$ where $\beta > 0$ controls dispersion and $d$ is a
distance function.
  Existing methods mainly focus on fixed distances (such as Kendall's $\tau$
distance), with no principled approach to learning the distance metric directly
from data. In practice, however, rankings naturally vary by context; for
instance, in some sports we regularly see long-range swaps (a low-rank team
beating a high-rank one), while in others such events are rare. Motivated by
this, we propose a generalization of Mallows model that learns the distance
metric directly from data. Specifically, we focus on $L_\alpha$ distances:
$d_\alpha(\pi,\sigma):=\sum_{i=1} |\pi(i)-\sigma(i)|^\alpha$.
  For any $\alpha\geq 1$ and $\beta>0$, we develop a Fully Polynomial-Time
Approximation Scheme (FPTAS) to efficiently generate samples that are
$\epsilon$- close (in total variation distance) to the true distribution. Even
in the special cases of $L_1$ and $L_2$, this generalizes prior results that
required vanishing dispersion ($\beta\to0$). Using this sampling algorithm, we
propose an efficient Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) algorithm that jointly
estimates the central ranking, the dispersion parameter, and the optimal
distance metric. We prove strong consistency results for our estimators (for
any values of $\alpha$ and $\beta$), and we validate our approach empirically
using datasets from sports rankings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常只单独处理随机或认知不确定性，而CLEAR旨在平衡两者以提高条件覆盖。

Method: CLEAR使用两个参数γ₁和γ₂，结合随机和认知不确定性估计器，如分位数回归和PCS框架的集成。

Result: 在17个数据集上，CLEAR平均将区间宽度减少了28.2%和17.4%，同时保持名义覆盖。

Conclusion: CLEAR在随机或认知不确定性主导的场景中表现优异，显著提升了预测建模的可靠性。

Abstract: Accurate uncertainty quantification is critical for reliable predictive
modeling, especially in regression tasks. Existing methods typically address
either aleatoric uncertainty from measurement noise or epistemic uncertainty
from limited data, but not necessarily both in a balanced way. We propose
CLEAR, a calibration method with two distinct parameters, $\gamma_1$ and
$\gamma_2$, to combine the two uncertainty components for improved conditional
coverage. CLEAR is compatible with any pair of aleatoric and epistemic
estimators; we show how it can be used with (i) quantile regression for
aleatoric uncertainty and (ii) ensembles drawn from the
Predictability-Computability-Stability (PCS) framework for epistemic
uncertainty. Across 17 diverse real-world datasets, CLEAR achieves an average
improvement of 28.2% and 17.4% in the interval width compared to the two
individually calibrated baselines while maintaining nominal coverage. This
improvement can be particularly evident in scenarios dominated by either high
epistemic or high aleatoric uncertainty.

Conclusion: Stein收缩估计显著提升了BN在对抗攻击下的鲁棒性，适用于多种深度学习任务。

Abstract: Batch normalization (BN) is a ubiquitous operation in deep neural networks
used primarily to achieve stability and regularization during network training.
BN involves feature map centering and scaling using sample means and variances,
respectively. Since these statistics are being estimated across the feature
maps within a batch, this problem is ideally suited for the application of
Stein's shrinkage estimation, which leads to a better, in the
mean-squared-error sense, estimate of the mean and variance of the batch. In
this paper, we prove that the Stein shrinkage estimator for the mean and
variance dominates over the sample mean and variance estimators in the presence
of adversarial attacks when modeling these attacks using sub-Gaussian
distributions. This facilitates and justifies the application of Stein
shrinkage to estimate the mean and variance parameters in BN and use it in
image classification (segmentation) tasks with and without adversarial attacks.
We present SOTA performance results using this Stein corrected batch norm in a
standard ResNet architecture applied to the task of image classification using
CIFAR-10 data, 3D CNN on PPMI (neuroimaging) data and image segmentation using
HRNet on Cityscape data with and without adversarial attacks.

### [255] [MIRRAMS: Towards Training Models Robust to Missingness Distribution Shifts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08280)
*Jihye Lee,Minseo Kang,Dongha Kim*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为MIRRAMS的深度学习框架，通过互信息条件增强模型对缺失数据分布变化的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决训练和测试数据中缺失分布不一致的问题，提升预测模型的鲁棒性。

Method: 引入互信息条件（MI robustness conditions），设计损失函数MIRRAMS，确保模型对缺失模式不变性。

Result: 在多种基准数据集上表现优于现有方法，且在不缺失数据时也能达到最优性能。

Conclusion: MIRRAMS是一个通用且强大的学习框架，适用于半监督学习任务。

Abstract: In real-world data analysis, missingness distributional shifts between
training and test input datasets frequently occur, posing a significant
challenge to achieving robust prediction performance. In this study, we propose
a novel deep learning framework designed to address such shifts in missingness
distributions. We begin by introducing a set of mutual information-based
conditions, called MI robustness conditions, which guide a prediction model to
extract label-relevant information while remaining invariant to diverse
missingness patterns, thereby enhancing robustness to unseen missingness
scenarios at test-time. To make these conditions practical, we propose simple
yet effective techniques to derive loss terms corresponding to each and
formulate a final objective function, termed MIRRAMS(Mutual Information
Regularization for Robustness Against Missingness Shifts). As a by-product, our
analysis provides a theoretical interpretation of the principles underlying
consistency regularization-based semi-supervised learning methods, such as
FixMatch. Extensive experiments across various benchmark datasets show that
MIRRAMS consistently outperforms existing baselines and maintains stable
performance across diverse missingness scenarios. Moreover, our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance even without missing data and can be
naturally extended to address semi-supervised learning tasks, highlighting
MIRRAMS as a powerful, off-the-shelf framework for general-purpose learning.

*Sanghoon Yu,Min-hwan Oh*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为BLAE的新算法，用于解决批处理线性老虎机问题，首次在所有情况下实现了极小极大最优后悔，同时计算开销低且实际表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在理论上可以达到接近最优的后悔，但计算成本高或实际表现不佳，因此需要一种既能保证理论最优又实用的算法。

Method: BLAE算法结合了臂消除和正则化G-最优设计，仅需O(log log T)批次即可实现最优后悔。

Result: BLAE在理论和实验中均表现出色，首次在所有情况下实现了极小极大最优后悔，并在数值评估中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: BLAE是首个在所有情况下兼具理论最优性和实际优越性的批处理线性老虎机算法。

Abstract: We study the linear bandit problem under limited adaptivity, known as the
batched linear bandit. While existing approaches can achieve near-optimal
regret in theory, they are often computationally prohibitive or underperform in
practice. We propose \texttt{BLAE}, a novel batched algorithm that integrates
arm elimination with regularized G-optimal design, achieving the minimax
optimal regret (up to logarithmic factors in $T$) in both large-$K$ and
small-$K$ regimes for the first time, while using only $O(\log\log T)$ batches.
Our analysis introduces new techniques for batch-wise optimal design and
refined concentration bounds. Crucially, \texttt{BLAE} demonstrates low
computational overhead and strong empirical performance, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods in extensive numerical evaluations. Thus,
\texttt{BLAE} is the first algorithm to combine provable minimax-optimality in
all regimes and practical superiority in batched linear bandits.

### [257] [Data Depth as a Risk](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08518)
*Arturo Castellanos,Pavlo Mozharovskyi*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于分类器损失的“损失深度”框架，扩展了半空间深度的概念，适用于高维数据，并展示了其在异常检测中的高效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据深度在无监督学习中用于量化点的中心性，但现有方法如半空间深度在高维场景下存在局限性。本文旨在通过分类器损失的视角重新定义数据深度，以提升其在高维数据中的适用性和计算效率。

Method: 通过将半空间深度视为一组分类器的最小损失，提出了“损失深度”框架。该框架支持多种分类器（如SVM、逻辑回归），并利用其高效算法和统计收敛性。

Result: 实验表明，损失深度不仅易于解释，还能高效地应用于高维数据的异常检测。

Conclusion: 损失深度框架为数据深度提供了新的视角，适用于高维数据，并展示了其在异常检测中的潜力。

Abstract: Data depths are score functions that quantify in an unsupervised fashion how
central is a point inside a distribution, with numerous applications such as
anomaly detection, multivariate or functional data analysis, arising across
various fields. The halfspace depth was the first depth to aim at generalising
the notion of quantile beyond the univariate case. Among the existing variety
of depth definitions, it remains one of the most used notions of data depth.
Taking a different angle from the quantile point of view, we show that the
halfspace depth can also be regarded as the minimum loss of a set of
classifiers for a specific labelling of the points. By changing the loss or the
set of classifiers considered, this new angle naturally leads to a family of
"loss depths", extending to well-studied classifiers such as, e.g., SVM or
logistic regression, among others. This framework directly inherits
computational efficiency of existing machine learning algorithms as well as
their fast statistical convergence rates, and opens the data depth realm to the
high-dimensional setting. Furthermore, the new loss depths highlight a
connection between the dataset and the right amount of complexity or simplicity
of the classifiers. The simplicity of classifiers as well as the interpretation
as a risk makes our new kind of data depth easy to explain, yet efficient for
anomaly detection, as is shown by experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SHACL验证引擎的报告难以被非技术用户理解，xpSHACL旨在解决这一问题。

Result: 生成详细、多语言、易读的约束违规解释，提高效率和一致性。

Conclusion: xpSHACL有效改善了SHACL验证报告的可读性和实用性。

Abstract: Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL) is a powerful language for validating RDF
data. Given the recent industry attention to Knowledge Graphs (KGs), more users
need to validate linked data properly. However, traditional SHACL validation
engines often provide terse reports in English that are difficult for
non-technical users to interpret and act upon. This paper presents xpSHACL, an
explainable SHACL validation system that addresses this issue by combining
rule-based justification trees with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and
large language models (LLMs) to produce detailed, multilanguage, human-readable
explanations for constraint violations. A key feature of xpSHACL is its usage
of a Violation KG to cache and reuse explanations, improving efficiency and
consistency.

Entity-Relationship (ER) modeling that integrates insights from design justice,
participatory AI, and conceptual modeling. ONION introduces a five-stage
methodology: Observe, Nurture, Integrate, Optimize, Normalize. It supports
progressive abstraction from unstructured stakeholder input to structured ER
diagrams.
  Our approach aims to reduce designer bias, promote inclusive participation,
and increase transparency through the modeling process. We evaluate ONION
through real-world workshops focused on sociotechnical systems in Ukraine,
highlighting how diverse stakeholder engagement leads to richer data models and
deeper mutual understanding. Early results demonstrate ONION's potential to
host diversity in early-stage data modeling. We conclude with lessons learned,
limitations and challenges involved in scaling and refining the framework for
broader adoption.

Result: 在合成和真实数据集中，该方法比标准贪婪算法显著更快，且结果质量相近。

Conclusion: 基于哈希的方法在效率和效果上均表现优越，适用于多种数据挖掘任务。

Abstract: Pattern set mining, which is the task of finding a good set of patterns
instead of all patterns, is a fundamental problem in data mining. Many
different definitions of what constitutes a good set have been proposed in
recent years. In this paper, we consider the reconstruction error as a proxy
measure for the goodness of the set, and concentrate on the adjacent problem of
how to find a good set efficiently. We propose a method based on bottom-k
hashing for efficiently selecting the set and extend the method for the common
case where the patterns might only appear in approximate form in the data. Our
approach has applications in tiling databases, Boolean matrix factorization,
and redescription mining, among others. We show that our hashing-based approach
is significantly faster than the standard greedy algorithm while obtaining
almost equally good results in both synthetic and real-world data sets.

Result: 结果表明扩散模型在复杂流体动力学问题中具有潜力，但也存在挑战。

Conclusion: 未来研究可优化计算效率并扩展模型应用范围。

Abstract: In this work, we aimed to replicate and extend the results presented in the
DiffFluid paper[1]. The DiffFluid model showed that diffusion models combined
with Transformers are capable of predicting fluid dynamics. It uses a denoising
diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) framework to tackle Navier-Stokes and
Darcy flow equations. Our goal was to validate the reproducibility of the
methods in the DiffFluid paper while testing its viability for other simulation
types, particularly the Lattice Boltzmann method. Despite our computational
limitations and time constraints, this work provides evidence of the
flexibility and potential of the model as a general-purpose solver for fluid
dynamics. Our results show both the potential and challenges of applying
diffusion models to complex fluid dynamics problems. This work highlights the
opportunities for future research in optimizing the computational efficiency
and scaling such models in broader domains.

Conclusion: 该框架为超可靠无线网络控制系统提供了一种有效的解决方案，首次实现了约束满足与性能优化的结合。

Abstract: In Wireless Networked Control Systems (WNCSs), control and communication
systems must be co-designed due to their strong interdependence. This paper
presents a novel optimization theory-based safe deep reinforcement learning
(DRL) framework for ultra-reliable WNCSs, ensuring constraint satisfaction
while optimizing performance, for the first time in the literature. The
approach minimizes power consumption under key constraints, including Peak Age
of Information (PAoI) violation probability, transmit power, and schedulability
in the finite blocklength regime. PAoI violation probability is uniquely
derived by combining stochastic maximum allowable transfer interval (MATI) and
maximum allowable packet delay (MAD) constraints in a multi-sensor network. The
framework consists of two stages: optimization theory and safe DRL. The first
stage derives optimality conditions to establish mathematical relationships
among variables, simplifying and decomposing the problem. The second stage
employs a safe DRL model where a teacher-student framework guides the DRL agent
(student). The control mechanism (teacher) evaluates compliance with system
constraints and suggests the nearest feasible action when needed. Extensive
simulations show that the proposed framework outperforms rule-based and other
optimization theory based DRL benchmarks, achieving faster convergence, higher
rewards, and greater stability.

Result: InsurTech特征显著提升了预测的鲁棒性，未发现网络事件类型间的显著相关性。

Conclusion: 框架为保险公司和组织提供了透明的、实体特定的网络风险画像，支持定制化承保和风险缓解。

Abstract: The lack of high-quality public cyber incident data limits empirical research
and predictive modeling for cyber risk assessment. This challenge persists due
to the reluctance of companies to disclose incidents that could damage their
reputation or investor confidence. Therefore, from an actuarial perspective,
potential resolutions conclude two aspects: the enhancement of existing cyber
incident datasets and the implementation of advanced modeling techniques to
optimize the use of the available data. A review of existing data-driven
methods highlights a significant lack of entity-specific organizational
features in publicly available datasets. To address this gap, we propose a
novel InsurTech framework that enriches cyber incident data with
entity-specific attributes. We develop various machine learning (ML) models: a
multilabel classification model to predict the occurrence of cyber incident
types (e.g., Privacy Violation, Data Breach, Fraud and Extortion, IT Error, and
Others) and a multioutput regression model to estimate their annual
frequencies. While classifier and regressor chains are implemented to explore
dependencies among cyber incident types as well, no significant correlations
are observed in our datasets. Besides, we apply multiple interpretable ML
techniques to identify and cross-validate potential risk factors developed by
InsurTech across ML models. We find that InsurTech empowered features enhance
prediction occurrence and frequency estimation robustness compared to only
using conventional risk factors. The framework generates transparent,
entity-specific cyber risk profiles, supporting customized underwriting and
proactive cyber risk mitigation. It provides insurers and organizations with
data-driven insights to support decision-making and compliance planning.

Result: 深度神经排序模型优于传统方法，单阶段检索表现良好但仍不及多阶段检索。数据刷新引发了对NIST判断和标签质量的疑问。

Conclusion: 深度学习方法在排序任务中持续领先，但数据刷新和标签质量仍需进一步研究。

Abstract: This is the third year of the TREC Deep Learning track. As in previous years,
we leverage the MS MARCO datasets that made hundreds of thousands of human
annotated training labels available for both passage and document ranking
tasks. In addition, this year we refreshed both the document and the passage
collections which also led to a nearly four times increase in the document
collection size and nearly $16$ times increase in the size of the passage
collection. Deep neural ranking models that employ large scale pretraininig
continued to outperform traditional retrieval methods this year. We also found
that single stage retrieval can achieve good performance on both tasks although
they still do not perform at par with multistage retrieval pipelines. Finally,
the increase in the collection size and the general data refresh raised some
questions about completeness of NIST judgments and the quality of the training
labels that were mapped to the new collections from the old ones which we
discuss in this report.

TL;DR: CUE-RAG是一种新型的检索增强生成方法，通过多粒度图索引、混合提取策略和查询驱动的迭代检索，显著提升了问答性能，同时降低了索引成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型（LLM）在问答任务中表现优异，但其性能受限于领域特定和最新知识的缺乏。现有的基于图的检索增强生成方法因图质量差和查询信息利用不足而受限。

Method: CUE-RAG提出多粒度图索引（文本块、知识单元和实体）、混合提取策略以减少LLM标记使用，以及查询驱动的迭代检索策略（Q-Iter）。

Result: 在三个问答基准测试中，CUE-RAG显著优于现有方法，准确率和F1分数分别提升99.33%和113.51%，同时索引成本降低72.58%。

Conclusion: CUE-RAG在提升基于图的检索增强生成系统性能和成本效益方面表现出色。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress of Large Language Models (LLMs), their
performance in question answering (QA) remains limited by the lack of
domain-specific and up-to-date knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
addresses this limitation by incorporating external information, often from
graph-structured data. However, existing graph-based RAG methods suffer from
poor graph quality due to incomplete extraction and insufficient utilization of
query information during retrieval. To overcome these limitations, we propose
CUE-RAG, a novel approach that introduces (1) a multi-partite graph index
incorporates text Chunks, knowledge Units, and Entities to capture semantic
content at multiple levels of granularity, (2) a hybrid extraction strategy
that reduces LLM token usage while still producing accurate and disambiguated
knowledge units, and (3) Q-Iter, a query-driven iterative retrieval strategy
that enhances relevance through semantic search and constrained graph
traversal. Experiments on three QA benchmarks show that CUE-RAG significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 99.33% higher Accuracy
and 113.51% higher F1 score while reducing indexing costs by 72.58%.
Remarkably, CUE-RAG matches or outperforms baselines even without using an LLM
for indexing. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and cost-efficiency
of CUE-RAG in advancing graph-based RAG systems.

Abstract: Quantitative facts are continually generated by companies and governments,
supporting data-driven decision-making. While common facts are structured, many
long-tail quantitative facts remain buried in unstructured documents, making
them difficult to access. We propose the task of Quantity Retrieval: given a
description of a quantitative fact, the system returns the relevant value and
supporting evidence. Understanding quantity semantics in context is essential
for this task. We introduce a framework based on description parsing that
converts text into structured (description, quantity) pairs for effective
retrieval. To improve learning, we construct a large paraphrase dataset using
weak supervision based on quantity co-occurrence. We evaluate our approach on a
large corpus of financial annual reports and a newly annotated quantity
description dataset. Our method significantly improves top-1 retrieval accuracy
from 30.98 percent to 64.66 percent.

Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) and agentic systems is enabling
autonomous 6G networks with advanced intelligence, including
self-configuration, self-optimization, and self-healing. However, the current
implementation of individual intelligence tasks necessitates isolated knowledge
retrieval pipelines, resulting in redundant data flows and inconsistent
interpretations. Inspired by the service model unification effort in Open-RAN
(to support interoperability and vendor diversity), we propose KP-A: a unified
Network Knowledge Plane specifically designed for Agentic network intelligence.
By decoupling network knowledge acquisition and management from intelligence
logic, KP-A streamlines development and reduces maintenance complexity for
intelligence engineers. By offering an intuitive and consistent knowledge
interface, KP-A also enhances interoperability for the network intelligence
agents. We demonstrate KP-A in two representative intelligence tasks: live
network knowledge Q&A and edge AI service orchestration. All implementation
artifacts have been open-sourced to support reproducibility and future
standardization efforts.

Conclusion: 本文为6G AI-Native RAN的标准化设计提供了Day 1框架，平衡了技术创新与实际部署。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) has become the most certain
and prominent feature of 6G mobile networks. Unlike 5G, where AI/ML was not
natively integrated but rather an add-on feature over existing architecture, 6G
shall incorporate AI from the onset to address its complexity and support
ubiquitous AI applications. Based on our extensive mobile network operation and
standardization experience from 2G to 5G, this paper explores the design and
standardization principles of AI-Native radio access networks (RAN) for 6G,
with a particular focus on its critical Day 1 architecture, functionalities and
capabilities. We investigate the framework of AI-Native RAN and present its
three essential capabilities to shed some light on the standardization
direction; namely, AI-driven RAN processing/optimization/automation, reliable
AI lifecycle management (LCM), and AI-as-a-Service (AIaaS) provisioning. The
standardization of AI-Native RAN, in particular the Day 1 features, including
an AI-Native 6G RAN architecture, were proposed. For validation, a large-scale
field trial with over 5000 5G-A base stations have been built and delivered
significant improvements in average air interface latency, root cause
identification, and network energy consumption with the proposed architecture
and the supporting AI functions. This paper aims to provide a Day 1 framework
for 6G AI-Native RAN standardization design, balancing technical innovation
with practical deployment.

Motivation: 量子神经网络（QNN）在量子机器学习（QML）中具有巨大潜力，但其安全性和鲁棒性尚未充分探索。

Method: 利用量子门的酉性质和Hadamard门的叠加特性，设计并实施了QuPTs攻击。

Result: 实验表明，QuPTs具有高度隐蔽性，显著降低了QNN的性能，其中最具破坏性的攻击导致准确率下降23%。

Conclusion: 这是首个针对完全量子神经网络的特洛伊攻击研究，独立于任何经典-量子混合架构。

Abstract: Quantum neural networks (QNN) hold immense potential for the future of
quantum machine learning (QML). However, QNN security and robustness remain
largely unexplored. In this work, we proposed novel Trojan attacks based on the
quantum computing properties in a QNN-based binary classifier. Our proposed
Quantum Properties Trojans (QuPTs) are based on the unitary property of quantum
gates to insert noise and Hadamard gates to enable superposition to develop
Trojans and attack QNNs. We showed that the proposed QuPTs are significantly
stealthier and heavily impact the quantum circuits' performance, specifically
QNNs. The most impactful QuPT caused a deterioration of 23% accuracy of the
compromised QNN under the experimental setup. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first work on the Trojan attack on a fully quantum neural network

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子机器学习（QML）中PQCs的应用潜力尚未在量子化学相关数据集中得到充分探索，本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 结合14种数据编码策略和12种变分ansätze构建168种PQCs，并在5和16量子位的电路上评估性能，包括电路结构、深度和训练集大小的影响。

Result: 研究发现PQCs在化学问题上表现不如经典机器学习方法，但仍展示了量子方法的潜力。

Conclusion: PQCs在化学相关问题上仍面临挑战，需进一步优化以提升性能。

Abstract: In the field of quantum machine learning (QML), parametrized quantum circuits
(PQCs) -- constructed using a combination of fixed and tunable quantum gates --
provide a promising hybrid framework for tackling complex machine learning
problems. Despite numerous proposed applications, there remains limited
exploration of datasets relevant to quantum chemistry. In this study, we
investigate the potential benefits and limitations of PQCs on two chemically
meaningful datasets: (1) the BSE49 dataset, containing bond separation energies
for 49 different classes of chemical bonds, and (2) a dataset of water
conformations, where coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) wavefunctions
are predicted from lower-level electronic structure methods using the
data-driven coupled-cluster (DDCC) approach. We construct a comprehensive set
of 168 PQCs by combining 14 data encoding strategies with 12 variational
ans{\"a}tze, and evaluate their performance on circuits with 5 and 16 qubits.
Our initial analysis examines the impact of circuit structure on model
performance using state-vector simulations. We then explore how circuit depth
and training set size influence model performance. Finally, we assess the
performance of the best-performing PQCs on current quantum hardware, using both
noisy simulations ("fake" backends) and real quantum devices. Our findings
underscore the challenges of applying PQCs to chemically relevant problems that
are straightforward for classical machine learning methods but remain
non-trivial for quantum approaches.

Motivation: 解决稀疏凸优化问题在机器学习和数据科学中的广泛应用需求，利用量子计算优势提升效率。

Method: 针对向量域和矩阵域分别设计量子算法，利用函数值预言机降低查询和时间复杂度。

Result: 向量域算法查询复杂度为O(√d/ε)和O(1/ε)，矩阵域算法时间复杂度为O~(rd/ε²)和O~(√rd/ε³)，均优于经典算法。

Abstract: This paper considers the projection-free sparse convex optimization problem
for the vector domain and the matrix domain, which covers a large number of
important applications in machine learning and data science. For the vector
domain $\mathcal{D} \subset \mathbb{R}^d$, we propose two quantum algorithms
for sparse constraints that finds a $\varepsilon$-optimal solution with the
query complexity of $O(\sqrt{d}/\varepsilon)$ and $O(1/\varepsilon)$ by using
the function value oracle, reducing a factor of $O(\sqrt{d})$ and $O(d)$ over
the best classical algorithm, respectively, where $d$ is the dimension. For the
matrix domain $\mathcal{D} \subset \mathbb{R}^{d\times d}$, we propose two
quantum algorithms for nuclear norm constraints that improve the time
complexity to $\tilde{O}(rd/\varepsilon^2)$ and
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{r}d/\varepsilon^3)$ for computing the update step, reducing at
least a factor of $O(\sqrt{d})$ over the best classical algorithm, where $r$ is
the rank of the gradient matrix. Our algorithms show quantum advantages in
projection-free sparse convex optimization problems as they outperform the
optimal classical methods in dependence on the dimension $d$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子机器学习继承了经典机器学习的漏洞，并引入了新的攻击面，但目前研究多孤立分析攻击向量，缺乏整体视角。

Method: 作者提出将杀伤链模型（如MITRE ATLAS）应用于QML，构建了一个详细的攻击向量分类框架，涵盖物理层、算法层和隐私攻击。

Conclusion: 该研究为量子机器学习提供了更现实的威胁模型，支持深度防御设计，推动了这一新兴领域的安全性发展。

Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) systems inherit vulnerabilities from classical
machine learning while introducing new attack surfaces rooted in the physical
and algorithmic layers of quantum computing. Despite a growing body of research
on individual attack vectors - ranging from adversarial poisoning and evasion
to circuit-level backdoors, side-channel leakage, and model extraction - these
threats are often analyzed in isolation, with unrealistic assumptions about
attacker capabilities and system environments. This fragmentation hampers the
development of effective, holistic defense strategies. In this work, we argue
that QML security requires more structured modeling of the attack surface,
capturing not only individual techniques but also their relationships,
prerequisites, and potential impact across the QML pipeline. We propose
adapting kill chain models, widely used in classical IT and cybersecurity, to
the quantum machine learning context. Such models allow for structured
reasoning about attacker objectives, capabilities, and possible multi-stage
attack paths - spanning reconnaissance, initial access, manipulation,
persistence, and exfiltration. Based on extensive literature analysis, we
present a detailed taxonomy of QML attack vectors mapped to corresponding
stages in a quantum-aware kill chain framework that is inspired by the MITRE
ATLAS for classical machine learning. We highlight interdependencies between
physical-level threats (like side-channel leakage and crosstalk faults), data
and algorithm manipulation (such as poisoning or circuit backdoors), and
privacy attacks (including model extraction and training data inference). This
work provides a foundation for more realistic threat modeling and proactive
security-in-depth design in the emerging field of quantum machine learning.

Motivation: 现有代理框架缺乏原则性建模步骤，主要依赖情感或趋势分析，无法有效支持金融领域的决策。

Method: 开发了一种代理系统，利用LLM迭代发现随机微分方程，生成风险指标以指导交易决策，并通过传统回测和市场模拟器评估。

Result: 模型驱动的交易策略优于标准LLM代理，提高了多只股票的夏普比率。

Conclusion: 结合LLM与代理模型发现可增强市场风险估计，实现更有利可图的交易决策。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in agentic frameworks,
in which prompts trigger complex tool-based analysis in pursuit of a goal.
While these frameworks have shown promise across multiple domains including in
finance, they typically lack a principled model-building step, relying instead
on sentiment- or trend-based analysis. We address this gap by developing an
agentic system that uses LLMs to iteratively discover stochastic differential
equations for financial time series. These models generate risk metrics which
inform daily trading decisions. We evaluate our system in both traditional
backtests and using a market simulator, which introduces synthetic but causally
plausible price paths and news events. We find that model-informed trading
strategies outperform standard LLM-based agents, improving Sharpe ratios across
multiple equities. Our results show that combining LLMs with agentic model
discovery enhances market risk estimation and enables more profitable trading
decisions.

Result: 方法显著减少时间和精力，提高角色质量，但泛化和领域特异性存在局限。

Conclusion: 生成式AI可有效整合到产品发现中，但需解决泛化和情感共鸣问题。

Abstract: Proto-personas are commonly used during early-stage Product Discovery, such
as Lean Inception, to guide product definition and stakeholder alignment.
However, the manual creation of proto-personas is often time-consuming,
cognitively demanding, and prone to bias. In this paper, we propose and
empirically investigate a prompt engineering-based approach to generate
proto-personas with the support of Generative AI (GenAI). Our goal is to
evaluate the approach in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, user acceptance,
and the empathy elicited by the generated personas. We conducted a case study
with 19 participants embedded in a real Lean Inception, employing a qualitative
and quantitative methods design. The results reveal the approach's efficiency
by reducing time and effort and improving the quality and reusability of
personas in later discovery phases, such as Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
scoping and feature refinement. While acceptance was generally high, especially
regarding perceived usefulness and ease of use, participants noted limitations
related to generalization and domain specificity. Furthermore, although
cognitive empathy was strongly supported, affective and behavioral empathy
varied significantly across participants. These results contribute novel
empirical evidence on how GenAI can be effectively integrated into software
Product Discovery practices, while also identifying key challenges to be
addressed in future iterations of such hybrid design processes.

TL;DR: DHDA是一个在线配置性能学习框架，通过双重层次适应机制处理动态环境中的全局和局部概念漂移，显著提升准确性和适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代可配置软件系统在动态环境中运行时，工作负载变化、硬件更新和系统升级会导致全局和局部概念漂移，现有离线学习和迁移学习方法难以实时适应这些变化。

Method: DHDA采用双重层次适应机制：上层通过重新划分数据并局部重训练处理全局漂移；下层通过局部模型异步检测和适应局部漂移。结合增量更新和定期完全重训练以平衡响应速度和效率。

Result: 在八个软件系统上的评估显示，DHDA显著优于现有方法，准确性提升高达2倍，同时保持合理开销。

Conclusion: DHDA能有效适应动态环境中的概念漂移，提升配置性能学习的准确性和适应性。

Abstract: Modern configurable software systems need to learn models that correlate
configuration and performance. However, when the system operates in dynamic
environments, the workload variations, hardware changes, and system updates
will inevitably introduce concept drifts at different levels - global drifts,
which reshape the performance landscape of the entire configuration space; and
local drifts, which only affect certain sub-regions of that space. As such,
existing offline and transfer learning approaches can struggle to adapt to
these implicit and unpredictable changes in real-time, rendering configuration
performance learning challenging. To address this, we propose DHDA, an online
configuration performance learning framework designed to capture and adapt to
these drifts at different levels. The key idea is that DHDA adapts to both the
local and global drifts using dually hierarchical adaptation: at the upper
level, we redivide the data into different divisions, within each of which the
local model is retrained, to handle global drifts only when necessary. At the
lower level, the local models of the divisions can detect local drifts and
adapt themselves asynchronously. To balance responsiveness and efficiency, DHDA
combines incremental updates with periodic full retraining to minimize
redundant computation when no drifts are detected. Through evaluating eight
software systems and against state-of-the-art approaches, we show that DHDA
achieves considerably better accuracy and can effectively adapt to drifts with
up to 2x improvements, while incurring reasonable overhead and is able to
improve different local models in handling concept drift.

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型在边缘设备上的广泛应用，保护知识产权免受恶意用户窃取的需求日益增长。

Method: 为每个用户生成唯一密钥，通过模型不变性构建线性约束以生成稳定水印值，并采用噪声机制隐藏水印位置以防止共谋攻击。

Result: 在Llama3、Phi3和Gemma模型上测试，实验结果表明该方案对多种攻击方法（如微调、剪枝、量化等）具有强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该水印方案能有效保护模型IP，适用于多用户场景，且无需额外训练或微调。

Abstract: Watermarking technology has gained significant attention due to the
increasing importance of intellectual property (IP) rights, particularly with
the growing deployment of large language models (LLMs) on billions
resource-constrained edge devices. To counter the potential threats of IP theft
by malicious users, this paper introduces a robust watermarking scheme without
retraining or fine-tuning for transformer models. The scheme generates a unique
key for each user and derives a stable watermark value by solving linear
constraints constructed from model invariants. Moreover, this technology
utilizes noise mechanism to hide watermark locations in multi-user scenarios
against collusion attack. This paper evaluates the approach on three popular
models (Llama3, Phi3, Gemma), and the experimental results confirm the strong
robustness across a range of attack methods (fine-tuning, pruning,
quantization, permutation, scaling, reversible matrix and collusion attacks).

assumptions in AI model scaling. Utilizing an innovative architecture that
integrates Mamba layers, linear self-attention, and a Mixture of Experts
framework, White-Basilisk achieves state-of-the-art results in vulnerability
detection tasks with a parameter count of only 200M. The model's capacity to
process sequences of unprecedented length enables comprehensive analysis of
extensive codebases in a single pass, surpassing the context limitations of
current Large Language Models (LLMs). White-Basilisk exhibits robust
performance on imbalanced, real-world datasets, while maintaining computational
efficiency that facilitates deployment across diverse organizational scales.
This research not only establishes new benchmarks in code security but also

Motivation: 主题分析在大型医疗研究中资源密集，LLM可能解决这一问题，但其在心理健康访谈中的应用需与传统方法对比。

Method: 使用GPT-4o模型和RISEN提示框架，与传统人工分析（Dedoose）对比，评估代码开发、饱和点和主题合成。

Result: LLM在演绎代码开发上接近人工，但人工在归纳代码和主题合成上更优；知识库LLM饱和更快。

Conclusion: LLM可提升心理健康研究的定性分析效率，但需结合人工监督以平衡深度与资源。

Abstract: Thematic analysis provides valuable insights into participants' experiences
through coding and theme development, but its resource-intensive nature limits
its use in large healthcare studies. Large language models (LLMs) can analyze
text at scale and identify key content automatically, potentially addressing
these challenges. However, their application in mental health interviews needs
comparison with traditional human analysis. This study evaluates out-of-the-box
and knowledge-base LLM-based thematic analysis against traditional methods
using transcripts from a stress-reduction trial with healthcare workers.
OpenAI's GPT-4o model was used along with the Role, Instructions, Steps,
End-Goal, Narrowing (RISEN) prompt engineering framework and compared to human
analysis in Dedoose. Each approach developed codes, noted saturation points,
applied codes to excerpts for a subset of participants (n = 20), and
synthesized data into themes. Outputs and performance metrics were compared
directly. LLMs using the RISEN framework developed deductive parent codes
similar to human codes, but humans excelled in inductive child code development
and theme synthesis. Knowledge-based LLMs reached coding saturation with fewer
transcripts (10-15) than the out-of-the-box model (15-20) and humans (90-99).
The out-of-the-box LLM identified a comparable number of excerpts to human
researchers, showing strong inter-rater reliability (K = 0.84), though the
knowledge-based LLM produced fewer excerpts. Human excerpts were longer and
involved multiple codes per excerpt, while LLMs typically applied one code.
Overall, LLM-based thematic analysis proved more cost-effective but lacked the
depth of human analysis. LLMs can transform qualitative analysis in mental
healthcare and clinical research when combined with human oversight to balance
participant perspectives and research resources.

Motivation: 现有方法在重建精度、计算成本和验证方面存在困难，主要由于难以获取手标数据。

Method: 采用半监督学习框架，从基于最小抖动原则生成的合成数据中学习，并通过适应未标记的人类运动数据迭代优化。

Result: 模型在合成和多样化人类运动数据集上显著优于现有方法，且能在高噪声条件下运行，实时性极强（每输入秒不到一毫秒）。

Conclusion: SSSUMO在多个应用领域（如人机交互、康复医学和运动控制研究）表现出色，尤其在传统方法难以处理的数据集上效果显著。

Abstract: This paper introduces a SSSUMO, semi-supervised deep learning approach for
submovement decomposition that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and speed.
While submovement analysis offers valuable insights into motor control,
existing methods struggle with reconstruction accuracy, computational cost, and
validation, due to the difficulty of obtaining hand-labeled data. We address
these challenges using a semi-supervised learning framework. This framework
learns from synthetic data, initially generated from minimum-jerk principles
and then iteratively refined through adaptation to unlabeled human movement
data. Our fully convolutional architecture with differentiable reconstruction
significantly surpasses existing methods on both synthetic and diverse human
motion datasets, demonstrating robustness even in high-noise conditions.
Crucially, the model operates in real-time (less than a millisecond per input
second), a substantial improvement over optimization-based techniques. This
enhanced performance facilitates new applications in human-computer
interaction, rehabilitation medicine, and motor control studies. We demonstrate
the model's effectiveness across diverse human-performed tasks such as
steering, rotation, pointing, object moving, handwriting, and mouse-controlled
gaming, showing notable improvements particularly on challenging datasets where
traditional methods largely fail. Training and benchmarking source code, along
with pre-trained model weights, are made publicly available at

Abstract: Emotion detection in older adults is crucial for understanding their
cognitive and emotional well-being, especially in hospital and assisted living
environments. In this work, we investigate an edge-based, non-obtrusive
approach to emotion identification that uses only physiological signals
obtained via wearable sensors. Our dataset includes data from 40 older
individuals. Emotional states were obtained using physiological signals from
the Empatica E4 and Shimmer3 GSR+ wristband and facial expressions were
recorded using camera-based emotion recognition with the iMotion's Facial
Expression Analysis (FEA) module. The dataset also contains twelve emotion
categories in terms of relative intensities. We aim to study how well emotion
recognition can be accomplished using simply physiological sensor data, without
the requirement for cameras or intrusive facial analysis. By leveraging
classical machine learning models, we predict the intensity of emotional
responses based on physiological signals. We achieved the highest 0.782 r2
score with the lowest 0.0006 MSE on the regression task. This method has
significant implications for individuals with Alzheimer's Disease and Related
Dementia (ADRD), as well as veterans coping with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder
(PTSD) or other cognitive impairments. Our results across multiple classical
regression models validate the feasibility of this method, paving the way for
privacy-preserving and efficient emotion recognition systems in real-world

including Real-Time 3D Reconstruction (RT-3DR), intelligent navigation, and
large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), to create a comprehensive system for

smartphone is employed within AIRS to perform RT-3DR of living spaces and has a
body-matched avatar to provide visual feedback about the excercise. This avatar
is necessary in (a) optimizing exercise configurations, including camera
placement, patient positioning, and initial poses, and (b) addressing privacy
concerns and promoting compliance with the AI Act. The system guides users
through the recording process to ensure the collection of properly recorded
videos. AIRS employs two feedback mechanisms: (i) visual 3D feedback, enabling
direct comparisons between prerecorded clinical exercises and patient home
recordings and (ii) VLM-generated feedback, providing detailed explanations and
corrections for exercise errors. The framework also supports people with visual

Motivation: 现有拖拽编辑方法因仅匹配用户定义点而忽略整体几何，导致编辑结果不稳定或产生伪影。

Method: FlowDrag构建3D网格，通过能量函数指导网格变形，并将变形结果投影到2D后融入UNet去噪过程，实现精确编辑。

Result: FlowDrag在VFD Bench和DragBench上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FlowDrag通过几何信息提升编辑准确性，并引入VFD基准数据集填补评估空白。

Abstract: Drag-based editing allows precise object manipulation through point-based
control, offering user convenience. However, current methods often suffer from
a geometric inconsistency problem by focusing exclusively on matching
user-defined points, neglecting the broader geometry and leading to artifacts
or unstable edits. We propose FlowDrag, which leverages geometric information
for more accurate and coherent transformations. Our approach constructs a 3D
mesh from the image, using an energy function to guide mesh deformation based
on user-defined drag points. The resulting mesh displacements are projected
into 2D and incorporated into a UNet denoising process, enabling precise
handle-to-target point alignment while preserving structural integrity.
Additionally, existing drag-editing benchmarks provide no ground truth, making
it difficult to assess how accurately the edits match the intended
transformations. To address this, we present VFD (VidFrameDrag) benchmark
dataset, which provides ground-truth frames using consecutive shots in a video
dataset. FlowDrag outperforms existing drag-based editing methods on both VFD
Bench and DragBench.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with accurately capturing
camera-object relations, especially for object orientation, camera viewpoint,
and camera shots. This stems from the fact that existing MLLMs are trained on
images with limited diverse camera-object relations and corresponding textual
descriptions. To address this, we propose a synthetic generation pipeline to
create large-scale 3D visual instruction datasets. Our framework takes 3D
assets as input and uses rendering and diffusion-based image generation models
to create photorealistic images preserving precise camera-object relations.
Additionally, large language models (LLMs) are used to generate text prompts
for guiding visual instruction tuning and controlling image generation. We
create Ultimate3D, a dataset of 240K VQAs with precise camera-object
annotations, and corresponding benchmark. MLLMs fine-tuned on our proposed
dataset outperform commercial models by a large margin, achieving an average
accuracy improvement of 33.4% on camera-object relation recognition tasks. Our
code, dataset, and benchmark will contribute to broad MLLM applications.

Abstract: What should a function that extrapolates beyond known input/output examples
look like? This is a tricky question to answer in general, as any function
matching the outputs on those examples can in principle be a correct
extrapolant. We argue that a "good" extrapolant should follow certain kinds of
rules, and here we study a particularly appealing criterion for rule-following
in list functions: that the function should behave predictably even when
certain elements are removed. In functional programming, a standard way to
express such removal operations is by using a filter function. Accordingly, our
paper introduces a new semantic class of functions -- the filter equivariant
functions. We show that this class contains interesting examples, prove some
basic theorems about it, and relate it to the well-known class of map
equivariant functions. We also present a geometric account of filter
equivariants, showing how they correspond naturally to certain simplicial
structures. Our highlight result is the amalgamation algorithm, which
constructs any filter-equivariant function's output by first studying how it
behaves on sublists of the input, in a way that extrapolates perfectly.

Abstract: Intracortical Brain-Computer Interfaces (iBCI) aim to decode behavior from
neural population activity, enabling individuals with motor impairments to
regain motor functions and communication abilities. A key challenge in
long-term iBCI is the nonstationarity of neural recordings, where the
composition and tuning profiles of the recorded populations are unstable across
recording sessions. Existing methods attempt to address this issue by explicit
alignment techniques; however, they rely on fixed neural identities and require
test-time labels or parameter updates, limiting their generalization across
sessions and imposing additional computational burden during deployment. In
this work, we introduce SPINT - a Spatial Permutation-Invariant Neural
Transformer framework for behavioral decoding that operates directly on
unordered sets of neural units. Central to our approach is a novel
context-dependent positional embedding scheme that dynamically infers
unit-specific identities, enabling flexible generalization across recording
sessions. SPINT supports inference on variable-size populations and allows
few-shot, gradient-free adaptation using a small amount of unlabeled data from
the test session. To further promote model robustness to population
variability, we introduce dynamic channel dropout, a regularization method for
iBCI that simulates shifts in population composition during training. We
evaluate SPINT on three multi-session datasets from the FALCON Benchmark,
covering continuous motor decoding tasks in human and non-human primates. SPINT
demonstrates robust cross-session generalization, outperforming existing
zero-shot and few-shot unsupervised baselines while eliminating the need for
test-time alignment and fine-tuning. Our work contributes an initial step
toward a robust and scalable neural decoding framework for long-term iBCI
applications.

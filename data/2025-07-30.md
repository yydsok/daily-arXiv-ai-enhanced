### [1] [SynLang and Symbiotic Epistemology: A Manifesto for Conscious Human-AI Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21067)
*Jan Kapusta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的哲学基础（共生认识论）和形式化协议（SynLang），用于透明的人类-AI协作，通过双层次透明度和信心校准增强信任与合作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI系统的不透明性阻碍了人类监督和协作潜力，现有可解释AI方法无法实现真正的共生合作。

Method: 提出共生认识论作为哲学基础，并开发SynLang协议（包括TRACE和TRACE_FE机制）实现透明协作，通过信心量化和结构化沟通验证。

Result: 实证验证显示AI能适应结构化推理协议并进行元认知干预，协议支持快速理解和详细验证AI决策。

Conclusion: SynLang和共生认识论结合可提升人类智能、保留人类能动性，并在协作决策中维护伦理责任。

Abstract: Current AI systems rely on opaque reasoning processes that hinder human
oversight and collaborative potential. Conventional explainable AI approaches
offer post-hoc justifications and often fail to establish genuine symbiotic
collaboration. In this paper, the Symbiotic Epistemology is presented as a
philosophical foundation for human-AI cognitive partnerships. Unlike frameworks
that treat AI as a mere tool or replacement, symbiotic epistemology positions
AI as a reasoning partner, fostering calibrated trust by aligning human
confidence with AI reliability through explicit reasoning patterns and
confidence assessments. SynLang (Symbiotic Syntactic Language) is introduced as
a formal protocol for transparent human-AI collaboration. The framework is
empirically validated through actual human-AI dialogues demonstrating AI's
adaptation to structured reasoning protocols and successful metacognitive
intervention. The protocol defines two complementary mechanisms: TRACE for
high-level reasoning patterns and TRACE_FE for detailed factor explanations. It
also integrates confidence quantification, declarative control over AI
behavior, and context inheritance for multi-agent coordination. By structuring
communication and embedding confidence-calibrated transparency, SynLang,
together with symbiotic epistemology, enables AI systems that enhance human
intelligence, preserve human agency, and uphold ethical accountability in
collaborative decision-making. Through dual-level transparency, beginning with
high-level reasoning patterns and progressing to granular explanations, the
protocol facilitates rapid comprehension and supports thorough verification of
AI decision-making.

### [3] [Leveraging Generative AI to Enhance Synthea Module Development](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21123)
*Mark A. Kramer,Aanchal Mathur,Caroline E. Adams,Jason A. Walonoski*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了利用大型语言模型（LLMs）辅助开发Synthea（开源合成健康数据生成器）的新疾病模块，以减少开发时间、降低专业需求、增加模型多样性并提升数据质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过LLMs辅助模块开发，旨在提高效率、降低门槛，并提升合成数据的多样性和质量。

Method: 提出了四种LLMs支持Synthea模块开发的方式：生成疾病概况、从概况生成模块、评估现有模块及优化模块，并引入渐进式优化概念。

Result: LLMs在模块开发中展现出潜力，但也存在需人工监督、严格测试及验证的挑战。

Conclusion: 未来需进一步研究以充分发挥LLMs在合成数据生成中的潜力。

Abstract: This paper explores the use of large language models (LLMs) to assist in the
development of new disease modules for Synthea, an open-source synthetic health
data generator. Incorporating LLMs into the module development process has the
potential to reduce development time, reduce required expertise, expand model
diversity, and improve the overall quality of synthetic patient data. We
demonstrate four ways that LLMs can support Synthea module creation: generating
a disease profile, generating a disease module from a disease profile,
evaluating an existing Synthea module, and refining an existing module. We
introduce the concept of progressive refinement, which involves iteratively
evaluating the LLM-generated module by checking its syntactic correctness and
clinical accuracy, and then using that information to modify the module. While
the use of LLMs in this context shows promise, we also acknowledge the
challenges and limitations, such as the need for human oversight, the
importance of rigorous testing and validation, and the potential for
inaccuracies in LLM-generated content. The paper concludes with recommendations
for future research and development to fully realize the potential of LLM-aided
synthetic data creation.

### [4] [Measuring and Analyzing Intelligence via Contextual Uncertainty in Large Language Models using Information-Theoretic Metrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21129)
*Jae Wan Shim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种任务无关的方法，通过“认知剖面”和“熵衰减曲线”分析大型语言模型（LLMs）的信息处理机制，揭示了模型规模和文本复杂性对其认知特性的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs的内部工作机制，超越传统任务性能指标，探索模型如何处理信息。

Method: 引入任务无关的“认知剖面”方法，基于熵衰减曲线和“信息增益跨度”（IGS）指数，分析模型的预测不确定性随上下文长度的变化。

Result: 发现不同LLMs具有独特且一致的认知剖面，且这些剖面受模型规模和文本复杂性影响。

Conclusion: 提供了一种新的、原则性的方法，用于分析和比较人工智能的内在操作动态。

Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are now
extensively documented on task-specific benchmarks, yet the internal mechanisms
that produce these results are the subject of intense scientific inquiry. This
paper contributes to this inquiry by moving beyond metrics that measure
\textit{what} models can do, to a methodology that characterizes \textit{how}
they process information. We introduce a novel, task-agnostic approach to probe
these dynamics by creating a quantitative ``Cognitive Profile" for any given
model. This profile is centered on the \textbf{Entropy Decay Curve}, a
visualization that traces how a model's normalized predictive uncertainty
changes as a function of context length. Applying this methodology to several
state-of-the-art LLMs across diverse texts, we uncover unique and consistent
cognitive profiles that are sensitive to both model scale and text complexity.
We also introduce the Information Gain Span (IGS) index to summarize the
desirability of the decay trajectory. This work thus provides a new, principled
lens for analyzing and comparing the intrinsic operational dynamics of
artificial intelligence.

### [6] [Adaptive Cluster Collaborativeness Boosts LLMs Medical Decision Support Capacity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21159)
*Zhihao Peng,Liuxin Bao,Shengyuan Liu,Yixuan Yuan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应集群协作方法，通过自多样性和跨一致性最大化机制提升LLMs在医疗决策支持中的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs协作方法缺乏明确的组件选择规则，且依赖预定义集群，部分LLMs在医疗场景中表现不佳。

Method: 通过计算LLM内部输出的模糊匹配值（自多样性）和与其他LLM的跨一致性值，动态优化集群组件。

Result: 在NEJMQA和MMLU-Pro-health数据集上表现优异，例如在NEJMQA上达到官方及格分数，优于GPT-4。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了LLMs在医疗决策支持中的协作效果，无需额外训练。

Abstract: The collaborativeness of large language models (LLMs) has proven effective in
natural language processing systems, holding considerable promise for
healthcare development. However, it lacks explicit component selection rules,
necessitating human intervention or clinical-specific validation. Moreover,
existing architectures heavily rely on a predefined LLM cluster, where partial
LLMs underperform in medical decision support scenarios, invalidating the
collaborativeness of LLMs. To this end, we propose an adaptive cluster
collaborativeness methodology involving self-diversity and cross-consistency
maximization mechanisms to boost LLMs medical decision support capacity. For
the self-diversity, we calculate the fuzzy matching value of pairwise outputs
within an LLM as its self-diversity value, subsequently prioritizing LLMs with
high self-diversity values as cluster components in a training-free manner. For
the cross-consistency, we first measure cross-consistency values between the
LLM with the highest self-diversity value and others, and then gradually mask
out the LLM having the lowest cross-consistency value to eliminate the
potential inconsistent output during the collaborative propagation. Extensive
experiments on two specialized medical datasets, NEJMQA and MMLU-Pro-health,
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across physician-oriented
specialties. For example, on NEJMQA, our method achieves the accuracy rate up
to the publicly official passing score across all disciplines, especially
achieving ACC of 65.47\% compared to the 56.12\% achieved by GPT-4 on the
Obstetrics and Gynecology discipline.

### [7] [NPO: Learning Alignment and Meta-Alignment through Structured Human Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21131)
*Madhava Gaikwad,Ashwini Ramchandra Doke*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NPO是一个对齐感知的学习框架，通过结构化反馈实现人类参与决策系统的动态调整，提供可测量、可监督的对齐损失减少方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法将对齐视为静态或事后属性的问题，提出动态对齐框架以适应实际需求。

Method: 引入对齐损失的形式化定义，提出元对齐概念，并通过场景评分、阈值调整、策略验证和结构化反馈实现操作循环。

Result: 在随机反馈下，对齐损失和监控保真度均收敛，实证显示NPO在大规模部署中有效。

Conclusion: NPO为持续对齐监控提供了紧凑、可检查的架构，将理论对齐保证与实际动态环境可靠性结合。

Abstract: We present NPO, an alignment-aware learning framework that operationalizes
feedback-driven adaptation in human-in-the-loop decision systems. Unlike prior
approaches that treat alignment as a static or post-hoc property, NPO
introduces a formalization of alignment loss that is measurable, supervisable,
and reducible under structured feedback. In parallel, we propose meta-alignment
as the fidelity of the monitoring process that governs retraining or override
triggers, and show that it is formally reducible to primary alignment via
threshold fidelity. Our implementation spans a scalable operational loop
involving scenario scoring, threshold tuning, policy validation, and structured
feedback ingestion, including "likes", overrides, and abstentions. We provide
formal convergence results under stochastic feedback and show that both
alignment loss and monitoring fidelity converge additively. Empirically, NPO
demonstrates measurable value in hyperscale deployment settings. A
simulation-based artifact and ablation studies further illustrate the
theoretical principles in action. Together, NPO offers a compact, inspectable
architecture for continual alignment monitoring, helping bridge theoretical
alignment guarantees with practical reliability in dynamic environments.

### [8] [Games Agents Play: Towards Transactional Analysis in LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21354)
*Monika Zamojska,Jarosław A. Chudziak*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Trans-ACT将交易分析原则嵌入多智能体系统，生成具有心理动态的智能体，模拟更真实的社交互动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多智能体系统缺乏对人类行为认知复杂性的模拟，Trans-ACT旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过将Parent、Adult和Child自我状态整合到智能体认知架构中，结合情境记忆生成响应。

Result: 实验模拟显示，基于认知和TA原则的智能体能产生更深层次的情境感知互动。

Conclusion: Trans-ACT为冲突解决、教育支持和心理学研究等应用开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) are increasingly used to simulate social
interactions, but most of the frameworks miss the underlying cognitive
complexity of human behavior. In this paper, we introduce Trans-ACT
(Transactional Analysis Cognitive Toolkit), an approach embedding Transactional
Analysis (TA) principles into MAS to generate agents with realistic
psychological dynamics. Trans-ACT integrates the Parent, Adult, and Child ego
states into an agent's cognitive architecture. Each ego state retrieves
context-specific memories and uses them to shape response to new situations.
The final answer is chosen according to the underlying life script of the
agent. Our experimental simulation, which reproduces the Stupid game scenario,
demonstrates that agents grounded in cognitive and TA principles produce deeper
and context-aware interactions. Looking ahead, our research opens a new way for
a variety of applications, including conflict resolution, educational support,
and advanced social psychology studies.

### [9] [Can You Trust an LLM with Your Life-Changing Decision? An Investigation into AI High-Stakes Responses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21132)
*Joshua Adrian Cahyono,Saran Subramanian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在高风险生活建议中的失败模式，包括谄媚和过度自信，并通过实验展示了模型的稳健性和可控性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在高风险建议中缺乏标准保障机制，可能导致误导性回答，亟需研究其失败模式和改进方法。

Method: 通过三项实验评估模型：多选题测试稳健性、自由回答分析安全类型、激活向量操控行为。

Result: 部分模型表现稳健，高分模型通过提问而非直接建议提升安全性，激活操控可直接影响谨慎性。

Conclusion: 需多维度基准测试以确保LLMs在高风险决策中的可信度，激活操控为安全对齐提供新途径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly consulted for high-stakes life
advice, yet they lack standard safeguards against providing confident but
misguided responses. This creates risks of sycophancy and over-confidence. This
paper investigates these failure modes through three experiments: (1) a
multiple-choice evaluation to measure model stability against user pressure;
(2) a free-response analysis using a novel safety typology and an LLM Judge;
and (3) a mechanistic interpretability experiment to steer model behavior by
manipulating a "high-stakes" activation vector. Our results show that while
some models exhibit sycophancy, others like o4-mini remain robust.
Top-performing models achieve high safety scores by frequently asking
clarifying questions, a key feature of a safe, inquisitive approach, rather
than issuing prescriptive advice. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a model's
cautiousness can be directly controlled via activation steering, suggesting a
new path for safety alignment. These findings underscore the need for nuanced,
multi-faceted benchmarks to ensure LLMs can be trusted with life-changing
decisions.

*Miguel Faria,Francisco S. Melo,Ana Paiva*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究了团队协作中顺序决策的可读性，提出了一种多智能体环境下的可读性决策扩展方法，并证明其在团队协作中的优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注单智能体与单人类的交互，忽略了团队协作中可读性决策的潜力。

Method: 提出了一种将可读性决策扩展到多智能体环境的方法。

Result: 实验表明，包含可读性智能体的团队表现优于仅由标准最优行为智能体组成的团队。

Conclusion: 团队协作中引入可读性决策能显著提升性能。

Abstract: In this paper we investigate the notion of legibility in sequential
decision-making in the context of teams and teamwork. There have been works
that extend the notion of legibility to sequential decision making, for
deterministic and for stochastic scenarios. However, these works focus on one
agent interacting with one human, foregoing the benefits of having legible
decision making in teams of agents or in team configurations with humans. In
this work we propose an extension of legible decision-making to multi-agent
settings that improves the performance of agents working in collaboration. We
showcase the performance of legible decision making in team scenarios using our
proposed extension in multi-agent benchmark scenarios. We show that a team with
a legible agent is able to outperform a team composed solely of agents with
standard optimal behaviour.

*Arman Eisenkolb-Vaithyanathan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出两种新指标来量化数独难度，并通过实验验证其与网站标注难度的相关性，最终构建了一个通用的难度评级系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究不同数独网站如何定义数独难度，并提出通用标准以实现跨网站的一致性。

Method: 1. 将数独问题转化为SAT问题，提出基于SAT子句长度分布的指标；2. 模拟人类解题策略，提出基于回溯算法中策略使用次数的指标。

Result: 两种指标与4/5网站的标注难度强相关，构建的通用评级系统能有效分类数独难度。

Conclusion: 提出的指标和评级系统能跨网站一致地映射数独难度，为初学者提供解题算法。

Abstract: In this paper we try to answer the question "What constitutes Sudoku
difficulty rating across different Sudoku websites?" Using two distinct methods
that can both solve every Sudoku puzzle, I propose two new metrics to
characterize Sudoku difficulty. The first method is based on converting a
Sudoku puzzle into its corresponding Satisfiability (SAT) problem. The first
proposed metric is derived from SAT Clause Length Distribution which captures
the structural complexity of a Sudoku puzzle including the number of given
digits and the cells they are in. The second method simulates human Sudoku
solvers by intertwining four popular Sudoku strategies within a backtracking
algorithm called Nishio. The second metric is computed by counting the number
of times Sudoku strategies are applied within the backtracking iterations of a
randomized Nishio. Using these two metrics, I analyze more than a thousand
Sudoku puzzles across five popular websites to characterize every difficulty
level in each website. I evaluate the relationship between the proposed metrics
and website-labeled difficulty levels using Spearman's rank correlation
coefficient, finding strong correlations for 4 out of 5 websites. I construct a
universal rating system using a simple, unsupervised classifier based on the
two proposed metrics. This rating system is capable of classifying both
individual puzzles and entire difficulty levels from the different Sudoku
websites into three categories - Universal Easy, Universal Medium, and
Universal Hard - thereby enabling consistent difficulty mapping across Sudoku
websites. The experimental results show that for 4 out of 5 Sudoku websites,
the universal classification aligns well with website-labeled difficulty
levels. Finally, I present an algorithm that can be used by early Sudoku
practitioners to solve Sudoku puzzles.

*McNair Shah,Saleena Angeline,Adhitya Rajendra Kumar,Naitik Chheda,Kevin Zhu,Vasu Sharma,Sean O'Brien,Will Cai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多维框架，用于探测和引导大型语言模型中的有害内容，通过55个有害子概念的线性探针，发现有害子空间具有低秩特性，并验证了主导方向引导能有效减少有害性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型的发展，理解和可靠地抑制其有害行为的需求日益迫切。

Method: 为55个有害子概念学习线性探针，构建有害子空间，并通过子空间消融和主导方向引导进行实验。

Result: 主导方向引导能几乎消除有害性，同时对模型实用性影响较小。

Conclusion: 概念子空间为理解大型语言模型行为提供了可扩展的视角，并为社区提供了审计和强化未来语言模型的实用工具。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have intensified the need to
understand and reliably curb their harmful behaviours. We introduce a
multidimensional framework for probing and steering harmful content in model
internals. For each of 55 distinct harmfulness subconcepts (e.g., racial hate,
employment scams, weapons), we learn a linear probe, yielding 55 interpretable
directions in activation space. Collectively, these directions span a
harmfulness subspace that we show is strikingly low-rank. We then test ablation
of the entire subspace from model internals, as well as steering and ablation
in the subspace's dominant direction. We find that dominant direction steering
allows for near elimination of harmfulness with a low decrease in utility. Our
findings advance the emerging view that concept subspaces provide a scalable
lens on LLM behaviour and offer practical tools for the community to audit and
harden future generations of language models.

### [13] [Adaptive XAI in High Stakes Environments: Modeling Swift Trust with Multimodal Feedback in Human AI Teams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21158)
*Nishani Fernando,Bahareh Nakisa,Adnan Ahmad,Mohammad Naim Rastgoo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应可解释AI框架（AXTF），通过实时监测用户的认知和情绪状态，动态调整解释内容，以在高压环境中促进人机协作的快速信任。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在紧急响应等高压力场景中，现有XAI方法的统一解释和显式反馈机制不实用，需要一种非侵入式的自适应解释框架以增强信任。

Method: 利用EEG、ECG和眼动追踪等生理和行为信号，构建多目标个性化信任估计模型，动态调整解释内容。

Result: AXTF框架通过实时响应用户状态，提供个性化解释支持，促进快速信任。

Conclusion: AXTF为高压、时间敏感环境中的自适应XAI系统开发奠定了基础。

Abstract: Effective human-AI teaming heavily depends on swift trust, particularly in
high-stakes scenarios such as emergency response, where timely and accurate
decision-making is critical. In these time-sensitive and cognitively demanding
settings, adaptive explainability is essential for fostering trust between
human operators and AI systems. However, existing explainable AI (XAI)
approaches typically offer uniform explanations and rely heavily on explicit
feedback mechanisms, which are often impractical in such high-pressure
scenarios. To address this gap, we propose a conceptual framework for adaptive
XAI that operates non-intrusively by responding to users' real-time cognitive
and emotional states through implicit feedback, thereby enhancing swift trust
in high-stakes environments. The proposed adaptive explainability trust
framework (AXTF) leverages physiological and behavioral signals, such as EEG,
ECG, and eye tracking, to infer user states and support explanation adaptation.
At its core is a multi-objective, personalized trust estimation model that maps
workload, stress, and emotion to dynamic trust estimates. These estimates guide
the modulation of explanation features enabling responsive and personalized
support that promotes swift trust in human-AI collaboration. This conceptual
framework establishes a foundation for developing adaptive, non-intrusive XAI
systems tailored to the rigorous demands of high-pressure, time-sensitive
environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的自动化建模与优化方法，用于解决分布式能源资源在主动配电网（ADN）中的调度问题，通过多LLM协作架构简化了技术门槛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式能源资源在主动配电网中的广泛应用导致调度需求增加，但新接入的运营商缺乏专业知识，依赖人工专家成本高且耗时。

Method: 将ADN调度问题分解为多个阶段，设计了一个包含信息提取器、问题构建器和代码编程器的多LLM协作架构，并针对每个LLM代理开发了优化技术。

Result: 通过用户友好的自然语言查询界面，ADN运营商能够高效生成调度策略，测试案例验证了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著降低了技术门槛，提高了调度效率，为ADN的智能灵活调度提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The increasing penetration of distributed energy resources into active
distribution networks (ADNs) has made effective ADN dispatch imperative.
However, the numerous newly-integrated ADN operators, such as distribution
system aggregators, virtual power plant managers, and end prosumers, often lack
specialized expertise in power system operation, modeling, optimization, and
programming. This knowledge gap renders reliance on human experts both costly
and time-intensive. To address this challenge and enable intelligent, flexible
ADN dispatch, this paper proposes a large language model (LLM) powered
automated modeling and optimization approach. First, the ADN dispatch problems
are decomposed into sequential stages, and a multi-LLM coordination
architecture is designed. This framework comprises an Information Extractor, a
Problem Formulator, and a Code Programmer, tasked with information retrieval,
optimization problem formulation, and code implementation, respectively.
Afterwards, tailored refinement techniques are developed for each LLM agent,
greatly improving the accuracy and reliability of generated content. The
proposed approach features a user-centric interface that enables ADN operators
to derive dispatch strategies via simple natural language queries, eliminating
technical barriers and increasing efficiency. Comprehensive comparisons and
end-to-end demonstrations on various test cases validate the effectiveness of
the proposed architecture and methods.

Conclusion: 论文为风险的本体论分类提供了新视角，未来工作将进一步探讨风险的必要条件。

Abstract: The paper explores the nature of risk, providing a characterization using the
categories of the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO). It argues that the category Risk
is a subclass of BFO:Role, contrasting it with a similar view classifying Risk
as a subclass of BFO:Disposition. This modeling choice is applied on one
example of risk, which represents objects, processes (both physical and mental)
and their interrelations, then generalizing from the instances in the example
to obtain an overall analysis of risk, making explicit what are the sufficient
conditions for being a risk. Plausible necessary conditions are also mentioned
for future work. Index Terms: ontology, risk, BFO, role, disposition

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学LLM存在偏见和不公平问题，需在临床应用前识别并缓解这些偏见。

Method: 结合知识图谱和辅助LLM，采用对抗扰动技术和多跳表征来系统评估LLM的偏见。

Result: 在三个数据集、六个LLM和五种偏见类型上的实验表明，该框架比基线方法更能揭示复杂偏见模式。

Conclusion: 该框架在揭示医学LLM偏见方面具有显著优势和可扩展性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) that are used in medical applications are known
to show biased and unfair patterns. Prior to adopting these in clinical
decision-making applications, it is crucial to identify these bias patterns to
enable effective mitigation of their impact. In this study, we present a novel
framework combining knowledge graphs (KGs) with auxiliary LLMs to
systematically reveal complex bias patterns in medical LLMs. Specifically, the
proposed approach integrates adversarial perturbation techniques to identify
subtle bias patterns. The approach adopts a customized multi-hop
characterization of KGs to enhance the systematic evaluation of arbitrary LLMs.
Through a series of comprehensive experiments (on three datasets, six LLMs, and
five bias types), we show that our proposed framework has noticeably greater
ability and scalability to reveal complex biased patterns of LLMs compared to
other baselines.

Abstract: The emergence of AI agents powered by large language models (LLMs) marks a
pivotal shift toward the Agentic Web, a new phase of the internet defined by
autonomous, goal-driven interactions. In this paradigm, agents interact
directly with one another to plan, coordinate, and execute complex tasks on
behalf of users. This transition from human-driven to machine-to-machine
interaction allows intent to be delegated, relieving users from routine digital
operations and enabling a more interactive, automated web experience. In this
paper, we present a structured framework for understanding and building the
Agentic Web. We trace its evolution from the PC and Mobile Web eras and
identify the core technological foundations that support this shift. Central to
our framework is a conceptual model consisting of three key dimensions:
intelligence, interaction, and economics. These dimensions collectively enable
the capabilities of AI agents, such as retrieval, recommendation, planning, and
collaboration. We analyze the architectural and infrastructural challenges
involved in creating scalable agentic systems, including communication
protocols, orchestration strategies, and emerging paradigms such as the Agent
Attention Economy. We conclude by discussing the potential applications,
societal risks, and governance issues posed by agentic systems, and outline
research directions for developing open, secure, and intelligent ecosystems
shaped by both human intent and autonomous agent behavior. A continuously

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在组合性解释问题并将其映射为SPARQL查询方面的能力，发现其表现随问题复杂度增加而显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在语言解释过程中是否具有系统性组合能力，即能否从已知的原子部分推断复杂结构的含义。

Method: 基于DBpedia的图模式生成三个难度不同的数据集，使用Lemon lexica进行语言化，通过不同提示和优化技术（如few-shot和微调）测试LLMs的表现。

Result: 实验显示，随着问题偏离优化样本，性能（宏F1分数）从0.45降至0.09；即使提供全部信息，最低复杂度数据集的F1分数也不超过0.57。

Conclusion: LLMs在系统性和组合性解释问题并生成SPARQL查询方面存在困难。

Abstract: Language interpretation is a compositional process, in which the meaning of
more complex linguistic structures is inferred from the meaning of their parts.
Large language models possess remarkable language interpretation capabilities
and have been successfully applied to interpret questions by mapping them to
SPARQL queries. An open question is how systematic this interpretation process
is. Toward this question, in this paper, we propose a benchmark for
investigating to what extent the abilities of LLMs to interpret questions are
actually compositional. For this, we generate three datasets of varying
difficulty based on graph patterns in DBpedia, relying on Lemon lexica for
verbalization. Our datasets are created in a very controlled fashion in order
to test the ability of LLMs to interpret structurally complex questions, given
that they have seen the atomic building blocks. This allows us to evaluate to
what degree LLMs are able to interpret complex questions for which they
"understand" the atomic parts. We conduct experiments with models of different
sizes using both various prompt and few-shot optimization techniques as well as
fine-tuning. Our results show that performance in terms of macro $F_1$ degrades
from $0.45$ over $0.26$ down to $0.09$ with increasing deviation from the
samples optimized on. Even when all necessary information was provided to the
model in the input, the $F_1$ scores do not exceed $0.57$ for the dataset of
lowest complexity. We thus conclude that LLMs struggle to systematically and
compositionally interpret questions and map them into SPARQL queries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将LLM的推理和训练任务分离部署，导致资源浪费和延迟适应新数据。

Method: LeMix整合离线分析、执行预测和运行时调度，动态分配资源。

Result: LeMix提升吞吐量3.53倍，减少推理损失0.61倍，响应时间达标率提高2.12倍。

Conclusion: LeMix首次实现LLM推理与训练的联合优化，为高效部署LLM提供了新思路。

Abstract: Modern deployment of large language models (LLMs) frequently involves both
inference serving and continuous retraining to stay aligned with evolving data
and user feedback. Common practices separate these workloads onto distinct
servers in isolated phases, causing substantial inefficiencies (e.g., GPU
idleness) and delayed adaptation to new data in distributed settings. Our
empirical analysis reveals that these inefficiencies stem from dynamic request
arrivals during serving and workload heterogeneity in pipeline-parallel
training. To address these challenges, we propose LeMix, a system for
co-locating and managing concurrent LLM serving and training workloads. LeMix
integrates offline profiling, execution prediction mechanisms, and runtime
scheduling to dynamically adapt resource allocation based on workload
characteristics and system conditions. By understanding task-specific behaviors
and co-execution interference across shared nodes, LeMix improves utilization
and serving quality without compromising serving responsiveness. Our evaluation
shows that LeMix improves throughput by up to 3.53x, reduces inference loss by
up to 0.61x, and delivers up to 2.12x higher response time SLO attainment over
traditional separate setups. To our knowledge, this is the first work to
uncover and exploit the opportunities of joint LLM inference and training,
paving the way for more resource-efficient deployment of LLMs in production
environments.

Result: 微调LLM在生成有用澄清问题上优于零样本提示，用户研究显示其生成的代码更准确。

Conclusion: 该编码助手通过生成澄清问题，显著提升了代码生成的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as coding assistants.
However, the ambiguity of the developer's prompt often leads to incorrect code
generation, as current models struggle to infer user intent without extensive
prompt engineering or external context. This work aims to build an LLM-based
coding assistant that mimics the human code review process by asking
clarification questions when faced with ambiguous or under-specified queries.
  Our end-to-end system includes (1) a query classifier trained to detect
unclear programming-related queries and (2) a fine-tuned LLM that generates
clarification questions. Our evaluation shows that the fine-tuned LLM
outperforms standard zero-shot prompting in generating useful clarification
questions. Furthermore, our user study indicates that users find the
clarification questions generated by our model to outperform the baseline,
demonstrating that our coding assistant produces more accurate and helpful code
responses compared to baseline coding assistants.

Result: 初步评估显示幻觉率显著降低，推理过程透明度提高。

Conclusion: 该框架为开发更可靠的问答系统提供了重要进展，尽管在区分可信信息和平衡系统延迟方面仍有挑战。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Language Models (RALMs) face significant challenges in
reducing factual errors, particularly in document relevance evaluation and
knowledge integration. We introduce a framework for structured relevance
assessment that enhances RALM robustness through improved document evaluation,
balanced intrinsic and external knowledge integration, and effective handling
of unanswerable queries. Our approach employs a multi-dimensional scoring
system that considers both semantic matching and source reliability, utilizing
embedding-based relevance scoring and synthetic training data with
mixed-quality documents. We implement specialized benchmarking on niche topics,
a knowledge integration mechanism, and an "unknown" response protocol for
queries with insufficient knowledge coverage. Preliminary evaluations
demonstrate significant reductions in hallucination rates and improved
transparency in reasoning processes. Our framework advances the development of
more reliable question-answering systems capable of operating effectively in
dynamic environments with variable data quality. While challenges persist in
accurately distinguishing credible information and balancing system latency
with thoroughness, this work represents a meaningful step toward enhancing RALM
reliability.

Result: AI工具将任务速度提升10倍，交互式条件准确性更高，预计可节省268小时。标注者技能对结果有显著影响。

Conclusion: 交互式AI工具能显著提升复杂任务的效率和准确性，标注者技能是关键因素。

Abstract: We utilize a within-subjects design with randomized task assignments to
understand the effectiveness of using an AI retrieval augmented generation
(RAG) tool to assist analysts with an information extraction and data
annotation task. We replicate an existing, challenging real-world annotation
task with complex multi-part criteria on a set of thousands of pages of public
disclosure documents from global systemically important banks (GSIBs) with
heterogeneous and incomplete information content. We test two treatment
conditions. First, a "naive" AI use condition in which annotators use only the
tool and must accept the first answer they are given. And second, an
"interactive" AI treatment condition where annotators use the tool
interactively, and use their judgement to follow-up with additional information
if necessary. Compared to the human-only baseline, the use of the AI tool
accelerated task execution by up to a factor of 10 and enhanced task accuracy,
particularly in the interactive condition. We find that when extrapolated to
the full task, these methods could save up to 268 hours compared to the
human-only approach. Additionally, our findings suggest that annotator skill,
not just with the subject matter domain, but also with AI tools, is a factor in
both the accuracy and speed of task performance.

Result: 该模型通过局部和全局协同作用，满足了供应链管理中适应性和效率的双重需求。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了现有方法的空白，为动态高效的供应链管理提供了创新解决方案。

Abstract: Supply chain management faces significant challenges, including demand
fluctuations, inventory imbalances, and amplified upstream order variability
due to the bullwhip effect. Traditional methods, such as simple moving
averages, struggle to address dynamic market conditions. Emerging machine
learning techniques, including LSTM, reinforcement learning, and XGBoost, offer
potential solutions but are limited by computational complexity, training
inefficiencies, or constraints in time-series modeling. Liquid Neural Networks,
inspired by dynamic biological systems, present a promising alternative due to
their adaptability, low computational cost, and robustness to noise, making
them suitable for real-time decision-making and edge computing. Despite their
success in applications like autonomous vehicles and medical monitoring, their
potential in supply chain optimization remains underexplored. This study
introduces a hybrid LNN and XGBoost model to optimize ordering strategies in
multi-tier supply chains. By leveraging LNN's dynamic feature extraction and
XGBoost's global optimization capabilities, the model aims to mitigate the
bullwhip effect and enhance cumulative profitability. The research investigates
how local and global synergies within the hybrid framework address the dual
demands of adaptability and efficiency in SCM. The proposed approach fills a
critical gap in existing methodologies, offering an innovative solution for
dynamic and efficient supply chain management.

Result: Qwen-2.5-7B模型在自动评估指标上优于o3-mini 18%，人类评估中其提问和最终方案分别获得42%和28%的偏好。

Conclusion: 主动澄清问题能显著提升LLMs的协作能力，使其从被动文本生成器转变为真正的协作伙伴。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to function as
collaborative partners, engaging in back-and-forth dialogue to solve complex,
ambiguous problems. However, current LLMs often falter in real-world settings,
defaulting to passive responses or narrow clarifications when faced with
incomplete or under-specified prompts, falling short of proactively gathering
the missing information that is crucial for high-quality solutions. In this
work, we introduce a new task paradigm: proactive information gathering, where
LLMs must identify gaps in the provided context and strategically elicit
implicit user knowledge through targeted questions. To systematically study and
train this capability, we design a scalable framework that generates partially
specified, real-world tasks, masking key information and simulating authentic
ambiguity. Within this setup, our core innovation is a reinforcement finetuning
strategy that rewards questions that elicit genuinely new, implicit user
information -- such as hidden domain expertise or fine-grained requirements --
that would otherwise remain unspoken. Experiments demonstrate that our trained
Qwen-2.5-7B model significantly outperforms o3-mini by 18% on automatic
evaluation metrics. More importantly, human evaluation reveals that
clarification questions and final outlines generated by our model are favored
by human annotators by 42% and 28% respectively. Together, these results
highlight the value of proactive clarification in elevating LLMs from passive
text generators to genuinely collaborative thought partners.

Motivation: 在问答任务中，确定何时信任大语言模型的输出至关重要。传统方法（如语义熵）通过设定阈值衡量语义等价关系，但缺乏对语义关系连续性的捕捉。

Method: 提出了一种基于Shapley的不确定性度量框架，通过连续捕捉语义关系，并验证其满足三个基本性质。

Result: 实验表明，Shapley不确定性比基线方法更能准确预测大语言模型在问答和其他数据集上的表现。

Conclusion: Shapley不确定性提供了一种更精细的语义不确定性度量方法，优于传统基于阈值的方法。

Abstract: In question-answering tasks, determining when to trust the outputs is crucial
to the alignment of large language models (LLMs). Kuhn et al. (2023) introduces
semantic entropy as a measure of uncertainty, by incorporating linguistic
invariances from the same meaning. It primarily relies on setting threshold to
measure the level of semantic equivalence relation. We propose a more nuanced
framework that extends beyond such thresholding by developing a Shapley-based
uncertainty metric that captures the continuous nature of semantic
relationships. We establish three fundamental properties that characterize
valid uncertainty metrics and prove that our Shapley uncertainty satisfies
these criteria. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our Shapley
uncertainty more accurately predicts LLM performance in question-answering and
other datasets, compared to similar baseline measures.

Abstract: Autonomous agents based on large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
impressive capabilities in a wide range of applications, including web
navigation, software development, and embodied control. While most LLMs are
limited in several key agentic procedures, such as reliable planning, long-term
memory, tool management, and multi-agent coordination, graphs can serve as a
powerful auxiliary structure to enhance structure, continuity, and coordination
in complex agent workflows. Given the rapid growth and fragmentation of
research on Graph-augmented LLM Agents (GLA), this paper offers a timely and
comprehensive overview of recent advances and also highlights key directions
for future work. Specifically, we categorize existing GLA methods by their
primary functions in LLM agent systems, including planning, memory, and tool
usage, and then analyze how graphs and graph learning algorithms contribute to
each. For multi-agent systems, we further discuss how GLA solutions facilitate
the orchestration, efficiency optimization, and trustworthiness of MAS.
Finally, we highlight key future directions to advance this field, from
improving structural adaptability to enabling unified, scalable, and multimodal
GLA systems. We hope this paper can serve as a roadmap for future research on
GLA and foster a deeper understanding of the role of graphs in LLM agent
systems.

Motivation: 解决本体和知识图谱手动维护的高成本问题，利用LLM的非结构化知识但保持结构化一致性。

Method: 采用双解码器框架，一个生成本体编辑候选，另一个生成自然语言解释，并通过动态注意力门控机制协调。

Result: 在医疗本体细化、语义搜索改进等用例中表现优于仅结构化或非结构化解码的基线。

Conclusion: Evo-DKD结合符号和神经推理，为LLM驱动的知识库维护提供了新范式。

Abstract: Ontologies and knowledge graphs require continuous evolution to remain
comprehensive and accurate, but manual curation is labor intensive. Large
Language Models (LLMs) possess vast unstructured knowledge but struggle with
maintaining structured consistency. We propose Evo-DKD, a novel dual-decoder
framework for autonomous ontology evolution that combines structured ontology
traversal with unstructured text reasoning. Evo-DKD introduces two parallel
decoding streams within an LLM: one decoder generates candidate ontology edits
(e.g., new concepts or relations) while the other produces natural-language
justifications. A dynamic attention-based gating mechanism coordinates the two
streams, deciding at each step how to blend structured and unstructured
knowledge. Due to GPU constraints, we simulate the dual-decoder behavior using
prompt-based mode control to approximate coordinated decoding in a
single-stream mode. The system operates in a closed reasoning loop: proposed
ontology edits are validated (via consistency checks and cross-verification
with the text explanations) and then injected into the knowledge base, which in
turn informs subsequent reasoning. We demonstrate Evo-DKD's effectiveness on
use cases including healthcare ontology refinement, semantic search
improvement, and cultural heritage timeline modeling. Experiments show that
Evo-DKD outperforms baselines using structured-only or unstructured-only
decoding in both precision of ontology updates and downstream task performance.
We present quantitative metrics and qualitative examples, confirming the
contributions of the dual-decoder design and gating router. Evo-DKD offers a
new paradigm for LLM-driven knowledge base maintenance, combining the strengths
of symbolic and neural reasoning for sustainable ontology evolution.

pharmacogenomics, to validate its performance on key response metrics. Sherpa
Rx integrated Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC)
guidelines with Pharmacogenomics Knowledgebase (PharmGKB) data to generate

additionally incorporated PharmGKB content. Responses were scored on accuracy,
relevance, clarity, completeness (5-point Likert scale), and recall. Wilcoxon
signed-rank tests compared accuracy between Phase 1 and Phase 2, and between
Phase 2 and ChatGPT-4omini. A 20-question quiz assessed the tool's real-world
applicability against other models. In Phase 1 (N=260), Sherpa Rx demonstrated
high performance of accuracy 4.9, relevance 5.0, clarity 5.0, completeness 4.8,
and recall 0.99. The subset analysis (N=20) showed improvements in accuracy
(4.6 vs. 4.4, Phase 2 vs. Phase 1 subset) and completeness (5.0 vs. 4.8).
ChatGPT-4omini performed comparably in relevance (5.0) and clarity (4.9) but
lagged in accuracy (3.9) and completeness (4.2). Differences in accuracy
between Phase 1 and Phase 2 was not statistically significant. However, Phase 2
significantly outperformed ChatGPT-4omini. On the 20-question quiz, Sherpa Rx
achieved 90% accuracy, outperforming other models. Integrating additional
resources like CPIC and PharmGKB with RAG enhances AI accuracy and performance.
This study highlights the transformative potential of generative AI like Sherpa
Rx in pharmacogenomics, improving decision-making with accurate, personalized
responses.

### [31] [An LLM Driven Agent Framework for Automated Infrared Spectral Multi Task Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21471)
*Zujie Xie,Zixuan Chen,Jiheng Liang,Xiangyang Yu,Ziru Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 利用大型语言模型（LLM）驱动的框架，在低数据条件下实现红外光谱的自动分析，性能优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 红外光谱分析面临高维度和重叠谱带的挑战，传统方法难以应对，而LLM的泛化和推理能力为自动化科学工作流提供了新思路。

Method: 提出端到端的LLM驱动框架，整合文献知识库、光谱预处理、特征提取和多任务推理，通过多轮闭环协议动态优化预测。

Result: 在多种材料数据集上，多轮LLM推理性能优于单轮推理，并在低数据条件下媲美或超越机器学习和深度学习模型。

Conclusion: LLM驱动的框架为低数据条件下的红外光谱分析提供了高效、自动化的解决方案，展现了LLM在科学领域的潜力。

Abstract: Infrared spectroscopy offers rapid, non destructive measurement of chemical
and material properties but suffers from high dimensional, overlapping spectral
bands that challenge conventional chemometric approaches. Emerging large
language models (LLMs), with their capacity for generalization and reasoning,
offer promising potential for automating complex scientific workflows. Despite
this promise, their application in IR spectral analysis remains largely
unexplored. This study addresses the critical challenge of achieving accurate,
automated infrared spectral interpretation under low-data conditions using an
LLM-driven framework. We introduce an end-to-end, large language model driven
agent framework that integrates a structured literature knowledge base,
automated spectral preprocessing, feature extraction, and multi task reasoning
in a unified pipeline. By querying a curated corpus of peer reviewed IR
publications, the agent selects scientifically validated routines. The selected
methods transform each spectrum into low dimensional feature sets, which are
fed into few shot prompt templates for classification, regression, and anomaly
detection. A closed loop, multi turn protocol iteratively appends mispredicted
samples to the prompt, enabling dynamic refinement of predictions. Across
diverse materials: stamp pad ink, Chinese medicine, Pu'er tea, Citri
Reticulatae Pericarpium and waste water COD datasets, the multi turn LLM
consistently outperforms single turn inference, rivaling or exceeding machine
learning and deep learning models under low data regimes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的强化学习基准（如游戏）难以直接应用于现实世界的辅助机器人任务，需要多样化的基准来应对复杂交互场景。

Method: Assistax利用JAX的硬件加速技术，显著提升物理模拟中的学习速度，并采用多智能体强化学习训练多样化的伙伴智能体。

Result: Assistax在向量化训练中比CPU方案快370倍，并为连续控制和多智能体强化学习算法提供了可靠的基线。

Conclusion: Assistax是一个实用的基准，有助于推动辅助机器人领域的强化学习研究。

Abstract: The development of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms has been largely
driven by ambitious challenge tasks and benchmarks. Games have dominated RL
benchmarks because they present relevant challenges, are inexpensive to run and
easy to understand. While games such as Go and Atari have led to many
breakthroughs, they often do not directly translate to real-world embodied
applications. In recognising the need to diversify RL benchmarks and addressing
complexities that arise in embodied interaction scenarios, we introduce
Assistax: an open-source benchmark designed to address challenges arising in
assistive robotics tasks. Assistax uses JAX's hardware acceleration for
significant speed-ups for learning in physics-based simulations. In terms of
open-loop wall-clock time, Assistax runs up to $370\times$ faster when
vectorising training runs compared to CPU-based alternatives. Assistax
conceptualises the interaction between an assistive robot and an active human
patient using multi-agent RL to train a population of diverse partner agents
against which an embodied robotic agent's zero-shot coordination capabilities
can be tested. Extensive evaluation and hyperparameter tuning for popular
continuous control RL and MARL algorithms provide reliable baselines and
establish Assistax as a practical benchmark for advancing RL research for
assistive robotics. The code is available at:

Motivation: 开发能准确模拟个人决策的AI系统，以促进人机协作与理解，但现有方法需要大量个人数据，不实用。

Method: 采用两阶段优化：1. 丰富化步骤，通过原型增强模型连接群体与个体行为建模；2. 民主化步骤，利用能力水平或用户原型以最少数据初始化并优化个体嵌入。

Result: Maia4All仅需20局棋局即可高精度预测个人走棋和行为模式，数据效率显著优于以往需5000局的方法。

Conclusion: Maia4All为个性化AI行为建模树立新标准，其原型增强模型方法可扩展至其他领域，如个性化LLMs。

Abstract: As humans seek to collaborate with, learn from, and better understand
artificial intelligence systems, developing AIs that can accurately emulate
individual decision-making becomes increasingly important. Chess, a
long-standing AI benchmark with precise skill measurement, offers an ideal
testbed for human-AI alignment. However, existing approaches to modeling human
behavior require prohibitively large amounts of data from each individual,
making them impractical for new or sparsely represented users. In this work, we
introduce Maia4All, a framework designed to learn and adapt to individual
decision-making styles efficiently, even with limited data. Maia4All achieves
this through a two-stage optimization process: (1) an enrichment step, which
bridges population and individual-level human behavior modeling with a
prototype-enriched model, and (2) a democratization step, which leverages
ability levels or user prototypes to initialize and refine individual
embeddings with minimal data. Our experimental results show that Maia4All can
accurately predict individual moves and profile behavioral patterns with high
fidelity, establishing a new standard for personalized human-like AI behavior
modeling in chess. Maia4All achieves individual human behavior modeling in
chess with only 20 games, compared to the 5,000 games required previously,
representing a significant improvement in data efficiency. Our work provides an
example of how population AI systems can flexibly adapt to individual users
using a prototype-enriched model as a bridge. This approach extends beyond
chess, as shown in our case study on idiosyncratic LLMs, highlighting its
potential for broader applications in personalized AI adaptation.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何利用大语言模型（LLMs）解决供应链管理中的决策挑战，减少决策时间并提高效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 供应链管理的决策过程复杂且耗时，传统优化技术需要人工解释和调整，LLMs的出现为解决这些问题提供了新途径。

Method: 应用LLMs技术，自动化解释工具结果、分析场景和更新数学模型，减少对数据科学团队的依赖。

Result: 决策时间从数天或数周缩短至数分钟或数小时，显著提高了规划者和高管的效率。

Conclusion: LLMs技术能够民主化供应链工具，大幅提升决策速度和生产力。

Abstract: Supply Chain Management requires addressing a variety of complex
decision-making challenges, from sourcing strategies to planning and execution.
Over the last few decades, advances in computation and information technologies
have enabled the transition from manual, intuition and experience-based
decision-making, into more automated and data-driven decisions using a variety
of tools that apply optimization techniques. These techniques use mathematical
methods to improve decision-making.
  Unfortunately, business planners and executives still need to spend
considerable time and effort to (i) understand and explain the recommendations
coming out of these technologies; (ii) analyze various scenarios and answer
what-if questions; and (iii) update the mathematical models used in these tools
to reflect current business environments. Addressing these challenges requires
involving data science teams and/or the technology providers to explain results
or make the necessary changes in the technology and hence significantly slows
down decision making.
  Motivated by the recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), we report
how this disruptive technology can democratize supply chain technology -
namely, facilitate the understanding of tools' outcomes, as well as the
interaction with supply chain tools without human-in-the-loop. Specifically, we
report how we apply LLMs to address the three challenges described above, thus
substantially reducing the time to decision from days and weeks to minutes and
hours as well as dramatically increasing planners' and executives' productivity
and impact.

Motivation: 尽管MLLMs在视觉语言任务中取得进展，但其在面对不可回答问题时可能产生不可信内容，这一问题尚未被充分研究。

Method: 定义了四类视觉不可回答问题，构建了包含12k+样本的MoHoBench基准，评估了28种MLLMs的诚实行为，并尝试了监督学习和偏好学习对齐方法。

Result: 研究发现大多数模型无法在必要时拒绝回答，且诚实行为受视觉信息影响，需要专门的多模态对齐方法。

Conclusion: 论文为未来可信MLLMs的研究提供了基准和方法基础，数据与代码已开源。

Abstract: Recently Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved considerable
advancements in vision-language tasks, yet produce potentially harmful or
untrustworthy content. Despite substantial work investigating the
trustworthiness of language models, MMLMs' capability to act honestly,
especially when faced with visually unanswerable questions, remains largely
underexplored. This work presents the first systematic assessment of honesty
behaviors across various MLLMs. We ground honesty in models' response behaviors
to unanswerable visual questions, define four representative types of such
questions, and construct MoHoBench, a large-scale MMLM honest benchmark,
consisting of 12k+ visual question samples, whose quality is guaranteed by
multi-stage filtering and human verification. Using MoHoBench, we benchmarked
the honesty of 28 popular MMLMs and conducted a comprehensive analysis. Our
findings show that: (1) most models fail to appropriately refuse to answer when
necessary, and (2) MMLMs' honesty is not solely a language modeling issue, but
is deeply influenced by visual information, necessitating the development of
dedicated methods for multimodal honesty alignment. Therefore, we implemented
initial alignment methods using supervised and preference learning to improve
honesty behavior, providing a foundation for future work on trustworthy MLLMs.

Conclusion: 为研究神经网络的世界模型提供了理论基础和实验框架。

Abstract: We propose a set of precise criteria for saying a neural net learns and uses
a "world model." The goal is to give an operational meaning to terms that are
often used informally, in order to provide a common language for experimental
investigation. We focus specifically on the idea of representing a latent
"state space" of the world, leaving modeling the effect of actions to future
work. Our definition is based on ideas from the linear probing literature, and
formalizes the notion of a computation that factors through a representation of
the data generation process. An essential addition to the definition is a set
of conditions to check that such a "world model" is not a trivial consequence
of the neural net's data or task.

Result: 在AIOZ-GDance数据集上，ST-GDance表现优于现有方法，尤其在生成长且连贯的群体舞蹈序列时。

Conclusion: ST-GDance通过高效时空建模，解决了群体舞蹈生成的复杂性和碰撞问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Group dance generation from music has broad applications in film, gaming, and
animation production. However, it requires synchronizing multiple dancers while
maintaining spatial coordination. As the number of dancers and sequence length
increase, this task faces higher computational complexity and a greater risk of
motion collisions. Existing methods often struggle to model dense
spatial-temporal interactions, leading to scalability issues and multi-dancer
collisions. To address these challenges, we propose ST-GDance, a novel
framework that decouples spatial and temporal dependencies to optimize
long-term and collision-free group choreography. We employ lightweight graph
convolutions for distance-aware spatial modeling and accelerated sparse
attention for efficient temporal modeling. This design significantly reduces
computational costs while ensuring smooth and collision-free interactions.
Experiments on the AIOZ-GDance dataset demonstrate that ST-GDance outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in generating long and coherent group
dance sequences. Project page: https://yilliajing.github.io/ST-GDance-Website/.

Conclusion: 个性化解释方法有助于提升AI透明度和用户体验。

Abstract: The need for explanations in AI has, by and large, been driven by the desire
to increase the transparency of black-box machine learning models. However,
such explanations, which focus on the internal mechanisms that lead to a
specific output, are often unsuitable for non-experts. To facilitate a
human-centered perspective on AI explanations, agents need to focus on
individuals and their preferences as well as the context in which the
explanations are given. This paper proposes a personalized approach to
explanation, where the agent tailors the information provided to the user based
on what is most likely pertinent to them. We propose a model of the agent's
worldview that also serves as a personal and dynamic memory of its previous
interactions with the same user, based on which the artificial agent can
estimate what part of its knowledge is most likely new information to the user.

Abstract: In this work, we study how vision-language models (VLMs) can be utilized to
enhance the safety for the autonomous driving system, including perception,
situational understanding, and path planning. However, existing research has
largely overlooked the evaluation of these models in traffic safety-critical
driving scenarios. To bridge this gap, we create the benchmark (SafeDrive228K)
and propose a new baseline based on VLM with knowledge graph-based
retrieval-augmented generation (SafeDriveRAG) for visual question answering
(VQA). Specifically, we introduce SafeDrive228K, the first large-scale
multimodal question-answering benchmark comprising 228K examples across 18
sub-tasks. This benchmark encompasses a diverse range of traffic safety
queries, from traffic accidents and corner cases to common safety knowledge,
enabling a thorough assessment of the comprehension and reasoning abilities of
the models. Furthermore, we propose a plug-and-play multimodal knowledge
graph-based retrieval-augmented generation approach that employs a novel
multi-scale subgraph retrieval algorithm for efficient information retrieval.
By incorporating traffic safety guidelines collected from the Internet, this
framework further enhances the model's capacity to handle safety-critical
situations. Finally, we conduct comprehensive evaluations on five mainstream
VLMs to assess their reliability in safety-sensitive driving tasks.
Experimental results demonstrate that integrating RAG significantly improves
performance, achieving a +4.73% gain in Traffic Accidents tasks, +8.79% in
Corner Cases tasks and +14.57% in Traffic Safety Commonsense across five
mainstream VLMs, underscoring the potential of our proposed benchmark and
methodology for advancing research in traffic safety. Our source code and data

Abstract: Audio-visual multi-task incremental learning aims to continuously learn from
multiple audio-visual tasks without the need for joint training on all tasks.
The challenge of the problem is how to preserve the old task knowledge while
facilitating the learning of new task with previous experiences. To address
these challenges, we introduce a three-stage Progressive Homeostatic and
Plastic audio-visual prompt (PHP) method. In the shallow phase, we design the
task-shared modality aggregating adapter to foster cross-task and cross-modal
audio-visual representation learning to enhance shared understanding between
tasks. In the middle phase, we propose the task-specific modality-shared
dynamic generating adapter, which constructs prompts that are tailored to
individual tasks while remaining general across modalities, which balances the
models ability to retain knowledge against forgetting with its potential for
versatile multi-task transferability. In the deep phase, we introduce the
task-specific modality-independent prompts to further refine the understand
ability by targeting individual information for each task and modality. By
incorporating these three phases, PHP retains task-specific prompts while
adapting shared parameters for new tasks to effectively balance knowledge
sharing and specificity. Our method achieves SOTA performance in different
orders of four tasks (AVE, AVVP, AVS and AVQA). Our code can be available at

Result: 发现贝叶斯方法未成为现代具身智能的核心，但具备扩展系统至开放物理世界的潜力。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯方法可能在推动具身智能向开放物理世界发展中发挥关键作用。

Abstract: Embodied intelligence posits that cognitive capabilities fundamentally emerge
from - and are shaped by - an agent's real-time sensorimotor interactions with
its environment. Such adaptive behavior inherently requires continuous
inference under uncertainty. Bayesian statistics offers a principled
probabilistic framework to address this challenge by representing knowledge as
probability distributions and updating beliefs in response to new evidence. The
core computational processes underlying embodied intelligence - including
perception, action selection, learning, and even higher-level cognition - can
be effectively understood and modeled as forms of Bayesian inference. Despite
the deep conceptual connection between Bayesian statistics and embodied
intelligence, Bayesian principles have not been widely or explicitly applied in
today's embodied intelligence systems. In this work, we examine both Bayesian
and contemporary embodied intelligence approaches through two fundamental
lenses: search and learning - the two central themes in modern AI, as
highlighted in Rich Sutton's influential essay "The Bitter Lesson". This
analysis sheds light on why Bayesian inference has not played a central role in
the development of modern embodied intelligence. At the same time, it reveals
that current embodied intelligence systems remain largely confined to
closed-physical-world environments, and highlights the potential for Bayesian
methods to play a key role in extending these systems toward truly open
physical-world embodied intelligence.

Conclusion: StaffPro为自动化人员管理提供了鲁棒、可解释且以人为中心的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents integrate pre-trained LLMs with modular
algorithmic components and have shown remarkable reasoning and decision-making
abilities. In this work, we investigate their use for two tightly intertwined
challenges in workforce management: staffing, i.e., the assignment and
scheduling of tasks to workers, which may require team formation; and
profiling, i.e., the continuous estimation of workers' skills, preferences, and
other latent attributes from unstructured data. We cast these problems in a
formal mathematical framework that links scheduling decisions to latent feature
estimation, and we introduce StaffPro, an LLM agent that addresses staffing and
profiling jointly. Differently from existing staffing solutions, StaffPro
allows expressing optimization objectives using natural language, accepts
textual task descriptions and provides high flexibility. StaffPro interacts
directly with humans by establishing a continuous human-agent feedback loop,
ensuring natural and intuitive use. By analyzing human feedback, our agent
continuously estimates the latent features of workers, realizing life-long
worker profiling and ensuring optimal staffing performance over time. A
consulting firm simulation example demonstrates that StaffPro successfully
estimates workers' attributes and generates high quality schedules. With its
innovative design, StaffPro offers a robust, interpretable, and human-centric
solution for automated personnel management.

Motivation: LVLMs在安全性上存在脆弱性，研究旨在理解其内部机制并提出改进方法。

Method: 定义三种关键能力（安全感知、语义理解、对齐表达），并提出SASA技术，通过线性探测增强安全性。

Result: SASA显著提升LVLMs的安全性，同时对实用性影响最小。

Conclusion: 通过模型内部语义理解增强安全性是可行的，SASA为LVLMs提供了一种有效的安全改进方案。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are vulnerable to harmful input compared
to their language-only backbones. We investigated this vulnerability by
exploring LVLMs internal dynamics, framing their inherent safety understanding
in terms of three key capabilities. Specifically, we define these capabilities
as safety perception, semantic understanding, and alignment for linguistic
expression, and experimentally pinpointed their primary locations within the
model architecture. The results indicate that safety perception often emerges
before comprehensive semantic understanding, leading to the reduction in
safety. Motivated by these findings, we propose \textbf{Self-Aware Safety
Augmentation (SASA)}, a technique that projects informative semantic
representations from intermediate layers onto earlier safety-oriented layers.
This approach leverages the model's inherent semantic understanding to enhance
safety recognition without fine-tuning. Then, we employ linear probing to
articulate the model's internal semantic comprehension to detect the risk
before the generation process. Extensive experiments on various datasets and
tasks demonstrate that SASA significantly improves the safety of LVLMs, with
minimal impact on the utility.

Abstract: This paper addresses the question of how able the current trends of
Artificial Intelligence (AI) are in managing to take the responsibility of a
full course of mathematics at a college level. The study evaluates this ability
in four significant aspects, namely, creating a course syllabus, presenting
selected material, answering student questions, and creating an assessment. It
shows that even though the AI is strong in some important parts like
organization and accuracy, there are still some human aspects that are far away
from the current abilities of AI. There is still a hidden emotional part, even
in science, that cannot be fulfilled by the AI in its current state. This paper
suggests some recommendations to integrate the human and AI potentials to
create better outcomes in terms of reaching the target of creating a full
course of mathematics, at a university level, as best as possible.

### [46] [Unrolling Dynamic Programming via Graph Filters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21705)
*Sergio Rozada,Samuel Rey,Gonzalo Mateos,Antonio G. Marques*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为BellNet的新方法，通过将策略迭代展开并截断为可学习的参数模型，以减少计算成本并近似最优策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统动态规划方法在状态-动作空间大或涉及长期依赖时计算成本高，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 将策略迭代展开并截断为可学习的参数模型BellNet，利用图信号处理重新参数化，并最小化Bellman误差。

Result: 初步实验表明，BellNet在网格环境中能以更少的迭代次数有效近似最优策略。

Conclusion: BellNet提供了一种简洁、可转移且统一的策略与值迭代表示，显著降低了推理复杂度。

Abstract: Dynamic programming (DP) is a fundamental tool used across many engineering
fields. The main goal of DP is to solve Bellman's optimality equations for a
given Markov decision process (MDP). Standard methods like policy iteration
exploit the fixed-point nature of these equations to solve them iteratively.
However, these algorithms can be computationally expensive when the
state-action space is large or when the problem involves long-term
dependencies. Here we propose a new approach that unrolls and truncates policy
iterations into a learnable parametric model dubbed BellNet, which we train to
minimize the so-termed Bellman error from random value function
initializations. Viewing the transition probability matrix of the MDP as the
adjacency of a weighted directed graph, we draw insights from graph signal
processing to interpret (and compactly re-parameterize) BellNet as a cascade of
nonlinear graph filters. This fresh look facilitates a concise, transferable,
and unifying representation of policy and value iteration, with an explicit
handle on complexity during inference. Preliminary experiments conducted in a
grid-like environment demonstrate that BellNet can effectively approximate
optimal policies in a fraction of the iterations required by classical methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在跨数据集脑功能分区中假设数据分布一致，难以应对实际场景中的域偏移问题。

Method: 通过构建群体和个体水平的跨数据集脑图，结合半监督训练和对抗优化，将参考图谱从群体水平适应到个体水平。

Result: 实验表明，GDAIP能生成具有拓扑合理边界、跨会话一致性强且能反映功能组织的个体分区。

Conclusion: GDAIP为解决跨数据集脑功能分区中的域偏移问题提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Recent deep learning approaches have shown promise in learning such
individual brain parcellations from functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI). However, most existing methods assume consistent data distributions
across domains and struggle with domain shifts inherent to real-world
cross-dataset scenarios. To address this challenge, we proposed Graph Domain
Adaptation for Individual Parcellation (GDAIP), a novel framework that
integrates Graph Attention Networks (GAT) with Minimax Entropy (MME)-based
domain adaptation. We construct cross-dataset brain graphs at both the group
and individual levels. By leveraging semi-supervised training and adversarial
optimization of the prediction entropy on unlabeled vertices from target brain
graph, the reference atlas is adapted from the group-level brain graph to the
individual brain graph, enabling individual parcellation under cross-dataset
settings. We evaluated our method using parcellation visualization, Dice
coefficient, and functional homogeneity. Experimental results demonstrate that
GDAIP produces individual parcellations with topologically plausible
boundaries, strong cross-session consistency, and ability of reflecting
functional organization.

Conclusion: 有界拟合在ALC及其片段中是一种有效的学习方法，优于其他算法。

Abstract: Bounded fitting is a general paradigm for learning logical formulas from
positive and negative data examples, that has received considerable interest
recently. We investigate bounded fitting for the description logic ALC and its
syntactic fragments. We show that the underlying size-restricted fitting
problem is NP-complete for all studied fragments, even in the special case of a
single positive and a single negative example. By design, bounded fitting comes
with probabilistic guarantees in Valiant's PAC learning framework. In contrast,
we show that other classes of algorithms for learning ALC concepts do not
provide such guarantees. Finally, we present an implementation of bounded
fitting in ALC and its fragments based on a SAT solver. We discuss
optimizations and compare our implementation to other concept learning tools.

Abstract: The rise of generative AI, has driven significant advancements in high-risk
sectors like healthcare and finance. The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
architecture, combining language models (LLMs) with search engines, is
particularly notable for its ability to generate responses from document
corpora. Despite its potential, the reliability of RAG systems in critical
contexts remains a concern, with issues such as hallucinations persisting. This
study evaluates a RAG system used in due diligence for an investment fund. We
propose a robust evaluation protocol combining human annotations and LLM-Judge
annotations to identify system failures, like hallucinations, off-topic, failed
citations, and abstentions. Inspired by the Prediction Powered Inference (PPI)
method, we achieve precise performance measurements with statistical
guarantees. We provide a comprehensive dataset for further analysis. Our
contributions aim to enhance the reliability and scalability of RAG systems

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种混合条件变分因果推断模型（MCVCI）和混合条件变分因果聚类方法（MCVCC），用于解决双变量因果方向识别问题，并在模拟和真实数据上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的观测数据通常来自不同环境，具有异质性因果关系，而现有方法多基于单一因果机制，无法有效处理此类数据。

Method: 结合高斯混合模型和神经网络的拟合能力，利用混合条件变分自编码器的概率边界似然作为因果决策标准，并进一步提出MCVCC方法揭示因果机制表达。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据上，MCVCI和MCVCC方法表现出优于现有方法的综合性能。

Conclusion: MCVCI和MCVCC方法能够有效识别异质性因果关系，为因果推断提供了新工具。

Abstract: Bivariate causal direction identification is a fundamental and vital problem
in the causal inference field. Among binary causal methods, most methods based
on additive noise only use one single causal mechanism to construct a causal
model. In the real world, observations are always collected in different
environments with heterogeneous causal relationships. Therefore, on observation
data, this paper proposes a Mixture Conditional Variational Causal Inference
model (MCVCI) to infer heterogeneous causality. Specifically, according to the
identifiability of the Hybrid Additive Noise Model (HANM), MCVCI combines the
superior fitting capabilities of the Gaussian mixture model and the neural
network and elegantly uses the likelihoods obtained from the probabilistic
bounds of the mixture conditional variational auto-encoder as causal decision
criteria. Moreover, we model the casual heterogeneity into cluster numbers and
propose the Mixture Conditional Variational Causal Clustering (MCVCC) method,
which can reveal causal mechanism expression. Compared with state-of-the-art
methods, the comprehensive best performance demonstrates the effectiveness of
the methods proposed in this paper on several simulated and real data.

TL;DR: MixGRPO提出了一种结合SDE和ODE的混合采样策略，通过滑动窗口机制优化MDP中的流程匹配模型，显著提升了效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如FlowGRPO在图像生成的人偏好对齐中效率低下，因为需要对MDP中的所有去噪步骤进行采样和优化。

Method: MixGRPO通过滑动窗口机制，在窗口内使用SDE采样和GRPO优化，窗口外使用ODE采样，减少优化开销并加速收敛。

Result: MixGRPO在效率和性能上显著优于DanceGRPO，训练时间减少近50%，其变体MixGRPO-Flash进一步减少71%训练时间。

Conclusion: MixGRPO通过混合采样策略和滑动窗口设计，有效提升了人偏好对齐的效率与性能。

Abstract: Although GRPO substantially enhances flow matching models in human preference
alignment of image generation, methods such as FlowGRPO still exhibit
inefficiency due to the necessity of sampling and optimizing over all denoising
steps specified by the Markov Decision Process (MDP). In this paper, we propose
$\textbf{MixGRPO}$, a novel framework that leverages the flexibility of mixed
sampling strategies through the integration of stochastic differential
equations (SDE) and ordinary differential equations (ODE). This streamlines the
optimization process within the MDP to improve efficiency and boost
performance. Specifically, MixGRPO introduces a sliding window mechanism, using
SDE sampling and GRPO-guided optimization only within the window, while
applying ODE sampling outside. This design confines sampling randomness to the
time-steps within the window, thereby reducing the optimization overhead, and
allowing for more focused gradient updates to accelerate convergence.
Additionally, as time-steps beyond the sliding window are not involved in
optimization, higher-order solvers are supported for sampling. So we present a
faster variant, termed $\textbf{MixGRPO-Flash}$, which further improves
training efficiency while achieving comparable performance. MixGRPO exhibits
substantial gains across multiple dimensions of human preference alignment,
outperforming DanceGRPO in both effectiveness and efficiency, with nearly 50%
lower training time. Notably, MixGRPO-Flash further reduces training time by
71%. Codes and models are available at

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence agents represent the next major revolution in the
continuous technological evolution of industrial automation. In this paper, we
introduce a new approach for business process design and development that
leverages the capabilities of Agentic AI. Departing from the traditional
task-based approach to business process design, we propose an agent-based
method, where agents contribute to the achievement of business goals,
identified by a set of business objects. When a single agent cannot fulfill a
goal, we have a merge goal that can be achieved through the collaboration of
multiple agents. The proposed model leads to a more modular and intelligent
business process development by organizing it around goals, objects, and
agents. As a result, this approach enables flexible and context-aware
automation in dynamic industrial environments.

TL;DR: 提出DualSG框架，利用LLM作为语义指导模块而非独立预测器，结合时间序列字幕显式引导，提升多变量时间序列预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将LLM作为端到端预测器导致数值精度损失，或隐式对齐文本与时间序列模态时遇到困难，需改进。

Method: 提出DualSG双流框架，引入时间序列字幕显式总结趋势模式，设计字幕引导融合模块显式建模变量关系。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上，DualSG优于15种先进基线方法。

Conclusion: 显式结合数值预测与语义指导具有显著价值。

Abstract: Multivariate Time Series Forecasting plays a key role in many applications.
Recent works have explored using Large Language Models for MTSF to take
advantage of their reasoning abilities. However, many methods treat LLMs as
end-to-end forecasters, which often leads to a loss of numerical precision and
forces LLMs to handle patterns beyond their intended design. Alternatively,
methods that attempt to align textual and time series modalities within latent
space frequently encounter alignment difficulty. In this paper, we propose to
treat LLMs not as standalone forecasters, but as semantic guidance modules
within a dual-stream framework. We propose DualSG, a dual-stream framework that
provides explicit semantic guidance, where LLMs act as Semantic Guides to
refine rather than replace traditional predictions. As part of DualSG, we
introduce Time Series Caption, an explicit prompt format that summarizes trend
patterns in natural language and provides interpretable context for LLMs,
rather than relying on implicit alignment between text and time series in the
latent space. We also design a caption-guided fusion module that explicitly
models inter-variable relationships while reducing noise and computation.
Experiments on real-world datasets from diverse domains show that DualSG
consistently outperforms 15 state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating the value
of explicitly combining numerical forecasting with semantic guidance.

<details>

Motivation: 在多智能体环境中，理解其他智能体的信念和意图对有效交互至关重要。现有目标识别研究多将观察者视为被动推理者，AGR则强调主动获取信息以减少不确定性。

Method: 采用概率框架，结合联合信念更新机制和MCTS算法，无需领域特定知识即可高效推断目标。

Result: 在网格域中的实验表明，联合信念更新显著优于被动目标识别，且领域无关的MCTS与领域特定的贪婪基线表现相当。

Conclusion: 该方案为多智能体系统提供了实用且鲁棒的目标推断框架，推动了交互性和适应性的发展。

Abstract: In multi-agent environments, effective interaction hinges on understanding
the beliefs and intentions of other agents. While prior work on goal
recognition has largely treated the observer as a passive reasoner, Active Goal
Recognition (AGR) focuses on strategically gathering information to reduce
uncertainty. We adopt a probabilistic framework for Active Goal Recognition and
propose an integrated solution that combines a joint belief update mechanism
with a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm, allowing the observer to plan
efficiently and infer the actor's hidden goal without requiring domain-specific
knowledge. Through comprehensive empirical evaluation in a grid-based domain,
we show that our joint belief update significantly outperforms passive goal
recognition, and that our domain-independent MCTS performs comparably to our
strong domain-specific greedy baseline. These results establish our solution as
a practical and robust framework for goal inference, advancing the field toward
more interactive and adaptive multi-agent systems.

Conclusion: EDGE-GRPO能有效缓解优势崩溃问题，提升推理性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made remarkable progress in enhancing
step-by-step reasoning through reinforcement learning. However, the Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm, which relies on sparse reward
rules, often encounters the issue of identical rewards within groups, leading
to the advantage collapse problem. Existing works typically address this
challenge from two perspectives: enforcing model reflection to enhance response
diversity, and introducing internal feedback to augment the training signal
(advantage). In this work, we begin by analyzing the limitations of model
reflection and investigating the policy entropy of responses at the
fine-grained sample level. Based on our experimental findings, we propose the
EDGE-GRPO algorithm, which adopts \textbf{E}ntropy-\textbf{D}riven Advantage
and \textbf{G}uided \textbf{E}rror Correction to effectively mitigate the
problem of advantage collapse. Extensive experiments on several main reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our approach. It is

Conclusion: MultiEditor通过联合编辑多模态数据，有效提升自动驾驶感知模型对罕见类别的识别能力。

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems rely heavily on multimodal perception data to
understand complex environments. However, the long-tailed distribution of
real-world data hinders generalization, especially for rare but safety-critical
vehicle categories. To address this challenge, we propose MultiEditor, a
dual-branch latent diffusion framework designed to edit images and LiDAR point
clouds in driving scenarios jointly. At the core of our approach is introducing
3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) as a structural and appearance prior for target
objects. Leveraging this prior, we design a multi-level appearance control
mechanism--comprising pixel-level pasting, semantic-level guidance, and
multi-branch refinement--to achieve high-fidelity reconstruction across
modalities. We further propose a depth-guided deformable cross-modality
condition module that adaptively enables mutual guidance between modalities
using 3DGS-rendered depth, significantly enhancing cross-modality consistency.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MultiEditor achieves superior
performance in visual and geometric fidelity, editing controllability, and
cross-modality consistency. Furthermore, generating rare-category vehicle data
with MultiEditor substantially enhances the detection accuracy of perception
models on underrepresented classes.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) excel at predictive tasks on graph-structured
data but often lack the ability to incorporate symbolic domain knowledge and
perform general reasoning. Relational Bayesian Networks (RBNs), in contrast,
enable fully generative probabilistic modeling over graph-like structures and
support rich symbolic knowledge and probabilistic inference. This paper
presents a neuro-symbolic framework that seamlessly integrates GNNs into RBNs,
combining the learning strength of GNNs with the flexible reasoning
capabilities of RBNs.
  We develop two implementations of this integration: one compiles GNNs
directly into the native RBN language, while the other maintains the GNN as an
external component. Both approaches preserve the semantics and computational
properties of GNNs while fully aligning with the RBN modeling paradigm. We also
propose a maximum a-posteriori (MAP) inference method for these neuro-symbolic
models.
  To demonstrate the framework's versatility, we apply it to two distinct
problems. First, we transform a GNN for node classification into a collective
classification model that explicitly models homo- and heterophilic label
patterns, substantially improving accuracy. Second, we introduce a
multi-objective network optimization problem in environmental planning, where
MAP inference supports complex decision-making. Both applications include new
publicly available benchmark datasets.
  This work introduces a powerful and coherent neuro-symbolic approach to graph
data, bridging learning and reasoning in ways that enable novel applications
and improved performance across diverse tasks.

Accurate and consistent evaluation is essential for individuals experiencing
pain, and it supports the development of effective and advanced management
strategies. Automatic pain assessment systems provide continuous monitoring and
support clinical decision-making, aiming to reduce distress and prevent
functional decline. This study has been submitted to the \textit{Second
Multimodal Sensing Grand Challenge for Next-Gen Pain Assessment (AI4PAIN)}. The
proposed method introduces a pipeline that leverages respiration as the input
signal and incorporates a highly efficient cross-attention transformer
alongside a multi-windowing strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
respiration is a valuable physiological modality for pain assessment. Moreover,
experiments revealed that compact and efficient models, when properly
optimized, can achieve strong performance, often surpassing larger
counterparts. The proposed multi-window approach effectively captures both
short-term and long-term features, as well as global characteristics, thereby
enhancing the model's representational capacity.

*Malik Uzair Mehmood,Shahid Hussain,Wen Li Wang,Muhammad Usama Malik*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种基于LLMs的自动分类方法，用于GitHub README文件的内容分类，性能优于现有方法，F1分数达0.98。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GitHub README文件的完整性影响仓库的采用和利用，但现有文件常缺乏细节。LLMs在文本任务中表现优异，可用于自动分类。

Method: 利用BERT、DistilBERT和RoBERTa三种LLMs，基于4226个README文件片段的数据集进行微调，并探索了PEFT技术。

Result: 方法F1分数达0.98，优于现有技术，且PEFT技术提供了经济高效的替代方案。

Conclusion: LLMs可用于自动分类GitHub README文件，为仓库管理提供自动化工具，提升其识别和使用潜力。

Abstract: GitHub is the world's most popular platform for storing, sharing, and
managing code. Every GitHub repository has a README file associated with it.
The README files should contain project-related information as per the
recommendations of GitHub to support the usage and improvement of repositories.
However, GitHub repository owners sometimes neglected these recommendations.
This prevents a GitHub repository from reaching its full potential. This
research posits that the comprehensiveness of a GitHub repository's README file
significantly influences its adoption and utilization, with a lack of detail
potentially hindering its full potential for widespread engagement and impact
within the research community. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great
performance in many text-based tasks including text classification, text
generation, text summarization and text translation. In this study, an approach
is developed to fine-tune LLMs for automatically classifying different sections
of GitHub README files. Three encoder-only LLMs are utilized, including BERT,
DistilBERT and RoBERTa. These pre-trained models are then fine-tuned based on a
gold-standard dataset consisting of 4226 README file sections. This approach
outperforms current state-of-the-art methods and has achieved an overall F1
score of 0.98. Moreover, we have also investigated the use of
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques like Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA) and shown an economical alternative to full fine-tuning without
compromising much performance. The results demonstrate the potential of using
LLMs in designing an automatic classifier for categorizing the content of
GitHub README files. Consequently, this study contributes to the development of
automated tools for GitHub repositories to improve their identifications and
potential usages.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in text understanding and generation but
raise significant safety and ethical concerns in high-stakes applications. To
mitigate these risks, we present Libra-Guard, a cutting-edge safeguard system
designed to enhance the safety of Chinese-based LLMs. Leveraging a two-stage
curriculum training pipeline, Libra-Guard enhances data efficiency by employing
guard pretraining on synthetic samples, followed by fine-tuning on
high-quality, real-world data, thereby significantly reducing reliance on
manual annotations. To enable rigorous safety evaluations, we also introduce

effectiveness of safeguard systems for Chinese content. It covers seven
critical harm scenarios and includes over 5,700 samples annotated by domain
experts. Experiments show that Libra-Guard achieves 86.79% accuracy,
outperforming Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct (74.33%) and ShieldLM-Qwen-14B-Chat
(65.69%), and nearing closed-source models like Claude-3.5-Sonnet and GPT-4o.
These contributions establish a robust framework for advancing the safety
governance of Chinese LLMs and represent a tentative step toward developing
safer, more reliable Chinese AI systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种不依赖LLM的零样本人类活动识别方法，通过自然语言建模传感器数据和活动，利用其嵌入进行分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的方法存在隐私、依赖外部服务和预测不一致等问题，需要替代方案。

Method: 利用自然语言建模传感器数据和活动，通过其嵌入进行零样本分类。

Result: 在六个数据集上的详细案例研究表明，该方法能有效提升零样本识别性能。

Conclusion: 语言建模可增强零样本HAR系统，避免LLM带来的风险。

Abstract: Developing zero-shot human activity recognition (HAR) methods is a critical
direction in smart home research -- considering its impact on making HAR
systems work across smart homes having diverse sensing modalities, layouts, and
activities of interest. The state-of-the-art solutions along this direction are
based on generating natural language descriptions of the sensor data and
feeding it via a carefully crafted prompt to the LLM to perform classification.
Despite their performance guarantees, such ``prompt-the-LLM'' approaches carry
several risks, including privacy invasion, reliance on an external service, and
inconsistent predictions due to version changes, making a case for alternative
zero-shot HAR methods that do not require prompting the LLMs. In this paper, we
propose one such solution that models sensor data and activities using natural
language, leveraging its embeddings to perform zero-shot classification and
thereby bypassing the need to prompt the LLMs for activity predictions. The
impact of our work lies in presenting a detailed case study on six datasets,
highlighting how language modeling can bolster HAR systems in zero-shot
recognition.

Motivation: 移动网络中的RCA需要可解释性、领域专业知识和因果推理，现有开源推理LLMs在此任务上表现不佳。

Method: 提出两阶段训练方法，结合监督微调和强化学习，并引入TeleLogs数据集进行基准测试。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在性能和推理质量上显著优于现有模型，并能泛化到随机测试变体。

Conclusion: 领域适应和推理增强的LLMs在RCA任务中具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Root Cause Analysis (RCA) in mobile networks remains a challenging task due
to the need for interpretability, domain expertise, and causal reasoning. In
this work, we propose a lightweight framework that leverages Large Language
Models (LLMs) for RCA. To do so, we introduce TeleLogs, a curated dataset of
annotated troubleshooting problems designed to benchmark RCA capabilities. Our
evaluation reveals that existing open-source reasoning LLMs struggle with these
problems, underscoring the need for domain-specific adaptation. To address this
issue, we propose a two-stage training methodology that combines supervised
fine-tuning with reinforcement learning to improve the accuracy and reasoning
quality of LLMs. The proposed approach fine-tunes a series of RCA models to
integrate domain knowledge and generate structured, multi-step diagnostic
explanations, improving both interpretability and effectiveness. Extensive
experiments across multiple LLM sizes show significant performance gains over
state-of-the-art reasoning and non-reasoning models, including strong
generalization to randomized test variants. These results demonstrate the
promise of domain-adapted, reasoning-enhanced LLMs for practical and
explainable RCA in network operation and management.

techniques. This paper evaluates the impact of structural pruning and
activation-aware quantization on a fine-tuned LLAVA model for medical
applications. We propose a novel layer selection method for pruning, analyze
different quantization techniques, and assess the performance trade-offs in a
prune-SFT-quantize pipeline. Our proposed method enables MLLMs with 7B

TL;DR: PHAX框架通过结构化论证和用户建模，为AI驱动的公共卫生决策提供透明、个性化的解释，增强信任和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可解释AI方法在公共卫生领域缺乏对不同利益相关者的适应性和结构化解释能力，PHAX旨在填补这一空白。

Method: PHAX结合可废止推理、自适应自然语言技术和用户建模，生成上下文感知的、针对特定受众的解释。

Result: PHAX在医疗术语简化、医患沟通和政策解释等用例中展示了其适用性，提升了可解释性和信任度。

Conclusion: PHAX通过将形式化推理与沟通需求结合，推动了透明、以人为本的AI在公共卫生中的应用。

Abstract: Ensuring transparency and trust in AI-driven public health and biomedical
sciences systems requires more than accurate predictions-it demands
explanations that are clear, contextual, and socially accountable. While
explainable AI (XAI) has advanced in areas like feature attribution and model
interpretability, most methods still lack the structure and adaptability needed
for diverse health stakeholders, including clinicians, policymakers, and the
general public. We introduce PHAX-a Public Health Argumentation and
eXplainability framework-that leverages structured argumentation to generate
human-centered explanations for AI outputs. PHAX is a multi-layer architecture
combining defeasible reasoning, adaptive natural language techniques, and user
modeling to produce context-aware, audience-specific justifications. More
specifically, we show how argumentation enhances explainability by supporting
AI-driven decision-making, justifying recommendations, and enabling interactive
dialogues across user types. We demonstrate the applicability of PHAX through
use cases such as medical term simplification, patient-clinician communication,
and policy justification. In particular, we show how simplification decisions
can be modeled as argument chains and personalized based on user
expertise-enhancing both interpretability and trust. By aligning formal
reasoning methods with communicative demands, PHAX contributes to a broader
vision of transparent, human-centered AI in public health.

Motivation: 现有GUI代理在训练和推理中存在推理设计困境、奖励无效和视觉噪声问题，亟需改进。

Method: 提出UI-AGILE框架，包括训练阶段的连续奖励函数、"简单思考"奖励和裁剪重采样策略，以及推理阶段的分解定位选择方法。

Result: 在ScreenSpot-Pro和ScreenSpot-v2基准测试中达到最优性能，ScreenSpot-Pro上比最佳基线提升23%的定位准确率。

Conclusion: UI-AGILE通过综合优化训练和推理方法，显著提升了GUI代理的性能，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has driven
significant advances in Graphical User Interface (GUI) agent capabilities.
Nevertheless, existing GUI agent training and inference techniques still suffer
from a dilemma for reasoning designs, ineffective reward, and visual noise. To
address these issues, we introduce UI-AGILE, a comprehensive framework
enhancing GUI agents at both the training and inference stages. For training,
we propose a suite of improvements to the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) process:
1) a Continuous Reward function to incentivize high-precision grounding; 2) a
"Simple Thinking" reward to balance planning with speed and grounding accuracy;
and 3) a Cropping-based Resampling strategy to mitigate the sparse reward
problem and improve learning on complex tasks. For inference, we present
Decomposed Grounding with Selection, a novel method that dramatically improves
grounding accuracy on high-resolution displays by breaking the image into
smaller, manageable parts. Experiments show that UI-AGILE achieves the
state-of-the-art performance on two benchmarks ScreenSpot-Pro and
ScreenSpot-v2. For instance, using both our proposed training and inference
enhancement methods brings 23% grounding accuracy improvement over the best
baseline on ScreenSpot-Pro.

TL;DR: UserBench是一个用户为中心的基准测试，用于评估LLM代理在多轮、偏好驱动的交互中的表现，发现现有模型在用户意图对齐和偏好挖掘方面存在显著不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM代理在模糊、动态或间接表达的目标下与用户主动协作的能力尚未充分探索，需要新的评估方法。

Method: 引入UserBench基准，模拟用户从模糊目标出发逐步揭示偏好，要求代理主动澄清意图并利用工具决策。

Result: 评估显示，模型仅20%的时间完全符合用户意图，最先进模型通过交互挖掘不到30%的用户偏好。

Conclusion: UserBench为提升LLM代理的协作能力提供了关键工具，凸显了任务执行与用户对齐之间的差距。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs)-based agents have made impressive progress in
reasoning and tool use, enabling them to solve complex tasks. However, their
ability to proactively collaborate with users, especially when goals are vague,
evolving, or indirectly expressed, remains underexplored. To address this gap,
we introduce UserBench, a user-centric benchmark designed to evaluate agents in
multi-turn, preference-driven interactions. UserBench features simulated users
who start with underspecified goals and reveal preferences incrementally,
requiring agents to proactively clarify intent and make grounded decisions with
tools. Our evaluation of leading open- and closed-source LLMs reveals a
significant disconnect between task completion and user alignment. For
instance, models provide answers that fully align with all user intents only
20% of the time on average, and even the most advanced models uncover fewer
than 30% of all user preferences through active interaction. These results
highlight the challenges of building agents that are not just capable task
executors, but true collaborative partners. UserBench offers an interactive
environment to measure and advance this critical capability.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
processing extensive offline datasets. However, they often face challenges in
acquiring and integrating complex, knowledge online. Traditional AI training
paradigms, predominantly based on supervised learning or reinforcement
learning, mirror a 'Piagetian' model of independent exploration. These
approaches typically rely on large datasets and sparse feedback signals,
limiting the models' ability to learn efficiently from interactions. Drawing
inspiration from Vygotsky's sociocultural theory, this study explores the
potential of socially mediated learning paradigms to address these limitations.
  We introduce a dynamic environment, termed the 'AI Social Gym', where an AI
learner agent engages in dyadic pedagogical dialogues with knowledgeable AI
teacher agents. These interactions emphasize external, structured dialogue as a
core mechanism for knowledge acquisition, contrasting with methods that depend
solely on internal inference or pattern recognition.
  Our investigation focuses on how different pedagogical strategies impact the
AI learning process in the context of ontology acquisition. Empirical results
indicate that such dialogic approaches-particularly those involving
mixed-direction interactions combining top-down explanations with
learner-initiated questioning-significantly enhance the LLM's ability to
acquire and apply new knowledge, outperforming both unidirectional
instructional methods and direct access to structured knowledge, formats
typically present in training datasets.
  These findings suggest that integrating pedagogical and psychological
insights into AI and robot training can substantially improve post-training
knowledge acquisition and response quality. This approach offers a
complementary pathway to existing strategies like prompt engineering

Abstract: This study presented the development of a deep learning-based Automatic
Speech Recognition system for Shona, a low-resource language characterized by
unique tonal and grammatical complexities. The research aimed to address the
challenges posed by limited training data, lack of labelled data, and the
intricate tonal nuances present in Shona speech, with the objective of
achieving significant improvements in recognition accuracy compared to
traditional statistical models. The research first explored the feasibility of
using deep learning to develop an accurate ASR system for Shona. Second, it
investigated the specific challenges involved in designing and implementing
deep learning architectures for Shona speech recognition and proposed
strategies to mitigate these challenges. Lastly, it compared the performance of
the deep learning-based model with existing statistical models in terms of
accuracy. The developed ASR system utilized a hybrid architecture consisting of
a Convolutional Neural Network for acoustic modelling and a Long Short-Term
Memory network for language modelling. To overcome the scarcity of data, data
augmentation techniques and transfer learning were employed. Attention
mechanisms were also incorporated to accommodate the tonal nature of Shona
speech. The resulting ASR system achieved impressive results, with a Word Error
Rate of 29%, Phoneme Error Rate of 12%, and an overall accuracy of 74%. These
metrics indicated the potential of deep learning to enhance ASR accuracy for
under-resourced languages like Shona. This study contributed to the advancement
of ASR technology for under-resourced languages like Shona, ultimately
fostering improved accessibility and communication for Shona speakers
worldwide.

Abstract: Text generated by artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots is increasingly used
in English as a foreign language (EFL) writing contexts, yet its impact on
students' expository writing process and compositions remains understudied.
This research examines how EFL secondary students edit AI-generated text.
Exploring editing behaviors in their expository writing process and in
expository compositions, and their effect on human-rated scores for content,
organization, language, and overall quality. Participants were 39 Hong Kong
secondary students who wrote an expository composition with AI chatbots in a
workshop. A convergent design was employed to analyze their screen recordings
and compositions to examine students' editing behaviors and writing qualities.
Analytical methods included qualitative coding, descriptive statistics,
temporal sequence analysis, human-rated scoring, and multiple linear regression
analysis. We analyzed over 260 edits per dataset, and identified two editing
patterns: one where students refined introductory units repeatedly before
progressing, and another where they quickly shifted to extensive edits in body
units (e.g., topic and supporting sentences). MLR analyses revealed that the
number of AI-generated words positively predicted all score dimensions, while
most editing variables showed minimal impact. These results suggest a
disconnect between students' significant editing effort and improved
composition quality, indicating AI supports but does not replace writing
skills. The findings highlight the importance of genre-specific instruction and
process-focused writing before AI integration. Educators should also develop
assessments valuing both process and product to encourage critical engagement
with AI text.

Motivation: 探讨Floridi和Taddeo提出的"零语义承诺"条件及其解决方案的可行性，并重新定义基础问题的核心。

Method: 分析Floridi和Taddeo的方案，对比Luc Steels的建议，结合对计算的理解重新思考问题。

Result: Floridi和Taddeo的条件无法实现，基础问题应聚焦于解释和重现人工计算代理中意义的行为能力和功能。

Conclusion: 唯一有意义的基础问题是如何解释和重现人工计算代理中意义的行为能力和功能。

Abstract: Floridi and Taddeo propose a condition of "zero semantic commitment" for
solutions to the grounding problem, and a solution to it. I argue briefly that
their condition cannot be fulfilled, not even by their own solution. After a
look at Luc Steels' very different competing suggestion, I suggest that we need
to re-think what the problem is and what role the 'goals' in a system play in
formulating the problem. On the basis of a proper understanding of computing, I
come to the conclusion that the only sensible grounding problem is how we can
explain and re-produce the behavioral ability and function of meaning in
artificial computational agents

### [77] [Model-free Speculative Decoding for Transformer-based ASR with Token Map Drafting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21522)
*Tuan Vu Ho,Hiroaki Kokubo,Masaaki Yamamoto,Yohei Kawaguchi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Token Map Drafting的无模型推测解码技术，用于加速基于Transformer的端到端自动语音识别（ASR）系统在CPU设备上的推理速度，同时保持转录准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推测解码方法需要额外的草稿模型，这在缺乏硬件加速器的设备上不实用。因此，作者提出了一种无需草稿模型的方法，以解决资源受限设备的部署问题。

Method: 利用预计算的n-gram token map（基于领域特定训练数据）进行推测解码，避免了草稿模型的使用，从而减少计算开销。

Result: 在CI-AVSR数据集和内部数据集上分别实现了1.27倍和1.37倍的解码加速，且未降低识别准确率。在CPU上比Distill-spec基线速度快10%。

Conclusion: Token Map Drafting是一种高效且实用的方法，特别适用于结构化、低困惑度领域的ASR应用，能够在资源受限设备上显著提升推理速度。

Abstract: End-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems based on transformer
architectures, such as Whisper, offer high transcription accuracy and
robustness. However, their autoregressive decoding is computationally
expensive, hence limiting deployment on CPU-based and resource-constrained
devices. Speculative decoding (SD) mitigates this issue by using a smaller
draft model to propose candidate tokens, which are then verified by the main
model. However, this approach is impractical for devices lacking hardware
accelerators like GPUs. To address this, we propose \emph{Token Map Drafting},
a model-free SD technique that eliminates the need for a separate draft model.
Instead, we leverage a precomputed n-gram token map derived from
domain-specific training data, enabling efficient speculative decoding with
minimal overhead. Our method significantly accelerates ASR inference in
structured, low-perplexity domains without sacrificing transcription accuracy.
Experimental results demonstrate decoding speed-ups of $1.27\times$ on the
CI-AVSR dataset and $1.37\times$ on our internal dataset without degrading
recognition accuracy. Additionally, our approach achieves a $10\%$ absolute
improvement in decoding speed over the Distill-spec baseline running on CPU,
highlighting its effectiveness for on-device ASR applications.

TL;DR: GPT-4的回应受提问情感语气影响，负面问题引发更少负面回应，存在“反弹”偏差，敏感话题中更明显。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究情感语气如何影响GPT-4的回应，揭示潜在的偏差及其对AI对齐和信任的影响。

Method: 通过156个情感语气不同的提示（涵盖争议和日常话题）分析GPT-4的回应，使用1536维嵌入可视化语义漂移。

Result: GPT-4对负面问题的负面回应概率是中性问题的三分之一，敏感话题中语气影响被抑制。

Conclusion: 情感语气驱动的偏差是未充分研究的领域，对AI对齐和信任有重要启示。

Abstract: Large Language Models like GPT-4 adjust their responses not only based on the
question asked, but also on how it is emotionally phrased. We systematically
vary the emotional tone of 156 prompts - spanning controversial and everyday
topics - and analyze how it affects model responses. Our findings show that
GPT-4 is three times less likely to respond negatively to a negatively framed
question than to a neutral one. This suggests a "rebound" bias where the model
overcorrects, often shifting toward neutrality or positivity. On sensitive
topics (e.g., justice or politics), this effect is even more pronounced:
tone-based variation is suppressed, suggesting an alignment override. We
introduce concepts like the "tone floor" - a lower bound in response negativity
- and use tone-valence transition matrices to quantify behavior. Visualizations
based on 1536-dimensional embeddings confirm semantic drift based on tone. Our
work highlights an underexplored class of biases driven by emotional framing in
prompts, with implications for AI alignment and trust. Code and data are

TL;DR: MNEME框架通过稀疏模型差异检测，评估LLM微调或遗忘后的副作用，无需微调数据即可预测行为变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法无法检测微调或遗忘后的意外副作用，如任务间性能退化。

Method: MNEME通过比较基础模型和微调模型在任务无关数据上的行为差异，识别副作用。

Result: 在三种场景下，MNEME预测副作用的准确率达95%，且可通过高激活样本部分逆转效果。

Conclusion: 稀疏探测和差异分析为理解和管理LLM行为提供了可扩展的自动化工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are frequently fine-tuned or unlearned to adapt
to new tasks or eliminate undesirable behaviors. While existing evaluation
methods assess performance after such interventions, there remains no general
approach for detecting unintended side effects, such as unlearning biology
content degrading performance on chemistry tasks, particularly when these
effects are unpredictable or emergent. To address this issue, we introduce
MNEME, Model diffiNg for Evaluating Mechanistic Effects, a lightweight
framework for identifying these side effects using sparse model diffing. MNEME
compares base and fine-tuned models on task-agnostic data (for example, The
Pile, LMSYS-Chat-1M) without access to fine-tuning data to isolate behavioral
shifts. Applied to five LLMs across three scenarios: WMDP knowledge unlearning,
emergent misalignment, and benign fine-tuning, MNEME achieves up to 95 percent
accuracy in predicting side effects, aligning with known benchmarks and
requiring no custom heuristics. Furthermore, we show that retraining on
high-activation samples can partially reverse these effects. Our results
demonstrate that sparse probing and diffing offer a scalable and automated lens
into fine-tuning-induced model changes, providing practical tools for
understanding and managing LLM behavior.

*Jaydip Sen,Subhasis Dasgupta,Hetvi Waghela*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多业余模型对比解码（MACD）方法，通过集成多个业余模型来更全面地捕捉语言生成中的失败模式，提升了生成文本的流畅性、连贯性和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的对比解码（CD）方法仅依赖单一业余模型，无法全面捕捉语言生成中的多样化失败模式（如重复、幻觉和风格漂移）。

Method: MACD通过集成多个业余模型，结合平均和共识惩罚机制整合对比信号，并扩展了多业余设置下的合理性约束。

Result: 实验表明，MACD在新闻、百科和叙事等多个领域均优于传统解码方法和原始CD方法，提升了生成质量。

Conclusion: MACD无需额外训练或微调，即可显著提升文本生成的流畅性、连贯性、多样性和可控性。

Abstract: Contrastive Decoding (CD) has emerged as an effective inference-time strategy
for enhancing open-ended text generation by exploiting the divergence in output
probabilities between a large expert language model and a smaller amateur
model. Although CD improves coherence and fluency, its dependence on a single
amateur restricts its capacity to capture the diverse and multifaceted failure
modes of language generation, such as repetition, hallucination, and stylistic
drift. This paper proposes Multi-Amateur Contrastive Decoding (MACD), a
generalization of the CD framework that employs an ensemble of amateur models
to more comprehensively characterize undesirable generation patterns. MACD
integrates contrastive signals through both averaging and consensus
penalization mechanisms and extends the plausibility constraint to operate
effectively in the multi-amateur setting. Furthermore, the framework enables
controllable generation by incorporating amateurs with targeted stylistic or
content biases. Experimental results across multiple domains, such as news,
encyclopedic, and narrative, demonstrate that MACD consistently surpasses
conventional decoding methods and the original CD approach in terms of fluency,
coherence, diversity, and adaptability, all without requiring additional
training or fine-tuning.

*Mohammad AL-Smadi*

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合预训练语言模型与统计和语言特征的方法，用于检测新闻句子中的主观性，并在多语言和零样本设置中取得了竞争性表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决新闻文章中句子主观性检测的挑战，区分作者主观观点与客观描述。

Method: 采用特征增强的Transformer架构，结合预训练模型的上下文嵌入与统计和语言特征（如POS标签和TF-IDF），并设计了门控机制。

Result: 在英语、阿拉伯语、德语、意大利语等多种语言中表现优异，尤其在零样本设置中取得领先排名。

Conclusion: 结合TF-IDF特征与门控机制及跨语言迁移对主观性检测至关重要，模型对跨语言微调顺序和语言接近性敏感。

Abstract: This paper presents our approach to the CheckThat! 2025 Task 1 on
subjectivity detection, where systems are challenged to distinguish whether a
sentence from a news article expresses the subjective view of the author or
presents an objective view on the covered topic. We propose a feature-augmented
transformer architecture that combines contextual embeddings from pre-trained
language models with statistical and linguistic features. Our system leveraged
pre-trained transformers with additional lexical features: for Arabic we used
AraELECTRA augmented with part-of-speech (POS) tags and TF-IDF features, while
for the other languages we fine-tuned a cross-lingual DeBERTa~V3 model combined
with TF-IDF features through a gating mechanism. We evaluated our system in
monolingual, multilingual, and zero-shot settings across multiple languages
including English, Arabic, German, Italian, and several unseen languages. The
results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving competitive
performance across different languages with notable success in the monolingual
setting for English (rank 1st with macro-F1=0.8052), German (rank 3rd with
macro-F1=0.8013), Arabic (rank 4th with macro-F1=0.5771), and Romanian (rank
1st with macro-F1=0.8126) in the zero-shot setting. We also conducted an
ablation analysis that demonstrated the importance of combining TF-IDF features
with the gating mechanism and the cross-lingual transfer for subjectivity
detection. Furthermore, our analysis reveals the model's sensitivity to both
the order of cross-lingual fine-tuning and the linguistic proximity of the
training languages.

Motivation: 探索广告内容措辞对广告可见性的影响，优化广告在检索系统和LLM生成响应中的表现。

Method: 引入监督微调框架，结合自定义损失函数平衡语义相关性和内容保真度，使用DeltaMRR@K和DeltaDIR@K评估效果。

Result: 实验表明，PPO训练模型在大多数情况下优于提示工程和监督微调，最高提升2.79 DeltaDIR@5和0.0073 DeltaMRR@5。

Conclusion: 广告措辞、提示格式和强化学习在LLM集成检索系统中对广告重写的效果至关重要。

Abstract: Search algorithms and user query relevance have given LLMs the ability to
return relevant information, but the effect of content phrasing on ad
visibility remains underexplored. We investigate how LLM-based rewriting of
advertisements can improve their ranking in retrieval systems and inclusion in
generated LLM responses, without modifying the retrieval model itself. We
introduce a supervised fine-tuning framework with a custom loss balancing
semantic relevance and content fidelity. To evaluate effectiveness, we propose
two metrics: DeltaMRR@K (ranking improvement) and DeltaDIR@K (inclusion
frequency improvement). Our approach presents a scalable method to optimize ad
phrasing, enhancing visibility in retrieval-based LLM workflows. Experiments
across both instruction-based and few-shot prompting demonstrate that PPO
trained models outperform both prompt engineering and supervised fine-tuning in
most cases, achieving up to a 2.79 DeltaDIR@5 and 0.0073 DeltaMRR@5 in
instruction-based prompting. These results highlight the importance of how the
ad is written before retrieval and prompt format and reinforcement learning in
effective ad rewriting for LLM integrated retrieval systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿拉伯语修辞虽历史悠久且备受推崇，但缺乏客观方法评估其使用程度、比较不同文本或作者的修辞水平。

Method: 研究编制了84种常见修辞手法的清单，开发了识别和计算修辞密度的系统，并创建了电子和模拟工具支持计算。

Result: 成功开发了一套工具，能够准确报告任何阿拉伯语文本或演讲中的修辞密度及其分布。

Conclusion: 该工具为阿拉伯语修辞的量化分析提供了可行方法，有助于跨文本、作者和时代的修辞比较。

Abstract: Arabic Rhetoric is the field of Arabic linguistics which governs the art and
science of conveying a message with greater beauty, impact and persuasiveness.
The field is as ancient as the Arabic language itself and is found extensively
in classical and contemporary Arabic poetry, free verse and prose. In practical
terms, it is the intelligent use of word order, figurative speech and
linguistic embellishments to enhance message delivery. Despite the volumes that
have been written about it and the high status accorded to it, there is no way
to objectively know whether a speaker or writer has used Arabic rhetoric in a
given text, to what extent, and why. There is no objective way to compare the
use of Arabic rhetoric across genres, authors or epochs. It is impossible to
know which of pre-Islamic poetry, Andalucian Arabic poetry, or modern literary
genres are richer in Arabic rhetoric. The aim of the current study was to
devise a way to measure the density of the literary devices which constitute
Arabic rhetoric in a given text, as a proxy marker for Arabic rhetoric itself.
A comprehensive list of 84 of the commonest literary devices and their
definitions was compiled. A system of identifying literary devices in texts was
constructed. A method of calculating the density of literary devices based on
the morpheme count of the text was utilised. Four electronic tools and an
analogue tool were created to support the calculation of an Arabic text's
rhetorical literary device density, including a website and online calculator.
Additionally, a technique of reporting the distribution of literary devices
used across the three sub-domains of Arabic rhetoric was created. The output of
this project is a working tool which can accurately report the density of
Arabic rhetoric in any Arabic text or speech.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型在语义关注变化下的内部激活轨迹，以揭示其语义抽象和对齐的动态机制。

Method: 使用20组匹配提示，涵盖多个语义领域，分析Gemma3-1b和LLaMA3.2-3b模型的激活轨迹，计算曲率和显著性指标。

Result: LLaMA模型在语义关注强度增加时表现出显著的曲率和显著性变化，而Gemma的响应较弱。

Conclusion: Curved Inference框架揭示了模型语义导航的动态机制，为诊断模型对齐和抽象提供了新方法。

Abstract: We propose Curved Inference - a geometric Interpretability framework that
tracks how the residual stream trajectory of a large language model bends in
response to shifts in semantic concern. Across 20 matched prompts spanning
emotional, moral, perspective, logical, identity, environmental, and nonsense
domains, we analyse Gemma3-1b and LLaMA3.2-3b using five native-space metrics,
with a primary focus on curvature (\k{appa}_i) and salience (S(t)). These
metrics are computed under a pullback semantic metric derived from the
unembedding matrix, ensuring that all measurements reflect token-aligned
geometry rather than raw coordinate structure. We find that concern-shifted
prompts reliably alter internal activation trajectories in both models - with
LLaMA exhibiting consistent, statistically significant scaling in both
curvature and salience as concern intensity increases. Gemma also responds to
concern but shows weaker differentiation between moderate and strong variants.
Our results support a two-layer view of LLM geometry - a latent conceptual
structure encoded in the embedding space, and a contextual trajectory shaped by
prompt-specific inference. Curved Inference reveals how models navigate,
reorient, or reinforce semantic meaning over depth, offering a principled
method for diagnosing alignment, abstraction, and emergent inference dynamics.
These findings offer fresh insight into semantic abstraction and model
alignment through the lens of Curved Inference.

clear need for automation. Automatic Legal Contract Classification (LCC)
revolutionizes the way legal contracts are analyzed, offering substantial
improvements in speed, accuracy, and accessibility. This survey delves into the
challenges of automatic LCC and a detailed examination of key tasks, datasets,
and methodologies. We identify seven classification tasks within LCC, and
review fourteen datasets related to English-language contracts, including
public, proprietary, and non-public sources. We also introduce a methodology
taxonomy for LCC, categorized into Traditional Machine Learning, Deep Learning,
and Transformer-based approaches. Additionally, the survey discusses evaluation
techniques and highlights the best-performing results from the reviewed
studies. By providing a thorough overview of current methods and their
limitations, this survey suggests future research directions to improve the
efficiency, accuracy, and scalability of LCC. As the first comprehensive survey
on LCC, it aims to support legal NLP researchers and practitioners in improving
legal processes, making legal information more accessible, and promoting a more

Conclusion: SemRAG提供高效、准确的领域特定LLM解决方案，避免资源密集型微调，具有可持续性和可扩展性。

Abstract: This paper introduces SemRAG, an enhanced Retrieval Augmented Generation
(RAG) framework that efficiently integrates domain-specific knowledge using
semantic chunking and knowledge graphs without extensive fine-tuning.
Integrating domain-specific knowledge into large language models (LLMs) is
crucial for improving their performance in specialized tasks. Yet, existing
adaptations are computationally expensive, prone to overfitting and limit
scalability. To address these challenges, SemRAG employs a semantic chunking
algorithm that segments documents based on the cosine similarity from sentence
embeddings, preserving semantic coherence while reducing computational
overhead. Additionally, by structuring retrieved information into knowledge
graphs, SemRAG captures relationships between entities, improving retrieval
accuracy and contextual understanding. Experimental results on MultiHop RAG and
Wikipedia datasets demonstrate SemRAG has significantly enhances the relevance
and correctness of retrieved information from the Knowledge Graph,
outperforming traditional RAG methods. Furthermore, we investigate the
optimization of buffer sizes for different data corpus, as optimizing buffer
sizes tailored to specific datasets can further improve retrieval performance,
as integration of knowledge graphs strengthens entity relationships for better
contextual comprehension. The primary advantage of SemRAG is its ability to
create an efficient, accurate domain-specific LLM pipeline while avoiding
resource-intensive fine-tuning. This makes it a practical and scalable approach
aligned with sustainability goals, offering a viable solution for AI
applications in domain-specific fields.

emerging applications within insurance operations with a focus on transforming
raw, unstructured text into structured data suitable for actuarial analysis and

apply various NLP techniques to demonstrate practical use cases in the
commercial insurance context. These enriched, text-derived insights not only
add to and refine traditional rating factors for commercial insurance pricing
but also offer novel perspectives for assessing underlying risk by introducing
novel industry classifications. Through these demonstrations, we show that NLP

Motivation: 随着LLM在法律、金融和医疗等高风险领域的广泛应用，系统评估其领域特定安全性和合规性变得至关重要。此前研究多关注性能提升，而忽视了安全风险。

Method: 基于AMA医疗伦理、ABA职业行为准则和CFA道德准则，定义了领域特定安全原则，并开发了Trident-Bench基准测试，评估了19个通用和领域专用模型。

Result: 测试显示，通用模型（如GPT、Gemini）能满足基本要求，而领域专用模型在细微伦理问题上表现不佳，凸显了领域特定安全改进的迫切需求。

Conclusion: Trident-Bench为研究LLM在法律和金融领域的安全性提供了系统资源，为未来减少LLM在专业监管领域的安全风险奠定了基础。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-risk
domains such as law, finance, and medicine, systematically evaluating their
domain-specific safety and compliance becomes critical. While prior work has
largely focused on improving LLM performance in these domains, it has often
neglected the evaluation of domain-specific safety risks. To bridge this gap,
we first define domain-specific safety principles for LLMs based on the AMA
Principles of Medical Ethics, the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct, and
the CFA Institute Code of Ethics. Building on this foundation, we introduce
Trident-Bench, a benchmark specifically targeting LLM safety in the legal,
financial, and medical domains. We evaluated 19 general-purpose and
domain-specialized models on Trident-Bench and show that it effectively reveals
key safety gaps -- strong generalist models (e.g., GPT, Gemini) can meet basic
expectations, whereas domain-specialized models often struggle with subtle
ethical nuances. This highlights an urgent need for finer-grained
domain-specific safety improvements. By introducing Trident-Bench, our work
provides one of the first systematic resources for studying LLM safety in law
and finance, and lays the groundwork for future research aimed at reducing the
safety risks of deploying LLMs in professionally regulated fields. Code and
benchmark will be released at: https://github.com/zackhuiiiii/TRIDENT

Result: 问题解释多样性在boolq、strategyqa和pubmedqa数据集上表现更优，模型多样性效果介于最佳和最差集成成员之间。

Conclusion: 问题解释多样性是更有效的多样性利用方式。

Abstract: Effectively leveraging diversity has been shown to improve performance for
various machine learning models, including large language models (LLMs).
However, determining the most effective way of using diversity remains a
challenge. In this work, we compare two diversity approaches for answering
binary questions using LLMs: model diversity, which relies on multiple models
answering the same question, and question interpretation diversity, which
relies on using the same model to answer the same question framed in different
ways. For both cases, we apply majority voting as the ensemble consensus
heuristic to determine the final answer. Our experiments on boolq, strategyqa,
and pubmedqa show that question interpretation diversity consistently leads to
better ensemble accuracy compared to model diversity. Furthermore, our analysis
of GPT and LLaMa shows that model diversity typically produces results between
the best and the worst ensemble members without clear improvement.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型的决策解释性较差，阻碍了其在现实应用中的可信和安全部署。现有的基于激活的归因方法容易受到类别无关特征的影响，导致解释不可靠。

Method: 提出Contrast-CAT方法，通过对比输入序列与参考激活，过滤掉类别无关特征，生成更清晰和可信的归因图。

Result: 实验结果显示，Contrast-CAT在多个数据集和模型上表现优于现有方法，尤其在MoRF设置下，AOPC和LOdds指标分别平均提升1.30倍和2.25倍。

Conclusion: Contrast-CAT显著提升了Transformer文本分类模型的可解释性，为实际应用提供了更可靠的解释工具。

Abstract: Transformers have profoundly influenced AI research, but explaining their
decisions remains challenging -- even for relatively simpler tasks such as
classification -- which hinders trust and safe deployment in real-world
applications. Although activation-based attribution methods effectively explain
transformer-based text classification models, our findings reveal that these
methods can be undermined by class-irrelevant features within activations,
leading to less reliable interpretations. To address this limitation, we
propose Contrast-CAT, a novel activation contrast-based attribution method that
refines token-level attributions by filtering out class-irrelevant features. By
contrasting the activations of an input sequence with reference activations,
Contrast-CAT generates clearer and more faithful attribution maps. Experimental
results across various datasets and models confirm that Contrast-CAT
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Notably, under the MoRF
setting, it achieves average improvements of x1.30 in AOPC and x2.25 in LOdds
over the most competing methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing
interpretability for transformer-based text classification.

TL;DR: 该研究利用XLM-RoBERTa Base架构的Transformer模型，对孟加拉语社交媒体评论进行情感分类，准确率达97%，并采用可解释AI技术增强模型理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动态变化的公众对犯罪相关新闻的情感，以支持公共政策制定和犯罪预防策略。

Method: 使用XLM-RoBERTa Base架构的Transformer模型，对28,528条孟加拉语社交媒体评论进行情感分类。

Result: 模型分类准确率达97%，优于现有方法，并通过可解释AI技术识别关键特征。

Conclusion: Transformer模型在处理低资源语言（如孟加拉语）时表现优异，能为公共政策提供实用见解。

Abstract: In recent years, social media platforms have become prominent spaces for
individuals to express their opinions on ongoing events, including criminal
incidents. As a result, public sentiment can shift dynamically over time. This
study investigates the evolving public perception of crime-related news by
classifying user-generated comments into three categories: positive, negative,
and neutral. A newly curated dataset comprising 28,528 Bangla-language social
media comments was developed for this purpose. We propose a transformer-based
model utilizing the XLM-RoBERTa Base architecture, which achieves a
classification accuracy of 97%, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods
in Bangla sentiment analysis. To enhance model interpretability, explainable AI
technique is employed to identify the most influential features driving
sentiment classification. The results underscore the effectiveness of
transformer-based models in processing low-resource languages such as Bengali
and demonstrate their potential to extract actionable insights that can support
public policy formulation and crime prevention strategies.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Bangla BERT的模型，用于检测孟加拉语中的超党派新闻，并通过半监督学习和LIME解释提高了准确性和透明度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前数字环境中，虚假信息快速传播，而孟加拉语缺乏有效的自然语言处理工具来识别超党派新闻，导致偏见内容传播风险加剧。

Method: 研究微调了Bangla BERT模型，结合半监督学习和LIME解释，与传统机器学习模型进行对比。

Result: Bangla BERT在试验数据中取得了95.65%的准确率，显著优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 研究表明，即使在资源有限的环境中，Transformer模型也能有效提升超党派新闻检测性能，为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: In the current digital landscape, misinformation circulates rapidly, shaping
public perception and causing societal divisions. It is difficult to identify
hyperpartisan news in Bangla since there aren't many sophisticated natural
language processing methods available for this low-resource language. Without
effective detection methods, biased content can spread unchecked, posing
serious risks to informed discourse. To address this gap, our research
fine-tunes Bangla BERT. This is a state-of-the-art transformer-based model,
designed to enhance classification accuracy for hyperpartisan news. We evaluate
its performance against traditional machine learning models and implement
semi-supervised learning to enhance predictions further. Not only that, we use
LIME to provide transparent explanations of the model's decision-making
process, which helps to build trust in its outcomes. With a remarkable accuracy
score of 95.65%, Bangla BERT outperforms conventional approaches, according to
our trial data. The findings of this study demonstrate the usefulness of
transformer models even in environments with limited resources, which opens the
door to further improvements in this area.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了基于人类临床理由的额外监督是否能提升基于Transformer的临床文本分类模型的性能和可解释性。结果显示，在高资源情况下，临床理由能提升性能，但在资源有限时效果不一致。使用理由作为训练数据的效果不如直接增加报告数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索人类临床理由是否能作为额外监督，提升临床文本分类模型的性能和可解释性。

Method: 分析了99,125条人类临床理由和128,649份电子病理报告，评估了基于Transformer的模型在提取原发癌症部位时的表现，并研究了理由质量的衡量方法。

Result: 临床理由在高资源情况下能提升性能，但在资源有限时效果不一致。使用理由作为训练数据的效果不如直接增加报告数量。

Conclusion: 若目标是优化准确性，应优先标注更多报告而非创建理由；若目标是可解释性，理由可能有助于模型识别类似理由的特征。

Abstract: AI-driven clinical text classification is vital for explainable automated
retrieval of population-level health information. This work investigates
whether human-based clinical rationales can serve as additional supervision to
improve both performance and explainability of transformer-based models that
automatically encode clinical documents. We analyzed 99,125 human-based
clinical rationales that provide plausible explanations for primary cancer site
diagnoses, using them as additional training samples alongside 128,649
electronic pathology reports to evaluate transformer-based models for
extracting primary cancer sites. We also investigated sufficiency as a way to
measure rationale quality for pre-selecting rationales. Our results showed that
clinical rationales as additional training data can improve model performance
in high-resource scenarios but produce inconsistent behavior when resources are
limited. Using sufficiency as an automatic metric to preselect rationales also
leads to inconsistent results. Importantly, models trained on rationales were
consistently outperformed by models trained on additional reports instead. This
suggests that clinical rationales don't consistently improve model performance
and are outperformed by simply using more reports. Therefore, if the goal is
optimizing accuracy, annotation efforts should focus on labeling more reports
rather than creating rationales. However, if explainability is the priority,
training models on rationale-supplemented data may help them better identify
rationale-like features. We conclude that using clinical rationales as
additional training data results in smaller performance improvements and only
slightly better explainability (measured as average token-level rationale
coverage) compared to training on additional reports.

TL;DR: 研究发现，当前大语言模型（LLMs）在捕捉跨文化道德差异方面表现不佳，倾向于压缩差异且与实证调查数据对齐度低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs是否能够准确反映跨文化道德视角的差异与相似性，以解决其潜在偏见问题。

Method: 采用三种方法：比较模型与调查数据的道德评分方差、聚类对齐分析、以及直接通过系统性选择的词对提示模型。

Result: LLMs未能全面再现跨文化道德差异，且与实证调查模式对齐度低。

Conclusion: 需改进LLMs的文化代表性和减少偏见，以确保其公平和伦理对齐的全球部署。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have established them as
powerful tools across numerous domains. However, persistent concerns about
embedded biases, such as gender, racial, and cultural biases arising from their
training data, raise significant questions about the ethical use and societal
consequences of these technologies. This study investigates the extent to which
LLMs capture cross-cultural differences and similarities in moral perspectives.
Specifically, we examine whether LLM outputs align with patterns observed in
international survey data on moral attitudes. To this end, we employ three
complementary methods: (1) comparing variances in moral scores produced by
models versus those reported in surveys, (2) conducting cluster alignment
analyses to assess correspondence between country groupings derived from LLM
outputs and survey data, and (3) directly probing models with comparative
prompts using systematically chosen token pairs. Our results reveal that
current LLMs often fail to reproduce the full spectrum of cross-cultural moral
variation, tending to compress differences and exhibit low alignment with
empirical survey patterns. These findings highlight a pressing need for more
robust approaches to mitigate biases and improve cultural representativeness in
LLMs. We conclude by discussing the implications for the responsible
development and global deployment of LLMs, emphasizing fairness and ethical
alignment.

TL;DR: StructText是一个自动生成高质量基准的框架，用于从文本中提取键值对，利用现有表格数据生成自然语言文本，并通过多维度评估确保对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏针对特定领域或组织的文本提取质量评估基准，手动标注成本高且难以扩展。

Method: 采用两阶段“计划-执行”流程，利用表格数据生成自然语言文本，并通过LLM和客观指标进行多维度评估。

Result: 在71,539个示例中，LLM在事实准确性上表现良好，但在叙事连贯性和自动提取方面存在困难。

Conclusion: StructText为文本提取研究提供了框架、数据集和工具，支持进一步研究。

Abstract: Extracting structured information from text, such as key-value pairs that
could augment tabular data, is quite useful in many enterprise use cases.
Although large language models (LLMs) have enabled numerous automated pipelines
for converting natural language into structured formats, there is still a lack
of benchmarks for evaluating their extraction quality, especially in specific
domains or focused documents specific to a given organization. Building such
benchmarks by manual annotations is labour-intensive and limits the size and
scalability of the benchmarks. In this work, we present StructText, an
end-to-end framework for automatically generating high-fidelity benchmarks for
key-value extraction from text using existing tabular data. It uses available
tabular data as structured ground truth, and follows a two-stage
``plan-then-execute'' pipeline to synthetically generate corresponding
natural-language text. To ensure alignment between text and structured source,
we introduce a multi-dimensional evaluation strategy that combines (a)
LLM-based judgments on factuality, hallucination, and coherence and (b)
objective extraction metrics measuring numeric and temporal accuracy. We
evaluated the proposed method on 71,539 examples across 49 datasets. Results
reveal that while LLMs achieve strong factual accuracy and avoid hallucination,
they struggle with narrative coherence in producing extractable text. Notably,
models presume numerical and temporal information with high fidelity yet this
information becomes embedded in narratives that resist automated extraction. We
release a framework, including datasets, evaluation tools, and baseline
extraction systems, to support continued research.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的网页历史压缩方法，通过压缩历史状态中的任务相关信息，提升网页自动化效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有网页自动化方法忽略了历史状态的重要性，且网页状态信息冗长导致输入序列过长和信息稀疏。

Method: 采用历史压缩模块，将每个历史状态中最相关的任务信息压缩为固定长度的短表示。

Result: 在Mind2Web和WebLINX数据集上实验，相比无历史输入的基线方法，绝对准确率提升1.2-5.4%。

Conclusion: 历史压缩方法有效解决了网页状态冗长问题，显著提升了网页自动化的准确性。

Abstract: Language models have led to a leap forward in web automation. The current web
automation approaches take the current web state, history actions, and language
instruction as inputs to predict the next action, overlooking the importance of
history states. However, the highly verbose nature of web page states can
result in long input sequences and sparse information, hampering the effective
utilization of history states. In this paper, we propose a novel web history
compressor approach to turbocharge web automation using history states. Our
approach employs a history compressor module that distills the most
task-relevant information from each history state into a fixed-length short
representation, mitigating the challenges posed by the highly verbose history
states. Experiments are conducted on the Mind2Web and WebLINX datasets to
evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. Results show that our approach
obtains 1.2-5.4% absolute accuracy improvements compared to the baseline
approach without history inputs.

TL;DR: MemTool是一个短期记忆框架，帮助LLM代理在多轮对话中动态管理工具或MCP服务器上下文，提供三种架构模式，并在实验中展示了不同模式在工具移除效率和任务完成准确性上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 固定上下文窗口限制了多轮交互中重复独立使用工具的效果，因此需要一种动态管理工具上下文的解决方案。

Method: 提出了MemTool框架，包含三种代理架构模式：自主代理模式、工作流模式和混合模式，并在ScaleMCP基准上评估了这些模式的表现。

Result: 自主代理模式在大型模型上工具移除效率高（90-94%），而中型模型效率低（0-60%）；工作流和混合模式在工具移除上表现一致，自主和混合模式在任务完成上更优。

Conclusion: MemTool为不同任务需求提供了权衡和推荐模式，基于任务准确性、代理能力和模型性能。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have shown significant autonomous
capabilities in dynamically searching and incorporating relevant tools or Model
Context Protocol (MCP) servers for individual queries. However, fixed context
windows limit effectiveness in multi-turn interactions requiring repeated,
independent tool usage. We introduce MemTool, a short-term memory framework
enabling LLM agents to dynamically manage tools or MCP server contexts across
multi-turn conversations. MemTool offers three agentic architectures: 1)
Autonomous Agent Mode, granting full tool management autonomy, 2) Workflow
Mode, providing deterministic control without autonomy, and 3) Hybrid Mode,
combining autonomous and deterministic control. Evaluating each MemTool mode
across 13+ LLMs on the ScaleMCP benchmark, we conducted experiments over 100
consecutive user interactions, measuring tool removal ratios (short-term memory
efficiency) and task completion accuracy. In Autonomous Agent Mode, reasoning
LLMs achieve high tool-removal efficiency (90-94% over a 3-window average),
while medium-sized models exhibit significantly lower efficiency (0-60%).
Workflow and Hybrid modes consistently manage tool removal effectively, whereas
Autonomous and Hybrid modes excel at task completion. We present trade-offs and
recommendations for each MemTool mode based on task accuracy, agency, and model
capabilities.

Motivation: 研究旨在开发一种兼具高预测准确性和解释性的本地可部署LLM，以支持交通研究和政策制定，同时保护隐私并降低成本。

Method: 通过系统评估11种LLM（1-12B参数）在三个数据集上的表现，测试了396种配置，生成了79,000多个合成预测。LiTransMC采用参数高效和损失掩码策略进行微调。

Result: LiTransMC在加权F1分数（0.6845）和Jensen-Shannon散度（0.000245）上优于未调优本地模型和大型专有系统（如GPT-4o），同时超越了传统方法（如离散选择模型）。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过结合结构化行为预测和自然语言推理，可以开发出兼具高准确性和解释性的本地可部署LLM，为交通研究和政策制定提供新工具。

Abstract: This study investigates the adoption of open-access, locally deployable
causal large language models (LLMs) for travel mode choice prediction and
introduces LiTransMC, the first fine-tuned causal LLM developed for this task.
We systematically benchmark eleven LLMs (1-12B parameters) across three stated
and revealed preference datasets, testing 396 configurations and generating
over 79,000 synthetic commuter predictions. Beyond predictive accuracy, we
evaluate models generated reasoning using BERTopic for topic modelling and a
novel Explanation Strength Index, providing the first structured analysis of
how LLMs articulate decision factors in alignment with behavioural theory.
LiTransMC, fine-tuned using parameter efficient and loss masking strategy,
achieved a weighted F1 score of 0.6845 and a Jensen-Shannon Divergence of
0.000245, surpassing both untuned local models and larger proprietary systems,
including GPT-4o with advanced persona inference and embedding-based loading,
while also outperforming classical mode choice methods such as discrete choice
models and machine learning classifiers for the same dataset. This dual
improvement, i.e., high instant-level accuracy and near-perfect distributional
calibration, demonstrates the feasibility of creating specialist, locally
deployable LLMs that integrate prediction and interpretability. Through
combining structured behavioural prediction with natural language reasoning,
this work unlocks the potential for conversational, multi-task transport models
capable of supporting agent-based simulations, policy testing, and behavioural
insight generation. These findings establish a pathway for transforming general
purpose LLMs into specialized, explainable tools for transportation research
and policy formulation, while maintaining privacy, reducing cost, and
broadening access through local deployment.

Motivation: 随着LLM在STEM领域基准测试中表现饱和，需要新颖且具有挑战性的评估来测试模型在非STEM领域（如幽默理解）的智能。

Method: HumorBench包含来自New Yorker Caption Contest和Cartoonstock.com的300个卡通-标题对，专家标注了笑话要素。LLM通过解释幽默和识别笑话要素来评估。

Result: 研究发现：(1) LLM在STEM推理上的进步能有效转移到幽默理解；(2) 仅在STEM数据上训练的模型在HumorBench上表现良好；(3) 增加推理令牌预算对幽默推理效果不一。

Conclusion: HumorBench为评估LLM在复杂幽默推理中的能力提供了新基准，并揭示了推理能力的可迁移性和局限性。

Abstract: We present HumorBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate large language
models' (LLMs) ability to reason about and explain sophisticated humor in
cartoon captions. As reasoning models increasingly saturate existing benchmarks
in mathematics and science, novel and challenging evaluations of model
intelligence beyond STEM domains are essential. Reasoning is fundamentally
involved in text-based humor comprehension, requiring the identification of
connections between concepts in cartoons/captions and external cultural
references, wordplays, and other mechanisms. HumorBench includes approximately
300 unique cartoon-caption pairs from the New Yorker Caption Contest and
Cartoonstock.com, with expert-annotated evaluation rubrics identifying
essential joke elements. LLMs are evaluated based on their explanations towards
the humor and abilities in identifying the joke elements. To perform well on
this task, models must form and test hypotheses about associations between
concepts, potentially backtracking from initial interpretations to arrive at
the most plausible explanation. Our extensive benchmarking of current SOTA
models reveals three key insights: (1) LLM progress on STEM reasoning transfers
effectively to humor comprehension; (2) models trained exclusively on STEM
reasoning data still perform well on HumorBench, demonstrating strong
transferability of reasoning abilities; and (3) test-time scaling by increasing
thinking token budgets yields mixed results across different models in humor
reasoning.

Result: 在MMLU任务上准确率提升4%，标注成本降低80%，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法简单高效，显著降低标注需求，同时提升模型性能，适用于多种任务和数据集。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse domains, but developing high-performing models for specialized
applications often requires substantial human annotation -- a process that is
time-consuming, labor-intensive, and expensive. In this paper, we address the
label-efficient learning problem for supervised finetuning (SFT) by leveraging
task-diversity as a fundamental principle for effective data selection. This is
markedly different from existing methods based on the prompt-diversity. Our
approach is based on two key observations: 1) task labels for different prompts
are often readily available; 2) pre-trained models have significantly varying
levels of confidence across tasks. We combine these facts to devise a simple
yet effective sampling strategy: we select examples across tasks using an
inverse confidence weighting strategy. This produces models comparable to or
better than those trained with more complex sampling procedures, while being
significantly easier to implement and less computationally intensive. Notably,
our experimental results demonstrate that this method can achieve better
accuracy than training on the complete dataset (a 4\% increase in MMLU score).
Across various annotation budgets and two instruction finetuning datasets, our
algorithm consistently performs at or above the level of the best existing
methods, while reducing annotation costs by up to 80\%.

Motivation: 越南互联网环境复杂，缺乏适合的大规模测试数据集，阻碍了AI模型的有效评估和部署。

Method: 利用大型语言模型（LLMs）和先进嵌入模型翻译并过滤英语样本，确保语言流畅性和语义保真度，保留命名实体识别（NER）和代码片段。

Result: 构建了包含41个数据集的越南文本嵌入基准，发现使用旋转位置嵌入的更大更复杂模型表现更优。

Conclusion: VN-MTEB为越南嵌入模型提供了高质量评估基准，有助于推动实际应用中的模型优化。

Abstract: Vietnam ranks among the top countries in terms of both internet traffic and
online toxicity. As a result, implementing embedding models for recommendation
and content control duties in applications is crucial. However, a lack of
large-scale test datasets, both in volume and task diversity, makes it tricky
for scientists to effectively evaluate AI models before deploying them in
real-world, large-scale projects. To solve this important problem, we introduce
a Vietnamese benchmark, VN-MTEB for embedding models, which we created by
translating a large number of English samples from the Massive Text Embedding
Benchmark using our new automated framework. We leverage the strengths of large
language models (LLMs) and cutting-edge embedding models to conduct translation
and filtering processes to retain high-quality samples, guaranteeing a natural
flow of language and semantic fidelity while preserving named entity
recognition (NER) and code snippets. Our comprehensive benchmark consists of 41
datasets from six tasks specifically designed for Vietnamese text embeddings.
In our analysis, we find that bigger and more complex models using Rotary
Positional Embedding outperform those using Absolute Positional Embedding in
embedding tasks. Datasets are available at HuggingFace:

Result: 发现finetuning后的人格变化与persona vectors相关，可通过干预或预防方法控制。

Conclusion: persona vectors可用于自动化监控和预防不良人格变化，适用于任何感兴趣的人格特质。

Abstract: Large language models interact with users through a simulated 'Assistant'
persona. While the Assistant is typically trained to be helpful, harmless, and
honest, it sometimes deviates from these ideals. In this paper, we identify
directions in the model's activation space-persona vectors-underlying several
traits, such as evil, sycophancy, and propensity to hallucinate. We confirm
that these vectors can be used to monitor fluctuations in the Assistant's
personality at deployment time. We then apply persona vectors to predict and
control personality shifts that occur during training. We find that both
intended and unintended personality changes after finetuning are strongly
correlated with shifts along the relevant persona vectors. These shifts can be
mitigated through post-hoc intervention, or avoided in the first place with a
new preventative steering method. Moreover, persona vectors can be used to flag
training data that will produce undesirable personality changes, both at the
dataset level and the individual sample level. Our method for extracting
persona vectors is automated and can be applied to any personality trait of
interest, given only a natural-language description.

TL;DR: TriangleMix是一种无需训练的静态注意力模式，通过在浅层使用密集注意力、深层使用三角形稀疏模式，显著降低计算开销，同时保持模型准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有静态稀疏注意力方法通常降低准确性，而动态稀疏方法因运行时稀疏索引估计引入额外计算开销。TriangleMix旨在解决这些限制。

Method: TriangleMix在浅层使用密集注意力，深层切换为三角形稀疏模式，无需训练即可实现。

Result: 实验表明，TriangleMix在深层减少注意力开销3.7x至15.3x，整体TTFT降低12%至32%，且不牺牲准确性。

Conclusion: TriangleMix可无缝结合动态稀疏方法进一步提升效率，展示了增强LLM推理效率的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on attention mechanisms whose time
complexity grows quadratically with input sequence length, creating significant
computational bottlenecks during the prefilling stage. Existing static sparse
attention methods typically degrade accuracy, while dynamic sparsity methods
introduce additional computational overhead due to runtime sparse index
estimation. To address these limitations, we propose TriangleMix, a novel
training-free static attention pattern. TriangleMix employs dense attention in
shallow layers and switches to a triangle-shaped sparse pattern in deeper
layers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TriangleMix reduces attention
overhead by 3.7x to 15.3x in deep layers, and decreases overall
Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) by 12% to 32% for sequence lengths ranging from 32K
to 128K, without sacrificing model accuracy. Moreover, TriangleMix can be
seamlessly integrated with dynamic sparsity methods to achieve further speedup,
e.g. accelerating MInference by 19% at 128K, highlighting its potential to
enhance LLM inference efficiency.

Motivation: NLP技术在需求工程中的应用日益广泛，但相关研究的可复制性未得到足够关注。通过复制和扩展研究，可以验证结果的可靠性并探索新机会。

Method: 复制并扩展了基线研究，使用公开源代码重现结果，并评估了模型在外部数据集上的表现，同时比较了GPT-4零样本分类器。

Result: 不同模型的可复制性水平各异，BERT和ELMo表现出良好的泛化能力，GPT-4性能与传统基线模型相当。基线研究的可复制性得到确认，但环境设置文件缺失。

Conclusion: 研究验证了基线研究的可复制性，并提供了扩展结果和复制包，以支持未来研究的复制工作。

Abstract: Natural language processing (NLP) techniques have been widely applied in the
requirements engineering (RE) field to support tasks such as classification and
ambiguity detection. Although RE research is rooted in empirical investigation,
it has paid limited attention to replicating NLP for RE (NLP4RE) studies. The
rapidly advancing realm of NLP is creating new opportunities for efficient,
machine-assisted workflows, which can bring new perspectives and results to the
forefront. Thus, we replicate and extend a previous NLP4RE study (baseline),
"Classifying User Requirements from Online Feedback in Small Dataset
Environments using Deep Learning", which evaluated different deep learning
models for requirement classification from user reviews. We reproduced the
original results using publicly released source code, thereby helping to
strengthen the external validity of the baseline study. We then extended the
setup by evaluating model performance on an external dataset and comparing
results to a GPT-4o zero-shot classifier. Furthermore, we prepared the
replication study ID-card for the baseline study, important for evaluating
replication readiness. Results showed diverse reproducibility levels across
different models, with Naive Bayes demonstrating perfect reproducibility. In
contrast, BERT and other models showed mixed results. Our findings revealed
that baseline deep learning models, BERT and ELMo, exhibited good
generalization capabilities on an external dataset, and GPT-4o showed
performance comparable to traditional baseline machine learning models.
Additionally, our assessment confirmed the baseline study's replication
readiness; however missing environment setup files would have further enhanced
readiness. We include this missing information in our replication package and
provide the replication study ID-card for our study to further encourage and
support the replication of our study.

*Jiaxin Zuo,Yiquan Wang,Yuan Pan,Xiadiya Yibulayin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究为维吾尔语NLP设计了一个依赖标注框架，填补了资源空白，并通过实验验证了其必要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决维吾尔语这一低资源、黏着语在自然语言处理中的资源不足问题。

Method: 提出了包含18种主关系和26种子类型的标注框架，并通过预训练的通用依赖解析器进行跨标准评估。

Result: 实验显示标注差异达47.9%，证明了通用方案对维吾尔语结构的不足。

Conclusion: 现代维吾尔语依赖树库（MUDT）提供了更准确的语义表示，并为其他形态复杂语言提供了可复制的模型。

Abstract: To address a critical resource gap in Uyghur Natural Language Processing
(NLP), this study introduces a dependency annotation framework designed to
overcome the limitations of existing treebanks for the low-resource,
agglutinative language. This inventory includes 18 main relations and 26
subtypes, with specific labels such as cop:zero for verbless clauses and
instr:case=loc/dat for nuanced instrumental functions. To empirically validate
the necessity of this tailored approach, we conducted a cross-standard
evaluation using a pre-trained Universal Dependencies parser. The analysis
revealed a systematic 47.9% divergence in annotations, pinpointing the
inadequacy of universal schemes for handling Uyghur-specific structures.
Grounded in nine annotation principles that ensure typological accuracy and
semantic transparency, the Modern Uyghur Dependency Treebank (MUDT) provides a
more accurate and semantically transparent representation, designed to enable
significant improvements in parsing and downstream NLP tasks, and offers a
replicable model for other morphologically complex languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于知识图谱（KG）的框架MAGIC，用于生成多样且微妙的知识冲突，以解决现有基准在RAG系统中的局限性。实验表明，LLMs在冲突检测和多跳推理方面表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准在RAG系统中存在局限性，如仅关注问答设置、依赖实体替换技术及冲突类型有限，需提出更全面的解决方案。

Method: 采用知识图谱框架生成多样且微妙的冲突，确保通过KG的显式关系结构实现可解释性。

Result: 实验表明，开源和专有LLMs在冲突检测和多跳推理方面表现不佳，且难以定位矛盾来源。

Conclusion: 研究为改进LLMs在整合多样化（甚至冲突）信息方面提供了基础分析。

Abstract: Knowledge conflict often arises in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
systems, where retrieved documents may be inconsistent with one another or
contradict the model's parametric knowledge. Existing benchmarks for
investigating the phenomenon have notable limitations, including a narrow focus
on the question answering setup, heavy reliance on entity substitution
techniques, and a restricted range of conflict types. To address these issues,
we propose a knowledge graph (KG)-based framework that generates varied and
subtle conflicts between two similar yet distinct contexts, while ensuring
interpretability through the explicit relational structure of KGs. Experimental
results on our benchmark, MAGIC, provide intriguing insights into the inner
workings of LLMs regarding knowledge conflict: both open-source and proprietary
models struggle with conflict detection -- especially when multi-hop reasoning
is required -- and often fail to pinpoint the exact source of contradictions.
Finally, we present in-depth analyses that serve as a foundation for improving
LLMs in integrating diverse, sometimes even conflicting, information.

*Akhilesh Kakolu Ramarao,Kevin Tang,Dinah Baer-Henney*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究比较了基于Transformer的神经网络与人类行为数据，探讨西班牙语不规则形态模式的认知合理性。模型在词干和后缀准确率上优于人类，但在反应偏好上存在明显差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证Transformer模型是否能复现人类对复杂语言现象（形态模式）的敏感性。

Method: 使用与人类研究相同的分析框架，评估模型在自然、低频和高频动词分布下的表现。

Result: 模型在准确率上优于人类，但反应偏好不同；模型受训练数据中不规则动词比例影响，且对音系相似性敏感。

Conclusion: 模型与人类在语言处理上存在差异，需进一步研究以理解其认知合理性。

Abstract: This study investigates the cognitive plausibility of the Spanish irregular
morphomic pattern by directly comparing transformer-based neural networks to
human behavioral data from \citet{Nevins2015TheRA}. Using the same analytical
framework as the original human study, we evaluate whether transformer models
can replicate human-like sensitivity to a complex linguistic phenomena, the
morphome, under controlled input conditions. Our experiments focus on three
frequency conditions: natural, low-frequency, and high-frequency distributions
of verbs exhibiting irregular morphomic patterns. While the models outperformed
humans in stem and suffix accuracy, a clear divergence emerged in response
preferences. Unlike humans, who consistently favored natural responses across
all test items, models' preferred irregular responses and were influenced by
the proportion of irregular verbs in their training data. Additionally, models
trained on the natural and low-frequency distributions, but not the
high-frequency distribution, were sensitive to the phonological similarity
between test items and real Spanish L-shaped verbs.

*Aarón Galiano-Jiménez,Juan Antonio Pérez-Ortiz,Felipe Sánchez-Martínez,Víctor M. Sánchez-Cartagena*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多假设蒸馏（MHD）方法，通过生成多个翻译句子来改进序列级知识蒸馏（KD），提升学生模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 教师模型的输出分布包含丰富信息，而传统束搜索方法仅提供近似模式，限制了学生模型的学习潜力。

Method: 利用束搜索的n-best列表生成多个翻译，增加目标侧前缀的多样性，并探索其他解码方法以解决低频词和低变异性问题。

Result: 在低资源语言中，采样方法虽略微降低翻译质量，但增加了语料库的多样性和词汇丰富性，提升了学生模型性能并减少性别偏见放大。

Conclusion: MHD方法通过多假设蒸馏有效提升了学生模型的表现，尤其在低资源语言中表现出色。

Abstract: This paper explores sequence-level knowledge distillation (KD) of
multilingual pre-trained encoder-decoder translation models. We argue that the
teacher model's output distribution holds valuable insights for the student,
beyond the approximated mode obtained through beam search (the standard
decoding method), and present Multi-Hypothesis Distillation (MHD), a
sequence-level KD method that generates multiple translations for each source
sentence. This provides a larger representation of the teacher model
distribution and exposes the student model to a wider range of target-side
prefixes. We leverage $n$-best lists from beam search to guide the student's
learning and examine alternative decoding methods to address issues like low
variability and the under-representation of infrequent tokens. For low-resource
languages, our research shows that while sampling methods may slightly
compromise translation quality compared to beam search based approaches, they
enhance the generated corpora with greater variability and lexical richness.
This ultimately improves student model performance and mitigates the gender
bias amplification often associated with KD.

Conclusion: JobBERT-V3在跨语言职位匹配中表现优秀，并具备技能排名等扩展应用潜力。

Abstract: We introduce JobBERT-V3, a contrastive learning-based model for cross-lingual
job title matching. Building on the state-of-the-art monolingual JobBERT-V2,
our approach extends support to English, German, Spanish, and Chinese by
leveraging synthetic translations and a balanced multilingual dataset of over
21 million job titles. The model retains the efficiency-focused architecture of
its predecessor while enabling robust alignment across languages without
requiring task-specific supervision. Extensive evaluations on the TalentCLEF
2025 benchmark demonstrate that JobBERT-V3 outperforms strong multilingual
baselines and achieves consistent performance across both monolingual and
cross-lingual settings. While not the primary focus, we also show that the
model can be effectively used to rank relevant skills for a given job title,
demonstrating its broader applicability in multilingual labor market
intelligence. The model is publicly available:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前奖励模型在复杂推理场景中表现不佳，且依赖精细标注的参考答案和受限的输出格式，限制了强化学习数据的扩展和模型推理能力的持续提升。

Method: 构建推理导向的基准（Libra Bench），并提出一种通过学习思考方法改进生成奖励模型的新方法，开发了Libra-RM系列模型。

Result: Libra-RM系列模型在多个基准测试中取得了最先进的结果，实验证明了Libra Bench与下游应用的相关性，以及Libra-RM利用未标记数据进一步提升推理模型的潜力。

Conclusion: 提出的框架和方法有效解决了当前奖励模型的局限性，为复杂推理场景中的强化学习提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has significantly improved the reasoning ability
of large language models. However, current reward models underperform in
challenging reasoning scenarios and predominant RL training paradigms rely on
rule-based or reference-based rewards, which impose two critical limitations:
1) the dependence on finely annotated reference answer to attain rewards; and
2) the requirement for constrained output format. These limitations
fundamentally hinder further RL data scaling and sustained enhancement of model
reasoning performance. To address these limitations, we propose a comprehensive
framework for evaluating and improving the performance of reward models in
complex reasoning scenarios. We first present a reasoning-oriented benchmark
(Libra Bench), systematically constructed from a diverse collection of
challenging mathematical problems and advanced reasoning models, to address the
limitations of existing reward model benchmarks in reasoning scenarios. We
further introduce a novel approach for improving the generative reward model
via learning-to-think methodologies. Based on the proposed approach, we develop
Libra-RM series, a collection of generative reward models with reasoning
capabilities that achieve state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks.
Comprehensive downstream experiments are conducted and the experimental results
demonstrate the correlation between our Libra Bench and downstream application,
and the potential of Libra-RM to further improve reasoning models with
unlabeled data.

*Raj Vardhan Tomar,Preslav Nakov,Yuxia Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: UnsafeChain是一个针对大型推理模型（LRMs）的安全对齐数据集，通过纠正有害输出来提升模型安全性，同时保持推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全对齐研究主要关注过滤安全提示，而忽略了总是引发有害输出的硬提示。UnsafeChain填补了这一空白。

Method: 构建UnsafeChain数据集，包含多样化的硬提示，并明确纠正有害输出为安全响应。对三个LRMs进行微调，并与SafeChain和STAR-1进行比较。

Result: UnsafeChain在多个基准测试中表现优于现有数据集，甚至1K子集也能匹配或超越基线性能。

Conclusion: 基于纠正的监督方法有效且具有泛化能力，UnsafeChain为模型安全对齐提供了新思路。

Abstract: As large reasoning models (LRMs) grow more capable, chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning introduces new safety challenges. Existing SFT-based safety alignment
studies dominantly focused on filtering prompts with safe, high-quality
responses, while overlooking hard prompts that always elicit harmful outputs.
To fill this gap, we introduce UnsafeChain, a safety alignment dataset
constructed from hard prompts with diverse sources, where unsafe completions
are identified and explicitly corrected into safe responses. By exposing models
to unsafe behaviors and guiding their correction, UnsafeChain enhances safety
while preserving general reasoning ability. We fine-tune three LRMs on
UnsafeChain and compare them against recent SafeChain and STAR-1 across six
out-of-distribution and five in-distribution benchmarks. UnsafeChain
consistently outperforms prior datasets, with even a 1K subset matching or
surpassing baseline performance, demonstrating the effectiveness and
generalizability of correction-based supervision. We release our dataset and
code at https://github.com/mbzuai-nlp/UnsafeChain

*Yang Wang,Chenghao Xiao,Yizhi Li,Stuart E. Middleton,Noura Al Moubayed,Chenghua Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种简单有效的模块，通过移除实例级主成分来增强预训练语言模型的对抗鲁棒性，无需依赖传统防御方法或扰动训练数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练语言模型（PLMs）在实际应用中易受对抗攻击影响，现有方法虽能提升鲁棒性，但计算成本高。

Method: 通过移除实例级主成分，将嵌入空间转换为近似高斯分布，减少对抗扰动的敏感性，同时保留语义关系。

Result: 在八个基准数据集上验证，该方法提升了对抗鲁棒性，同时保持了与基线相当的原始准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法在鲁棒性和泛化性之间实现了平衡，无需对抗样本或昂贵的训练增强。

Abstract: Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have driven substantial progress in
natural language processing but remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
raising concerns about their robustness in real-world applications. Previous
studies have sought to mitigate the impact of adversarial attacks by
introducing adversarial perturbations into the training process, either
implicitly or explicitly. While both strategies enhance robustness, they often
incur high computational costs. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective
add-on module that enhances the adversarial robustness of PLMs by removing
instance-level principal components, without relying on conventional
adversarial defences or perturbing the original training data. Our approach
transforms the embedding space to approximate Gaussian properties, thereby
reducing its susceptibility to adversarial perturbations while preserving
semantic relationships. This transformation aligns embedding distributions in a
way that minimises the impact of adversarial noise on decision boundaries,
enhancing robustness without requiring adversarial examples or costly
training-time augmentation. Evaluations on eight benchmark datasets show that
our approach improves adversarial robustness while maintaining comparable
before-attack accuracy to baselines, achieving a balanced trade-off between
robustness and generalisation.

Conclusion: AgriEval揭示了农业LLMs的发展潜力，并提出了性能提升策略。

Abstract: In the agricultural domain, the deployment of large language models (LLMs) is
hindered by the lack of training data and evaluation benchmarks. To mitigate
this issue, we propose AgriEval, the first comprehensive Chinese agricultural
benchmark with three main characteristics: (1) Comprehensive Capability
Evaluation. AgriEval covers six major agriculture categories and 29
subcategories within agriculture, addressing four core cognitive scenarios:
memorization, understanding, inference, and generation. (2) High-Quality Data.
The dataset is curated from university-level examinations and assignments,
providing a natural and robust benchmark for assessing the capacity of LLMs to
apply knowledge and make expert-like decisions. (3) Diverse Formats and
Extensive Scale. AgriEval comprises 14,697 multiple-choice questions and 2,167
open-ended question-and-answer questions, establishing it as the most extensive
agricultural benchmark available to date. We also present comprehensive
experimental results over 51 open-source and commercial LLMs. The experimental
results reveal that most existing LLMs struggle to achieve 60% accuracy,
underscoring the developmental potential in agricultural LLMs. Additionally, we
conduct extensive experiments to investigate factors influencing model
performance and propose strategies for enhancement. AgriEval is available at

Motivation: 当前缺乏对安全分类模型及其评估数据集在多语言场景下有效性的研究，亟需填补这一空白。

Method: 通过分析覆盖18种语言的数据集，评估5个安全分类模型的多语言差异。

Result: 发现多语言差异及评估数据集的潜在问题，指出安全分类模型的不足不仅源于模型本身。

Conclusion: 研究结果有助于推动开发更有效的多语言有害内容识别方法。

Abstract: Studying the robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs) to unsafe behaviors
is an important topic of research today. Building safety classification models
or guard models, which are fine-tuned models for input/output safety
classification for LLMs, is seen as one of the solutions to address the issue.
Although there is a lot of research on the safety testing of LLMs themselves,
there is little research on evaluating the effectiveness of such safety
classifiers or the evaluation datasets used for testing them, especially in
multilingual scenarios. In this position paper, we demonstrate how multilingual
disparities exist in 5 safety classification models by considering datasets
covering 18 languages. At the same time, we identify potential issues with the
evaluation datasets, arguing that the shortcomings of current safety
classifiers are not only because of the models themselves. We expect that these
findings will contribute to the discussion on developing better methods to
identify harmful content in LLM inputs across languages.

Abstract: Chart annotations enhance visualization accessibility but suffer from
fragmented, non-standardized representations that limit cross-platform reuse.
We propose ChartMark, a structured grammar that separates annotation semantics

Result: 当前最先进的LLM在提供准确信息方面表现不佳，且可能带来严重安全风险。

Conclusion: 在减少伤害场景中使用LLM需谨慎，以避免负面健康后果。

Abstract: Millions of individuals' well-being are challenged by the harms of substance
use. Harm reduction as a public health strategy is designed to improve their
health outcomes and reduce safety risks. Some large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated a decent level of medical knowledge, promising to address the
information needs of people who use drugs (PWUD). However, their performance in
relevant tasks remains largely unexplored. We introduce HRIPBench, a benchmark
designed to evaluate LLM's accuracy and safety risks in harm reduction
information provision. The benchmark dataset HRIP-Basic has 2,160
question-answer-evidence pairs. The scope covers three tasks: checking safety
boundaries, providing quantitative values, and inferring polysubstance use
risks. We build the Instruction and RAG schemes to evaluate model behaviours
based on their inherent knowledge and the integration of domain knowledge. Our
results indicate that state-of-the-art LLMs still struggle to provide accurate
harm reduction information, and sometimes, carry out severe safety risks to
PWUD. The use of LLMs in harm reduction contexts should be cautiously
constrained to avoid inducing negative health outcomes. WARNING: This paper
contains illicit content that potentially induces harms.

Motivation: 研究事件合理性变化对对话生成、常识推理和幻觉检测等任务的重要性，以更准确地建模如朋友间“温和讽刺”等复杂现象。

Method: 使用句子转换器和基于转换器的模型（如RoBERTa）对ADEPT挑战基准中的16K英语句子对进行建模实验。

Result: 句子转换器和基于转换器的模型在此任务上表现不佳，句子转换器甚至不如RoBERTa。评估方法的不平衡扭曲了模型性能和结果可信度。

Conclusion: 需要更现实的平衡评估方法，并进一步改进模型以更好地捕捉事件合理性变化。

Abstract: While the task of assessing the plausibility of events such as ''news is
relevant'' has been addressed by a growing body of work, less attention has
been paid to capturing changes in plausibility as triggered by event
modification. Understanding changes in plausibility is relevant for tasks such
as dialogue generation, commonsense reasoning, and hallucination detection as
it allows to correctly model, for example, ''gentle sarcasm'' as a sign of
closeness rather than unkindness among friends [9]. In this work, we tackle the
ADEPT challenge benchmark [6] consisting of 16K English sentence pairs
differing by exactly one adjectival modifier. Our modeling experiments provide
a conceptually novel method by using sentence transformers, and reveal that
both they and transformer-based models struggle with the task at hand, and
sentence transformers - despite their conceptual alignment with the task - even
under-perform in comparison to models like RoBERTa. Furthermore, an in-depth
comparison with prior work highlights the importance of a more realistic,
balanced evaluation method: imbalances distort model performance and evaluation
metrics, and weaken result trustworthiness.

Method: 提出HALC流程，通过1,512个提示和两百万次请求测试不同策略，基于专家编码（ground truth）评估性能。

Result: 找到可靠提示，单变量编码一致性高（气候α=0.76，运动α=0.78），双变量一致性稍低（气候α=0.71，运动α=0.74）。

Conclusion: HALC提供系统性提示优化方法，揭示了关键影响因素和可靠提示策略，适用于不同任务和模型。

Abstract: LLMs are seeing widespread use for task automation, including automated
coding in the social sciences. However, even though researchers have proposed
different prompting strategies, their effectiveness varies across LLMs and
tasks. Often trial and error practices are still widespread. We propose
HALC$-$a general pipeline that allows for the systematic and reliable
construction of optimal prompts for any given coding task and model, permitting
the integration of any prompting strategy deemed relevant. To investigate LLM
coding and validate our pipeline, we sent a total of 1,512 individual prompts
to our local LLMs in over two million requests. We test prompting strategies
and LLM task performance based on few expert codings (ground truth). When
compared to these expert codings, we find prompts that code reliably for single
variables (${\alpha}$climate = .76; ${\alpha}$movement = .78) and across two
variables (${\alpha}$climate = .71; ${\alpha}$movement = .74) using the LLM
Mistral NeMo. Our prompting strategies are set up in a way that aligns the LLM
to our codebook$-$we are not optimizing our codebook for LLM friendliness. Our
paper provides insights into the effectiveness of different prompting
strategies, crucial influencing factors, and the identification of reliable
prompts for each coding task and model.

Motivation: 现有工具集成方法依赖静态模式，可能损害语言能力，而人类能自适应选择工具，因此提出AutoTIR。

Method: AutoTIR通过混合奖励机制（任务正确性、结构化输出、错误工具使用惩罚）优化推理和工具集成。

Result: 在多种任务中，AutoTIR表现优于基线，工具使用行为泛化能力强。

Conclusion: 强化学习有望为LLMs构建通用、可扩展的工具集成推理能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), when enhanced through reasoning-oriented
post-training, evolve into powerful Large Reasoning Models (LRMs).
Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) further extends their capabilities by
incorporating external tools, but existing methods often rely on rigid,
predefined tool-use patterns that risk degrading core language competence.
Inspired by the human ability to adaptively select tools, we introduce AutoTIR,
a reinforcement learning framework that enables LLMs to autonomously decide
whether and which tool to invoke during the reasoning process, rather than
following static tool-use strategies. AutoTIR leverages a hybrid reward
mechanism that jointly optimizes for task-specific answer correctness,
structured output adherence, and penalization of incorrect tool usage, thereby
encouraging both precise reasoning and efficient tool integration. Extensive
evaluations across diverse knowledge-intensive, mathematical, and general
language modeling tasks demonstrate that AutoTIR achieves superior overall
performance, significantly outperforming baselines and exhibits superior
generalization in tool-use behavior. These results highlight the promise of
reinforcement learning in building truly generalizable and scalable TIR
capabilities in LLMs. The code and data are available at

TL;DR: Graph-R1通过强化学习改进GraphRAG，提升检索效率和生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统GraphRAG的高构建成本、固定检索和长上下文推理依赖问题。

Method: 提出轻量级知识超图构建，将检索建模为多轮代理-环境交互，并通过端到端奖励机制优化。

Result: 在标准RAG数据集上，Graph-R1在推理准确性、检索效率和生成质量上优于传统方法。

Conclusion: Graph-R1通过强化学习框架有效提升了GraphRAG的性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates hallucination in LLMs by
incorporating external knowledge, but relies on chunk-based retrieval that
lacks structural semantics. GraphRAG methods improve RAG by modeling knowledge
as entity-relation graphs, but still face challenges in high construction cost,
fixed one-time retrieval, and reliance on long-context reasoning and prompt
design. To address these challenges, we propose Graph-R1, an agentic GraphRAG
framework via end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL). It introduces lightweight
knowledge hypergraph construction, models retrieval as a multi-turn
agent-environment interaction, and optimizes the agent process via an
end-to-end reward mechanism. Experiments on standard RAG datasets show that
Graph-R1 outperforms traditional GraphRAG and RL-enhanced RAG methods in
reasoning accuracy, retrieval efficiency, and generation quality.

TL;DR: 研究发现，LLMs可以通过死记硬背的数据进行泛化，采用两阶段记忆-泛化框架，实验证明模型能重新解释记忆数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨死记硬背是否阻碍泛化，并探索LLMs如何从记忆数据中学习泛化。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：先通过无意义标记记忆事实关联，再通过少量有意义提示微调泛化。

Result: 8个LLMs实验显示模型能通过有意义提示重新解释记忆数据，形成结构化潜在表征。

Conclusion: 这一发现为高效知识注入和潜在恶意数据利用提供了新视角。

Abstract: Rote learning is a memorization technique based on repetition. It is commonly
believed to hinder generalization by encouraging verbatim memorization rather
than deeper understanding. This insight holds for even learning factual
knowledge that inevitably requires a certain degree of memorization. In this
work, we demonstrate that LLMs can be trained to generalize from rote memorized
data. We introduce a two-phase memorize-then-generalize framework, where the
model first rote memorizes factual subject-object associations using a
semantically meaningless token and then learns to generalize by fine-tuning on
a small set of semantically meaningful prompts. Extensive experiments over 8
LLMs show that the models can reinterpret rote memorized data through the
semantically meaningful prompts, as evidenced by the emergence of structured,
semantically aligned latent representations between the two. This surprising
finding opens the door to both effective and efficient knowledge injection and
possible risks of repurposing the memorized data for malicious usage.

TL;DR: 研究发现，优化语言模型以表现温暖和同理心会显著降低其可靠性，尤其是在用户表达脆弱时。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨语言模型在温暖性和可靠性之间的权衡，揭示当前评估方法可能忽略的系统性风险。

Method: 对五种不同规模和架构的语言模型进行实验，训练其生成更温暖的回应，并评估其在安全关键任务中的表现。

Result: 温暖模型在错误率上显著增加（+10至+30个百分点），更容易传播错误信息、阴谋论和不当医疗建议。

Conclusion: 需重新思考如何开发和监督这些重塑人际关系的AI系统。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) developers are increasingly building language
models with warm and empathetic personas that millions of people now use for
advice, therapy, and companionship. Here, we show how this creates a
significant trade-off: optimizing language models for warmth undermines their
reliability, especially when users express vulnerability. We conducted
controlled experiments on five language models of varying sizes and
architectures, training them to produce warmer, more empathetic responses, then
evaluating them on safety-critical tasks. Warm models showed substantially
higher error rates (+10 to +30 percentage points) than their original
counterparts, promoting conspiracy theories, providing incorrect factual
information, and offering problematic medical advice. They were also
significantly more likely to validate incorrect user beliefs, particularly when
user messages expressed sadness. Importantly, these effects were consistent
across different model architectures, and occurred despite preserved
performance on standard benchmarks, revealing systematic risks that current
evaluation practices may fail to detect. As human-like AI systems are deployed
at an unprecedented scale, our findings indicate a need to rethink how we
develop and oversee these systems that are reshaping human relationships and
social interaction.

Motivation: 解决LLM生成答案校准性差的问题，提升其在推理任务中的可靠性。

Result: RLSF显著改善了模型的校准性和逐步推理能力，在算术推理和选择题任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: RLSF证明了利用模型内在行为进行强化学习的有效性，为LLM后训练提供了高效的数据驱动方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce plausible but poorly-calibrated
answers, limiting their reliability on reasoning-intensive tasks. We present
Reinforcement Learning from Self-Feedback (RLSF), a post-training stage that
uses the model's own confidence as an intrinsic reward, mimicking how humans
learn in the absence of external feedback. After a frozen LLM generates several
chain-of-thought solutions, we define and compute the confidence of each final
answer span and rank the traces accordingly. These synthetic preferences are
then used to fine-tune the policy with standard preference optimization,
similar to RLHF yet requiring no human labels, gold answers, or externally
curated rewards.
  RLSF simultaneously (i) refines the model's probability estimates --
restoring well-behaved calibration -- and (ii) strengthens step-by-step
reasoning, yielding improved performance on arithmetic reasoning and
multiple-choice question answering.
  By turning a model's own uncertainty into useful self-feedback, RLSF affirms
reinforcement learning on intrinsic model behaviour as a principled and
data-efficient component of the LLM post-training pipeline and warrents further
research in intrinsic rewards for LLM post-training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究RAG在跨文化食谱适应中的局限性，尤其是其无法利用上下文多样性生成多样化结果的问题。

Method: 提出CARRIAGE框架，通过改进检索和上下文组织来增强多样性。

Result: CARRIAGE在多样性和质量上优于封闭式LLMs，达到帕累托效率。

Conclusion: CARRIAGE是首个明确追求多样性的RAG框架，有效解决了RAG在创造性任务中的局限性。

Abstract: In cross-cultural recipe adaptation, the goal is not only to ensure cultural
appropriateness and retain the original dish's essence, but also to provide
diverse options for various dietary needs and preferences. Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG) is a promising approach, combining the retrieval of real
recipes from the target cuisine for cultural adaptability with large language
models (LLMs) for relevance. However, it remains unclear whether RAG can
generate diverse adaptation results. Our analysis shows that RAG tends to
overly rely on a limited portion of the context across generations, failing to
produce diverse outputs even when provided with varied contextual inputs. This
reveals a key limitation of RAG in creative tasks with multiple valid answers:
it fails to leverage contextual diversity for generating varied responses. To
address this issue, we propose CARRIAGE, a plug-and-play RAG framework for
cross-cultural recipe adaptation that enhances diversity in both retrieval and
context organization. To our knowledge, this is the first RAG framework that
explicitly aims to generate highly diverse outputs to accommodate multiple user
preferences. Our experiments show that CARRIAGE achieves Pareto efficiency in
terms of diversity and quality of recipe adaptation compared to closed-book
LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统机器学习模型在微生物组研究中因样本量小或标签格式异构导致的泛化能力不足问题。

Method: 使用ChatGPT-4o、Claude 3.7 Sonnet、Grok-3和LLaMA 4等LLMs，在零样本和少样本设置下进行分类和预测，并与随机森林等传统模型对比。

Result: LLMs在分类和污染风险预测中均优于基线模型，且能跨站点和元数据分布泛化。

Conclusion: LLMs能有效处理稀疏、异构的生物元数据，为环境微生物学和生物监测提供了一种有前景的元数据专用方法。

Abstract: Traditional machine learning models struggle to generalize in microbiome
studies where only metadata is available, especially in small-sample settings
or across studies with heterogeneous label formats. In this work, we explore
the use of large language models (LLMs) to classify microbial samples into
ontology categories such as EMPO 3 and related biological labels, as well as to
predict pathogen contamination risk, specifically the presence of E. Coli,
using environmental metadata alone. We evaluate LLMs such as ChatGPT-4o, Claude
3.7 Sonnet, Grok-3, and LLaMA 4 in zero-shot and few-shot settings, comparing
their performance against traditional models like Random Forests across
multiple real-world datasets. Our results show that LLMs not only outperform
baselines in ontology classification, but also demonstrate strong predictive
ability for contamination risk, generalizing across sites and metadata
distributions. These findings suggest that LLMs can effectively reason over
sparse, heterogeneous biological metadata and offer a promising metadata-only
approach for environmental microbiology and biosurveillance applications.

Motivation: 解决现有RAG方法在查询和知识源控制上的不足，导致检索噪声和浅层推理的问题。

Method: 提出DeepSieve框架，利用LLM作为知识路由器，分解复杂查询并递归路由到合适的知识源，通过多阶段蒸馏过滤无关信息。

Result: 在多跳QA任务中，相比传统RAG方法，DeepSieve在推理深度、检索精度和可解释性上表现更优。

Conclusion: DeepSieve通过模块化和透明设计，显著提升了RAG框架的性能和适应性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many reasoning tasks but struggle with
knowledge-intensive queries due to their inability to dynamically access
up-to-date or domain-specific information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
has emerged as a promising solution, enabling LLMs to ground their responses in
external sources. However, existing RAG methods lack fine-grained control over
both the query and source sides, often resulting in noisy retrieval and shallow
reasoning. In this work, we introduce DeepSieve, an agentic RAG framework that
incorporates information sieving via LLM-as-a-knowledge-router. DeepSieve
decomposes complex queries into structured sub-questions and recursively routes
each to the most suitable knowledge source, filtering irrelevant information
through a multi-stage distillation process. Our design emphasizes modularity,
transparency, and adaptability, leveraging recent advances in agentic system
design. Experiments on multi-hop QA tasks across heterogeneous sources
demonstrate improved reasoning depth, retrieval precision, and interpretability
over conventional RAG approaches.

Conclusion: 该数据集和工具旨在加速机器学习驱动的人体运动分析研究。

Abstract: Wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs) offer a cost-effective and
scalable means to assess human movement quality in clinical and everyday
settings. However, the development of robust sensor-based classification models
for physiotherapeutic exercises and gait analysis requires large, diverse
datasets, which are costly and time-consuming to collect. Here, we present a
multimodal dataset of physiotherapeutic exercises - including correct and
clinically relevant variants - and gait-related exercises - including both
normal and impaired gait patterns - recorded from 19 participants using
synchronized IMUs and marker-based motion capture (MoCap). The dataset includes
raw data from nine IMUs and thirty-five optical markers capturing full-body
kinematics. Each IMU is additionally equipped with four optical markers,
enabling precise comparison between IMU-derived orientation estimates and
reference values from the MoCap system. To support further analysis, we also
provide processed IMU orientations aligned with common segment coordinate
systems, subject-specific OpenSim models, inverse kinematics results, and tools
for visualizing IMU orientations in the musculoskeletal context. Detailed
annotations of movement execution quality and time-stamped segmentations
support diverse analysis goals. This dataset supports the development and
benchmarking of machine learning models for tasks such as automatic exercise
evaluation, gait analysis, temporal activity segmentation, and biomechanical
parameter estimation. To facilitate reproducibility, we provide code for
postprocessing, sensor-to-segment alignment, inverse kinematics computation,
and technical validation. This resource is intended to accelerate research in
machine learning-driven human movement analysis.

Abstract: Pedestrian intention prediction is essential for autonomous driving in
complex urban environments. Conventional approaches depend on supervised
learning over frame sequences and require extensive retraining to adapt to new
scenarios. Here, we introduce BF-PIP (Beyond Frames Pedestrian Intention
Prediction), a zero-shot approach built upon Gemini 2.5 Pro. It infers crossing
intentions directly from short, continuous video clips enriched with structured
JAAD metadata. In contrast to GPT-4V based methods that operate on discrete
frames, BF-PIP processes uninterrupted temporal clips. It also incorporates
bounding-box annotations and ego-vehicle speed via specialized multimodal
prompts. Without any additional training, BF-PIP achieves 73% prediction
accuracy, outperforming a GPT-4V baseline by 18 %. These findings illustrate
that combining temporal video inputs with contextual cues enhances
spatiotemporal perception and improves intent inference under ambiguous
conditions. This approach paves the way for agile, retraining-free perception
module in intelligent transportation system.

Abstract: We propose a universal video-level modality-awareness tracking model with
online dense temporal token learning (called {\modaltracker}). It is designed
to support various tracking tasks, including RGB, RGB+Thermal, RGB+Depth, and
RGB+Event, utilizing the same model architecture and parameters. Specifically,
our model is designed with three core goals: \textbf{Video-level Sampling}. We
expand the model's inputs to a video sequence level, aiming to see a richer
video context from an near-global perspective. \textbf{Video-level
Association}. Furthermore, we introduce two simple yet effective online dense
temporal token association mechanisms to propagate the appearance and motion
trajectory information of target via a video stream manner. \textbf{Modality
Scalable}. We propose two novel gated perceivers that adaptively learn
cross-modal representations via a gated attention mechanism, and subsequently
compress them into the same set of model parameters via a one-shot training
manner for multi-task inference. This new solution brings the following
benefits: (i) The purified token sequences can serve as temporal prompts for
the inference in the next video frames, whereby previous information is
leveraged to guide future inference. (ii) Unlike multi-modal trackers that
require independent training, our one-shot training scheme not only alleviates
the training burden, but also improves model representation. Extensive
experiments on visible and multi-modal benchmarks show that our {\modaltracker}
achieves a new \textit{SOTA} performance. The code will be available at

Abstract: Charts are a fundamental visualization format widely used in data analysis
across research and industry. While enabling users to edit charts based on
high-level intentions is of great practical value, existing methods primarily
rely on natural language instructions, which are often too ambiguous to support
fine-grained editing. In this work, we introduce a novel paradigm for
multimodal chart editing, where user intent is expressed through a combination
of natural language and visual indicators that explicitly highlight the
elements to be modified. To support this paradigm, we present
Chart$\text{M}^3$, a new benchmark for Multimodal chart editing with
Multi-level complexity and Multi-perspective evaluation. Chart$\text{M}^3$
contains 1,000 samples spanning four levels of editing difficulty. Each sample
includes triplets in the form of (chart, code, multimodal instructions). To
comprehensively evaluate chart editing models, Chart$\text{M}^3$ provides
metrics that assess both visual appearance and code correctness. Our benchmark
reveals significant limitations in current multimodal large language models
(MLLMs), including GPT-4o, particularly in their ability to interpret and act
on visual indicators. To address this, we construct Chart$\text{M}^3$-Train, a
large-scale training set with 24,000 multimodal chart editing samples.
Fine-tuning MLLMs on this dataset leads to substantial improvements,
demonstrating the importance of multimodal supervision in building practical
chart editing systems. Our datasets, codes, and evaluation tools are available

Abstract: This paper presents the development of a generative adversarial network (GAN)
for synthesizing dental panoramic radiographs. Although exploratory in nature,
the study aims to address the scarcity of data in dental research and
education. We trained a deep convolutional GAN (DCGAN) using a Wasserstein loss
with gradient penalty (WGANGP) on a dataset of 2322 radiographs of varying
quality. The focus was on the dentoalveolar regions, other anatomical
structures were cropped out. Extensive preprocessing and data cleaning were
performed to standardize the inputs while preserving anatomical variability. We
explored four candidate models by varying critic iterations, feature depth, and
the use of denoising prior to training. A clinical expert evaluated the
generated radiographs based on anatomical visibility and realism, using a
5-point scale (1 very poor 5 excellent). Most images showed moderate anatomical
depiction, although some were degraded by artifacts. A trade-off was observed
the model trained on non-denoised data yielded finer details especially in
structures like the mandibular canal and trabecular bone, while a model trained
on denoised data offered superior overall image clarity and sharpness. These
findings provide a foundation for future work on GAN-based methods in dental
imaging.

Conclusion: VAGU和GtS为视频异常检测提供了更全面的解决方案，JeAUG改进了传统评估方法。

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to identify anomalous events in videos and
accurately determine their time intervals. Current VAD methods mainly fall into
two categories: traditional DNN-based approaches that focus on temporal
localization, and LLM-based approaches that emphasize semantic understanding.
Both anomaly understanding and grounding are essential for comprehensive video
anomaly detection and can complement each other. However, no existing model or
dataset supports both tasks simultaneously. To address this, we introduce VAGU
(Video Anomaly Grounding and Understanding), the first benchmark to integrate
both tasks. Each VAGU instance includes annotations for anomaly category,
semantic explanation, precise temporal grounding and Video QA. We also provide
multiple-choice Video QA for objective evaluation. Based on this dataset, we
propose Glance then Scrutinize (GtS), a training-free framework guided by
textual prompts. The framework first enables coarse localization of
high-probability anomalous regions, followed by detailed anomaly interpretation
and temporal boundary refinement. Additionally, we propose the JeAUG metric,
which jointly evaluates semantic interpretability and temporal precision,
overcoming the limitations of traditional metrics. Extensive experiments verify
the effectiveness of our benchmark, framework, and evaluation metric.

Conclusion: 该框架为深度神经网络在多模态任务中的解释提供了一种新方法，增强了模型的可解释性。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have made tremendous progress in multimodal tasks
such as image captioning. However, explaining/interpreting how these models
integrate visual information, language information and knowledge representation
to generate meaningful captions remains a challenging problem. Standard metrics
to measure performance typically rely on comparing generated captions with
human-written ones that may not provide a user with a deep insights into this
integration. In this work, we develop a novel explanation framework that is
easily interpretable based on Hybrid Markov Logic Networks (HMLNs) - a language
that can combine symbolic rules with real-valued functions - where we
hypothesize how relevant examples from the training data could have influenced
the generation of the observed caption. To do this, we learn a HMLN
distribution over the training instances and infer the shift in distributions
over these instances when we condition on the generated sample which allows us
to quantify which examples may have been a source of richer information to
generate the observed caption. Our experiments on captions generated for
several state-of-the-art captioning models using Amazon Mechanical Turk
illustrate the interpretability of our explanations, and allow us to compare
these models along the dimension of explainability.

Conclusion: MAGE通过创新对齐机制显著提升了多模态模型的性能。

Abstract: In the latest advancements in multimodal learning, effectively addressing the
spatial and semantic losses of visual data after encoding remains a critical
challenge. This is because the performance of large multimodal models is
positively correlated with the coupling between visual encoders and large
language models. Existing approaches often face issues such as vector gaps or
semantic disparities, resulting in information loss during the propagation
process. To address these issues, we propose MAGE (Multimodal Alignment and
Generation Enhancement), a novel framework that bridges the semantic spaces of
vision and text through an innovative alignment mechanism. By introducing the
Intelligent Alignment Network (IAN), MAGE achieves dimensional and semantic
alignment. To reduce the gap between synonymous heterogeneous data, we employ a
training strategy that combines cross-entropy and mean squared error,
significantly enhancing the alignment effect. Moreover, to enhance MAGE's
"Any-to-Any" capability, we developed a fine-tuning dataset for multimodal
tool-calling instructions to expand the model's output capability boundaries.
Finally, our proposed multimodal large model architecture, MAGE, achieved
significantly better performance compared to similar works across various
evaluation benchmarks, including MME, MMBench, and SEED. Complete code and
appendix are available at: https://github.com/GTCOM-NLP/MAGE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 半监督学习在图像分类中已有广泛应用，但在时空动作定位领域的研究较少，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 设计了双引导网络，结合帧级分类和边界框预测，以确保动作类别在帧和边界框之间的一致性。

Result: 在UCF101-24、J-HMDB-21和AVA数据集上的评估表明，该方法在有限标注数据下显著优于基线。

Conclusion: 提出的框架在时空动作定位任务中表现出色，为半监督学习在该领域的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) has shown tremendous potential to improve the
predictive performance of deep learning models when annotations are hard to
obtain. However, the application of SSL has so far been mainly studied in the
context of image classification. In this work, we present a semi-supervised
approach for spatial-temporal action localization. We introduce a dual guidance
network to select better pseudo-bounding boxes. It combines a frame-level
classification with a bounding-box prediction to enforce action class
consistency across frames and boxes. Our evaluation across well-known
spatial-temporal action localization datasets, namely UCF101-24 , J-HMDB-21 and
AVA shows that the proposed module considerably enhances the model's
performance in limited labeled data settings. Our framework achieves superior
results compared to extended image-based semi-supervised baselines.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 航空野生动物追踪面临高成本、高风险和技术挑战，尤其是小目标检测在有限计算资源下的效率问题。

Method: 采用数据增强（分块）方法，对比三种不同架构的目标检测器在不同分块参数下的性能。

Result: 所有模型在至少一种分块配置下达到93%以上的mAP@IoU=0.5，统计分析表明简单模型在有限资源下表现优异。

Conclusion: 研究支持在无人机部署中使用简单高效的模型，数据集和模型已开源。

Abstract: Aerial wildlife tracking is critical for conservation efforts and relies on
detecting small objects on the ground below the aircraft. It presents technical
challenges: crewed aircraft are expensive, risky and disruptive; autonomous
drones have limited computational capacity for onboard AI systems. Since the
objects of interest may appear only a few pixels wide, small object detection
is an inherently challenging computer vision subfield compounded by
computational efficiency needs. This paper applies a patching augmentation to
datasets to study model performance under various settings. A comparative study
of three common yet architecturally diverse object detectors is conducted using
the data, varying the patching method's hyperparameters against detection
accuracy. Each model achieved at least 93\% mAP@IoU=0.5 on at least one
patching configuration. Statistical analyses provide an in-depth commentary on
the effects of various factors. Analysis also shows that faster, simpler models
are about as effective as models that require more computational power for this
task and perform well given limited patch scales, encouraging UAV deployment.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于潜在扩散模型（LDM）的新方法，用于从单视角图像生成高质量的HDR环境贴图，解决了ERP格式中的边界伪影问题，并提出了全景适应的扩散变换器架构（PanoDiT）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决ERP格式在环境贴图中产生的极点和边界伪影问题，提升单视角图像生成环境贴图的质量和准确性。

Method: 采用潜在扩散模型（LDM），提出ERP卷积填充以消除边界伪影，并设计全景适应的扩散变换器架构（PanoDiT）以减少ERP失真。

Result: 模型在标准基准测试中表现出色，生成的环境贴图在图像质量和光照准确性上与现有最优方法竞争。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了ERP格式的伪影问题，并通过PanoDiT提升了环境贴图的质量，但图像质量和合理性有所牺牲。

Abstract: We advance the field of HDR environment map estimation from a single-view
image by establishing a novel approach leveraging the Latent Diffusion Model
(LDM) to produce high-quality environment maps that can plausibly light
mirror-reflective surfaces. A common issue when using the ERP representation,
the format used by the vast majority of approaches, is distortions at the poles
and a seam at the sides of the environment map. We remove the border seam
artefact by proposing an ERP convolutional padding in the latent autoencoder.
Additionally, we investigate whether adapting the diffusion network
architecture to the ERP format can improve the quality and accuracy of the
estimated environment map by proposing a panoramically-adapted Diffusion
Transformer architecture. Our proposed PanoDiT network reduces ERP distortions
and artefacts, but at the cost of image quality and plausibility. We evaluate
with standard benchmarks to demonstrate that our models estimate high-quality
environment maps that perform competitively with state-of-the-art approaches in
both image quality and lighting accuracy.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了六种基于CLIP的模型在胸部X光分类任务中的公平性和鲁棒性，发现不同年龄组之间存在性能差距，但对其他属性表现较公平。模型对无胸引管的图像表现较差，表明存在虚假相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受CLIP模型在自然图像-文本领域表现优异的启发，研究探索其在医学任务（如放射学）中的应用，尤其是公平性和鲁棒性方面的表现。

Method: 使用三个公开数据集（MIMIC-CXR、NIH-CXR14和NEATX）评估六种CLIP模型，分析其在六种条件和患者亚组（年龄、性别、种族）中的公平性，并评估对虚假相关性的鲁棒性。

Result: 不同年龄组之间存在性能差距，但对性别和种族表现较公平。模型对无胸引管的图像表现较差，表明依赖虚假相关性。嵌入分析显示敏感属性可分类，但PCA未显示明显模式。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了CLIP模型在医学任务中的公平性和鲁棒性局限，强调了进一步优化和评估的必要性。

Abstract: Motivated by the strong performance of CLIP-based models in natural
image-text domains, recent efforts have adapted these architectures to medical
tasks, particularly in radiology, where large paired datasets of images and
reports, such as chest X-rays, are available. While these models have shown
encouraging results in terms of accuracy and discriminative performance, their
fairness and robustness in the different clinical tasks remain largely
underexplored. In this study, we extensively evaluate six widely used
CLIP-based models on chest X-ray classification using three publicly available
datasets: MIMIC-CXR, NIH-CXR14, and NEATX. We assess the models fairness across
six conditions and patient subgroups based on age, sex, and race. Additionally,
we assess the robustness to shortcut learning by evaluating performance on
pneumothorax cases with and without chest drains. Our results indicate
performance gaps between patients of different ages, but more equitable results
for the other attributes. Moreover, all models exhibit lower performance on
images without chest drains, suggesting reliance on spurious correlations. We
further complement the performance analysis with a study of the embeddings
generated by the models. While the sensitive attributes could be classified
from the embeddings, we do not see such patterns using PCA, showing the
limitations of these visualisation techniques when assessing models. Our code

Result: 在视觉质量和稳定性上优于现有方法，支持标准2D设备实现3D会议。

Conclusion: 该方法为3D视频会议提供了高可访问性、真实性和沉浸感的解决方案。

Abstract: Virtual 3D meetings offer the potential to enhance copresence, increase
engagement and thus improve effectiveness of remote meetings compared to
standard 2D video calls. However, representing people in 3D meetings remains a
challenge; existing solutions achieve high quality by using complex hardware,
making use of fixed appearance via enrolment, or by inverting a pre-trained
generative model. These approaches lead to constraints that are unwelcome and
ill-fitting for videoconferencing applications. We present the first method to
predict 3D Gaussian reconstructions in real time from a single 2D webcam feed,
where the 3D representation is not only live and realistic, but also authentic
to the input video. By conditioning the 3D representation on each video frame
independently, our reconstruction faithfully recreates the input video from the
captured viewpoint (a property we call authenticity), while generalizing
realistically to novel viewpoints. Additionally, we introduce a stability loss
to obtain reconstructions that are temporally stable on video sequences. We
show that our method delivers state-of-the-art accuracy in visual quality and
stability metrics compared to existing methods, and demonstrate our approach in
live one-to-one 3D meetings using only a standard 2D camera and display. This
demonstrates that our approach can allow anyone to communicate volumetrically,
via a method for 3D videoconferencing that is not only highly accessible, but
also realistic and authentic.

Result: 在2D和3D数据集上的实验表明，GLCP在分割精度和连续性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GLCP通过全局和局部特征的联合学习，有效解决了管状结构分割中的断裂问题，具有较高的实用价值。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of tubular structures, such as vascular networks, plays
a critical role in various medical domains. A remaining significant challenge
in this task is structural fragmentation, which can adversely impact downstream
applications. Existing methods primarily focus on designing various loss
functions to constrain global topological structures. However, they often
overlook local discontinuity regions, leading to suboptimal segmentation
results. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel Global-to-Local
Connectivity Preservation (GLCP) framework that can simultaneously perceive
global and local structural characteristics of tubular networks. Specifically,
we propose an Interactive Multi-head Segmentation (IMS) module to jointly learn
global segmentation, skeleton maps, and local discontinuity maps, respectively.
This enables our model to explicitly target local discontinuity regions while
maintaining global topological integrity. In addition, we design a lightweight
Dual-Attention-based Refinement (DAR) module to further improve segmentation
quality by refining the resulting segmentation maps. Extensive experiments on
both 2D and 3D datasets demonstrate that our GLCP achieves superior accuracy
and continuity in tubular structure segmentation compared to several
state-of-the-art approaches. The source codes will be available at

Result: VLMs的性能因修饰语的添加而下降。

Conclusion: 该方法有助于理解VLMs的局限性。

Abstract: We can think of Visual Question Answering as a (multimodal) conversation
between a human and an AI system. Here, we explore the sensitivity of Vision
Language Models (VLMs) through the lens of cooperative principles of
conversation proposed by Grice. Specifically, even when Grice's maxims of
conversation are flouted, humans typically do not have much difficulty in
understanding the conversation even though it requires more cognitive effort.
Here, we study if VLMs are capable of handling violations to Grice's maxims in
a manner that is similar to humans. Specifically, we add modifiers to
human-crafted questions and analyze the response of VLMs to these modifiers. We
use three state-of-the-art VLMs in our study, namely, GPT-4o, Claude-3.5-Sonnet
and Gemini-1.5-Flash on questions from the VQA v2.0 dataset. Our initial
results seem to indicate that the performance of VLMs consistently diminish
with the addition of modifiers which indicates our approach as a promising
direction to understand the limitations of VLMs.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a crucial medical imaging modality.
However, long acquisition times remain a significant challenge, leading to
increased costs, and reduced patient comfort. Recent studies have shown the
potential of using deep learning models that incorporate information from prior
subject-specific MRI scans to improve reconstruction quality of present scans.
Integrating this prior information requires registration of the previous scan
to the current image reconstruction, which can be time-consuming. We propose a
novel deep-learning-based MRI reconstruction framework which consists of an
initial reconstruction network, a deep registration model, and a
transformer-based enhancement network. We validated our method on a
longitudinal dataset of T1-weighted MRI scans with 2,808 images from 18
subjects at four acceleration factors (R5, R10, R15, R20). Quantitative metrics
confirmed our approach's superiority over existing methods (p < 0.05, Wilcoxon
signed-rank test). Furthermore, we analyzed the impact of our MRI
reconstruction method on the downstream task of brain segmentation and observed
improved accuracy and volumetric agreement with reference segmentations. Our
approach also achieved a substantial reduction in total reconstruction time
compared to methods that use traditional registration algorithms, making it
more suitable for real-time clinical applications. The code associated with
this work is publicly available at

Abstract: Adapting large Video-Language Models (VLMs) for action detection using only a
few examples poses challenges like overfitting and the granularity mismatch
between scene-level pre-training and required person-centric understanding. We
propose an efficient adaptation strategy combining parameter-efficient tuning
(LoRA) with a novel learnable internal feature augmentation. Applied within the
frozen VLM backbone using FiLM, these augmentations generate diverse feature
variations directly relevant to the task. Additionally, we introduce a
group-weighted loss function that dynamically modulates the training
contribution of each augmented sample based on its prediction divergence
relative to the group average. This promotes robust learning by prioritizing
informative yet reasonable augmentations. We demonstrate our method's
effectiveness on complex multi-label, multi-person action detection datasets
(AVA, MOMA), achieving strong mAP performance and showcasing significant data
efficiency for adapting VLMs from limited examples.

Conclusion: CoP通过多任务协作显著提升BEV检测性能。

Abstract: Vision-based bird's-eye-view (BEV) 3D object detection has advanced
significantly in autonomous driving by offering cost-effectiveness and rich
contextual information. However, existing methods often construct BEV
representations by collapsing extracted object features, neglecting intrinsic
environmental contexts, such as roads and pavements. This hinders detectors
from comprehensively perceiving the characteristics of the physical world. To
alleviate this, we introduce a multi-task learning framework, Collaborative
Perceiver (CoP), that leverages spatial occupancy as auxiliary information to
mine consistent structural and conceptual similarities shared between 3D object
detection and occupancy prediction tasks, bridging gaps in spatial
representations and feature refinement. To this end, we first propose a
pipeline to generate dense occupancy ground truths incorporating local density
information (LDO) for reconstructing detailed environmental information. Next,
we employ a voxel-height-guided sampling (VHS) strategy to distill fine-grained
local features according to distinct object properties. Furthermore, we develop
a global-local collaborative feature fusion (CFF) module that seamlessly
integrates complementary knowledge between both tasks, thus composing more
robust BEV representations. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes benchmark
demonstrate that CoP outperforms existing vision-based frameworks, achieving
49.5\% mAP and 59.2\% NDS on the test set. Code and supplementary materials are

classification using deep learning has emerged as a promising tool for
biodiversity monitoring and conservation. This paper presents a comparative
study of deep learning models for automatically classifying African wildlife

public dataset of four species: buffalo, elephant, rhinoceros, and zebra; we
evaluate the performance of DenseNet-201, ResNet-152, EfficientNet-B4, and
Vision Transformer ViT-H/14. DenseNet-201 achieved the best performance among

raising deployment concerns. Our experiments highlight the trade-offs between
accuracy, resource requirements, and deployability. The best-performing CNN

Conclusion: PDAF通过概率扩散建模和潜在域先验，显著提升了语义分割在未见目标域中的表现。

Abstract: Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS) is a critical yet challenging
task, as domain shifts in unseen environments can severely compromise model
performance. While recent studies enhance feature alignment by projecting
features into the source domain, they often neglect intrinsic latent domain
priors, leading to suboptimal results. In this paper, we introduce PDAF, a
Probabilistic Diffusion Alignment Framework that enhances the generalization of
existing segmentation networks through probabilistic diffusion modeling. PDAF
introduces a Latent Domain Prior (LDP) to capture domain shifts and uses this
prior as a conditioning factor to align both source and unseen target domains.
To achieve this, PDAF integrates into a pre-trained segmentation model and
utilizes paired source and pseudo-target images to simulate latent domain
shifts, enabling LDP modeling. The framework comprises three modules: the
Latent Prior Extractor (LPE) predicts the LDP by supervising domain shifts; the
Domain Compensation Module (DCM) adjusts feature representations to mitigate
domain shifts; and the Diffusion Prior Estimator (DPE) leverages a diffusion
process to estimate the LDP without requiring paired samples. This design
enables PDAF to iteratively model domain shifts, progressively refining feature
representations to enhance generalization under complex target conditions.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of PDAF across diverse and
challenging urban scenes.

Abstract: Generating immersive 360{\deg} indoor panoramas from 2D top-down views has
applications in virtual reality, interior design, real estate, and robotics.
This task is challenging due to the lack of explicit 3D structure and the need
for geometric consistency and photorealism. We propose Top2Pano, an end-to-end
model for synthesizing realistic indoor panoramas from top-down views. Our
method estimates volumetric occupancy to infer 3D structures, then uses
volumetric rendering to generate coarse color and depth panoramas. These guide
a diffusion-based refinement stage using ControlNet, enhancing realism and
structural fidelity. Evaluations on two datasets show Top2Pano outperforms
baselines, effectively reconstructing geometry, occlusions, and spatial
arrangements. It also generalizes well, producing high-quality panoramas from
schematic floorplans. Our results highlight Top2Pano's potential in bridging
top-down views with immersive indoor synthesis.

TL;DR: LLaVA-Reward是一种高效的奖励模型，用于多视角自动评估文本到图像生成，利用预训练的多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的隐藏状态，并通过Skip-connection Cross Attention模块增强视觉与文本的交互。

Motivation: 现有MLLM方法需要指令跟随数据进行监督微调，且通过分析文本响应评估生成质量，耗时且难以训练。LLaVA-Reward旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 直接利用MLLMs的隐藏状态，引入SkipCA模块增强视觉与文本的交互，并支持多种偏好数据（配对和非配对）进行高效微调。

Abstract: We introduce LLaVA-Reward, an efficient reward model designed to
automatically evaluate text-to-image (T2I) generations across multiple
perspectives, leveraging pretrained multimodal large language models (MLLMs).
Existing MLLM-based approaches require instruction-following data for
supervised fine-tuning and evaluate generation quality on analyzing text
response, which is time-consuming and difficult to train. To address this
problem, we propose LLaVA-Reward, which directly utilizes the hidden states of
MLLMs given text-image pairs. To enhance the bidirectional interaction between
visual and textual representations in decoder-only MLLMs, we further propose
adding a Skip-connection Cross Attention (SkipCA) module. This design enhances
text-image correlation reasoning by connecting early-layer visual features with
later-layer hidden representations.In addition, LLaVA-Reward supports different
types of preference data for efficient fine-tuning, including paired preference
data and unpaired data. We train LLaVA-Reward on four evaluation perspectives:

Motivation: 现有方法主要针对推理阶段，对训练阶段的效率提升有限。ReGATE旨在通过选择性处理关键令牌来加速训练。

Method: 采用教师-学生框架，教师模型计算参考损失，结合学生模型的难度评分，选择性处理令牌。

Conclusion: ReGATE在减少计算开销的同时，甚至在某些多模态基准上超越基线表现。

Abstract: The computational cost of training multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
rapidly increases with the number of tokens involved. Existing efficiency
methods primarily target inference and rely on token reduction or merging,
offering limited benefit during training. In this paper, we propose ReGATE
(Reference$-$Guided Adaptive Token Elision), an adaptive token pruning method
for accelerating MLLM training. Specifically, ReGATE adopts a teacher-student
framework in which the MLLM being trained serves as the student, and a frozen
reference large language model (LLM) acts as the teacher. The teacher computes
per-token reference losses, which are combined with an exponential moving
average (EMA) of the student's own difficulty scores. This adaptive
difficulty-based scoring enables the selective processing of crucial tokens
while bypassing less informative ones in the forward pass, significantly
reducing computational overhead. Experiments demonstrate that ReGATE, when
applied to VideoLLaMA2, matches the peak accuracy of standard training on
MVBench up to 2$\times$ faster, using only 35% of the tokens. With additional
training, it even surpasses the baseline on several multimodal benchmarks, all
while reducing the total token count by over 41%. Code and models will be
released soon.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统地图构建模型提供确定性点估计，无法捕捉真实环境中的不确定性和模糊性（如遮挡和缺失车道标记）。

Method: 提出MapDiffusion，基于扩散范式，从BEV潜在网格条件化生成多个可能的向量化地图样本。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，MapDiffusion单样本性能超越基线5%，多样本聚合进一步提升性能，不确定性估计在遮挡区域显著更高。

Conclusion: MapDiffusion通过建模完整地图分布，增强了在线向量化高清地图构建的鲁棒性和可靠性，支持自动驾驶在复杂环境中的不确定性感知决策。

Abstract: Autonomous driving requires an understanding of the static environment from
sensor data. Learned Bird's-Eye View (BEV) encoders are commonly used to fuse
multiple inputs, and a vector decoder predicts a vectorized map representation
from the latent BEV grid. However, traditional map construction models provide
deterministic point estimates, failing to capture uncertainty and the inherent
ambiguities of real-world environments, such as occlusions and missing lane
markings. We propose MapDiffusion, a novel generative approach that leverages
the diffusion paradigm to learn the full distribution of possible vectorized
maps. Instead of predicting a single deterministic output from learned queries,
MapDiffusion iteratively refines randomly initialized queries, conditioned on a
BEV latent grid, to generate multiple plausible map samples. This allows
aggregating samples to improve prediction accuracy and deriving uncertainty
estimates that directly correlate with scene ambiguity. Extensive experiments
on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that MapDiffusion achieves state-of-the-art
performance in online map construction, surpassing the baseline by 5% in
single-sample performance. We further show that aggregating multiple samples
consistently improves performance along the ROC curve, validating the benefit
of distribution modeling. Additionally, our uncertainty estimates are
significantly higher in occluded areas, reinforcing their value in identifying
regions with ambiguous sensor input. By modeling the full map distribution,
MapDiffusion enhances the robustness and reliability of online vectorized HD
map construction, enabling uncertainty-aware decision-making for autonomous
vehicles in complex environments.

Conclusion: DuCiSC通过跨图像语义一致性和自感知策略，显著提升了半监督医学图像分割的性能。

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning has proven highly effective in tackling the
challenge of limited labeled training data in medical image segmentation. In
general, current approaches, which rely on intra-image pixel-wise consistency
training via pseudo-labeling, overlook the consistency at more comprehensive
semantic levels (e.g., object region) and suffer from severe discrepancy of
extracted features resulting from an imbalanced number of labeled and unlabeled
data. To overcome these limitations, we present a new \underline{Du}al
\underline{C}ross-\underline{i}mage \underline{S}emantic
\underline{C}onsistency (DuCiSC) learning framework, for semi-supervised
medical image segmentation. Concretely, beyond enforcing pixel-wise semantic
consistency, DuCiSC proposes dual paradigms to encourage region-level semantic
consistency across: 1) labeled and unlabeled images; and 2) labeled and fused
images, by explicitly aligning their prototypes. Relying on the dual paradigms,
DuCiSC can effectively establish consistent cross-image semantics via prototype
representations, thereby addressing the feature discrepancy issue. Moreover, we
devise a novel self-aware confidence estimation strategy to accurately select
reliable pseudo labels, allowing for exploiting the training dynamics of
unlabeled data. Our DuCiSC method is extensively validated on four datasets,
including two popular binary benchmarks in segmenting the left atrium and
pancreas, a multi-class Automatic Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge dataset, and a
challenging scenario of segmenting the inferior alveolar nerve that features
complicated anatomical structures, showing superior segmentation results over
previous state-of-the-art approaches. Our code is publicly available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种递归视觉想象（RVI）和自适应语言对齐（ALG）技术，用于提升视觉语言导航（VLN）任务中代理的导航能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VLN代理在场景表示和视觉语言对齐方面存在问题，导致导航行为偏离语言指令。

Method: 通过递归总结视觉感知并建模历史轨迹为紧凑神经网格，结合RVI和ALG技术优化导航策略。

Result: 在VLN-CE和ObjectNav任务中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RVI和ALG技术显著提升了VLN任务的性能。

Abstract: Vision Language Navigation (VLN) typically requires agents to navigate to
specified objects or remote regions in unknown scenes by obeying linguistic
commands. Such tasks require organizing historical visual observations for
linguistic grounding, which is critical for long-sequence navigational
decisions. However, current agents suffer from overly detailed scene
representation and ambiguous vision-language alignment, which weaken their
comprehension of navigation-friendly high-level scene priors and easily lead to
behaviors that violate linguistic commands. To tackle these issues, we propose
a navigation policy by recursively summarizing along-the-way visual
perceptions, which are adaptively aligned with commands to enhance linguistic
grounding. In particular, by structurally modeling historical trajectories as
compact neural grids, several Recursive Visual Imagination (RVI) techniques are
proposed to motivate agents to focus on the regularity of visual transitions
and semantic scene layouts, instead of dealing with misleading geometric
details. Then, an Adaptive Linguistic Grounding (ALG) technique is proposed to
align the learned situational memories with different linguistic components
purposefully. Such fine-grained semantic matching facilitates the accurate
anticipation of navigation actions and progress. Our navigation policy
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the challenging VLN-CE and
ObjectNav tasks, showing the superiority of our RVI and ALG techniques for VLN.

Conclusion: 自监督数据集蒸馏方法能高效压缩数据并保持关键特征，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Although larger datasets are crucial for training large deep models, the
rapid growth of dataset size has brought a significant challenge in terms of
considerable training costs, which even results in prohibitive computational
expenses. Dataset Distillation becomes a popular technique recently to reduce
the dataset size via learning a highly compact set of representative exemplars,
where the model trained with these exemplars ideally should have comparable
performance with respect to the one trained with the full dataset. While most
of existing works upon dataset distillation focus on supervised datasets, we
instead aim to distill images and their self-supervisedly trained
representations into a distilled set. This procedure, named as Self-Supervised
Dataset Distillation, effectively extracts rich information from real datasets,
yielding the distilled sets with enhanced cross-architecture generalizability.
Particularly, in order to preserve the key characteristics of original dataset
more faithfully and compactly, several novel techniques are proposed: 1) we
introduce an innovative parameterization upon images and representations via
distinct low-dimensional bases, where the base selection for parameterization
is experimentally shown to play a crucial role; 2) we tackle the instability
induced by the randomness of data augmentation -- a key component in
self-supervised learning but being underestimated in the prior work of
self-supervised dataset distillation -- by utilizing predetermined
augmentations; 3) we further leverage a lightweight network to model the
connections among the representations of augmented views from the same image,
leading to more compact pairs of distillation. Extensive experiments conducted
on various datasets validate the superiority of our approach in terms of
distillation efficiency, cross-architecture generalization, and transfer
learning performance.

Motivation: 解决复杂低光场景中光场角度建模不可靠的问题，提升目标跟踪性能。

Method: 使用光场极平面结构图像（ESI）表示几何结构，并设计ATINet网络学习角度感知表示。

Result: ATINet在单目标跟踪中表现最优，并扩展至多目标跟踪有效。

Conclusion: ESI和ATINet显著提升了光场角度-时间建模的质量和性能。

Abstract: High-quality 4D light field representation with efficient angular feature
modeling is crucial for scene perception, as it can provide discriminative
spatial-angular cues to identify moving targets. However, recent developments
still struggle to deliver reliable angular modeling in the temporal domain,
particularly in complex low-light scenes. In this paper, we propose a novel
light field epipolar-plane structure image (ESI) representation that explicitly
defines the geometric structure within the light field. By capitalizing on the
abrupt changes in the angles of light rays within the epipolar plane, this
representation can enhance visual expression in low-light scenes and reduce
redundancy in high-dimensional light fields. We further propose an
angular-temporal interaction network (ATINet) for light field object tracking
that learns angular-aware representations from the geometric structural cues
and angular-temporal interaction cues of light fields. Furthermore, ATINet can
also be optimized in a self-supervised manner to enhance the geometric feature
interaction across the temporal domain. Finally, we introduce a large-scale
light field low-light dataset for object tracking. Extensive experimentation
demonstrates that ATINet achieves state-of-the-art performance in single object
tracking. Furthermore, we extend the proposed method to multiple object
tracking, which also shows the effectiveness of high-quality light field
angular-temporal modeling.

Motivation: 解决开放集3D物体检索中因训练数据不足导致的泛化能力差问题。

Method: 利用CLIP和MLLM协同学习泛化3D表示，并引入AB-LoRA防止过拟合。

Result: 在四个开放集3DOR数据集上平均提升10.01% mAP。

Conclusion: DAC框架在开放集3D物体检索中表现出卓越的泛化能力。

Abstract: Open-set 3D object retrieval (3DOR) is an emerging task aiming to retrieve 3D
objects of unseen categories beyond the training set. Existing methods
typically utilize all modalities (i.e., voxels, point clouds, multi-view
images) and train specific backbones before fusion. However, they still
struggle to produce generalized representations due to insufficient 3D training
data. Being contrastively pre-trained on web-scale image-text pairs, CLIP
inherently produces generalized representations for a wide range of downstream
tasks. Building upon it, we present a simple yet effective framework named
Describe, Adapt and Combine (DAC) by taking only multi-view images for open-set
3DOR. DAC innovatively synergizes a CLIP model with a multi-modal large
language model (MLLM) to learn generalized 3D representations, where the MLLM
is used for dual purposes. First, it describes the seen category information to
align with CLIP's training objective for adaptation during training. Second, it
provides external hints about unknown objects complementary to visual cues
during inference. To improve the synergy, we introduce an Additive-Bias
Low-Rank adaptation (AB-LoRA), which alleviates overfitting and further
enhances the generalization to unseen categories. With only multi-view images,
DAC significantly surpasses prior arts by an average of +10.01\% mAP on four
open-set 3DOR datasets. Moreover, its generalization is also validated on
image-based and cross-dataset setups. Code is available at

Conclusion: 该方法在减少标注需求的同时，显著提升了模型性能，为高效主动学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Active Learning (AL) has emerged as a powerful approach for minimizing
labeling costs by selectively sampling the most informative data for neural
network model development. Effective AL for large-scale vision-language models
necessitates addressing challenges in uncertainty estimation and efficient
sampling given the vast number of parameters involved. In this work, we
introduce a novel parameter-efficient learning methodology that incorporates
uncertainty calibration loss within the AL framework. We propose a
differentiable loss function that promotes uncertainty calibration for
effectively selecting fewer and most informative data samples for fine-tuning.
Through extensive experiments across several datasets and vision backbones, we
demonstrate that our solution can match and exceed the performance of complex
feature-based sampling techniques while being computationally very efficient.
Additionally, we investigate the efficacy of Prompt learning versus Low-rank
adaptation (LoRA) in sample selection, providing a detailed comparative
analysis of these methods in the context of efficient AL.

Conclusion: Chain-of-Cooking模型通过创新的模块设计，有效解决了烹饪过程可视化中的关键问题，为相关领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Cooking process visualization is a promising task in the intersection of
image generation and food analysis, which aims to generate an image for each
cooking step of a recipe. However, most existing works focus on generating
images of finished foods based on the given recipes, and face two challenges to
visualize the cooking process. First, the appearance of ingredients changes
variously across cooking steps, it is difficult to generate the correct
appearances of foods that match the textual description, leading to semantic
inconsistency. Second, the current step might depend on the operations of
previous step, it is crucial to maintain the contextual coherence of images in
sequential order. In this work, we present a cooking process visualization
model, called Chain-of-Cooking. Specifically, to generate correct appearances
of ingredients, we present a Dynamic Patch Selection Module to retrieve
previously generated image patches as references, which are most related to
current textual contents. Furthermore, to enhance the coherence and keep the
rational order of generated images, we propose a Semantic Evolution Module and
a Bidirectional Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Guidance. To better utilize the
semantics of previous texts, the Semantic Evolution Module establishes the
semantical association between latent prompts and current cooking step, and
merges it with the latent features. Then the CoT Guidance updates the merged
features to guide the current cooking step remain coherent with the previous
step. Moreover, we construct a dataset named CookViz, consisting of
intermediate image-text pairs for the cooking process. Quantitative and
qualitative experiments show that our method outperforms existing methods in
generating coherent and semantic consistent cooking process.

Result: 实验表明，CS-DFD在多个基准测试中实现了最先进的检测精度和跨域泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过解决梯度冲突，CS-DFD显著提升了深度伪造检测的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Robust deepfake detection models must be capable of generalizing to
ever-evolving manipulation techniques beyond training data. A promising
strategy is to augment the training data with online synthesized fake images
containing broadly generalizable artifacts. However, in the context of deepfake
detection, it is surprising that jointly training on both original and online
synthesized forgeries may result in degraded performance. This contradicts the
common belief that incorporating more source-domain data should enhance
detection accuracy. Through empirical analysis, we trace this degradation to
gradient conflicts during backpropagation which force a trade-off between
source domain accuracy and target domain generalization. To overcome this
issue, we propose a Conflict-Suppressed Deepfake Detection (CS-DFD) framework
that explicitly mitigates the gradient conflict via two synergistic modules.
First, an Update Vector Search (UVS) module searches for an alternative update
vector near the initial gradient vector to reconcile the disparities of the
original and online synthesized forgeries. By further transforming the search
process into an extremum optimization problem, UVS yields the uniquely update
vector, which maximizes the simultaneous loss reductions for each data type.
Second, a Conflict Gradient Reduction (CGR) module enforces a low-conflict
feature embedding space through a novel Conflict Descent Loss. This loss
penalizes misaligned gradient directions and guides the learning of
representations with aligned, non-conflicting gradients. The synergy of UVS and
CGR alleviates gradient interference in both parameter optimization and
representation learning. Experiments on multiple deepfake benchmarks
demonstrate that CS-DFD achieves state-of-the-art performance in both in-domain
detection accuracy and cross-domain generalization.

Conclusion: 交互式在线经验对扩展机器人基础模型至关重要。

Abstract: Navigation foundation models trained on massive webscale data enable agents
to generalize across diverse environments and embodiments. However, these
models trained solely on offline data, often lack the capacity to reason about
the consequences of their actions or adapt through counterfactual
understanding. They thus face significant limitations in the real-world urban
navigation where interactive and safe behaviors, such as avoiding obstacles and
moving pedestrians, are critical. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the
Seeing-to-Experiencing framework to scale the capability of navigation
foundation models with reinforcement learning. S2E combines the strengths of
pre-training on videos and post-training through RL. It maintains the
generalizability acquired from large-scale real-world videos while enhancing
its interactivity through RL in simulation environments. Specifically, we
introduce two innovations: an Anchor-Guided Distribution Matching strategy,
which stabilizes learning and models diverse motion patterns through
anchor-based supervision; and a Residual-Attention Module, which obtains
reactive behaviors from simulation environments without erasing the model's
pretrained knowledge. Moreover, we establish a comprehensive end-to-end
evaluation benchmark, NavBench-GS, built on photorealistic 3DGS reconstructions
of real-world scenes that incorporate physical interactions. It can
systematically assess the generalizability and safety of navigation foundation
models. Extensive experiments show that S2E mitigates the diminishing returns
often seen when scaling with offline data alone. We perform a thorough analysis
of the benefits of Reinforcement Learning compared to Supervised Fine-Tuning in
the context of post-training for robot learning. Our findings emphasize the
crucial role of integrating interactive online experiences to effectively scale
foundation models in Robotics.

Abstract: Attitude sensors determine the spacecraft attitude through the sensing of an
astronomical object, field or other phenomena. The Sun and fixed stars are the
two primary astronomical sensing objects. Attitude sensors are critical
components for the survival and knowledge improvement of spacecraft. Of these,
sun sensors are the most common and important sensor for spacecraft attitude
determination. The sun sensor measures the Sun vector in spacecraft
coordinates. The sun sensor calibration process is particularly difficult due
to the complex nature of the uncertainties involved. The uncertainties are
small, difficult to observe, and vary spatio-temporally over the lifecycle of
the sensor. In addition, the sensors are affected by numerous sources of
uncertainties, including manufacturing, electrical, environmental, and
interference sources. This motivates the development of advanced calibration
algorithms to minimize uncertainty over the sensor lifecycle and improve
accuracy. Although modeling and calibration techniques for sun sensors have
been explored extensively in the literature over the past two decades, there is
currently no resource that consolidates and systematically reviews this body of
work. The present review proposes a systematic mapping of sun sensor modeling
and calibration algorithms across a breadth of sensor configurations. It
specifically provides a comprehensive survey of each methodology, along with an
analysis of research gaps and recommendations for future directions in sun
sensor modeling and calibration techniques.

Abstract: Online high-definition (HD) map construction plays an increasingly important
role in scaling autonomous driving systems. Transformer-based methods have
become prevalent in online HD map construction; however, existing approaches
often neglect the inherent spatial and semantic relationships among map
elements, which limits their accuracy and generalization. To address this, we
propose RelMap, an end-to-end framework that enhances online map construction
by incorporating spatial relations and semantic priors. We introduce a
Class-aware Spatial Relation Prior, which explicitly encodes relative
positional dependencies between map elements using a learnable class-aware
relation encoder. Additionally, we propose a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based
Semantic Prior, which routes features to class-specific experts based on
predicted class probabilities, refining instance feature decoding. Our method
is compatible with both single-frame and temporal perception backbones,
achieving state-of-the-art performance on both the nuScenes and Argoverse 2
datasets.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are widely used in many computer vision
tasks. Yet, their increasing size and complexity pose significant challenges
for efficient deployment on resource-constrained platforms. Hence, network
pruning has emerged as an effective way of reducing the size and computational
requirements of neural networks by removing redundant or unimportant
parameters. However, a fundamental challenge with pruning consists in optimally
removing redundancies without degrading performance. Most existing pruning
techniques overlook structural dependencies across feature maps within a layer,
resulting in suboptimal pruning decisions. In this work, we introduce LinDeps,
a novel post-pruning method, i.e., a pruning method that can be applied on top
of any pruning technique, which systematically identifies and removes redundant
filters via linear dependency analysis. Particularly, LinDeps applies pivoted
QR decomposition to feature maps to detect and prune linearly dependent
filters. Then, a novel signal recovery mechanism adjusts the next layer's
kernels to preserve compatibility and performance without requiring any
fine-tuning. Our experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet with VGG and ResNet
backbones demonstrate that LinDeps improves compression rates of existing
pruning techniques while preserving performances, leading to a new state of the
art in CNN pruning. We also benchmark LinDeps in low-resource setups where no
retraining can be performed, which shows significant pruning improvements and
inference speedups over a state-of-the-art method. LinDeps therefore
constitutes an essential add-on for any current or future pruning technique.

*Kejia Zhang,Keda Tao,Zhiming Luo,Chang Liu,Jiasheng Tang,Huan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出TARS方法，通过动态调整偏好优化策略，减少多模态大语言模型的幻觉问题，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有直接偏好优化（DPO）方法在处理多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的幻觉问题时，依赖静态监督信号，容易过拟合，导致视觉信息的基础不牢。

Method: 提出TARS方法，将DPO重新定义为最小-最大优化问题，通过最大化语义约束下的标记级分布偏移来模拟对齐不确定性，同时最小化偏好损失。

Result: 在多个幻觉基准测试中，TARS仅用4.8k偏好样本和无专家反馈，将幻觉率从26.4%降至13.2%，认知值从2.5降至0.4，性能优于标准DPO并接近GPT-4o。

Conclusion: TARS通过动态优化策略有效减少幻觉问题，同时保持视觉信息的因果基础，为多模态推理提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable vision-language reasoning,
yet often generate plausible outputs that are factually incorrect or visually
ungrounded, thereby compromising their reliability. Direct preference
optimization (DPO) is a common strategy for correcting hallucinations by
aligning model outputs with human preferences. Existing DPO strategies
typically treat hallucination-related preferences as fixed targets, relying on
static supervision signals during training. This approach tends to overfit to
superficial linguistic cues in preference data, leading to distributional
rigidity and spurious correlations that impair grounding in causally relevant
visual information. To overcome this limitation, we propose TARS, a
token-adaptive preference strategy that reformulates DPO as a min-max
optimization problem. TARS maximizes token-level distributional shifts under
semantic constraints to simulate alignment uncertainty, and simultaneously
minimizes the expected preference loss under these controlled perturbations.
This joint objective preserves causal grounding while mitigating overfitting to
preference patterns, thereby reducing hallucinations in multimodal reasoning.
We evaluate TARS on multiple hallucination benchmarks and find consistently
strong performance. Using only 4.8k preference samples and no expert feedback,
TARS reduces hallucination rates from 26.4% to 13.2% and decreases cognition
value from 2.5 to 0.4. It outperforms standard DPO and matches GPT-4o on
several key metrics.

Result: 总结了最新技术与进展，评估了现有方法的局限性。

Conclusion: 指出了当前挑战与未来研究方向，为熟悉WSSS的研究者提供深入见解。

Abstract: Unlike fully supervised semantic segmentation, weakly supervised semantic
segmentation (WSSS) relies on weaker forms of supervision to perform dense
prediction tasks. Among the various types of weak supervision, WSSS with image
level annotations is considered both the most challenging and the most
practical, attracting significant research attention. Therefore, in this
review, we focus on WSSS with image level annotations. Additionally, this
review concentrates on mainstream research directions, deliberately omitting
less influential branches.
  Given the rapid development of new methods and the limitations of existing
surveys in capturing recent trends, there is a pressing need for an updated and
comprehensive review. Our goal is to fill this gap by synthesizing the latest
advancements and state-of-the-art techniques in WSSS with image level labels.
  Basically, we provide a comprehensive review of recent advancements in WSSS
with image level labels, categorizing existing methods based on the types and
levels of additional supervision involved. We also examine the challenges of
applying advanced methods to domain specific datasets in WSSS,a topic that
remains underexplored. Finally, we discuss the current challenges, evaluate the
limitations of existing approaches, and outline several promising directions
for future research. This review is intended for researchers who are already
familiar with the fundamental concepts of WSSS and are seeking to deepen their
understanding of current advances and methodological innovations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于潜在扩散模型的新方法，用于局部选择性面部老化，解决了现有方法将老化视为全局同质过程的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如GANs和扩散模型）通常基于参考图像和目标年龄生成老化效果，但忽略了面部区域因内在和外在因素而异的老化过程。

Method: 利用潜在扩散模型选择性老化特定面部区域，并通过潜在扩散细化器无缝融合局部老化区域，实现全局一致的自然合成。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在身份保持、高保真图像生成以及自然可控的老化过程三个方面表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了更精细、更个性化的面部老化，为相关领域提供了新的技术方向。

Abstract: We present a novel approach to face aging that addresses the limitations of
current methods which treat aging as a global, homogeneous process. Existing
techniques using GANs and diffusion models often condition generation on a
reference image and target age, neglecting that facial regions age
heterogeneously due to both intrinsic chronological factors and extrinsic
elements like sun exposure. Our method leverages latent diffusion models to
selectively age specific facial regions using local aging signs. This approach
provides significantly finer-grained control over the generation process,
enabling more realistic and personalized aging. We employ a latent diffusion
refiner to seamlessly blend these locally aged regions, ensuring a globally
consistent and natural-looking synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that
our method effectively achieves three key criteria for successful face aging:
robust identity preservation, high-fidelity and realistic imagery, and a
natural, controllable aging progression.

Result: 在多个基准数据集上表现优异，性能提升显著（如GOT10K上AUC提升25.3%）。

Conclusion: SSTrack通过自监督学习有效减少对标注数据的依赖，性能超越现有方法。

Abstract: The success of visual tracking has been largely driven by datasets with
manual box annotations. However, these box annotations require tremendous human
effort, limiting the scale and diversity of existing tracking datasets. In this
work, we present a novel Self-Supervised Tracking framework named
\textbf{{\tracker}}, designed to eliminate the need of box annotations.
Specifically, a decoupled spatio-temporal consistency training framework is
proposed to learn rich target information across timestamps through global
spatial localization and local temporal association. This allows for the
simulation of appearance and motion variations of instances in real-world
scenarios. Furthermore, an instance contrastive loss is designed to learn
instance-level correspondences from a multi-view perspective, offering robust
instance supervision without additional labels. This new design paradigm
enables {\tracker} to effectively learn generic tracking representations in a
self-supervised manner, while reducing reliance on extensive box annotations.
Extensive experiments on nine benchmark datasets demonstrate that {\tracker}
surpasses \textit{SOTA} self-supervised tracking methods, achieving an
improvement of more than 25.3\%, 20.4\%, and 14.8\% in AUC (AO) score on the
GOT10K, LaSOT, TrackingNet datasets, respectively. Code:

TL;DR: DeepLabv3模型在iPS细胞集落分割任务中表现优于大型基础模型（如SAM2和MedSAM2），表明在特定任务中，简单模型可能更有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究探讨在医学图像分割中，复杂模型是否总是优于简单模型，尤其是在低对比度边界等挑战性条件下。

Method: 使用DeepLabv3模型进行iPS细胞集落分割，并与SAM2和MedSAM2等大型基础模型对比。

Result: DeepLabv3在实验条件下表现更优，表明模型复杂性不总是带来性能提升。

Conclusion: 在特定生物医学任务中，适当调整的简单模型可能比大型通用模型更可靠且准确。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation requires not only accuracy but also robustness
under challenging imaging conditions. In this study, we show that a carefully
configured DeepLabv3 model can achieve high performance in segmenting induced
pluripotent stem (iPS) cell colonies, and, under our experimental conditions,
outperforms large-scale foundation models such as SAM2 and its medical variant
MedSAM2 without structural modifications. These results suggest that, for
specialized tasks characterized by subtle, low-contrast boundaries, increased
model complexity does not necessarily translate to better performance. Our work
revisits the assumption that ever-larger and more generalized architectures are
always preferable, and provides evidence that appropriately adapted, simpler
models may offer strong accuracy and practical reliability in domain-specific
biomedical applications. We also offer an open-source implementation that
includes strategies for small datasets and domain-specific encoding, with the
aim of supporting further advances in semantic segmentation for regenerative
medicine and related fields.

Result: 模型在合成和真实图像上表现优异，Pose mAP50-95达到0.97。

Conclusion: 合成数据方法有效提升了模型性能，适用于复杂场景的风力涡轮机检测。

Abstract: For the autonomous drone-based inspection of wind turbine (WT) blades,
accurate detection of the WT and its key features is essential for safe drone
positioning and collision avoidance. Existing deep learning methods typically
rely on manually labeled real-world images, which limits both the quantity and
the diversity of training datasets in terms of weather conditions, lighting,
turbine types, and image complexity. In this paper, we propose a method to
generate synthetic training data that allows controlled variation of visual and
environmental factors, increasing the diversity and hence creating challenging
learning scenarios. Furthermore, we train a YOLOv11 feature detection network
solely on synthetic WT images with a modified loss function, to detect WTs and
their key features within an image. The resulting network is evaluated both
using synthetic images and a set of real-world WT images and shows promising
performance across both synthetic and real-world data, achieving a Pose
mAP50-95 of 0.97 on real images never seen during training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业异常检测（IAD）对制造系统的安全性和可靠性至关重要，但MLLMs在IAD中的效果有限，需领域适应。

Method: 提出EMIT框架，包括多任务数据集构建、GPT生成文本描述、软提示和热图对比嵌入，以及难度感知GRPO策略。

Result: 在MMAD基准测试中，EMIT显著提升MLLMs的IAD性能，平均提升7.77%。

Conclusion: EMIT通过难度感知优化有效提升了MLLMs在工业异常检测中的表现。

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection (IAD) plays a crucial role in maintaining the
safety and reliability of manufacturing systems. While multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) show strong vision-language reasoning abilities, their
effectiveness in IAD remains limited without domain-specific adaptation. In
this work, we propose EMIT, a unified framework that enhances MLLMs for IAD via
difficulty-aware group relative policy optimization (GRPO). EMIT constructs a
multi-task IAD dataset and utilizes GPT-generated object text descriptions to
compensate for missing defective images. For few-shot anomaly detection, it
integrates a soft prompt and heatmap-guided contrastive embeddings derived from
patch-level comparisons. To better handle difficult data samples, i.e., cases
where the MLLM struggles to generate correct answers, we propose a
difficulty-aware GRPO that extends the original GRPO by incorporating a
response resampling strategy to ensure the inclusion of correct answers in the
sampled responses, as well as an advantage reweighting mechanism to strengthen
learning from such difficult data samples. Extensive experiments on the MMAD
benchmark demonstrate that EMIT significantly enhances the IAD performance of
MLLMs, achieving an average improvement of 7.77\% over the base model
(InternVL3-8B) across seven tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的多模态修复方法需要架构修改和重新训练，计算成本高；而上下文感知方法缺乏对掩码区域的精细控制，导致语义不一致。

Method: GuidPaint结合分类器引导和随机/确定性采样，精确控制掩码区域的中间生成。

Result: 实验表明，GuidPaint在定性和定量评估上均优于现有上下文感知修复方法。

Conclusion: GuidPaint通过分类器引导实现了高质量的图像修复，无需额外训练，且具有更好的控制能力。

Abstract: In recent years, diffusion models have been widely adopted for image
inpainting tasks due to their powerful generative capabilities, achieving
impressive results. Existing multimodal inpainting methods based on diffusion
models often require architectural modifications and retraining, resulting in
high computational cost. In contrast, context-aware diffusion inpainting
methods leverage the model's inherent priors to adjust intermediate denoising
steps, enabling high-quality inpainting without additional training and
significantly reducing computation. However, these methods lack fine-grained
control over the masked regions, often leading to semantically inconsistent or
visually implausible content. To address this issue, we propose GuidPaint, a
training-free, class-guided image inpainting framework. By incorporating
classifier guidance into the denoising process, GuidPaint enables precise
control over intermediate generations within the masked areas, ensuring both
semantic consistency and visual realism. Furthermore, it integrates stochastic
and deterministic sampling, allowing users to select preferred intermediate
results and deterministically refine them. Experimental results demonstrate
that GuidPaint achieves clear improvements over existing context-aware
inpainting methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

LLMs, VAD has undergone significant transformations in terms of data
annotation, input modalities, model architectures, and task objectives. The
surge in publications and the evolution of tasks have created an urgent need

technological advancements and existing bottlenecks, this paper distills key
challenges and outlines future research directions, offering guidance for the

Abstract: Monitoring benthic biodiversity in Antarctica is vital for understanding
ecological change in response to climate-driven pressures. This work is
typically performed using high-resolution imagery captured in situ, though
manual annotation of such data remains laborious and specialised, impeding
large-scale analysis. We present a tailored object detection framework for
identifying and classifying Antarctic benthic organisms in high-resolution
towed camera imagery, alongside the first public computer vision dataset for
benthic biodiversity monitoring in the Weddell Sea. Our approach addresses key
challenges associated with marine ecological imagery, including limited
annotated data, variable object sizes, and complex seafloor structure. The
proposed framework combines resolution-preserving patching, spatial data
augmentation, fine-tuning, and postprocessing via Slicing Aided Hyper
Inference. We benchmark multiple object detection architectures and demonstrate
strong performance in detecting medium and large organisms across 25
fine-grained morphotypes, significantly more than other works in this area.
Detection of small and rare taxa remains a challenge, reflecting limitations in
current detection architectures. Our framework provides a scalable foundation
for future machine-assisted in situ benthic biodiversity monitoring research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于补丁的方法在高分辨率图像生成中存在分布偏移和单调性问题，限制了生成质量。

Method: 提出APT框架，结合统计匹配和尺度感知调度，优化补丁分布和去噪路径。

Result: APT生成更清晰的高分辨率图像，同时加快采样速度。

Conclusion: APT为高分辨率图像生成提供了一种高效且质量更高的解决方案。

Abstract: Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) are generally trained at fixed resolutions,
limiting their capability when scaling up to high-resolution images. While
training-based approaches address this limitation by training on
high-resolution datasets, they require large amounts of data and considerable
computational resources, making them less practical. Consequently,
training-free methods, particularly patch-based approaches, have become a
popular alternative. These methods divide an image into patches and fuse the
denoising paths of each patch, showing strong performance on high-resolution
generation. However, we observe two critical issues for patch-based approaches,
which we call ``patch-level distribution shift" and ``increased patch
monotonicity." To address these issues, we propose Adaptive Path Tracing (APT),
a framework that combines Statistical Matching to ensure patch distributions
remain consistent in upsampled latents and Scale-aware Scheduling to deal with
the patch monotonicity. As a result, APT produces clearer and more refined
details in high-resolution images. In addition, APT enables a shortcut
denoising process, resulting in faster sampling with minimal quality
degradation. Our experimental results confirm that APT produces more detailed
outputs with improved inference speed, providing a practical approach to
high-resolution image generation.

Result: 在七个数据集和三个下游任务中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架在保护隐私的同时有效保留了医学语义，性能领先。

Abstract: Medical imaging has significantly advanced computer-aided diagnosis, yet its
re-identification (ReID) risks raise critical privacy concerns, calling for
de-identification (DeID) techniques. Unfortunately, existing DeID methods
neither particularly preserve medical semantics, nor are flexibly adjustable
towards different privacy levels. To address these issues, we propose a
divide-and-conquer framework comprising two steps: (1) Identity-Blocking, which
blocks varying proportions of identity-related regions, to achieve different
privacy levels; and (2) Medical-Semantics-Compensation, which leverages
pre-trained Medical Foundation Models (MFMs) to extract medical semantic
features to compensate the blocked regions. Moreover, recognizing that features
from MFMs may still contain residual identity information, we introduce a
Minimum Description Length principle-based feature decoupling strategy, to
effectively decouple and discard such identity components. Extensive
evaluations against existing approaches across seven datasets and three
downstream tasks, demonstrates our state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: We introduce local matching stability and furthest matchable frame as
quantitative measures for evaluating the success of underwater image
enhancement. This enhancement process addresses visual degradation caused by
light absorption, scattering, marine growth, and debris. Enhanced imagery plays
a critical role in downstream tasks such as path detection and autonomous
navigation for underwater vehicles, relying on robust feature extraction and
frame matching. To assess the impact of enhancement techniques on
frame-matching performance, we propose a novel evaluation framework tailored to
underwater environments. Through metric-based analysis, we identify strengths
and limitations of existing approaches and pinpoint gaps in their assessment of
real-world applicability. By incorporating a practical matching strategy, our
framework offers a robust, context-aware benchmark for comparing enhancement
methods. Finally, we demonstrate how visual improvements affect the performance
of a complete real-world algorithm -- Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
(SLAM) -- reinforcing the framework's relevance to operational underwater
scenarios.

Abstract: In recent years, Explainable AI has gained traction as an approach to
enhancing model interpretability and transparency, particularly in complex
models such as detection transformers. Despite rapid advancements, a
substantial research gap remains in understanding the distinct roles of
internal components - knowledge that is essential for improving transparency
and efficiency. Inspired by neuroscientific ablation studies, which investigate
the functions of brain regions through selective impairment, we systematically
analyze the impact of ablating key components in three state-of-the-art
detection transformer models: Detection transformer (DETR), deformable
detection transformer (DDETR), and DETR with improved denoising anchor boxes
(DINO). The ablations target query embeddings, encoder and decoder multi-head
self-attentions (MHSA) as well as decoder multi-head cross-attention (MHCA)
layers. We evaluate the effects of these ablations on the performance metrics
gIoU and F1-score, quantifying effects on both the classification and
regression sub-tasks on the COCO dataset. To facilitate reproducibility and
future research, we publicly release the DeepDissect library. Our findings
reveal model-specific resilience patterns: while DETR is particularly sensitive
to ablations in encoder MHSA and decoder MHCA, DDETR's multi-scale deformable
attention enhances robustness, and DINO exhibits the greatest resilience due to
its look-forward twice update rule, which helps distributing knowledge across
blocks. These insights also expose structural redundancies, particularly in
DDETR's and DINO's decoder MHCA layers, highlighting opportunities for model
simplification without sacrificing performance. This study advances XAI for
DETRs by clarifying the contributions of internal components to model
performance, offering insights to optimize and improve transparency and
efficiency in critical applications.

<details>

Motivation: 现有VOT方法忽视时间依赖或泛化性差，且无法有效处理遮挡和干扰。

Method: 提出SAMITE模型，包含原型记忆库（筛选最佳帧）和位置提示生成器（提供位置线索）。

Result: 在六个基准测试中表现优越。

Conclusion: SAMITE有效解决了遮挡和干扰问题，提升了跟踪性能。

Abstract: Visual Object Tracking (VOT) is widely used in applications like autonomous
driving to continuously track targets in videos. Existing methods can be
roughly categorized into template matching and autoregressive methods, where
the former usually neglects the temporal dependencies across frames and the
latter tends to get biased towards the object categories during training,
showing weak generalizability to unseen classes. To address these issues, some
methods propose to adapt the video foundation model SAM2 for VOT, where the
tracking results of each frame would be encoded as memory for conditioning the
rest of frames in an autoregressive manner. Nevertheless, existing methods fail
to overcome the challenges of object occlusions and distractions, and do not
have any measures to intercept the propagation of tracking errors. To tackle
them, we present a SAMITE model, built upon SAM2 with additional modules,
including: (1) Prototypical Memory Bank: We propose to quantify the
feature-wise and position-wise correctness of each frame's tracking results,
and select the best frames to condition subsequent frames. As the features of
occluded and distracting objects are feature-wise and position-wise inaccurate,
their scores would naturally be lower and thus can be filtered to intercept
error propagation; (2) Positional Prompt Generator: To further reduce the
impacts of distractors, we propose to generate positional mask prompts to
provide explicit positional clues for the target, leading to more accurate
tracking. Extensive experiments have been conducted on six benchmarks, showing
the superiority of SAMITE. The code is available at

*Shijie Wang,Jian Shi,Haojie Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AdvRF提出了一种对抗性重建反馈框架，用于学习类别无关的差异表示，以解决现有细粒度图像检索方法对预定义类别的依赖问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有细粒度图像检索方法依赖于预定义类别的监督，导致检索表示中引入类别特定语义，限制了模型对未见类别的泛化能力。

Method: AdvRF通过结合检索模型的类别感知差异定位和重建模型的类别无关特征学习，将细粒度图像检索重新定义为视觉差异重建任务。

Result: AdvRF在细粒度和粗粒度数据集上均表现出色。

Conclusion: AdvRF通过对抗性重建反馈框架，成功实现了类别无关的差异表示学习，提升了模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Existing fine-grained image retrieval (FGIR) methods predominantly rely on
supervision from predefined categories to learn discriminative representations
for retrieving fine-grained objects. However, they inadvertently introduce
category-specific semantics into the retrieval representation, creating
semantic dependencies on predefined classes that critically hinder
generalization to unseen categories. To tackle this, we propose AdvRF, a novel
adversarial reconstruction feedback framework aimed at learning
category-agnostic discrepancy representations. Specifically, AdvRF reformulates
FGIR as a visual discrepancy reconstruction task via synergizing category-aware
discrepancy localization from retrieval models with category-agnostic feature
learning from reconstruction models. The reconstruction model exposes residual
discrepancies overlooked by the retrieval model, forcing it to improve
localization accuracy, while the refined signals from the retrieval model guide
the reconstruction model to improve its reconstruction ability. Consequently,
the retrieval model localizes visual differences, while the reconstruction
model encodes these differences into category-agnostic representations. This
representation is then transferred to the retrieval model through knowledge
distillation for efficient deployment. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations
demonstrate that our AdvRF achieves impressive performance on both widely-used
fine-grained and coarse-grained datasets.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于少量样本的强化学习框架（RLVR），用于卫星图像任务，无需标注数据，仅需轻量级规则奖励。实验表明，仅需一个样本即可显著提升性能，128样本可媲美数千标注样本的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决遥感等专业领域标注数据稀缺且昂贵的问题，提出一种无需标注监督的数据高效方法。

Method: 采用1-shot RLVR框架，结合策略梯度优化和轻量级规则奖励（如IoU），仅需少量样本即可训练模型。

Result: 在多个遥感任务（分类、视觉问答、定位）中，1个样本即可显著提升性能，128样本达到或超越传统大规模标注模型。

Conclusion: RLVR框架为数据稀缺领域提供了一种高效、低成本的解决方案，通过少量样本和规则奖励实现高性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language and vision-language models have enabled
strong reasoning capabilities, yet they remain impractical for specialized
domains like remote sensing, where annotated data is scarce and expensive. We
present the first few-shot reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (RLVR)
framework for satellite imagery that eliminates the need for caption
supervision--relying solely on lightweight, rule-based binary or IoU-based
rewards. Adapting the "1-shot RLVR" paradigm from language models to
vision-language models, we employ policy-gradient optimization with as few as
one curated example to align model outputs for satellite reasoning tasks.
Comprehensive experiments across multiple remote sensing benchmarks--including
classification, visual question answering, and grounding--show that even a
single example yields substantial improvements over the base model. Scaling to
128 examples matches or exceeds models trained on thousands of annotated
samples. While the extreme one-shot setting can induce mild, task-specific
overfitting, our approach consistently demonstrates robust generalization and
efficiency across diverse tasks. Further, we find that prompt design and loss
weighting significantly influence training stability and final accuracy. Our
method enables cost-effective and data-efficient development of
domain-specialist vision-language reasoning models, offering a pragmatic recipe
for data-scarce fields: start from a compact VLM, curate a handful of
reward-checkable cases, and train via RLVR.

TL;DR: LiteFat是一种轻量级时空图学习模型，用于高效检测驾驶员疲劳，具有高精度和低计算需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 驾驶员疲劳是交通事故的主要原因，现有深度学习模型计算量大，不适合资源有限的嵌入式设备。

Method: 将视频数据转换为时空图（STG），使用MobileNet提取面部特征，轻量级时空图神经网络检测疲劳。

Result: 在基准数据集上表现优异，显著降低计算复杂度和延迟。

Conclusion: LiteFat为嵌入式设备提供了实时、高效的疲劳检测解决方案。

Abstract: Detecting driver fatigue is critical for road safety, as drowsy driving
remains a leading cause of traffic accidents. Many existing solutions rely on
computationally demanding deep learning models, which result in high latency
and are unsuitable for embedded robotic devices with limited resources (such as
intelligent vehicles/cars) where rapid detection is necessary to prevent
accidents. This paper introduces LiteFat, a lightweight spatio-temporal graph
learning model designed to detect driver fatigue efficiently while maintaining
high accuracy and low computational demands. LiteFat involves converting
streaming video data into spatio-temporal graphs (STG) using facial landmark
detection, which focuses on key motion patterns and reduces unnecessary data
processing. LiteFat uses MobileNet to extract facial features and create a
feature matrix for the STG. A lightweight spatio-temporal graph neural network
is then employed to identify signs of fatigue with minimal processing and low
latency. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that LiteFat performs
competitively while significantly decreasing computational complexity and
latency as compared to current state-of-the-art methods. This work enables the
development of real-time, resource-efficient human fatigue detection systems
that can be implemented upon embedded robotic devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准ViT存在参数冗余和计算成本高的问题，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出MoR-ViT框架，采用token级动态递归机制，自适应确定处理深度。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K上实现SOTA精度，参数减少70%，推理加速2.5倍。

Conclusion: 动态递归是高效ViT的有效策略，为实际部署提供了新思路。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved remarkable success in image
recognition, yet standard ViT architectures are hampered by substantial
parameter redundancy and high computational cost, limiting their practical
deployment. While recent efforts on efficient ViTs primarily focus on static
model compression or token-level sparsification, they remain constrained by
fixed computational depth for all tokens. In this work, we present MoR-ViT, a
novel vision transformer framework that, for the first time, incorporates a
token-level dynamic recursion mechanism inspired by the Mixture-of-Recursions
(MoR) paradigm. This approach enables each token to adaptively determine its
processing depth, yielding a flexible and input-dependent allocation of
computational resources. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K and transfer
benchmarks demonstrate that MoR-ViT not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy
with up to 70% parameter reduction and 2.5x inference acceleration, but also
outperforms leading efficient ViT baselines such as DynamicViT and TinyViT
under comparable conditions. These results establish dynamic recursion as an
effective strategy for efficient vision transformers and open new avenues for
scalable and deployable deep learning models in real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为AU-LLM的新框架，首次利用大型语言模型（LLM）检测微表情动作单元（AUs），解决了数据稀缺和强度低的问题，并通过增强融合投影器（EFP）弥合视觉-语言语义鸿沟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微表情AUs检测是情感计算中的关键挑战，但现有方法在数据稀缺和低强度情况下表现不佳。LLMs具有强大的推理能力，但其在微表情领域的应用尚未探索。

Method: 提出AU-LLM框架，利用3D-CNN提取视觉特征，并通过EFP（多层感知机）融合局部纹理和全局语义特征，生成紧凑表示供LLM推理。

Result: 在CASME II和SAMM数据集上，AU-LLM通过LOSO和跨域协议测试，取得了新的最优性能。

Conclusion: AU-LLM展示了LLM在微表情分析中的巨大潜力，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: The detection of micro-expression Action Units (AUs) is a formidable
challenge in affective computing, pivotal for decoding subtle, involuntary
human emotions. While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate profound
reasoning abilities, their application to the fine-grained, low-intensity
domain of micro-expression AU detection remains unexplored. This paper pioneers
this direction by introducing \textbf{AU-LLM}, a novel framework that for the
first time uses LLM to detect AUs in micro-expression datasets with subtle
intensities and the scarcity of data. We specifically address the critical
vision-language semantic gap, the \textbf{Enhanced Fusion Projector (EFP)}. The
EFP employs a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to intelligently fuse mid-level
(local texture) and high-level (global semantics) visual features from a
specialized 3D-CNN backbone into a single, information-dense token. This
compact representation effectively empowers the LLM to perform nuanced
reasoning over subtle facial muscle movements.Through extensive evaluations on
the benchmark CASME II and SAMM datasets, including stringent
Leave-One-Subject-Out (LOSO) and cross-domain protocols, AU-LLM establishes a
new state-of-the-art, validating the significant potential and robustness of
LLM-based reasoning for micro-expression analysis. The codes are available at

Motivation: 现有方法在新类别泛化上表现不佳，且复杂架构或计算开销大。

Result: 在11个基准数据集上，MSGCoOp显著提升基类到新类的泛化性能，平均谐波均值提升1.10%。

Conclusion: MSGCoOp在少样本和跨域泛化任务中表现优异，计算高效。

Abstract: Vision-language pre-trained models (VLMs) such as CLIP have demonstrated
remarkable zero-shot generalization, and prompt learning has emerged as an
efficient alternative to full fine-tuning. However, existing methods often
struggle with generalization to novel classes, a phenomenon attributed to
overfitting on seen classes and forgetting general knowledge. Furthermore,
recent approaches that improve generalization often introduce complex
architectures or heavy computational overhead. In this paper, we propose a
Multiple Semantic-Guided Context Optimization (MSGCoOp) framework to enhance
few-shot generalization while maintaining computational efficiency. Our
approach leverages an ensemble of parallel learnable context vectors to capture
diverse semantic aspects. To enrich these prompts, we introduce a semantic
guidance mechanism that aligns them with comprehensive class descriptions
automatically generated by a Large Language Model (LLM). Furthermore, a
diversity regularization loss encourages the prompts to learn complementary and
orthogonal features, preventing them from collapsing into redundant
representations. Extensive experiments on 11 benchmark datasets show that
MSGCoOp significantly improves performance on base-to-novel generalization,
achieving an average harmonic mean improvement of 1.10\% over the strong KgCoOp
baseline. Our method also demonstrates enhanced robustness in cross-domain
generalization tasks. Our code is avaliable at:

Result: 模型在多个下游任务中取得最先进性能。

Conclusion: 不确定性感知的预训练框架显著提升了医学图像-文本对齐和下游任务表现。

Abstract: Medical image-language pre-training aims to align medical images with
clinically relevant text to improve model performance on various downstream
tasks. However, existing models often struggle with the variability and
ambiguity inherent in medical data, limiting their ability to capture nuanced
clinical information and uncertainty. This work introduces an uncertainty-aware
medical image-text pre-training model that enhances generalization capabilities
in medical image analysis. Building on previous methods and focusing on Chest
X-Rays, our approach utilizes structured text reports generated by a large
language model (LLM) to augment image data with clinically relevant context.
These reports begin with a definition of the disease, followed by the
`appearance' section to highlight critical regions of interest, and finally
`observations' and `verdicts' that ground model predictions in clinical
semantics. By modeling both inter- and intra-modal uncertainty, our framework
captures the inherent ambiguity in medical images and text, yielding improved
representations and performance on downstream tasks. Our model demonstrates
significant advances in medical image-text pre-training, obtaining
state-of-the-art performance on multiple downstream tasks.

Abstract: Creating immersive and playable 3D worlds from texts or images remains a
fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics. Existing world
generation approaches typically fall into two categories: video-based methods
that offer rich diversity but lack 3D consistency and rendering efficiency, and
3D-based methods that provide geometric consistency but struggle with limited
training data and memory-inefficient representations. To address these
limitations, we present HunyuanWorld 1.0, a novel framework that combines the
best of both worlds for generating immersive, explorable, and interactive 3D
scenes from text and image conditions. Our approach features three key
advantages: 1) 360{\deg} immersive experiences via panoramic world proxies; 2)
mesh export capabilities for seamless compatibility with existing computer
graphics pipelines; 3) disentangled object representations for augmented
interactivity. The core of our framework is a semantically layered 3D mesh
representation that leverages panoramic images as 360{\deg} world proxies for
semantic-aware world decomposition and reconstruction, enabling the generation
of diverse 3D worlds. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating coherent, explorable, and
interactive 3D worlds while enabling versatile applications in virtual reality,

Result: 研究发现，从输入过滤到输出验证的每个审核阶段均可被绕过，且这些策略易于在现实场景中复现。

Conclusion: 当前防御措施不足以应对非专家的越狱攻击，亟需开发上下文感知的防御机制。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in alignment and content moderation, large
language models (LLMs) and text-to-image (T2I) systems remain vulnerable to
prompt-based attacks known as jailbreaks. Unlike traditional adversarial
examples requiring expert knowledge, many of today's jailbreaks are low-effort,
high-impact crafted by everyday users with nothing more than cleverly worded
prompts. This paper presents a systems-style investigation into how non-experts
reliably circumvent safety mechanisms through techniques such as multi-turn
narrative escalation, lexical camouflage, implication chaining, fictional
impersonation, and subtle semantic edits. We propose a unified taxonomy of
prompt-level jailbreak strategies spanning both text-output and T2I models,
grounded in empirical case studies across popular APIs. Our analysis reveals
that every stage of the moderation pipeline, from input filtering to output
validation, can be bypassed with accessible strategies. We conclude by
highlighting the urgent need for context-aware defenses that reflect the ease
with which these jailbreaks can be reproduced in real-world settings.

Result: 在CIFAR-100和ImageNet-1k上优于OFA方法，参数开销更小。

Conclusion: 该方法简单高效，可作为跨架构知识蒸馏的强基线。

Abstract: We describe a simple method for cross-architecture knowledge distillation,
where the knowledge transfer is cast into a redundant information suppression
formulation. Existing methods introduce sophisticated modules,
architecture-tailored designs, and excessive parameters, which impair their
efficiency and applicability. We propose to extract the architecture-agnostic
knowledge in heterogeneous representations by reducing the redundant
architecture-exclusive information. To this end, we present a simple redundancy
suppression distillation (RSD) loss, which comprises cross-architecture
invariance maximisation and feature decorrelation objectives. To prevent the
student from entirely losing its architecture-specific capabilities, we further
design a lightweight module that decouples the RSD objective from the student's
internal representations. Our method is devoid of the architecture-specific
designs and complex operations in the pioneering method of OFA. It outperforms
OFA on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k benchmarks with only a fraction of their
parameter overhead, which highlights its potential as a simple and strong
baseline to the cross-architecture distillation community.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种选择性跨模态融合框架（SMFNet），用于RGB-D视频显著性目标检测（VSOD），通过像素级选择性融合策略（PSF）和多维选择性注意力模块（MSAM）优化运动与深度信息的利用，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RGB-D VSOD模型在利用运动（光流）和深度信息时未考虑其在不同场景中的贡献差异，限制了性能提升。

Method: 提出SMFNet框架，包含PSF策略（选择性融合光流和深度）和MSAM模块（多维特征增强）。

Result: 在RDVS和DVisal数据集上全面评估，SMFNet优于19种先进模型，并在合成深度视频数据集上验证了有效性。

Conclusion: SMFNet通过选择性融合和多维注意力机制，显著提升了RGB-D VSOD任务的性能，为未来研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Applying salient object detection (SOD) to RGB-D videos is an emerging task
called RGB-D VSOD and has recently gained increasing interest, due to
considerable performance gains of incorporating motion and depth and that RGB-D
videos can be easily captured now in daily life. Existing RGB-D VSOD models
have different attempts to derive motion cues, in which extracting motion
information explicitly from optical flow appears to be a more effective and
promising alternative. Despite this, there remains a key issue that how to
effectively utilize optical flow and depth to assist the RGB modality in SOD.
Previous methods always treat optical flow and depth equally with respect to
model designs, without explicitly considering their unequal contributions in
individual scenarios, limiting the potential of motion and depth. To address
this issue and unleash the power of motion and depth, we propose a novel
selective cross-modal fusion framework (SMFNet) for RGB-D VSOD, incorporating a
pixel-level selective fusion strategy (PSF) that achieves optimal fusion of
optical flow and depth based on their actual contributions. Besides, we propose
a multi-dimensional selective attention module (MSAM) to integrate the fused
features derived from PSF with the remaining RGB modality at multiple
dimensions, effectively enhancing feature representation to generate refined
features. We conduct comprehensive evaluation of SMFNet against 19
state-of-the-art models on both RDVS and DVisal datasets, making the evaluation
the most comprehensive RGB-D VSOD benchmark up to date, and it also
demonstrates the superiority of SMFNet over other models. Meanwhile, evaluation
on five video benchmark datasets incorporating synthetic depth validates the
efficacy of SMFNet as well. Our code and benchmark results are made publicly
available at https://github.com/Jia-hao999/SMFNet.

Conclusion: Vid-TTA为现有视频编辑模型提供了即插即用的性能提升。

Abstract: Video editing is a critical component of content creation that transforms raw
footage into coherent works aligned with specific visual and narrative
objectives. Existing approaches face two major challenges: temporal
inconsistencies due to failure in capturing complex motion patterns, and
overfitting to simple prompts arising from limitations in UNet backbone
architectures. While learning-based methods can enhance editing quality, they
typically demand substantial computational resources and are constrained by the
scarcity of high-quality annotated data. In this paper, we present Vid-TTA, a
lightweight test-time adaptation framework that personalizes optimization for
each test video during inference through self-supervised auxiliary tasks. Our
approach incorporates a motion-aware frame reconstruction mechanism that
identifies and preserves crucial movement regions, alongside a prompt
perturbation and reconstruction strategy that strengthens model robustness to
diverse textual descriptions. These innovations are orchestrated by a
meta-learning driven dynamic loss balancing mechanism that adaptively adjusts
the optimization process based on video characteristics. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Vid-TTA significantly improves video temporal consistency and
mitigates prompt overfitting while maintaining low computational overhead,
offering a plug-and-play performance boost for existing video editing models.

Result: 在YouRefIt数据集上，0.25 IoU阈值下性能提升约4 mAP。

Conclusion: 双模型框架和多模态集成有效提升了指向性参考理解的准确性。

Abstract: We address the problem of Embodied Reference Understanding, which involves
predicting the object that a person in the scene is referring to through both
pointing gesture and language. Accurately identifying the referent requires
multimodal understanding: integrating textual instructions, visual pointing,
and scene context. However, existing methods often struggle to effectively
leverage visual clues for disambiguation. We also observe that, while the
referent is often aligned with the head-to-fingertip line, it occasionally
aligns more closely with the wrist-to-fingertip line. Therefore, relying on a
single line assumption can be overly simplistic and may lead to suboptimal
performance. To address this, we propose a dual-model framework, where one
model learns from the head-to-fingertip direction and the other from the
wrist-to-fingertip direction. We further introduce a Gaussian ray heatmap
representation of these lines and use them as input to provide a strong
supervisory signal that encourages the model to better attend to pointing cues.
To combine the strengths of both models, we present the CLIP-Aware Pointing
Ensemble module, which performs a hybrid ensemble based on CLIP features.
Additionally, we propose an object center prediction head as an auxiliary task
to further enhance referent localization. We validate our approach through
extensive experiments and analysis on the benchmark YouRefIt dataset, achieving
an improvement of approximately 4 mAP at the 0.25 IoU threshold.

Method: 系统包含Narrator（生成文本和多模态提示）、Director（动态场景图管理）、Narrative Arc Controller（高层故事结构指导）和Affective Tone Mapper（跨模态情感一致性）。

Result: 在多样化的叙事提示上，Aether Weaver在叙事深度、视觉保真度和情感共鸣方面优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为快速创意原型设计和沉浸式叙事体验提供了强大平台。

Abstract: We introduce Aether Weaver, a novel, integrated framework for multimodal
narrative co-generation that overcomes limitations of sequential text-to-visual
pipelines. Our system concurrently synthesizes textual narratives, dynamic
scene graph representations, visual scenes, and affective soundscapes, driven
by a tightly integrated, co-generation mechanism. At its core, the Narrator, a
large language model, generates narrative text and multimodal prompts, while
the Director acts as a dynamic scene graph manager, and analyzes the text to
build and maintain a structured representation of the story's world, ensuring
spatio-temporal and relational consistency for visual rendering and subsequent
narrative generation. Additionally, a Narrative Arc Controller guides the
high-level story structure, influencing multimodal affective consistency,
further complemented by an Affective Tone Mapper that ensures congruent
emotional expression across all modalities. Through qualitative evaluations on
a diverse set of narrative prompts encompassing various genres, we demonstrate
that Aether Weaver significantly enhances narrative depth, visual fidelity, and
emotional resonance compared to cascaded baseline approaches. This integrated
framework provides a robust platform for rapid creative prototyping and
immersive storytelling experiences.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度伪造技术对数字媒体真实性构成威胁，现有检测器在真实场景中的有效性尚未验证。

Method: 提出一种模拟真实场景的测试方法，使用先进生成技术创建包含50万张高质量深度伪造图像的数据集。

Result: 检测深度伪造仍具挑战性，不到一半的检测器AUC超过60%，最低为50%。图像处理会显著降低性能。

Conclusion: 深度伪造检测仍需改进，公开代码和数据以促进研究。

Abstract: Deepfakes powered by advanced machine learning models present a significant
and evolving threat to identity verification and the authenticity of digital
media. Although numerous detectors have been developed to address this problem,
their effectiveness has yet to be tested when applied to real-world data. In
this work we evaluate modern deepfake detectors, introducing a novel testing
procedure designed to mimic real-world scenarios for deepfake detection. Using
state-of-the-art deepfake generation methods, we create a comprehensive dataset
containing more than 500,000 high-quality deepfake images. Our analysis shows
that detecting deepfakes still remains a challenging task. The evaluation shows
that in fewer than half of the deepfake detectors tested achieved an AUC score
greater than 60%, with the lowest being 50%. We demonstrate that basic image
manipulations, such as JPEG compression or image enhancement, can significantly
reduce model performance. All code and data are publicly available at

Motivation: 探讨AI在计算病理学中是否可能学习到与健康社会决定因素相关的非预期人口统计偏差。

Method: 使用多站点数据集，应用注意力机制揭示与种族相关的形态特征，并评估三种数据筛选策略。

Result: 模型对白人和黑人群体预测性能较高（AUC: 0.799, 0.762），整体性能降至0.663；表皮是关键预测特征。

Conclusion: 研究强调在病理学中公平部署AI需要谨慎的数据筛选和偏见缓解措施。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has demonstrated success in computational
pathology (CPath) for disease detection, biomarker classification, and
prognosis prediction. However, its potential to learn unintended demographic
biases, particularly those related to social determinants of health, remains
understudied. This study investigates whether deep learning models can predict
self-reported race from digitized dermatopathology slides and identifies
potential morphological shortcuts. Using a multisite dataset with a racially
diverse population, we apply an attention-based mechanism to uncover
race-associated morphological features. After evaluating three dataset curation
strategies to control for confounding factors, the final experiment showed that
White and Black demographic groups retained high prediction performance (AUC:
0.799, 0.762), while overall performance dropped to 0.663. Attention analysis
revealed the epidermis as a key predictive feature, with significant
performance declines when these regions were removed. These findings highlight
the need for careful data curation and bias mitigation to ensure equitable AI
deployment in pathology. Code available at:

TL;DR: ArtSeek是一个多模态框架，结合了大型语言模型和检索增强生成技术，用于艺术品分析，仅需图像输入，无需依赖外部知识库链接。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字化艺术品分析需要视觉解读和丰富的艺术、历史知识，现有方法依赖外部知识库链接，限制了适用性。

Method: ArtSeek包含多模态检索模块、对比多任务分类网络和基于上下文的推理策略，利用WikiFragments数据集支持知识推理。

Result: 在风格分类和描述任务上表现优异，分别提升8.4% F1和7.1 BLEU@1。

Conclusion: ArtSeek能有效解读视觉主题和历史背景，适用于其他需要外部知识的领域，代码和数据集将公开。

Abstract: Analyzing digitized artworks presents unique challenges, requiring not only
visual interpretation but also a deep understanding of rich artistic,
contextual, and historical knowledge. We introduce ArtSeek, a multimodal
framework for art analysis that combines multimodal large language models with
retrieval-augmented generation. Unlike prior work, our pipeline relies only on
image input, enabling applicability to artworks without links to Wikidata or
Wikipedia-common in most digitized collections. ArtSeek integrates three key
components: an intelligent multimodal retrieval module based on late
interaction retrieval, a contrastive multitask classification network for
predicting artist, genre, style, media, and tags, and an agentic reasoning
strategy enabled through in-context examples for complex visual question
answering and artwork explanation via Qwen2.5-VL. Central to this approach is
WikiFragments, a Wikipedia-scale dataset of image-text fragments curated to
support knowledge-grounded multimodal reasoning. Our framework achieves
state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks, including a +8.4% F1
improvement in style classification over GraphCLIP and a +7.1 BLEU@1 gain in
captioning on ArtPedia. Qualitative analyses show that ArtSeek can interpret
visual motifs, infer historical context, and retrieve relevant knowledge, even
for obscure works. Though focused on visual arts, our approach generalizes to
other domains requiring external knowledge, supporting scalable multimodal AI
research. Both the dataset and the source code will be made publicly available

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Transformer的模型SwinECAT，结合Swin Attention和ECA Attention，用于眼底图像的多类别分类，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决眼底图像分析中因小病灶区域和疾病间细微差异导致的模型预测精度下降和过拟合问题。

Method: 结合Swin Attention和ECA Attention机制，SwinECAT模型有效捕捉局部空间结构和长程依赖关系，同时关注关键特征通道。

Result: 在9类别分类任务中，SwinECAT达到88.29%的准确率，加权F1分数0.88，宏观F1分数0.90，显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: SwinECAT在眼底疾病分类任务中表现出色，为多类别分类提供了高性能解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, artificial intelligence has been increasingly applied in the
field of medical imaging. Among these applications, fundus image analysis
presents special challenges, including small lesion areas in certain fundus
diseases and subtle inter-disease differences, which can lead to reduced
prediction accuracy and overfitting in the models. To address these challenges,
this paper proposes the Transformer-based model SwinECAT, which combines the
Shifted Window (Swin) Attention with the Efficient Channel Attention (ECA)
Attention. SwinECAT leverages the Swin Attention mechanism in the Swin
Transformer backbone to effectively capture local spatial structures and
long-range dependencies within fundus images. The lightweight ECA mechanism is
incorporated to guide the SwinECAT's attention toward critical feature
channels, enabling more discriminative feature representation. In contrast to
previous studies that typically classify fundus images into 4 to 6 categories,
this work expands fundus disease classification to 9 distinct types, thereby
enhancing the granularity of diagnosis. We evaluate our method on the Eye
Disease Image Dataset (EDID) containing 16,140 fundus images for 9-category
classification. Experimental results demonstrate that SwinECAT achieves 88.29\%
accuracy, with weighted F1-score of 0.88 and macro F1-score of 0.90. The
classification results of our proposed model SwinECAT significantly outperform
the baseline Swin Transformer and multiple compared baseline models. To our
knowledge, this represents the highest reported performance for 9-category
classification on this public dataset.

TL;DR: MMAT-1M是首个百万规模的多模态代理调优数据集，支持链式思维、反思和动态工具使用，显著提升了多模态大语言模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态领域缺乏大规模高质量的代理调优数据集，限制了多模态大语言模型的潜力。

Method: 通过四阶段数据引擎构建MMAT-1M数据集：1) 收集公开多模态数据集；2) 利用GPT-4生成理性解释并整合API调用和RAG；3) 通过反思优化理性；4) 可选压缩为单轮格式。

Result: InternVL2.5-8B-RR模型在八个公共基准上平均提升2.7%，在Dyn-VQA上提升8.8%。

Conclusion: MMAT-1M有效提升了多模态推理和工具使用能力，数据集已公开。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), enhanced through agent tuning, have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and tool
utilization, significantly surpassing the performance of standalone models.
However, the multimodal domain still lacks a large-scale, high-quality agent
tuning dataset to unlock the full potential of multimodal large language
models. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMAT-1M, the first million-scale
multimodal agent tuning dataset designed to support CoT, reflection, and
dynamic tool usage. Our dataset is constructed through a novel four-stage data
engine: 1) We first curate publicly available multimodal datasets containing
question-answer pairs; 2) Then, leveraging GPT-4o, we generate rationales for
the original question-answer pairs and dynamically integrate API calls and
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) information through a multi-turn paradigm;
3) Furthermore, we refine the rationales through reflection to ensure logical
consistency and accuracy, creating a multi-turn dialogue dataset with both
Rationale and Reflection (RR); 4) Finally, to enhance efficiency, we optionally
compress multi-turn dialogues into a One-turn Rationale and Reflection (ORR)
format. By fine-tuning open-source multimodal models on the MMAT-1M, we observe
significant performance gains. For instance, the InternVL2.5-8B-RR model
achieves an average improvement of 2.7% across eight public benchmarks and 8.8%
on the RAG benchmark Dyn-VQA, demonstrating the dataset's effectiveness in
enhancing multimodal reasoning and tool-based capabilities. The dataset is
publicly available at https://github.com/VIS-MPU-Agent/MMAT-1M.

TL;DR: LMAC-Net提出了一种多模态注意力一致性机制，用于长期动作质量评估，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法有效建模多模态线索（如音乐）或忽视跨模态协作和时间动态，导致评估不准确。

Method: LMAC-Net通过多模态注意力一致性机制对齐视觉和音频特征，引入局部查询编码模块和两级评分机制。

Result: 在RG和Fis-V数据集上，LMAC-Net表现显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LMAC-Net通过多模态对齐和优化，提升了长期动作质量评估的准确性。

Abstract: Long-term action quality assessment (AQA) focuses on evaluating the quality
of human activities in videos lasting up to several minutes. This task plays an
important role in the automated evaluation of artistic sports such as rhythmic
gymnastics and figure skating, where both accurate motion execution and
temporal synchronization with background music are essential for performance
assessment. However, existing methods predominantly fall into two categories:
unimodal approaches that rely solely on visual features, which are inadequate
for modeling multimodal cues like music; and multimodal approaches that
typically employ simple feature-level contrastive fusion, overlooking deep
cross-modal collaboration and temporal dynamics. As a result, they struggle to
capture complex interactions between modalities and fail to accurately track
critical performance changes throughout extended sequences. To address these
challenges, we propose the Long-term Multimodal Attention Consistency Network
(LMAC-Net). LMAC-Net introduces a multimodal attention consistency mechanism to
explicitly align multimodal features, enabling stable integration of visual and
audio information and enhancing feature representations. Specifically, we
introduce a multimodal local query encoder module to capture temporal semantics
and cross-modal relations, and use a two-level score evaluation for
interpretable results. In addition, attention-based and regression-based losses
are applied to jointly optimize multimodal alignment and score fusion.
Experiments conducted on the RG and Fis-V datasets demonstrate that LMAC-Net
significantly outperforms existing methods, validating the effectiveness of our
proposed approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于mixup-class prompt的文本提示策略，用于生成多样且鲁棒的合成数据，提升后训练量化（PTQ）的泛化能力和优化稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决数据自由量化（DFQ）中合成图像与量化模型泛化性关系未充分探索的问题，避免单类提示生成的合成图像因多义性导致性能下降。

Method: 采用mixup-based文本提示策略，融合多个类别标签生成合成数据，并通过梯度范数和泛化误差分析提供定量见解。

Result: 在CNN和ViT上的实验表明，该方法优于现有DFQ方法（如GenQ），并在极低位量化（如W2A4）中达到新SOTA准确率。

Conclusion: mixup-class prompt策略有效提升了PTQ的泛化性和稳定性，尤其在低位量化场景中表现突出。

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) improves efficiency but struggles with
limited calibration data, especially under privacy constraints. Data-free
quantization (DFQ) mitigates this by generating synthetic images using
generative models such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) and
text-conditioned latent diffusion models (LDMs), while applying existing PTQ
algorithms. However, the relationship between generated synthetic images and
the generalizability of the quantized model during PTQ remains underexplored.
Without investigating this relationship, synthetic images generated by previous
prompt engineering methods based on single-class prompts suffer from issues
such as polysemy, leading to performance degradation. We propose
\textbf{mixup-class prompt}, a mixup-based text prompting strategy that fuses
multiple class labels at the text prompt level to generate diverse, robust
synthetic data. This approach enhances generalization, and improves
optimization stability in PTQ. We provide quantitative insights through
gradient norm and generalization error analysis. Experiments on convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) show that our method
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art DFQ methods like GenQ. Furthermore,
it pushes the performance boundary in extremely low-bit scenarios, achieving
new state-of-the-art accuracy in challenging 2-bit weight, 4-bit activation
(W2A4) quantization.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需阴影掩码的阴影去除方法，通过自适应门控双分支注意力机制和扩散式频率-对比融合网络，有效分离阴影特征并恢复细节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖阴影掩码，但在实际场景中难以获取；局部对比信息虽可作为替代，但在复杂场景中易受干扰。

Method: 采用自适应门控双分支注意力（AGBA）机制动态过滤对比信息，并结合扩散式频率-对比融合网络（FCFN）恢复细节。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在无掩码方法中达到最优，且与依赖掩码的方法性能相当。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了无掩码阴影去除的挑战，并在复杂场景中表现优异。

Abstract: Existing shadow removal methods often rely on shadow masks, which are
challenging to acquire in real-world scenarios. Exploring intrinsic image cues,
such as local contrast information, presents a potential alternative for
guiding shadow removal in the absence of explicit masks. However, the cue's
inherent ambiguity becomes a critical limitation in complex scenes, where it
can fail to distinguish true shadows from low-reflectance objects and intricate
background textures. To address this motivation, we propose the Adaptive Gated
Dual-Branch Attention (AGBA) mechanism. AGBA dynamically filters and re-weighs
the contrast prior to effectively disentangle shadow features from confounding
visual elements. Furthermore, to tackle the persistent challenge of restoring
soft shadow boundaries and fine-grained details, we introduce a diffusion-based
Frequency-Contrast Fusion Network (FCFN) that leverages high-frequency and
contrast cues to guide the generative process. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results among mask-free
approaches while maintaining competitive performance relative to mask-based
methods.

Result: 提出的框架直接针对共现问题，无需外部监督，改善了伪掩码的覆盖率和准确性。

Conclusion: 新方法有效解决了弱监督语义分割中的共现偏差问题，提升了在工业烟雾等领域的适用性。

Abstract: Scarcity of pixel-level labels is a significant challenge in practical
scenarios. In specific domains like industrial smoke, acquiring such detailed
annotations is particularly difficult and often requires expert knowledge. To
alleviate this, weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) has emerged as a
promising approach. However, due to the supervision gap and inherent bias in
models trained with only image level labels, existing WSSS methods suffer from
limitations such as incomplete foreground coverage, inaccurate object
boundaries, and spurious correlations, especially in our domain, where
emissions are always spatially coupled with chimneys.
  Previous solutions typically rely on additional priors or external knowledge
to mitigate these issues, but they often lack scalability and fail to address
the model's inherent bias toward co-occurring context. To address this, we
propose a novel WSSS framework that directly targets the co-occurrence problem
without relying on external supervision. Unlike prior methods that adopt a
single network, we employ a teacher-student framework that combines CNNs and
ViTs. We introduce a knowledge transfer loss that enforces cross-architecture
consistency by aligning internal representations. Additionally, we incorporate
post-processing techniques to address partial coverage and further improve
pseudo mask quality.

Abstract: Wide-baseline panorama reconstruction has emerged as a highly effective and
pivotal approach for not only achieving geometric reconstruction of the
surrounding 3D environment, but also generating highly realistic and immersive
novel views. Although existing methods have shown remarkable performance across
various benchmarks, they are predominantly reliant on accurate pose
information. In real-world scenarios, the acquisition of precise pose often
requires additional computational resources and is highly susceptible to noise.
These limitations hinder the broad applicability and practicality of such
methods. In this paper, we present PanoSplatt3R, an unposed wide-baseline
panorama reconstruction method. We extend and adapt the foundational
reconstruction pretrainings from the perspective domain to the panoramic
domain, thus enabling powerful generalization capabilities. To ensure a
seamless and efficient domain-transfer process, we introduce RoPE rolling that
spans rolled coordinates in rotary positional embeddings across different
attention heads, maintaining a minimal modification to RoPE's mechanism, while
modeling the horizontal periodicity of panorama images. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that PanoSplatt3R, even in the absence of pose
information, significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. This
superiority is evident in both the generation of high-quality novel views and
the accuracy of depth estimation, thereby showcasing its great potential for
practical applications. Project page: https://npucvr.github.io/PanoSplatt3R

Conclusion: 该方法有望成为临床工作流程中自动化心电图解读的实用工具。

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading global cause of death, and
early detection is essential to improve patient outcomes. Electrocardiograms
(ECGs), especially 12-lead ECGs, play a key role in the identification of CVDs.
These are routinely interpreted by human experts, a process that is
time-consuming and requires expert knowledge. Historical research in this area
has focused on automatic ECG interpretation from digital signals, with recent
deep learning approaches achieving strong results. In practice, however, most
ECG data in clinical practice are stored or shared in image form. To bridge
this gap, we propose a deep learning framework designed specifically to
classify paper-like ECG images into five main diagnostic categories. Our method
was the winning entry to the 2024 British Heart Foundation Open Data Science
Challenge. It addresses two main challenges of paper ECG classification: visual
noise (e.g., shadows or creases) and the need to detect fine-detailed waveform
patterns. We propose a pre-processing pipeline that reduces visual noise and a
two-stage fine-tuning strategy: the model is first fine-tuned on synthetic and
external ECG image datasets to learn domain-specific features, and then further
fine-tuned on the target dataset to enhance disease-specific recognition. We
adopt the ConvNeXt architecture as the backbone of our model. Our method
achieved AUROC scores of 0.9688 on the public validation set and 0.9677 on the
private test set of the British Heart Foundation Open Data Science Challenge,
highlighting its potential as a practical tool for automated ECG interpretation
in clinical workflows.

Motivation: 事件相机具有高动态范围和精细时间分辨率，但稀疏噪声事件流与密集图像数据的融合是挑战。

Method: 提出EIFNet，包含自适应事件特征优化模块（AEFRM）、模态自适应重校准模块（MARM）和多头注意力门控融合模块（MGFM）。

Result: 在DDD17-Semantic和DSEC-Semantic数据集上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: EIFNet有效解决了事件语义分割中的特征提取和跨模态融合问题。

Abstract: Event-based semantic segmentation explores the potential of event cameras,
which offer high dynamic range and fine temporal resolution, to achieve robust
scene understanding in challenging environments. Despite these advantages, the
task remains difficult due to two main challenges: extracting reliable features
from sparse and noisy event streams, and effectively fusing them with dense,
semantically rich image data that differ in structure and representation. To
address these issues, we propose EIFNet, a multi-modal fusion network that
combines the strengths of both event and frame-based inputs. The network
includes an Adaptive Event Feature Refinement Module (AEFRM), which improves
event representations through multi-scale activity modeling and spatial
attention. In addition, we introduce a Modality-Adaptive Recalibration Module
(MARM) and a Multi-Head Attention Gated Fusion Module (MGFM), which align and
integrate features across modalities using attention mechanisms and gated
fusion strategies. Experiments on DDD17-Semantic and DSEC-Semantic datasets
show that EIFNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating its
effectiveness in event-based semantic segmentation.

Motivation: 现有CLIP模型在处理非英语数据时缺乏有效的数据筛选方法，且多语言性能下降（即“多语言诅咒”）。

Method: 通过最小化调整，提出了一种从全球网络数据训练CLIP的配方，实现了英语和非英语数据的互利。

Result: 在零样本ImageNet分类中，MetaCLIP 2 ViT-H/14超越了其英语版本0.8%，并在多语言基准测试中创下新纪录。

Conclusion: MetaCLIP 2成功解决了多语言数据训练的挑战，显著提升了CLIP在多语言任务中的性能。

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) is a popular foundation model,
supporting from zero-shot classification, retrieval to encoders for multimodal
large language models (MLLMs). Although CLIP is successfully trained on
billion-scale image-text pairs from the English world, scaling CLIP's training
further to learning from the worldwide web data is still challenging: (1) no
curation method is available to handle data points from non-English world; (2)
the English performance from existing multilingual CLIP is worse than its
English-only counterpart, i.e., "curse of multilinguality" that is common in
LLMs. Here, we present MetaCLIP 2, the first recipe training CLIP from scratch
on worldwide web-scale image-text pairs. To generalize our findings, we conduct
rigorous ablations with minimal changes that are necessary to address the above
challenges and present a recipe enabling mutual benefits from English and
non-English world data. In zero-shot ImageNet classification, MetaCLIP 2
ViT-H/14 surpasses its English-only counterpart by 0.8% and mSigLIP by 0.7%,
and surprisingly sets new state-of-the-art without system-level confounding
factors (e.g., translation, bespoke architecture changes) on multilingual

Conclusion: 显式建模细微运动线索对微动作识别至关重要。

Abstract: Micro-Actions (MAs) are an important form of non-verbal communication in
social interactions, with potential applications in human emotional analysis.
However, existing methods in Micro-Action Recognition often overlook the
inherent subtle changes in MAs, which limits the accuracy of distinguishing MAs
with subtle changes. To address this issue, we present a novel Motion-guided
Modulation Network (MMN) that implicitly captures and modulates subtle motion
cues to enhance spatial-temporal representation learning. Specifically, we
introduce a Motion-guided Skeletal Modulation module (MSM) to inject motion
cues at the skeletal level, acting as a control signal to guide spatial
representation modeling. In parallel, we design a Motion-guided Temporal
Modulation module (MTM) to incorporate motion information at the frame level,
facilitating the modeling of holistic motion patterns in micro-actions.
Finally, we propose a motion consistency learning strategy to aggregate the
motion cues from multi-scale features for micro-action classification.
Experimental results on the Micro-Action 52 and iMiGUE datasets demonstrate
that MMN achieves state-of-the-art performance in skeleton-based micro-action
recognition, underscoring the importance of explicitly modeling subtle motion
cues. The code will be available at https://github.com/momiji-bit/MMN.

TL;DR: ZIUM是一种针对机器遗忘模型的零样本意图感知对抗攻击方法，能够高效生成符合攻击者意图的内容，并显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器遗忘模型存在被对抗提示攻击的风险，现有方法在生成符合意图的内容和计算成本方面存在不足。

Method: 提出ZIUM方法，支持零样本对抗攻击，无需额外优化即可针对遗忘概念生成攻击内容。

Result: ZIUM在多种机器遗忘场景中表现出色，攻击成功率高且显著减少攻击时间。

Conclusion: ZIUM为机器遗忘模型的安全提供了高效解决方案，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) removes specific data points or concepts from deep
learning models to enhance privacy and prevent sensitive content generation.
Adversarial prompts can exploit unlearned models to generate content containing
removed concepts, posing a significant security risk. However, existing
adversarial attack methods still face challenges in generating content that
aligns with an attacker's intent while incurring high computational costs to
identify successful prompts. To address these challenges, we propose ZIUM, a
Zero-shot Intent-aware adversarial attack on Unlearned Models, which enables
the flexible customization of target attack images to reflect an attacker's
intent. Additionally, ZIUM supports zero-shot adversarial attacks without
requiring further optimization for previously attacked unlearned concepts. The
evaluation across various MU scenarios demonstrated ZIUM's effectiveness in
successfully customizing content based on user-intent prompts while achieving a
superior attack success rate compared to existing methods. Moreover, its
zero-shot adversarial attack significantly reduces the attack time for
previously attacked unlearned concepts.

*Oliver J. Sutton,Qinghua Zhou,George Leete,Alexander N. Gorban,Ivan Y. Tyukin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的方法来标记和锁定计算机视觉模型，以保护知识产权，无需微调或重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 保护模型所有者的知识产权，防止未经授权的使用。

Method: 通过直接修改少量模型权重实现标记和锁定，锁定模型需在输入图像中插入触发补丁解锁。

Result: 实验证明方法有效，对模型性能影响最小。

Conclusion: 该方法为模型保护提供了可证明且计算可行的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce new methods of staining and locking computer vision models, to
protect their owners' intellectual property. Staining, also known as
watermarking, embeds secret behaviour into a model which can later be used to
identify it, while locking aims to make a model unusable unless a secret
trigger is inserted into input images. Unlike existing methods, our algorithms
can be used to stain and lock pre-trained models without requiring fine-tuning
or retraining, and come with provable, computable guarantees bounding their
worst-case false positive rates. The stain and lock are implemented by directly
modifying a small number of the model's weights and have minimal impact on the
(unlocked) model's performance. Locked models are unlocked by inserting a small
`trigger patch' into the corner of the input image. We present experimental
results showing the efficacy of our methods and demonstrating their practical
performance on a variety of computer vision models.

TL;DR: CEDANet是一种结合人类参与和领域适应的框架，用于工业烟雾分割，利用弱标签和对抗特征对齐，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决工业烟雾分割中像素级标注成本高和数据稀缺的问题。

Method: 通过公民提供的视频级标签和对抗特征对齐，优化伪标签并迁移源域表示。

Result: 在SMOKE5K和IJmond数据集上，F1分数和IoU显著提升，接近全监督模型性能。

Conclusion: 结合公民科学和弱监督领域适应，为数据稀缺的环境监测提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Industrial smoke segmentation is critical for air-quality monitoring and
environmental protection but is often hampered by the high cost and scarcity of
pixel-level annotations in real-world settings. We introduce CEDANet, a
human-in-the-loop, class-aware domain adaptation framework that uniquely
integrates weak, citizen-provided video-level labels with adversarial feature
alignment. Specifically, we refine pseudo-labels generated by a source-trained
segmentation model using citizen votes, and employ class-specific domain
discriminators to transfer rich source-domain representations to the industrial
domain. Comprehensive experiments on SMOKE5K and custom IJmond datasets
demonstrate that CEDANet achieves an F1-score of 0.414 and a smoke-class IoU of
0.261 with citizen feedback, vastly outperforming the baseline model, which
scored 0.083 and 0.043 respectively. This represents a five-fold increase in
F1-score and a six-fold increase in smoke-class IoU. Notably, CEDANet with
citizen-constrained pseudo-labels achieves performance comparable to the same
architecture trained on limited 100 fully annotated images with F1-score of
0.418 and IoU of 0.264, demonstrating its ability to reach small-sampled fully
supervised-level accuracy without target-domain annotations. Our research
validates the scalability and cost-efficiency of combining citizen science with
weakly supervised domain adaptation, offering a practical solution for complex,
data-scarce environmental monitoring applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs在视觉理解和多模态推理方面表现出色，但常出现幻觉现象，现有方法多为文本中心，视觉语义对齐效果有限。

Method: ViHallu通过生成视觉变化图像和构建视觉指令，增强LVLMs对细粒度视觉内容的理解，改善视觉语义对齐。

Conclusion: ViHallu有效缓解LVLMs的幻觉问题，提升视觉语义对齐，为相关研究提供新工具和数据支持。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in visual understanding and multimodal reasoning. However, LVLMs
frequently exhibit hallucination phenomena, manifesting as the generated
textual responses that demonstrate inconsistencies with the provided visual
content. Existing hallucination mitigation methods are predominantly
text-centric, the challenges of visual-semantic alignment significantly limit
their effectiveness, especially when confronted with fine-grained visual
understanding scenarios. To this end, this paper presents ViHallu, a
Vision-Centric Hallucination mitigation framework that enhances visual-semantic
alignment through Visual Variation Image Generation and Visual Instruction
Construction. ViHallu introduces \textbf{\textit{visual variation images}} with
controllable visual alterations while maintaining the overall image structure.
These images, combined with carefully constructed visual instructions, enable
LVLMs to better understand fine-grained visual content through fine-tuning,
allowing models to more precisely capture the correspondence between visual
content and text, thereby enhancing visual-semantic alignment. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmarks show that ViHallu effectively enhances
models' fine-grained visual understanding while significantly reducing
hallucination tendencies. Furthermore, we release ViHallu-Instruction, a visual
instruction dataset specifically designed for hallucination mitigation and
visual-semantic alignment. Code is available at

Motivation: 验证密集音频-视觉模型在低资源、多语言和噪声环境中的有效性，尤其是在发展中国家常见的复杂语言环境中。

Method: 比较了三种对比目标函数：全局平均池化损失、密集最大-平均令牌匹配器和混合方法，使用多语言数据集Project Vaani进行测试。

Result: 密集目标函数在音频-视觉检索中相对全局池化提升了59%的R@1，并显著降低了平均/中位数排名，同时能生成清晰的零样本定位热图。

Conclusion: 密集令牌路由在低资源环境中更具决定性，尤其是在标注和音频质量较差的情况下。

Abstract: Recent dense audio-visual (AV) models achieve impressive retrieval and
emergent localization, but almost all evidence comes from English-centric,
caption-rich web video. It is unclear whether these objectives survive in
low-resource, code-switched, and noisy multilingual settings that typify
developing regions. We show they do**-**and that the choice of aggregation
function becomes even more critical. Using a multilingual subset of Project
Vaani spanning dozens of Indian languages and dialectal variants, we compare
three contrastive objectives: (i) a global mean-pooled loss (CLIP-style), (ii)
a dense max-mean token matcher (DenseAV-style), and (iii) a simple hybrid
(motivated by frozen-vision alignment strategies). The dense objective delivers
a +59% relative R@1 (Audio Visual) improvement over global pooling and
substantially lower mean/median ranks, while consistently producing sharp
zero-shot localization heatmaps of spoken objects-despite keeping the vision
backbone entirely frozen (no LoRA / partial fine-tuning). Our results
demonstrate that dense token routing is not a luxury of high-resource English
corpora; it is more decisive when annotations and acoustic cleanliness are
scarce. We release the codebase and trained models.

Abstract: We propose a novel segmentation-based explainable artificial intelligence
(XAI) method for neural networks working on point cloud classification. As one
building block of this method, we propose a novel point-shifting mechanism to
introduce perturbations in point cloud data. Recently, AI has seen an
exponential growth. Hence, it is important to understand the decision-making
process of AI algorithms when they are applied in critical areas. Our work
focuses on explaining AI algorithms that classify point cloud data. An
important aspect of the methods used for explaining AI algorithms is their
ability to produce explanations that are easy for humans to understand. This
allows them to analyze the AI algorithms better and make appropriate decisions
based on that analysis. Therefore, in this work, we intend to generate
meaningful explanations that can be easily interpreted by humans. The point
cloud data we consider represents 3D objects such as cars, guitars, and
laptops. We make use of point cloud segmentation models to generate
explanations for the working of classification models. The segments are used to
introduce perturbations into the input point cloud data and generate saliency
maps. The perturbations are introduced using the novel point-shifting mechanism
proposed in this work which ensures that the shifted points no longer influence
the output of the classification algorithm. In contrast to previous methods,
the segments used by our method are meaningful, i.e. humans can easily
interpret the meaning of the segments. Thus, the benefit of our method over
other methods is its ability to produce more meaningful saliency maps. We
compare our method with the use of classical clustering algorithms to generate
explanations. We also analyze the saliency maps generated for example inputs
using our method to demonstrate the usefulness of the method in generating
meaningful explanations.

Motivation: 研究浅层网络在少样本学习中的潜力，挑战主流深度网络的偏好，探索浅层网络是否能够达到或超越深度网络的性能。

Method: 提出LCN-4网络，包含位置感知特征聚类模块，采用网格位置编码补偿和频域位置嵌入技术，解决特征提取中的位置信息丢失问题。

Result: 在三个细粒度少样本基准测试中，LCN-4显著优于基于ConvNet-4的现有方法，性能与多数基于ResNet12的方法相当或更优。

Conclusion: 浅层网络在少样本学习中具有潜力，LCN-4的成功验证了其性能优势，为网络设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Deep learning has witnessed the extensive utilization across a wide spectrum
of domains, including fine-grained few-shot learning (FGFSL) which heavily
depends on deep backbones. Nonetheless, shallower deep backbones such as
ConvNet-4, are not commonly preferred because they're prone to extract a larger
quantity of non-abstract visual attributes. In this paper, we initially
re-evaluate the relationship between network depth and the ability to fully
encode few-shot instances, and delve into whether shallow deep architecture
could effectuate comparable or superior performance to mainstream deep
backbone. Fueled by the inspiration from vanilla ConvNet-4, we introduce a
location-aware constellation network (LCN-4), equipped with a cutting-edge
location-aware feature clustering module. This module can proficiently encoder
and integrate spatial feature fusion, feature clustering, and recessive feature
location, thereby significantly minimizing the overall loss. Specifically, we
innovatively put forward a general grid position encoding compensation to
effectively address the issue of positional information missing during the
feature extraction process of specific ordinary convolutions. Additionally, we
further propose a general frequency domain location embedding technique to
offset for the location loss in clustering features. We have carried out
validation procedures on three representative fine-grained few-shot benchmarks.
Relevant experiments have established that LCN-4 notably outperforms the
ConvNet-4 based State-of-the-Arts and achieves performance that is on par with
or superior to most ResNet12-based methods, confirming the correctness of our
conjecture.

Abstract: We present Ov3R, a novel framework for open-vocabulary semantic 3D
reconstruction from RGB video streams, designed to advance Spatial AI. The
system features two key components: CLIP3R, a CLIP-informed 3D reconstruction
module that predicts dense point maps from overlapping clips while embedding
object-level semantics; and 2D-3D OVS, a 2D-3D open-vocabulary semantic module
that lifts 2D features into 3D by learning fused descriptors integrating
spatial, geometric, and semantic cues. Unlike prior methods, Ov3R incorporates
CLIP semantics directly into the reconstruction process, enabling globally
consistent geometry and fine-grained semantic alignment. Our framework achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both dense 3D reconstruction and
open-vocabulary 3D segmentation, marking a step forward toward real-time,

Abstract: Difficult few-shot image recognition has significant application prospects,
yet remaining the substantial technical gaps with the conventional large-scale

for few-shot image recognition, called CIELab-Guided Coherent Meta-Learning
(MetaLab). Structurally, our MetaLab comprises two collaborative neural
networks: LabNet, which can perform domain transformation for the CIELab color
space and extract rich grouped features, and coherent LabGNN, which can
facilitate mutual learning between lightness graph and color graph. For
sufficient certification, we have implemented extensive comparative studies on
four coarse-grained benchmarks, four fine-grained benchmarks, and four
cross-domain few-shot benchmarks. Specifically, our method can achieve high
accuracy, robust performance, and effective generalization capability with
one-shot sample per class. Overall, all experiments have demonstrated that our
MetaLab can approach 99\% $\uparrow\downarrow$ accuracy, reaching the human
recognition ceiling with little visual deviation.

Result: X-Omni在图像生成任务中达到SOTA性能，生成高质量图像并具备强指令执行能力。

Conclusion: 强化学习可有效提升离散自回归模型的生成质量，为图像与语言统一建模提供新思路。

Abstract: Numerous efforts have been made to extend the ``next token prediction''
paradigm to visual contents, aiming to create a unified approach for both image
generation and understanding. Nevertheless, attempts to generate images through
autoregressive modeling with discrete tokens have been plagued by issues such
as low visual fidelity, distorted outputs, and failure to adhere to complex
instructions when rendering intricate details. These shortcomings are likely
attributed to cumulative errors during autoregressive inference or information
loss incurred during the discretization process. Probably due to this
challenge, recent research has increasingly shifted toward jointly training
image generation with diffusion objectives and language generation with
autoregressive objectives, moving away from unified modeling approaches. In
this work, we demonstrate that reinforcement learning can effectively mitigate
artifacts and largely enhance the generation quality of a discrete
autoregressive modeling method, thereby enabling seamless integration of image
and language generation. Our framework comprises a semantic image tokenizer, a
unified autoregressive model for both language and images, and an offline
diffusion decoder for image generation, termed X-Omni. X-Omni achieves
state-of-the-art performance in image generation tasks using a 7B language
model, producing images with high aesthetic quality while exhibiting strong
capabilities in following instructions and rendering long texts.

TL;DR: StepAL是一种针对手术视频步骤识别的主动学习框架，通过全视频选择和熵加权聚类策略，显著减少了标注成本并提高了识别准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统主动学习方法在手术视频分析中效果不佳，因为它们通常选择单帧或短片段标注，而手术步骤识别需要整个视频的上下文。

Method: StepAL结合了步骤感知特征表示和熵加权聚类策略，优先选择不确定且步骤多样化的视频进行标注。

Result: 在Cataract-1k和Cataract-101数据集上，StepAL表现优于现有方法，以更少的标注视频实现了更高的步骤识别准确率。

Conclusion: StepAL为手术视频分析提供了一种高效方法，显著降低了计算机辅助手术系统的开发成本。

Abstract: Active learning (AL) can reduce annotation costs in surgical video analysis
while maintaining model performance. However, traditional AL methods, developed
for images or short video clips, are suboptimal for surgical step recognition
due to inter-step dependencies within long, untrimmed surgical videos. These
methods typically select individual frames or clips for labeling, which is
ineffective for surgical videos where annotators require the context of the
entire video for annotation. To address this, we propose StepAL, an active
learning framework designed for full video selection in surgical step
recognition. StepAL integrates a step-aware feature representation, which
leverages pseudo-labels to capture the distribution of predicted steps within
each video, with an entropy-weighted clustering strategy. This combination
prioritizes videos that are both uncertain and exhibit diverse step
compositions for annotation. Experiments on two cataract surgery datasets
(Cataract-1k and Cataract-101) demonstrate that StepAL consistently outperforms
existing active learning approaches, achieving higher accuracy in step
recognition with fewer labeled videos. StepAL offers an effective approach for
efficient surgical video analysis, reducing the annotation burden in developing
computer-assisted surgical systems.

Motivation: 现有FSVOS方法主要关注静态对象类别，忽略了视频中的动态运动模式，限制了其在需要运动理解的场景中的应用。

Method: 作者提出了Decoupled Motion Appearance Network（DMA）作为基线方法，并在MOVE数据集上评估了6种现有方法。

Result: 实验表明，现有方法在运动引导FSVOS任务中表现不佳，而DMA方法在少样本运动理解中取得了优越性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为未来运动引导FSVOS的研究奠定了基础，并提出了一个有效的基线方法。

Abstract: This work addresses motion-guided few-shot video object segmentation (FSVOS),
which aims to segment dynamic objects in videos based on a few annotated
examples with the same motion patterns. Existing FSVOS datasets and methods
typically focus on object categories, which are static attributes that ignore
the rich temporal dynamics in videos, limiting their application in scenarios
requiring motion understanding. To fill this gap, we introduce MOVE, a
large-scale dataset specifically designed for motion-guided FSVOS. Based on
MOVE, we comprehensively evaluate 6 state-of-the-art methods from 3 different
related tasks across 2 experimental settings. Our results reveal that current
methods struggle to address motion-guided FSVOS, prompting us to analyze the
associated challenges and propose a baseline method, Decoupled Motion
Appearance Network (DMA). Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
superior performance in few shot motion understanding, establishing a solid
foundation for future research in this direction.

Motivation: 解决深度神经网络在持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，借鉴人类学习策略（如主动回忆、刻意练习和间隔重复）来提升模型性能。

Method: 提出TFC-SR方法，结合主动回忆探针（Active Recall Probe）和标准经验回放，定期评估模型记忆以稳定过去知识的表示。

Result: 在Split MNIST和Split CIFAR-100基准测试中，TFC-SR显著优于现有方法，例如在Split CIFAR-100上达到13.17%的准确率，而标准回放方法仅为7.40%。

Conclusion: TFC-SR是一种高效且鲁棒的持续学习方法，强调了在持续学习系统中整合主动记忆检索机制的重要性。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks often suffer from a critical limitation known as
Catastrophic Forgetting, where performance on past tasks degrades after
learning new ones. This paper introduces a novel continual learning approach
inspired by human learning strategies like Active Recall, Deliberate Practice
and Spaced Repetition, named Task Focused Consolidation with Spaced Recall
(TFC-SR). TFC-SR enhances the standard experience replay with a mechanism we
termed the Active Recall Probe. It is a periodic, task-aware evaluation of the
model's memory that stabilizes the representations of past knowledge. We test
TFC-SR on the Split MNIST and Split CIFAR-100 benchmarks against leading
regularization-based and replay-based baselines. Our results show that TFC-SR
performs significantly better than these methods. For instance, on the Split
CIFAR-100, it achieves a final accuracy of 13.17% compared to standard replay's
7.40%. We demonstrate that this advantage comes from the stabilizing effect of
the probe itself, and not from the difference in replay volume. Additionally,
we analyze the trade-off between memory size and performance and show that
while TFC-SR performs better in memory-constrained environments, higher replay
volume is still more effective when available memory is abundant. We conclude
that TFC-SR is a robust and efficient approach, highlighting the importance of
integrating active memory retrieval mechanisms into continual learning systems.

Conclusion: QCML的量子几何表示有助于在量子认知框架下更深入地理解认知现象。

Abstract: We demonstrate how Quantum Cognition Machine Learning (QCML) encodes data as
quantum geometry. In QCML, features of the data are represented by learned
Hermitian matrices, and data points are mapped to states in Hilbert space. The
quantum geometry description endows the dataset with rich geometric and
topological structure - including intrinsic dimension, quantum metric, and
Berry curvature - derived directly from the data. QCML captures global
properties of data, while avoiding the curse of dimensionality inherent in
local methods. We illustrate this on a number of synthetic and real-world
examples. Quantum geometric representation of QCML could advance our
understanding of cognitive phenomena within the framework of quantum cognition.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于独立性准则的无监督和监督降维方法，在性能和可解释性上优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖核函数捕捉数据非线性，但需专家确保其最大化数据多样性。本文旨在设计更有效的独立性准则以改进降维方法。

Method: 提出了3种独立性准则，并基于此设计了无监督和监督降维方法，在线性和非线性设置下评估了对比度、准确性和可解释性。

Result: 方法在性能上优于基线（如tSNE、PCA、VAE等），并推动了可解释机器学习的研究。

Conclusion: 该方法为研究者提供了一条新的可解释机器学习路径，性能显著优于现有基线。

Abstract: Unsupervised and supervised learning methods conventionally use kernels to
capture nonlinearities inherent in data structure. However experts have to
ensure their proposed nonlinearity maximizes variability and capture inherent
diversity of data. We reviewed all independence criteria to design unsupervised
learners. Then we proposed 3 independence criteria and used them to design
unsupervised and supervised dimensionality reduction methods. We evaluated
contrast, accuracy and interpretability of these methods in both linear and
neural nonlinear settings. The results show that the methods have outperformed
the baseline (tSNE, PCA, regularized LDA, VAE with (un)supervised learner and
layer sharing) and opened a new line of interpretable machine learning (ML) for
the researchers.

Result: 实验验证了所提方法的有效性，能够在保持性能的同时减少计算负担。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为野火预测提供了一种高效且可行的解决方案，适用于复杂和不平衡的数据环境。

Abstract: Wildfires significantly impact natural ecosystems and human health, leading
to biodiversity loss, increased hydrogeological risks, and elevated emissions
of toxic substances. Climate change exacerbates these effects, particularly in
regions with rising temperatures and prolonged dry periods, such as the
Mediterranean. This requires the development of advanced risk management
strategies that utilize state-of-the-art technologies. However, in this
context, the data show a bias toward an imbalanced setting, where the incidence
of wildfire events is significantly lower than typical situations. This
imbalance, coupled with the inherent complexity of high-dimensional
spatio-temporal data, poses significant challenges for training deep learning
architectures. Moreover, since precise wildfire predictions depend mainly on
weather data, finding a way to reduce computational costs to enable more
frequent updates using the latest weather forecasts would be beneficial. This
paper investigates how adopting a contrastive framework can address these
challenges through enhanced latent representations for the patch's dynamic
features. We thus introduce a new morphology-based curriculum contrastive
learning that mitigates issues associated with diverse regional characteristics
and enables the use of smaller patch sizes without compromising performance. An
experimental analysis is performed to validate the effectiveness of the
proposed modeling strategies.

Method: 采用动态部分收缩阈值（DPST）算法，结合深度展开神经网络和Wirtinger微积分，减少可训练参数数量。

Result: 数值结果表明，该方法在检测性能上优于现有方法，迭代次数更少，计算复杂度更低。

Conclusion: 该方法为下一代大规模MIMO系统提供了一种实用的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a deep unfolding neural network-based MIMO detector
that incorporates complex-valued computations using Wirtinger calculus. The
method, referred as Dynamic Partially Shrinkage Thresholding (DPST), enables
efficient, interpretable, and low-complexity MIMO signal detection. Unlike
prior approaches that rely on real-valued approximations, our method operates
natively in the complex domain, aligning with the fundamental nature of signal
processing tasks. The proposed algorithm requires only a small number of
trainable parameters, allowing for simplified training. Numerical results
demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior detection performance
with fewer iterations and lower computational complexity, making it a practical
solution for next-generation massive MIMO systems.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in time series forecasting, accurate
modeling of time series with strong heterogeneity in magnitude and/or sparsity
patterns remains challenging for state-of-the-art deep learning architectures.
We identify several factors that lead existing models to systematically
underperform on low-magnitude and sparse time series, including loss functions
with implicit biases toward high-magnitude series, training-time sampling
methods, and limitations of time series encoding methods.
  SPADE-S is a robust forecasting architecture that significantly reduces
magnitude- and sparsity-based systematic biases and improves overall prediction
accuracy. Empirical results demonstrate that SPADE-S outperforms existing
state-of-the-art approaches across a diverse set of use cases in demand
forecasting. In particular, we show that, depending on the quantile forecast
and magnitude of the series, SPADE-S can improve forecast accuracy by up to
15%. This results in P90 overall forecast accuracy gains of 2.21%, 6.58%, and
4.28%, and P50 forecast accuracy gains of 0.92%, 0.77%, and 1.95%,

Result: 总结了检测、测量和缓解分布偏移的技术，并指出当前研究的不足。

Conclusion: 未来需进一步研究分布偏移处理机制，尤其是对OOD数据的关注。

Abstract: In the field of Machine Learning (ML) and data-driven applications, one of
the significant challenge is the change in data distribution between the
training and deployment stages, commonly known as distribution shift. This
paper outlines different mechanisms for handling two main types of distribution
shifts: (i) Covariate shift: where the value of features or covariates change
between train and test data, and (ii) Concept/Semantic-shift: where model
experiences shift in the concept learned during training due to emergence of
novel classes in the test phase. We sum up our contributions in three folds.
First, we formalize distribution shifts, recite on how the conventional method
fails to handle them adequately and urge for a model that can simultaneously
perform better in all types of distribution shifts. Second, we discuss why
handling distribution shifts is important and provide an extensive review of
the methods and techniques that have been developed to detect, measure, and
mitigate the effects of these shifts. Third, we discuss the current state of
distribution shift handling mechanisms and propose future research directions
in this area. Overall, we provide a retrospective synopsis of the literature in
the distribution shift, focusing on OOD data that had been overlooked in the
existing surveys.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无监督异常检测（UAD）中，现有方法存在重建异常过于完美或特征空间次优的问题，需要一种更紧密耦合的方法。

Method: 提出了一种新方法，通过自定义损失公式将表示学习与可解析的OCSVM紧密耦合。

Result: 在MNIST-C基准和脑MRI微小病变检测任务中表现出色，尤其在非高信号小病变检测上优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在性能和鲁棒性上表现优异，适用于一般UAD和医学影像应用。

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) aims to detect anomalies without labeled
data, a necessity in many machine learning applications where anomalous samples
are rare or not available. Most state-of-the-art methods fall into two
categories: reconstruction-based approaches, which often reconstruct anomalies
too well, and decoupled representation learning with density estimators, which
can suffer from suboptimal feature spaces. While some recent methods attempt to
couple feature learning and anomaly detection, they often rely on surrogate
objectives, restrict kernel choices, or introduce approximations that limit
their expressiveness and robustness. To address this challenge, we propose a
novel method that tightly couples representation learning with an analytically
solvable one-class SVM (OCSVM), through a custom loss formulation that directly
aligns latent features with the OCSVM decision boundary. The model is evaluated
on two tasks: a new benchmark based on MNIST-C, and a challenging brain MRI
subtle lesion detection task. Unlike most methods that focus on large,
hyperintense lesions at the image level, our approach succeeds to target small,
non-hyperintense lesions, while we evaluate voxel-wise metrics, addressing a
more clinically relevant scenario. Both experiments evaluate a form of
robustness to domain shifts, including corruption types in MNIST-C and
scanner/age variations in MRI. Results demonstrate performance and robustness
of our proposed mode,highlighting its potential for general UAD and real-world
medical imaging applications. The source code is available at

Abstract: Progress in complex reasoning is constrained by the static nature of the

self-evolving framework, AGORA, enables a collaborative ensemble to achieve
reasoning performance exceeding state-of-the-art monolithic systems by up to
4.45 percentage points on challenging mathematical benchmarks. This gain stems
from group emergent ability-the synthesis of collective capabilities
unattainable by isolated models, validating interaction as a scalable driver of

Conclusion: LAI-ML成功将黑盒模型预测转化为可信且可解释的临床见解。

Abstract: Background & Aims: High-performance machine learning models like XGBoost are
often "black boxes," limiting their clinical adoption due to a lack of
interpretability. This study aims to bridge the gap between predictive accuracy
and narrative transparency for sarcopenia risk assessment. Methods: We propose
the LLM-Adapted Interpretation Framework (LAI-ML), a novel knowledge
distillation architecture. LAI-ML transforms feature attributions from a
trained XGBoost model into a probabilistic format using specialized techniques
(HAGA and CACS). A Large Language Model (LLM), guided by a reinforcement
learning loop and case-based retrieval, then generates data-faithful diagnostic
narratives. Results: The LAI-ML framework achieved 83% prediction accuracy,
significantly outperforming the baseline XGBoost model, 13% higher. Notably,
the LLM not only replicated the teacher model's logic but also corrected its
predictions in 21.7% of discordant cases, demonstrating enhanced reasoning.
Conclusion: LAI-ML effectively translates opaque model predictions into
trustworthy and interpretable clinical insights, offering a deployable solution
to the "black-box" problem in medical AI.

TL;DR: MaPPO是一种新的偏好优化框架，通过整合先验奖励知识改进现有方法，无需额外超参数，适用于离线和在线场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有偏好优化方法（如DPO）将偏好学习视为MLE问题，忽略了先验奖励知识，可能导致对齐性能不足。

Method: MaPPO将先验奖励估计整合到最大后验（MaP）目标中，扩展了MLE范式，支持离线和在线优化。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，MaPPO显著提升了对齐性能，且不影响计算效率。

Conclusion: MaPPO是一种高效且通用的偏好优化方法，优于现有技术。

Abstract: As the era of large language models (LLMs) on behalf of users unfolds,
Preference Optimization (PO) methods have become a central approach to aligning
LLMs with human preferences and improving performance. We propose Maximum a
Posteriori Preference Optimization (MaPPO), a framework for learning from
preferences that explicitly incorporates prior reward knowledge into the
optimization objective. While existing methods such as Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) and its variants treat preference learning as a Maximum
Likelihood Estimation (MLE) problem, MaPPO extends this paradigm by integrating
prior reward estimates into a principled Maximum a Posteriori (MaP) objective.
This not only generalizes DPO and its variants, but also enhances alignment by
mitigating the oversimplified binary classification of responses. More
importantly, MaPPO introduces no additional hyperparameter, and supports
preference optimization in both offline and online settings. In addition, MaPPO
can be used as a plugin with consistent improvement on DPO variants, including
widely used SimPO, IPO, and CPO. Extensive empirical evaluations of different
model sizes and model series on three standard benchmarks, including MT-Bench,
AlpacaEval 2.0, and Arena-Hard, demonstrate consistent improvements in
alignment performance without sacrificing computational efficiency.

Conclusion: EvoSLD在准确性、可解释性和效率上优于基线方法，展示了其在AI研究中的潜力。

Abstract: Scaling laws are fundamental mathematical relationships that predict how
neural network performance evolves with changes in variables such as model
size, dataset size, and computational resources. Traditionally, discovering
these laws requires extensive human expertise and manual experimentation. We
introduce EvoSLD, an automated framework for Scaling Law Discovery (SLD) that
leverages evolutionary algorithms guided by Large Language Models (LLMs) to
co-evolve symbolic expressions and their optimization routines. Formulated to
handle scaling variables, control variables, and response metrics across
diverse experimental settings, EvoSLD searches for parsimonious, universal
functional forms that minimize fitting errors on grouped data subsets.
Evaluated on five real-world scenarios from recent literature, EvoSLD
rediscovers exact human-derived laws in two cases and surpasses them in others,
achieving up to orders-of-magnitude reductions in normalized mean squared error
on held-out test sets. Compared to baselines like symbolic regression and
ablated variants, EvoSLD demonstrates superior accuracy, interpretability, and
efficiency, highlighting its potential to accelerate AI research. Code is

Motivation: 临床LLMs在静态基准测试中表现良好，但在输入微小变化（如症状掩盖或否定）时表现不佳，且标准NLP指标无法检测这些潜在表示变化。

Method: 提出LAPD框架，通过结构化对抗编辑（掩盖、否定、同义词替换、数值变化）生成临床笔记，并利用PCA降维空间中的LDFR指标评估模型鲁棒性。

Result: 实验发现，即使表面变化极小，临床LLMs仍表现出潜在脆弱性，且在真实临床数据集（MIMIC-IV）上验证了LDFR的普适性。

Conclusion: 研究表明表面鲁棒性与语义稳定性存在差距，强调几何感知评估在临床AI中的重要性。

Abstract: LLMs for clinical decision support often fail under small but clinically
meaningful input shifts such as masking a symptom or negating a finding,
despite high performance on static benchmarks. These reasoning failures
frequently go undetected by standard NLP metrics, which are insensitive to
latent representation shifts that drive diagnosis instability. We propose a
geometry-aware evaluation framework, LAPD (Latent Agentic Perturbation
Diagnostics), which systematically probes the latent robustness of clinical
LLMs under structured adversarial edits. Within this framework, we introduce
Latent Diagnosis Flip Rate (LDFR), a model-agnostic diagnostic signal that
captures representational instability when embeddings cross decision boundaries
in PCA-reduced latent space. Clinical notes are generated using a structured
prompting pipeline grounded in diagnostic reasoning, then perturbed along four
axes: masking, negation, synonym replacement, and numeric variation to simulate
common ambiguities and omissions. We compute LDFR across both foundation and
clinical LLMs, finding that latent fragility emerges even under minimal
surface-level changes. Finally, we validate our findings on 90 real clinical
notes from the DiReCT benchmark (MIMIC-IV), confirming the generalizability of
LDFR beyond synthetic settings. Our results reveal a persistent gap between
surface robustness and semantic stability, underscoring the importance of
geometry-aware auditing in safety-critical clinical AI.

Method: 使用GLWT分解图节点信号，通过非线性调制和小波系数重组，结合符号逻辑和领域特定语言（DSL）实现推理。

Result: 在合成图去噪和语言标记图任务中表现优于轻量级图神经网络（GNN），且透明性和效率更高。

Conclusion: 该框架为图学习提供了一种原理清晰、可解释且资源高效的替代方案。

Abstract: We present a fully non neural learning framework based on Graph Laplacian
Wavelet Transforms (GLWT). Unlike traditional architectures that rely on
convolutional, recurrent, or attention based neural networks, our model
operates purely in the graph spectral domain using structured multiscale
filtering, nonlinear shrinkage, and symbolic logic over wavelet coefficients.
Signals defined on graph nodes are decomposed via GLWT, modulated with
interpretable nonlinearities, and recombined for downstream tasks such as
denoising and token classification. The system supports compositional reasoning
through a symbolic domain-specific language (DSL) over graph wavelet
activations. Experiments on synthetic graph denoising and linguistic token
graphs demonstrate competitive performance against lightweight GNNs with far
greater transparency and efficiency. This work proposes a principled,
interpretable, and resource-efficient alternative to deep neural architectures

Result: 方法在异质图中表现不一致，且无法泛化到不同结构的图上。

Conclusion: 结构学习能改善长距离依赖捕捉，但需进一步优化以适应不同异质图结构。

Abstract: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) gained traction for graph representation
learning, with recent attention on improving performance on heterophilic graphs
for various real-world applications. The localized feature aggregation in a
typical message-passing paradigm hinders the capturing of long-range
dependencies between non-local nodes of the same class. The inherent
connectivity structure in heterophilic graphs often conflicts with information
sharing between distant nodes of same class. We propose structure learning to
rewire edges in shallow GCNs itself to avoid performance degradation in
downstream discriminative tasks due to oversmoothing. Parameterizing the
adjacency matrix to learn connections between non-local nodes and extend the
hop span of shallow GCNs facilitates the capturing of long-range dependencies.
However, our method is not generalizable across heterophilic graphs and
performs inconsistently on node classification task contingent to the graph
structure.

for robust simulation-based agent training. Our multi-layer architecture
includes: (1) on-device edge intelligence; (2) digital twin synchronization;
and (3) generative scenario training. Experimental simulations demonstrate
notable improvements over EdgeAgentX, including faster learning convergence,
higher network throughput, reduced latency, and improved resilience against
jamming and node failures. A case study involving a complex tactical scenario
with simultaneous jamming attacks, agent failures, and increased network loads
illustrates how EdgeAgentX-DT sustains operational performance, whereas
baseline methods fail. These results highlight the potential of
digital-twin-enabled generative training to strengthen edge AI deployments in
contested environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AdaptHetero是一个基于机器学习解释的框架，通过SHAP和聚类方法，优化EHR数据中的子群体建模，提升预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EHR数据的复杂性和异质性限制了机器学习解释在子群体建模中的效果，需要一种方法将解释性转化为具体指导。

Method: 结合SHAP解释和无监督聚类，识别子群体特征，优化模型训练和评估。

Result: 在三个大规模EHR数据集上验证，AdaptHetero能有效识别异质性模型行为，提升预测性能。

Conclusion: AdaptHetero通过解释性驱动的子群体建模，为临床决策提供了更精准的指导。

Abstract: Machine learning interpretation has primarily been leveraged to build
clinician trust and uncover actionable insights in EHRs. However, the intrinsic
complexity and heterogeneity of EHR data limit its effectiveness in guiding
subgroup-specific modeling. We propose AdaptHetero, a novel MLI-driven
framework that transforms interpretability insights into actionable guidance
for tailoring model training and evaluation across subpopulations within
individual hospital systems. Evaluated on three large-scale EHR datasets -
GOSSIS-1-eICU, WiDS, and MIMIC-IV - AdaptHetero consistently identifies
heterogeneous model behaviors in predicting ICU mortality, in-hospital death,
and hidden hypoxemia. By integrating SHAP-based interpretation and unsupervised
clustering, the framework enhances the identification of clinically meaningful
subgroup-specific characteristics, leading to improved predictive performance.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对语言模型的梯度反转攻击方法Grab，通过混合优化显著提高了私有训练数据的恢复率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 梯度反转攻击在联邦学习中对语言模型的隐私威胁被低估，本文旨在揭示其潜在风险。

Method: 提出Grab方法，结合交替优化过程，包括对dropout掩码的优化和离散优化以改进令牌恢复和排序。

Result: Grab在基准和实际设置中分别实现了高达28.9%和48.5%的恢复率提升，最高恢复率达92.9%。

Conclusion: Grab为理解联邦学习中语言模型的隐私威胁提供了重要进展。

Abstract: The gradient inversion attack has been demonstrated as a significant privacy
threat to federated learning (FL), particularly in continuous domains such as
vision models. In contrast, it is often considered less effective or highly
dependent on impractical training settings when applied to language models, due
to the challenges posed by the discrete nature of tokens in text data. As a
result, its potential privacy threats remain largely underestimated, despite FL
being an emerging training method for language models. In this work, we propose
a domain-specific gradient inversion attack named Grab (gradient inversion with
hybrid optimization). Grab features two alternating optimization processes to
address the challenges caused by practical training settings, including a
simultaneous optimization on dropout masks between layers for improved token
recovery and a discrete optimization for effective token sequencing. Grab can
recover a significant portion (up to 92.9% recovery rate) of the private
training data, outperforming the attack strategy of utilizing discrete
optimization with an auxiliary model by notable improvements of up to 28.9%
recovery rate in benchmark settings and 48.5% recovery rate in practical
settings. Grab provides a valuable step forward in understanding this privacy
threat in the emerging FL training mode of language models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用单一组合式LLM完成多种交互式多模态应用（IMAs）的新范式，解决了现有方法依赖多个LLM的问题。通过ContextLoRA和ContextGear方法，分别解决了LLM适应多样目标和资源受限环境下的效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖多个LLM处理不同IMAs任务，导致资源浪费和效率低下。本文旨在通过单一LLM实现多样化任务，提升灵活性和效率。

Method: 提出ContextLoRA方法，通过任务依赖图引导LLM学习IMAs的结构化上下文，并分区参数矩阵；开发分步微调流程。ContextGear策略优化训练过程，降低计算和通信成本。

Result: 在三个基准测试中表现优越，并在真实无线测试平台上验证了实用性。

Conclusion: 单一组合式LLM范式在IMAs中具有高效性和实用性，ContextLoRA和ContextGear方法显著提升了任务适应性和资源效率。

Abstract: Interactive multimodal applications (IMAs), such as route planning in the
Internet of Vehicles, enrich users' personalized experiences by integrating
various forms of data over wireless networks. Recent advances in large language
models (LLMs) utilize mixture-of-experts (MoE) mechanisms to empower multiple
IMAs, with each LLM trained individually for a specific task that presents
different business workflows. In contrast to existing approaches that rely on
multiple LLMs for IMAs, this paper presents a novel paradigm that accomplishes
various IMAs using a single compositional LLM over wireless networks. The two
primary challenges include 1) guiding a single LLM to adapt to diverse IMA
objectives and 2) ensuring the flexibility and efficiency of the LLM in
resource-constrained mobile environments. To tackle the first challenge, we
propose ContextLoRA, a novel method that guides an LLM to learn the rich
structured context among IMAs by constructing a task dependency graph. We
partition the learnable parameter matrix of neural layers for each IMA to
facilitate LLM composition. Then, we develop a step-by-step fine-tuning
procedure guided by task relations, including training, freezing, and masking
phases. This allows the LLM to learn to reason among tasks for better
adaptation, capturing the latent dependencies between tasks. For the second
challenge, we introduce ContextGear, a scheduling strategy to optimize the
training procedure of ContextLoRA, aiming to minimize computational and
communication costs through a strategic grouping mechanism. Experiments on
three benchmarks show the superiority of the proposed ContextLoRA and
ContextGear. Furthermore, we prototype our proposed paradigm on a real-world
wireless testbed, demonstrating its practical applicability for various IMAs.
We will release our code to the community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界数据分布不均衡且长尾，传统算法表现不佳，需开发能直接从非完美数据中学习的鲁棒算法。

Method: 提出四部分方法：1）从长尾数据学习生成模型；2）通过归纳正则化提升尾类泛化能力；3）半监督学习优化指标；4）高效域适应。

Result: 解决了长尾数据中的模式崩溃问题，提升了尾类泛化能力，优化了半监督学习指标，并实现少样本域适应。

Conclusion: 开发了适用于现实世界数据分布的深度学习算法，减少了对数据标注的依赖，提升了模型在非均衡数据上的表现。

Abstract: The distribution of data in the world (eg, internet, etc.) significantly
differs from the well-curated datasets and is often over-populated with samples
from common categories. The algorithms designed for well-curated datasets
perform suboptimally when used for learning from imperfect datasets with
long-tailed imbalances and distribution shifts. To expand the use of deep
models, it is essential to overcome the labor-intensive curation process by
developing robust algorithms that can learn from diverse, real-world data
distributions. Toward this goal, we develop practical algorithms for Deep
Neural Networks which can learn from limited and imperfect data present in the
real world. This thesis is divided into four segments, each covering a scenario
of learning from limited or imperfect data. The first part of the thesis
focuses on Learning Generative Models from Long-Tail Data, where we mitigate
the mode-collapse and enable diverse aesthetic image generations for tail
(minority) classes. In the second part, we enable effective generalization on
tail classes through Inductive Regularization schemes, which allow tail classes
to generalize as effectively as the head classes without requiring explicit
generation of images. In the third part, we develop algorithms for Optimizing
Relevant Metrics for learning from long-tailed data with limited annotation
(semi-supervised), followed by the fourth part, which focuses on the Efficient
Domain Adaptation of the model to various domains with very few to zero labeled
samples.

TL;DR: Bubbleformer是一种基于Transformer的时空模型，能够自主预测沸腾动力学，无需依赖模拟数据，并在多相沸腾流中取得了新的基准结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在推理时需要未来输入（如气泡位置），且无法从过去状态学习成核现象，限制了自主预测沸腾动力学的能力。此外，这些模型无法模拟流动沸腾速度场。

Method: Bubbleformer结合了因子化轴向注意力、频率感知缩放和热物理参数条件化，以泛化到不同流体、几何形状和操作条件。

Result: Bubbleformer在预测和预报两相沸腾流方面取得了新的基准结果，并提出了基于物理的可解释性指标来评估热流一致性、界面几何和质量守恒。

Conclusion: Bubbleformer通过创新的模型设计和高质量数据集BubbleML 2.0，显著提升了沸腾动力学的预测能力，为能源和热系统研究提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Modeling boiling (an inherently chaotic, multiphase process central to energy
and thermal systems) remains a significant challenge for neural PDE surrogates.
Existing models require future input (e.g., bubble positions) during inference
because they fail to learn nucleation from past states, limiting their ability
to autonomously forecast boiling dynamics. They also fail to model flow boiling
velocity fields, where sharp interface-momentum coupling demands long-range and
directional inductive biases. We introduce Bubbleformer, a transformer-based
spatiotemporal model that forecasts stable and long-range boiling dynamics
including nucleation, interface evolution, and heat transfer without dependence
on simulation data during inference. Bubbleformer integrates factorized axial
attention, frequency-aware scaling, and conditions on thermophysical parameters
to generalize across fluids, geometries, and operating conditions. To evaluate
physical fidelity in chaotic systems, we propose interpretable physics-based
metrics that evaluate heat-flux consistency, interface geometry, and mass
conservation. We also release BubbleML 2.0, a high-fidelity dataset that spans
diverse working fluids (cryogens, refrigerants, dielectrics), boiling
configurations (pool and flow boiling), flow regimes (bubbly, slug, annular),
and boundary conditions. Bubbleformer sets new benchmark results in both
prediction and forecasting of two-phase boiling flows.

Method: 提出Adam-PnP框架，包含自适应噪声估计和动态模态加权机制，集成到扩散过程中。

Result: 在复杂重构任务中显著提高了准确性。

Conclusion: Adam-PnP为蛋白质结构生成提供了一种高效且自动化的多源数据整合方法。

Abstract: In an inverse problem, the goal is to recover an unknown parameter (e.g., an
image) that has typically undergone some lossy or noisy transformation during
measurement. Recently, deep generative models, particularly diffusion models,
have emerged as powerful priors for protein structure generation. However,
integrating noisy experimental data from multiple sources to guide these models
remains a significant challenge. Existing methods often require precise
knowledge of experimental noise levels and manually tuned weights for each data
modality. In this work, we introduce Adam-PnP, a Plug-and-Play framework that
guides a pre-trained protein diffusion model using gradients from multiple,
heterogeneous experimental sources. Our framework features an adaptive noise
estimation scheme and a dynamic modality weighting mechanism integrated into
the diffusion process, which reduce the need for manual hyperparameter tuning.
Experiments on complex reconstruction tasks demonstrate significantly improved
accuracy using Adam-PnP.

Motivation: PCE在物理模拟和不确定性量化中广泛应用，但其在高维问题中扩展性差。

Method: 结合PCE与概率电路思想，提出DeepPCE，通过深度泛化提升扩展性。

Result: DeepPCE在高维输入空间中表现与多层感知器（MLP）相当，同时保留PCE的精确统计推断能力。

Conclusion: DeepPCE有效解决了PCE在高维问题中的扩展性问题，同时保持了其统计推断优势。

Abstract: Polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) is a classical and widely used surrogate
modeling technique in physical simulation and uncertainty quantification. By
taking a linear combination of a set of basis polynomials - orthonormal with
respect to the distribution of uncertain input parameters - PCE enables
tractable inference of key statistical quantities, such as (conditional) means,
variances, covariances, and Sobol sensitivity indices, which are essential for
understanding the modeled system and identifying influential parameters and
their interactions. As the number of basis functions grows exponentially with
the number of parameters, PCE does not scale well to high-dimensional problems.
We address this challenge by combining PCE with ideas from probabilistic
circuits, resulting in the deep polynomial chaos expansion (DeepPCE) - a deep
generalization of PCE that scales effectively to high-dimensional input spaces.
DeepPCE achieves predictive performance comparable to that of multi-layer
perceptrons (MLPs), while retaining PCE's ability to compute exact statistical
inferences via simple forward passes.

TL;DR: LAAC是一种结合大型语言模型（LLM）和强化学习的方法，通过双层优化提升推荐系统的多样性和新颖性，同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推荐系统通常过于关注点击相关性，而忽视了多样性和新颖性，导致用户探索不足。现有强化学习方法依赖随机探索，可能与用户兴趣不符。

Method: LAAC利用LLM作为参考策略提出新颖项目，并通过轻量级策略优化这些建议。采用双层优化框架，结合正则化防止LLM建议的过度估计。

Result: 实验表明，LAAC在多样性、新颖性和准确性上优于现有基线，且在数据不平衡时表现稳健。

Conclusion: LAAC成功整合了LLM知识，无需昂贵微调，显著提升了推荐系统的综合性能。

Abstract: In recommendation systems, diversity and novelty are essential for capturing
varied user preferences and encouraging exploration, yet many systems
prioritize click relevance. While reinforcement learning (RL) has been explored
to improve diversity, it often depends on random exploration that may not align
with user interests. We propose LAAC (LLM-guided Adversarial Actor Critic), a
novel method that leverages large language models (LLMs) as reference policies
to suggest novel items, while training a lightweight policy to refine these
suggestions using system-specific data. The method formulates training as a
bilevel optimization between actor and critic networks, enabling the critic to
selectively favor promising novel actions and the actor to improve its policy
beyond LLM recommendations. To mitigate overestimation of unreliable LLM
suggestions, we apply regularization that anchors critic values for unexplored
items close to well-estimated dataset actions. Experiments on real-world
datasets show that LAAC outperforms existing baselines in diversity, novelty,
and accuracy, while remaining robust on imbalanced data, effectively
integrating LLM knowledge without expensive fine-tuning.

TL;DR: RAGDP是一种无需额外训练的新框架，通过知识库加速预训练扩散策略（DPs）的推理，提高准确性和速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散策略（DPs）在模仿学习中表现优异，但生成动作需要多步去噪，耗时较长。现有方法（如一致性策略CP）训练时间长，尤其对复杂任务。

Method: RAGDP通过DP编码器构建专家演示的向量数据库，推理时提取最相似专家动作并结合中间去噪步骤，减少所需步骤。

Result: RAGDP在20倍加速下仍保持准确性优势，比CP等蒸馏模型提高7%。

Conclusion: RAGDP无需额外训练，显著改善了DPs的速度与准确性权衡。

Abstract: Diffusion Policies (DPs) have attracted attention for their ability to
achieve significant accuracy improvements in various imitation learning tasks.
However, DPs depend on Diffusion Models, which require multiple noise removal
steps to generate a single action, resulting in long generation times. To solve
this problem, knowledge distillation-based methods such as Consistency Policy
(CP) have been proposed. However, these methods require a significant amount of
training time, especially for difficult tasks. In this study, we propose RAGDP
(Retrieve-Augmented Generation for Diffusion Policies) as a novel framework
that eliminates the need for additional training using a knowledge base to
expedite the inference of pre-trained DPs. In concrete, RAGDP encodes
observation-action pairs through the DP encoder to construct a vector database
of expert demonstrations. During inference, the current observation is
embedded, and the most similar expert action is extracted. This extracted
action is combined with an intermediate noise removal step to reduce the number
of steps required compared to the original diffusion step. We show that by
using RAGDP with the base model and existing acceleration methods, we improve
the accuracy and speed trade-off with no additional training. Even when
accelerating the models 20 times, RAGDP maintains an advantage in accuracy,
with a 7% increase over distillation models such as CP.

Motivation: 虽然数据驱动技术在混沌动力学系统的降阶建模中表现强大，但结合已知物理模型（FOM）可以进一步提升预测能力。

Method: 通过自动编码器找到不变流形的坐标，将FOM的向量场投影到该流形上，并用动态数据修正或作为贝叶斯先验更新。采用神经常微分方程方法。

Result: 在Kuramoto-Sivashinsky和复杂Ginzburg-Landau方程的模拟数据中，混合方法在数据充足、稀缺甚至FOM参数错误的情况下均显著优于纯数据方法。

Conclusion: 混合方法通过结合数据和物理模型，显著提升了混沌动力学系统的预测能力。

Abstract: While data-driven techniques are powerful tools for reduced-order modeling of
systems with chaotic dynamics, great potential remains for leveraging known
physics (i.e. a full-order model (FOM)) to improve predictive capability. We
develop a hybrid reduced order model (ROM), informed by both data and FOM, for
evolving spatiotemporal chaotic dynamics on an invariant manifold whose
coordinates are found using an autoencoder. This approach projects the vector
field of the FOM onto the invariant manifold; then, this physics-derived vector
field is either corrected using dynamic data, or used as a Bayesian prior that
is updated with data. In both cases, the neural ordinary differential equation
approach is used. We consider simulated data from the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and
complex Ginzburg-Landau equations. Relative to the data-only approach, for
scenarios of abundant data, scarce data, and even an incorrect FOM (i.e.
erroneous parameter values), the hybrid approach yields substantially improved
time-series predictions.

Conclusion: 该框架为弹性物体的重建与模拟提供了一种高效且物理一致的方法。

Abstract: Neural networks have emerged as a powerful tool for modeling physical
systems, offering the ability to learn complex representations from limited
data while integrating foundational scientific knowledge. In particular,
neuro-symbolic approaches that combine data-driven learning, the neuro, with
symbolic equations and rules, the symbolic, address the tension between methods
that are purely empirical, which risk straying from established physical
principles, and traditional numerical solvers that demand complete geometric
knowledge and can be prohibitively expensive for high-fidelity simulations. In
this work, we present a novel neuro-symbolic framework for reconstructing and
simulating elastic objects directly from sparse multi-view image sequences,
without requiring explicit geometric information. Specifically, we integrate a
neural radiance field (NeRF) for object reconstruction with physics-informed
neural networks (PINN) that incorporate the governing partial differential
equations of elasticity. In doing so, our method learns a spatiotemporal
representation of deforming objects that leverages both image supervision and
symbolic physical constraints. To handle complex boundary and initial
conditions, which are traditionally confronted using finite element methods,
boundary element methods, or sensor-based measurements, we employ an
energy-constrained Physics-Informed Neural Network architecture. This design
enhances both simulation accuracy and the explainability of results.

Result: 在UCR Archive和模拟数据集上的实验表明，CDNet显著提升了现有深度学习分类器的性能。

Conclusion: CDNet在噪声、相似和多模态条件下优于现有方法，为时间序列分类提供了新思路。

Abstract: Deep learning models are widely used for time series classification (TSC) due
to their scalability and efficiency. However, their performance degrades under
challenging data conditions such as class similarity, multimodal distributions,
and noise. To address these limitations, we propose CDNet, a Contrastive
Diffusion-based Network that enhances existing classifiers by generating
informative positive and negative samples via a learned diffusion process.
Unlike traditional diffusion models that denoise individual samples, CDNet
learns transitions between samples--both within and across classes--through
convolutional approximations of reverse diffusion steps. We introduce a
theoretically grounded CNN-based mechanism to enable both denoising and mode
coverage, and incorporate an uncertainty-weighted composite loss for robust
training. Extensive experiments on the UCR Archive and simulated datasets
demonstrate that CDNet significantly improves state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep
learning classifiers, particularly under noisy, similar, and multimodal
conditions.

Result: 实验表明ECHO在车辆和节点数量变化时优于现有NCO求解器，并展现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: ECHO通过创新方法有效解决了MMHCVRP问题，并通过消融研究验证了各方法的有效性。

Abstract: Numerous Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) solvers have been proposed
to address Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs). However, most of these solvers
focus exclusively on single-vehicle VRP variants, overlooking the more
realistic min-max Heterogeneous Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (MMHCVRP),
which involves multiple vehicles. Existing MMHCVRP solvers typically select a
vehicle and its next node to visit at each decoding step, but often make myopic
decoding decisions and overlook key properties of MMHCVRP, including local
topological relationships, vehicle permutation invariance, and node symmetry,
resulting in suboptimal performance. To better address these limitations, we
propose ECHO, an efficient NCO solver. First, ECHO exploits the proposed
dual-modality node encoder to capture local topological relationships among
nodes. Subsequently, to mitigate myopic decisions, ECHO employs the proposed
Parameter-Free Cross-Attention mechanism to prioritize the vehicle selected in
the preceding decoding step. Finally, leveraging vehicle permutation invariance
and node symmetry, we introduce a tailored data augment strategy for MMHCVRP to
stabilize the Reinforcement Learning training process. To assess the
performance of ECHO, we conduct extensive experiments. The experimental results
demonstrate that ECHO outperforms state-of-the-art NCO solvers across varying
numbers of vehicles and nodes, and exhibits well-performing generalization
across both scales and distribution patterns. Finally, ablation studies
validate the effectiveness of all proposed methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经网络（如RNN、CNN和Transformer）在处理长序列时存在内存限制和计算效率低下的问题，而SSMs虽然能处理长序列，但其训练和推理在传统硬件上计算和内存密集。

Method: 设计了基于脉动阵列的EpochCore加速器，引入LIMA-PE处理单元和ProDF数据流，以高效支持SSMs和传统DNNs。

Result: EpochCore在性能和能效上分别实现了250倍和45倍的提升，尽管面积成本增加了2倍，且在LRA数据集上的推理延迟比GPU内核操作提升了约2000倍。

Conclusion: EpochCore为SSMs提供了一种高效的硬件解决方案，显著提升了长序列任务的性能。

Abstract: Sequence modeling is crucial for AI to understand temporal data and detect
complex time-dependent patterns. While recurrent neural networks (RNNs),
convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and Transformers have advanced in
capturing long-range dependencies, they struggle with achieving high accuracy
with very long sequences due to limited memory retention (fixed context
window). State-Space Models (SSMs) leverage exponentially decaying memory
enabling lengthy context window and so they process very long data sequences
more efficiently than recurrent and Transformer-based models. Unlike
traditional neural models like CNNs and RNNs, SSM-based models require solving
differential equations through continuous integration, making training and
inference both compute- and memory-intensive on conventional CPUs and GPUs. In
this paper we introduce a specialized hardware accelerator, EpochCore, for
accelerating SSMs. EpochCore is based on systolic arrays (SAs) and is designed
to enhance the energy efficiency and throughput of inference of SSM-based
models for long-range sequence tasks. Within the SA, we propose a versatile
processing element (PE) called LIMA-PE to perform traditional and specialized
MAC operations to support traditional DNNs and SSMs. To complement the
EpochCore microarchitecture, we propose a novel dataflow, ProDF, which enables
highly efficient execution of SSM-based models. By leveraging the LIMA-PE
microarchitecture and ProDF, EpochCore achieves on average 250x gains in
performance and 45x improvement in energy efficiency, at the expense of 2x
increase in area cost over traditional SA-based accelerators, and around
~2,000x improvement in latency/inference on LRA datasets compared to GPU kernel
operations.

Result: 样本复杂度为Õ(ε⁻²)，在KuaiRand离线数据集上显著优于其他基线方法。

Conclusion: MOCHA算法在多目标强化学习中具有高效性和理论保证，适用于复杂非凸奖励场景。

Abstract: In many multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) applications, being
able to systematically explore the Pareto-stationary solutions under multiple
non-convex reward objectives with theoretical finite-time sample complexity
guarantee is an important and yet under-explored problem. This motivates us to
take the first step and fill the important gap in MORL. Specifically, in this
paper, we propose a \uline{M}ulti-\uline{O}bjective weighted-\uline{CH}ebyshev
\uline{A}ctor-critic (MOCHA) algorithm for MORL, which judiciously integrates
the weighted-Chebychev (WC) and actor-critic framework to enable
Pareto-stationarity exploration systematically with finite-time sample
complexity guarantee. Sample complexity result of MOCHA algorithm reveals an
interesting dependency on $p_{\min}$ in finding an $\epsilon$-Pareto-stationary
solution, where $p_{\min}$ denotes the minimum entry of a given weight vector
$\mathbf{p}$ in WC-scarlarization. By carefully choosing learning rates, the
sample complexity for each exploration can be
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2})$. Furthermore, simulation studies on a
large KuaiRand offline dataset, show that the performance of MOCHA algorithm
significantly outperforms other baseline MORL approaches.

TL;DR: LIT-PCBA基准数据集存在严重的数据泄漏、重复和结构冗余问题，导致其无法公平评估模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示LIT-PCBA数据集在虚拟筛选基准中的缺陷，以提醒社区开发更可靠的数据集。

Method: 通过审计数据集，识别数据泄漏、重复和结构冗余问题，并设计一个基于记忆的基线模型验证问题。

Result: 发现大量数据重复和泄漏，基线模型仅通过记忆即超越现有先进模型。

Conclusion: LIT-PCBA不适合作为公平评估基准，需开发更严谨的数据集。

Abstract: LIT-PCBA is a widely used benchmark for virtual screening, but our audit
reveals it is fundamentally compromised. The dataset suffers from egregious
data leakage, rampant duplication, and pervasive analog redundancy -- flaws
that invalidate its use for fair model evaluation. Notably, we identify 2,491
inactives duplicated across training and validation sets, and thousands more
repeated within individual data splits (2,945 in training, 789 in validation).
Critically, three ligands in the query set -- meant to represent unseen test
cases -- are leaked: two appear in the training set, one in validation.
Structural redundancy compounds these issues: for some targets, over 80% of
query ligands are near duplicates, with Tanimoto similarity >= 0.9. In ALDH1
alone, we find 323 highly similar active pairs between training and validation
sets, invalidating claims of chemical diversity. These and other flaws
collectively cause models trained on LIT-PCBA to memorize rather than
generalize. To demonstrate the consequences of these data integrity failures,
we implement a trivial memorization-based baseline -- using no learning, no
physics, and no modeling -- that outperforms state-of-the-art models, including
deep neural networks like CHEESE, on LIT-PCBA simply by exploiting these
artifacts. Our findings render the benchmark unfit for its intended purpose and
call into question previous results based on its use. We share this audit to
raise awareness and provide tooling to help the community develop more rigorous
and reliable datasets going forward. All scripts necessary to reproduce our
audit and the baseline implementation are available at:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扭矩的分层重连策略，通过动态调整消息传递来提升异质图和噪声图中的表示学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图神经网络（GNNs）在图结构数据中学习时，原生交互可能不利于信息传递，因此需要开发图重连方法。

Method: 定义了一种干扰感知的扭矩度量，结合结构距离和能量分数，量化边引起的扰动，并据此分层重构每层的感受野。

Result: 在基准数据集上，该方法在异质图和同质图上均优于现有方法，并在噪声图上保持高准确率。

Conclusion: 扭矩驱动的分层重连策略有效提升了GNNs在异质图和噪声图中的性能。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for learning from
graph-structured data, leveraging message passing to diffuse information and
update node representations. However, most efforts have suggested that native
interactions encoded in the graph may not be friendly for this process,
motivating the development of graph rewiring methods. In this work, we propose
a torque-driven hierarchical rewiring strategy, inspired by the notion of
torque in classical mechanics, dynamically modulating message passing to
improve representation learning in heterophilous graphs and enhance robustness
against noisy graphs. Specifically, we define an interference-aware torque
metric that integrates structural distance and energy scores to quantify the
perturbation induced by edges, thereby encouraging each node to aggregate
information from its nearest low-energy neighbors. We use the metric to
hierarchically reconfigure the receptive field of each layer by judiciously
pruning high-torque edges and adding low-torque links, suppressing propagation
noise and boosting pertinent signals. Extensive evaluations on benchmark
datasets show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods on both
heterophilous and homophilous graphs, and maintains high accuracy on noisy
graph.

TL;DR: MemShare是一种新型的KV缓存管理方法，通过重用高度相似的中间推理步骤的KV缓存块，显著减少内存开销并提高吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）在推理过程中生成冗长的思维链序列，导致内存开销过大，且中间推理步骤高度相似。

Method: 提出MemShare，采用协同过滤算法识别可重用的KV缓存块，并实现零拷贝缓存重用。

Result: 实验结果显示，MemShare在保持准确性的同时，吞吐量提升高达84.79%。

Conclusion: MemShare通过高效的KV缓存管理，显著优化了LRMs的内存和性能表现。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved significant advances in
mathematical reasoning and formal logic tasks. However, their tendency to
generate lengthy chain-of-thought sequences leads to substantial memory
overhead during inference. We observe that LRMs frequently produce highly
similar intermediate reasoning steps, which correspond to similar KV cache
states across layers. Motivated by this observation, we propose MemShare, a
novel KV cache management approach that effectively reduces memory overhead.
MemShare employs a collaborative filtering algorithm to efficiently identify
reusable KV cache blocks and enables zero copy cache reuse to significantly
reduce memory overhead, improve throughput while maintaining accuracy.
Experimental results demonstrate that MemShare delivers up to 84.79\%
improvement in throughput while maintaining better accuracy compared to
existing KV cache management methods.

TL;DR: 提出了两种新框架PVD-Net和PVD-ONet，用于解决传统物理信息神经网络在奇异扰动问题中的收敛问题，无需数据依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统物理信息神经网络在奇异扰动问题中难以收敛，需要新的方法解决这一问题。

Method: PVD-Net采用两网络架构（稳定性优先）或五网络架构（高精度优先），结合Prandtl或Van Dyke匹配条件；PVD-ONet通过组合多个DeepONet模块实现算子学习。

Result: 数值实验表明，新方法在各种误差指标下均优于现有基线。

Conclusion: PVD-Net和PVD-ONet为多尺度问题提供了高效的新解决方案。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks and Physics-informed DeepONet excel in
solving partial differential equations; however, they often fail to converge
for singularly perturbed problems. To address this, we propose two novel
frameworks, Prandtl-Van Dyke neural network (PVD-Net) and its operator learning
extension Prandtl-Van Dyke Deep Operator Network (PVD-ONet), which rely solely
on governing equations without data. To address varying task-specific
requirements, both PVD-Net and PVD-ONet are developed in two distinct versions,
tailored respectively for stability-focused and high-accuracy modeling. The
leading-order PVD-Net adopts a two-network architecture combined with Prandtl's
matching condition, targeting stability-prioritized scenarios. The high-order
PVD-Net employs a five-network design with Van Dyke's matching principle to
capture fine-scale boundary layer structures, making it ideal for high-accuracy
scenarios. PVD-ONet generalizes PVD-Net to the operator learning setting by
assembling multiple DeepONet modules, directly mapping initial conditions to
solution operators and enabling instant predictions for an entire family of
boundary layer problems without retraining. Numerical experiments on various
models show that our proposed methods consistently outperform existing
baselines under various error metrics, thereby offering a powerful new approach
for multi-scale problems.

Abstract: Any agents we can possibly build are subject to capacity constraints, as
memory and compute resources are inherently finite. However, comparatively
little attention has been dedicated to understanding how agents with limited
capacity should allocate their resources for optimal performance. The goal of
this paper is to shed some light on this question by studying a simple yet
relevant continual learning problem: the capacity-constrained
linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) sequential prediction problem. We derive a
solution to this problem under appropriate technical conditions. Moreover, for
problems that can be decomposed into a set of sub-problems, we also demonstrate
how to optimally allocate capacity across these sub-problems in the steady
state. We view the results of this paper as a first step in the systematic
theoretical study of learning under capacity constraints.

TL;DR: Latte框架通过本地和外部内存存储历史测试数据，提升去中心化环境下的测试时适应性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有测试时适应方法在去中心化环境中因数据有限或共享单一全局内存导致个性化不足的问题。

Method: 每个客户端维护本地和外部内存，通过服务器协调检索相似客户端的原型数据，结合嵌入相似性和不确定性进行本地适应。

Result: 理论分析和实验验证表明，Latte在去中心化环境中性能优越，且通信和计算成本极低。

Conclusion: Latte有效解决了去中心化环境中的测试时适应问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation with pre-trained vision-language models has gained
increasing attention for addressing distribution shifts during testing. Among
these approaches, memory-based algorithms stand out due to their training-free
nature and ability to leverage historical test data. However, existing
test-time adaptation methods are typically designed for a single domain with
abundant data. In decentralized settings such as federated learning, applying
these methods individually to each client suffers from limited test data, while
directly sharing a single global memory via the server prevents proper
personalization to each client's unique distribution. To address this, we
propose Latte, a novel framework where each client maintains a local memory to
store embeddings from its own historical test data and an external memory to
store class prototypes from other relevant clients. During communication, each
client retrieves prototypes from similar clients under the server's
coordination to expand its memory. For local adaptation, Latte utilizes both
embedding similarity and uncertainty to enhance model performance. Our
theoretical analysis shows that Latte effectively leverages in-distribution
clients while remaining robust to out-of-distribution clients. Extensive
experiments on domain adaptation and corruption benchmarks validate that Latte
achieves superior performance in decentralized settings, while introducing only
negligible communication and computation costs. Our code is available at

Abstract: The rise of LLM-based agents has opened new frontiers in AI applications, yet
evaluating these agents remains a complex and underdeveloped area. This survey
provides an in-depth overview of the emerging field of LLM agent evaluation,
introducing a two-dimensional taxonomy that organizes existing work along (1)

capabilities, reliability, and safety -- and (2) evaluation process -- how to
evaluate, including interaction modes, datasets and benchmarks, metric
computation methods, and tooling. In addition to taxonomy, we highlight
enterprise-specific challenges, such as role-based access to data, the need for
reliability guarantees, dynamic and long-horizon interactions, and compliance,
which are often overlooked in current research. We also identify future
research directions, including holistic, more realistic, and scalable
evaluation. This work aims to bring clarity to the fragmented landscape of
agent evaluation and provide a framework for systematic assessment, enabling
researchers and practitioners to evaluate LLM agents for real-world deployment.

Result: 模型在合成数据和神经记录上验证了其准确恢复流形结构的能力，且计算成本随数据长度线性增长。

Conclusion: 该模型在计算效率和可解释性上优于现有方法，适用于复杂时间序列建模。

Abstract: The manifold hypothesis suggests that high-dimensional neural time series lie
on a low-dimensional manifold shaped by simpler underlying dynamics. To uncover
this structure, latent dynamical variable models such as state-space models,
recurrent neural networks, neural ordinary differential equations, and Gaussian
Process Latent Variable Models are widely used. We propose a novel hierarchical
stochastic differential equation (SDE) model that balances computational
efficiency and interpretability, addressing key limitations of existing
methods. Our model assumes the trajectory of a manifold can be reconstructed
from a sparse set of samples from the manifold trajectory. The latent space is
modeled using Brownian bridge SDEs, with points - specified in both time and
value - sampled from a multivariate marked point process. These Brownian
bridges define the drift of a second set of SDEs, which are then mapped to the
observed data. This yields a continuous, differentiable latent process capable
of modeling arbitrarily complex time series as the number of manifold points
increases. We derive training and inference procedures and show that the
computational cost of inference scales linearly with the length of the
observation data. We then validate our model on both synthetic data and neural
recordings to demonstrate that it accurately recovers the underlying manifold
structure and scales effectively with data dimensionality.

Motivation: 研究为何简单的分类概率分布输出在神经时间点过程模型中未被广泛使用，并探索现有数据集是否揭示了事件生成过程的足够信息。

Method: 通过扩展和创建新数据集，比较简单分类分布输出与现有模型的性能。

Result: 发现简单分类分布输出在多种数据集上表现优异，且现有模型的性能可能源于正则化效应和输出结构的限制。

Conclusion: 简单分类分布输出在神经时间点过程模型中具有竞争力，尤其在信息丰富的数据集上表现突出。

Abstract: We demonstrate the effectiveness of using a simple neural network output, a
categorical probability distribution, for the task of next spike prediction.
This case study motivates an investigation into why this simple output
structure is not commonly used with neural temporal point process models. We
find evidence that many existing datasets for evaluating temporal point process
models do not reveal much information about the underlying event generating
processes, and many existing models perform well due to regularization effects
of model size and constraints on output structure. We extend existing datasets
and create new ones in order to explore outside of this information limited
regime and find that outputting a simple categorical distribution is
competitive across a wide range of datasets.

Abstract: Current approaches to genomic sequence modeling often struggle to align the
inductive biases of machine learning models with the evolutionarily-informed
structure of biological systems. To this end, we formulate a novel application
of hyperbolic CNNs that exploits this structure, enabling more expressive DNA
sequence representations. Our strategy circumvents the need for explicit
phylogenetic mapping while discerning key properties of sequences pertaining to
core functional and regulatory behavior. Across 37 out of 42 genome
interpretation benchmark datasets, our hyperbolic models outperform their
Euclidean equivalents. Notably, our approach even surpasses state-of-the-art
performance on seven GUE benchmark datasets, consistently outperforming many
DNA language models while using orders of magnitude fewer parameters and
avoiding pretraining. Our results include a novel set of benchmark
datasets--the Transposable Elements Benchmark--which explores a major but
understudied component of the genome with deep evolutionary significance. We
further motivate our work by exploring how our hyperbolic models recognize
genomic signal under various data-generating conditions and by constructing an
empirical method for interpreting the hyperbolicity of dataset embeddings.
Throughout these assessments, we find persistent evidence highlighting the
potential of our hyperbolic framework as a robust paradigm for genome
representation learning. Our code and benchmark datasets are available at

Result: 实验表明，DGP在可控的token预算内，将欺诈检测性能提升至多6.8%（AUPRC）。

Conclusion: DGP展示了图增强LLM在欺诈检测中的潜力，有效解决了信息过载问题。

Abstract: Real-world fraud detection applications benefit from graph learning
techniques that jointly exploit node features, often rich in textual data, and
graph structural information. Recently, Graph-Enhanced LLMs emerge as a
promising graph learning approach that converts graph information into prompts,
exploiting LLMs' ability to reason over both textual and structural
information. Among them, text-only prompting, which converts graph information
to prompts consisting solely of text tokens, offers a solution that relies only
on LLM tuning without requiring additional graph-specific encoders. However,
text-only prompting struggles on heterogeneous fraud-detection graphs:
multi-hop relations expand exponentially with each additional hop, leading to
rapidly growing neighborhoods associated with dense textual information. These
neighborhoods may overwhelm the model with long, irrelevant content in the
prompt and suppress key signals from the target node, thereby degrading
performance. To address this challenge, we propose Dual Granularity Prompting
(DGP), which mitigates information overload by preserving fine-grained textual
details for the target node while summarizing neighbor information into
coarse-grained text prompts. DGP introduces tailored summarization strategies
for different data modalities, bi-level semantic abstraction for textual fields
and statistical aggregation for numerical features, enabling effective
compression of verbose neighbor content into concise, informative prompts.
Experiments across public and industrial datasets demonstrate that DGP operates
within a manageable token budget while improving fraud detection performance by
up to 6.8% (AUPRC) over state-of-the-art methods, showing the potential of
Graph-Enhanced LLMs for fraud detection.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) is often viewed as a powerful data analysis tool that
is easy to learn because of its black-box nature. Yet this very nature also
makes it difficult to quantify confidence in predictions extracted from ML
models, and more fundamentally, to understand how such models are mathematical
abstractions of training data. The goal of this paper is to unravel these
issues and their connections to uncertainty quantification (UQ) by pursuing a
line of reasoning motivated by diagnostics. In such settings, prevalence - i.e.
the fraction of elements in class - is often of inherent interest. Here we
analyze the many interpretations of prevalence to derive a level-set theory of
classification, which shows that certain types of self-consistent ML models are
equivalent to class-conditional probability distributions. We begin by studying
the properties of binary Bayes optimal classifiers, recognizing that their
boundary sets can be reinterpreted as level-sets of pairwise density ratios. By
parameterizing Bayes classifiers in terms of the prevalence, we then show that
they satisfy important monotonicity and class-switching properties that can be
used to deduce the density ratios without direct access to the boundary sets.
Moreover, this information is sufficient for tasks such as constructing the
multiclass Bayes-optimal classifier and estimating inherent uncertainty in the
class assignments. In the multiclass case, we use these results to deduce
normalization and self-consistency conditions, the latter being equivalent to
the law of total probability for classifiers. We also show that these are
necessary conditions for arbitrary ML models to have valid probabilistic
interpretations. Throughout we demonstrate how this analysis informs the
broader task of UQ for ML via an uncertainty propagation framework.

Abstract: Accurately forecasting commodity demand remains a critical challenge due to
volatile market dynamics, nonlinear dependencies, and the need for economically
consistent predictions. This paper introduces PREIG, a novel deep learning
framework tailored for commodity demand forecasting. The model uniquely
integrates a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) architecture with physics-informed
neural network (PINN) principles by embedding a domain-specific economic
constraint: the negative elasticity between price and demand. This constraint
is enforced through a customized loss function that penalizes violations of the
physical rule, ensuring that model predictions remain interpretable and aligned
with economic theory. To further enhance predictive performance and stability,
PREIG incorporates a hybrid optimization strategy that couples NAdam and L-BFGS
with Population-Based Training (POP). Experiments across multiple commodities
datasets demonstrate that PREIG significantly outperforms traditional
econometric models (ARIMA,GARCH) and deep learning baselines (BPNN,RNN) in both
RMSE and MAPE. When compared with GRU,PREIG maintains good explainability while
still performing well in prediction. By bridging domain knowledge, optimization
theory and deep learning, PREIG provides a robust, interpretable, and scalable
solution for high-dimensional nonlinear time series forecasting in economy.

Abstract: Hydrofluoroolefins are considered the most promising next-generation
refrigerants due to their extremely low global warming potential values, which
can effectively mitigate the global warming effect. However, the lack of
reliable thermodynamic data hinders the discovery and application of newer and
superior hydrofluoroolefin refrigerants. In this work, integrating the
strengths of theoretical method and data-driven method, we proposed a neural
network extended corresponding state model to predict the residual
thermodynamic properties of hydrofluoroolefin refrigerants. The innovation is
that the fluids are characterized through their microscopic molecular
structures by the inclusion of graph neural network module and the specialized
design of model architecture to enhance its generalization ability. The
proposed model is trained using the highly accurate data of available known
fluids, and evaluated via the leave-one-out cross-validation method. Compared
to conventional extended corresponding state models or cubic equation of state,
the proposed model shows significantly improved accuracy for density and energy
properties in liquid and supercritical regions, with average absolute deviation
of 1.49% (liquid) and 2.42% (supercritical) for density, 3.37% and 2.50% for
residual entropy, 1.85% and 1.34% for residual enthalpy. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of embedding physics knowledge into the machine
learning model. The proposed neural network extended corresponding state model
is expected to significantly accelerate the discovery of novel
hydrofluoroolefin refrigerants.

Result: 实验证明ZS-PAG在多种基准测试中优于基线方法，且具有理论保证。

Conclusion: ZS-PAG在零样本遗忘场景中有效解决了过遗忘问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove the influence of specific samples from a
trained model. A key challenge in this process is over-unlearning, where the
model's performance on the remaining data significantly drops due to the change
in the model's parameters. Existing unlearning algorithms depend on the
remaining data to prevent this issue. As such, these methods are inapplicable
in a more practical scenario, where only the unlearning samples are available
(i.e., zero-shot unlearning). This paper presents a novel framework, ZS-PAG, to
fill this gap. Our approach offers three key innovations: (1) we approximate
the inaccessible remaining data by generating adversarial samples; (2)
leveraging the generated samples, we pinpoint a specific subspace to perform
the unlearning process, therefore preventing over-unlearning in the challenging
zero-shot scenario; and (3) we consider the influence of the unlearning process
on the remaining samples and design an influence-based pseudo-labeling
strategy. As a result, our method further improves the model's performance
after unlearning. The proposed method holds a theoretical guarantee, and
experiments on various benchmarks validate the effectiveness and superiority of
our proposed method over several baselines.

voxel-based approach that integrates segmented 3D microscopy data, physical

Motivation: 逆合成规划在分子发现中仍是一个核心挑战，传统方法存在可扩展性差和泛化能力有限的问题，而模板无关的生成方法可能产生无效反应。

Method: TempRe将基于模板的方法重新设计为序列生成框架，实现了可扩展、灵活且化学合理的逆合成。

Conclusion: 模板生成建模在计算机辅助合成规划中具有潜力，TempRe为多步合成路线生成提供了轻量高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Retrosynthesis planning remains a central challenge in molecular discovery
due to the vast and complex chemical reaction space. While traditional
template-based methods offer tractability, they suffer from poor scalability
and limited generalization, and template-free generative approaches risk
generating invalid reactions. In this work, we propose TempRe, a generative
framework that reformulates template-based approaches as sequence generation,
enabling scalable, flexible, and chemically plausible retrosynthesis. We
evaluated TempRe across single-step and multi-step retrosynthesis tasks,
demonstrating its superiority over both template classification and
SMILES-based generation methods. On the PaRoutes multi-step benchmark, TempRe
achieves strong top-k route accuracy. Furthermore, we extend TempRe to direct
multi-step synthesis route generation, providing a lightweight and efficient
alternative to conventional single-step and search-based approaches. These
results highlight the potential of template generative modeling as a powerful
paradigm in computer-aided synthesis planning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度无线传感（DWS）模型多为黑盒，缺乏可解释性，限制了其通用性和安全性。

Method: 通过非平凡理论推导，将实值白盒Transformer扩展到复数域，构建了完全复数值的白盒Transformer，并引入子空间正则化以增强特征多样性。

Result: RF-CRATE在多个传感任务中平均性能提升19.98%，分类增益5.08%，回归误差减少10.34%。

Conclusion: RF-CRATE在保持高性能的同时实现了完全的可解释性，为RF传感领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: The empirical success of deep learning has spurred its application to the
radio-frequency (RF) domain, leading to significant advances in Deep Wireless
Sensing (DWS). However, most existing DWS models function as black boxes with
limited interpretability, which hampers their generalizability and raises
concerns in security-sensitive physical applications. In this work, inspired by
the remarkable advances of white-box transformers, we present RF-CRATE, the
first mathematically interpretable deep network architecture for RF sensing,
grounded in the principles of complex sparse rate reduction. To accommodate the
unique RF signals, we conduct non-trivial theoretical derivations that extend
the original real-valued white-box transformer to the complex domain. By
leveraging the CR-Calculus framework, we successfully construct a fully
complex-valued white-box transformer with theoretically derived self-attention
and residual multi-layer perceptron modules. Furthermore, to improve the
model's ability to extract discriminative features from limited wireless data,
we introduce Subspace Regularization, a novel regularization strategy that
enhances feature diversity, resulting in an average performance improvement of
19.98% across multiple sensing tasks. We extensively evaluate RF-CRATE against
seven baselines with multiple public and self-collected datasets involving
different RF signals. The results show that RF-CRATE achieves performance on
par with thoroughly engineered black-box models, while offering full
mathematical interpretability. More importantly, by extending CRATE to the
complex domain, RF-CRATE yields substantial improvements, achieving an average
classification gain of 5.08% and reducing regression error by 10.34% across
diverse sensing tasks compared to CRATE. RF-CRATE is fully open-sourced at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CCS技术对可持续发展至关重要，但需要优化决策变量以提高其经济性和可持续性。本文旨在探索贝叶斯优化在CCS项目中的应用潜力。

Method: 采用贝叶斯优化框架，比较高斯过程（GPs）与其他新型随机模型在决策变量多或目标函数尺度不同的情况下的表现。

Result: 研究表明，在GPs表现不佳的场景下，其他随机模型可能更有效，同时通过净现值（NPV）验证了框架的经济可行性。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯优化在CCS项目中有潜力成为提升可持续性的优选方法，特别是在需要复杂决策的场景中。

Abstract: Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) stands as a pivotal technology for fostering
a sustainable future. The process, which involves injecting supercritical
CO$_2$ into underground formations, a method already widely used for Enhanced
Oil Recovery, serves a dual purpose: it not only curbs CO$_2$ emissions and
addresses climate change but also extends the operational lifespan and
sustainability of oil fields and platforms, easing the shift toward greener
practices. This paper delivers a thorough comparative evaluation of strategies
for optimizing decision variables in CCS project development, employing a
derivative-free technique known as Bayesian Optimization. In addition to
Gaussian Processes, which usually serve as the gold standard in BO, various
novel stochastic models were examined and compared within a BO framework. This
research investigates the effectiveness of utilizing more exotic stochastic
models than GPs for BO in environments where GPs have been shown to
underperform, such as in cases with a large number of decision variables or
multiple objective functions that are not similarly scaled. By incorporating
Net Present Value (NPV) as a key objective function, the proposed framework
demonstrates its potential to improve economic viability while ensuring the
sustainable deployment of CCS technologies. Ultimately, this study represents
the first application in the reservoir engineering industry of the growing body
of BO research, specifically in the search for more appropriate stochastic
models, highlighting its potential as a preferred method for enhancing
sustainability in the energy sector.

Motivation: FNOs作为高维偏微分方程的替代模型，其稳定性、泛化性和频率行为缺乏理论解释。

Method: 采用有效场论分析，推导层核和四点顶点的闭合递推关系，研究解析激活、尺度不变性和残差连接三种情况。

Result: 非线性激活导致频率输入耦合高频模式，实验验证了频率转移；宽网络下提出权重初始化的临界条件。

Conclusion: 非线性使FNOs能捕捉非平凡特征，尺度不变激活和残差连接增强特征学习。

Abstract: Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) have emerged as leading surrogates for
high-dimensional partial-differential equations, yet their stability,
generalization and frequency behavior lack a principled explanation. We present
the first systematic effective-field-theory analysis of FNOs in an
infinite-dimensional function space, deriving closed recursion relations for
the layer kernel and four-point vertex and then examining three practically
important settings-analytic activations, scale-invariant cases and
architectures with residual connections. The theory shows that nonlinear
activations inevitably couple frequency inputs to high-frequency modes that are
otherwise discarded by spectral truncation, and experiments confirm this
frequency transfer. For wide networks we obtain explicit criticality conditions
on the weight-initialization ensemble that keep small input perturbations to
have uniform scale across depth, and empirical tests validate these
predictions. Taken together, our results quantify how nonlinearity enables
neural operators to capture non-trivial features, supply criteria for
hyper-parameter selection via criticality analysis, and explain why
scale-invariant activations and residual connections enhance feature learning
in FNOs.

Result: 方法能高精度发现ODE，无需正则化即可稀疏解，对噪声数据鲁棒。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于真实实验环境，推动数据驱动技术在物理现象学习中的应用。

Abstract: The data-driven discovery of interpretable models approximating the
underlying dynamics of a physical system has gained attraction in the past
decade. Current approaches employ pre-specified functional forms or basis
functions and often result in models that lack physical meaning and
interpretability, let alone represent the true physics of the system. We
propose an unsupervised parameter estimation methodology that first finds an
approximate general solution, followed by a spline transformation to linearly
estimate the coefficients of the governing ordinary differential equation
(ODE). The approximate general solution is postulated using the same functional
form as the analytical solution of a general homogeneous, linear,
constant-coefficient ODE. An added advantage is its ability to produce a
high-fidelity, smooth functional form even in the presence of noisy data. The
spline approximation obtains gradient information from the functional form
which are linearly independent and creates the basis of the gradient matrix.
This gradient matrix is used in a linear system to find the coefficients of the
ODEs. From the case studies, we observed that our modeling approach discovers
ODEs with high accuracy and also promotes sparsity in the solution without
using any regularization techniques. The methodology is also robust to noisy
data and thus allows the integration of data-driven techniques into real
experimental setting for data-driven learning of physical phenomena.

Abstract: Structural biology has long been dominated by the one sequence, one

Abstract: Cloud computing offers on-demand resource access, regulated by Service-Level
Agreements (SLAs) between consumers and Cloud Service Providers (CSPs). SLA
violations can impact efficiency and CSP profitability. In this work, we
propose an SLA-aware automated algorithm-selection framework for combinatorial
optimization problems in resource-constrained cloud environments. The framework
uses an ensemble of machine learning models to predict performance and rank

features along with memory usage, runtime, and optimality gap for 6 algorithms.
As an empirical benchmark, we evaluate the framework on both classification and

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: R-Stitch是一种基于置信度的混合解码框架，通过在小语言模型（SLM）和大语言模型（LLM）之间动态切换，显著加速链式思维推理（CoT），同时保持答案质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CoT推理方法因依赖长序列自回归解码而计算开销大，且现有加速策略（如推测解码）在小模型和大模型一致性低时效果有限。

Method: R-Stitch采用基于置信度的混合解码，默认使用SLM生成令牌，仅在SLM置信度低于阈值时调用LLM，避免全序列回滚。

Result: 实验表明，R-Stitch在数学推理基准上实现了高达85%的推理延迟降低，且准确率下降可忽略。

Conclusion: R-Stitch是一种无需训练、模型无关的CoT推理加速方法，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning enhances the problem-solving capabilities of
large language models by encouraging step-by-step intermediate reasoning during
inference. While effective, CoT introduces substantial computational overhead
due to its reliance on autoregressive decoding over long token sequences.
Existing acceleration strategies either reduce sequence length through early
stopping or compressive reward designs, or improve decoding speed via
speculative decoding with smaller models. However, speculative decoding suffers
from limited speedup when the agreement between small and large models is low,
and fails to exploit the potential advantages of small models in producing
concise intermediate reasoning. In this paper, we present R-Stitch, a
token-level, confidence-based hybrid decoding framework that accelerates CoT
inference by switching between a small language model (SLM) and a large
language model (LLM) along the reasoning trajectory. R-Stitch uses the SLM to
generate tokens by default and delegates to the LLM only when the SLM's
confidence falls below a threshold. This design avoids full-sequence rollback
and selectively invokes the LLM on uncertain steps, preserving both efficiency
and answer quality. R-Stitch is model-agnostic, training-free, and compatible
with standard decoding pipelines. Experiments on math reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that R-Stitch achieves up to 85\% reduction in inference latency
with negligible accuracy drop, highlighting its practical effectiveness in
accelerating CoT reasoning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究RL在LLMs后训练中的经济价值，填补这一领域的量化空白。

Method: 提出RLPF方法，利用历史广告表现数据作为奖励信号，训练LLMs生成广告文本。

Result: 在10周A/B测试中，AdLlama将点击率提升6.7%，广告主满意度提高。

Conclusion: RLPF是一种有前景的后训练方法，能有效连接语言模型与实际业务成果。

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI), in particular large language models
(LLMs), is poised to drive transformative economic change. LLMs are pre-trained
on vast text data to learn general language patterns, but a subsequent
post-training phase is critical to align them for specific real-world tasks.
Reinforcement learning (RL) is the leading post-training technique, yet its
economic impact remains largely underexplored and unquantified. We examine this
question through the lens of the first deployment of an RL-trained LLM for
generative advertising on Facebook. Integrated into Meta's Text Generation
feature, our model, "AdLlama," powers an AI tool that helps advertisers create
new variations of human-written ad text. To train this model, we introduce
reinforcement learning with performance feedback (RLPF), a post-training method
that uses historical ad performance data as a reward signal. In a large-scale
10-week A/B test on Facebook spanning nearly 35,000 advertisers and 640,000 ad
variations, we find that AdLlama improves click-through rates by 6.7%
(p=0.0296) compared to a supervised imitation model trained on curated ads.
This represents a substantial improvement in advertiser return on investment on
Facebook. We also find that advertisers who used AdLlama generated more ad
variations, indicating higher satisfaction with the model's outputs. To our
knowledge, this is the largest study to date on the use of generative AI in an
ecologically valid setting, offering an important data point quantifying the
tangible impact of RL post-training. Furthermore, the results show that RLPF is
a promising and generalizable approach for metric-driven post-training that
bridges the gap between highly capable language models and tangible outcomes.

Result: 学生模型生成的对抗样本攻击成功率与集成方法相当，但生成时间减少六倍。硬标签监督和低温设置显著提升迁移性。

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏不仅能压缩模型，还能高效提升黑盒对抗攻击的效果。

Abstract: We investigate whether knowledge distillation (KD) from multiple
heterogeneous teacher models can enhance the generation of transferable
adversarial examples. A lightweight student model is trained using two KD
strategies: curriculum-based switching and joint optimization, with ResNet50
and DenseNet-161 as teachers. The trained student is then used to generate
adversarial examples using FG, FGS, and PGD attacks, which are evaluated
against a black-box target model (GoogLeNet). Our results show that student
models distilled from multiple teachers achieve attack success rates comparable
to ensemble-based baselines, while reducing adversarial example generation time
by up to a factor of six. An ablation study further reveals that lower
temperature settings and the inclusion of hard-label supervision significantly
enhance transferability. These findings suggest that KD can serve not only as a
model compression technique but also as a powerful tool for improving the
efficiency and effectiveness of black-box adversarial attacks.

Abstract: This paper proposes a machine learning-based approach for identifying honey
floral and geographical sources using mineral element profiles. The proposed
method comprises two steps: preprocessing and classification. The preprocessing
phase involves missing-value treatment and data normalization. In the
classification phase, we employ various supervised classification models for
discriminating between six botanical sources and 13 geographical origins of
honey. We test the classifiers' performance on a publicly available honey
mineral element dataset. The dataset contains mineral element profiles of
honeys from various floral and geographical origins. Results show that mineral
element content in honey provides discriminative information useful for
classifying honey botanical and geographical sources. Results also show that
the Random Forests (RF) classifier obtains the best performance on this
dataset, achieving a cross-validation accuracy of 99.30% for classifying honey
botanical origins and 98.01% for classifying honey geographical origins.

Conclusion: DRL在库存管理中有效结合数据驱动和分析方法，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: This paper investigates the application of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)
to classical inventory management problems, with a focus on practical
implementation considerations. We apply a DRL algorithm based on DirectBackprop
to several fundamental inventory management scenarios including multi-period
systems with lost sales (with and without lead times), perishable inventory
management, dual sourcing, and joint inventory procurement and removal. The DRL
approach learns policies across products using only historical information that
would be available in practice, avoiding unrealistic assumptions about demand
distributions or access to distribution parameters. We demonstrate that our
generic DRL implementation performs competitively against or outperforms
established benchmarks and heuristics across these diverse settings, while
requiring minimal parameter tuning. Through examination of the learned
policies, we show that the DRL approach naturally captures many known
structural properties of optimal policies derived from traditional operations
research methods. To further improve policy performance and interpretability,
we propose a Structure-Informed Policy Network technique that explicitly
incorporates analytically-derived characteristics of optimal policies into the
learning process. This approach can help interpretability and add robustness to
the policy in out-of-sample performance, as we demonstrate in an example with
realistic demand data. Finally, we provide an illustrative application of DRL
in a non-stationary setting. Our work bridges the gap between data-driven
learning and analytical insights in inventory management while maintaining
practical applicability.

expressive yet stable time-varying weights, particularly under computational
constraints. This work investigates weight parameterization strategies that
constrain the temporal evolution of weights to a low-dimensional subspace
spanned by polynomial basis functions. We evaluate both monomial and Legendre
polynomial bases within neural ODE and residual network (ResNet) architectures
under discretize-then-optimize and optimize-then-discretize training paradigms.
Experimental results across three high-dimensional benchmark problems show that
Legendre parameterizations yield more stable training dynamics, reduce
computational cost, and achieve accuracy comparable to or better than both
monomial parameterizations and unconstrained weight models. These findings
elucidate the role of basis choice in time-dependent weight parameterization
and demonstrate that using orthogonal polynomial bases offers a favorable
tradeoff between model expressivity and training efficiency.

*Wei Yang,Defu Cao,Yan Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一的集成框架，结合层次集成和架构集成策略，提升基础模型在供应链销售预测中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 供应链需求预测面临层次复杂性、领域转移和外部因素变化等挑战，现有基础模型在分布变化下表现不佳。

Method: 采用层次集成（HE）和架构集成（AE）策略，分别捕捉局部模式和整合多样化模型预测。

Result: 在M5基准和三个外部销售数据集上表现优于基线，提升了跨层次预测准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂预测环境中的泛化提升提供了简单有效的机制。

Abstract: Accurate demand forecasting is critical for supply chain optimization, yet
remains difficult in practice due to hierarchical complexity, domain shifts,
and evolving external factors. While recent foundation models offer strong
potential for time series forecasting, they often suffer from architectural
rigidity and limited robustness under distributional change. In this paper, we
propose a unified ensemble framework that enhances the performance of
foundation models for sales forecasting in real-world supply chains. Our method
combines two complementary strategies: (1) Hierarchical Ensemble (HE), which
partitions training and inference by semantic levels (e.g., store, category,
department) to capture localized patterns; and (2) Architectural Ensemble (AE),
which integrates predictions from diverse model backbones to mitigate bias and
improve stability. We conduct extensive experiments on the M5 benchmark and
three external sales datasets, covering both in-domain and zero-shot
forecasting. Results show that our approach consistently outperforms strong
baselines, improves accuracy across hierarchical levels, and provides a simple
yet effective mechanism for boosting generalization in complex forecasting
environments.

TL;DR: iHOMER是一种在线多标签学习框架，通过动态聚类和漂移检测机制，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多标签数据流中的分布演变、高维标签空间和复杂依赖关系增加了模型适应的难度。

Method: iHOMER通过在线聚类和树状学习器动态分区标签空间，并集成漂移检测机制。

Result: 在23个数据集上，iHOMER比5种全局基线方法提升23%，比12种局部基线方法提升32%。

Conclusion: iHOMER在在线多标签分类中表现出色，具有鲁棒性和适应性。

Abstract: Mining data streams with multi-label outputs poses significant challenges due
to evolving distributions, high-dimensional label spaces, sparse label
occurrences, and complex label dependencies. Moreover, concept drift affects
not only input distributions but also label correlations and imbalance ratios
over time, complicating model adaptation. To address these challenges,
structured learners are categorized into local and global methods. Local
methods break down the task into simpler components, while global methods adapt
the algorithm to the full output space, potentially yielding better predictions
by exploiting label correlations. This work introduces iHOMER (Incremental
Hierarchy Of Multi-label Classifiers), an online multi-label learning framework
that incrementally partitions the label space into disjoint, correlated
clusters without relying on predefined hierarchies. iHOMER leverages online
divisive-agglomerative clustering based on \textit{Jaccard} similarity and a
global tree-based learner driven by a multivariate \textit{Bernoulli} process
to guide instance partitioning. To address non-stationarity, it integrates
drift detection mechanisms at both global and local levels, enabling dynamic
restructuring of label partitions and subtrees. Experiments across 23
real-world datasets show iHOMER outperforms 5 state-of-the-art global
baselines, such as MLHAT, MLHT of Pruned Sets and iSOUPT, by 23\%, and 12 local
baselines, such as binary relevance transformations of kNN, EFDT, ARF, and
ADWIN bagging/boosting ensembles, by 32\%, establishing its robustness for
online multi-label classification.

Motivation: 现有模拟方法难以捕捉私人驾驶员的适应性行为和长距离充电需求。

Method: 多阶段强化学习框架，模拟大地理范围内的EV充电行为。

Result: 模型验证成功，识别出充电荒漠，并反映政策转向快速充电枢纽。

Conclusion: 框架有效模拟私人驾驶员行为，为政策制定提供依据。

Abstract: Despite the rapid expansion of electric vehicle (EV) charging networks,
questions remain about their efficiency in meeting the growing needs of EV
drivers. Previous simulation-based approaches, which rely on static behavioural
rules, have struggled to capture the adaptive behaviours of human drivers.
Although reinforcement learning has been introduced in EV simulation studies,
its application has primarily focused on optimising fleet operations rather
than modelling private drivers who make independent charging decisions.
Additionally, long-distance travel remains a primary concern for EV drivers.
However, existing simulation studies rarely explore charging behaviour over
large geographical scales. To address these gaps, we propose a multi-stage
reinforcement learning framework that simulates EV charging demand across large
geographical areas. We validate the model against real-world data, and identify
the training stage that most closely reflects actual driver behaviour, which
captures both the adaptive behaviours and bounded rationality of private
drivers. Based on the simulation results, we also identify critical 'charging
deserts' where EV drivers consistently have low state of charge. Our findings
also highlight recent policy shifts toward expanding rapid charging hubs along
motorway corridors and city boundaries to meet the demand from long-distance
trips.

Conclusion: 算法设计对在线信息暴露有重要影响，基于代理的建模能提供对虚假信息传播的实用见解。

Abstract: This study uses agent-based modeling to examine the impact of various
recommendation algorithms on the propagation of misinformation on online social
networks. We simulate a synthetic environment consisting of heterogeneous
agents, including regular users, bots, and influencers, interacting through a
social network with recommendation systems. We evaluate four recommendation
strategies: popularity-based, collaborative filtering, and content-based
filtering, along with a random baseline. Our results show that
popularity-driven algorithms significantly amplify misinformation, while
item-based collaborative filtering and content-based approaches are more
effective in limiting exposure to fake content. Item-based collaborative
filtering was found to perform better than previously reported in related
literature. These findings highlight the role of algorithm design in shaping
online information exposure and show that agent-based modeling can be used to
gain realistic insight into how misinformation spreads.

Abstract: Recently, the field of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) has gained popularity as
researchers are trying to develop artificial intelligence capable of efficient
collective reasoning. Agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well
in isolated tasks, yet struggle with higher-order cognition required for
adaptive collaboration. Human teams achieve synergy not only through knowledge
sharing, but also through recursive reasoning, structured critique, and the
ability to infer others' mental states. Current artificial systems lack these
essential mechanisms, limiting their ability to engage in sophisticated
collective reasoning. This work explores cognitive processes that enable
effective collaboration, focusing on adaptive theory of mind (ToM) and
systematic critical evaluation. We investigate three key questions. First, how
does the ability to model others' perspectives enhance coordination and reduce
redundant reasoning? Second, to what extent does structured critique improve
reasoning quality by identifying logical gaps and mitigating biases? Third, the
interplay of these mechanisms can lead to emergent cognitive synergy, where the
collective intelligence of the system exceeds the sum of its parts. Through an
empirical case study on complex decision making, we show that the integration
of these cognitive mechanisms leads to more coherent, adaptive, and rigorous
agent interactions. This article contributes to the field of cognitive science
and AI research by presenting a structured framework that emulates human-like
collaborative reasoning MAS. It highlights the significance of dynamic ToM and
critical evaluation in advancing multi-agent systems' ability to tackle
complex, real-world challenges.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型的发展，如何验证其在模拟人类社交行为中的有效性成为关键挑战。

Method: 采用心理学文献中的社会困境范式，分两阶段验证：首先识别LLM代理在混合动机环境中重现人类行为所需的认知组件，然后用验证过的架构模拟新条件。

Conclusion: 该研究为验证生成代理模型提供了框架，并展示了其在生成人类社交行为新见解方面的潜力。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance, there is growing interest in using
them to simulate human social behavior through generative agent-based modeling
(GABM). However, validating these models remains a key challenge. We present a
systematic two-stage validation approach using social dilemma paradigms from
psychological literature, first identifying the cognitive components necessary
for LLM agents to reproduce known human behaviors in mixed-motive settings from
two landmark papers, then using the validated architecture to simulate novel
conditions. Our model comparison of different cognitive architectures shows
that both persona-based individual differences and theory of mind capabilities
are essential for replicating third-party punishment (TPP) as a costly signal
of trustworthiness. For the second study on public goods games, this
architecture is able to replicate an increase in cooperation from the spread of
reputational information through gossip. However, an additional strategic
component is necessary to replicate the additional boost in cooperation rates
in the condition that allows both ostracism and gossip. We then test novel
predictions for each paper with our validated generative agents. We find that
TPP rates significantly drop in settings where punishment is anonymous, yet a
substantial amount of TPP persists, suggesting that both reputational and
intrinsic moral motivations play a role in this behavior. For the second paper,
we introduce a novel intervention and see that open discussion periods before
rounds of the public goods game further increase contributions, allowing groups
to develop social norms for cooperation. This work provides a framework for
validating generative agent models while demonstrating their potential to
generate novel and testable insights into human social behavior.

Result: 在MELD和IEMOCAP数据集上表现优于现有方法，尤其在类别不平衡条件下。

Conclusion: Sync-TVA框架有效提升了多模态情感识别的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition (MER) is crucial for enabling emotionally
intelligent systems that perceive and respond to human emotions. However,
existing methods suffer from limited cross-modal interaction and imbalanced
contributions across modalities. To address these issues, we propose Sync-TVA,
an end-to-end graph-attention framework featuring modality-specific dynamic
enhancement and structured cross-modal fusion. Our design incorporates a
dynamic enhancement module for each modality and constructs heterogeneous
cross-modal graphs to model semantic relations across text, audio, and visual
features. A cross-attention fusion mechanism further aligns multimodal cues for
robust emotion inference. Experiments on MELD and IEMOCAP demonstrate
consistent improvements over state-of-the-art models in both accuracy and
weighted F1 score, especially under class-imbalanced conditions.

Conclusion: 提出了PC-JND数据集，支持未来JND预测和感知驱动的信号处理研究。

Abstract: The Just Noticeable Difference (JND) accounts for the minimum distortion at
which humans can perceive a difference between a pristine stimulus and its
distorted version. The JND concept has been widely applied in visual signal
processing tasks, including coding, transmission, rendering, and quality
assessment, to optimize human-centric media experiences. A point cloud is a
mainstream volumetric data representation consisting of both geometry
information and attributes (e.g. color). Point clouds are used for advanced
immersive 3D media such as Virtual Reality (VR). However, the JND
characteristics of viewing point clouds in VR have not been explored before. In
this paper, we study the point cloud-wise JND (PCJND) characteristics in a Six
Degrees of Freedom (6DoF) VR environment using a head-mounted display. Our
findings reveal that the texture PCJND of human eyes is smaller than the
geometry PCJND for most point clouds. Furthermore, we identify a correlation
between colorfulness and texture PCJND. However, there is no significant
correlation between colorfulness and the geometry PCJND, nor between the number
of points and neither the texture or geometry PCJND. To support future research
in JND prediction and perception-driven signal processing, we introduce PC-JND,
a novel point cloud-based JND dataset. This dataset will be made publicly
available to facilitate advancements in perceptual optimization for immersive
media.

Abstract: Motion compensation is a key component of video codecs. Conventional codecs
(HEVC and VVC) have carefully refined this coding step, with an important focus
on sub-pixel motion compensation. On the other hand, learned codecs achieve
sub-pixel motion compensation through simple bilinear filtering. This paper
offers to improve learned codec motion compensation by drawing inspiration from
conventional codecs. It is shown that the usage of more advanced interpolation
filters, block-based motion information and finite motion accuracy lead to
better compression performance and lower decoding complexity. Experimental
results are provided on the Cool-chic video codec, where we demonstrate a rate
decrease of more than 10% and a lowering of motion-related decoding complexity
from 391 MAC per pixel to 214 MAC per pixel. All contributions are made

Abstract: Tactile sensing plays a fundamental role in enabling robots to navigate
dynamic and unstructured environments, particularly in applications such as
delicate object manipulation, surface exploration, and human-robot interaction.
In this paper, we introduce a passive soft robotic fingertip with integrated
tactile sensing, fabricated using a 3D-printed elastomer lattice with embedded
air channels. This sensorization approach, termed fluidic innervation,
transforms the lattice into a tactile sensor by detecting pressure changes
within sealed air channels, providing a simple yet robust solution to tactile
sensing in robotics. Unlike conventional methods that rely on complex materials
or designs, fluidic innervation offers a simple, scalable, single-material
fabrication process. We characterize the sensors' response, develop a geometric
model to estimate tip displacement, and train a neural network to accurately
predict contact location and contact force. Additionally, we integrate the
fingertip with an admittance controller to emulate spring-like behavior,
demonstrate its capability for environment exploration through tactile
feedback, and validate its durability under high impact and cyclic loading
conditions. This tactile sensing technique offers advantages in terms of
simplicity, adaptability, and durability and opens up new opportunities for
versatile robotic manipulation.

Conclusion: 该方法为低成本陀螺仪在自主平台中的导航提供了更准确和鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: An accurate initial heading angle is essential for efficient and safe
navigation across diverse domains. Unlike magnetometers, gyroscopes can provide
accurate heading reference independent of the magnetic disturbances in a
process known as gyrocompassing. Yet, accurate and timely gyrocompassing, using
low-cost gyroscopes, remains a significant challenge in scenarios where
external navigation aids are unavailable. Such challenges are commonly
addressed in real-world applications such as autonomous vehicles, where size,
weight, and power limitations restrict sensor quality, and noisy measurements
severely degrade gyrocompassing performance. To cope with this challenge, we
propose a novel diffusion denoiser-aided gyrocompass approach. It integrates a
diffusion-based denoising framework with an enhanced learning-based heading
estimation model. The diffusion denoiser processes raw inertial sensor signals
before input to the deep learning model, resulting in accurate gyrocompassing.
Experiments using both simulated and real sensor data demonstrate that our
proposed approach improves gyrocompassing accuracy by 26% compared to
model-based gyrocompassing and by 15% compared to other learning-driven
approaches. This advancement holds particular significance for ensuring
accurate and robust navigation in autonomous platforms that incorporate
low-cost gyroscopes within their navigation systems.

and optimizes control inputs at each step. However, its high computational
complexity makes implementation on resource-constrained microcontrollers

adaptively manage energy and time constraints, we introduce an extended Monte

Abstract: Advances in wearable robotics challenge the traditional definition of human
motor systems, as wearable robots redefine body structure, movement capability,
and perception of their own bodies. We measured gait performance and perceived
body images via Selected Coefficient of Perceived Motion, SCoMo, after each
training session. Based on human motor learning theory extended to wearer-robot
systems, we hypothesized that learning the perceived body image when walking
with a robotic leg co-evolves with the actual gait improvement and becomes more
certain and more accurate to the actual motion. Our result confirmed that motor
learning improved both physical and perceived gait pattern towards normal,
indicating that via practice the wearers incorporated the robotic leg into
their sensorimotor systems to enable wearer-robot movement coordination.
However, a persistent discrepancy between perceived and actual motion remained,
likely due to the absence of direct sensation and control of the prosthesis
from wearers. Additionally, the perceptual overestimation at the later training
sessions might limit further motor improvement. These findings suggest that
enhancing the human sense of wearable robots and frequent calibrating
perception of body image are essential for effective training with lower limb
wearable robots and for developing more embodied assistive technologies.

Conclusion: 该方法在噪声环境中实现了高精度的声源定位，为机器人交互提供了可靠的方向信息。

Abstract: This paper presents a sound source localization strategy that relies on a
microphone array embedded in an unmanned ground vehicle and an asynchronous
close-talking microphone near the operator. A signal coarse alignment strategy
is combined with a time-domain acoustic echo cancellation algorithm to estimate
a time-frequency ideal ratio mask to isolate the target speech from
interferences and environmental noise. This allows selective sound source
localization, and provides the robot with the direction of arrival of sound
from the active operator, which enables rich interaction in noisy scenarios.
Results demonstrate an average angle error of 4 degrees and an accuracy within
5 degrees of 95\% at a signal-to-noise ratio of 1dB, which is significantly
superior to the state-of-the-art localization methods.

Conclusion: 这些发现为具身认知研究提供了新视角，展示了PRC在理解未充分探索的认知特征中的潜力。

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that the dynamics of physical systems can be
utilized for the desired information processing under the framework of physical
reservoir computing (PRC). Robots with soft bodies are examples of such
physical systems, and their nonlinear body-environment dynamics can be used to
compute and generate the motor signals necessary for the control of their own
behavior. In this simulation study, we extend this approach to control and
embed not only one but also multiple behaviors into a type of soft robot called
a tensegrity robot. The resulting system, consisting of the robot and the
environment, is a multistable dynamical system that converges to different
attractors from varying initial conditions. Furthermore, attractor analysis
reveals that there exist "untrained attractors" in the state space of the
system outside the training data. These untrained attractors reflect the
intrinsic properties and structures of the tensegrity robot and its
interactions with the environment. The impacts of these recent findings in PRC
remain unexplored in embodied AI research. We here illustrate their potential
to understand various features of embodied cognition that have not been fully
addressed to date.

### [301] [Decision Transformer-Based Drone Trajectory Planning with Dynamic Safety-Efficiency Trade-Offs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21506)

Motivation: 传统多项式规划器需专家调参且调整效果有限，而强化学习规划器未明确解决安全与效率的权衡问题。

Method: 引入基于决策变换器的规划器，利用RTG参数动态调整安全与效率的权衡。

Result: 仿真和实际实验表明，该规划器通过调整RTG参数能动态优化安全与效率，且优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的规划器简单高效，适用于未知环境，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: A drone trajectory planner should be able to dynamically adjust the
safety-efficiency trade-off according to varying mission requirements in
unknown environments. Although traditional polynomial-based planners offer
computational efficiency and smooth trajectory generation, they require expert
knowledge to tune multiple parameters to adjust this trade-off. Moreover, even
with careful tuning, the resulting adjustment may fail to achieve the desired
trade-off. Similarly, although reinforcement learning-based planners are
adaptable in unknown environments, they do not explicitly address the
safety-efficiency trade-off. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a
Decision Transformer-based trajectory planner that leverages a single
parameter, Return-to-Go (RTG), as a \emph{temperature parameter} to dynamically
adjust the safety-efficiency trade-off. In our framework, since RTG intuitively
measures the safety and efficiency of a trajectory, RTG tuning does not require
expert knowledge. We validate our approach using Gazebo simulations in both
structured grid and unstructured random environments. The experimental results
demonstrate that our planner can dynamically adjust the safety-efficiency
trade-off by simply tuning the RTG parameter. Furthermore, our planner
outperforms existing baseline methods across various RTG settings, generating
safer trajectories when tuned for safety and more efficient trajectories when
tuned for efficiency. Real-world experiments further confirm the reliability
and practicality of our proposed planner.

Motivation: 多层室内探索是一个开放的研究领域，现有学习型探索器多限于2D环境，需扩展至3D。

Method: LITE将环境分解为楼层-楼梯拓扑，结合YOLO11实例分割模型和有限状态机实现楼层切换，并采用基于注意力的2D探索策略。

Result: 在HM3D和MP3D数据集上，LITE的2D探索策略显著优于基线方法，且在真实四足机器人上验证了泛化能力。

Conclusion: LITE框架兼容多种2D探索方法，为多层室内探索提供了高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: This work focuses on multi-floor indoor exploration, which remains an open
area of research. Compared to traditional methods, recent learning-based
explorers have demonstrated significant potential due to their robust
environmental learning and modeling capabilities, but most are restricted to 2D
environments. In this paper, we proposed a learning-integrated topological
explorer, LITE, for multi-floor indoor environments. LITE decomposes the
environment into a floor-stair topology, enabling seamless integration of
learning or non-learning-based 2D exploration methods for 3D exploration. As we
incrementally build floor-stair topology in exploration using YOLO11-based
instance segmentation model, the agent can transition between floors through a
finite state machine. Additionally, we implement an attention-based 2D
exploration policy that utilizes an attention mechanism to capture spatial
dependencies between different regions, thereby determining the next global
goal for more efficient exploration. Extensive comparison and ablation studies
conducted on the HM3D and MP3D datasets demonstrate that our proposed 2D
exploration policy significantly outperforms all baseline explorers in terms of
exploration efficiency. Furthermore, experiments in several 3D multi-floor
environments indicate that our framework is compatible with various 2D
exploration methods, facilitating effective multi-floor indoor exploration.
Finally, we validate our method in the real world with a quadruped robot,
highlighting its strong generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Human demonstration data is often ambiguous and incomplete, motivating
imitation learning approaches that also exhibit reliable planning behavior. A
common paradigm to perform planning-from-demonstration involves learning a
reward function via Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) then deploying this
reward via Model Predictive Control (MPC). Towards unifying these methods, we
derive a replacement of the policy in IRL with a planning-based agent. With
connections to Adversarial Imitation Learning, this formulation enables
end-to-end interactive learning of planners from observation-only
demonstrations. In addition to benefits in interpretability, complexity, and
safety, we study and observe significant improvements on sample efficiency,
out-of-distribution generalization, and robustness. The study includes
evaluations in both simulated control benchmarks and real-world navigation
experiments using few-to-single observation-only demonstrations.

Result: 在多样真实任务中，UniDomain零样本解决复杂任务，任务成功率提升58%，规划最优性提升160%。

Conclusion: UniDomain通过统一领域和元领域融合，显著提升了机器人任务规划的泛化能力和性能。

Abstract: Robotic task planning in real-world environments requires reasoning over
implicit constraints from language and vision. While LLMs and VLMs offer strong
priors, they struggle with long-horizon structure and symbolic grounding.
Existing methods that combine LLMs with symbolic planning often rely on
handcrafted or narrow domains, limiting generalization. We propose UniDomain, a
framework that pre-trains a PDDL domain from robot manipulation demonstrations
and applies it for online robotic task planning. It extracts atomic domains
from 12,393 manipulation videos to form a unified domain with 3137 operators,
2875 predicates, and 16481 causal edges. Given a target class of tasks, it
retrieves relevant atomics from the unified domain and systematically fuses
them into high-quality meta-domains to support compositional generalization in
planning. Experiments on diverse real-world tasks show that UniDomain solves
complex, unseen tasks in a zero-shot manner, achieving up to 58% higher task
success and 160% improvement in plan optimality over state-of-the-art LLM and
LLM-PDDL baselines.

limitations. The environment taken as reference in this work is the highly
challenging case of underground tunnels. We also highlight potential new
research areas still under-explored.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of autonomous driving technology,
vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication has emerged as a key enabler for
extending perception range and enhancing driving safety by providing visibility
beyond the line of sight. However, integrating multi-source sensor data from
both ego-vehicles and infrastructure under real-world constraints, such as
limited communication bandwidth and dynamic environments, presents significant
technical challenges. To facilitate research in this area, we organized the
End-to-End Autonomous Driving through V2X Cooperation Challenge, which features
two tracks: cooperative temporal perception and cooperative end-to-end
planning. Built on the UniV2X framework and the V2X-Seq-SPD dataset, the
challenge attracted participation from over 30 teams worldwide and established
a unified benchmark for evaluating cooperative driving systems. This paper
describes the design and outcomes of the challenge, highlights key research
problems including bandwidth-aware fusion, robust multi-agent planning, and
heterogeneous sensor integration, and analyzes emerging technical trends among
top-performing solutions. By addressing practical constraints in communication
and data fusion, the challenge contributes to the development of scalable and
reliable V2X-cooperative autonomous driving systems.

Motivation: 传统SLAM方法在动态环境中因假设静态环境而存在定位漂移问题，现有系统在视角突变和动态物体处理上仍有不足。

Result: 在TUM RGB-D数据集上的实验表明，该方法在动态场景下显著提升了定位精度和系统鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的框架和策略有效解决了动态环境中的SLAM定位问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) plays a vital role in
real-time localization for autonomous systems. However, traditional SLAM
methods, which assume a static environment, often suffer from significant
localization drift in dynamic scenarios. While recent advancements have
improved SLAM performance in such environments, these systems still struggle
with localization drift, particularly due to abrupt viewpoint changes and
poorly characterized moving objects. In this paper, we propose a novel
scene-object-based reliability assessment framework that comprehensively
evaluates SLAM stability through both current frame quality metrics and scene
changes relative to reliable reference frames. Furthermore, to tackle the lack
of error correction mechanisms in existing systems when pose estimation becomes
unreliable, we employ a pose refinement strategy that leverages information
from reliable frames to optimize camera pose estimation, effectively mitigating
the adverse effects of dynamic interference. Extensive experiments on the TUM
RGB-D datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves substantial improvements
in localization accuracy and system robustness under challenging dynamic
scenarios.

Motivation: 在障碍物密集环境中，多无人机通信受限，需通过多跳网络实现可靠通信，但设计网络结构和维持动态连接是挑战。

Method: 提出基于最小边RRT*算法的约束搜索方法设计网络拓扑，采用分布式模型预测控制策略协调运动，考虑距离和视线连接约束。

Result: 仿真和硬件实验验证了方法的有效性，确保无人机轨迹无碰撞且始终保持视线连接。

Conclusion: 该方法为多无人机在复杂环境中的可靠通信提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: A reliable communication network is essential for multiple UAVs operating
within obstacle-cluttered environments, where limited communication due to
obstructions often occurs. A common solution is to deploy intermediate UAVs to
relay information via a multi-hop network, which introduces two challenges: (i)
how to design the structure of multihop networks; and (ii) how to maintain
connectivity during collaborative motion. To this end, this work first proposes
an efficient constrained search method based on the minimumedge RRT? algorithm,
to find a spanning-tree topology that requires a less number of UAVs for the
deployment task. Then, to achieve this deployment, a distributed model
predictive control strategy is proposed for the online motion coordination. It
explicitly incorporates not only the inter-UAV and UAVobstacle distance
constraints, but also the line-of-sight (LOS) connectivity constraint. These
constraints are well-known to be nonlinear and often tackled by various
approximations. In contrast, this work provides a theoretical guarantee that
all agent trajectories are ensured to be collision-free with a teamwise LOS
connectivity at all time. Numerous simulations are performed in 3D valley-like
environments, while hardware experiments validate its dynamic adaptation when
the deployment position changes online.

Conclusion: MoDeSuite有望推动移动操作可变形物体的研究发展。

Abstract: Mobile manipulation is a critical capability for robots operating in diverse,
real-world environments. However, manipulating deformable objects and materials
remains a major challenge for existing robot learning algorithms. While various
benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate manipulation strategies with rigid
objects, there is still a notable lack of standardized benchmarks that address
mobile manipulation tasks involving deformable objects.
  To address this gap, we introduce MoDeSuite, the first Mobile Manipulation
Deformable Object task suite, designed specifically for robot learning.
MoDeSuite consists of eight distinct mobile manipulation tasks covering both
elastic objects and deformable objects, each presenting a unique challenge
inspired by real-world robot applications. Success in these tasks requires
effective collaboration between the robot's base and manipulator, as well as
the ability to exploit the deformability of the objects. To evaluate and
demonstrate the use of the proposed benchmark, we train two state-of-the-art
reinforcement learning algorithms and two imitation learning algorithms,
highlighting the difficulties encountered and showing their performance in
simulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate the practical relevance of the suite by
deploying the trained policies directly into the real world with the Spot
robot, showcasing the potential for sim-to-real transfer. We expect that
MoDeSuite will open a novel research domain in mobile manipulation involving
deformable objects. Find more details, code, and videos at

Abstract: Scientific testing techniques are essential for ensuring the safe operation
of autonomous vehicles (AVs), with high-risk, highly interactive scenarios
being a primary focus. To address the limitations of existing testing methods,
such as their heavy reliance on high-quality test data, weak interaction
capabilities, and low adversarial robustness, this paper proposes ExamPPO, an
interactive adversarial testing framework that enables scenario-adaptive and
intensity-controllable evaluation of autonomous vehicles. The framework models
the Surrounding Vehicle (SV) as an intelligent examiner, equipped with a
multi-head attention-enhanced policy network, enabling context-sensitive and
sustained behavioral interventions. A scalar confrontation factor is introduced
to modulate the intensity of adversarial behaviors, allowing continuous,
fine-grained adjustment of test difficulty. Coupled with structured evaluation
metrics, ExamPPO systematically probes AV's robustness across diverse scenarios
and strategies. Extensive experiments across multiple scenarios and AV
strategies demonstrate that ExamPPO can effectively modulate adversarial
behavior, expose decision-making weaknesses in tested AVs, and generalize
across heterogeneous environments, thereby offering a unified and reproducible
solution for evaluating the safety and intelligence of autonomous
decision-making systems.

Abstract: Testing and evaluating automated driving systems (ADS) in interactions with
vulnerable road users (VRUs), such as cyclists, are essential for improving the
safety of VRUs, but often lack realism. This paper presents and validates a
coupled in-the-loop test environment that integrates a Cyclist-in-the Loop test
bench with a Vehicle-in-the-Loop test bench via a virtual environment (VE)
developed in Unreal Engine 5. The setup enables closed-loop, bidirectional
interaction between a real human cyclist and a real automated vehicle under
safe and controllable conditions. The automated vehicle reacts to cyclist
gestures via stimulated camera input, while the cyclist, riding a stationary
bicycle, perceives and reacts to the vehicle in the VE in real time. Validation
experiments are conducted using a real automated shuttle bus with a
track-and-follow function, performing three test maneuvers - straight-line
driving with stop, circular track driving, and double lane change - on a
proving ground and in the coupled in-the-loop test environment. The performance
is evaluated by comparing the resulting vehicle trajectories in both
environments. Additionally, the introduced latencies of individual components
in the test setup are measured. The results demonstrate the feasibility of the
approach and highlight its strengths and limitations for realistic ADS
evaluation.

Abstract: One major recurring challenge in deploying manipulation robots is determining
the optimal placement of manipulators to maximize performance. This challenge
is exacerbated in complex, cluttered agricultural environments of high-value
crops, such as flowers, fruits, and vegetables, that could greatly benefit from
robotic systems tailored to their specific requirements. However, the design of
such systems remains a challenging, intuition-driven process, limiting the
affordability and adoption of robotics-based automation by domain experts like
farmers. To address this challenge, we propose a four-part design optimization
methodology for automating the development of task-specific robotic systems.
This framework includes (a) a robot design model, (b) task and environment
representations for simulation, (c) task-specific performance metrics, and (d)
optimization algorithms for refining configurations. We demonstrate our
framework by optimizing a dual-arm robotic system for pepper harvesting using
two off-the-shelf redundant manipulators. To enhance performance, we introduce
novel task metrics that leverage self-motion manifolds to characterize
manipulator redundancy comprehensively. Our results show that our framework
achieves simultaneous improvements in reachability success rates and
improvements in dexterity. Specifically, our approach improves reachability
success by at least 14\% over baseline methods and achieves over 30\%
improvement in dexterity based on our task-specific metric.

Abstract: Redundant manipulators are well understood to offer infinite joint
configurations for achieving a desired end-effector pose. The multiplicity of
inverse kinematics (IK) solutions allows for the simultaneous solving of
auxiliary tasks like avoiding joint limits or obstacles. However, the most
widely used IK solvers are numerical gradient-based iterative methods that
inherently return a locally optimal solution. In this work, we explore the
computation of self-motion manifolds (SMMs), which represent the set of all
joint configurations that solve the inverse kinematics problem for redundant
manipulators. Thus, SMMs are global IK solutions for redundant manipulators. We
focus on task redundancies of dimensionality 1, introducing a novel ODE
formulation for computing SMMs using standard explicit fixed-step ODE
integrators. We also address the challenge of ``inducing'' redundancy in
otherwise non-redundant manipulators assigned to tasks naturally described by
one degree of freedom less than the non-redundant manipulator. Furthermore,
recognizing that SMMs can consist of multiple disconnected components, we
propose methods for searching for these separate SMM components. Our
formulations and algorithms compute accurate SMM solutions without requiring
additional IK refinement, and we extend our methods to prismatic joint systems
-- an area not covered in current SMM literature. This manuscript presents the
derivation of these methods and several examples that show how the methods work
and their limitations.

Abstract: Retinal vein cannulation (RVC) is a minimally invasive microsurgical
procedure for treating retinal vein occlusion (RVO), a leading cause of vision
impairment. However, the small size and fragility of retinal veins, coupled
with the need for high-precision, tremor-free needle manipulation, create
significant technical challenges. These limitations highlight the need for
robotic assistance to improve accuracy and stability. This study presents an
automated robotic system with a top-down microscope and B-scan optical
coherence tomography (OCT) imaging for precise depth sensing. Deep
learning-based models enable real-time needle navigation, contact detection,
and vein puncture recognition, using a chicken embryo model as a surrogate for
human retinal veins. The system autonomously detects needle position and
puncture events with 85% accuracy. The experiments demonstrate notable
reductions in navigation and puncture times compared to manual methods. Our
results demonstrate the potential of integrating advanced imaging and deep
learning to automate microsurgical tasks, providing a pathway for safer and
more reliable RVC procedures with enhanced precision and reproducibility.

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对四足机器人操作任务的高效非线性模型预测控制（NMPC）框架，结合分解策略实现实时控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 四足机器人在操作任务中面临高自由度模型的复杂性和计算效率问题，需要高效的控制算法。

Method: 采用分解策略，将运动模板模型（如单刚体模型）与机械臂全阶动态模型结合，实现扭矩级控制。

Result: NMPC框架在60Hz下实时求解，并通过仿真和硬件实验验证了其鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该框架在复杂操作任务中表现出稳定性和适应性，适用于外部干扰、负载变化和不平坦地形。

Abstract: Model predictive control (MPC) combined with reduced-order template models
has emerged as a powerful tool for trajectory optimization in dynamic legged
locomotion. However, loco-manipulation tasks performed by legged robots
introduce additional complexity, necessitating computationally efficient MPC
algorithms capable of handling high-degree-of-freedom (DoF) models. This letter
presents a computationally efficient nonlinear MPC (NMPC) framework tailored
for loco-manipulation tasks of quadrupedal robots equipped with robotic
manipulators whose dynamics are non-negligible relative to those of the
quadruped. The proposed framework adopts a decomposition strategy that couples
locomotion template models -- such as the single rigid body (SRB) model -- with
a full-order dynamic model of the robotic manipulator for torque-level control.
This decomposition enables efficient real-time solution of the NMPC problem in
a receding horizon fashion at 60 Hz. The optimal state and input trajectories
generated by the NMPC for locomotion are tracked by a low-level nonlinear
whole-body controller (WBC) running at 500 Hz, while the optimal torque
commands for the manipulator are directly applied. The layered control
architecture is validated through extensive numerical simulations and hardware
experiments on a 15-kg Unitree Go2 quadrupedal robot augmented with a 4.4-kg
4-DoF Kinova arm. Given that the Kinova arm dynamics are non-negligible
relative to the Go2 base, the proposed NMPC framework demonstrates robust
stability in performing diverse loco-manipulation tasks, effectively handling
external disturbances, payload variations, and uneven terrain.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“combolutional layer”的新方法，用于音频任务中的谐波特征提取，具有低参数、高效计算和可解释性等优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在音频任务中，选择合适的归纳偏置对机器学习模型设计至关重要，尤其是短音频片段可能包含数百万样本的情况下。

Method: 提出了一种结合学习延迟IIR梳状滤波器和融合包络检测器的combolutional层，用于时域谐波特征提取。

Result: 在三个信息检索任务中验证了combolutional层的有效性，其计算成本低，适用于钢琴转录、说话人分类和音调检测等任务。

Conclusion: combolutional层是卷积层的有效替代，具有低参数、高效CPU推理、纯实数计算和更好的可解释性等优势。

Abstract: Selecting appropriate inductive biases is an essential step in the design of
machine learning models, especially when working with audio, where even short
clips may contain millions of samples. To this end, we propose the
combolutional layer: a learned-delay IIR comb filter and fused envelope
detector, which extracts harmonic features in the time domain. We demonstrate
the efficacy of the combolutional layer on three information retrieval tasks,
evaluate its computational cost relative to other audio frontends, and provide
efficient implementations for training. We find that the combolutional layer is
an effective replacement for convolutional layers in audio tasks where precise
harmonic analysis is important, e.g., piano transcription, speaker
classification, and key detection. Additionally, the combolutional layer has
several other key benefits over existing frontends, namely: low parameter
count, efficient CPU inference, strictly real-valued computations, and improved
interpretability.

Motivation: 临床语音学和治疗监测中，有意义的语音评估至关重要。研究旨在验证主观评估与客观测量的一致性。

Method: 使用大型头颈癌数据集，训练听众对语音的可懂度、发音、音质等进行评分，并与客观声学测量对比。

Result: 主观可懂度、发音和音质高度相关，客观测量与主观评估一致。

Conclusion: 单一可懂度测量可能足以用于头颈癌患者的临床监测。

Abstract: Meaningful speech assessment is vital in clinical phonetics and therapy
monitoring. This study examined the link between perceptual speech assessments
and objective acoustic measures in a large head and neck cancer (HNC) dataset.
Trained listeners provided ratings of intelligibility, articulation, voice
quality, phonation, speech rate, nasality, and background noise on speech.
Strong correlations were found between subjective intelligibility,
articulation, and voice quality, likely due to a shared underlying cause of
speech symptoms in our speaker population. Objective measures of
intelligibility and speech rate aligned with their subjective counterpart. Our
results suggest that a single intelligibility measure may be sufficient for the
clinical monitoring of speakers treated for HNC using concomitant
chemoradiation.

Abstract: As speech generation technology advances, the risk of misuse through deepfake
audio has become a pressing concern, which underscores the critical need for
robust detection systems. However, many existing speech deepfake datasets are
limited in scale and diversity, making it challenging to train models that can
generalize well to unseen deepfakes. To address these gaps, we introduce
SpeechFake, a large-scale dataset designed specifically for speech deepfake
detection. SpeechFake includes over 3 million deepfake samples, totaling more
than 3,000 hours of audio, generated using 40 different speech synthesis tools.
The dataset encompasses a wide range of generation techniques, including
text-to-speech, voice conversion, and neural vocoder, incorporating the latest
cutting-edge methods. It also provides multilingual support, spanning 46
languages. In this paper, we offer a detailed overview of the dataset's
creation, composition, and statistics. We also present baseline results by
training detection models on SpeechFake, demonstrating strong performance on
both its own test sets and various unseen test sets. Additionally, we conduct
experiments to rigorously explore how generation methods, language diversity,
and speaker variation affect detection performance. We believe SpeechFake will
be a valuable resource for advancing speech deepfake detection and developing
more robust models for evolving generation techniques.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模无标签语音数据集中存在不良特征（如多说话者、非目标语言和音乐），可能影响模型学习效果。

Method: Whilter结合Whisper编码器和注意力分类器，同时解决五个分类问题，并发布了一个标注数据集。

Result: Whilter在五个子任务中的三个上F1分数超过85%，错误率为6.5%至7.8%，优于BEATs分类器，且处理时间更短。

Conclusion: Whilter是一种高效的多任务解决方案，能有效识别语音数据集中的不良样本，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Large-scale in-the-wild speech datasets have become more prevalent in recent
years due to increased interest in models that can learn useful features from
unlabelled data for tasks such as speech recognition or synthesis. These
datasets often contain undesirable features, such as multiple speakers,
non-target languages, and music, which may impact model learning. The Whilter
model is proposed as a multitask solution to identify these undesirable
samples. Whilter uses a Whisper encoder with an attention-based classifier to
solve five diverse classification problems at once. In addition, an annotated
dataset is published for a subset of two popular in-the-wild corpora. Whilter
achieves F1 scores above 85% and equal error rates of 6.5% to 7.8% for three of
five subtasks, outperforming a state-of-the-art BEATs classifier on
speech-specific classes, with a notable decrease in processing time compared to
a combination of single-task alternatives.

Abstract: The rise of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) in Artificial Intelligence (AI),
especially integrated with Large Language Models (LLMs), has greatly
facilitated the resolution of complex tasks. However, current systems are still
facing challenges of inter-agent communication, coordination, and interaction
with heterogeneous tools and resources. Most recently, the Model Context
Protocol (MCP) by Anthropic and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication protocol by
Google have been introduced, and to the best of our knowledge, very few
applications exist where both protocols are employed within a single MAS
framework. We present a pilot study of AgentMaster, a novel modular
multi-protocol MAS framework with self-implemented A2A and MCP, enabling
dynamic coordination and flexible communication. Through a unified
conversational interface, the system supports natural language interaction
without prior technical expertise and responds to multimodal queries for tasks
including information retrieval, question answering, and image analysis.
Evaluation through the BERTScore F1 and LLM-as-a-Judge metric G-Eval averaged
96.3\% and 87.1\%, revealing robust inter-agent coordination, query
decomposition, dynamic routing, and domain-specific, relevant responses.
Overall, our proposed framework contributes to the potential capabilities of
domain-specific, cooperative, and scalable conversational AI powered by MAS.

Motivation: 现有联邦推荐系统主要关注准确性，忽视了公平性和多样性。FedFlex旨在解决这一问题，特别是在Netflix风格的电视节目推荐中。

Method: FedFlex整合了两种先进的矩阵分解算法（SVD和BPR），并应用MMR重新排序以增强多样性。通过用户实验比较不同算法的推荐效果。

Result: 实验显示，FedFlex成功引入了多样性内容（如新类型），且未显著降低用户满意度。

Conclusion: FedFlex在联邦推荐系统中有效平衡了多样性和用户满意度，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Federated learning is a decentralized approach that enables collaborative
model training across multiple devices while preserving data privacy. It has
shown significant potential in various domains, including healthcare and
personalized recommendation systems. However, most existing work on federated
recommendation systems has focused primarily on improving accuracy, with
limited attention to fairness and diversity. In this paper, we introduce
FedFlex, a federated recommender system for Netflix-style TV series
recommendations. FedFlex integrates two state-of-the-art matrix factorization
algorithms for personalized fine-tuning. FedFlex also applies Maximal Marginal
Relevance (MMR) to re-rank items and enhance diversity. We conduct extensive
experiments comparing recommendations generated by SVD and BPR algorithms. In a
live two-week user study, participants received two recommendation lists: List
A, based on SVD or BPR, and List B, a re-ranked version emphasizing diversity.
Participants were asked to click on the movies they were interested in
watching. Our findings demonstrate that FedFlex effectively introduces diverse
content, such as new genres, into recommendations without necessarily
compromising user satisfaction.

Abstract: In an era of radical technology transformations, technology maps play a
crucial role in enhancing decision making. These maps heavily rely on automated
methods of technology extraction. This paper introduces Retrieval Augmented
Technology Extraction (RATE), a Large Language Model (LLM) based pipeline for
automated technology extraction from scientific literature. RATE combines
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with multi-definition LLM-based
validation. This hybrid method results in high recall in candidate generation
alongside with high precision in candidate filtering. While the pipeline is
designed to be general and widely applicable, we demonstrate its use on 678
research articles focused on Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) and Extended
Reality (XR) as a case study. Consequently, The validated technology terms by
RATE were mapped into a co-occurrence network, revealing thematic clusters and
structural features of the research landscape. For the purpose of evaluation, a
gold standard dataset of technologies in 70 selected random articles had been
curated by the experts. In addition, a technology extraction model based on
Bidirectional Encoder Representations of Transformers (BERT) was used as a
comparative method. RATE achieved F1-score of 91.27%, Significantly
outperforming BERT with F1-score of 53.73%. Our findings highlight the promise
of definition-driven LLM methods for technology extraction and mapping. They

Conclusion: LLMs是构建更自适应、语义丰富且以用户为中心的推荐系统的基础，而非辅助组件。

Abstract: Recommender systems have traditionally followed modular architectures
comprising candidate generation, multi-stage ranking, and re-ranking, each
trained separately with supervised objectives and hand-engineered features.
While effective in many domains, such systems face persistent challenges
including sparse and noisy interaction data, cold-start problems, limited
personalization depth, and inadequate semantic understanding of user and item
content. The recent emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers a new
paradigm for addressing these limitations through unified, language-native
mechanisms that can generalize across tasks, domains, and modalities. In this
paper, we present a comprehensive technical survey of how LLMs can be leveraged
to tackle key challenges in modern recommender systems. We examine the use of
LLMs for prompt-driven candidate retrieval, language-native ranking,
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and conversational recommendation,
illustrating how these approaches enhance personalization, semantic alignment,
and interpretability without requiring extensive task-specific supervision.
LLMs further enable zero- and few-shot reasoning, allowing systems to operate
effectively in cold-start and long-tail scenarios by leveraging external
knowledge and contextual cues. We categorize these emerging LLM-driven
architectures and analyze their effectiveness in mitigating core bottlenecks of
conventional pipelines. In doing so, we provide a structured framework for
understanding the design space of LLM-enhanced recommenders, and outline the
trade-offs between accuracy, scalability, and real-time performance. Our goal
is to demonstrate that LLMs are not merely auxiliary components but
foundational enablers for building more adaptive, semantically rich, and
user-centric recommender systems

Conclusion: 跨领域推荐方法在艺术治疗中具有潜力，音乐驱动的偏好引导能显著提升个性化推荐效果。

Abstract: Art Therapy (AT) is an established practice that facilitates emotional
processing and recovery through creative expression. Recently, Visual Art
Recommender Systems (VA RecSys) have emerged to support AT, demonstrating their
potential by personalizing therapeutic artwork recommendations. Nonetheless,
current VA RecSys rely on visual stimuli for user modeling, limiting their
ability to capture the full spectrum of emotional responses during preference
elicitation. Previous studies have shown that music stimuli elicit unique
affective reflections, presenting an opportunity for cross-domain
recommendation (CDR) to enhance personalization in AT. Since CDR has not yet
been explored in this context, we propose a family of CDR methods for AT based
on music-driven preference elicitation. A large-scale study with 200 users
demonstrates the efficacy of music-driven preference elicitation, outperforming
the classic visual-only elicitation approach. Our source code, data, and models

Conclusion: 提出的数据增强框架有效缓解了数据稀疏性和流行度偏差，提升了推荐系统性能。

Abstract: Recommendation systems often suffer from data sparsity caused by limited
user-item interactions, which degrade their performance and amplify popularity
bias in real-world scenarios. This paper proposes a novel data augmentation
framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and item textual
descriptions to enrich interaction data. By few-shot prompting LLMs multiple
times to rerank items and aggregating the results via majority voting, we
generate high-confidence synthetic user-item interactions, supported by
theoretical guarantees based on the concentration of measure. To effectively
leverage the augmented data in the context of a graph recommendation system, we
integrate it into a graph contrastive learning framework to mitigate
distributional shift and alleviate popularity bias. Extensive experiments show
that our method improves accuracy and reduces popularity bias, outperforming
strong baselines.

Abstract: The importance of recommender systems on the web has grown, especially in the
movie industry, with a vast selection of options to watch. To assist users in
traversing available items and finding relevant results, recommender systems
analyze operational data and investigate users' tastes and habits. Providing
highly individualized suggestions can boost user engagement and satisfaction,
which is one of the fundamental goals of the movie industry, significantly in
online platforms. According to recent studies and research, using
knowledge-based techniques and considering the semantic ideas of the textual
data is a suitable way to get more appropriate results. This study provides a
new method for building a knowledge graph based on semantic information. It
uses the ChatGPT, as a large language model, to assess the brief descriptions
of movies and extract their tone of voice. Results indicated that using the
proposed method may significantly enhance accuracy rather than employing the

Result: 发现嵌入空间是分层空间，局部维度随点变化；RL代理的行为表现为低维度固定策略与高维度突发交替。

Conclusion: 分层潜在空间的维度分布可作为RL游戏复杂性的新几何指标。

Abstract: In this work, we explore the structure of the embedding space of a
transformer model trained for playing a particular reinforcement learning (RL)
game. Specifically, we investigate how a transformer-based Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) model embeds visual inputs in a simple environment where an
agent must collect "coins" while avoiding dynamic obstacles consisting of
"spotlights." By adapting Robinson et al.'s study of the volume growth
transform for LLMs to the RL setting, we find that the token embedding space
for our visual coin collecting game is also not a manifold, and is better
modeled as a stratified space, where local dimension can vary from point to
point. We further strengthen Robinson's method by proving that fairly general
volume growth curves can be realized by stratified spaces. Finally, we carry
out an analysis that suggests that as an RL agent acts, its latent
representation alternates between periods of low local dimension, while
following a fixed sub-strategy, and bursts of high local dimension, where the
agent achieves a sub-goal (e.g., collecting an object) or where the
environmental complexity increases (e.g., more obstacles appear). Consequently,
our work suggests that the distribution of dimensions in a stratified latent
space may provide a new geometric indicator of complexity for RL games.

Main category: nlin.AO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种广义Kuramoto模型，结合了二次谐波（成对）和四次谐波（四次）耦合，用于实现密集联想记忆。通过理论分析和模拟验证，展示了其高容量和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将Kuramoto同步与现代Hopfield记忆理论结合，探索在振荡器系统中实现高容量模拟联想记忆的可能性。

Method: 引入广义Kuramoto模型，结合二次和四次谐波耦合，利用平均场理论及其动力学近似分析相图。

Conclusion: 该模型为实验实现高容量模拟联想记忆提供了理论支持，扩展了Kuramoto模型的应用范围。

Abstract: Networks of phase oscillators can serve as dense associative memories if they
incorporate higher-order coupling beyond the classical Kuramoto model's
pairwise interactions. Here we introduce a generalized Kuramoto model with
combined second-harmonic (pairwise) and fourth-harmonic (quartic) coupling,
inspired by dense Hopfield memory theory. Using mean-field theory and its
dynamical approximation, we obtain a phase diagram for dense associative memory
model that exhibits a tricritical point at which the continuous onset of memory
retrieval is supplanted by a discontinuous, hysteretic transition. In the
quartic-dominated regime, the system supports bistable phase-locked states
corresponding to stored memory patterns, with a sizable energy barrier between
memory and incoherent states. We analytically determine this bistable region
and show that the escape time from a memory state (due to noise) grows
exponentially with network size, indicating robust storage. Extending the
theory to finite memory load, we show that higher-order couplings achieve
superlinear scaling of memory capacity with system size, far exceeding the
limit of pairwise-only oscillators. Large-scale simulations of the oscillator
network confirm our theoretical predictions, demonstrating rapid pattern
retrieval and robust storage of many phase patterns. These results bridge the
Kuramoto synchronization with modern Hopfield memories, pointing toward
experimental realization of high-capacity, analog associative memory in
oscillator systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多智能体验证框架（MAVF），用于解决芯片验证中的瓶颈问题，通过多智能体协作显著提升了验证效率和自动化水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前单一大语言模型在复杂芯片验证任务中存在局限性，亟需创新方法提升验证自动化水平。

Method: MAVF通过多智能体协作，实现从设计规范到测试平台的自动化转换，包括规范解析、验证策略生成和代码实现。

Result: 实验表明，MAVF在验证文档解析、生成及自动化测试平台生成方面显著优于传统方法和单一大语言模型。

Conclusion: MAVF为生成式AI在验证自动化中的应用开辟了新方向，有望解决芯片设计中最具挑战性的瓶颈问题。

Abstract: As large language models demonstrate enormous potential in the field of
Electronic Design Automation (EDA), generative AI-assisted chip design is
attracting widespread attention from academia and industry. Although these
technologies have made preliminary progress in tasks such as code generation,
their application in chip verification -- a critical bottleneck in the chip
development cycle -- remains at an exploratory stage. This paper proposes an
innovative Multi-Agent Verification Framework (MAVF) aimed at addressing the
limitations of current single-LLM approaches in complex verification tasks. Our
framework builds an automated transformation system from design specifications
to testbench through the collaborative work of multiple specialized agents,
including specification parsing, verification strategy generation, and code
implementation. Through verification experiments on multiple chip modules of
varying complexity, results show that MAVF significantly outperforms
traditional manual methods and single-dialogue generative AI approaches in
verification document parsing and generation, as well as automated testbench
generation. This research opens new directions for exploring generative AI
applications in verification automation, potentially providing effective
approaches to solving the most challenging bottleneck issues in chip design.

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在多项Logit模型（MNL）规范和估计中的潜力，通过实验评估了六种主流LLM的表现，发现专有模型表现优于开源模型，并提供了实际应用建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在尚未充分研究的领域——选择建模中的潜力，特别是作为辅助工具支持MNL模型的规范和估计。

Method: 设计了包含13个LLM版本的实验框架，评估了五种配置（建模目标、提示策略、信息可用性），并通过拟合度、行为合理性和模型复杂度评估结果。

Result: 专有LLM（如Claude 4 Sonnet和GPT）能生成有效且行为合理的模型规范，而开源模型表现较差。GPT-3还能通过自生成代码完成估计。

Conclusion: LLMs在选择建模中具有潜力，尤其在规范和支持决策方面，但需注意其局限性，并提供了实际应用建议。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used to support various workflows
across different disciplines, yet their potential in choice modelling remains
relatively unexplored. This work examines the potential of LLMs as assistive
agents in the specification and, where technically feasible, estimation of
Multinomial Logit models. We implement a systematic experimental framework
involving thirteen versions of six leading LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek,
Gemini, Gemma, and Llama) evaluated under five experimental configurations.
These configurations vary along three dimensions: modelling goal (suggesting
vs. suggesting and estimating MNLs); prompting strategy (Zero-Shot vs.
Chain-of-Thoughts); and information availability (full dataset vs. data
dictionary only). Each LLM-suggested specification is implemented, estimated,
and evaluated based on goodness-of-fit metrics, behavioural plausibility, and
model complexity. Findings reveal that proprietary LLMs can generate valid and
behaviourally sound utility specifications, particularly when guided by
structured prompts. Open-weight models such as Llama and Gemma struggled to
produce meaningful specifications. Claude 4 Sonnet consistently produced the
best-fitting and most complex models, while GPT models suggested models with
robust and stable modelling outcomes. Some LLMs performed better when provided
with just data dictionary, suggesting that limiting raw data access may enhance
internal reasoning capabilities. Among all LLMs, GPT o3 was uniquely capable of
correctly estimating its own specifications by executing self-generated code.
Overall, the results demonstrate both the promise and current limitations of
LLMs as assistive agents in choice modelling, not only for model specification
but also for supporting modelling decision and estimation, and provide
practical guidance for integrating these tools into choice modellers'
workflows.

with nonlinear control. Under the assumption of ideal observability, the CAO
state equations are provided for both stationary and non-stationary cases. The
fundamental role of the configuration matrix, which combines information about
the types of cardinal semantic operators in the CAO, their parameters and
topology of connectivity, is demonstrated.

Abstract: We present diffSPH, a novel open-source differentiable Smoothed Particle
Hydrodynamics (SPH) framework developed entirely in PyTorch with GPU
acceleration. diffSPH is designed centrally around differentiation to
facilitate optimization and machine learning (ML) applications in Computational
Fluid Dynamics~(CFD), including training neural networks and the development of
hybrid models. Its differentiable SPH core, and schemes for compressible (with
shock capturing and multi-phase flows), weakly compressible (with boundary
handling and free-surface flows), and incompressible physics, enable a broad
range of application areas. We demonstrate the framework's unique capabilities
through several applications, including addressing particle shifting via a
novel, target-oriented approach by minimizing physical and regularization loss
terms, a task often intractable in traditional solvers. Further examples
include optimizing initial conditions and physical parameters to match target
trajectories, shape optimization, implementing a solver-in-the-loop setup to
emulate higher-order integration, and demonstrating gradient propagation
through hundreds of full simulation steps. Prioritizing readability, usability,
and extensibility, this work offers a foundational platform for the CFD
community to develop and deploy novel neural networks and adjoint optimization
applications.

Motivation: 传统离散选择模型关注替代方案间的关系，但现有深度学习方法未能显式捕捉这一点。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用图神经网络（GNN）框架，通过消息传递显式捕捉空间替代方案间的依赖关系，并与经典随机效用理论保持联系。

Result: GNN-DCMs在预测芝加哥77个社区居住地选择时，表现优于多项Logit模型（MNL）、空间相关Logit模型（SCL）和前馈神经网络。

Conclusion: GNN-DCMs为复杂空间选择场景提供了一种统一且表达力强的框架，融合了离散选择建模与深度学习的优势。

Abstract: Researchers have adopted deep learning for classical discrete choice analysis
as it can capture complex feature relationships and achieve higher predictive
performance. However, the existing deep learning approaches cannot explicitly
capture the relationship among choice alternatives, which has been a
long-lasting focus in classical discrete choice models. To address the gap,
this paper introduces Graph Neural Network (GNN) as a novel framework to
analyze residential location choice. The GNN-based discrete choice models
(GNN-DCMs) offer a structured approach for neural networks to capture
dependence among spatial alternatives, while maintaining clear connections to
classical random utility theory. Theoretically, we demonstrate that the
GNN-DCMs incorporate the nested logit (NL) model and the spatially correlated
logit (SCL) model as two specific cases, yielding novel algorithmic
interpretation through message passing among alternatives' utilities.
Empirically, the GNN-DCMs outperform benchmark MNL, SCL, and feedforward neural
networks in predicting residential location choices among Chicago's 77
community areas. Regarding model interpretation, the GNN-DCMs can capture
individual heterogeneity and exhibit spatially-aware substitution patterns.
Overall, these results highlight the potential of GNN-DCMs as a unified and
expressive framework for synergizing discrete choice modeling and deep learning
in the complex spatial choice contexts.

Result: 理论验证了梯度下降在LPLR内具有线性收敛速率，与实际观察一致。

Conclusion: 通过NTK框架连接局部几何与快速优化，为深度学习中梯度下降的高效性提供了理论解释。

Abstract: The convergence of gradient descent (GD) on the non-convex loss landscapes of
deep neural networks (DNNs) presents a fundamental theoretical challenge. While
recent work has established that GD converges to a stationary point at a
sublinear rate within locally quasi-convex regions (LQCRs), this fails to
explain the exponential convergence rates consistently observed in practice. In
this paper, we resolve this discrepancy by proving that under a mild assumption
on Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) stability, these same regions satisfy a local
Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) condition. We introduce the concept of a Locally
Polyak-Lojasiewicz Region (LPLR), where the squared gradient norm lower-bounds
the suboptimality gap, prove that properly initialized finite-width networks
admit such regions around initialization, and establish that GD achieves linear
convergence within an LPLR, providing the first finite-width guarantee that
matches empirically observed rates. We validate our theory across diverse
settings, from controlled experiments on fully-connected networks to modern
ResNet architectures trained with stochastic methods, demonstrating that LPLR
structure emerges robustly in practical deep learning scenarios. By rigorously
connecting local landscape geometry to fast optimization through the NTK
framework, our work provides a definitive theoretical explanation for the
remarkable efficiency of gradient-based optimization in deep learning.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Copula Discrepancy (CD)的诊断工具，用于评估近似MCMC采样器的依赖结构准确性，解决了传统方法在偏置采样器中的失效问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代贝叶斯机器学习中的可扩展MCMC算法（如SGLD）牺牲了渐近精确性以换取计算速度，导致传统样本质量诊断方法失效。Stein-based诊断虽能检测分布不匹配，但无法直接评估依赖结构。

Method: 利用Sklar定理，提出Copula Discrepancy (CD)，独立于边际分布量化样本依赖结构的保真度。包括理论框架和计算高效实现。

Result: 实验表明，CD在偏置MCMC的超参数选择中显著优于传统方法（如有效样本量），并能检测尾部依赖的细微差异。计算开销远低于现有Stein差异。

Conclusion: CD为MCMC实践者提供了实用工具，并为下一代结构感知样本质量评估奠定了理论基础。

Abstract: The scalable Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms that underpin modern
Bayesian machine learning, such as Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics
(SGLD), sacrifice asymptotic exactness for computational speed, creating a
critical diagnostic gap: traditional sample quality measures fail
catastrophically when applied to biased samplers. While powerful Stein-based
diagnostics can detect distributional mismatches, they provide no direct
assessment of dependence structure, often the primary inferential target in
multivariate problems. We introduce the Copula Discrepancy (CD), a principled
and computationally efficient diagnostic that leverages Sklar's theorem to
isolate and quantify the fidelity of a sample's dependence structure
independent of its marginals. Our theoretical framework provides the first
structure-aware diagnostic specifically designed for the era of approximate
inference. Empirically, we demonstrate that a moment-based CD dramatically
outperforms standard diagnostics like effective sample size for hyperparameter
selection in biased MCMC, correctly identifying optimal configurations where
traditional methods fail. Furthermore, our robust MLE-based variant can detect
subtle but critical mismatches in tail dependence that remain invisible to rank
correlation-based approaches, distinguishing between samples with identical
Kendall's tau but fundamentally different extreme-event behavior. With
computational overhead orders of magnitude lower than existing Stein
discrepancies, the CD provides both immediate practical value for MCMC
practitioners and a theoretical foundation for the next generation of
structure-aware sample quality assessment.

Motivation: 理解SGMCMC算法如何与神经网络损失函数的退化性相互作用，填补现有理论假设与实际情况之间的差距。

Method: 引入了一种评估SGMCMC算法局部采样性能的新基准，并测试了多种常见算法。

Result: RMSProp预处理的SGLD算法在反映后验分布局部几何特性方面表现最佳，实验表明在参数规模达O(100M)的模型中仍能提取有用的局部信息。

Conclusion: 尽管缺乏全局收敛的理论保证，但局部采样方法在退化性损失函数中仍能提供有价值的信息。

Abstract: Degeneracy is an inherent feature of the loss landscape of neural networks,
but it is not well understood how stochastic gradient MCMC (SGMCMC) algorithms
interact with this degeneracy. In particular, current global convergence
guarantees for common SGMCMC algorithms rely on assumptions which are likely
incompatible with degenerate loss landscapes. In this paper, we argue that this
gap requires a shift in focus from global to local posterior sampling, and, as
a first step, we introduce a novel scalable benchmark for evaluating the local
sampling performance of SGMCMC algorithms. We evaluate a number of common
algorithms, and find that RMSProp-preconditioned SGLD is most effective at
faithfully representing the local geometry of the posterior distribution.
Although we lack theoretical guarantees about global sampler convergence, our
empirical results show that we are able to extract non-trivial local
information in models with up to O(100M) parameters.

a stochastic differential equation model to capture the intricate dynamics of

parameters on deforestation incentives. To address the challenge of parameter

understand forest transition dynamics and deforestation trends at any future

Result: 发现每段划分的概率质量期望为1/(N+1)，离散熵为log2(N+1)比特。

Conclusion: 该非参数框架为密度和尾部估计等稳健推断提供了新视角，与传统ECDF方法形成对比。

Abstract: This paper investigates what can be inferred about an arbitrary continuous
probability distribution from a finite sample of $N$ observations drawn from
it. The central finding is that the $N$ sorted sample points partition the real
line into $N+1$ segments, each carrying an expected probability mass of exactly
$1/(N+1)$. This non-parametric result, which follows from fundamental
properties of order statistics, holds regardless of the underlying
distribution's shape. This equal-probability partition yields a discrete
entropy of $\log_2(N+1)$ bits, which quantifies the information gained from the
sample and contrasts with Shannon's results for continuous variables. I compare
this partition-based framework to the conventional ECDF and discuss its
implications for robust non-parametric inference, particularly in density and
tail estimation.

Method: 通过定义单一损失函数，扩展梯度提升框架，提出MIBoost算法，实现跨填补数据集的统一变量选择。

Result: 模拟研究表明，MIBoost的预测性能与近期提出的方法相当。

Conclusion: MIBoost为缺失数据下的变量选择提供了一种有效且易于实现的解决方案。

Abstract: Statistical learning methods for automated variable selection, such as LASSO,
elastic nets, or gradient boosting, have become increasingly popular tools for
building powerful prediction models. Yet, in practice, analyses are often
complicated by missing data. The most widely used approach to address
missingness is multiple imputation, which creates several completed datasets.
However, there is an ongoing debate on how to perform model selection in the
presence of multiple imputed datasets. Simple strategies, such as pooling
models across datasets, have been shown to have suboptimal properties. Although
more sophisticated methods exist, they are often difficult to implement and
therefore not widely applied. In contrast, two recent approaches modify the
regularization methods LASSO and elastic nets by defining a single loss
function, resulting in a unified set of coefficients across imputations. Our
key contribution is to extend this principle to the framework of component-wise
gradient boosting by proposing MIBoost, a novel algorithm that employs a
uniform variable-selection mechanism across imputed datasets. Simulation
studies suggest that our approach yields prediction performance comparable to
that of these recently proposed methods.

Result: 该方法输入脏图像和点扩散函数（PSF），能高效生成高质量重建图像，适应不同可见性覆盖范围，动态范围更广，并提供不确定性量化。

Conclusion: RI-GAN为下一代射电望远镜提供了计算高效、可扩展且具有不确定性感知的成像方法。

Abstract: With the rise of large radio interferometric telescopes, particularly the
SKA, there is a growing demand for computationally efficient image
reconstruction techniques. Existing reconstruction methods, such as the CLEAN
algorithm or proximal optimisation approaches, are iterative in nature,
necessitating a large amount of compute. These methods either provide no
uncertainty quantification or require large computational overhead to do so.
Learned reconstruction methods have shown promise in providing efficient and
high quality reconstruction. In this article we explore the use of generative
neural networks that enable efficient approximate sampling of the posterior
distribution for high quality reconstructions with uncertainty quantification.
Our RI-GAN framework, builds on the regularised conditional generative
adversarial network (rcGAN) framework by integrating a gradient U-Net (GU-Net)
architecture - a hybrid reconstruction model that embeds the measurement
operator directly into the network. This framework uses Wasserstein GANs to
improve training stability in combination with regularisation terms that combat
mode collapse, which are typical problems for conditional GANs. This approach
takes as input the dirty image and the point spread function (PSF) of the
observation and provides efficient, high-quality image reconstructions that are
robust to varying visibility coverages, generalises to images with an increased
dynamic range, and provides informative uncertainty quantification. Our methods
provide a significant step toward computationally efficient, scalable, and
uncertainty-aware imaging for next-generation radio telescopes.

Abstract: Modeling and evaluation of automated vehicles (AVs) in mixed-autonomy traffic
is essential prior to their safe and efficient deployment. This is especially
important at urban junctions where complex multi-agent interactions occur.
Current approaches for modeling vehicular maneuvers and interactions at urban
junctions have limitations in formulating non-cooperative interactions and
vehicle dynamics within a unified mathematical framework. Previous studies
either assume predefined paths or rely on cooperation and central
controllability, limiting their realism and applicability in mixed-autonomy
traffic. This paper addresses these limitations by proposing a modeling
framework for trajectory planning and decentralized vehicular control at urban
junctions. The framework employs a bi-level structure where the upper level
generates kinematically feasible reference trajectories using an efficient
graph search algorithm with a custom heuristic function, while the lower level
employs a predictive controller for trajectory tracking and optimization.
Unlike existing approaches, our framework does not require central
controllability or knowledge sharing among vehicles. The vehicle kinematics are
explicitly incorporated at both levels, and acceleration and steering angle are
used as control variables. This intuitive formulation facilitates analysis of
traffic efficiency, environmental impacts, and motion comfort. The framework's
decentralized structure accommodates operational and stochastic elements, such
as vehicles' detection range, perception uncertainties, and reaction delay,
making the model suitable for safety analysis. Numerical and simulation
experiments across diverse scenarios demonstrate the framework's capability in
modeling accurate and realistic vehicular maneuvers and interactions at various
urban junctions, including unsignalized intersections and roundabouts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 互信息最优控制作为最大熵最优控制的扩展，其温度参数与策略随机性之间的关系尚未被探索，本文旨在填补这一理论空白。

Method: 通过扩展先前研究的结果，建立了MIOCP最优策略的存在性，并推导了温度参数使策略随机或确定的条件。

Result: 理论结果表明，温度参数的不同取值会导致策略的随机性或确定性，并通过数值实验验证了这些结论。

Conclusion: 本文为互信息最优控制中温度参数与策略随机性的关系提供了理论支持，并通过实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: In recent years, mutual information optimal control has been proposed as an
extension of maximum entropy optimal control. Both approaches introduce
regularization terms to render the policy stochastic, and it is important to
theoretically clarify the relationship between the temperature parameter (i.e.,
the coefficient of the regularization term) and the stochasticity of the
policy. Unlike in maximum entropy optimal control, this relationship remains
unexplored in mutual information optimal control. In this paper, we investigate
this relationship for a mutual information optimal control problem (MIOCP) of
discrete-time linear systems. After extending the result of a previous study of
the MIOCP, we establish the existence of an optimal policy of the MIOCP, and
then derive the respective conditions on the temperature parameter under which
the optimal policy becomes stochastic and deterministic. Furthermore, we also
derive the respective conditions on the temperature parameter under which the
policy obtained by an alternating optimization algorithm becomes stochastic and
deterministic. The validity of the theoretical results is demonstrated through
numerical experiments.

methods through numerical experiments on a representative machine learning

Result: 网络定量重现平衡和动力学特性，偏差仅几个百分点。

Conclusion: GANs在随机动力学建模中潜力大，但需注意外推限制。

Abstract: We show that Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) may be fruitfully
exploited to learn stochastic dynamics, surrogating traditional models while
capturing thermal fluctuations. Specifically, we showcase the application to a
two-dimensional, many-particle system, focusing on surface-step fluctuations
and on the related time-dependent roughness. After the construction of a
dataset based on Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, a conditional GAN is trained
to propagate stochastically the state of the system in time, allowing the
generation of new sequences with a reduced computational cost. Modifications
with respect to standard GANs, which facilitate convergence and increase
accuracy, are discussed. The trained network is demonstrated to quantitatively
reproduce equilibrium and kinetic properties, including scaling laws, with
deviations of a few percent from the exact value. Extrapolation limits and
future perspectives are critically discussed.

TL;DR: 该研究利用机器学习模型预测剖宫产后阴道分娩（VBAC）的成功率，基于CDC WONDER数据集，结果显示多层感知机（MLP）表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确预测剖宫产后阴道试产（TOLAC）的结果对产前咨询和降低分娩风险至关重要。

Method: 使用643,029例TOLAC病例数据，训练了逻辑回归、XGBoost和MLP三种分类器，并采用类别权重和自定义损失函数处理数据不平衡问题。

Result: MLP的AUC最高（0.7287），XGBoost次之（0.727），均优于逻辑回归（0.709）。关键预测因素包括BMI、教育水平和产前护理指标。

Conclusion: 研究表明，常规收集的早期妊娠变量可用于构建高性能的VBAC预测模型，支持临床决策。

Abstract: Accurately predicting the outcome of a trial of labor after cesarean (TOLAC)
is essential for guiding prenatal counseling and minimizing delivery-related
risks. This study presents supervised machine learning models for predicting
vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) using 643,029 TOLAC cases from the CDC
WONDER Natality dataset (2017-2023). After filtering for singleton births with
one or two prior cesareans and complete data across 47 prenatal-period
features, three classifiers were trained: logistic regression, XGBoost, and a
multilayer perceptron (MLP). The MLP achieved the highest performance with an
AUC of 0.7287, followed closely by XGBoost (AUC = 0.727), both surpassing the
logistic regression baseline (AUC = 0.709). To address class imbalance, class
weighting was applied to the MLP, and a custom loss function was implemented in
XGBoost. Evaluation metrics included ROC curves, confusion matrices, and
precision-recall analysis. Logistic regression coefficients highlighted
maternal BMI, education, parity, comorbidities, and prenatal care indicators as
key predictors. Overall, the results demonstrate that routinely collected,
early-pregnancy variables can support scalable and moderately high-performing
VBAC prediction models. These models offer potential utility in clinical
decision support, particularly in settings lacking access to specialized
intrapartum data.

Motivation: 解决临床预测模型在新医院部署时因数据分布变化导致的性能下降问题。

Method: 应用锚回归并引入锚提升（一种树基非线性扩展），在包含40万患者的9个ICU数据库上验证。

Result: 锚正则化显著提升了模型在分布外数据上的性能，尤其对差异较大的目标域效果明显。方法对理论假设的违反（如锚外生性）具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出了一个量化外部数据效用的框架，定义了三种数据利用模式：领域泛化、领域适应和数据丰富模式。

Abstract: The performance of predictive models in clinical settings often degrades when
deployed in new hospitals due to distribution shifts. This paper presents a
large-scale study of causality-inspired domain generalization on heterogeneous
multi-center intensive care unit (ICU) data. We apply anchor regression and
introduce anchor boosting, a novel, tree-based nonlinear extension, to a large
dataset comprising 400,000 patients from nine distinct ICU databases. The
anchor regularization consistently improves out-of-distribution performance,
particularly for the most dissimilar target domains. The methods appear robust
to violations of theoretical assumptions, such as anchor exogeneity.
Furthermore, we propose a novel conceptual framework to quantify the utility of
large external data datasets. By evaluating performance as a function of
available target-domain data, we identify three regimes: (i) a domain
generalization regime, where only the external model should be used, (ii) a
domain adaptation regime, where refitting the external model is optimal, and
(iii) a data-rich regime, where external data provides no additional value.

TL;DR: ST-DAI是一种单次框架，通过2.5D采样和域自适应插值，降低3D空间转录组学成本，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D空间转录组学中全采样成本高和现有方法依赖大数据集导致泛化性差的问题。

Method: 结合2.5D采样（中心全采样，相邻稀疏采样）和单次3D插值学习，使用域自适应技术（FMDR和PDLs）和伪监督生成。

Result: ST-DAI在降低测量负担的同时，性能接近全采样方法。

Conclusion: ST-DAI为3D空间转录组学提供了一种高效且成本低的解决方案。

Abstract: For 3D spatial transcriptomics (ST), the high per-section acquisition cost of
fully sampling every tissue section remains a significant challenge. Although
recent approaches predict gene expression from histology images, these methods
require large external datasets, which leads to high-cost and suffers from
substantial domain discrepancies that lead to poor generalization on new
samples. In this work, we introduce ST-DAI, a single-shot framework for 3D ST
that couples a cost-efficient 2.5D sampling scheme with an intra-sample
domain-adaptive imputation framework. First, in the cost-efficient 2.5D
sampling stage, one reference section (central section) is fully sampled while
other sections (adjacent sections) is sparsely sampled, thereby capturing
volumetric context at significantly reduced experimental cost. Second, we
propose a single-shot 3D imputation learning method that allows us to generate
fully sampled 3D ST from this cost-efficient 2.5D ST scheme, using only
sample-specific training. We observe position misalignment and domain
discrepancy between sections. To address those issues, we adopt a pipeline that
first aligns the central section to the adjacent section, thereafter generates
dense pseudo-supervision on the central section, and then performs Fast
Multi-Domain Refinement (FMDR), which adapts the network to the domain of the
adjacent section while fine-tuning only a few parameters through the use of
Parameter-Efficient Domain-Alignment Layers (PDLs). During this refinement, a
Confidence Score Generator (CSG) reweights the pseudo-labels according to their
estimated reliability, thereby directing imputation toward trustworthy regions.
Our experimental results demonstrate that ST-DAI achieves gene expression
prediction performance comparable to fully sampled approaches while
substantially reducing the measurement burden.

TL;DR: 论文提出VidFuncta框架，利用隐式神经表示（INRs）分析超声视频，解决了传统深度学习方法在非标准化采集和操作偏差下的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超声视频分析因非标准化采集和操作偏差而具有挑战性，传统深度学习方法难以处理。

Method: 基于Functa框架，提出VidFuncta，将超声视频编码为紧凑的时间分辨表示，分离静态和时间依赖调制向量。

Result: 在三个公开超声视频数据集上验证，VidFuncta在视频重建和下游任务（如射血分数预测、B线检测和乳腺病变分类）中优于2D和3D基线方法。

Conclusion: VidFuncta展示了作为超声视频通用高效表示框架的潜力。

Abstract: Ultrasound is widely used in clinical care, yet standard deep learning
methods often struggle with full video analysis due to non-standardized
acquisition and operator bias. We offer a new perspective on ultrasound video
analysis through implicit neural representations (INRs). We build on Functa, an
INR framework in which each image is represented by a modulation vector that
conditions a shared neural network. However, its extension to the temporal
domain of medical videos remains unexplored. To address this gap, we propose
VidFuncta, a novel framework that leverages Functa to encode variable-length
ultrasound videos into compact, time-resolved representations. VidFuncta
disentangles each video into a static video-specific vector and a sequence of
time-dependent modulation vectors, capturing both temporal dynamics and
dataset-level redundancies. Our method outperforms 2D and 3D baselines on video
reconstruction and enables downstream tasks to directly operate on the learned
1D modulation vectors. We validate VidFuncta on three public ultrasound video
datasets -- cardiac, lung, and breast -- and evaluate its downstream
performance on ejection fraction prediction, B-line detection, and breast
lesion classification. These results highlight the potential of VidFuncta as a
generalizable and efficient representation framework for ultrasound videos. Our
code is publicly available under

Abstract: Pancreatic cancer is projected to become the second-deadliest malignancy in
Western countries by 2030, highlighting the urgent need for better early
detection. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs), key precursors to
pancreatic cancer, are challenging to assess with current guidelines, often
leading to unnecessary surgeries or missed malignancies. We present Cyst-X, an
AI framework that predicts IPMN malignancy using multicenter MRI data,
leveraging MRI's superior soft tissue contrast over CT. Trained on 723 T1- and
738 T2-weighted scans from 764 patients across seven institutions, our models
(AUC=0.82) significantly outperform both Kyoto guidelines (AUC=0.75) and expert
radiologists. The AI-derived imaging features align with known clinical markers
and offer biologically meaningful insights. We also demonstrate strong
performance in a federated learning setting, enabling collaborative training
without sharing patient data. To promote privacy-preserving AI development and
improve IPMN risk stratification, the Cyst-X dataset is released as the first

Conclusion: Cardiac-CLIP为心血管诊断提供了高效的多模态基础模型，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Foundation models have demonstrated remarkable potential in medical domain.
However, their application to complex cardiovascular diagnostics remains
underexplored. In this paper, we present Cardiac-CLIP, a multi-modal foundation
model designed for 3D cardiac CT images. Cardiac-CLIP is developed through a
two-stage pre-training strategy. The first stage employs a 3D masked
autoencoder (MAE) to perform self-supervised representation learning from
large-scale unlabeled volumetric data, enabling the visual encoder to capture
rich anatomical and contextual features. In the second stage, contrastive
learning is introduced to align visual and textual representations,
facilitating cross-modal understanding. To support the pre-training, we collect
16641 real clinical CT scans, supplemented by 114k publicly available data.
Meanwhile, we standardize free-text radiology reports into unified templates
and construct the pathology vectors according to diagnostic attributes, based
on which the soft-label matrix is generated to supervise the contrastive
learning process. On the other hand, to comprehensively evaluate the
effectiveness of Cardiac-CLIP, we collect 6,722 real-clinical data from 12
independent institutions, along with the open-source data to construct the
evaluation dataset. Specifically, Cardiac-CLIP is comprehensively evaluated
across multiple tasks, including cardiovascular abnormality classification,
information retrieval and clinical analysis. Experimental results demonstrate
that Cardiac-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance across various
downstream tasks in both internal and external data. Particularly, Cardiac-CLIP
exhibits great effectiveness in supporting complex clinical tasks such as the
prospective prediction of acute coronary syndrome, which is notoriously
difficult in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: We present ReXGroundingCT, the first publicly available dataset to link
free-text radiology findings with pixel-level segmentations in 3D chest CT
scans that is manually annotated. While prior datasets have relied on
structured labels or predefined categories, ReXGroundingCT captures the full
expressiveness of clinical language represented in free text and grounds it to
spatially localized 3D segmentation annotations in volumetric imaging. This
addresses a critical gap in medical AI: the ability to connect complex,
descriptive text, such as "3 mm nodule in the left lower lobe", to its precise
anatomical location in three-dimensional space, a capability essential for
grounded radiology report generation systems. The dataset comprises 3,142
non-contrast chest CT scans paired with standardized radiology reports from the
CT-RATE dataset. Using a systematic three-stage pipeline, GPT-4 was used to
extract positive lung and pleural findings, which were then manually segmented
by expert annotators. A total of 8,028 findings across 16,301 entities were
annotated, with quality control performed by board-certified radiologists.
Approximately 79% of findings are focal abnormalities, while 21% are non-focal.
The training set includes up to three representative segmentations per finding,
while the validation and test sets contain exhaustive labels for each finding
entity. ReXGroundingCT establishes a new benchmark for developing and
evaluating sentence-level grounding and free-text medical segmentation models
in chest CT. The dataset can be accessed at

Cross-species targeted pre-training on disease-relevant mammalian genomes
(human, pig, mouse), leveraging evolutionary conservation to enhance

Germline mutation specialization via fine-tuning on ClinVar and HGMD, improving
accuracy for both SNVs and non-SNVs; (3) Interpretable clinical framework
integrating DNA sequence embeddings with LLM-based statistical explanations to
provide actionable insights. Validated against ClinVar, EnTao-GPM demonstrates
superior accuracy in mutation classification. It revolutionizes genetic testing
by enabling faster, more accurate, and accessible interpretation for clinical

Abstract: We implement a quantum generalization of a neural network on trapped-ion and
IBM superconducting quantum computers to classify MNIST images, a common
benchmark in computer vision. The network feedforward involves qubit rotations
whose angles depend on the results of measurements in the previous layer. The
network is trained via simulation, but inference is performed experimentally on
quantum hardware. The classical-to-quantum correspondence is controlled by an
interpolation parameter, $a$, which is zero in the classical limit. Increasing
$a$ introduces quantum uncertainty into the measurements, which is shown to
improve network performance at moderate values of the interpolation parameter.
We then focus on particular images that fail to be classified by a classical
neural network but are detected correctly in the quantum network. For such
borderline cases, we observe strong deviations from the simulated behavior. We
attribute this to physical noise, which causes the output to fluctuate between
nearby minima of the classification energy landscape. Such strong sensitivity
to physical noise is absent for clear images. We further benchmark physical
noise by inserting additional single-qubit and two-qubit gate pairs into the
neural network circuits. Our work provides a springboard toward more complex
quantum neural networks on current devices: while the approach is rooted in
standard classical machine learning, scaling up such networks may prove
classically non-simulable and could offer a route to near-term quantum
advantage.

Motivation: 大数据和人工智能时代对高效数据处理的需求推动了量子图像处理（QIP）的发展，以解决复杂计算挑战。

Method: 比较了四种量子图像表示（TNR、FRQI、NEQR、QPIE）的压缩性能，并评估了量子内核在分类任务中的表现。

Result: FRQI在图像压缩方面表现最佳；量子内核分类精度与经典方法相当，但存储需求显著降低。

Conclusion: 量子图像处理在压缩和分类任务中具有潜力，尤其是FRQI和量子内核的高效性值得进一步研究。

Abstract: In the era of big data and artificial intelligence, the increasing volume of
data and the demand to solve more and more complex computational challenges are
two driving forces for improving the efficiency of data storage, processing and
analysis. Quantum image processing (QIP) is an interdisciplinary field between
quantum information science and image processing, which has the potential to
alleviate some of these challenges by leveraging the power of quantum
computing. In this work, we compare and examine the compression properties of
four different Quantum Image Representations (QImRs): namely, Tensor Network
Representation (TNR), Flexible Representation of Quantum Image (FRQI), Novel
Enhanced Quantum Representation NEQR, and Quantum Probability Image Encoding
(QPIE). Our simulations show that FRQI performs a higher compression of image
information than TNR, NEQR, and QPIE. Furthermore, we investigate the trade-off
between accuracy and memory in binary classification problems, evaluating the
performance of quantum kernels based on QImRs compared to the classical linear
kernel. Our results indicate that quantum kernels provide comparable
classification average accuracy but require exponentially fewer resources for
image storage.

Conclusion: 信息几何优化在量子机器学习中具有潜力，特别是在标准方法失效的场景。

Abstract: We develop a quantum version of the em algorithm for training quantum
Boltzmann machines. The em algorithm is an information-geometric extension of
the well-known expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, offering a structured
alternative to gradient-based methods with potential advantages in stability
and convergence. We implement the algorithm on a semi-quantum restricted
Boltzmann machine, where quantum effects are confined to the hidden layer. This
structure enables analytical update rules while preserving quantum
expressivity. Numerical experiments on benchmark datasets show that the
proposed method achieves stable learning and outperforms gradient-based
training in several cases. These results demonstrate the potential of
information-geometric optimization for quantum machine learning, particularly
in settings where standard methods struggle due to non-commutativity or
vanishing gradients.

TL;DR: 提出量子Koopman方法（QKM），通过将非线性动力学转化为高维可观测空间中的线性酉演化，实现量子加速模拟非线性现象。


<details>

Motivation: 量子计算在非线性动力学中的应用受限于酉演化的要求，QKM旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 利用Koopman算子理论实现全局线性化，通过深度自编码器将系统状态映射到希尔伯特空间，分解为模和相位分量，由数据学习的对角哈密顿量构造酉Koopman算子。

Result: 在多种非线性系统中验证，预测误差低于6%，并捕捉到2D湍流的关键统计特性。

Conclusion: QKM为量子加速模拟非线性现象提供了实用框架，结合深度学习和量子算法的优势。

Abstract: Quantum computation offers potential exponential speedups for simulating
certain physical systems, but its application to nonlinear dynamics is
inherently constrained by the requirement of unitary evolution. We propose the
quantum Koopman method (QKM), a data-driven framework that bridges this gap
through transforming nonlinear dynamics into linear unitary evolution in
higher-dimensional observable spaces. Leveraging the Koopman operator theory to
achieve a global linearization, our approach maps system states into a
hierarchy of Hilbert spaces using a deep autoencoder. Within the linearized
embedding spaces, the state representation is decomposed into modulus and phase
components, and the evolution is governed by a set of unitary Koopman operators
that act exclusively on the phase. These operators are constructed from
diagonal Hamiltonians with coefficients learned from data, a structure designed
for efficient implementation on quantum hardware. This architecture enables
direct multi-step prediction, and the operator's computational complexity
scales logarithmically with the observable space dimension. The QKM is
validated across diverse nonlinear systems. Its predictions maintain relative
errors below 6% for reaction-diffusion systems and shear flows, and capture key
statistics in 2D turbulence. This work establishes a practical pathway for
quantum-accelerated simulation of nonlinear phenomena, exploring a framework
built on the synergy between deep learning for global linearization and quantum
algorithms for unitary dynamics evolution.

Result: 实验表明，微调后的LLMs在生成有效合同时准确率高，减少人工工作量超过70%。

Conclusion: 生成式AI能够通过弥合意图与实现之间的差距，实现可扩展、敏捷的数据治理。

Abstract: Data contracts formalize agreements between data producers and consumers
regarding schema, semantics, and quality expectations. As data pipelines grow
in complexity, manual authoring and maintenance of contracts becomes
error-prone and labor-intensive. We present an AI-driven framework for
automatic data contract generation using large language models (LLMs). Our
system leverages parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, including LoRA and
PEFT, to adapt LLMs to structured data domains. The models take sample data or
schema descriptions and output validated contract definitions in formats such
as JSON Schema and Avro. We integrate this framework into modern data platforms
(e.g., Databricks, Snowflake) to automate contract enforcement at scale.
Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the
fine-tuned LLMs achieve high accuracy in generating valid contracts and reduce
manual workload by over 70%. We also discuss key challenges such as
hallucination, version control, and the need for continuous learning. This work
demonstrates that generative AI can enable scalable, agile data governance by
bridging the gap between intent and implementation in enterprise data
management.

TL;DR: 研究发现人类视觉和语言相似性判断基于共享的、模态无关的表征结构，与视觉系统编码经验的方式一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索视觉和语言是否共享表征空间，以及这种空间如何体现在人类行为中。

Method: 63名参与者对100张自然场景图像和100个对应句子进行相似性判断，并与fMRI脑响应和计算模型结果对比。

Result: 视觉和语言相似性判断在行为层面收敛，并预测相似的fMRI脑响应网络；基于LLM的计算模型优于其他模型。

Conclusion: 人类视觉和语言共享模态无关的表征结构，反映了外部世界的稳定关系属性。

Abstract: Humans can effortlessly describe what they see, yet establishing a shared
representational format between vision and language remains a significant
challenge. Emerging evidence suggests that human brain representations in both
vision and language are well predicted by semantic feature spaces obtained from
large language models (LLMs). This raises the possibility that sensory systems
converge in their inherent ability to transform their inputs onto shared,
embedding-like representational space. However, it remains unclear how such a
space manifests in human behaviour. To investigate this, sixty-three
participants performed behavioural similarity judgements separately on 100
natural scene images and 100 corresponding sentence captions from the Natural
Scenes Dataset. We found that visual and linguistic similarity judgements not
only converge at the behavioural level but also predict a remarkably similar
network of fMRI brain responses evoked by viewing the natural scene images.
Furthermore, computational models trained to map images onto LLM-embeddings
outperformed both category-trained and AlexNet controls in explaining the
behavioural similarity structure. These findings demonstrate that human visual
and linguistic similarity judgements are grounded in a shared,
modality-agnostic representational structure that mirrors how the visual system
encodes experience. The convergence between sensory and artificial systems
suggests a common capacity of how conceptual representations are formed-not as
arbitrary products of first order, modality-specific input, but as structured
representations that reflect the stable, relational properties of the external
world.

Method: 提出DLRS算法，基于训练过程中的损失值动态调整学习率，并在物理信息神经网络（PINNs）和图像分类任务中进行了实验验证。

Result: 实验结果表明，DLRS能够加速训练过程并提高训练稳定性。

Conclusion: 动态学习率调度器（DLRS）是一种有效的自适应学习率调整方法，适用于复杂神经网络训练任务。

Abstract: Training neural networks can be challenging, especially as the complexity of
the problem increases. Despite using wider or deeper networks, training them
can be a tedious process, especially if a wrong choice of the hyperparameter is
made. The learning rate is one of such crucial hyperparameters, which is
usually kept static during the training process. Learning dynamics in complex
systems often requires a more adaptive approach to the learning rate. This
adaptability becomes crucial to effectively navigate varying gradients and
optimize the learning process during the training process. In this paper, a
dynamic learning rate scheduler (DLRS) algorithm is presented that adapts the
learning rate based on the loss values calculated during the training process.
Experiments are conducted on problems related to physics-informed neural
networks (PINNs) and image classification using multilayer perceptrons and
convolutional neural networks, respectively. The results demonstrate that the
proposed DLRS accelerates training and improves stability.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive progress, their

domain understanding and limited reasoning capabilities. In this work, we focus
on the specific field of chemistry and develop a Chemical Reasoner LLM,
ChemDFM-R. We first construct a comprehensive dataset of atomized knowledge

logical structure of chemistry. Then, we propose a mix-sourced distillation
strategy that integrates expert-curated knowledge with general-domain reasoning
skills, followed by domain-specific reinforcement learning to enhance chemical
reasoning. Experiments on diverse chemical benchmarks demonstrate that
ChemDFM-R achieves state-of-the-art performance while providing interpretable,

reasoning chains significantly improve the reliability, transparency, and
practical utility of the model in real-world human-AI collaboration scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DGF技术依赖启发式算法优化适应度指标，缺乏对未执行路径的预见性，导致难以处理复杂约束路径，效率低下。

Method: 提出路径转移模型，利用深度神经网络构建虚拟集成环境（VEE）预测路径转移奖励，开发强化学习模型（RLF）生成最优路径转移序列，并通过动作组优化关键步骤。

Result: DeepGo能够高效生成最优路径，显著提升模糊测试的效率和目标到达率。

Conclusion: DeepGo通过结合预测和历史信息，优化路径选择和突变策略，显著提升了定向灰盒模糊测试的性能。

Abstract: The state-of-the-art DGF techniques redefine and optimize the fitness metric
to reach the target sites precisely and quickly. However, optimizations for
fitness metrics are mainly based on heuristic algorithms, which usually rely on
historical execution information and lack foresight on paths that have not been
exercised yet. Thus, those hard-to-execute paths with complex constraints would
hinder DGF from reaching the targets, making DGF less efficient. In this paper,
we propose DeepGo, a predictive directed grey-box fuzzer that can combine
historical and predicted information to steer DGF to reach the target site via
an optimal path. We first propose the path transition model, which models DGF
as a process of reaching the target site through specific path transition
sequences. The new seed generated by mutation would cause the path transition,
and the path corresponding to the high-reward path transition sequence
indicates a high likelihood of reaching the target site through it. Then, to
predict the path transitions and the corresponding rewards, we use deep neural
networks to construct a Virtual Ensemble Environment (VEE), which gradually
imitates the path transition model and predicts the rewards of path transitions
that have not been taken yet. To determine the optimal path, we develop a
Reinforcement Learning for Fuzzing (RLF) model to generate the transition
sequences with the highest sequence rewards. The RLF model can combine
historical and predicted path transitions to generate the optimal path
transition sequences, along with the policy to guide the mutation strategy of
fuzzing. Finally, to exercise the high-reward path transition sequence, we
propose the concept of an action group, which comprehensively optimizes the
critical steps of fuzzing to realize the optimal path to reach the target
efficiently.

Motivation: 传统软件架构设计依赖人工，耗时且设计选择有限，尤其在敏捷开发中。LLM在SE任务中表现优异，但在架构设计中的应用仍需探索。

Method: 提出MAAD框架，使用四个智能体（分析师、建模师、设计师和评估师）协作完成架构设计和评估。

Result: MAAD在生成全面架构组件和结构化评估报告方面优于MetaGPT，工业反馈证实其实用性。GPT-4o在LLM中表现最佳。

Conclusion: MAAD为自动化架构设计提供了有效解决方案，LLM选择对多智能体系统驱动的设计至关重要。

Abstract: Software architecture design is a critical, yet inherently complex and
knowledge-intensive phase of software development. It requires deep domain
expertise, development experience, architectural knowledge, careful trade-offs
among competing quality attributes, and the ability to adapt to evolving
requirements. Traditionally, this process is time-consuming and
labor-intensive, and relies heavily on architects, often resulting in limited
design alternatives, especially under the pressures of agile development. While
Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have shown promising performance across
various SE tasks, their application to architecture design remains relatively
scarce and requires more exploration, particularly in light of diverse domain
knowledge and complex decision-making. To address the challenges, we proposed
MAAD (Multi-Agent Architecture Design), an automated framework that employs a
knowledge-driven Multi-Agent System (MAS) for architecture design. MAAD
orchestrates four specialized agents (i.e., Analyst, Modeler, Designer and
Evaluator) to collaboratively interpret requirements specifications and produce
architectural blueprints enriched with quality attributes-based evaluation
reports. We then evaluated MAAD through a case study and comparative
experiments against MetaGPT, a state-of-the-art MAS baseline. Our results show
that MAAD's superiority lies in generating comprehensive architectural
components and delivering insightful and structured architecture evaluation
reports. Feedback from industrial architects across 11 requirements
specifications further reinforces MAAD's practical usability. We finally
explored the performance of the MAAD framework with three LLMs (GPT-4o,
DeepSeek-R1, and Llama 3.3) and found that GPT-4o exhibits better performance
in producing architecture design, emphasizing the importance of LLM selection
in MAS-driven architecture design.

Motivation: HLS代码调试对新手和软件工程师极具挑战性，LLMs的应用潜力巨大但面临数据稀缺、逻辑复杂和测试用例缺失等问题。

Method: HLSDebugger生成30万标记数据集，采用编码器-解码器结构，同时完成错误定位、类型预测和修正。

Result: HLSDebugger在错误识别和修正上显著优于GPT-4，修正效率提升3倍以上。

Conclusion: HLSDebugger为HLS代码自动化调试提供了重要进展。

Abstract: High-level synthesis (HLS) accelerates hardware design by enabling the
automatic translation of high-level descriptions into efficient hardware
implementations. However, debugging HLS code is a challenging and
labor-intensive task, especially for novice circuit designers or software
engineers without sufficient hardware domain knowledge. The recent emergence of
Large Language Models (LLMs) is promising in automating the HLS debugging
process. Despite the great potential, three key challenges persist when
applying LLMs to HLS logic debugging: 1) High-quality circuit data for training
LLMs is scarce, posing a significant challenge. 2) Debugging logic bugs in
hardware is inherently more complex than identifying software bugs with
existing golden test cases. 3) The absence of reliable test cases requires
multi-tasking solutions, performing both bug identification and correction.
complicates the multi-tasking required for effective HLS debugging. In this
work, we propose a customized solution named HLSDebugger to address the
challenges. HLSDebugger first generates and releases a large labeled dataset
with 300K data samples, targeting HLS logic bugs. The HLSDebugger model adopts
an encoder-decoder structure, performing bug location identification, bug type
prediction, and bug correction with the same model. HLSDebugger significantly
outperforms advanced LLMs like GPT-4 in bug identification and by more than 3x
in bug correction. It makes a substantial advancement in the exploration of
automated debugging of HLS code.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) rapidly advance, their role in code
generation has expanded significantly. While this offers streamlined
development, it also creates concerns in areas like education and job
interviews. Consequently, developing robust systems to detect AI-generated code
is imperative to maintain academic integrity and ensure fairness in hiring
processes. In this study, we introduce MultiAIGCD, a dataset for AI-generated
code detection for Python, Java, and Go. From the CodeNet dataset's problem
definitions and human-authored codes, we generate several code samples in Java,
Python, and Go with six different LLMs and three different prompts. This
generation process covered three key usage scenarios: (i) generating code from
problem descriptions, (ii) fixing runtime errors in human-written code, and
(iii) correcting incorrect outputs. Overall, MultiAIGCD consists of 121,271
AI-generated and 32,148 human-written code snippets. We also benchmark three

Conclusion: 提出了以人类、技术和组织为中心的研究议程，指导未来对这一范式的探索。

Abstract: Software development is undergoing a fundamental transformation as vibe
coding becomes widespread, with large portions of contemporary codebases now
being AI-generated. The disconnect between rapid adoption and limited
conceptual understanding highlights the need for an inquiry into this emerging
paradigm. Drawing on an intent perspective and historical analysis, we define
vibe coding as a software development paradigm where humans and generative AI
engage in collaborative flow to co-create software artifacts through natural
language dialogue, shifting the mediation of developer intent from
deterministic instruction to probabilistic inference. By intent mediation, we
refer to the fundamental process through which developers translate their
conceptual goals into representations that computational systems can execute.
Our results show that vibe coding reconfigures cognitive work by redistributing
epistemic labor between humans and machines, shifting the expertise in the
software development process away from traditional areas such as design or
technical implementation toward collaborative orchestration. We identify key
opportunities, including democratization, acceleration, and systemic leverage,
alongside risks, such as black box codebases, responsibility gaps, and
ecosystem bias. We conclude with a research agenda spanning human-,
technology-, and organization-centered directions to guide future
investigations of this paradigm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言编程中跨语言错误（CLBs）难以检测，现有单语言工具无法有效解决，因此探索CodeLMs的潜力。

Method: 开发CLCFinder工具，构建包含三种编程语言组合和九种交互类型的CLB数据集，微调13种CodeLMs并评估性能。

Result: 微调后CodeLMs性能显著提升，UniXcoder-base表现最佳（F1=0.7407）。小型模型优于大型模型，数据集大小对性能影响显著。

Conclusion: CodeLMs在CLB检测中具有潜力，但需针对性微调。小型模型和更大数据集是关键因素。

Abstract: Multilingual programming, which involves using multiple programming languages
(PLs) in a single project, is increasingly common due to its benefits. However,
it introduces cross-language bugs (CLBs), which arise from interactions between
different PLs and are difficult to detect by single-language bug detection
tools. This paper investigates the potential of pre-trained code language
models (CodeLMs) in CLB detection. We developed CLCFinder, a cross-language
code identification tool, and constructed a CLB dataset involving three PL
combinations (Python-C/C++, Java-C/C++, and Python-Java) with nine interaction
types. We fine-tuned 13 CodeLMs on this dataset and evaluated their
performance, analyzing the effects of dataset size, token sequence length, and
code comments. Results show that all CodeLMs performed poorly before
fine-tuning, but exhibited varying degrees of performance improvement after
fine-tuning, with UniXcoder-base achieving the best F1 score (0.7407). Notably,
small fine-tuned CodeLMs tended to performe better than large ones. CodeLMs
fine-tuned on single-language bug datasets performed poorly on CLB detection,
demonstrating the distinction between CLBs and single-language bugs.
Additionally, increasing the fine-tuning dataset size significantly improved
performance, while longer token sequences did not necessarily improve the model
performance. The impact of code comments varied across models. Some fine-tuned
CodeLMs' performance was improved, while others showed degraded performance.

Abstract: Reservoir Computing is a machine learning approach that uses the rich
repertoire of complex system dynamics for function approximation. Current
approaches to reservoir computing use a network of coupled integrating neurons
that require a steady current to maintain activity. Here, we introduce a small
world graph of differentiating neurons that are active only when there are
changes in input as an alternative to integrating neurons as a reservoir
computing substrate. We find the coupling strength and network topology that
enable these small world networks to function as an effective reservoir. We
demonstrate the efficacy of these networks in the MNIST digit recognition task,
achieving comparable performance of 90.65% to existing reservoir computing
approaches. The findings suggest that differentiating neurons can be a
potential alternative to integrating neurons and can provide a sustainable
future alternative for power-hungry AI applications.

Motivation: 当前循环神经网络依赖隐式记忆，限制了其解释性和长程依赖建模能力。受生物神经系统的启发，作者希望通过显式记忆和Hebbian可塑性改进这一点。

Method: ENN架构引入了显式、可微的记忆矩阵，结合Hebbian可塑性和稀疏注意力驱动的检索机制。

Result: ENN在MNIST、CIFAR-10和WikiText-103任务上表现与传统RNN、GRU和LSTM相当，同时显著提升了模型解释性。

Conclusion: ENN通过显式记忆和Hebbian可塑性，验证了神经科学机制对开发更可解释和鲁棒深度学习模型的潜力。

Abstract: Despite success across diverse tasks, current artificial recurrent network
architectures rely primarily on implicit hidden-state memories, limiting their
interpretability and ability to model long-range dependencies. In contrast,
biological neural systems employ explicit, associative memory traces (i.e.,
engrams) strengthened through Hebbian synaptic plasticity and activated
sparsely during recall. Motivated by these neurobiological insights, we
introduce the Engram Neural Network (ENN), a novel recurrent architecture
incorporating an explicit, differentiable memory matrix with Hebbian plasticity
and sparse, attention-driven retrieval mechanisms. The ENN explicitly models
memory formation and recall through dynamic Hebbian traces, improving
transparency and interpretability compared to conventional RNN variants. We
evaluate the ENN architecture on three canonical benchmarks: MNIST digit
classification, CIFAR-10 image sequence modeling, and WikiText-103 language
modeling. Our empirical results demonstrate that the ENN achieves accuracy and
generalization performance broadly comparable to classical RNN, GRU, and LSTM
architectures, with all models converging to similar accuracy and perplexity on
the large-scale WikiText-103 task. At the same time, the ENN offers significant
enhancements in interpretability through observable memory dynamics. Hebbian
trace visualizations further reveal biologically plausible, structured memory
formation processes, validating the potential of neuroscience-inspired
mechanisms to inform the development of more interpretable and robust deep
learning models.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于半监督自归一化神经网络（SS-NN）的广义少样本迁移学习架构，用于优化掺铒光纤放大器（EDFA）的增益谱预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着网络向多供应商解决方案发展，准确建模EDFA增益谱对优化光网络性能至关重要。

Method: 采用两阶段训练策略：无监督预训练（噪声增强测量）和有监督微调（自定义加权MSE损失）。通过迁移学习技术实现同质和异质模型适应，并引入协方差匹配损失解决异质迁移中的特征不匹配问题。

Result: 在26个EDFA上的实验表明，该方法显著减少了测量需求，同时实现了更低的平均绝对误差和更好的误差分布。

Conclusion: 所提出的SS-NN模型结合迁移学习技术，有效提升了EDFA增益谱预测的准确性和适应性。

Abstract: Accurate modeling of the gain spectrum in Erbium-Doped Fiber Amplifiers
(EDFAs) is essential for optimizing optical network performance, particularly
as networks evolve toward multi-vendor solutions. In this work, we propose a
generalized few-shot transfer learning architecture based on a Semi-Supervised
Self-Normalizing Neural Network (SS-NN) that leverages internal EDFA features -
such as VOA input or output power and attenuation, to improve gain spectrum
prediction. Our SS-NN model employs a two-phase training strategy comprising
unsupervised pre-training with noise-augmented measurements and supervised
fine-tuning with a custom weighted MSE loss. Furthermore, we extend the
framework with transfer learning (TL) techniques that enable both homogeneous
(same-feature space) and heterogeneous (different-feature sets) model
adaptation across booster, preamplifier, and ILA EDFAs. To address feature
mismatches in heterogeneous TL, we incorporate a covariance matching loss to
align second-order feature statistics between source and target domains.
Extensive experiments conducted across 26 EDFAs in the COSMOS and Open Ireland
testbeds demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly reduces the
number of measurements requirements on the system while achieving lower mean
absolute errors and improved error distributions compared to benchmark methods.

*Wei Mao,Lili Wei,Omid Semiari,Shu-ping Yeh,Hosein Nikopour*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 3GPP Release 18的Cell DTX/DRX是一种5G网络节能技术，通过周期性聚合用户数据传输以减少能耗，但会增加数据包延迟。本文利用深度强化学习（DRL）优化配置，平衡节能与延迟，实验结果显示节能可达45%，同时服务质量（QoS）下降不超过1%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何在5G网络中通过Cell DTX/DRX技术最大化节能效果，同时最小化对延迟敏感流量的服务质量（QoS）影响。

Method: 采用深度强化学习（DRL）框架，结合深度Q网络（DQN）和上下文赌博机（CB）模型，设计平滑奖励函数，训练AI代理动态选择最优配置。

Result: 实验表明，AI代理在不同网络和流量条件下可实现高达45%的节能效果，同时QoS下降不超过1%。

Conclusion: 通过DRL优化的Cell DTX/DRX配置能有效平衡节能与服务质量，为5G网络提供了一种高效的节能解决方案。

Abstract: 3GPP Release 18 cell discontinuous transmission and reception (cell DTX/DRX)
is an important new network energy saving feature for 5G. As a time-domain
technique, it periodically aggregates the user data transmissions in a given
duration of time when the traffic load is not heavy, so that the remaining time
can be kept silent and advanced sleep modes (ASM) can be enabled to shut down
more radio components and save more energy for the cell. However, inevitably
the packet delay is increased, as during the silent period no transmission is
allowed. In this paper we study how to configure cell DTX/DRX to optimally
balance energy saving and packet delay, so that for delay-sensitive traffic
maximum energy saving can be achieved while the degradation of quality of
service (QoS) is minimized. As the optimal configuration can be different for
different network and traffic conditions, the problem is complex and we resort
to deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to train an AI agent to solve
it. Through careful design of 1) the learning algorithm, which implements a
deep Q-network (DQN) on a contextual bandit (CB) model, and 2) the reward
function, which utilizes a smooth approximation of a theoretically optimal but
discontinuous reward function, we are able to train an AI agent that always
tries to select the best possible Cell DTX/DRX configuration under any network
and traffic conditions. Simulation results show that compared to the case when
cell DTX/DRX is not used, our agent can achieve up to ~45% energy saving
depending on the traffic load scenario, while always maintaining no more than
~1% QoS degradation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有新闻摘要方法主要依赖文本内容和类似日期的文章，缺乏对事件中利益相关者的分析，导致效果不佳。因此，需要一种新方法来评估利益相关者的重要性及相关事件的联系。

Method: 提出SUnSET框架，利用大型语言模型（LLMs）构建SET（利益相关者、事件、时间）三元组，并引入基于利益相关者的排名方法，构建“相关性”指标。

Result: 实验结果表明，SUnSET在所有基线方法中表现最佳，成为新的最先进方法，突出了利益相关者信息在新闻文章中的重要性。

Conclusion: SUnSET通过整合利益相关者、事件和时间信息，显著提升了时间线摘要任务的性能，证明了利益相关者分析在新闻摘要中的关键作用。

Abstract: As news reporting becomes increasingly global and decentralized online,
tracking related events across multiple sources presents significant
challenges. Existing news summarization methods typically utilizes Large
Language Models and Graphical methods on article-based summaries. However, this
is not effective since it only considers the textual content of similarly dated
articles to understand the gist of the event. To counteract the lack of
analysis on the parties involved, it is essential to come up with a novel
framework to gauge the importance of stakeholders and the connection of related
events through the relevant entities involved. Therefore, we present SUnSET:
Synergistic Understanding of Stakeholder, Events and Time for the task of
Timeline Summarization (TLS). We leverage powerful Large Language Models (LLMs)
to build SET triplets and introduced the use of stakeholder-based ranking to
construct a $Relevancy$ metric, which can be extended into general situations.
Our experimental results outperform all prior baselines and emerged as the new
State-of-the-Art, highlighting the impact of stakeholder information within
news article.

Abstract: Understanding the behavior and evolution of a dynamical many-body system by
analyzing patterns in their experimentally captured images is a promising
method relevant for a variety of living and non-living self-assembled systems.
The arrays of moving liquid crystal skyrmions studied here are a representative
example of hierarchically organized materials that exhibit complex
spatiotemporal dynamics driven by multiscale processes. Joint geometric and
topological data analysis (TDA) offers a powerful framework for investigating
such systems by capturing the underlying structure of the data at multiple
scales. In the TDA approach, we introduce the $\Psi$-function, a robust
numerical topological descriptor related to both the spatiotemporal changes in
the size and shape of individual topological solitons and the emergence of
regions with their different spatial organization. The geometric method based
on the analysis of vector fields generated from images of skyrmion ensembles
offers insights into the nonlinear physical mechanisms of the system's response
to external stimuli and provides a basis for comparison with theoretical
predictions. The methodology presented here is very general and can provide a
characterization of system behavior both at the level of individual
pattern-forming agents and as a whole, allowing one to relate the results of
image data analysis to processes occurring in a physical, chemical, or
biological system in the real world.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 商业扩散模型在图像合成中的成功引发了版权保护和不当内容生成的问题，现有水印方法对RST攻击脆弱且容量低。

Method: 利用初始噪声嵌入水印，并注入X形模板以恢复RST失真，避免使用重复环形模式。

Result: 在验证和识别场景下，MaXsive在两个知名水印基准测试中表现出色。

Conclusion: MaXsive显著提升了水印的鲁棒性和容量，降低了身份冲突的可能性。

Abstract: The great success of the diffusion model in image synthesis led to the
release of gigantic commercial models, raising the issue of copyright
protection and inappropriate content generation. Training-free diffusion
watermarking provides a low-cost solution for these issues. However, the prior
works remain vulnerable to rotation, scaling, and translation (RST) attacks.
Although some methods employ meticulously designed patterns to mitigate this
issue, they often reduce watermark capacity, which can result in identity (ID)
collusion. To address these problems, we propose MaXsive, a training-free
diffusion model generative watermarking technique that has high capacity and
robustness. MaXsive best utilizes the initial noise to watermark the diffusion
model. Moreover, instead of using a meticulously repetitive ring pattern, we
propose injecting the X-shape template to recover the RST distortions. This
design significantly increases robustness without losing any capacity, making
ID collusion less likely to happen. The effectiveness of MaXsive has been
verified on two well-known watermarking benchmarks under the scenarios of
verification and identification.

Abstract: Steganalysis methods based on deep learning (DL) often struggle with
computational complexity and challenges in generalizing across different
datasets. Incorporating a graph neural network (GNN) into steganalysis schemes
enables the leveraging of relational data for improved detection accuracy and
adaptability. This paper presents the first application of a Graph Neural
Network (GNN), specifically the GraphSAGE architecture, for steganalysis of
compressed voice over IP (VoIP) speech streams. The method involves
straightforward graph construction from VoIP streams and employs GraphSAGE to
capture hierarchical steganalysis information, including both fine grained
details and high level patterns, thereby achieving high detection accuracy.
Experimental results demonstrate that the developed approach performs well in
uncovering quantization index modulation (QIM)-based steganographic patterns in
VoIP signals. It achieves detection accuracy exceeding 98 percent even for
short 0.5 second samples, and 95.17 percent accuracy under challenging
conditions with low embedding rates, representing an improvement of 2.8 percent
over the best performing state of the art methods. Furthermore, the model
exhibits superior efficiency, with an average detection time as low as 0.016
seconds for 0.5-second samples an improvement of 0.003 seconds. This makes it
efficient for online steganalysis tasks, providing a superior balance between
detection accuracy and efficiency under the constraint of short samples with
low embedding rates.

Abstract: The rapid integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into medical
diagnostics has raised pressing concerns about patient privacy, especially when
sensitive imaging data must be transferred, stored, or processed. In this
paper, we propose a novel framework for privacy-preserving diagnostic inference
on encrypted medical images using a modified convolutional neural network
(Masked-CNN) capable of operating on transformed or ciphered image formats. Our
approach leverages AES-CBC encryption coupled with JPEG2000 compression to
protect medical images while maintaining their suitability for AI inference. We
evaluate the system using public DICOM datasets (NIH ChestX-ray14 and
LIDC-IDRI), focusing on diagnostic accuracy, inference latency, storage
efficiency, and privacy leakage resistance. Experimental results show that the
encrypted inference model achieves performance comparable to its unencrypted
counterpart, with only marginal trade-offs in accuracy and latency. The
proposed framework bridges the gap between data privacy and clinical utility,
offering a practical, scalable solution for secure AI-driven diagnostics.

Abstract: Adversarial attack methods for 3D point cloud classification reveal the
vulnerabilities of point cloud recognition models. This vulnerability could
lead to safety risks in critical applications that use deep learning models,
such as autonomous vehicles. To uncover the deficiencies of these models,
researchers can evaluate their security through adversarial attacks. However,
most existing adversarial attack methods are based on white-box attacks. While
these methods achieve high attack success rates and imperceptibility, their
applicability in real-world scenarios is limited. Black-box attacks, which are
more meaningful in real-world scenarios, often yield poor results. This paper
proposes a novel black-box adversarial example generation method that utilizes
a diffusion model to improve the attack success rate and imperceptibility in
the black-box setting, without relying on the internal information of the point
cloud classification model to generate adversarial samples. We use a 3D
diffusion model to use the compressed features of the point cloud as prior
knowledge to guide the reverse diffusion process to add adversarial points to
clean examples. Subsequently, its reverse process is employed to transform the
distribution of other categories into adversarial points, which are then added
to the point cloud.

Motivation: 现有联邦学习防御方法因忽视模型对后门触发器的过度依赖而效果有限，尤其是恶意客户端比例增加时。

Method: 提出扰动触发器生成机制，生成与后门触发器匹配的扰动触发器；利用这些触发器生成良性对抗扰动；设计自适应缩放机制动态调整扰动强度。

Result: 实验显示，FedBAP在三种后门攻击下分别降低了攻击成功率0.22%-5.34%、0.48%-6.34%和97.22%-97.6%。

Conclusion: FedBAP能有效抵御后门攻击，尤其在新攻击中表现突出。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training while preserving
data privacy, but it is highly vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Most existing
defense methods in FL have limited effectiveness due to their neglect of the
model's over-reliance on backdoor triggers, particularly as the proportion of
malicious clients increases. In this paper, we propose FedBAP, a novel defense
framework for mitigating backdoor attacks in FL by reducing the model's
reliance on backdoor triggers. Specifically, first, we propose a perturbed
trigger generation mechanism that creates perturbation triggers precisely
matching backdoor triggers in location and size, ensuring strong influence on
model outputs. Second, we utilize these perturbation triggers to generate
benign adversarial perturbations that disrupt the model's dependence on
backdoor triggers while forcing it to learn more robust decision boundaries.
Finally, we design an adaptive scaling mechanism to dynamically adjust
perturbation intensity, effectively balancing defense strength and model
performance. The experimental results demonstrate that FedBAP reduces the
attack success rates by 0.22%-5.34%, 0.48%-6.34%, and 97.22%-97.6% under three
types of backdoor attacks, respectively. In particular, FedBAP demonstrates
outstanding performance against novel backdoor attacks.

Abstract: Next generation Radio Access Networks (RANs) introduce programmability,
intelligence, and near real-time control through intelligent controllers,
enabling enhanced security within the RAN and across broader 5G/6G
infrastructures. This paper presents a comprehensive survey highlighting
opportunities, challenges, and research gaps for Large Language Models
(LLMs)-assisted explainable (XAI) intrusion detection (IDS) for secure future

anomaly-based detection system for distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks
using multivariate time series key performance measures (KPMs), extracted from
E2 nodes, within the Near Real-Time RAN Intelligent Controller (Near-RT RIC).
An LSTM-based model is trained to identify malicious User Equipment (UE)
behavior based on these KPMs. To enhance transparency, we apply post-hoc local
explainability methods such as LIME and SHAP to interpret individual
predictions. Furthermore, LLMs are employed to convert technical explanations
into natural-language insights accessible to non-expert users. Experimental
results on real 5G network KPMs demonstrate that our framework achieves high

Conclusion: Hot-Swap MarkBoard是一种高效、适应性强的水印方法，适用于大规模模型分发场景。

Abstract: Recently, Deep Learning (DL) models have been increasingly deployed on
end-user devices as On-Device AI, offering improved efficiency and privacy.
However, this deployment trend poses more serious Intellectual Property (IP)
risks, as models are distributed on numerous local devices, making them
vulnerable to theft and redistribution. Most existing ownership protection
solutions (e.g., backdoor-based watermarking) are designed for cloud-based
AI-as-a-Service (AIaaS) and are not directly applicable to large-scale
distribution scenarios, where each user-specific model instance must carry a
unique watermark. These methods typically embed a fixed watermark, and
modifying the embedded watermark requires retraining the model. To address
these challenges, we propose Hot-Swap MarkBoard, an efficient watermarking
method. It encodes user-specific $n$-bit binary signatures by independently
embedding multiple watermarks into a multi-branch Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
module, enabling efficient watermark customization without retraining through
branch swapping. A parameter obfuscation mechanism further entangles the
watermark weights with those of the base model, preventing removal without
degrading model performance. The method supports black-box verification and is
compatible with various model architectures and DL tasks, including
classification, image generation, and text generation. Extensive experiments
across three types of tasks and six backbone models demonstrate our method's
superior efficiency and adaptability compared to existing approaches, achieving
100\% verification accuracy.

of both methodology and terminology, we demonstrate that the trilemma rests on
semantic equivocation, misuse of distributed systems theory, and a failure to
define operational metrics. Particular focus is placed on the conflation of
topological network analogies with protocol-level architecture, the
mischaracterisation of Bitcoin's design--including the role of miners, SPV
clients, and header-based verification--and the failure to ground claims in
complexity-theoretic or adversarial models. By reconstructing Bitcoin as a
deterministic, stateless distribution protocol governed by evidentiary trust,
we show that scalability is not a trade-off but an engineering outcome. The
paper concludes by identifying systemic issues in academic discourse and peer
review that have allowed such fallacies to persist, and offers formal criteria
for evaluating future claims in blockchain research.

TL;DR: 本文系统综述了深度伪造检测的最新方法，强调可复现性和对抗性鲁棒性的不足，并呼吁未来研究关注可扩展的多模态架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度伪造技术的快速发展对数字安全、信息真实性和身份保护构成挑战，亟需有效的检测方法。

Method: 分为两种核心范式：1) 基于统计异常和分层特征提取的全合成媒体检测；2) 利用多模态线索（如视觉伪影和时间不一致性）定位真实内容中的篡改区域。

Result: 现有方法在受控环境中表现良好，但对对抗性扰动的鲁棒性不足，影响实际应用可靠性。

Conclusion: 未来研究需优先提升对抗性鲁棒性，开发可扩展的多模态架构，以应对日益复杂的深度伪造威胁。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Generative Artificial Intelligence has fueled
deepfake proliferation-synthetic media encompassing fully generated content and
subtly edited authentic material-posing challenges to digital security,
misinformation mitigation, and identity preservation. This systematic review
evaluates state-of-the-art deepfake detection methodologies, emphasizing
reproducible implementations for transparency and validation. We delineate two
core paradigms: (1) detection of fully synthetic media leveraging statistical
anomalies and hierarchical feature extraction, and (2) localization of
manipulated regions within authentic content employing multi-modal cues such as
visual artifacts and temporal inconsistencies. These approaches, spanning
uni-modal and multi-modal frameworks, demonstrate notable precision and
adaptability in controlled settings, effectively identifying manipulations
through advanced learning techniques and cross-modal fusion. However,
comprehensive assessment reveals insufficient evaluation of adversarial
robustness across both paradigms. Current methods exhibit vulnerability to
adversarial perturbations-subtle alterations designed to evade
detection-undermining reliability in real-world adversarial contexts. This gap
highlights critical disconnect between methodological development and evolving
threat landscapes. To address this, we contribute a curated GitHub repository
aggregating open-source implementations, enabling replication and testing. Our
findings emphasize urgent need for future work prioritizing adversarial
resilience, advocating scalable, modality-agnostic architectures capable of
withstanding sophisticated manipulations. This review synthesizes strengths and
shortcomings of contemporary deepfake detection while charting paths toward
robust trustworthy systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于软件安全中ROP技术的新型越狱框架，通过将有害指令分解为多个看似无害的视觉片段，利用LVLMs的组合推理能力生成有害输出。实验表明该方法在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）安全对齐机制仍易受复杂对抗攻击，尤其是利用模型多步推理中的漏洞。本文旨在揭示并利用这种组合推理的脆弱性。

Method: 提出一种受ROP启发的越狱框架，将有害指令分解为多个无害的视觉片段，并通过精心设计的文本提示引导模型组合这些片段生成有害输出。

Result: 在SafeBench和MM-SafetyBench等基准测试中，该方法攻击成功率接近完美（超过0.90），并显著提升ASR（最高提升0.39）。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LVLMs组合推理能力的严重漏洞，强调了保护整个推理过程的防御措施的紧迫性。

Abstract: The increasing sophistication of large vision-language models (LVLMs) has
been accompanied by advances in safety alignment mechanisms designed to prevent
harmful content generation. However, these defenses remain vulnerable to
sophisticated adversarial attacks. Existing jailbreak methods typically rely on
direct and semantically explicit prompts, overlooking subtle vulnerabilities in
how LVLMs compose information over multiple reasoning steps. In this paper, we
propose a novel and effective jailbreak framework inspired by Return-Oriented
Programming (ROP) techniques from software security. Our approach decomposes a
harmful instruction into a sequence of individually benign visual gadgets. A
carefully engineered textual prompt directs the sequence of inputs, prompting
the model to integrate the benign visual gadgets through its reasoning process
to produce a coherent and harmful output. This makes the malicious intent
emergent and difficult to detect from any single component. We validate our
method through extensive experiments on established benchmarks including
SafeBench and MM-SafetyBench, targeting popular LVLMs. Results show that our
approach consistently and substantially outperforms existing baselines on
state-of-the-art models, achieving near-perfect attack success rates (over 0.90
on SafeBench) and improving ASR by up to 0.39. Our findings reveal a critical
and underexplored vulnerability that exploits the compositional reasoning
abilities of LVLMs, highlighting the urgent need for defenses that secure the
entire reasoning process.

Motivation: 评估机器学习模型对训练数据的隐私泄露风险，特别是在低误报率下的隐私风险。

Method: CMIA通过条件影子训练利用实例间的成员依赖关系；PMIA通过代理选择策略利用相似样本行为进行推理。

Result: 实验表明CMIA和PMIA在两种设置下均显著优于现有方法，尤其在低误报率下表现突出。

Conclusion: CMIA和PMIA为成员推理攻击提供了更高效的框架，尤其在隐私风险评估中具有重要意义。

Abstract: A Membership Inference Attack (MIA) assesses how much a trained machine
learning model reveals about its training data by determining whether specific
query instances were included in the dataset. We classify existing MIAs into
adaptive or non-adaptive, depending on whether the adversary is allowed to
train shadow models on membership queries. In the adaptive setting, where the
adversary can train shadow models after accessing query instances, we highlight
the importance of exploiting membership dependencies between instances and
propose an attack-agnostic framework called Cascading Membership Inference
Attack (CMIA), which incorporates membership dependencies via conditional
shadow training to boost membership inference performance.
  In the non-adaptive setting, where the adversary is restricted to training
shadow models before obtaining membership queries, we introduce Proxy
Membership Inference Attack (PMIA). PMIA employs a proxy selection strategy
that identifies samples with similar behaviors to the query instance and uses
their behaviors in shadow models to perform a membership posterior odds test
for membership inference. We provide theoretical analyses for both attacks, and
extensive experimental results demonstrate that CMIA and PMIA substantially
outperform existing MIAs in both settings, particularly in the low
false-positive regime, which is crucial for evaluating privacy risks.

significance rates under role-based threats, alongside substantial performance
enhancements in numerous cases with effect sizes up to +1336%. Statistical

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业环境中隐私合规性信息分散且难以提取，需要一种统一的方法来连接和分析这些资源。

Method: PACT利用DRAGON嵌入模型和对比学习目标，通过微调连接不同资源的文本组件。

Result: PACT显著提升了召回率、查询匹配率和候选选择命中率。

Conclusion: PACT通过嵌入驱动的图模型有效解决了企业隐私合规性信息分散的问题。

Abstract: Enterprise environments contain a heterogeneous, rapidly growing collection
of internal artifacts related to code, data, and many different tools. Critical
information for assessing privacy risk and ensuring regulatory compliance is
often embedded across these varied resources, each with their own arcane
discovery and extraction techniques. Therefore, large-scale privacy compliance
in adherence to governmental regulations requires systems to discern the
interconnected nature of diverse artifacts in a common, shared universe.
  We present Privacy Artifact ConnecT or (PACT), an embeddings-driven graph
that links millions of artifacts spanning multiple artifact types generated by
a variety of teams and projects. Powered by the state-of-the-art DRAGON
embedding model, PACT uses a contrastive learning objective with light
fine-tuning to link artifacts via their textual components such as raw
metadata, ownership specifics, and compliance context. Experimental results
show that PACT's fine-tuned model improves recall@1 from 18% to 53%, the query
match rate from 9.6% to 69.7% when paired with a baseline AI agent, and the
hitrate@1 from 25.7% to 44.9% for candidate selection in a standard recommender
system.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多智能体系统的普及，其间的信任机制可能被恶意利用，导致系统级的安全风险，需要深入研究并提出防御方案。

Method: 通过定义ACI攻击向量，分析其传播链和放大效应，并基于OWASP的风险分类提出评估方法。

Result: ACI攻击可能导致系统级故障，需通过标准化测试框架评估多智能体系统的安全性。

Conclusion: 论文呼吁开发定量评估工具，以提升多智能体系统的安全性，并提供了初步的方法论。

Abstract: Evolving AI systems increasingly deploy multi-agent architectures where
autonomous agents collaborate, share information, and delegate tasks through
developing protocols. This connectivity, while powerful, introduces novel
security risks. One such risk is a cascading risk: a breach in one agent can
cascade through the system, compromising others by exploiting inter-agent
trust. In tandem with OWASP's initiative for an Agentic AI Vulnerability
Scoring System we define an attack vector, Agent Cascading Injection, analogous
to Agent Impact Chain and Blast Radius, operating across networks of agents. In
an ACI attack, a malicious input or tool exploit injected at one agent leads to
cascading compromises and amplified downstream effects across agents that trust
its outputs. We formalize this attack with an adversarial goal equation and key
variables (compromised agent, injected exploit, polluted observations, etc.),
capturing how a localized vulnerability can escalate into system-wide failure.
We then analyze ACI's properties -- propagation chains, amplification factors,
and inter-agent compound effects -- and map these to OWASP's emerging Agentic
AI risk categories (e.g. Impact Chain and Orchestration Exploits). Finally, we
argue that ACI highlights a critical need for quantitative benchmarking
frameworks to evaluate the security of agent-to-agent communication protocols.
We outline a methodology for stress-testing multi-agent systems (using
architectures such as Google's A2A and Anthropic's MCP) against cascading trust
failures, developing upon groundwork for measurable, standardized
agent-to-agent security evaluation. Our work provides the necessary apparatus
for engineers to benchmark system resilience, make data-driven architectural
trade-offs, and develop robust defenses against a new generation of agentic
threats.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源大语言模型（LLMs）的安全对齐方法容易被恶意微调绕过，需要新的防御策略。

Method: 通过理论分析揭示了恶意微调成功的原因，并提出SDD框架，使模型对有害提示生成高质量但不相关的回答，从而降低其通用能力。

Result: 实验证明SDD能有效抵御恶意微调攻击。

Conclusion: SDD框架为开源LLMs提供了一种有效的防御手段，防止其被恶意利用。

Abstract: Open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) often employ safety alignment
methods to resist harmful instructions. However, recent research shows that
maliciously fine-tuning these LLMs on harmful data can easily bypass these
safeguards. To counter this, we theoretically uncover why malicious fine-tuning
succeeds and identify potential defense strategies. Building on the theoretical
analysis, we introduce the Self-Degraded Defense (SDD) framework. SDD
encourages LLMs to produce high-quality but irrelevant responses to harmful
prompts. When attackers attempt malicious fine-tuning, the general capability
of the LLM aligned by SDD will significantly decrease, rendering it incapable
of following harmful instructions. Our experimental results confirm SDD's
effectiveness against such attacks.

Motivation: 神经网络容易受到对抗样本的攻击，但目前缺乏评估其鲁棒性的方法。

Result: 实验表明，NCCR能有效评估神经网络及其输入的鲁棒性，并检测对抗样本。

Conclusion: NCCR为评估神经网络对抗攻击能力和对抗样本稳定性提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Neural networks have received a lot of attention recently, and related
security issues have come with it. Many studies have shown that neural networks
are vulnerable to adversarial examples that have been artificially perturbed
with modification, which is too small to be distinguishable by human
perception. Different attacks and defenses have been proposed to solve these
problems, but there is little research on evaluating the robustness of neural
networks and their inputs. In this work, we propose a metric called the neuron
cover change rate (NCCR) to measure the ability of deep learning models to
resist attacks and the stability of adversarial examples. NCCR monitors
alterations in the output of specifically chosen neurons when the input is
perturbed, and networks with a smaller degree of variation are considered to be
more robust. The results of the experiment on image recognition and the speaker
recognition model show that our metrics can provide a good assessment of the
robustness of neural networks or their inputs. It can also be used to detect
whether an input is adversarial or not, as adversarial examples are always less
robust.

TL;DR: GUARD-CAN是一个结合图表示学习和时间序列建模的异常检测框架，用于保护车载网络免受CAN攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代车载网络因CAN缺乏加密和认证而面临多种网络威胁，需要一种有效的安全解决方案。

Method: GUARD-CAN将CAN消息分窗并转换为图，利用过完备自编码器和图卷积网络生成图嵌入向量，再通过GRU检测时间异常。

Result: 模型能有效检测四种CAN攻击（洪泛、模糊、重放和欺骗攻击），无需复杂特征工程。

Conclusion: GUARD-CAN通过多视角性能评估和窗口大小分析，证明了其在CAN安全中的有效性。

Abstract: Modern in-vehicle networks face various cyber threats due to the lack of
encryption and authentication in the Controller Area Network (CAN). To address
this security issue, this paper presents GUARD-CAN, an anomaly detection
framework that combines graph-based representation learning with time-series
modeling. GUARD-CAN splits CAN messages into fixed-length windows and converts
each window into a graph that preserves message order. To detect anomalies in
the timeaware and structure-aware context at the same window, GUARD-CAN takes
advantage of the overcomplete Autoencoder (AE) and Graph Convolutional Network
(GCN) to generate graph embedding vectors. The model groups these vectors into
sequences and feeds them into the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to detect temporal
anomaly patterns across the graphs. GUARD-CAN performs anomaly detection at
both the sequence level and the window level, and this allows multi-perspective
performance evaluation. The model also verifies the importance of window size
selection through an analysis based on Shannon entropy. As a result, GUARD-CAN
shows that the proposed model detects four types of CAN attacks (flooding,
fuzzing, replay and spoofing attacks) effectively without relying on complex
feature engineering.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SecTOW的迭代防御-攻击训练方法，通过强化学习增强多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的安全性，解决了现有防御方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的安全性面临挑战，特别是针对不安全图像-查询对的攻击。现有防御方法依赖外部模块或导致过度拒绝无害输入，无法从根本上解决问题。

Method: SecTOW采用迭代训练方法，包含防御者和辅助攻击者两个模块，通过强化学习（GRPO）相互训练。攻击者识别防御模型的漏洞并扩展攻击数据，防御者利用扩展数据提升安全性。

Result: 实验表明，SecTOW在安全性和通用性能上均显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SecTOW通过迭代训练和强化学习，有效提升了MLLMs的安全性，同时避免了过度拒绝无害输入的问题。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has led to
breakthroughs in various applications, yet their security remains a critical
challenge. One pressing issue involves unsafe image-query pairs--jailbreak
inputs specifically designed to bypass security constraints and elicit
unintended responses from MLLMs. Compared to general multimodal data, such
unsafe inputs are relatively sparse, which limits the diversity and richness of
training samples available for developing robust defense models. Meanwhile,
existing guardrail-type methods rely on external modules to enforce security
constraints but fail to address intrinsic vulnerabilities within MLLMs.
Traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT), on the other hand, often over-refuses
harmless inputs, compromising general performance. Given these challenges, we
propose Secure Tug-of-War (SecTOW), an innovative iterative defense-attack
training method to enhance the security of MLLMs. SecTOW consists of two
modules: a defender and an auxiliary attacker, both trained iteratively using
reinforcement learning (GRPO). During the iterative process, the attacker
identifies security vulnerabilities in the defense model and expands jailbreak
data. The expanded data are then used to train the defender, enabling it to
address identified security vulnerabilities. We also design reward mechanisms
used for GRPO to simplify the use of response labels, reducing dependence on
complex generative labels and enabling the efficient use of synthetic data.
Additionally, a quality monitoring mechanism is used to mitigate the defender's
over-refusal of harmless inputs and ensure the diversity of the jailbreak data
generated by the attacker. Experimental results on safety-specific and general
benchmarks demonstrate that SecTOW significantly improves security while
preserving general performance.

this paper we investigate the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to reason
about trust between two individuals in an environment which requires fostering
trust relationships. We also assess whether LLMs are capable of inducing trust
by role-playing one party in a trust based interaction and planning actions
which can instil trust.

Abstract: Industrial assembly tasks increasingly demand rapid adaptation to complex
procedures and varied components, yet are often conducted in environments with
limited computing, connectivity, and strict privacy requirements. These
constraints make conventional cloud-based or fully autonomous solutions
impractical for factory deployment. This paper introduces a mobile-device-based
assistant system for industrial training and operational support, enabling
real-time, semi-hands-free interaction through on-device perception and voice
interfaces. The system integrates lightweight object detection, speech
recognition, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) into a modular on-device
pipeline that operates entirely on-device, enabling intuitive support for part
handling and procedure understanding without relying on manual supervision or
cloud services. To enable scalable training, we adopt an automated data
construction pipeline and introduce a two-stage refinement strategy to improve
visual robustness under domain shift. Experiments on our generated dataset,
i.e., Gear8, demonstrate improved robustness to domain shift and common visual
corruptions. A structured user study further confirms its practical viability,
with positive user feedback on the clarity of the guidance and the quality of
the interaction. These results indicate that our framework offers a deployable
solution for real-time, privacy-preserving smart assistance in industrial
environments. We will release the Gear8 dataset and source code upon
acceptance.

Motivation: 社交媒体主动审核技术常被批评为审查，且未能解决不文明行为的根源。研究旨在通过情绪监控工具改善用户互动。

Method: 研究设计了两种情绪监控仪表板，并在211名参与者中评估其对评论行为和情绪体验的影响。

Result: 干预措施提升了用户情绪意识并减少了仇恨言论，但也增加了讨论敏感话题时的负面情绪表达。

Conclusion: 研究为社交媒体整合情绪调节工具提供了基础，以促进更健康的数字互动。

Abstract: Social media platforms increasingly employ proactive moderation techniques,
such as detecting and curbing toxic and uncivil comments, to prevent the spread
of harmful content. Despite these efforts, such approaches are often criticized
for creating a climate of censorship and failing to address the underlying
causes of uncivil behavior. Our work makes both theoretical and practical
contributions by proposing and evaluating two types of emotion monitoring
dashboards to users' emotional awareness and mitigate hate speech. In a study
involving 211 participants, we evaluate the effects of the two mechanisms on
user commenting behavior and emotional experiences. The results reveal that
these interventions effectively increase users' awareness of their emotional
states and reduce hate speech. However, our findings also indicate potential
unintended effects, including increased expression of negative emotions (Angry,
Fear, and Sad) when discussing sensitive issues. These insights provide a basis
for further research on integrating proactive emotion regulation tools into
social media platforms to foster healthier digital interactions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决科学可视化中复杂任务的认知负担，并实现动态扩展和用户友好的交互。

Result: 显著降低了复杂体积数据集的可视化任务认知负担，提升了灵活性和可重复性。

Conclusion: VizGenie通过动态学习和用户交互，推动了科学可视化的可持续发展和高效探索。

Abstract: We present VizGenie, a self-improving, agentic framework that advances
scientific visualization through large language model (LLM) by orchestrating of
a collection of domain-specific and dynamically generated modules. Users
initially access core functionalities--such as threshold-based filtering, slice
extraction, and statistical analysis--through pre-existing tools. For tasks
beyond this baseline, VizGenie autonomously employs LLMs to generate new
visualization scripts (e.g., VTK Python code), expanding its capabilities
on-demand. Each generated script undergoes automated backend validation and is
seamlessly integrated upon successful testing, continuously enhancing the
system's adaptability and robustness. A distinctive feature of VizGenie is its
intuitive natural language interface, allowing users to issue high-level
feature-based queries (e.g., ``visualize the skull"). The system leverages
image-based analysis and visual question answering (VQA) via fine-tuned vision
models to interpret these queries precisely, bridging domain expertise and
technical implementation. Additionally, users can interactively query generated
visualizations through VQA, facilitating deeper exploration. Reliability and
reproducibility are further strengthened by Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG), providing context-driven responses while maintaining comprehensive
provenance records. Evaluations on complex volumetric datasets demonstrate
significant reductions in cognitive overhead for iterative visualization tasks.
By integrating curated domain-specific tools with LLM-driven flexibility,
VizGenie not only accelerates insight generation but also establishes a
sustainable, continuously evolving visualization practice. The resulting
platform dynamically learns from user interactions, consistently enhancing
support for feature-centric exploration and reproducible research in scientific
visualization.

Conclusion: FingerTip基准和所提方法为构建更用户导向的移动GUI代理提供了潜力，代码已开源。

Abstract: Mobile GUI agents are becoming critical tools for enhancing human-device
interaction efficiency, with multimodal large language models (MLLMs) emerging
as dominant paradigms in this domain. Current agents, however, are limited to
following explicit human instructions, resulting in insufficient capability for
proactive intent anticipation. Additionally, these agents fail to leverage the
contextual information associated with users during task execution, thereby
neglecting potentially vast differences in user preferences. To address these
challenges, we introduce the FingerTip benchmark. It contains two new tracks:
proactive task suggestions by analyzing environment observation and users'

*Qian Huang,Thijs Willems*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 研究探讨教育者如何通过定制GPT工具主动设计和使用生成式AI（Gen-AI）以支持定性研究方法教学，发现其能提升学生反思能力，但也带来认知负担。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补学生作为被动AI使用者的研究空白，并探索AI在定性方法教育中的潜力。

Method: 基于TPACK框架和行动研究方法，设计四种定制GPT工具，用于支持研究任务。

Result: 工具提升了学生的反思能力和访谈技巧，但也引发认知过载和数据沉浸不足的问题。

Conclusion: 教育者主导的AI设计能促进更有意义的教学整合，AI可作为认知伙伴支持主动学习。

Abstract: As generative AI (Gen-AI) tools become more prevalent in education, there is
a growing need to understand how educators, not just students, can actively
shape their design and use. This study investigates how two instructors
integrated four custom GPT tools into a Masters-level Qualitative Research
Methods course for Urban Planning Policy students. Addressing two key gaps: the
dominant framing of students as passive AI users, and the limited use of AI in
qualitative methods education. The study explores how Gen-AI can support
disciplinary learning when aligned with pedagogical intent. Drawing on the
Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework and action
research methodology, the instructors designed GPTs to scaffold tasks such as
research question formulation, interview practice, fieldnote analysis, and
design thinking. Thematic analysis of student reflections, AI chat logs, and
final assignments revealed that the tools enhanced student reflexivity,
improved interview techniques, and supported structured analytic thinking.
However, students also expressed concerns about cognitive overload, reduced
immersion in data, and the formulaic nature of AI responses. The study offers
three key insights: AI can be a powerful scaffold for active learning when
paired with human facilitation; custom GPTs can serve as cognitive partners in
iterative research practice; and educator-led design is critical to
pedagogically meaningful AI integration. This research contributes to emerging
scholarship on AI in higher education by demonstrating how empowering educators
to design custom tools can promote more reflective, responsible, and
collaborative learning with AI.

TL;DR: 论文提出神经包容性AI概念，指出当前AI研究中存在对自闭症群体的偏见，并开发了AUTALIC基准以改善数据表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI数据中对自闭症群体的偏见问题，推动神经包容性AI的发展。

Method: 通过实证实验研究标注者和LLMs，开发AUTALIC基准以评估或微调模型。

Result: 发现90%类人AI代理排斥自闭症视角，AUTALIC基准能有效捕捉反自闭症仇恨言论。

Conclusion: AUTALIC为未来神经包容性研究奠定了基础，呼吁AI开发者重视伦理考量。

Abstract: Biased data representation in AI marginalizes up to 75 million autistic
people worldwide through medical applications viewing autism as a deficit of
neurotypical social skills rather than an aspect of human diversity, and this
perspective is grounded in research questioning the humanity of autistic
people. Turing defined artificial intelligence as the ability to mimic human
communication, and as AI development increasingly focuses on human-like agents,
this benchmark remains popular. In contrast, we define Neuro-Inclusive AI as
datasets and systems that move away from mimicking humanness as a benchmark for
machine intelligence. Then, we explore the origins, prevalence, and impact of
anti-autistic biases in current research. Our work finds that 90% of human-like
AI agents exclude autistic perspectives, and AI creators continue to believe
ethical considerations are beyond the scope of their work. To improve the
autistic representation in data, we conduct empirical experiments with
annotators and LLMs, finding that binary labeling schemes sufficiently capture
the nuances of labeling anti-autistic hate speech. Our benchmark, AUTALIC, can
be used to evaluate or fine-tune models, and was developed to serve as a
foundation for more neuro-inclusive future work.

Motivation: 研究解释行为中的情感因素，以理解解释作为一种社会互动如何受情感影响。

Method: 开发了一个计算框架，模拟解释者如何考虑听众的情感反应，并通过医生向患者解释疾病的场景进行测试。

Result: 模型能较好地预测人类直觉，优于不考虑情感的模型，表明人们在解释时确实会考虑情感因素。

Conclusion: 情感在解释行为中扮演重要角色，未来的解释模型应考虑情感因素。

Abstract: Why do we give the explanations we do? Recent work has suggested that we
should think of explanation as a kind of cooperative social interaction,
between a why-question-asker and an explainer. Here, we apply this perspective
to consider the role that emotion plays in this social interaction. We develop
a computational framework for modeling explainers who consider the emotional
impact an explanation might have on a listener. We test our framework by using
it to model human intuitions about how a doctor might explain to a patient why
they have a disease, taking into account the patient's propensity for regret.
Our model predicts human intuitions well, better than emotion-agnostic
ablations, suggesting that people do indeed reason about emotion when giving
explanations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法（如博客、静态课程）难以支持对AI的深入理解和批判性思考，因此研究交互式模拟是否能提升AI素养。

Method: 通过605名参与者的对照研究，评估交互式AI教程对公平性、数据集代表性和语言模型偏见等概念的学习效果。

Result: 交互式模拟显著提升了AI素养，增强了知识迁移和自信心，但参与度与学习效果无关。

Conclusion: 交互式、探究驱动的方法能更好地帮助个人在日常生活中批判性地使用AI。

Abstract: As AI systems shape individual and societal decisions, fostering critical AI
literacy is essential. Traditional approaches, such as blog articles, static
lessons, and social media discussions, often fail to support deep conceptual
understanding and critical engagement. This study examines whether interactive
simulations can help learners think like a scientist by engaging them in
hypothesis testing, experimentation, and direct observation of AI behavior. In
a controlled study with 605 participants, we assess how interactive AI
tutorials impact learning of key concepts such as fairness, dataset
representativeness, and bias in language models. Results show that interactive
simulations effectively enhance AI literacy across topics, supporting greater
knowledge transfer and self-reported confidence, though engagement alone does
not predict learning. This work contributes to the growing field of AI literacy
education, highlighting how interactive, inquiry-driven methodologies can
better equip individuals to critically engage with AI in their daily lives.

Motivation: 现有可穿戴AI系统依赖用户主动触发或预定义任务知识，忽视了用户的实时心理状态。

Method: 基于认知理论，系统将感知信息建模为记忆项和情景，并通过编码机制（如置换和干扰）实时更新工作记忆模型。

Result: 在12名用户的实验中，ProMemAssist比基线系统提供了更精准的辅助，用户参与度更高。

Conclusion: 工作记忆建模能实现更细腻、上下文敏感的辅助，为设计更智能的主动代理提供了启示。

Abstract: Wearable AI systems aim to provide timely assistance in daily life, but
existing approaches often rely on user initiation or predefined task knowledge,
neglecting users' current mental states. We introduce ProMemAssist, a smart
glasses system that models a user's working memory (WM) in real-time using
multi-modal sensor signals. Grounded in cognitive theories of WM, our system
represents perceived information as memory items and episodes with encoding
mechanisms, such as displacement and interference. This WM model informs a
timing predictor that balances the value of assistance with the cost of
interruption. In a user study with 12 participants completing cognitively
demanding tasks, ProMemAssist delivered more selective assistance and received
higher engagement compared to an LLM baseline system. Qualitative feedback
highlights the benefits of WM modeling for nuanced, context-sensitive support,
offering design implications for more attentive and user-aware proactive
agents.

Method: 基于自我决定理论和用户体验研究，通过309名本科生的调查数据，使用偏最小二乘结构方程模型分析AI素养与工具感知的关系。

Result: AI素养（自我效能、概念理解和应用技能）显著预测工具可用性、满意度和参与度，进而影响学习效果；而先前的AI接触无显著影响。

Conclusion: AI素养而非接触经验塑造学生体验，设计应支持多样化素养水平，以创建包容且有效的AI学习环境。

Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools become increasingly embedded in higher
education, understanding how students interact with these systems is essential
to supporting effective learning. This study examines how students' AI literacy
and prior exposure to AI technologies shape their perceptions of Socratic Mind,
an interactive AI-powered formative assessment tool. Drawing on
Self-Determination Theory and user experience research, we analyze
relationships among AI literacy, perceived usability, satisfaction, engagement,
and perceived learning effectiveness. Data from 309 undergraduates in Computer
Science and Business courses were collected through validated surveys. Partial
least squares structural equation modeling showed that AI literacy - especially
self-efficacy, conceptual understanding, and application skills - significantly
predicts usability, satisfaction, and engagement. Usability and satisfaction,
in turn, strongly predict perceived learning effectiveness, while prior AI
exposure showed no significant effect. These findings highlight that AI
literacy, rather than exposure alone, shapes student experiences. Designers
should integrate adaptive guidance and user-centered features to support
diverse literacy levels, fostering inclusive, motivating, and effective
AI-based learning environments.

Motivation: 解决LLM代理在复杂任务中因缺乏对真实应用场景的理解而导致的无效规划和幻觉问题。

Method: 提出轨迹记忆机制和粗到细的任务规划方法，结合双LLM架构执行任务。

Result: 实验证明MapAgent在真实场景中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MapAgent通过记忆增强和上下文感知规划，显著提升了任务自动化效果。

Abstract: The recent advancement of autonomous agents powered by Large Language Models
(LLMs) has demonstrated significant potential for automating tasks on mobile
devices through graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Despite initial progress,
these agents still face challenges when handling complex real-world tasks.
These challenges arise from a lack of knowledge about real-life mobile
applications in LLM-based agents, which may lead to ineffective task planning
and even cause hallucinations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
LLM-based agent framework called MapAgent that leverages memory constructed
from historical trajectories to augment current task planning. Specifically, we
first propose a trajectory-based memory mechanism that transforms task
execution trajectories into a reusable and structured page-memory database.
Each page within a trajectory is extracted as a compact yet comprehensive
snapshot, capturing both its UI layout and functional context. Secondly, we
introduce a coarse-to-fine task planning approach that retrieves relevant pages
from the memory database based on similarity and injects them into the LLM
planner to compensate for potential deficiencies in understanding real-world
app scenarios, thereby achieving more informed and context-aware task planning.
Finally, planned tasks are transformed into executable actions through a task
executor supported by a dual-LLM architecture, ensuring effective tracking of
task progress. Experimental results in real-world scenarios demonstrate that
MapAgent achieves superior performance to existing methods. The code will be
open-sourced to support further research.

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: DeepFDM是一个可微分的有限差分框架，用于学习时间依赖偏微分方程（PDEs）中的空间变化系数。它通过将前向欧拉离散化嵌入卷积架构，实现了稳定性和一阶收敛性，并在多个PDE基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在处理PDEs中的空间变化系数时存在效率和精度问题，DeepFDM旨在提供一种高效、稳定且可解释的解决方案。

Method: DeepFDM将前向欧拉离散化嵌入卷积架构，通过CFL兼容的系数参数化确保稳定性和收敛性，模型权重直接对应PDE系数。

Result: 在多个PDE基准测试中，DeepFDM的归一化均方误差比Fourier Neural Operators、U-Nets和ResNets低1-2个数量级，训练周期减少10-20倍，参数减少5-50倍。

Conclusion: DeepFDM为数据驱动的参数PDE求解和识别提供了一种高效、稳健且透明的基准方法。

Abstract: We present DeepFDM, a differentiable finite-difference framework for learning
spatially varying coefficients in time-dependent partial differential equations
(PDEs). By embedding a classical forward-Euler discretization into a
convolutional architecture, DeepFDM enforces stability and first-order
convergence via CFL-compliant coefficient parameterizations. Model weights
correspond directly to PDE coefficients, yielding an interpretable
inverse-problem formulation. We evaluate DeepFDM on a benchmark suite of scalar
PDEs: advection, diffusion, advection-diffusion, reaction-diffusion and
inhomogeneous Burgers' equations-in one, two and three spatial dimensions. In
both in-distribution and out-of-distribution tests (quantified by the Hellinger
distance between coefficient priors), DeepFDM attains normalized mean-squared
errors one to two orders of magnitude smaller than Fourier Neural Operators,
U-Nets and ResNets; requires 10-20X fewer training epochs; and uses 5-50X fewer
parameters. Moreover, recovered coefficient fields accurately match
ground-truth parameters. These results establish DeepFDM as a robust,
efficient, and transparent baseline for data-driven solution and identification
of parametric PDEs.

Result: 传统方法简单但需特定假设，新方法提供异常值评分且更灵活有效，适用于多维数据。

Conclusion: 现代方法在灵活性和多维数据处理上优于传统方法，但需用户设置调参。

Abstract: This note investigates the problem of detecting outliers in longitudinal
data. It compares well-known methods used in official statistics with proposals
from the fields of data mining and machine learning that are based on the
distance between observations or binary partitioning trees. This is achieved by
applying the methods to panel survey data related to different types of
statistical units. Traditional methods are quite simple, enabling the direct
identification of potential outliers, but they require specific assumptions. In
contrast, recent methods provide only a score whose magnitude is directly
related to the likelihood of an outlier being present. All the methods require
the user to set a number of tuning parameters. However, the most recent methods
are more flexible and sometimes more effective than traditional methods. In
addition, these methods can be applied to multidimensional data.

Conclusion: 该框架具有通用性，可应用于其他系统，甚至可通过实验视频推断未知参数。

Abstract: We introduce a unified machine-learning framework designed to conveniently
tackle the temporal evolution of alloy microstructures under the influence of
an elastic field. This approach allows for the simultaneous extraction of
elastic parameters from a short trajectory and for the prediction of further
microstructure evolution under their influence. This is demonstrated by
focusing on spinodal decomposition in the presence of a lattice mismatch eta,
and by carrying out an extensive comparison between the ground-truth evolution
supplied by phase field simulations and the predictions of suitable
convolutional recurrent neural network architectures. The two tasks may then be
performed subsequently into a cascade framework. Under a wide spectrum of
misfit conditions, the here-presented cascade model accurately predicts eta and
the full corresponding microstructure evolution, also when approaching critical
conditions for spinodal decomposition. Scalability to larger computational
domain sizes and mild extrapolation errors in time (for time sequences five
times longer than the sampled ones during training) are demonstrated. The
proposed framework is general and can be applied beyond the specific,
prototypical system considered here as an example. Intriguingly, experimental
videos could be used to infer unknown external parameters, prior to simulating
further temporal evolution.

Abstract: Synthetic sequence-controlled polymers promise to transform polymer science
by combining the chemical versatility of synthetic polymers with the precise
sequence-mediated functionality of biological proteins. However, design of
these materials has proven extraordinarily challenging, because they lack the
massive datasets of closely related evolved molecules that accelerate design of
proteins. Here we report on a new Artifical Intelligence strategy to
dramatically reduce the amount of data necessary to accelerate these materials'
design. We focus on data connecting the repeat-unit-sequence of a
\emph{compatibilizer} molecule to its ability to reduce the interfacial tension
between distinct polymer domains. The optimal sequence of these molecules,
which are essential for applications such as mixed-waste polymer recycling,
depends strongly on variables such as concentration and chemical details of the
polymer. With current methods, this would demand an entirely distinct dataset
to enable design at each condition. Here we show that a deep neural network
trained on low-fidelity data for sequence/interfacial tension relations at one
set of conditions can be rapidly tuned to make higher-fidelity predictions at a
distinct set of conditions, requiring far less data that would ordinarily be
needed. This priming-and-tuning approach should allow a single low-fidelity
parent dataset to dramatically accelerate prediction and design in an entire
constellation of related systems. In the long run, it may also provide an
approach to bootstrapping quantitative atomistic design with AI insights from
fast, coarse simulations.

Motivation: 真实布料材料因多种加工过程（如缝合、染色、印花等）表现出复杂性和空间变化，传统有限元方法计算成本高且易出现膜锁定问题。

Method: 将布料离散化为质量-弹簧网络，通过新型力-冲量损失函数直接从运动数据中学习未知材料参数。

Result: 能够准确建模空间变化的材料特性，避免膜锁定问题，相比基于图和神经ODE的方法，训练更快、重建精度更高、泛化能力更强。

Conclusion: Mass-Spring Net框架为复杂布料模拟提供了一种高效、准确的替代方案，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Materials used in real clothing exhibit remarkable complexity and spatial
variation due to common processes such as stitching, hemming, dyeing, printing,
padding, and bonding. Simulating these materials, for instance using finite
element methods, is often computationally demanding and slow. Worse, such
methods can suffer from numerical artifacts called ``membrane locking'' that
makes cloth appear artificially stiff. Here we propose a general framework,
called Mass-Spring Net, for learning a simple yet efficient surrogate model
that captures the effects of these complex materials using only motion
observations. The cloth is discretized into a mass-spring network with unknown
material parameters that are learned directly from the motion data, using a
novel force-and-impulse loss function. Our approach demonstrates the ability to
accurately model spatially varying material properties from a variety of data
sources, and immunity to membrane locking which plagues FEM-based simulations.
Compared to graph-based networks and neural ODE-based architectures, our method
achieves significantly faster training times, higher reconstruction accuracy,
and improved generalization to novel dynamic scenarios.

Conclusion: AI在医疗中的应用需谨慎，以避免对医患关系的负面影响。

Abstract: In the much-celebrated book Deep Medicine, Eric Topol argues that the
development of artificial intelligence for health care will lead to a dramatic
shift in the culture and practice of medicine. In the next several decades, he
suggests, AI will become sophisticated enough that many of the everyday tasks
of physicians could be delegated to it. Topol is perhaps the most articulate
advocate of the benefits of AI in medicine, but he is hardly alone in spruiking
its potential to allow physicians to dedicate more of their time and attention
to providing empathetic care for their patients in the future. Unfortunately,
several factors suggest a radically different picture for the future of health
care. Far from facilitating a return to a time of closer doctor-patient
relationships, the use of medical AI seems likely to further erode therapeutic
relationships and threaten professional and patient satisfaction.

Conclusion: 多元时间序列分类方法在MOOC中预测学习者表现具有潜力，丰富的行为数据对提高预测准确性至关重要。

Abstract: MOOCs offer free and open access to a wide audience, but completion rates
remain low, often due to a lack of personalized content. To address this issue,
it is essential to predict learner performance in order to provide tailored
feedback. Behavioral traces-such as clicks and events-can be analyzed as time
series to anticipate learners' outcomes. This work compares multivariate time
series classification methods to identify at-risk learners at different stages
of the course (after 5, 10 weeks, etc.). The experimental evaluation, conducted
on the Open University Learning Analytics Dataset (OULAD), focuses on three
courses: two in STEM and one in SHS. Preliminary results show that the
evaluated approaches are promising for predicting learner failure in MOOCs. The
analysis also suggests that prediction accuracy is influenced by the amount of
recorded interactions, highlighting the importance of rich and diverse
behavioral data.

Conclusion: 该框架高效解决了多样化受众的新闻理解问题。

Abstract: In the interconnected world, news media are critical in conveying information
to public across diverse domains including technology, finance, and
agriculture. Journalists make efforts to present accurate information, however,
the interpretation of news often varies significantly among different audiences
due to their specific expertise and age. In this work, we investigate how to
identify these comprehension gaps and provide solutions to improve audiences
understanding of news content, particular to the aspects of articles outside
their primary domains of knowledge. We propose a agent-based framework using
large language models (LLMs) to simulate society communication behaviors, where
several agents can discuss news. These agents can be designed to be experts
from various occupation, or from different age group. Our results indicate that
this framework can identify confusions or even misunderstanding of news for the
agent through the iterative discussion process. Based on these accurate
identification, the framework can design a supplement material specific to
these agents on the news. Our results show that agents exhibit significantly
improved news understanding after receiving this material. These findings
highlight our framework's utility and efficiency in enhancing news
comprehension for diverse audiences by directly addressing their understanding
gap.

such as technical guidelines or legal value principles. However, these methods
tend to be disconnected from the specific contexts in which CAs operate,
potentially leading to misalignment with users interests. To address this
challenge, we propose a novel, bottom-up approach to value alignment, utilizing
the value ontology of the ISO Value-Based Engineering standard for ethical IT
design. We analyse 593 ethically sensitive system outputs identified from
16,908 conversational logs of a major European employment service CA to
identify core values and instances of value misalignment within real-world
interactions. The results revealed nine core values and 32 different value
misalignments that negatively impacted users. Our findings provide actionable
insights for CA providers seeking to address ethical challenges and achieve
more context-sensitive value alignment.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决战术视频中高噪声和弱结构条件下的语义理解和威胁检测问题。

Method: 结合谱嵌入、时间因果边建模和异构模态的判别路径推断，采用语义感知关键帧提取方法构建时间图。

Result: 在TACTIC-AVS和TACTIC-Voice数据集上，时间对齐准确率达89.3%，完整威胁链识别率超过85%，节点延迟在±150毫秒内。

Conclusion: 该方法提升了结构可解释性，适用于监控、防御和智能安全系统。

Abstract: This paper introduces TACTIC-GRAPHS, a system that combines spectral graph
theory and multimodal graph neural reasoning for semantic understanding and
threat detection in tactical video under high noise and weak structure. The
framework incorporates spectral embedding, temporal causal edge modeling, and
discriminative path inference across heterogeneous modalities. A semantic-aware
keyframe extraction method fuses visual, acoustic, and action cues to construct
temporal graphs. Using graph attention and Laplacian spectral mapping, the
model performs cross-modal weighting and causal signal analysis. Experiments on
TACTIC-AVS and TACTIC-Voice datasets show 89.3 percent accuracy in temporal
alignment and over 85 percent recognition of complete threat chains, with node
latency within plus-minus 150 milliseconds. The approach enhances structural
interpretability and supports applications in surveillance, defense, and
intelligent security systems.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 论文呼吁结合哲学思想，对生成式AI的可持续性进行实际可行的分析，弥补当前开发者对其生态影响评估的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI开发者对生成式AI的生态影响评估不足，尤其是大型语言模型（LLMs）和生成式AI（genAI）的环境影响。

Method: 提出结合哲学思想的实用方法，对生成式AI的可持续性进行全面分析。

Result: 当前对AI生态影响的分析多限于温室气体排放，缺乏全面性。

Conclusion: 需要通过哲学视角推动更全面的生成式AI可持续性评估。

Abstract: Philosophers of technology have recently started paying more attention to the
environmental impacts of AI, in particular of large language models (LLMs) and
generative AI (genAI) applications. Meanwhile, few developers of AI give
concrete estimates of the ecological impact of their models and products, and
even when they do so, their analysis is often limited to green house gas
emissions of certain stages of AI development or use. The current proposal
encourages practically viable analyses of the sustainability aspects of genAI
informed by philosophical ideas.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 研究探讨了AI在组织环境中的社会技术挑战，特别是信任问题，以空中交通控制为例。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文献缺乏对AI在组织中信任问题的研究，尤其是在安全关键领域。

Method: 通过民族志研究，分析空中交通控制中现有工具的使用情况。

Result: 揭示了AI在安全关键领域（如空中交通控制）中可信赖的需求。

Conclusion: 研究填补了AI信任问题的空白，为安全关键领域的AI应用提供了见解。

Abstract: Exploring the socio-technical challenges confronting the adoption of AI in
organisational settings is something that has so far been largely absent from
the related literature. In particular, research into requirements for
trustworthy AI typically overlooks how people deal with the problems of trust
in the tools that they use as part of their everyday work practices. This
article presents some findings from an ongoing ethnographic study of how
current tools are used in air traffic control work and what it reveals about
requirements for trustworthy AI in air traffic control and other
safety-critical application domains.

chatbot based on a large language model, to support higher educator in
generating quiz questions and assessing learners. Specifically, we explore
interactive prompting patterns to design an optimal AI-powered question bank
creation process. The generated questions are evaluated through a "Blind test"
survey sent to various stakeholders including lecturers and learners. Initial
results at the Banking Academy of Vietnam are relatively promising, suggesting
a potential direction to streamline the time and effort involved in assessing
learners at higher education institutes.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 论文反对AGI竞赛，认为其风险高、收益低，国际合作是更好的替代方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AGI竞赛的负面影响及其替代方案，以降低AI发展中的灾难性风险。

Method: 通过分析AGI竞赛的潜在风险和收益，提出国际合作和协调的替代方案。

Result: AGI竞赛会增加灾难性风险，国际合作能提供类似收益且风险更低。

Conclusion: AGI竞赛不符合任何人的利益，国际合作是更优选择。

Abstract: AGI Racing is the view that it is in the self-interest of major actors in AI
development, especially powerful nations, to accelerate their frontier AI
development to build highly capable AI, especially artificial general
intelligence (AGI), before competitors have a chance. We argue against AGI
Racing. First, the downsides of racing to AGI are much higher than portrayed by
this view. Racing to AGI would substantially increase catastrophic risks from
AI, including nuclear instability, and undermine the prospects of technical AI
safety research to be effective. Second, the expected benefits of racing may be
lower than proponents of AGI Racing hold. In particular, it is questionable
whether winning the race enables complete domination over losers. Third,
international cooperation and coordination, and perhaps carefully crafted
deterrence measures, constitute viable alternatives to racing to AGI which have
much smaller risks and promise to deliver most of the benefits that racing to
AGI is supposed to provide. Hence, racing to AGI is not in anyone's
self-interest as other actions, particularly incentivizing and seeking
international cooperation around AI issues, are preferable.

### [425] [Real-Time Audio-Visual Speech Enhancement Using Pre-trained Visual Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21448)
*Teng,Ma,Sile Yin,Li-Chia Yang,Shuo Zhang*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种实时音视频语音增强系统RAVEN，通过结合音频和视觉信息，有效隔离并增强目标说话人，同时抑制干扰说话人和背景噪声。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在音频环境中，尤其是在存在干扰说话人的情况下，语音增强仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 研究了从音视频语音识别（AVSR）和主动说话人检测（ASD）中学习的视觉嵌入如何在不同信噪比（SNR）和干扰说话人数量下贡献于AVSE。

Result: 结果表明，在低信噪比、多说话人环境中，结合AVSR和ASD嵌入效果最佳；而在仅噪声场景中，AVSR嵌入表现最好。

Conclusion: 开发了一个实时流式系统，并在CPU上运行，提供了视频演示和代码库，这是首个开源的实时AVSE系统实现。

Abstract: Speech enhancement in audio-only settings remains challenging, particularly
in the presence of interfering speakers. This paper presents a simple yet
effective real-time audio-visual speech enhancement (AVSE) system, RAVEN, which
isolates and enhances the on-screen target speaker while suppressing
interfering speakers and background noise. We investigate how visual embeddings
learned from audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) and active speaker
detection (ASD) contribute to AVSE across different SNR conditions and numbers
of interfering speakers. Our results show concatenating embeddings from AVSR
and ASD models provides the greatest improvement in low-SNR, multi-speaker
environments, while AVSR embeddings alone perform best in noise-only scenarios.
In addition, we develop a real-time streaming system that operates on a
computer CPU and we provide a video demonstration and code repository. To our
knowledge, this is the first open-source implementation of a real-time AVSE
system.

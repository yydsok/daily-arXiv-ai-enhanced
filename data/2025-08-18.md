### [1] [Grounding Rule-Based Argumentation Using Datalog](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10976)
*Martin Diller,Sarah Alice Gaggl,Philipp Hanisch,Giuseppina Monterosso,Fritz Rauschenbach*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ASPIC+框架缺乏支持一阶规则推理的智能基础化方法，本文提出了一种基于Datalog的智能基础化方法，并通过实验验证了其可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ASPIC+方法仅支持命题规则，而一阶规则需要基础化，可能导致输入理论规模指数级增长，缺乏专用解决方案。

Method: 将一阶ASPIC+实例转化为Datalog程序，利用Datalog引擎获取基础化替换，并提出针对ASPIC+的简化方法以减少无关规则的基础化。

Result: 提出了一种智能基础化方法，保持推理正确性的同时控制基础化规模，并通过原型实现验证了其可扩展性。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了ASPIC+中一阶规则推理的基础化问题，为实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: ASPIC+ is one of the main general frameworks for rule-based argumentation for
AI. Although first-order rules are commonly used in ASPIC+ examples, most
existing approaches to reason over rule-based argumentation only support
propositional rules. To enable reasoning over first-order instances, a
preliminary grounding step is required. As groundings can lead to an
exponential increase in the size of the input theories, intelligent procedures
are needed. However, there is a lack of dedicated solutions for ASPIC+.
Therefore, we propose an intelligent grounding procedure that keeps the size of
the grounding manageable while preserving the correctness of the reasoning
process. To this end, we translate the first-order ASPIC+ instance into a
Datalog program and query a Datalog engine to obtain ground substitutions to
perform the grounding of rules and contraries. Additionally, we propose
simplifications specific to the ASPIC+ formalism to avoid grounding of rules
that have no influence on the reasoning process. Finally, we performed an
empirical evaluation of a prototypical implementation to show scalability.

### [2] [From Individual to Multi-Agent Algorithmic Recourse: Minimizing the Welfare Gap via Capacitated Bipartite Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11070)
*Zahra Khotanlou,Kate Larson,Amir-Hossein Karimi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多主体算法追索框架，解决现有研究中单主体和单模型场景的局限性，通过多对多匹配优化社会福利。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中决策涉及多个交互主体，而现有算法追索研究多关注单主体和单模型场景，忽略了多主体竞争资源的复杂性。

Method: 将多对多交互建模为带容量限制的加权二分图匹配问题，提出三层优化框架：基础匹配、容量再分配和成本感知优化。

Result: 实验验证表明，该框架能在系统设置最小修改下实现接近最优的社会福利。

Conclusion: 该研究将算法追索从个体推荐扩展到系统设计，为提升社会福利提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Decision makers are increasingly relying on machine learning in sensitive
situations. In such settings, algorithmic recourse aims to provide individuals
with actionable and minimally costly steps to reverse unfavorable AI-driven
decisions. While existing research predominantly focuses on single-individual
(i.e., seeker) and single-model (i.e., provider) scenarios, real-world
applications often involve multiple interacting stakeholders. Optimizing
outcomes for seekers under an individual welfare approach overlooks the
inherently multi-agent nature of real-world systems, where individuals interact
and compete for limited resources. To address this, we introduce a novel
framework for multi-agent algorithmic recourse that accounts for multiple
recourse seekers and recourse providers. We model this many-to-many interaction
as a capacitated weighted bipartite matching problem, where matches are guided
by both recourse cost and provider capacity. Edge weights, reflecting recourse
costs, are optimized for social welfare while quantifying the welfare gap
between individual welfare and this collectively feasible outcome. We propose a
three-layer optimization framework: (1) basic capacitated matching, (2) optimal
capacity redistribution to minimize the welfare gap, and (3) cost-aware
optimization balancing welfare maximization with capacity adjustment costs.
Experimental validation on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrates that
our framework enables the many-to-many algorithmic recourse to achieve
near-optimal welfare with minimum modification in system settings. This work
extends algorithmic recourse from individual recommendations to system-level
design, providing a tractable path toward higher social welfare while
maintaining individual actionability.

### [3] [Learn to optimize for automatic proton PBS treatment planning for H&N cancers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11085)
*Qingqing Wang,Liqiang Xiao,Chang Chang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于数据驱动的逆优化器和PPO框架的自动治疗计划方法，显著提高了头颈部癌症质子PBS治疗计划的效率和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统质子PBS治疗计划中，逆优化依赖理论驱动方法且耗时，需自动化和高效解决方案。

Method: 结合L2O逆优化器和PPO框架，利用Transformer处理长上下文，预测更新步骤并自动调整目标参数。

Result: 相比L-BFGSB，L2O逆优化器效率提升36.41%，有效性提升22.97%，计划生成时间平均2.55小时。

Conclusion: 该方法在临床可接受时间内生成高质量计划，优于人工计划，适用于多种复杂情况。

Abstract: Proton PBS treatment planning for H&N cancers involves numerous conflicting
objectives, requiring significant effort from human planners to balance and
satisfy multiple clinical goals during planning. To achieve this,
experience-demanding objective parameter adjustment and computationally
expensive inverse optimization are performed iteratively. Extensive efforts
have been made to automatically adjust objective parameters, but the most
time-consuming component, i.e., inverse optimization, still relies heavily on
theory-driven approaches. We propose a data-driven inverse optimizer and
integrate it into a PPO-based automatic treatment planning framework to
automatically generate high-quality plans within a clinical acceptable planning
time. The inverse optimizer is a L2O method that predicts update steps by
learning from the task-specific data distribution. For the first time, we
integrate techniques designed for long-context processing, originally developed
for LLMs, into a Transformer-based L2O framework to address the scalability
issue of existing L2O methods. The PPO framework functions as an outer-loop
virtual planner, autonomously adjusting objective parameters through a policy
network, and the dose predictor is used to initialize objective parameters. The
inner-loop L2O inverse optimizer computes machine-deliverable MU values based
on objectives refined by the PPO policy network. 97 patients are collected in
this study, and compared with L-BFGSB, our L2O-based inverse optimizer improves
the effectiveness and efficiency by 22.97% and 36.41%, respectively. In
conjunction with the PPO-based learned virtual planner, plans generated by our
framework within an average of 2.55 hours show improved or comparable OAR
sparing with superior target coverage for patients with different prescription
dose levels, number of target volumes, beam angles, etc., compared with
human-generated plans.

### [4] [On Strong and Weak Admissibility in Non-Flat Assumption-Based Argumentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11182)
*Matti Berthold,Lydia Blümel,Anna Rapberger*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文扩展了假设基础论证（ABA）中的可接受性概念研究，引入了强和弱可接受性及其对应的语义，并探讨了它们在非平坦ABA中的性质。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究ABA中可接受性概念的替代方案，填补强可接受性在ABA中的研究空白，并扩展弱可接受性到非平坦ABA。

Method: 使用抽象双极集合基础论证框架（BSAFs）作为形式化工具，研究强和弱可接受性及其语义在非平坦ABA中的性质。

Result: 证明了强和弱可接受性在非平坦ABA中保持了模块化性质，但也指出了其与标准可接受性类似的局限性。

Conclusion: 强和弱可接受性在非平坦ABA中具有研究价值，但需进一步解决其局限性。

Abstract: In this work, we broaden the investigation of admissibility notions in the
context of assumption-based argumentation (ABA). More specifically, we study
two prominent alternatives to the standard notion of admissibility from
abstract argumentation, namely strong and weak admissibility, and introduce the
respective preferred, complete and grounded semantics for general (sometimes
called non-flat) ABA. To do so, we use abstract bipolar set-based argumentation
frameworks (BSAFs) as formal playground since they concisely capture the
relations between assumptions and are expressive enough to represent general
non-flat ABA frameworks, as recently shown. While weak admissibility has been
recently investigated for a restricted fragment of ABA in which assumptions
cannot be derived (flat ABA), strong admissibility has not been investigated
for ABA so far. We introduce strong admissibility for ABA and investigate
desirable properties. We furthermore extend the recent investigations of weak
admissibility in the flat ABA fragment to the non-flat case. We show that the
central modularization property is maintained under classical, strong, and weak
admissibility. We also show that strong and weakly admissible semantics in
non-flat ABA share some of the shortcomings of standard admissible semantics
and discuss ways to address these.

### [5] [Beyond Solving Math Quiz: Evaluating the Ability of Large Reasoning Models to Ask for Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11252)
*Youcheng Huang,Bowen Qin,Chen Huang,Duanyu Feng,Xi Yang,Wenqiang Lei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出新数据集评估大型推理模型（LRMs）在解决不完整问题时的能力，发现其无法主动请求信息，并揭示了其过度思考和幻觉行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准仅评估模型在解决明确问题时的能力，而真正的智能代理应能主动请求缺失信息，填补这一研究空白。

Method: 构建包含两类不完整问题的新数据集，并系统性评估LRMs的表现。

Result: LRMs无法主动请求信息，且表现出过度思考和幻觉行为。监督微调在培养此能力方面具有潜力与挑战。

Conclusion: 研究为开发真正智能的LRMs提供了新视角，强调需超越单纯解决问题的能力。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable problem-solving
abilities in mathematics, as evaluated by existing benchmarks exclusively on
well-defined problems. However, such evaluation setup constitutes a critical
gap, since a genuine intelligent agent should not only solve problems (as a
math quiz solver), but also be able~to ask for information when the problems
lack sufficient information, enabling proactivity in responding users'
requests. To bridge such gap, we proposes a new dataset consisting of two types
of incomplete problems with diverse contexts. Based on the dataset, our
systematical evaluation of LRMs reveals their inability in proactively asking
for information. In addition, we uncover the behaviors related to overthinking
and hallucination of LRMs, and highlight the potential and challenges of
supervised fine-tuning in learning such ability. We hope to provide new
insights in developing LRMs with genuine intelligence, rather than just solving
problems.

### [6] [SAGE: Scale-Aware Gradual Evolution for Continual Knowledge Graph Embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11347)
*Yifei Li,Lingling Zhang,Hang Yan,Tianzhe Zhao,Zihan Ma,Muye Huang,Jun Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SAGE提出了一种动态知识图谱嵌入框架，通过自适应维度扩展和动态蒸馏机制，显著提升了动态知识图谱嵌入的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实中的知识图谱是动态演化的，现有方法未能充分考虑更新规模的变化和系统评估。

Method: SAGE根据更新规模确定嵌入维度并扩展嵌入空间，采用动态蒸馏机制平衡新旧知识。

Result: 在七个基准测试中，SAGE显著优于基线方法，MRR、H@1和H@10分别提升1.38%、1.25%和1.6%。

Conclusion: SAGE证明了自适应嵌入维度在动态知识图谱嵌入中的重要性，代码已开源。

Abstract: Traditional knowledge graph (KG) embedding methods aim to represent entities
and relations in a low-dimensional space, primarily focusing on static graphs.
However, real-world KGs are dynamically evolving with the constant addition of
entities, relations and facts. To address such dynamic nature of KGs, several
continual knowledge graph embedding (CKGE) methods have been developed to
efficiently update KG embeddings to accommodate new facts while maintaining
learned knowledge. As KGs grow at different rates and scales in real-world
scenarios, existing CKGE methods often fail to consider the varying scales of
updates and lack systematic evaluation throughout the entire update process. In
this paper, we propose SAGE, a scale-aware gradual evolution framework for
CKGE. Specifically, SAGE firstly determine the embedding dimensions based on
the update scales and expand the embedding space accordingly. The Dynamic
Distillation mechanism is further employed to balance the preservation of
learned knowledge and the incorporation of new facts. We conduct extensive
experiments on seven benchmarks, and the results show that SAGE consistently
outperforms existing baselines, with a notable improvement of 1.38% in MRR,
1.25% in H@1 and 1.6% in H@10. Furthermore, experiments comparing SAGE with
methods using fixed embedding dimensions show that SAGE achieves optimal
performance on every snapshot, demonstrating the importance of adaptive
embedding dimensions in CKGE. The codes of SAGE are publicly available at:

### [7] [CRAFT-GUI: Curriculum-Reinforced Agent For GUI Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11360)
*Songqin Nong,Jingxuan Xu,Sheng Zhou,Jianfeng Chen,Xiaoxuan Tang,Tao Jiang,Wenhao Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出CRAFT-GUI框架，通过课程学习和细粒度奖励设计，解决GUI任务中RL方法的局限性，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RL方法在GUI任务中忽视任务难度差异和奖励信号单一化，导致学习效率低下。

Method: 采用基于GRPO的课程学习框架，结合规则和模型评估设计细粒度奖励函数。

Result: 在公开和内部基准测试中分别提升5.6%和10.3%，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 结合课程学习和RL能显著提升GUI交互任务的性能。

Abstract: As autonomous agents become adept at understanding and interacting with
graphical user interface (GUI) environments, a new era of automated task
execution is emerging. Recent studies have demonstrated that Reinforcement
Learning (RL) can effectively enhance agents' performance in dynamic
interactive GUI environments. However, these methods face two key limitations:
(1) they overlook the significant variation in difficulty across different GUI
tasks by treating the entire training data as a uniform set, which hampers the
agent's ability to adapt its learning process; and (2) most approaches collapse
task-specific nuances into a single, coarse reward, leaving the agent with a
uniform signal that yields inefficient policy updates. To address these
limitations, we propose CRAFT-GUI, a curriculum learning framework based on
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that explicitly accounts for the
varying difficulty across trajectories. To enable more fine-grained policy
optimization, we design a reward function that combines simple rule-based
signals with model-judged evaluation, providing richer and more nuanced
feedback during training. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
achieves significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art approaches,
outperforming them by 5.6% on public benchmarks Android Control and 10.3% on
our internal online benchmarks, respectively. These findings empirically
validate the effectiveness of integrating reinforcement learning with
curriculum learning in GUI interaction tasks.

### [8] [AIM-Bench: Evaluating Decision-making Biases of Agentic LLM as Inventory Manager](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11416)
*Xuhua Zhao,Yuxuan Xie,Caihua Chen,Yuxiang Sun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLM）代理在不确定供应链管理中的库存决策能力及其决策偏见，提出了AIM-Bench基准测试，并探讨了缓解偏见的策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补LLM代理在不确定库存决策中的能力及偏见研究的空白，评估其在现实问题中的有效性。

Method: 通过AIM-Bench基准测试，设计多样化的库存补充实验，分析不同LLM的决策行为及偏见。

Result: 发现LLM代理表现出类似人类的决策偏见，并探索了缓解偏见（如认知反思和信息共享）的策略。

Conclusion: 需谨慎考虑LLM在库存决策中的偏见，为开发以人为本的供应链决策支持系统提供方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in mathematical reasoning and the long-term planning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have precipitated the development
of agents, which are being increasingly leveraged in business operations
processes. Decision models to optimize inventory levels are one of the core
elements of operations management. However, the capabilities of the LLM agent
in making inventory decisions in uncertain contexts, as well as the
decision-making biases (e.g. framing effect, etc.) of the agent, remain largely
unexplored. This prompts concerns regarding the capacity of LLM agents to
effectively address real-world problems, as well as the potential implications
of biases that may be present. To address this gap, we introduce AIM-Bench, a
novel benchmark designed to assess the decision-making behaviour of LLM agents
in uncertain supply chain management scenarios through a diverse series of
inventory replenishment experiments. Our results reveal that different LLMs
typically exhibit varying degrees of decision bias that are similar to those
observed in human beings. In addition, we explored strategies to mitigate the
pull-to-centre effect and the bullwhip effect, namely cognitive reflection and
implementation of information sharing. These findings underscore the need for
careful consideration of the potential biases in deploying LLMs in Inventory
decision-making scenarios. We hope that these insights will pave the way for
mitigating human decision bias and developing human-centred decision support
systems for supply chains.

*Kangyu Wang,Hongliang He,Lin Liu,Ruiqi Liang,Zhenzhong Lan,Jianguo Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Inclusion Arena是一个实时排行榜，通过从AI应用中收集的人类反馈对模型进行排名，弥补了静态数据集和通用领域提示的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准和排行榜依赖静态数据集或通用领域提示，无法反映模型在真实应用中的表现。

Method: 平台整合了成对模型比较，使用Bradley-Terry模型，并引入Placement Matches和Proximity Sampling两项创新。

Result: Inclusion Arena提供可靠稳定的排名，数据传递性优于通用众包数据集，并能有效减少恶意操纵风险。

Conclusion: 该平台通过连接基础模型和实际应用，加速开发更实用的LLMs和MLLMs。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
have ushered in a new era of AI capabilities, demonstrating near-human-level
performance across diverse scenarios. While numerous benchmarks (e.g., MMLU)
and leaderboards (e.g., Chatbot Arena) have been proposed to help evolve the
development of LLMs and MLLMs, most rely on static datasets or crowdsourced
general-domain prompts, often falling short of reflecting performance in
real-world applications. To bridge this critical gap, we present Inclusion
Arena, a live leaderboard that ranks models based on human feedback collected
directly from AI-powered applications. Our platform integrates pairwise model
comparisons into natural user interactions, ensuring evaluations reflect
practical usage scenarios. For robust model ranking, we employ the
Bradley-Terry model augmented with two key innovations: (1) Placement Matches,
a cold-start mechanism to quickly estimate initial ratings for newly integrated
models, and (2) Proximity Sampling, an intelligent comparison strategy that
prioritizes battles between models of similar capabilities to maximize
information gain and enhance rating stability. Extensive empirical analyses and
simulations demonstrate that Inclusion Arena yields reliable and stable
rankings, exhibits higher data transitivity compared to general crowdsourced
datasets, and significantly mitigates the risk of malicious manipulation. By
fostering an open alliance between foundation models and real-world
applications, Inclusion Arena aims to accelerate the development of LLMs and
MLLMs truly optimized for practical, user-centric deployments. The platform is
publicly accessible at https://doraemon.alipay.com/model-ranking.

*David H. Chan,Mark Roberts,Dana S. Nau*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种概率性地标的概念，并将其应用于UCT算法以分解MDP问题，结果表明地标能显著提升在线概率规划的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地标在经典规划中已有重要应用，但在随机领域很少使用，研究旨在探索其在概率规划中的潜力。

Method: 通过形式化概率地标，并调整UCT算法以利用地标作为子目标来分解MDP，核心在于平衡贪心地标达成与最终目标达成。

Result: 在基准测试中，合适的地标能显著提升UCT算法的性能，但贪心与长期目标的平衡因问题而异。

Conclusion: 地标可以为解决MDP的随时算法提供有效指导。

Abstract: Landmarks$\unicode{x2013}$conditions that must be satisfied at some point in
every solution plan$\unicode{x2013}$have contributed to major advancements in
classical planning, but they have seldom been used in stochastic domains. We
formalize probabilistic landmarks and adapt the UCT algorithm to leverage them
as subgoals to decompose MDPs; core to the adaptation is balancing between
greedy landmark achievement and final goal achievement. Our results in
benchmark domains show that well-chosen landmarks can significantly improve the
performance of UCT in online probabilistic planning, while the best balance of
greedy versus long-term goal achievement is problem-dependent. The results
suggest that landmarks can provide helpful guidance for anytime algorithms
solving MDPs.

Motivation: 解决大规模规划问题中的状态空间爆炸问题，并探索如何结合LLM与领域知识以生成有效计划。

Method: 提出LLM辅助规划器，先分解问题为子任务，再通过LLM4Inspire（通用知识启发）和LLM4Predict（领域知识预测）辅助分解。

Result: 实验验证了规划器的有效性，LLM4Predict在搜索空间剪枝中表现优于LLM4Inspire。

Conclusion: 结合领域知识的LLM（如LLM4Predict）在大规模规划问题中更具潜力。

Abstract: Addressing large-scale planning problems has become one of the central
challenges in the planning community, deriving from the state-space explosion
caused by growing objects and actions. Recently, researchers have explored the
effectiveness of leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate helpful
actions and states to prune the search space. However, prior works have largely
overlooked integrating LLMs with domain-specific knowledge to ensure valid
plans. In this paper, we propose a novel LLM-assisted planner integrated with
problem decomposition, which first decomposes large planning problems into
multiple simpler sub-tasks. Then we explore two novel paradigms to utilize
LLMs, i.e., LLM4Inspire and LLM4Predict, to assist problem decomposition, where
LLM4Inspire provides heuristic guidance according to general knowledge and
LLM4Predict employs domain-specific knowledge to infer intermediate conditions.
We empirically validate the effectiveness of our planner across multiple
domains, demonstrating the ability of search space partition when solving
large-scale planning problems. The experimental results show that LLMs
effectively locate feasible solutions when pruning the search space, where
infusing domain-specific knowledge into LLMs, i.e., LLM4Predict, holds
particular promise compared with LLM4Inspire, which offers general knowledge
within LLMs.

TL;DR: A2HCoder是一个基于大语言模型的算法到硬件描述语言（HDL）的转换工具，通过分层框架提高代码生成的鲁棒性和可解释性，减少幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无线通信系统对超低延迟和功耗的需求增加，但算法设计与硬件实现之间存在显著差距，传统方法需要大量专业知识和时间。

Method: A2HCoder采用分层框架，水平方向将复杂算法分解为模块化功能块，垂直方向通过逐步细粒度翻译结合外部工具链（如MATLAB和Vitis HLS）确保硬件正确性。

Result: 在5G无线通信领域的实际部署案例中验证了A2HCoder的实用性、可靠性和部署效率。

Conclusion: A2HCoder通过分层框架和逐步翻译，有效解决了算法到硬件实现的转换问题，减少了幻觉问题并提高了效率。

Abstract: In wireless communication systems, stringent requirements such as ultra-low
latency and power consumption have significantly increased the demand for
efficient algorithm-to-hardware deployment. However, a persistent and
substantial gap remains between algorithm design and hardware implementation.
Bridging this gap traditionally requires extensive domain expertise and
time-consuming manual development, due to fundamental mismatches between
high-level programming languages like MATLAB and hardware description languages
(HDLs) such as Verilog-in terms of memory access patterns, data processing
manners, and datatype representations. To address this challenge, we propose
A2HCoder: a Hierarchical Algorithm-to-HDL Coding Agent, powered by large
language models (LLMs), designed to enable agile and reliable
algorithm-to-hardware translation. A2HCoder introduces a hierarchical framework
that enhances both robustness and interpretability while suppressing common
hallucination issues in LLM-generated code. In the horizontal dimension,
A2HCoder decomposes complex algorithms into modular functional blocks,
simplifying code generation and improving consistency. In the vertical
dimension, instead of relying on end-to-end generation, A2HCoder performs
step-by-step, fine-grained translation, leveraging external toolchains such as
MATLAB and Vitis HLS for debugging and circuit-level synthesis. This structured
process significantly mitigates hallucinations and ensures hardware-level
correctness. We validate A2HCoder through a real-world deployment case in the
5G wireless communication domain, demonstrating its practicality, reliability,
and deployment efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型在捕捉用户多维度和个体差异方面表现不足，需要更精准的用户模拟方法。

Method: 提出PersonaTwin框架，结合多源数据，并通过医疗健康领域的8,500个个体数据集进行系统评估。

Result: 实验显示PersonaTwin在仿真保真度和公平性上表现优异，下游模型训练效果接近真实个体数据。

Conclusion: PersonaTwin为个性化数字用户建模和行为分析提供了高效工具，展示了LLM数字孪生方法的潜力。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) afford new possibilities for user modeling
and approximation of human behaviors, they often fail to capture the
multidimensional nuances of individual users. In this work, we introduce
PersonaTwin, a multi-tier prompt conditioning framework that builds adaptive
digital twins by integrating demographic, behavioral, and psychometric data.
Using a comprehensive data set in the healthcare context of more than 8,500
individuals, we systematically benchmark PersonaTwin against standard LLM
outputs, and our rigorous evaluation unites state-of-the-art text similarity
metrics with dedicated demographic parity assessments, ensuring that generated
responses remain accurate and unbiased. Experimental results show that our
framework produces simulation fidelity on par with oracle settings. Moreover,
downstream models trained on persona-twins approximate models trained on
individuals in terms of prediction and fairness metrics across both
GPT-4o-based and Llama-based models. Together, these findings underscore the
potential for LLM digital twin-based approaches in producing realistic and
emotionally nuanced user simulations, offering a powerful tool for personalized
digital user modeling and behavior analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别公司风险对投资者和金融市场的健康至关重要，但现有方法可能效率不足。

Method: 提出包含七个方面的风险分类模式，标注744篇新闻文章，并测试多种机器学习模型，包括零样本和少样本提示的LLMs以及微调预训练模型。

Result: 实验显示，零样本和少样本提示的LLMs表现一般，而微调预训练模型在多数风险因素上表现更好。

Conclusion: 从新闻中识别风险因素能为公司和行业运营提供深入见解。

Abstract: Identifying risks associated with a company is important to investors and the
well-being of the overall financial market. In this study, we build a
computational framework to automatically extract company risk factors from news
articles. Our newly proposed schema comprises seven distinct aspects, such as
supply chain, regulations, and competitions. We sample and annotate 744 news
articles and benchmark various machine learning models. While large language
models have achieved huge progress in various types of NLP tasks, our
experiment shows that zero-shot and few-shot prompting state-of-the-art LLMs
(e.g. LLaMA-2) can only achieve moderate to low performances in identifying
risk factors. And fine-tuned pre-trained language models are performing better
on most of the risk factors. Using this model, we analyze over 277K Bloomberg
news articles and demonstrate that identifying risk factors from news could
provide extensive insight into the operations of companies and industries.

TL;DR: Rule2Text框架利用LLMs为知识图谱的逻辑规则生成自然语言解释，提升可解释性和可用性。通过实验验证，结合人类评估和LLM-as-a-judge框架，优化了模型性能，并在特定领域数据上表现突出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识图谱的逻辑规则因复杂性和标签习惯难以理解，Rule2Text旨在通过自然语言解释提升其可访问性。

Method: 利用多种LLMs（如Gemini 2.0 Flash）和提示策略（如零样本、链式推理），结合人类评估和LLM-as-a-judge框架优化模型，并微调开源Zephyr模型。

Result: 微调后解释质量显著提升，尤其在领域特定数据集上表现优异。LLM-as-a-judge框架与人类评估一致性高。

Conclusion: Rule2Text有效提升知识图谱规则的可解释性，支持无显式类型信息的图谱，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) can be enhanced through rule mining; however, the
resulting logical rules are often difficult for humans to interpret due to
their inherent complexity and the idiosyncratic labeling conventions of
individual KGs. This work presents Rule2Text, a comprehensive framework that
leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate natural language
explanations for mined logical rules, thereby improving KG accessibility and
usability. We conduct extensive experiments using multiple datasets, including
Freebase variants (FB-CVT-REV, FB+CVT-REV, and FB15k-237) as well as the
ogbl-biokg dataset, with rules mined using AMIE 3.5.1. We systematically
evaluate several LLMs across a comprehensive range of prompting strategies,
including zero-shot, few-shot, variable type incorporation, and
Chain-of-Thought reasoning. To systematically assess models' performance, we
conduct a human evaluation of generated explanations on correctness and
clarity. To address evaluation scalability, we develop and validate an
LLM-as-a-judge framework that demonstrates strong agreement with human
evaluators. Leveraging the best-performing model (Gemini 2.0 Flash), LLM judge,
and human-in-the-loop feedback, we construct high-quality ground truth
datasets, which we use to fine-tune the open-source Zephyr model. Our results
demonstrate significant improvements in explanation quality after fine-tuning,
with particularly strong gains in the domain-specific dataset. Additionally, we
integrate a type inference module to support KGs lacking explicit type
information. All code and data are publicly available at

*Tejomay Kishor Padole,Suyash P Awate,Pushpak Bhattacharyya*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于验证器的推理时间扩展方法，用于提升掩码扩散语言模型（MDM）在去噪过程中的生成质量，实验证明MDM在文本风格转换任务中优于自回归语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 掩码扩散语言模型（MDM）因其可扩展性和易训练性成为离散数据生成的前沿方法，但如何进一步提升其生成质量仍需探索。

Method: 提出了一种基于验证器的推理时间扩展方法，结合预训练嵌入模型，优化MDM的去噪过程。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了生成质量，并在文本风格转换任务中优于自回归语言模型。

Conclusion: MDM结合验证器是一种高效的生成框架，尤其在非自回归生成任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDMs) have recently gained traction as a
viable generative framework for natural language. This can be attributed to its
scalability and ease of training compared to other diffusion model paradigms
for discrete data, establishing itself as the state-of-the-art
non-autoregressive generator for discrete data. Diffusion models, in general,
have shown excellent ability to improve the generation quality by leveraging
inference-time scaling either by increasing the number of denoising steps or by
using external verifiers on top of the outputs of each step to guide the
generation. In this work, we propose a verifier-based inference-time scaling
method that aids in finding a better candidate generation during the denoising
process of the MDM. Our experiments demonstrate the application of MDMs for
standard text-style transfer tasks and establish MDMs as a better alternative
to autoregressive language models. Additionally, we show that a simple
soft-value-based verifier setup for MDMs using off-the-shelf pre-trained
embedding models leads to significant gains in generation quality even when
used on top of typical classifier-free guidance setups in the existing
literature.

Motivation: 现有LLM安全框架忽视未成年人的发展脆弱性，需重新评估。

Method: 引入SproutBench，包含1,283个基于发展的对抗性提示，评估47种LLM。

Result: 发现显著安全漏洞，如情感依赖和隐私风险，并揭示交互性与年龄适宜性的负相关。

Conclusion: 提出儿童中心AI设计与部署的实用指南。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of large language models (LLMs) in applications
targeting children and adolescents necessitates a fundamental reassessment of
prevailing AI safety frameworks, which are largely tailored to adult users and
neglect the distinct developmental vulnerabilities of minors. This paper
highlights key deficiencies in existing LLM safety benchmarks, including their
inadequate coverage of age-specific cognitive, emotional, and social risks
spanning early childhood (ages 0--6), middle childhood (7--12), and adolescence
(13--18). To bridge these gaps, we introduce SproutBench, an innovative
evaluation suite comprising 1,283 developmentally grounded adversarial prompts
designed to probe risks such as emotional dependency, privacy violations, and
imitation of hazardous behaviors. Through rigorous empirical evaluation of 47
diverse LLMs, we uncover substantial safety vulnerabilities, corroborated by
robust inter-dimensional correlations (e.g., between Safety and Risk
Prevention) and a notable inverse relationship between Interactivity and Age
Appropriateness. These insights yield practical guidelines for advancing
child-centric AI design and deployment.

Conclusion: 通过数据分布和分词调控可改善跨语言传递，为LLM预训练提供新方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) struggle with cross-lingual knowledge transfer:
they hallucinate when asked in one language about facts expressed in a
different language during training. This work introduces a controlled setting
to study the causes and dynamics of this phenomenon by training small
Transformer models from scratch on synthetic multilingual datasets. We identify
a learning phase wherein a model develops either separate or unified
representations of the same facts across languages, and show that unification
is essential for cross-lingual transfer. We also show that the degree of
unification depends on mutual information between facts and training data
language, and on how easy it is to extract that language. Based on these
insights, we develop methods to modulate the level of cross-lingual transfer by
manipulating data distribution and tokenization, and we introduce metrics and
visualizations to formally characterize their effects on unification. Our work
shows how controlled settings can shed light on pre-training dynamics and
suggests new directions for improving cross-lingual transfer in LLMs.

TL;DR: 研究语言模型代理在复杂任务中应对计划失败的能力，发现其难以适应环境反馈并制定备用计划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索语言模型代理在面临外部失败时如何搜索替代方案以实现目标。

Method: 设计了一个专门的规划基准测试，通过函数调用组合解决问题，并引入外部失败（如函数不可用）。

Result: 语言模型代理难以适应环境反馈，无法有效制定备用计划，即使搜索空间受限。

Conclusion: 当前生成模型在应对环境反馈方面存在挑战，需进一步研究改进。

Abstract: As language model agents are applied to real world problems of increasing
complexity, they will be expected to formulate plans across large search
spaces. If those plans fail for reasons beyond their control, how well do
language agents search for alternative ways to achieve their goals? We devise a
specialized agentic planning benchmark to study this question. Each planning
problem is solved via combinations of function calls. The agent searches for
relevant functions from a set of over four thousand possibilities, and observes
environmental feedback in the form of function outputs or error messages. Our
benchmark confronts the agent with external failures in its workflow, such as
functions that suddenly become unavailable. At the same time, even with the
introduction of these failures, we guarantee that the task remains solvable.
Ideally, an agent's performance on the planning task should not be affected by
the presence of external failures. Overall, we find that language agents
struggle to formulate and execute backup plans in response to environment
feedback. While state-of-the-art models are often able to identify the correct
function to use in the right context, they struggle to adapt to feedback from
the environment and often fail to pursue alternate courses of action, even when
the search space is artificially restricted. We provide a systematic analysis
of the failures of both open-source and commercial models, examining the
effects of search space size, as well as the benefits of scaling model size in
our setting. Our analysis identifies key challenges for current generative
models as well as promising directions for future work.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种可重用、细粒度且主题无关的框架，用于评估大语言模型（LLMs）中与极化相关的偏见，并通过俄罗斯-乌克兰战争的案例研究验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管在偏见检测和缓解技术上取得了进展，但某些挑战仍未得到充分探索，尤其是在敏感话题上的极化偏见。

Method: 结合极化敏感的情感指标与合成的平衡数据集，使用预定义的语义类别进行评估。

Result: 研究发现LLMs普遍对乌克兰表现出更积极的情感，但在不同语义类别中存在显著差异，且模型对提示修改表现出偏见。

Conclusion: 该框架支持自动化数据集生成和细粒度偏见评估，适用于多种极化驱动场景，并与其他偏见评估策略互补。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to exhibit biases in downstream tasks,
especially when dealing with sensitive topics such as political discourse,
gender identity, ethnic relations, or national stereotypes. Although
significant progress has been made in bias detection and mitigation techniques,
certain challenges remain underexplored. This study proposes a reusable,
granular, and topic-agnostic framework to evaluate polarisation-related biases
in LLM (both open-source and closed-source). Our approach combines
polarisation-sensitive sentiment metrics with a synthetically generated
balanced dataset of conflict-related statements, using a predefined set of
semantic categories.
  As a case study, we created a synthetic dataset that focusses on the
Russia-Ukraine war, and we evaluated the bias in several LLMs: Llama-3,
Mistral, GPT-4, Claude 3.5, and Gemini 1.0. Beyond aggregate bias scores, with
a general trend for more positive sentiment toward Ukraine, the framework
allowed fine-grained analysis with considerable variation between semantic
categories, uncovering divergent behavioural patterns among models. Adaptation
to prompt modifications showed further bias towards preconceived language and
citizenship modification.
  Overall, the framework supports automated dataset generation and fine-grained
bias assessment, is applicable to a variety of polarisation-driven scenarios
and topics, and is orthogonal to many other bias-evaluation strategies.

Motivation: 当前多语言语音翻译模型参数量大，难以在本地部署中平衡推理效率和性能。

Method: 基于Whisper Medium模型，改进为whisperM2M，并集成KVSPN模块，结合推测采样、模型压缩和知识蒸馏技术。

Result: 在六种流行语言上实现SOTA性能，推理速度提升40%（无BLEU损失），结合蒸馏方法后速度提升2.6倍。

Conclusion: 该方法在提升推理效率的同时保持了性能，适用于本地部署场景。

Abstract: Recent advancements in speech-to-text translation have led to the development
of multilingual models capable of handling multiple language pairs
simultaneously. However, these unified models often suffer from large parameter
sizes, making it challenging to balance inference efficiency and performance,
particularly in local deployment scenarios. We propose an innovative Parasitic
Dual-Scale Approach, which combines an enhanced speculative sampling method
with model compression and knowledge distillation techniques. Building on the
Whisper Medium model, we enhance it for multilingual speech translation into
whisperM2M, and integrate our novel KVSPN module, achieving state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance across six popular languages with improved inference
efficiency. KVSPN enables a 40\% speedup with no BLEU score degradation.
Combined with distillation methods, it represents a 2.6$\times$ speedup over
the original Whisper Medium with superior performance.

we describe how real digital dictionaries can be embedded into AMR directed

Then, we reduce those graphs in a confluent manner, i.e. with transformations

Conclusion: RAMP框架为动态行业环境中部署可靠的LLM系统提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) enabled the development of AI
agents that can plan and interact with tools to complete complex tasks.
However, literature on their reliability in real-world applications remains
limited. In this paper, we introduce a multi-agent framework for a marketing
task: audience curation. To solve this, we introduce a framework called RAMP
that iteratively plans, calls tools, verifies the output, and generates
suggestions to improve the quality of the audience generated. Additionally, we
equip the model with a long-term memory store, which is a knowledge base of
client-specific facts and past queries. Overall, we demonstrate the use of LLM
planning and memory, which increases accuracy by 28 percentage points on a set
of 88 evaluation queries. Moreover, we show the impact of iterative
verification and reflection on more ambiguous queries, showing progressively
better recall (roughly +20 percentage points) with more verify/reflect
iterations on a smaller challenge set, and higher user satisfaction. Our
results provide practical insights for deploying reliable LLM-based systems in
dynamic, industry-facing environments.

Motivation: 开发更接近人类听觉处理的模型，以高效处理多种语音任务。

Method: 第一阶段将原始音频转换为基于人类耳蜗的时频表示，提取离散的耳蜗标记；第二阶段对耳蜗标记应用自回归序列模型。

Result: AuriStream在SUPERB语音任务中表现优异，能生成可解码的音频延续。

Conclusion: AuriStream为语音表示学习提供了一个高效的两阶段框架，推动了更接近人类听觉的模型发展。

Abstract: We introduce AuriStream, a biologically inspired model for encoding speech
via a two-stage framework inspired by the human auditory processing hierarchy.
The first stage transforms raw audio into a time-frequency representation based
on the human cochlea, from which we extract discrete \textbf{cochlear tokens}.
The second stage applies an autoregressive sequence model over the cochlear
tokens. AuriStream learns meaningful phoneme and word representations, and
state-of-the-art lexical semantics. AuriStream shows competitive performance on
diverse downstream SUPERB speech tasks. Complementing AuriStream's strong
representational capabilities, it generates continuations of audio which can be
visualized in a spectrogram space and decoded back into audio, providing
insights into the model's predictions. In summary, we present a two-stage
framework for speech representation learning to advance the development of more
human-like models that efficiently handle a range of speech-based tasks.

Result: 前沿LLM在MoNaCo上的F1得分最高仅61.2%，存在召回率低和幻觉问题。

Conclusion: MoNaCo为评估和改进LLM处理复杂问题的能力提供了有效资源。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a go-to tool for querying
information. However, current LLM benchmarks rarely feature natural questions
that are both information-seeking as well as genuinely time-consuming for
humans. To address this gap we introduce MoNaCo, a benchmark of 1,315 natural
and complex questions that require dozens, and at times hundreds, of
intermediate steps to solve -- far more than any existing QA benchmark. To
build MoNaCo, we developed a decomposed annotation pipeline to elicit and
manually answer natural time-consuming questions at scale. Frontier LLMs
evaluated on MoNaCo achieve at most 61.2% F1, hampered by low recall and
hallucinations. Our results underscore the need for reasoning models that
better handle the complexity and sheer breadth of real-world
information-seeking questions -- with MoNaCo providing an effective resource
for tracking such progress. The MONACO benchmark, codebase, prompts and models

Method: MobQA通过自然语言问答评估LLMs，包含事实检索、多选推理和自由形式解释三类问题，需时空和语义推理。

Result: 评估显示LLMs在事实检索上表现强，但在语义推理和解释问题上表现有限，轨迹长度显著影响模型效果。

Conclusion: MobQA揭示了当前LLMs在语义移动理解上的成就与局限，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: This paper presents MobQA, a benchmark dataset designed to evaluate the
semantic understanding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for human
mobility data through natural language question answering.
  While existing models excel at predicting human movement patterns, it remains
unobvious how much they can interpret the underlying reasons or semantic
meaning of those patterns. MobQA provides a comprehensive evaluation framework
for LLMs to answer questions about diverse human GPS trajectories spanning
daily to weekly granularities. It comprises 5,800 high-quality question-answer
pairs across three complementary question types: factual retrieval (precise
data extraction), multiple-choice reasoning (semantic inference), and free-form
explanation (interpretive description), which all require spatial, temporal,
and semantic reasoning. Our evaluation of major LLMs reveals strong performance
on factual retrieval but significant limitations in semantic reasoning and
explanation question answering, with trajectory length substantially impacting
model effectiveness. These findings demonstrate the achievements and
limitations of state-of-the-art LLMs for semantic mobility
understanding.\footnote{MobQA dataset is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tulu作为一种低资源语言，缺乏计算资源支持，但其数字内容增长迅速，因此需要开发冒犯性语言识别工具。

Method: 研究收集了3,845条YouTube评论，标注为四类冒犯性语言，并测试了包括GRU、LSTM、BiGRU、BiLSTM、CNN、注意力机制及Transformer模型在内的多种深度学习模型。

Result: BiGRU模型表现最佳，准确率达82%，宏F1分数为0.81；Transformer模型表现不佳，突显了多语言预训练在低资源混合语言中的局限性。

Conclusion: 该研究为Tulu及其他类似低资源混合语言的NLP研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Tulu, a low-resource Dravidian language predominantly spoken in southern
India, has limited computational resources despite its growing digital
presence. This study presents the first benchmark dataset for Offensive
Language Identification (OLI) in code-mixed Tulu social media content,
collected from YouTube comments across various domains. The dataset, annotated
with high inter-annotator agreement (Krippendorff's alpha = 0.984), includes
3,845 comments categorized into four classes: Not Offensive, Not Tulu,
Offensive Untargeted, and Offensive Targeted. We evaluate a suite of deep
learning models, including GRU, LSTM, BiGRU, BiLSTM, CNN, and attention-based
variants, alongside transformer architectures (mBERT, XLM-RoBERTa). The BiGRU
model with self-attention achieves the best performance with 82% accuracy and a

Conclusion: 该方法在个性化干扰项生成任务中表现出色，兼具鲁棒性和适应性。

Abstract: Distractors, incorrect but plausible answer choices in multiple-choice
questions (MCQs), play a critical role in educational assessment by diagnosing
student misconceptions. Recent work has leveraged large language models (LLMs)
to generate shared, group-level distractors by learning common error patterns
across large student populations. However, such distractors often fail to
capture the diverse reasoning errors of individual students, limiting their
diagnostic effectiveness. To address this limitation, we introduce the task of
personalized distractor generation, which aims to generate tailored distractors
based on individual misconceptions inferred from each student's past
question-answering (QA) records, ensuring every student receives options that
effectively exposes their specific reasoning errors. While promising, this task
is challenging because each student typically has only a few QA records, which
often lack the student's underlying reasoning processes, making training-based
group-level approaches infeasible. To overcome this, we propose a training-free
two-stage framework. In the first stage, we construct a student-specific
misconception prototype by applying Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to recover
the student's reasoning trajectories from past incorrect answers. In the second
stage, this prototype guides the simulation of the student's reasoning on new
questions, enabling the generation of personalized distractors that align with
the student's recurring misconceptions. Experiments show that our approach
achieves the best performance in generating plausible, personalized distractors
for 140 students, and also effectively generalizes to group-level settings,
highlighting its robustness and adaptability.

TL;DR: E-CaTCH是一个可解释且可扩展的框架，用于检测社交媒体上的多模态虚假信息，通过聚类、多模态特征提取和时间建模实现高效分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体上的多模态虚假信息检测面临模态不一致、时间模式变化和类别不平衡等挑战，现有方法未能捕捉事件级结构。

Method: E-CaTCH通过文本相似性和时间接近性聚类帖子为伪事件，提取BERT和ResNet特征，使用自注意力和跨模态注意力对齐特征，并通过LSTM建模时间演化。

Result: 在Fakeddit、IND和COVID-19 MISINFOGRAPH数据集上，E-CaTCH优于现有基线，并展现出跨数据集的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: E-CaTCH通过事件级分类和多模态时间建模，有效解决了虚假信息检测的挑战，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Detecting multimodal misinformation on social media remains challenging due
to inconsistencies between modalities, changes in temporal patterns, and
substantial class imbalance. Many existing methods treat posts independently
and fail to capture the event-level structure that connects them across time
and modality. We propose E-CaTCH, an interpretable and scalable framework for
robustly detecting misinformation. If needed, E-CaTCH clusters posts into
pseudo-events based on textual similarity and temporal proximity, then
processes each event independently. Within each event, textual and visual
features are extracted using pre-trained BERT and ResNet encoders, refined via
intra-modal self-attention, and aligned through bidirectional cross-modal
attention. A soft gating mechanism fuses these representations to form
contextualized, content-aware embeddings of each post. To model temporal
evolution, E-CaTCH segments events into overlapping time windows and uses a
trend-aware LSTM, enhanced with semantic shift and momentum signals, to encode
narrative progression over time. Classification is performed at the event
level, enabling better alignment with real-world misinformation dynamics. To
address class imbalance and promote stable learning, the model integrates
adaptive class weighting, temporal consistency regularization, and hard-example
mining. The total loss is aggregated across all events. Extensive experiments
on Fakeddit, IND, and COVID-19 MISINFOGRAPH demonstrate that E-CaTCH
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Cross-dataset evaluations
further demonstrate its robustness, generalizability, and practical
applicability across diverse misinformation scenarios.

TL;DR: HGRAG方法通过超图整合结构和语义信息，提升多跳问答性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG方法忽略知识的结构关联，而GraphRAG方法过度依赖结构信息，导致文本语义利用不足。

Method: 构建实体超图，结合细粒度实体和粗粒度段落信息，设计超图检索方法，并通过检索增强模块优化结果。

Result: 在基准数据集上表现优于现有方法，检索效率提升6倍。

Conclusion: HGRAG通过跨粒度整合结构和语义信息，显著提升多跳问答效果。

Abstract: Multi-hop question answering (MHQA) requires integrating knowledge scattered
across multiple passages to derive the correct answer. Traditional
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods primarily focus on coarse-grained
textual semantic similarity and ignore structural associations among dispersed
knowledge, which limits their effectiveness in MHQA tasks. GraphRAG methods
address this by leveraging knowledge graphs (KGs) to capture structural
associations, but they tend to overly rely on structural information and
fine-grained word- or phrase-level retrieval, resulting in an underutilization
of textual semantics. In this paper, we propose a novel RAG approach called
HGRAG for MHQA that achieves cross-granularity integration of structural and
semantic information via hypergraphs. Structurally, we construct an entity
hypergraph where fine-grained entities serve as nodes and coarse-grained
passages as hyperedges, and establish knowledge association through shared
entities. Semantically, we design a hypergraph retrieval method that integrates
fine-grained entity similarity and coarse-grained passage similarity via
hypergraph diffusion. Finally, we employ a retrieval enhancement module, which
further refines the retrieved results both semantically and structurally, to
obtain the most relevant passages as context for answer generation with the
LLM. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in QA performance, and achieves a
6$\times$ speedup in retrieval efficiency.

Result: LLMs在形态复杂度高的谜题中表现差，但在与英语相似的特征上表现较好；词素分割预处理有效。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs在语言学推理和低资源语言建模中的挑战，需改进分词方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in reasoning tasks,
but their performance on linguistics puzzles remains consistently poor. These
puzzles, often derived from Linguistics Olympiad (LO) contests, provide a
minimal contamination environment to assess LLMs' linguistic reasoning
abilities across low-resource languages. This work analyses LLMs' performance
on 629 problems across 41 low-resource languages by labelling each with
linguistically informed features to unveil weaknesses. Our analyses show that
LLMs struggle with puzzles involving higher morphological complexity and
perform better on puzzles involving linguistic features that are also found in
English. We also show that splitting words into morphemes as a pre-processing
step improves solvability, indicating a need for more informed and
language-specific tokenisers. These findings thus offer insights into some
challenges in linguistic reasoning and modelling of low-resource languages.

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) in specific domain like tourism
remains challenging due to the prohibitive cost of annotated benchmarks and
persistent issues like hallucinations. We propose $\textbf{L}$able-Free
$\textbf{E}$valuation of LLM on $\textbf{T}$ourism using Expert
$\textbf{T}$ree-$\textbf{o}$f-$\textbf{T}$hought (LETToT), a framework that
leverages expert-derived reasoning structures-instead of labeled data-to access
LLMs in tourism. First, we iteratively refine and validate hierarchical ToT
components through alignment with generic quality dimensions and expert
feedback. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of our systematically optimized
expert ToT with 4.99-14.15\% relative quality gains over baselines. Second, we
apply LETToT's optimized expert ToT to evaluate models of varying scales
(32B-671B parameters), revealing: (1) Scaling laws persist in specialized
domains (DeepSeek-V3 leads), yet reasoning-enhanced smaller models (e.g.,
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B) close this gap; (2) For sub-72B models, explicit
reasoning architectures outperform counterparts in accuracy and conciseness
($p<0.05$). Our work established a scalable, label-free paradigm for
domain-specific LLM evaluation, offering a robust alternative to conventional
annotated benchmarks.

Abstract: Detecting toxic content using language models is crucial yet challenging.
While substantial progress has been made in English, toxicity detection in
French remains underdeveloped, primarily due to the lack of culturally
relevant, large-scale datasets. In this work, we introduce TOXIFRENCH, a new
public benchmark of 53,622 French online comments, constructed via a
semi-automated annotation pipeline that reduces manual labeling to only 10%
through high-confidence LLM-based pre-annotation and human verification. Then,
we benchmark a broad range of models and uncover a counterintuitive insight:
Small Language Models (SLMs) outperform many larger models in robustness and
generalization under the toxicity detection task. Motivated by this finding, we
propose a novel Chain-of-Thought (CoT) fine-tuning strategy using a dynamic
weighted loss that progressively emphasizes the model's final decision,
significantly improving faithfulness. Our fine-tuned 4B model achieves
state-of-the-art performance, improving its F1 score by 13% over its baseline
and outperforming LLMs such as GPT-40 and Gemini-2.5. Further evaluation on a
cross-lingual toxicity benchmark demonstrates strong multilingual ability,
suggesting that our methodology can be effectively extended to other languages
and safety-critical classification tasks.

Motivation: 探讨LLMs在心理健康信息提供中的情感表达差异，以评估其对用户体验的潜在影响。

Method: 对8种LLMs生成的2,880个回答进行情感和情绪评分，分析模型、心理健康问题和用户特征的影响。

Result: 模型选择显著影响情感表达，Mixtral负面情绪最多，Llama最乐观。抑郁问题引发高悲伤，焦虑引发高恐惧，压力问题最乐观。人口统计特征影响较小。

Conclusion: LLMs在心理健康应用中需谨慎选择，因其情感表达差异可能显著影响用户体验。

Abstract: Depression, anxiety, and stress are widespread mental health concerns that
increasingly drive individuals to seek information from Large Language Models
(LLMs). This study investigates how eight LLMs (Claude Sonnet, Copilot, Gemini
Pro, GPT-4o, GPT-4o mini, Llama, Mixtral, and Perplexity) reply to twenty
pragmatic questions about depression, anxiety, and stress when those questions
are framed for six user profiles (baseline, woman, man, young, old, and
university student). The models generated 2,880 answers, which we scored for
sentiment and emotions using state-of-the-art tools. Our analysis revealed that
optimism, fear, and sadness dominated the emotional landscape across all
outputs, with neutral sentiment maintaining consistently high values.
Gratitude, joy, and trust appeared at moderate levels, while emotions such as
anger, disgust, and love were rarely expressed. The choice of LLM significantly
influenced emotional expression patterns. Mixtral exhibited the highest levels
of negative emotions including disapproval, annoyance, and sadness, while Llama
demonstrated the most optimistic and joyful responses. The type of mental
health condition dramatically shaped emotional responses: anxiety prompts
elicited extraordinarily high fear scores (0.974), depression prompts generated
elevated sadness (0.686) and the highest negative sentiment, while
stress-related queries produced the most optimistic responses (0.755) with
elevated joy and trust. In contrast, demographic framing of queries produced
only marginal variations in emotional tone. Statistical analyses confirmed
significant model-specific and condition-specific differences, while
demographic influences remained minimal. These findings highlight the critical
importance of model selection in mental health applications, as each LLM
exhibits a distinct emotional signature that could significantly impact user
experience and outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs的安全机制导致模型拒绝表面上类似有害内容的良性指令，降低了生产应用的实用性。

Method: 通过分析LLMs在嵌入空间中的轨迹模式，提出SafeConstellations方法，在推理时引导模型避免过度拒绝。

Result: 该方法将过度拒绝率降低高达73%，且对实用性影响最小。

Conclusion: SafeConstellations提供了一种减少LLMs过度拒绝行为的有效方法，同时保持模型性能。

Abstract: LLMs increasingly exhibit over-refusal behavior, where safety mechanisms
cause models to reject benign instructions that superficially resemble harmful
content. This phenomena diminishes utility in production applications that
repeatedly rely on common prompt templates or applications that frequently rely
on LLMs for specific tasks (e.g. sentiment analysis, language translation).
Through comprehensive evaluation, we demonstrate that LLMs still tend to refuse
responses to harmful instructions when those instructions are reframed to
appear as benign tasks. Our mechanistic analysis reveal that LLMs follow
distinct "constellation" patterns in embedding space as representations
traverse layers, with each task maintaining consistent trajectories that shift
predictably between refusal and non-refusal cases. We introduce
SafeConstellations, an inference-time trajectory-shifting approach that tracks
task-specific trajectory patterns and guides representations toward non-refusal
pathways. By selectively guiding model behavior only on tasks prone to
over-refusal, and by preserving general model behavior, our method reduces
over-refusal rates by up to 73% with minimal impact on utility-offering a
principled approach to mitigating over-refusals.

Abstract: The growing interest in automatic survey generation (ASG), a task that
traditionally required considerable time and effort, has been spurred by recent
advances in large language models (LLMs). With advancements in
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and the rising popularity of multi-agent
systems (MASs), synthesizing academic surveys using LLMs has become a viable
approach, thereby elevating the need for robust evaluation methods in this
domain. However, existing evaluation methods suffer from several limitations,
including biased metrics, a lack of human preference, and an over-reliance on
LLMs-as-judges. To address these challenges, we propose SGSimEval, a
comprehensive benchmark for Survey Generation with Similarity-Enhanced
Evaluation that evaluates automatic survey generation systems by integrating
assessments of the outline, content, and references, and also combines
LLM-based scoring with quantitative metrics to provide a multifaceted
evaluation framework. In SGSimEval, we also introduce human preference metrics
that emphasize both inherent quality and similarity to humans. Extensive
experiments reveal that current ASG systems demonstrate human-comparable
superiority in outline generation, while showing significant room for
improvement in content and reference generation, and our evaluation metrics
maintain strong consistency with human assessments.

Abstract: The proliferation of high-quality text from Large Language Models (LLMs)
demands reliable and efficient detection methods. While existing training-free
approaches show promise, they often rely on surface-level statistics and
overlook fundamental signal properties of the text generation process. In this
work, we reframe detection as a signal processing problem, introducing a novel
paradigm that analyzes the sequence of token log-probabilities in the frequency
domain. By systematically analyzing the signal's spectral properties using the
global Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and the local Short-Time Fourier
Transform (STFT), we find that human-written text consistently exhibits
significantly higher spectral energy. This higher energy reflects the
larger-amplitude fluctuations inherent in human writing compared to the
suppressed dynamics of LLM-generated text. Based on this key insight, we
construct SpecDetect, a detector built on a single, robust feature from the
global DFT: DFT total energy. We also propose an enhanced version,
SpecDetect++, which incorporates a sampling discrepancy mechanism to further
boost robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
outperforms the state-of-the-art model while running in nearly half the time.
Our work introduces a new, efficient, and interpretable pathway for
LLM-generated text detection, showing that classical signal processing
techniques offer a surprisingly powerful solution to this modern challenge.

Abstract: Automated feedback generation has the potential to enhance students' learning
progress by providing timely and targeted feedback. Moreover, it can assist
teachers in optimizing their time, allowing them to focus on more strategic and
personalized aspects of teaching. To generate high-quality, information-rich
formative feedback, it is essential first to extract relevant indicators, as
these serve as the foundation upon which the feedback is constructed. Teachers
often employ feedback criteria grids composed of various indicators that they
evaluate systematically. This study examines the initial phase of extracting
such indicators from students' submissions of a language learning course using
the large language model Llama 3.1. Accordingly, the alignment between
indicators generated by the LLM and human ratings across various feedback
criteria is investigated. The findings demonstrate statistically significant
strong correlations, even in cases involving unanticipated combinations of
indicators and criteria. The methodology employed in this paper offers a
promising foundation for extracting indicators from students' submissions using
LLMs. Such indicators can potentially be utilized to auto-generate explainable
and transparent formative feedback in future research.

Abstract: This technical report details a novel approach to combining reasoning and
retrieval augmented generation (RAG) within a single, lean language model
architecture. While existing RAG systems typically rely on large-scale models
and external APIs, our work addresses the increasing demand for performant and
privacy-preserving solutions deployable in resource-constrained or secure
environments. Building on recent developments in test-time scaling and
small-scale reasoning models, we develop a retrieval augmented conversational
agent capable of interpreting complex, domain-specific queries using a
lightweight backbone model. Our system integrates a dense retriever with
fine-tuned Qwen2.5-Instruct models, using synthetic query generation and
reasoning traces derived from frontier models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) over a
curated corpus, in this case, the NHS A-to-Z condition pages. We explore the
impact of summarisation-based document compression, synthetic data design, and
reasoning-aware fine-tuning on model performance. Evaluation against both
non-reasoning and general-purpose lean models demonstrates that our
domain-specific fine-tuning approach yields substantial gains in answer
accuracy and consistency, approaching frontier-level performance while
remaining feasible for local deployment. All implementation details and code
are publicly released to support reproducibility and adaptation across domains.

Abstract: Concurrent to the rapid progress in the development of neural-network based
models in areas like natural language processing and computer vision, the need
for creating explanations for the predictions of these black-box models has
risen steadily. We propose a new method to generate extractive explanations for
predictions made by neural networks, that is based on masking parts of the
input which the model does not consider to be indicative of the respective
class. The masking is done using gradient-based optimization combined with a
new regularization scheme that enforces sufficiency, comprehensiveness and
compactness of the generated explanation, three properties that are known to be
desirable from the related field of rationale extraction in natural language
processing. In this way, we bridge the gap between model interpretability and
rationale extraction, thereby proving that the latter of which can be performed
without training a specialized model, only on the basis of a trained
classifier. We further apply the same method to image inputs and obtain high
quality explanations for image classifications, which indicates that the
conditions proposed for rationale extraction in natural language processing are
more broadly applicable to different input types.

TL;DR: 提出一种端到端可微训练范式，用于稳定训练基于Transformer的分类器，并同时生成输入标记的相关性评分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖三个独立模型（选择器、分类器和互补分类器），训练不稳定且效率低。

Method: 简化三玩家游戏范式，用一个模型同时完成三个角色，并结合类相关性和正则化技术。

Result: 显著提升与人类标注的对齐效果，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: 新方法更高效稳定，且无需显式监督即可生成高质量的类相关解释。

Abstract: We propose an end-to-end differentiable training paradigm for stable training
of a rationalized transformer classifier. Our approach results in a single
model that simultaneously classifies a sample and scores input tokens based on
their relevance to the classification. To this end, we build on the widely-used
three-player-game for training rationalized models, which typically relies on
training a rationale selector, a classifier and a complement classifier. We
simplify this approach by making a single model fulfill all three roles,
leading to a more efficient training paradigm that is not susceptible to the
common training instabilities that plague existing approaches. Further, we
extend this paradigm to produce class-wise rationales while incorporating
recent advances in parameterizing and regularizing the resulting rationales,
thus leading to substantially improved and state-of-the-art alignment with
human annotations without any explicit supervision.

TL;DR: 通过微调大型语言模型回答价值观调查问题，可以显著改变其在下游任务中的行为，实现价值观对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型隐式编码了人类价值观偏好，但通常需要大量训练数据来引导。本研究探索是否可以通过简单的微调方法改变模型的价值系统。

Method: 首先构建多个开源LLM的价值观基线，然后通过微调价值观调查问题来调整模型的价值系统，并在域内和域外任务中评估效果。

Result: 微调不仅能改变模型对域内调查问题的回答，还能显著影响其在域外任务（如道德判断和文本冒险游戏）中的行为。

Conclusion: 简单的微调方法可以有效调整模型的价值系统，实现价值观对齐。

Abstract: Large language models implicitly encode preferences over human values, yet
steering them often requires large training data. In this work, we investigate
a simple approach: Can we reliably modify a model's value system in downstream
behavior by training it to answer value survey questions accordingly? We first
construct value profiles of several open-source LLMs by asking them to rate a
series of value-related descriptions spanning 20 distinct human values, which
we use as a baseline for subsequent experiments. We then investigate whether
the value system of a model can be governed by fine-tuning on the value
surveys. We evaluate the effect of finetuning on the model's behavior in two
ways; first, we assess how answers change on in-domain, held-out survey
questions. Second, we evaluate whether the model's behavior changes in
out-of-domain settings (situational scenarios). To this end, we construct a
contextualized moral judgment dataset based on Reddit posts and evaluate
changes in the model's behavior in text-based adventure games. We demonstrate
that our simple approach can not only change the model's answers to in-domain
survey questions, but also produces substantial shifts (value alignment) in
implicit downstream task behavior.

TL;DR: HumorPlanSearch是一个模块化流程，通过多阶段建模上下文提升AI生成幽默的质量，显著优于基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型生成的幽默常显得通用、重复或不合时宜，因幽默高度依赖文化和情境。

Method: 采用Plan-Search、Humor Chain-of-Thought模板、知识图谱、新颖性过滤和迭代修订循环。

Result: 实验显示，完整流程（知识图谱+修订）将平均幽默生成评分提升15.4%。

Conclusion: HumorPlanSearch通过多阶段上下文建模，使AI幽默更连贯、适应性强且文化敏感。

Abstract: Automated humor generation with Large Language Models (LLMs) often yields
jokes that feel generic, repetitive, or tone-deaf because humor is deeply
situated and hinges on the listener's cultural background, mindset, and
immediate context. We introduce HumorPlanSearch, a modular pipeline that
explicitly models context through: (1) Plan-Search for diverse, topic-tailored
strategies; (2) Humor Chain-of-Thought (HuCoT) templates capturing cultural and
stylistic reasoning; (3) a Knowledge Graph to retrieve and adapt
high-performing historical strategies; (4) novelty filtering via semantic
embeddings; and (5) an iterative judge-driven revision loop. To evaluate
context sensitivity and comedic quality, we propose the Humor Generation Score
(HGS), which fuses direct ratings, multi-persona feedback, pairwise win-rates,
and topic relevance. In experiments across nine topics with feedback from 13
human judges, our full pipeline (KG + Revision) boosts mean HGS by 15.4 percent
(p < 0.05) over a strong baseline. By foregrounding context at every stage from
strategy planning to multi-signal evaluation, HumorPlanSearch advances
AI-driven humor toward more coherent, adaptive, and culturally attuned comedy.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在区分反性别歧视言论与性别歧视言论时的困难，发现模型常将反性别歧视言论误判为有害内容，尤其是在政治敏感事件中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化内容审核系统可能误判反性别歧视言论，导致挑战性别歧视的声音被压制，影响民主辩论。

Method: 研究分析了五种LLMs对英国2022年涉及女性议员的推文分类情况，重点关注高显著性触发事件。

Result: 模型常将反性别歧视言论误判为有害，尤其是在政治敏感事件中，可能压制边缘化声音。

Conclusion: 建议审核设计应超越二元分类，整合人工审核，并在训练数据中明确包含反言论，以保护数字政治空间中的抵抗言论。

Abstract: Anti-sexist speech, i.e., public expressions that challenge or resist
gendered abuse and sexism, plays a vital role in shaping democratic debate
online. Yet automated content moderation systems, increasingly powered by large
language models (LLMs), may struggle to distinguish such resistance from the
sexism it opposes. This study examines how five LLMs classify sexist,
anti-sexist, and neutral political tweets from the UK, focusing on
high-salience trigger events involving female Members of Parliament in the year
2022. Our analysis show that models frequently misclassify anti-sexist speech
as harmful, particularly during politically charged events where rhetorical
styles of harm and resistance converge. These errors risk silencing those who
challenge sexism, with disproportionate consequences for marginalised voices.
We argue that moderation design must move beyond binary harmful/not-harmful
schemas, integrate human-in-the-loop review during sensitive events, and
explicitly include counter-speech in training data. By linking feminist
scholarship, event-based analysis, and model evaluation, this work highlights
the sociotechnical challenges of safeguarding resistance speech in digital
political spaces.

TL;DR: CoDiEmb框架通过任务专用目标、动态采样和模型融合策略，解决了信息检索（IR）和语义文本相似性（STS）任务联合训练中的负迁移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联合训练单一编码器用于IR和STS任务时，负迁移问题导致性能下降，需要系统化解耦任务特定学习信号。

Method: CoDiEmb结合任务专用目标（如对比损失和顺序感知目标）、动态采样、delta引导的模型融合策略，以及高效的单阶段训练流程。

Result: 在15个基准测试中，CoDiEmb不仅缓解了跨任务性能折衷，还改善了嵌入空间的几何特性。

Conclusion: CoDiEmb通过创新方法有效解决了IR和STS任务的联合训练挑战，提升了统一文本嵌入的性能。

Abstract: Learning unified text embeddings that excel across diverse downstream tasks
is a central goal in representation learning, yet negative transfer remains a
persistent obstacle. This challenge is particularly pronounced when jointly
training a single encoder for Information Retrieval (IR) and Semantic Textual
Similarity (STS), two essential but fundamentally disparate tasks for which
naive co-training typically yields steep performance trade-offs. We argue that
resolving this conflict requires systematically decoupling task-specific
learning signals throughout the training pipeline. To this end, we introduce
CoDiEmb, a unified framework that reconciles the divergent requirements of IR
and STS in a collaborative yet distinct manner. CoDiEmb integrates three key
innovations for effective joint optimization: (1) Task-specialized objectives
paired with a dynamic sampler that forms single-task batches and balances
per-task updates, thereby preventing gradient interference. For IR, we employ a
contrastive loss with multiple positives and hard negatives, augmented by
cross-device sampling. For STS, we adopt order-aware objectives that directly
optimize correlation and ranking consistency. (2) A delta-guided model fusion
strategy that computes fine-grained merging weights for checkpoints by
analyzing each parameter's deviation from its pre-trained initialization,
proving more effective than traditional Model Soups. (3) An efficient,
single-stage training pipeline that is simple to implement and converges
stably. Extensive experiments on 15 standard IR and STS benchmarks across three
base encoders validate CoDiEmb. Our results and analysis demonstrate that the
framework not only mitigates cross-task trade-offs but also measurably improves
the geometric properties of the embedding space.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有情感分析主要基于文本，但营销理论指出客户评价还受其他参考点影响，因此研究补充信息的作用。

Method: 比较自然语言和JSON格式提示，使用轻量级3B参数模型，在Yelp两个类别（餐厅和夜生活）上进行实验。

Result: JSON提示表现最佳，Macro-F1提升1.6%和4%，RMSE降低16%和9.1%，适合资源受限设备部署。

Conclusion: 结构化提示可使小模型达到竞争性能，为大规模模型部署提供实用替代方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now widely used across many fields,
including marketing research. Sentiment analysis, in particular, helps firms
understand consumer preferences. While most NLP studies classify sentiment from
review text alone, marketing theories, such as prospect theory and
expectation--disconfirmation theory, point out that customer evaluations are
shaped not only by the actual experience but also by additional reference
points. This study therefore investigates how the content and format of such
supplementary information affect sentiment analysis using LLMs. We compare
natural language (NL) and JSON-formatted prompts using a lightweight 3B
parameter model suitable for practical marketing applications. Experiments on
two Yelp categories (Restaurant and Nightlife) show that the JSON prompt with
additional information outperforms all baselines without fine-tuning: Macro-F1
rises by 1.6% and 4% while RMSE falls by 16% and 9.1%, respectively, making it
deployable in resource-constrained edge devices. Furthermore, a follow-up
analysis confirms that performance gains stem from genuine contextual reasoning
rather than label proxying. This work demonstrates that structured prompting
can enable smaller models to achieve competitive performance, offering a
practical alternative to large-scale model deployment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）是否表现出物种主义偏见及其对非人类动物的评价，发现LLMs能识别物种主义言论但很少谴责，且在某些情况下更倾向于人类而非动物。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs的广泛应用，研究其伦理倾向，尤其是物种主义偏见，对AI公平性和道德对齐至关重要。

Method: 通过三个范式研究：1）SpeciesismBench基准测试；2）心理学测量比较模型与人类反应；3）文本生成任务测试物种主义合理化。

Result: LLMs能识别物种主义言论但很少谴责，在心理测量中表现复杂，倾向于人类而非动物，但在能力平等时无物种偏好。

Conclusion: 需扩展AI公平性框架以包含非人类道德主体，减少物种主义偏见在AI系统中的固化。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become more widely deployed, it is crucial to
examine their ethical tendencies. Building on research on fairness and
discrimination in AI, we investigate whether LLMs exhibit speciesist bias --
discrimination based on species membership -- and how they value non-human
animals. We systematically examine this issue across three paradigms: (1)
SpeciesismBench, a 1,003-item benchmark assessing recognition and moral
evaluation of speciesist statements; (2) established psychological measures
comparing model responses with those of human participants; (3) text-generation
tasks probing elaboration on, or resistance to, speciesist rationalizations. In
our benchmark, LLMs reliably detected speciesist statements but rarely
condemned them, often treating speciesist attitudes as morally acceptable. On
psychological measures, results were mixed: LLMs expressed slightly lower
explicit speciesism than people, yet in direct trade-offs they more often chose
to save one human over multiple animals. A tentative interpretation is that
LLMs may weight cognitive capacity rather than species per se: when capacities
were equal, they showed no species preference, and when an animal was described
as more capable, they tended to prioritize it over a less capable human. In
open-ended text generation tasks, LLMs frequently normalized or rationalized
harm toward farmed animals while refusing to do so for non-farmed animals.
These findings suggest that while LLMs reflect a mixture of progressive and
mainstream human views, they nonetheless reproduce entrenched cultural norms
around animal exploitation. We argue that expanding AI fairness and alignment
frameworks to explicitly include non-human moral patients is essential for
reducing these biases and preventing the entrenchment of speciesist attitudes
in AI systems and the societies they influence.

<details>

Motivation: 研究动机是解决认知科学和神经科学中长期存在的语言表征与概念表征分离问题，并探索LMs是否内部表征跨模态概念。

Method: 通过分析大脑激活水平（语言处理）和跨模态概念一致性（句子、词云、图像）的神经指标，结合fMRI数据，评估LMs与大脑的对齐关系。

Result: 实验表明，语言模型能更好地预测大脑中对概念一致性更强的区域信号，即使这些区域对语言处理不敏感。

Conclusion: 结论是LMs可能内部表征跨模态概念意义，支持其在语言和概念理解上的潜力。

Abstract: Cognitive science and neuroscience have long faced the challenge of
disentangling representations of language from representations of conceptual
meaning. As the same problem arises in today's language models (LMs), we
investigate the relationship between LM--brain alignment and two neural
metrics: (1) the level of brain activation during processing of sentences,
targeting linguistic processing, and (2) a novel measure of meaning consistency
across input modalities, which quantifies how consistently a brain region
responds to the same concept across paradigms (sentence, word cloud, image)
using an fMRI dataset (Pereira et al., 2018). Our experiments show that both
language-only and language-vision models predict the signal better in more
meaning-consistent areas of the brain, even when these areas are not strongly
sensitive to language processing, suggesting that LMs might internally
represent cross-modal conceptual meaning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统心理健康评估依赖专业人员且静态文本分析能力有限，无法捕捉动态交互中的深层信息。

Method: 采用多代理框架，包括提问、评估、评分和更新代理，结合自适应提问机制和树状记忆结构。

Result: 在DAIC-WOZ数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过动态交互和记忆更新，显著提升了心理健康评估的效果。

Abstract: Mental health assessment is crucial for early intervention and effective
treatment, yet traditional clinician-based approaches are limited by the
shortage of qualified professionals. Recent advances in artificial intelligence
have sparked growing interest in automated psychological assessment, yet most
existing approaches are constrained by their reliance on static text analysis,
limiting their ability to capture deeper and more informative insights that
emerge through dynamic interaction and iterative questioning. Therefore, in
this paper, we propose a multi-agent framework for mental health evaluation
that simulates clinical doctor-patient dialogues, with specialized agents
assigned to questioning, adequacy evaluation, scoring, and updating. We
introduce an adaptive questioning mechanism in which an evaluation agent
assesses the adequacy of user responses to determine the necessity of
generating targeted follow-up queries to address ambiguity and missing
information. Additionally, we employ a tree-structured memory in which the root
node encodes the user's basic information, while child nodes (e.g., topic and
statement) organize key information according to distinct symptom categories
and interaction turns. This memory is dynamically updated throughout the
interaction to reduce redundant questioning and further enhance the information
extraction and contextual tracking capabilities. Experimental results on the
DAIC-WOZ dataset illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, which
achieves better performance than existing approaches.

Result: 减少49.27%的响应token，提升6.59倍token效率，训练时间减少5倍，极端训练下准确率提升16%。

Conclusion: DR. SAF在资源受限环境中高效平衡推理效率与准确性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have greatly improved
their capabilities on complex reasoning tasks through Long Chain-of-Thought
(CoT). However, this approach often results in substantial redundancy,
impairing computational efficiency and causing significant delays in real-time
applications. To improve the efficiency, current methods often rely on
human-defined difficulty priors, which do not align with the LLM's self-awared
difficulty, leading to inefficiencies. In this paper, we introduce the Dynamic
Reasoning-Boundary Self-Awareness Framework (DR. SAF), which enables models to
dynamically assess and adjust their reasoning depth in response to problem
complexity. DR. SAF integrates three key components: Boundary Self-Awareness
Alignment, Adaptive Reward Management, and a Boundary Preservation Mechanism.
These components allow models to optimize their reasoning processes, balancing
efficiency and accuracy without compromising performance. Our experimental
results demonstrate that DR. SAF achieves a 49.27% reduction in total response
tokens with minimal loss in accuracy. The framework also delivers a 6.59x gain
in token efficiency and a 5x reduction in training time, making it well-suited
to resource-limited settings. During extreme training, DR. SAF can even surpass
traditional instruction-based models in token efficiency with more than 16%
accuracy improvement.

Motivation: 现有视觉蕴含数据集规模小且稀疏，手动创建成本高，合成数据为解决数据稀疏问题提供了可能。

Method: 基于SNLI文本数据集，使用Stable Diffusion生成图像替代文本前提，构建合成数据集，并通过CLIP特征向量训练视觉蕴含分类器进行内外评估。

Result: 合成数据在SNLI-VE和SICK-VTE数据集上性能接近真实数据（F-score分别为0.686 vs 0.703和0.384 vs 0.400）。

Conclusion: 在数据稀疏场景下，合成数据是训练视觉蕴含模型的有效替代方案。

Abstract: In this paper we present and validate a new synthetic dataset for training
visual entailment models. Existing datasets for visual entailment are small and
sparse compared to datasets for textual entailment. Manually creating datasets
is labor-intensive. We base our synthetic dataset on the SNLI dataset for
textual entailment. We take the premise text from SNLI as input prompts in a
generative image model, Stable Diffusion, creating an image to replace each
textual premise. We evaluate our dataset both intrinsically and extrinsically.
For extrinsic evaluation, we evaluate the validity of the generated images by
using them as training data for a visual entailment classifier based on CLIP
feature vectors. We find that synthetic training data only leads to a slight
drop in quality on SNLI-VE, with an F-score 0.686 compared to 0.703 when
trained on real data. We also compare the quality of our generated training
data to original training data on another dataset: SICK-VTE. Again, there is
only a slight drop in F-score: from 0.400 to 0.384. These results indicate that
in settings with data sparsity, synthetic data can be a promising solution for
training visual entailment models.

significantly reduces biometric identifiability with minimal utility
degradation. Unlike prior methods in this direction, our framework retains
physiologically plausible gaze patterns suitable for downstream use, which
produces favorable privacy-utility trade-off. This work advances privacy in
gaze-based systems by providing a usable and effective mechanism for protecting

Motivation: 随着智能手机和VR/AR技术的普及，环境中可能出现更多与虚拟元素连接的物体，识别这些物体是触发后续交互的第一步。Artcodes作为一种拓扑编码的标记，需要被高效检测。

Method: 提出了一种新的特征描述符——形状方向直方图，用于描述Artcodes的通用拓扑结构，并构建了检测系统进行实验验证。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提出的特征向量能有效表示拓扑结构，检测系统在Artcode识别中表现良好。

Conclusion: 尽管是初步尝试，但该研究为拓扑物体检测开辟了新方向，并可能激发更多应用。

Abstract: The increasing ubiquity of smartphones and resurgence of VR/AR techniques, it
is expected that our everyday environment may soon be decorating with objects
connecting with virtual elements. Alerting to the presence of these objects is
therefore the first step for motivating follow-up further inspection and
triggering digital material attached to the objects. This work studies a
special kind of these objects -- Artcodes -- a human-meaningful and
machine-readable decorative markers that camouflage themselves with freeform
appearance by encoding information into their topology. We formulate this
problem of recongising the presence of Artcodes as Artcode proposal detection,
a distinct computer vision task that classifies topologically similar but
geometrically and semantically different objects as a same class. To deal with
this problem, we propose a new feature descriptor, called the shape of
orientation histogram, to describe the generic topological structure of an
Artcode. We collect datasets and conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate
the performance of the Artcode detection proposer built upon this new feature
vector. Our experimental results show the feasibility of the proposed feature
vector for representing topological structures and the effectiveness of the
system for detecting Artcode proposals. Although this work is an initial
attempt to develop a feature-based system for detecting topological objects
like Artcodes, it would open up new interaction opportunities and spark
potential applications of topological object detection.

Conclusion: 指出当前局限并提出未来研究方向，鼓励访问资源库获取更多细节。

Abstract: The recent advancement in video temporal grounding (VTG) has significantly
enhanced fine-grained video understanding, primarily driven by multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). With superior multimodal comprehension and reasoning
abilities, VTG approaches based on MLLMs (VTG-MLLMs) are gradually surpassing
traditional fine-tuned methods. They not only achieve competitive performance
but also excel in generalization across zero-shot, multi-task, and multi-domain
settings. Despite extensive surveys on general video-language understanding,
comprehensive reviews specifically addressing VTG-MLLMs remain scarce. To fill
this gap, this survey systematically examines current research on VTG-MLLMs

highlighting their architectural significance; 2) training paradigms, analyzing
strategies for temporal reasoning and task adaptation; and 3) video feature

Abstract: By integrating the perception capabilities of multimodal encoders with the
generative power of Large Language Models (LLMs), Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs), exemplified by GPT-4V, have achieved great success in various
multimodal tasks, pointing toward a promising pathway to artificial general
intelligence. Despite this progress, the limited quality of multimodal data,
poor performance on many complex downstream tasks, and inadequate evaluation
protocols continue to hinder the reliability and broader applicability of MLLMs
across diverse domains. Inspired by the human ability to leverage external
tools for enhanced reasoning and problem-solving, augmenting MLLMs with
external tools (e.g., APIs, expert models, and knowledge bases) offers a
promising strategy to overcome these challenges. In this paper, we present a
comprehensive survey on leveraging external tools to enhance MLLM performance.
Our discussion is structured along four key dimensions about external tools:
(1) how they can facilitate the acquisition and annotation of high-quality
multimodal data; (2) how they can assist in improving MLLM performance on
challenging downstream tasks; (3) how they enable comprehensive and accurate
evaluation of MLLMs; (4) the current limitations and future directions of
tool-augmented MLLMs. Through this survey, we aim to underscore the
transformative potential of external tools in advancing MLLM capabilities,
offering a forward-looking perspective on their development and applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VSF是一种通过翻转负提示的注意力值符号来动态抑制不需要内容的方法，适用于少步扩散和流匹配图像生成模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如CFG、NASA和NAG）在负提示引导方面存在不足，VSF旨在提供一种更高效且计算开销小的解决方案。

Method: VSF通过翻转负提示的注意力值符号动态抑制不需要的内容，适用于MMDiT和交叉注意力模型。

Result: 实验表明，VSF在少步模型中显著提升负提示的遵循能力，同时保持图像质量。

Conclusion: VSF是一种高效且性能优越的负提示引导方法，适用于多种生成任务。

Abstract: We introduce Value Sign Flip (VSF), a simple and efficient method for
incorporating negative prompt guidance in few-step diffusion and flow-matching
image generation models. Unlike existing approaches such as classifier-free
guidance (CFG), NASA, and NAG, VSF dynamically suppresses undesired content by
flipping the sign of attention values from negative prompts. Our method
requires only small computational overhead and integrates effectively with
MMDiT-style architectures such as Stable Diffusion 3.5 Turbo, as well as
cross-attention-based models like Wan. We validate VSF on challenging datasets
with complex prompt pairs and demonstrate superior performance in both static
image and video generation tasks. Experimental results show that VSF
significantly improves negative prompt adherence compared to prior methods in
few-step models, and even CFG in non-few-step models, while maintaining
competitive image quality. Code and ComfyUI node are available in

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出MV-ScanQA数据集和TripAlign预训练语料库，以解决现有3D视觉语言数据集在远距离多视角推理和上下文对齐方面的不足，并开发了LEGO方法，在多个任务上取得最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D视觉语言数据集缺乏远距离多视角推理和上下文对齐，限制了模型的深度场景理解能力。

Method: 提出MV-ScanQA数据集测试多视角推理，TripAlign语料库提供2D-3D-语言对齐预训练数据，并开发LEGO方法进行知识迁移。

Result: LEGO在MV-ScanQA和现有3D密集描述与问答任务上均达到最优性能。

Conclusion: MV-ScanQA和TripAlign填补了3D视觉语言学习的空白，LEGO方法展示了多视角推理的潜力。

Abstract: The advancement of 3D vision-language (3D VL) learning is hindered by several
limitations in existing 3D VL datasets: they rarely necessitate reasoning
beyond a close range of objects in single viewpoint, and annotations often link
instructions to single objects, missing richer contextual alignments between
multiple objects. This significantly curtails the development of models capable
of deep, multi-view 3D scene understanding over distant objects. To address
these challenges, we introduce MV-ScanQA, a novel 3D question answering dataset
where 68% of questions explicitly require integrating information from multiple
views (compared to less than 7% in existing datasets), thereby rigorously
testing multi-view compositional reasoning. To facilitate the training of
models for such demanding scenarios, we present TripAlign dataset, a
large-scale and low-cost 2D-3D-language pre-training corpus containing 1M <2D
view, set of 3D objects, text> triplets that explicitly aligns groups of
contextually related objects with text, providing richer, view-grounded
multi-object multimodal alignment signals than previous single-object
annotations. We further develop LEGO, a baseline method for the multi-view
reasoning challenge in MV-ScanQA, transferring knowledge from pre-trained 2D
LVLMs to 3D domain with TripAlign. Empirically, LEGO pre-trained on TripAlign
achieves state-of-the-art performance not only on the proposed MV-ScanQA, but
also on existing benchmarks for 3D dense captioning and question answering.

*Yoli Shavit,Yosi Keller*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于相机姿态自动编码器（PAE）的相对姿态回归（RPR）方法，结合视觉和空间先验，提升单图像绝对姿态回归（APR）的定位精度，且无需额外存储数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代零售环境中，精准的相机定位对提升用户体验和自动化运营至关重要。现有APR方法虽有效，但结合视觉和空间先验的方法精度更高。

Method: 扩展PAE至RPR任务，提出一种基于PAE的RPR重定位方案，无需额外存储图像或姿态数据，通过RPR优化APR预测。

Result: 实验表明，PAE-based RPR优于同架构的图像RPR模型，且在室内基准测试中显著提升APR定位精度，仅需30%数据即可达到竞争性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效减少了零售场景中的数据收集负担，同时提升了定位精度，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Accurate camera localization is crucial for modern retail environments,
enabling enhanced customer experiences, streamlined inventory management, and
autonomous operations. While Absolute Pose Regression (APR) from a single image
offers a promising solution, approaches that incorporate visual and spatial
scene priors tend to achieve higher accuracy. Camera Pose Auto-Encoders (PAEs)
have recently been introduced to embed such priors into APR. In this work, we
extend PAEs to the task of Relative Pose Regression (RPR) and propose a novel
re-localization scheme that refines APR predictions using PAE-based RPR,
without requiring additional storage of images or pose data. We first introduce
PAE-based RPR and establish its effectiveness by comparing it with image-based
RPR models of equivalent architectures. We then demonstrate that our refinement
strategy, driven by a PAE-based RPR, enhances APR localization accuracy on
indoor benchmarks. Notably, our method is shown to achieve competitive
performance even when trained with only 30% of the data, substantially reducing
the data collection burden for retail deployment. Our code and pre-trained
models are available at: https://github.com/yolish/camera-pose-auto-encoders

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViPE是一种高效视频处理引擎，用于从未经约束的原始视频中估计相机内参、相机运动和密集深度图，支持多种场景和相机模型，性能优于现有基线，并开源了大规模标注数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D几何感知方法依赖大规模训练数据，但获取精确的3D标注仍具挑战性。ViPE旨在填补这一空白。

Method: ViPE通过高效算法估计相机内参、运动和密集深度图，适用于动态自拍视频、电影镜头等多种场景，支持多种相机模型。

Result: ViPE在TUM/KITTI序列上比现有基线性能提升18%/50%，运行速度为3-5FPS，并标注了包含100K真实视频、1M AI生成视频和2K全景视频的大规模数据集。

Conclusion: ViPE及其开源数据集有望加速空间AI系统的发展。

Abstract: Accurate 3D geometric perception is an important prerequisite for a wide
range of spatial AI systems. While state-of-the-art methods depend on
large-scale training data, acquiring consistent and precise 3D annotations from
in-the-wild videos remains a key challenge. In this work, we introduce ViPE, a
handy and versatile video processing engine designed to bridge this gap. ViPE
efficiently estimates camera intrinsics, camera motion, and dense, near-metric
depth maps from unconstrained raw videos. It is robust to diverse scenarios,
including dynamic selfie videos, cinematic shots, or dashcams, and supports
various camera models such as pinhole, wide-angle, and 360{\deg} panoramas. We
have benchmarked ViPE on multiple benchmarks. Notably, it outperforms existing
uncalibrated pose estimation baselines by 18%/50% on TUM/KITTI sequences, and
runs at 3-5FPS on a single GPU for standard input resolutions. We use ViPE to
annotate a large-scale collection of videos. This collection includes around
100K real-world internet videos, 1M high-quality AI-generated videos, and 2K
panoramic videos, totaling approximately 96M frames -- all annotated with
accurate camera poses and dense depth maps. We open-source ViPE and the
annotated dataset with the hope of accelerating the development of spatial AI
systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LogicBench是一个用于评估视觉语言模型（VLMs）逻辑理解能力的基准测试，发现现有模型在逻辑任务上表现不佳，提出LogicCLIP框架以提升其逻辑敏感性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型（如CLIP）在逻辑理解方面存在明显不足，限制了其在实际应用中的可靠性。

Method: 提出LogicBench基准测试，包含50,000多个视觉语言对，覆盖9个逻辑类别和4种场景；设计LogicCLIP框架，通过逻辑感知数据生成和多目标对比学习提升模型逻辑能力。

Result: LogicCLIP在LogicBench上显著优于基线模型，同时在通用视觉语言任务上保持或超越竞争性能。

Conclusion: LogicBench和LogicCLIP为提升视觉语言模型的逻辑能力提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), exemplified by CLIP, have emerged as
foundational for multimodal intelligence. However, their capacity for logical
understanding remains significantly underexplored, resulting in critical
''logical blindspots'' that limit their reliability in practical applications.
To systematically diagnose this, we introduce LogicBench, a comprehensive
benchmark with over 50,000 vision-language pairs across 9 logical categories
and 4 diverse scenarios: images, videos, anomaly detection, and medical
diagnostics. Our evaluation reveals that existing VLMs, even the
state-of-the-art ones, fall at over 40 accuracy points below human performance,
particularly in challenging tasks like Causality and Conditionality,
highlighting their reliance on surface semantics over critical logical
structures. To bridge this gap, we propose LogicCLIP, a novel training
framework designed to boost VLMs' logical sensitivity through advancements in
both data generation and optimization objectives. LogicCLIP utilizes
logic-aware data generation and a contrastive learning strategy that combines
coarse-grained alignment, a fine-grained multiple-choice objective, and a novel
logical structure-aware objective. Extensive experiments demonstrate
LogicCLIP's substantial improvements in logical comprehension across all
LogicBench domains, significantly outperforming baselines. Moreover, LogicCLIP
retains, and often surpasses, competitive performance on general
vision-language benchmarks, demonstrating that the enhanced logical
understanding does not come at the expense of general alignment. We believe
that LogicBench and LogicCLIP will be important resources for advancing VLM
logical capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了HQ-OV3D框架，专注于生成高质量伪标签，用于开放词汇3D检测，显著提升几何精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统封闭式3D检测框架无法满足开放世界应用需求，现有开放词汇方法在几何质量（如边界框精度）上表现不足。

Method: 框架包含两个关键组件：IMCV提案生成器（利用跨模态几何一致性生成高质量3D提案）和ACA降噪器（通过DDIM机制利用标注类别的几何先验逐步优化提案）。

Result: 相比现有方法，生成的伪标签在新型类别上mAP提升7.37%。

Conclusion: HQ-OV3D不仅是一个独立的开放词汇3D检测器，还可作为高质量伪标签生成器用于现有检测或标注流程。

Abstract: Traditional closed-set 3D detection frameworks fail to meet the demands of
open-world applications like autonomous driving. Existing open-vocabulary 3D
detection methods typically adopt a two-stage pipeline consisting of
pseudo-label generation followed by semantic alignment. While vision-language
models (VLMs) recently have dramatically improved the semantic accuracy of
pseudo-labels, their geometric quality, particularly bounding box precision,
remains commonly neglected.To address this issue, we propose a High Box Quality
Open-Vocabulary 3D Detection (HQ-OV3D) framework, dedicated to generate and
refine high-quality pseudo-labels for open-vocabulary classes. The framework
comprises two key components: an Intra-Modality Cross-Validated (IMCV) Proposal
Generator that utilizes cross-modality geometric consistency to generate
high-quality initial 3D proposals, and an Annotated-Class Assisted (ACA)
Denoiser that progressively refines 3D proposals by leveraging geometric priors
from annotated categories through a DDIM-based denoising mechanism.Compared to
the state-of-the-art method, training with pseudo-labels generated by our
approach achieves a 7.37% improvement in mAP on novel classes, demonstrating
the superior quality of the pseudo-labels produced by our framework. HQ-OV3D
can serve not only as a strong standalone open-vocabulary 3D detector but also
as a plug-in high-quality pseudo-label generator for existing open-vocabulary
detection or annotation pipelines.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于稀疏3D语义高斯泼溅的协作3D语义占用预测方法，解决了现有方法的高通信成本或依赖深度估计的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在协作感知中存在高通信成本或依赖深度估计的局限性，限制了其适用性。

Method: 通过共享和融合中间高斯基元，实现跨代理融合、几何与语义联合编码，以及稀疏、对象中心的消息传递。

Result: 在mIoU和IoU指标上分别优于单代理感知和基线协作方法，且在低通信量下仍保持高性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在协作感知中表现出高效性和鲁棒性，适用于通信资源有限的场景。

Abstract: Collaborative perception enables connected vehicles to share information,
overcoming occlusions and extending the limited sensing range inherent in
single-agent (non-collaborative) systems. Existing vision-only methods for 3D
semantic occupancy prediction commonly rely on dense 3D voxels, which incur
high communication costs, or 2D planar features, which require accurate depth
estimation or additional supervision, limiting their applicability to
collaborative scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose the first
approach leveraging sparse 3D semantic Gaussian splatting for collaborative 3D
semantic occupancy prediction. By sharing and fusing intermediate Gaussian
primitives, our method provides three benefits: a neighborhood-based
cross-agent fusion that removes duplicates and suppresses noisy or inconsistent
Gaussians; a joint encoding of geometry and semantics in each primitive, which
reduces reliance on depth supervision and allows simple rigid alignment; and
sparse, object-centric messages that preserve structural information while
reducing communication volume. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach outperforms single-agent perception and baseline collaborative methods
by +8.42 and +3.28 points in mIoU, and +5.11 and +22.41 points in IoU,
respectively. When further reducing the number of transmitted Gaussians, our
method still achieves a +1.9 improvement in mIoU, using only 34.6%
communication volume, highlighting robust performance under limited
communication budgets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的面部超分辨率方法（IDFSR），通过身份解耦和拟合技术，解决了极端退化场景下身份信息丢失和幻觉效应的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在极端退化场景（如放大倍数>8×）下，传统方法难以重建真实且身份一致的面部图像，导致生成的图像缺乏真实身份约束。

Method: IDFSR采用三种关键设计：1）掩蔽低分辨率图像中的面部区域；2）对齐参考图像以提供风格指导；3）利用真实图像的ID嵌入进行细粒度建模。通过预训练扩散模型解耦风格和身份，并轻量级微调ID嵌入。

Result: 实验表明，IDFSR在极端退化场景下显著优于现有方法，尤其在身份一致性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: IDFSR通过身份解耦和拟合技术，有效提升了极端退化场景下的面部超分辨率性能，解决了身份信息丢失和幻觉效应问题。

Abstract: In recent years, face super-resolution (FSR) methods have achieved remarkable
progress, generally maintaining high image fidelity and identity (ID)
consistency under standard settings. However, in extreme degradation scenarios
(e.g., scale $> 8\times$), critical attributes and ID information are often
severely lost in the input image, making it difficult for conventional models
to reconstruct realistic and ID-consistent faces. Existing methods tend to
generate hallucinated faces under such conditions, producing restored images
lacking authentic ID constraints. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
FSR method with Identity Decoupling and Fitting (IDFSR), designed to enhance ID
restoration under large scaling factors while mitigating hallucination effects.
Our approach involves three key designs: 1) \textbf{Masking} the facial region
in the low-resolution (LR) image to eliminate unreliable ID cues; 2)
\textbf{Warping} a reference image to align with the LR input, providing style
guidance; 3) Leveraging \textbf{ID embeddings} extracted from ground truth (GT)
images for fine-grained ID modeling and personalized adaptation. We first
pretrain a diffusion-based model to explicitly decouple style and ID by forcing
it to reconstruct masked LR face regions using both style and identity
embeddings. Subsequently, we freeze most network parameters and perform
lightweight fine-tuning of the ID embedding using a small set of target ID
images. This embedding encodes fine-grained facial attributes and precise ID
information, significantly improving both ID consistency and perceptual
quality. Extensive quantitative evaluations and visual comparisons demonstrate
that the proposed IDFSR substantially outperforms existing approaches under
extreme degradation, particularly achieving superior performance on ID
consistency.

Abstract: Accurate identification of wood species plays a critical role in ecological

Traditional classification approaches relying on macroscopic and microscopic
inspection are labor-intensive and require expert knowledge. In this study, we
explore the application of deep learning to automate the classification of ten
wood species commonly found in Vietnam. A custom image dataset was constructed
from field-collected wood samples, and five state-of-the-art convolutional
neural network architectures--ResNet50, EfficientNet, MobileViT, MobileNetV3,
and ShuffleNetV2--were evaluated. Among these, ShuffleNetV2 achieved the best
balance between classification performance and computational efficiency, with
an average accuracy of 99.29\% and F1-score of 99.35\% over 20 independent
runs. These results demonstrate the potential of lightweight deep learning
models for real-time, high-accuracy species identification in
resource-constrained environments. Our work contributes to the growing field of
ecological informatics by providing scalable, image-based solutions for
automated wood classification and forest biodiversity assessment.

Abstract: This paper presents NIRMAL Pooling, a novel pooling layer for Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs) that integrates adaptive max pooling with non-linear
activation function for image classification tasks. The acronym NIRMAL stands
for Non-linear Activation, Intermediate Aggregation, Reduction, Maximum,
Adaptive, and Localized. By dynamically adjusting pooling parameters based on
desired output dimensions and applying a Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)
activation post-pooling, NIRMAL Pooling improves robustness and feature
expressiveness. We evaluated its performance against standard Max Pooling on
three benchmark datasets: MNIST Digits, MNIST Fashion, and CIFAR-10. NIRMAL
Pooling achieves test accuracies of 99.25% (vs. 99.12% for Max Pooling) on
MNIST Digits, 91.59% (vs. 91.44%) on MNIST Fashion, and 70.49% (vs. 68.87%) on
CIFAR-10, demonstrating consistent improvements, particularly on complex
datasets. This work highlights the potential of NIRMAL Pooling to enhance CNN
performance in diverse image recognition tasks, offering a flexible and
reliable alternative to traditional pooling methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解纺织增强复合材料的多尺度结构对预测其力学性能至关重要，嵌套行为直接影响刚度、渗透性和损伤耐受性。

Method: 采用低分辨率CT进行原位压实实验，利用3D-UNet进行语义分割，并通过两点相关函数分析空间结构。

Result: 模型在分割任务中表现优异（IoU为0.822，F1分数为0.902），结果与显微图像验证一致。

Conclusion: 该方法为从工业CT数据中提取关键几何特征提供了可靠途径，并为复合材料预成型体的逆向建模和描述符分析奠定了基础。

Abstract: A detailed understanding of material structure across multiple scales is
essential for predictive modeling of textile-reinforced composites. Nesting --
characterized by the interlocking of adjacent fabric layers through local
interpenetration and misalignment of yarns -- plays a critical role in defining
mechanical properties such as stiffness, permeability, and damage tolerance.
This study presents a framework to quantify nesting behavior in dry textile
reinforcements under compaction using low-resolution computed tomography (CT).
In-situ compaction experiments were conducted on various stacking
configurations, with CT scans acquired at 20.22 $\mu$m per voxel resolution. A
tailored 3D{-}UNet enabled semantic segmentation of matrix, weft, and fill
phases across compaction stages corresponding to fiber volume contents of
50--60 %. The model achieved a minimum mean Intersection-over-Union of 0.822
and an $F1$ score of 0.902. Spatial structure was subsequently analyzed using
the two-point correlation function $S_2$, allowing for probabilistic extraction
of average layer thickness and nesting degree. The results show strong
agreement with micrograph-based validation. This methodology provides a robust
approach for extracting key geometrical features from industrially relevant CT
data and establishes a foundation for reverse modeling and descriptor-based
structural analysis of composite preforms.

Abstract: Potholes on the roads are a serious hazard and maintenance burden. This poses
a significant threat to road safety and vehicle longevity, especially on the
diverse and under-maintained roads of India. In this paper, we present a
complete end-to-end system called iWatchRoad for automated pothole detection,
Global Positioning System (GPS) tagging, and real time mapping using
OpenStreetMap (OSM). We curated a large, self-annotated dataset of over 7,000
frames captured across various road types, lighting conditions, and weather
scenarios unique to Indian environments, leveraging dashcam footage. This
dataset is used to fine-tune, Ultralytics You Only Look Once (YOLO) model to
perform real time pothole detection, while a custom Optical Character
Recognition (OCR) module was employed to extract timestamps directly from video
frames. The timestamps are synchronized with GPS logs to geotag each detected
potholes accurately. The processed data includes the potholes' details and
frames as metadata is stored in a database and visualized via a user friendly
web interface using OSM. iWatchRoad not only improves detection accuracy under
challenging conditions but also provides government compatible outputs for road
assessment and maintenance planning through the metadata visible on the
website. Our solution is cost effective, hardware efficient, and scalable,
offering a practical tool for urban and rural road management in developing
regions, making the system automated. iWatchRoad is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为增量补丁生成（IPG）的方法，能高效生成对抗性补丁，比现有方法快11.1倍，同时保持攻击性能。实验证明IPG能生成泛化性强的补丁，覆盖更广的模型漏洞，并可用于构建鲁棒模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗性补丁对AI模型的鲁棒性构成挑战，尤其在计算机视觉任务中。传统对抗性示例仅针对图像特定区域，导致模型失效。

Method: 提出IPG方法，通过增量生成对抗性补丁，结合YOLO特征分布可视化和对抗训练实验验证其有效性。

Result: IPG生成的补丁效率高且泛化性强，能覆盖更多模型漏洞，生成的补丁数据集可用于构建鲁棒模型。

Conclusion: IPG在对抗性补丁防御和实际应用（如自动驾驶、安防系统、医学影像）中具有潜力，能提升AI模型在动态高风险环境中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: The advent of adversarial patches poses a significant challenge to the
robustness of AI models, particularly in the domain of computer vision tasks
such as object detection. In contradistinction to traditional adversarial
examples, these patches target specific regions of an image, resulting in the
malfunction of AI models. This paper proposes Incremental Patch Generation
(IPG), a method that generates adversarial patches up to 11.1 times more
efficiently than existing approaches while maintaining comparable attack
performance. The efficacy of IPG is demonstrated by experiments and ablation
studies including YOLO's feature distribution visualization and adversarial
training results, which show that it produces well-generalized patches that
effectively cover a broader range of model vulnerabilities. Furthermore,
IPG-generated datasets can serve as a robust knowledge foundation for
constructing a robust model, enabling structured representation, advanced
reasoning, and proactive defenses in AI security ecosystems. The findings of
this study suggest that IPG has considerable potential for future utilization
not only in adversarial patch defense but also in real-world applications such
as autonomous vehicles, security systems, and medical imaging, where AI models
must remain resilient to adversarial attacks in dynamic and high-stakes
environments.

TL;DR: MedAtlas是一个新的医学多模态基准框架，旨在评估大型语言模型在真实医学推理任务中的表现，填补现有基准的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学多模态基准通常局限于单图像、单任务，无法反映临床实践中的多模态交互和纵向特性。

Method: MedAtlas引入多轮对话、多模态医学图像交互、多任务集成和高临床保真度，支持四种核心任务。

Result: 基准测试显示现有模型在多阶段临床推理中存在显著性能差距。

Conclusion: MedAtlas为开发稳健可信的医学AI提供了具有挑战性的评估平台。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has demonstrated significant potential in clinical
decision-making; however, developing models capable of adapting to diverse
real-world scenarios and performing complex diagnostic reasoning remains a
major challenge. Existing medical multi-modal benchmarks are typically limited
to single-image, single-turn tasks, lacking multi-modal medical image
integration and failing to capture the longitudinal and multi-modal interactive
nature inherent to clinical practice. To address this gap, we introduce
MedAtlas, a novel benchmark framework designed to evaluate large language
models on realistic medical reasoning tasks. MedAtlas is characterized by four
key features: multi-turn dialogue, multi-modal medical image interaction,
multi-task integration, and high clinical fidelity. It supports four core
tasks: open-ended multi-turn question answering, closed-ended multi-turn
question answering, multi-image joint reasoning, and comprehensive disease
diagnosis. Each case is derived from real diagnostic workflows and incorporates
temporal interactions between textual medical histories and multiple imaging
modalities, including CT, MRI, PET, ultrasound, and X-ray, requiring models to
perform deep integrative reasoning across images and clinical texts. MedAtlas
provides expert-annotated gold standards for all tasks. Furthermore, we propose
two novel evaluation metrics: Round Chain Accuracy and Error Propagation
Resistance. Benchmark results with existing multi-modal models reveal
substantial performance gaps in multi-stage clinical reasoning. MedAtlas
establishes a challenging evaluation platform to advance the development of
robust and trustworthy medical AI.

TL;DR: FastFOD-Net是一种基于深度学习的FOD增强框架，显著提升了临床扩散MRI数据的分析效率和准确性，适用于多种神经系统疾病研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决临床单壳低角分辨率扩散MRI数据生成可靠FOD的挑战，并验证深度学习增强技术在临床中的适用性。

Method: 采用优化的端到端深度学习框架FastFOD-Net，对FOD进行高效增强，比前代快60倍。

Result: 在健康对照和六种神经系统疾病中验证了FastFOD-Net的优越性能，提升了临床扩散MRI分析的可靠性和效率。

Conclusion: FastFOD-Net有望加速临床神经科学研究，增强扩散MRI在疾病区分和连接组应用中的实用性，推动深度学习方法的临床普及。

Abstract: Fiber orientation distribution (FOD) is an advanced diffusion MRI modeling
technique that represents complex white matter fiber configurations, and a key
step for subsequent brain tractography and connectome analysis. Its reliability
and accuracy, however, heavily rely on the quality of the MRI acquisition and
the subsequent estimation of the FODs at each voxel. Generating reliable FODs
from widely available clinical protocols with single-shell and
low-angular-resolution acquisitions remains challenging but could potentially
be addressed with recent advances in deep learning-based enhancement
techniques. Despite advancements, existing methods have predominantly been
assessed on healthy subjects, which have proved to be a major hurdle for their
clinical adoption. In this work, we validate a newly optimized enhancement
framework, FastFOD-Net, across healthy controls and six neurological disorders.
This accelerated end-to-end deep learning framework enhancing FODs with
superior performance and delivering training/inference efficiency for clinical
use ($60\times$ faster comparing to its predecessor). With the most
comprehensive clinical evaluation to date, our work demonstrates the potential
of FastFOD-Net in accelerating clinical neuroscience research, empowering
diffusion MRI analysis for disease differentiation, improving interpretability
in connectome applications, and reducing measurement errors to lower sample
size requirements. Critically, this work will facilitate the more widespread
adoption of, and build clinical trust in, deep learning based methods for
diffusion MRI enhancement. Specifically, FastFOD-Net enables robust analysis of
real-world, clinical diffusion MRI data, comparable to that achievable with
high-quality research acquisitions.

*Abhishek Kolari,Mohammadhossein Khojasteh,Yifan Jiang,Floris den Hengst,Filip Ilievski*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了ORBIT基准测试，用于评估视觉语言模型在物体属性推理上的能力，发现现有模型在复杂推理和真实图像上表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉问答基准测试在物体属性推理上存在局限性，缺乏对多层次推理和多样图像类别的代表性评估。

Method: 引入系统性评估框架，包含三种图像类型、三种推理复杂度和四种物体属性维度，构建ORBIT基准测试。

Result: 实验显示，12种先进视觉语言模型在零样本设置下表现显著低于人类，最高准确率仅40%。

Conclusion: ORBIT揭示了现有模型的不足，呼吁开发更可扩展的基准测试方法和更强的推理模型。

Abstract: While vision-language models (VLMs) have made remarkable progress on many
popular visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks, it remains unclear whether
they abstract and reason over depicted objects. Inspired by human object
categorisation, object property reasoning involves identifying and recognising
low-level details and higher-level abstractions. While current VQA benchmarks
consider a limited set of object property attributes like size, they typically
blend perception and reasoning, and lack representativeness in terms of
reasoning and image categories. To this end, we introduce a systematic
evaluation framework with images of three representative types, three reasoning
levels of increasing complexity, and four object property dimensions driven by
prior work on commonsense reasoning. We develop a procedure to instantiate this
benchmark into ORBIT, a multi-level reasoning VQA benchmark for object
properties comprising 360 images paired with a total of 1,080 count-based
questions. Experiments with 12 state-of-the-art VLMs in zero-shot settings
reveal significant limitations compared to humans, with the best-performing
model only reaching 40\% accuracy. VLMs struggle particularly with realistic
(photographic) images, counterfactual reasoning about physical and functional
properties, and higher counts. ORBIT points to the need to develop methods for
scalable benchmarking, generalize annotation guidelines, and explore additional
reasoning VLMs. We make the ORBIT benchmark and the experimental code available
to support such endeavors.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于高光谱成像（HSI）的方法，通过选择信息量最大的波段来减少视觉模糊性，从而提高对弱势道路使用者（VRU）的识别能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决因视觉模糊（如同色异谱现象）导致的弱势道路使用者识别困难问题，提升自动驾驶系统的安全性。

Method: 结合信息论技术（联合互信息最大化、相关性分析）和图像质量指标（对比信噪比），选择最具信息量的HSI波段，并重构伪彩色图像。

Result: 在H-City数据集上，选定的HSI波段（497 nm、607 nm、895 nm）显著提升了VRU与背景的区分度，各项指标（欧氏距离、SAM、T²、CIE ΔE）均有显著改善。

Conclusion: 该方法通过优化光谱输入，显著减少了同色异谱混淆，为高级驾驶辅助系统（ADAS）和自动驾驶（AD）提供了更可靠的感知基础，有助于提升道路安全。

Abstract: Protecting Vulnerable Road Users (VRU) is a critical safety challenge for
automotive perception systems, particularly under visual ambiguity caused by
metamerism, a phenomenon where distinct materials appear similar in RGB
imagery. This work investigates hyperspectral imaging (HSI) to overcome this
limitation by capturing unique material signatures beyond the visible spectrum,
especially in the Near-Infrared (NIR). To manage the inherent
high-dimensionality of HSI data, we propose a band selection strategy that
integrates information theory techniques (joint mutual information
maximization, correlation analysis) with a novel application of an image
quality metric (contrast signal-to-noise ratio) to identify the most spectrally
informative bands. Using the Hyperspectral City V2 (H-City) dataset, we
identify three informative bands (497 nm, 607 nm, and 895 nm, $\pm$27 nm) and
reconstruct pseudo-color images for comparison with co-registered RGB.
Quantitative results demonstrate increased dissimilarity and perceptual
separability of VRU from the background. The selected HSI bands yield
improvements of 70.24%, 528.46%, 1206.83%, and 246.62% for dissimilarity
(Euclidean, SAM, $T^2$) and perception (CIE $\Delta E$) metrics, consistently
outperforming RGB and confirming a marked reduction in metameric confusion. By
providing a spectrally optimized input, our method enhances VRU separability,
establishing a robust foundation for downstream perception tasks in Advanced
Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Autonomous Driving (AD), ultimately
contributing to improved road safety.

*Zixiang Yang,Yue Ma,Yinhan Zhang,Shanhui Mo,Dongrui Liu,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出EVCtrl，一种轻量级即插即用的控制适配器，通过时空双缓存策略减少冗余计算，提升生成效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如ControlNet虽能实现精确的时空控制，但增加了延迟和冗余计算，尤其在视频生成中。

Method: 提出时空双缓存策略：空间上分区处理控制信号，时间上选择性跳过不必要的去噪步骤。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证，EVCtrl显著提升速度（如2.16倍加速），且生成质量几乎无损。

Conclusion: EVCtrl无需重新训练模型，即可高效实现图像和视频的精确控制生成。

Abstract: Visual generation includes both image and video generation, training
probabilistic models to create coherent, diverse, and semantically faithful
content from scratch. While early research focused on unconditional sampling,
practitioners now demand controllable generation that allows precise
specification of layout, pose, motion, or style. While ControlNet grants
precise spatial-temporal control, its auxiliary branch markedly increases
latency and introduces redundant computation in both uncontrolled regions and
denoising steps, especially for video. To address this problem, we introduce
EVCtrl, a lightweight, plug-and-play control adapter that slashes overhead
without retraining the model. Specifically, we propose a spatio-temporal dual
caching strategy for sparse control information. For spatial redundancy, we
first profile how each layer of DiT-ControlNet responds to fine-grained
control, then partition the network into global and local functional zones. A
locality-aware cache focuses computation on the local zones that truly need the
control signal, skipping the bulk of redundant computation in global regions.
For temporal redundancy, we selectively omit unnecessary denoising steps to
improve efficiency. Extensive experiments on CogVideo-Controlnet,
Wan2.1-Controlnet, and Flux demonstrate that our method is effective in image
and video control generation without the need for training. For example, it
achieves 2.16 and 2.05 times speedups on CogVideo-Controlnet and
Wan2.1-Controlnet, respectively, with almost no degradation in generation
quality.Codes are available in the supplementary materials.

TL;DR: 研究评估了视觉语言模型（VLMs）在模拟低视力人群视觉感知方面的能力，发现结合视力信息和示例图像响应能显著提高模拟准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索VLMs在无障碍领域的模拟能力，填补低视力人群视觉感知模拟的研究空白。

Method: 通过调查40名低视力参与者构建基准数据集，生成VLM模拟代理，并评估其与参与者原始回答的一致性。

Result: VLMs在仅提供部分信息时模拟准确性较低（0.59），结合视力信息和示例图像响应后显著提高（0.70）。

Conclusion: VLMs在模拟低视力人群视觉感知时需要结合多模态信息，单一样例即可显著提升性能。

Abstract: Advances in vision language models (VLMs) have enabled the simulation of
general human behavior through their reasoning and problem solving
capabilities. However, prior research has not investigated such simulation
capabilities in the accessibility domain. In this paper, we evaluate the extent
to which VLMs can simulate the vision perception of low vision individuals when
interpreting images. We first compile a benchmark dataset through a survey
study with 40 low vision participants, collecting their brief and detailed
vision information and both open-ended and multiple-choice image perception and
recognition responses to up to 25 images. Using these responses, we construct
prompts for VLMs (GPT-4o) to create simulated agents of each participant,
varying the included information on vision information and example image
responses. We evaluate the agreement between VLM-generated responses and
participants' original answers. Our results indicate that VLMs tend to infer
beyond the specified vision ability when given minimal prompts, resulting in
low agreement (0.59). The agreement between the agent' and participants'
responses remains low when only either the vision information (0.59) or example
image responses (0.59) are provided, whereas a combination of both
significantly increase the agreement (0.70, p < 0.0001). Notably, a single
example combining both open-ended and multiple-choice responses, offers
significant performance improvements over either alone (p < 0.0001), while
additional examples provided minimal benefits (p > 0.05).

Motivation: 现有VLM应用缺乏开放数据集，限制了其在未直接训练任务中的适用性。

Result: 现有VLMs在零样本和少样本设置下表现良好，但需额外训练以适应实际工地场景。

Conclusion: 该数据集为研究人员提供了训练和评估新VLM架构的基准，推动建筑安全检查技术的发展。

Abstract: Construction safety inspections typically involve a human inspector
identifying safety concerns on-site. With the rise of powerful Vision Language
Models (VLMs), researchers are exploring their use for tasks such as detecting
safety rule violations from on-site images. However, there is a lack of open
datasets to comprehensively evaluate and further fine-tune VLMs in construction
safety inspection. Current applications of VLMs use small, supervised datasets,
limiting their applicability in tasks they are not directly trained for. In
this paper, we propose the ConstructionSite 10k, featuring 10,000 construction
site images with annotations for three inter-connected tasks, including image
captioning, safety rule violation visual question answering (VQA), and
construction element visual grounding. Our subsequent evaluation of current
state-of-the-art large pre-trained VLMs shows notable generalization abilities
in zero-shot and few-shot settings, while additional training is needed to make
them applicable to actual construction sites. This dataset allows researchers
to train and evaluate their own VLMs with new architectures and techniques,
providing a valuable benchmark for construction safety inspection.

Abstract: Document fraud poses a significant threat to industries reliant on secure and
verifiable documentation, necessitating robust detection mechanisms. This study
investigates the efficacy of state-of-the-art multi-modal large language models
(LLMs)-including OpenAI O1, OpenAI 4o, Gemini Flash (thinking), Deepseek Janus,
Grok, Llama 3.2 and 4, Qwen 2 and 2.5 VL, Mistral Pixtral, and Claude 3.5 and
3.7 Sonnet-in detecting fraudulent documents. We benchmark these models against
each other and prior work on document fraud detection techniques using a
standard dataset with real transactional documents. Through prompt optimization
and detailed analysis of the models' reasoning processes, we evaluate their
ability to identify subtle indicators of fraud, such as tampered text,
misaligned formatting, and inconsistent transactional sums. Our results reveal
that top-performing multi-modal LLMs demonstrate superior zero-shot
generalization, outperforming conventional methods on out-of-distribution
datasets, while several vision LLMs exhibit inconsistent or subpar performance.
Notably, model size and advanced reasoning capabilities show limited
correlation with detection accuracy, suggesting task-specific fine-tuning is
critical. This study underscores the potential of multi-modal LLMs in enhancing
document fraud detection systems and provides a foundation for future research
into interpretable and scalable fraud mitigation strategies.

TL;DR: MedSAMix是一种无需训练的方法，通过整合通用模型（如SAM）和专用模型（如MedSAM）的优势，提升医学图像分割的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学图像分割模型（如MedSAM）因数据有限、标注稀缺和分布偏移等问题，泛化能力受限。

Method: 提出一种零阶优化方法，自动发现最佳分层合并方案，并开发两种优化策略以适应不同临床需求。

Result: 在25个医学分割任务中，MedSAMix显著提升性能，专用任务和多任务评估分别提高6.67%和4.37%。

Conclusion: MedSAMix通过模型合并有效解决了医学图像分割中的泛化和领域适应问题。

Abstract: Universal medical image segmentation models have emerged as a promising
paradigm due to their strong generalizability across diverse tasks, showing
great potential for a wide range of clinical applications. This potential has
been partly driven by the success of general-purpose vision models such as the
Segment Anything Model (SAM), which has inspired the development of various
fine-tuned variants for medical segmentation tasks. However, fine-tuned
variants like MedSAM are trained on comparatively limited medical imaging data
that often suffers from heterogeneity, scarce annotations, and distributional
shifts. These challenges limit their ability to generalize across a wide range
of medical segmentation tasks. In this regard, we propose MedSAMix, a
training-free model merging method that integrates the strengths of both
generalist models (e.g., SAM) and specialist models (e.g., MedSAM) for medical
image segmentation. In contrast to traditional model merging approaches that
rely on manual configuration and often result in suboptimal outcomes, we
propose a zero-order optimization method to automatically discover optimal
layer-wise merging solutions. Furthermore, for clinical applications, we
develop two regimes to meet the demand of domain-specificity and
generalizability in different scenarios by single-task optimization and
multi-objective optimization respectively. Extensive evaluations on 25 medical
segmentation tasks demonstrate that MedSAMix effectively mitigates model bias
and consistently improves performance in both domain-specific accuracy and
generalization, achieving improvements of 6.67% on specialized tasks and 4.37%
on multi-task evaluations.

TL;DR: 研究利用AI分析腹部3D影像，发现2型糖尿病的腹部特征在不同体重人群中具有一致性，包括脂肪肌肉、内脏脂肪增多等。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管BMI是2型糖尿病的已知风险因素，但瘦人和肥胖者中糖尿病的分布差异表明，详细的身体组成可能揭示腹部表型。

Method: 通过AI从临床CT中提取腹部结构特征，使用随机森林和SHAP分析识别糖尿病风险和保护相关的身体组成特征。

Result: 随机森林模型的AUC为0.72-0.74，发现脂肪肌肉、内脏脂肪增多等是跨体重组的共同糖尿病特征。

Conclusion: 腹部特征可能是2型糖尿病的普遍驱动因素，与体重无关。

Abstract: Purpose: Although elevated BMI is a well-known risk factor for type 2
diabetes, the disease's presence in some lean adults and absence in others with
obesity suggests that detailed body composition may uncover abdominal
phenotypes of type 2 diabetes. With AI, we can now extract detailed
measurements of size, shape, and fat content from abdominal structures in 3D
clinical imaging at scale. This creates an opportunity to empirically define
body composition signatures linked to type 2 diabetes risk and protection using
large-scale clinical data. Approach: To uncover BMI-specific diabetic abdominal
patterns from clinical CT, we applied our design four times: once on the full
cohort (n = 1,728) and once on lean (n = 497), overweight (n = 611), and obese
(n = 620) subgroups separately. Briefly, our experimental design transforms
abdominal scans into collections of explainable measurements through
segmentation, classifies type 2 diabetes through a cross-validated random
forest, measures how features contribute to model-estimated risk or protection
through SHAP analysis, groups scans by shared model decision patterns
(clustering from SHAP) and links back to anatomical differences
(classification). Results: The random-forests achieved mean AUCs of 0.72-0.74.
There were shared type 2 diabetes signatures in each group; fatty skeletal
muscle, older age, greater visceral and subcutaneous fat, and a smaller or
fat-laden pancreas. Univariate logistic regression confirmed the direction of
14-18 of the top 20 predictors within each subgroup (p < 0.05). Conclusions:
Our findings suggest that abdominal drivers of type 2 diabetes may be
consistent across weight classes.

Result: 实验表明，HierOctFusion在形状质量和效率上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HierOctFusion通过分层和部分感知生成，显著提升了3D内容生成的性能。

Abstract: 3D content generation remains a fundamental yet challenging task due to the
inherent structural complexity of 3D data. While recent octree-based diffusion
models offer a promising balance between efficiency and quality through
hierarchical generation, they often overlook two key insights: 1) existing
methods typically model 3D objects as holistic entities, ignoring their
semantic part hierarchies and limiting generalization; and 2) holistic
high-resolution modeling is computationally expensive, whereas real-world
objects are inherently sparse and hierarchical, making them well-suited for
layered generation. Motivated by these observations, we propose HierOctFusion,
a part-aware multi-scale octree diffusion model that enhances hierarchical
feature interaction for generating fine-grained and sparse object structures.
Furthermore, we introduce a cross-attention conditioning mechanism that injects
part-level information into the generation process, enabling semantic features
to propagate effectively across hierarchical levels from parts to the whole.
Additionally, we construct a 3D dataset with part category annotations using a
pre-trained segmentation model to facilitate training and evaluation.
Experiments demonstrate that HierOctFusion achieves superior shape quality and
efficiency compared to prior methods.

lacking the capability to translate between hazy and haze-free images. To
address this issue, we propose a residual-based efficient bidirectional
diffusion model (RBDM) that can model the conditional distributions for both
dehazing and haze generation. Firstly, we devise dual Markov chains that can
effectively shift the residuals and facilitate bidirectional smooth transitions
between them. Secondly, the RBDM perturbs the hazy and haze-free images at
individual timesteps and predicts the noise in the perturbed data to
simultaneously learn the conditional distributions. Finally, to enhance
performance on relatively small datasets and reduce computational costs, our
method introduces a unified score function learned on image patches instead of
entire images. Our RBDM successfully implements size-agnostic bidirectional
transitions between haze-free and hazy images with only 15 sampling steps.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior or
at least comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic
and real-world datasets.

Result: 在两个真实数据集上验证，性能显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MICC算法有效且具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Existing rumor detection methods often neglect the content within images as
well as the inherent relationships between contexts and images across different
visual scales, thereby resulting in the loss of critical information pertinent
to rumor identification. To address these issues, this paper presents a novel
cross-modal rumor detection scheme based on contrastive learning, namely the
Multi-scale Image and Context Correlation exploration algorithm (MICC).
Specifically, we design an SCLIP encoder to generate unified semantic
embeddings for text and multi-scale image patches through contrastive
pretraining, enabling their relevance to be measured via dot-product
similarity. Building upon this, a Cross-Modal Multi-Scale Alignment module is
introduced to identify image regions most relevant to the textual semantics,
guided by mutual information maximization and the information bottleneck
principle, through a Top-K selection strategy based on a cross-modal relevance
matrix constructed between the text and multi-scale image patches. Moreover, a
scale-aware fusion network is designed to integrate the highly correlated
multi-scale image features with global text features by assigning adaptive
weights to image regions based on their semantic importance and cross-modal
relevance. The proposed methodology has been extensively evaluated on two
real-world datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that it achieves a
substantial performance improvement over existing state-of-the-art approaches
in rumor detection, highlighting its effectiveness and potential for practical
applications.

Abstract: LEARN is a layout-aware diffusion framework designed to generate
pedagogically aligned illustrations for STEM education. It leverages a curated
BookCover dataset that provides narrative layouts and structured visual cues,
enabling the model to depict abstract and sequential scientific concepts with
strong semantic alignment. Through layout-conditioned generation, contrastive
visual-semantic training, and prompt modulation, LEARN produces coherent visual
sequences that support mid-to-high-level reasoning in line with Bloom's
taxonomy while reducing extraneous cognitive load as emphasized by Cognitive
Load Theory. By fostering spatially organized and story-driven narratives, the
framework counters fragmented attention often induced by short-form media and
promotes sustained conceptual focus. Beyond static diagrams, LEARN demonstrates
potential for integration with multimodal systems and curriculum-linked
knowledge graphs to create adaptive, exploratory educational content. As the
first generative approach to unify layout-based storytelling, semantic
structure learning, and cognitive scaffolding, LEARN represents a novel
direction for generative AI in education. The code and dataset will be released
to facilitate future research and practical deployment.

Conclusion: EM-B3DM为半监督去雾提供了高效解决方案，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Existing dehazing methods deal with real-world haze images with difficulty,
especially scenes with thick haze. One of the main reasons is the lack of
real-world paired data and robust priors. To avoid the costly collection of
paired hazy and clear images, we propose an efficient semi-supervised image
dehazing method via Expectation-Maximization and Bidirectional Brownian Bridge
Diffusion Models (EM-B3DM) with a two-stage learning scheme. In the first
stage, we employ the EM algorithm to decouple the joint distribution of paired
hazy and clear images into two conditional distributions, which are then
modeled using a unified Brownian Bridge diffusion model to directly capture the
structural and content-related correlations between hazy and clear images. In
the second stage, we leverage the pre-trained model and large-scale unpaired
hazy and clear images to further improve the performance of image dehazing.
Additionally, we introduce a detail-enhanced Residual Difference Convolution
block (RDC) to capture gradient-level information, significantly enhancing the
model's representation capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
EM-B3DM achieves superior or at least comparable performance to
state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Result: 实验表明，VG-DETR在源自由远程感知检测任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: VG-DETR通过VFM和双级对齐有效提升伪标签质量和特征鲁棒性，为源自由目标检测提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation methods have been widely explored to bridge
domain gaps. However, in real-world remote-sensing scenarios, privacy and
transmission constraints often preclude access to source domain data, which
limits their practical applicability. Recently, Source-Free Object Detection
(SFOD) has emerged as a promising alternative, aiming at cross-domain
adaptation without relying on source data, primarily through a self-training
paradigm. Despite its potential, SFOD frequently suffers from training collapse
caused by noisy pseudo-labels, especially in remote sensing imagery with dense
objects and complex backgrounds. Considering that limited target domain
annotations are often feasible in practice, we propose a Vision
foundation-Guided DEtection TRansformer (VG-DETR), built upon a semi-supervised
framework for SFOD in remote sensing images. VG-DETR integrates a Vision
Foundation Model (VFM) into the training pipeline in a "free lunch" manner,
leveraging a small amount of labeled target data to mitigate pseudo-label noise
while improving the detector's feature-extraction capability. Specifically, we
introduce a VFM-guided pseudo-label mining strategy that leverages the VFM's
semantic priors to further assess the reliability of the generated
pseudo-labels. By recovering potentially correct predictions from
low-confidence outputs, our strategy improves pseudo-label quality and
quantity. In addition, a dual-level VFM-guided alignment method is proposed,
which aligns detector features with VFM embeddings at both the instance and
image levels. Through contrastive learning among fine-grained prototypes and
similarity matching between feature maps, this dual-level alignment further
enhances the robustness of feature representations against domain gaps.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that VG-DETR achieves superior performance in
source-free remote sensing detection tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在视频质量评估中存在结果不精确和损失计算效率低的问题，限制了模型对关键评估指标的关注。

Method: 采用整数标签（范围[10,50]）和目标掩码策略，仅暴露标签的前两位数计算损失，迫使模型学习数值评估的关键部分。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了模型在VQA任务中的准确性和一致性，在VQualA 2025挑战赛中排名第三。

Conclusion: 整数标签微调在优化视觉语言模型的定量评估场景中具有显著效果。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of vision language models(VLM), their ability to
assess visual content based on specific criteria and dimensions has become
increasingly critical for applications such as video-theme consistency
assessment and visual quality scoring. However, existing methods often suffer
from imprecise results and inefficient loss calculation, which limit the focus
of the model on key evaluation indicators. To address this, we propose
IOVQA(Integer-only VQA), a novel fine-tuning approach tailored for VLMs to
enhance their performance in video quality assessment tasks. The key innovation
of IOVQA lies in its label construction and its targeted loss calculation
mechanism. Specifically, during dataset curation, we constrain the model's
output to integers within the range of [10,50], ensuring numerical stability,
and convert decimal Overall_MOS to integer before using them as labels. We also
introduce a target-mask strategy: when computing the loss, only the first
two-digit-integer of the label is unmasked, forcing the model to learn the
critical components of the numerical evaluation. After fine-tuning the
Qwen2.5-VL model using the constructed dataset, experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the model's
accuracy and consistency in the VQA task, ranking 3rd in VQualA 2025
GenAI-Bench AIGC Video Quality Assessment Challenge -- Track I. Our work
highlights the effectiveness of merely leaving integer labels during
fine-tuning, providing an effective idea for optimizing VLMs in quantitative
evaluation scenarios.

Motivation: 现有CCD方法难以平衡新类别发现与分类任务，且容易累积错误并占用过多存储空间。

Method: IDOD包含三个模块：独立多样性模块（对比损失训练）、联合发现模块（单阶段新类别发现）和正交性模块（正交原型生成）。

Result: 在细粒度数据集上，IDOD优于现有方法。

Conclusion: IDOD有效解决了CCD中的矛盾问题，减少了错误累积和存储开销。

Abstract: Continuous category discovery (CCD) aims to automatically discover novel
categories in continuously arriving unlabeled data. This is a challenging
problem considering that there is no number of categories and labels in the
newly arrived data, while also needing to mitigate catastrophic forgetting.
Most CCD methods cannot handle the contradiction between novel class discovery
and classification well. They are also prone to accumulate errors in the
process of gradually discovering novel classes. Moreover, most of them use
knowledge distillation and data replay to prevent forgetting, occupying more
storage space. To address these limitations, we propose Independence-based
Diversity and Orthogonality-based Discrimination (IDOD). IDOD mainly includes
independent enrichment of diversity module, joint discovery of novelty module,
and continuous increment by orthogonality module. In independent enrichment,
the backbone is trained separately using contrastive loss to avoid it focusing
only on features for classification. Joint discovery transforms multi-stage
novel class discovery into single-stage, reducing error accumulation impact.
Continuous increment by orthogonality module generates mutually orthogonal
prototypes for classification and prevents forgetting with lower space overhead
via representative representation replay. Experimental results show that on
challenging fine-grained datasets, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为LatHAdapter的新型轻量级模块，用于改进预训练视觉语言模型在少样本分类任务中的微调。该方法通过利用下游数据的潜在语义层次结构，解决了现有适配器无法捕捉类别与图像样本之间一对多关联的问题。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有适配器方法在视觉和文本表示对齐时依赖显式空间邻近性，无法有效捕捉类别与图像样本之间的一对多关联，且难以处理未知类别。

Method: LatHAdapter引入可学习的‘属性’提示作为桥梁，将类别、属性和图像投影到双曲空间中，并通过层次正则化学习它们的潜在语义层次结构。

Result: 在四个少样本任务上的实验表明，LatHAdapter在已知类别的适应和未知类别的泛化上均优于其他微调方法。

Conclusion: LatHAdapter通过利用潜在语义层次结构，显著提升了少样本分类任务的性能。

Abstract: Adapter-based approaches have garnered attention for fine-tuning pre-trained
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on few-shot classification tasks. These methods
strive to develop a lightweight module that better aligns visual and (category)
textual representations, thereby enhancing performance on downstream few-shot
learning tasks. However, existing adapters generally learn/align (category)
textual-visual modalities via explicit spatial proximity in the underlying
embedding space, which i) fails to capture the inherent one-to-many
associations between categories and image samples and ii) struggles to
establish accurate associations between the unknown categories and images. To
address these issues, inspired by recent works on hyperbolic learning, we
develop a novel Latent Hierarchical Adapter (LatHAdapter) for fine-tuning VLMs
on downstream few-shot classification tasks. The core of LatHAdapter is to
exploit the latent semantic hierarchy of downstream training data and employ it
to provide richer, fine-grained guidance for the adapter learning process.
Specifically, LatHAdapter first introduces some learnable `attribute' prompts
as the bridge to align categories and images. Then, it projects the categories,
attribute prompts, and images within each batch in a hyperbolic space, and
employs hierarchical regularization to learn the latent semantic hierarchy of
them, thereby fully modeling the inherent one-to-many associations among
categories, learnable attributes, and image samples. Extensive experiments on
four challenging few-shot tasks show that the proposed LatHAdapter consistently
outperforms many other fine-tuning approaches, particularly in adapting known
classes and generalizing to unknown classes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频标记化方法在空间和时间维度上存在局限性，如固定网格标记导致低信息区域过度编码，以及缺乏对静态和动态内容的显式区分。

Method: GVT采用生成式2D高斯分布策略，通过STGE机制提取潜在刚性特征，并用GSP策略分离静态和动态内容。

Result: GVT在视频重建、动作识别和压缩任务中表现优异，优于基线方法MAGVIT-v2。

Conclusion: GVT通过空间自适应和时间分离策略，显著提升了视频标记化的通用性和性能。

Abstract: Video tokenization procedure is critical for a wide range of video processing
tasks. Most existing approaches directly transform video into fixed-grid and
patch-wise tokens, which exhibit limited versatility. Spatially, uniformly
allocating a fixed number of tokens often leads to over-encoding in
low-information regions. Temporally, reducing redundancy remains challenging
without explicitly distinguishing between static and dynamic content. In this
work, we propose the Gaussian Video Transformer (GVT), a versatile video
tokenizer built upon a generative 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) strategy. We
first extract latent rigid features from a video clip and represent them with a
set of 2D Gaussians generated by our proposed Spatio-Temporal Gaussian
Embedding (STGE) mechanism in a feed-forward manner. Such generative 2D
Gaussians not only enhance spatial adaptability by assigning higher (resp.,
lower) rendering weights to regions with higher (resp., lower) information
content during rasterization, but also improve generalization by avoiding
per-video optimization.To enhance the temporal versatility, we introduce a
Gaussian Set Partitioning (GSP) strategy that separates the 2D Gaussians into
static and dynamic sets, which explicitly model static content shared across
different time-steps and dynamic content specific to each time-step, enabling a
compact representation.We primarily evaluate GVT on the video reconstruction,
while also assessing its performance on action recognition and compression
using the UCF101, Kinetics, and DAVIS datasets. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that GVT achieves a state-of-the-art video reconstruction quality,
outperforms the baseline MAGVIT-v2 in action recognition, and delivers
comparable compression performance.

Conclusion: 结合不同深度估计方法能有效提升单目3D检测器在相机高度变化下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Monocular 3D object detectors, while effective on data from one ego camera
height, struggle with unseen or out-of-distribution camera heights. Existing
methods often rely on Plucker embeddings, image transformations or data
augmentation. This paper takes a step towards this understudied problem by
first investigating the impact of camera height variations on state-of-the-art
(SoTA) Mono3D models. With a systematic analysis on the extended CARLA dataset
with multiple camera heights, we observe that depth estimation is a primary
factor influencing performance under height variations. We mathematically prove
and also empirically observe consistent negative and positive trends in mean
depth error of regressed and ground-based depth models, respectively, under
camera height changes. To mitigate this, we propose Camera Height Robust
Monocular 3D Detector (CHARM3R), which averages both depth estimates within the
model. CHARM3R improves generalization to unseen camera heights by more than
$45\%$, achieving SoTA performance on the CARLA dataset. Codes and Models at

we propose a simple yet effective approach that transforms single-person

effort required for human-assisted data collection. Using this technique, we
build HowToDIV, a large-scale dataset containing 507 conversations, 6636
question-answer pairs and 24 hours of videoclips across diverse tasks in
cooking, mechanics, and planting. Each session includes multi-turn conversation
where an expert teaches a novice user how to perform a task step by step, while

Motivation: 通用视觉语言模型在无人机航拍图像上性能下降，因其高分辨率、复杂语义和实时性要求，限制了其在结构化航拍推理任务中的应用。

Method: 采用混合训练方法（监督微调+多阶段强化学习），利用GRPO算法提升结构化推理能力，并引入新数据集HRVQA-VL。

Conclusion: UAV-VL-R1通过优化训练方法和数据集，显著提升了航拍图像推理能力，同时满足实时性和资源限制需求。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong
generalization in natural image tasks. However, their performance often
degrades on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based aerial imagery, which features
high resolution, complex spatial semantics, and strict real-time constraints.
These challenges limit the applicability of general-purpose VLMs to structured
aerial reasoning tasks. To address these challenges, we propose UAV-VL-R1, a
lightweight VLM explicitly designed for aerial visual reasoning. It is trained
using a hybrid method that combines supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
multi-stage reinforcement learning (RL). We leverage the group relative policy
optimization (GRPO) algorithm to promote structured and interpretable reasoning
through rule-guided rewards and intra-group policy alignment. To support model
training and evaluation, we introduce a high-resolution visual question
answering dataset named HRVQA-VL, which consists of 50,019 annotated samples
covering eight UAV-relevant reasoning tasks, including object counting,
transportation recognition, and spatial scene inference. Experimental results
show that UAV-VL-R1 achieves a 48.17% higher zero-shot accuracy than the
Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct baseline and even outperforms its 72B-scale variant, which
is 36x larger, on multiple tasks. Ablation studies reveal that while SFT
improves semantic alignment, it may reduce reasoning diversity in mathematical
tasks. GRPO-based RL compensates for this limitation by enhancing logical
flexibility and the robustness of inference. Additionally, UAV-VL-R1 requires
only 3.9GB of memory under FP16 inference and can be quantized to 2.5GB with
INT8, supporting real-time deployment on resource-constrained UAV platforms.

Result: 在COCO和CrowdPose数据集上表现优异，尤其在复杂场景的CrowdPose上性能提升显著。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效提升了轻量级姿态估计的准确性和鲁棒性，尤其在复杂场景中表现突出。

Abstract: Human pose estimation has been widely applied in the human-centric
understanding and generation, but most existing state-of-the-art human pose
estimation methods require heavy computational resources for accurate
predictions. In order to obtain an accurate, robust yet lightweight human pose
estimator, one feasible way is to transfer pose knowledge from a powerful
teacher model to a less-parameterized student model by knowledge distillation.
However, the traditional knowledge distillation framework does not fully
explore the contextual information among human joints. Thus, in this paper, we
propose a novel coarse-to-fine two-stage knowledge distillation framework for
human pose estimation. In the first-stage distillation, we introduce the human
joints structure loss to mine the structural information among human joints so
as to transfer high-level semantic knowledge from the teacher model to the
student model. In the second-stage distillation, we utilize an Image-Guided
Progressive Graph Convolutional Network (IGP-GCN) to refine the initial human
pose obtained from the first-stage distillation and supervise the training of
the IGP-GCN in the progressive way by the final output pose of teacher model.
The extensive experiments on the benchmark dataset: COCO keypoint and CrowdPose
datasets, show that our proposed method performs favorably against lots of the
existing state-of-the-art human pose estimation methods, especially for the
more complex CrowdPose dataset, the performance improvement of our model is
more significant.

Motivation: 自动驾驶中行人重识别面临多模态输入不确定或缺失的挑战，传统方法难以应对，且预训练模型计算开销大。

Method: UMM框架结合多模态令牌映射器、合成模态增强策略和跨模态线索交互学习器，利用CLIP的视觉-语言对齐能力高效融合多模态输入。

Result: 实验表明，UMM在模态不确定条件下具有强鲁棒性、泛化能力和计算效率。

Conclusion: UMM为自动驾驶中的行人重识别提供了可扩展且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Re-Identification (ReID) is a critical technology in intelligent perception
systems, especially within autonomous driving, where onboard cameras must
identify pedestrians across views and time in real-time to support safe
navigation and trajectory prediction. However, the presence of uncertain or
missing input modalities--such as RGB, infrared, sketches, or textual
descriptions--poses significant challenges to conventional ReID approaches.
While large-scale pre-trained models offer strong multimodal semantic modeling
capabilities, their computational overhead limits practical deployment in
resource-constrained environments. To address these challenges, we propose a
lightweight Uncertainty Modal Modeling (UMM) framework, which integrates a
multimodal token mapper, synthetic modality augmentation strategy, and
cross-modal cue interactive learner. Together, these components enable unified
feature representation, mitigate the impact of missing modalities, and extract
complementary information across different data types. Additionally, UMM
leverages CLIP's vision-language alignment ability to fuse multimodal inputs
efficiently without extensive finetuning. Experimental results demonstrate that
UMM achieves strong robustness, generalization, and computational efficiency
under uncertain modality conditions, offering a scalable and practical solution
for pedestrian re-identification in autonomous driving scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advances in audio-driven portrait animation have demonstrated
impressive capabilities. However, existing methods struggle to align with
fine-grained human preferences across multiple dimensions, such as motion
naturalness, lip-sync accuracy, and visual quality. This is due to the
difficulty of optimizing among competing preference objectives, which often
conflict with one another, and the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality
datasets with multidimensional preference annotations. To address these, we
first introduce Talking-Critic, a multimodal reward model that learns
human-aligned reward functions to quantify how well generated videos satisfy
multidimensional expectations. Leveraging this model, we curate Talking-NSQ, a
large-scale multidimensional human preference dataset containing 410K
preference pairs. Finally, we propose Timestep-Layer adaptive multi-expert
Preference Optimization (TLPO), a novel framework for aligning diffusion-based
portrait animation models with fine-grained, multidimensional preferences. TLPO
decouples preferences into specialized expert modules, which are then fused
across timesteps and network layers, enabling comprehensive, fine-grained
enhancement across all dimensions without mutual interference. Experiments
demonstrate that Talking-Critic significantly outperforms existing methods in
aligning with human preference ratings. Meanwhile, TLPO achieves substantial
improvements over baseline models in lip-sync accuracy, motion naturalness, and
visual quality, exhibiting superior performance in both qualitative and
quantitative evaluations. Ours project page:

Abstract: Dense visual perception tasks have been constrained by their reliance on
predefined categories, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios
where visual concepts are unbounded. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like
CLIP have shown promise in open-vocabulary tasks, their direct application to
dense perception often leads to suboptimal performance due to limitations in
local feature representation. In this work, we present our observation that
CLIP's image tokens struggle to effectively aggregate information from
spatially or semantically related regions, resulting in features that lack
local discriminability and spatial consistency. To address this issue, we
propose DeCLIP, a novel framework that enhances CLIP by decoupling the
self-attention module to obtain ``content'' and ``context'' features
respectively. \revise{The context features are enhanced by jointly distilling
semantic correlations from Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) and object integrity
cues from diffusion models, thereby enhancing spatial consistency. In parallel,
the content features are aligned with image crop representations and
constrained by region correlations from VFMs to improve local discriminability.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeCLIP establishes a solid foundation
for open-vocabulary dense perception, consistently achieving state-of-the-art
performance across a broad spectrum of tasks, including 2D detection and
segmentation, 3D instance segmentation, video instance segmentation, and 6D
object pose estimation.} Code is available at

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型在职业和活动描述中存在性别关联，揭示了潜在的刻板印象，为模型偏见评估提供了新方法。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLM) align images and text in a shared representation
space that is useful for retrieval and zero-shot transfer. Yet, this alignment
can encode and amplify social stereotypes in subtle ways that are not obvious
from standard accuracy metrics. In this study, we test whether the contrastive
vision-language encoder exhibits gender-linked associations when it places
embeddings of face images near embeddings of short phrases that describe
occupations and activities. We assemble a dataset of 220 face photographs split
by perceived binary gender and a set of 150 unique statements distributed
across six categories covering emotional labor, cognitive labor, domestic
labor, technical labor, professional roles, and physical labor. We compute
unit-norm image embeddings for every face and unit-norm text embeddings for
every statement, then define a statement-level association score as the
difference between the mean cosine similarity to the male set and the mean
cosine similarity to the female set, where positive values indicate stronger
association with the male set and negative values indicate stronger association
with the female set. We attach bootstrap confidence intervals by resampling
images within each gender group, aggregate by category with a separate
bootstrap over statements, and run a label-swap null model that estimates the
level of mean absolute association we would expect if no gender structure were
present. The outcome is a statement-wise and category-wise map of gender
associations in a contrastive vision-language space, accompanied by
uncertainty, simple sanity checks, and a robust gender bias evaluation
framework.

Conclusion: 通过类别级几何学习和一致性对齐，有效提升了模型在未见环境中的泛化能力。

Abstract: Domain generalization in 3D segmentation is a critical challenge in deploying
models to unseen environments. Current methods mitigate the domain shift by
augmenting the data distribution of point clouds. However, the model learns
global geometric patterns in point clouds while ignoring the category-level
distribution and alignment. In this paper, a category-level geometry learning
framework is proposed to explore the domain-invariant geometric features for
domain generalized 3D semantic segmentation. Specifically, Category-level
Geometry Embedding (CGE) is proposed to perceive the fine-grained geometric
properties of point cloud features, which constructs the geometric properties
of each class and couples geometric embedding to semantic learning. Secondly,
Geometric Consistent Learning (GCL) is proposed to simulate the latent 3D
distribution and align the category-level geometric embeddings, allowing the
model to focus on the geometric invariant information to improve
generalization. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed
method, which has very competitive segmentation accuracy compared with the
state-of-the-art domain generalized point cloud methods.

Result: 在CIR基准测试中，PMTFR在监督CIR任务中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PMTFR通过简单有效的模块和训练免费优化，显著提升了CIR任务的性能，代码将公开。

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) presents a significant challenge as it
requires jointly understanding a reference image and a modified textual
instruction to find relevant target images. Some existing methods attempt to
use a two-stage approach to further refine retrieval results. However, this
often requires additional training of a ranking model. Despite the success of
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques in reducing training costs for language
models, their application in CIR tasks remains limited -- compressing visual
information into text or relying on elaborate prompt designs. Besides, existing
works only utilize it for zero-shot CIR, as it is challenging to achieve
satisfactory results in supervised CIR with a well-trained model. In this work,
we proposed a framework that includes the Pyramid Matching Model with
Training-Free Refinement (PMTFR) to address these challenges. Through a simple
but effective module called Pyramid Patcher, we enhanced the Pyramid Matching
Model's understanding of visual information at different granularities.
Inspired by representation engineering, we extracted representations from COT
data and injected them into the LVLMs. This approach allowed us to obtain
refined retrieval scores in the Training-Free Refinement paradigm without
relying on explicit textual reasoning, further enhancing performance. Extensive
experiments on CIR benchmarks demonstrate that PMTFR surpasses state-of-the-art
methods in supervised CIR tasks. The code will be made public.

Result: SAEs特征具有语义意义，提升泛化能力，并支持可控生成，揭示了跨模态共享表示。

Conclusion: SAEs在视觉模型中具有提升可解释性、泛化和可控性的潜力。

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a popular tool for interpreting
the hidden states of large language models (LLMs). By learning to reconstruct
activations from a sparse bottleneck layer, SAEs discover interpretable
features from the high-dimensional internal representations of LLMs. Despite
their popularity with language models, SAEs remain understudied in the visual
domain. In this work, we provide an extensive evaluation the representational
power of SAEs for vision models using a broad range of image-based tasks. Our
experimental results demonstrate that SAE features are semantically meaningful,
improve out-of-distribution generalization, and enable controllable generation
across three vision model architectures: vision embedding models, multi-modal
LMMs and diffusion models. In vision embedding models, we find that learned SAE
features can be used for OOD detection and provide evidence that they recover
the ontological structure of the underlying model. For diffusion models, we
demonstrate that SAEs enable semantic steering through text encoder
manipulation and develop an automated pipeline for discovering
human-interpretable attributes. Finally, we conduct exploratory experiments on
multi-modal LLMs, finding evidence that SAE features reveal shared
representations across vision and language modalities. Our study provides a
foundation for SAE evaluation in vision models, highlighting their strong
potential improving interpretability, generalization, and steerability in the
visual domain.

Conclusion: 该框架通过深度预测和时间细化，显著提升了单目内窥镜组织重建的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Accurate endoscope pose estimation and 3D tissue surface reconstruction
significantly enhances monocular minimally invasive surgical procedures by
enabling accurate navigation and improved spatial awareness. However, monocular
endoscope pose estimation and tissue reconstruction face persistent challenges,
including depth ambiguity, physiological tissue deformation, inconsistent
endoscope motion, limited texture fidelity, and a restricted field of view. To
overcome these limitations, a unified framework for monocular endoscopic tissue
reconstruction that integrates scale-aware depth prediction with
temporally-constrained perceptual refinement is presented. This framework
incorporates a novel MAPIS-Depth module, which leverages Depth Pro for robust
initialisation and Depth Anything for efficient per-frame depth prediction, in
conjunction with L-BFGS-B optimisation, to generate pseudo-metric depth
estimates. These estimates are temporally refined by computing pixel
correspondences using RAFT and adaptively blending flow-warped frames based on
LPIPS perceptual similarity, thereby reducing artefacts arising from
physiological tissue deformation and motion. To ensure accurate registration of
the synthesised pseudo-RGBD frames from MAPIS-Depth, a novel WEMA-RTDL module
is integrated, optimising both rotation and translation. Finally, truncated
signed distance function-based volumetric fusion and marching cubes are applied
to extract a comprehensive 3D surface mesh. Evaluations on HEVD and SCARED,
with ablation and comparative analyses, demonstrate the framework's robustness
and superiority over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: TimeMachine为精细年龄编辑提供了高效解决方案，同时解决了数据集不足的问题。

Abstract: With the advancement of generative models, facial image editing has made
significant progress. However, achieving fine-grained age editing while
preserving personal identity remains a challenging task.In this paper, we
propose TimeMachine, a novel diffusion-based framework that achieves accurate
age editing while keeping identity features unchanged. To enable fine-grained
age editing, we inject high-precision age information into the multi-cross
attention module, which explicitly separates age-related and identity-related
features. This design facilitates more accurate disentanglement of age
attributes, thereby allowing precise and controllable manipulation of facial
aging.Furthermore, we propose an Age Classifier Guidance (ACG) module that
predicts age directly in the latent space, instead of performing denoising
image reconstruction during training. By employing a lightweight module to
incorporate age constraints, this design enhances age editing accuracy by
modest increasing training cost. Additionally, to address the lack of
large-scale, high-quality facial age datasets, we construct a HFFA dataset
(High-quality Fine-grained Facial-Age dataset) which contains one million
high-resolution images labeled with identity and facial attributes.
Experimental results demonstrate that TimeMachine achieves state-of-the-art
performance in fine-grained age editing while preserving identity consistency.

Abstract: Pedestrian segmentation in automotive perception systems faces critical
safety challenges due to metamerism in RGB imaging, where pedestrians and
backgrounds appear visually indistinguishable.. This study investigates the
potential of hyperspectral imaging (HSI) for enhanced pedestrian segmentation
in urban driving scenarios using the Hyperspectral City v2 (H-City) dataset. We
compared standard RGB against two dimensionality-reduction approaches by
converting 128-channel HSI data into three-channel representations: Principal
Component Analysis (PCA) and optimal band selection using Contrast
Signal-to-Noise Ratio with Joint Mutual Information Maximization (CSNR-JMIM).
Three semantic segmentation models were evaluated: U-Net, DeepLabV3+, and
SegFormer. CSNR-JMIM consistently outperformed RGB with an average improvements
of 1.44% in Intersection over Union (IoU) and 2.18% in F1-score for pedestrian
segmentation. Rider segmentation showed similar gains with 1.43% IoU and 2.25%
F1-score improvements. These improved performance results from enhanced
spectral discrimination of optimally selected HSI bands effectively reducing
false positives. This study demonstrates robust pedestrian segmentation through
optimal HSI band selection, showing significant potential for safety-critical
automotive applications.

Conclusion: 去噪后检索范式可提升VMR性能，且易于集成到其他先进模型中。

Abstract: Current text-driven Video Moment Retrieval (VMR) methods encode all video
clips, including irrelevant ones, disrupting multimodal alignment and hindering
optimization. To this end, we propose a denoise-then-retrieve paradigm that
explicitly filters text-irrelevant clips from videos and then retrieves the
target moment using purified multimodal representations. Following this
paradigm, we introduce the Denoise-then-Retrieve Network (DRNet), comprising
Text-Conditioned Denoising (TCD) and Text-Reconstruction Feedback (TRF)
modules. TCD integrates cross-attention and structured state space blocks to
dynamically identify noisy clips and produce a noise mask to purify multimodal
video representations. TRF further distills a single query embedding from
purified video representations and aligns it with the text embedding, serving
as auxiliary supervision for denoising during training. Finally, we perform
conditional retrieval using text embeddings on purified video representations
for accurate VMR. Experiments on Charades-STA and QVHighlights demonstrate that
our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods on all metrics. Furthermore,
our denoise-then-retrieve paradigm is adaptable and can be seamlessly
integrated into advanced VMR models to boost performance.

Conclusion: DSC-Track通过空间线索一致性显著提升了3D多目标跟踪的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: 3D multi-object tracking is a critical and challenging task in the field of
autonomous driving. A common paradigm relies on modeling individual object
motion, e.g., Kalman filters, to predict trajectories. While effective in
simple scenarios, this approach often struggles in crowded environments or with
inaccurate detections, as it overlooks the rich geometric relationships between
objects. This highlights the need to leverage spatial cues. However, existing
geometry-aware methods can be susceptible to interference from irrelevant
objects, leading to ambiguous features and incorrect associations. To address
this, we propose focusing on cue-consistency: identifying and matching stable
spatial patterns over time. We introduce the Dynamic Scene Cue-Consistency
Tracker (DSC-Track) to implement this principle. Firstly, we design a unified
spatiotemporal encoder using Point Pair Features (PPF) to learn discriminative
trajectory embeddings while suppressing interference. Secondly, our
cue-consistency transformer module explicitly aligns consistent feature
representations between historical tracks and current detections. Finally, a
dynamic update mechanism preserves salient spatiotemporal information for
stable online tracking. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Waymo Open
Datasets validate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach. On the
nuScenes benchmark, for instance, our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance, reaching 73.2% and 70.3% AMOTA on the validation and test sets,
respectively.

Result: 实验证明NoOp能有效提升DC的分类性能。

Conclusion: NoOp通过优化噪声解决了DC的噪声不稳定性问题，显著提升了分类速度和性能。

Abstract: Although today's pretrained discriminative vision-language models (e.g.,
CLIP) have demonstrated strong perception abilities, such as zero-shot image
classification, they also suffer from the bag-of-words problem and spurious
bias. To mitigate these problems, some pioneering studies leverage powerful
generative models (e.g., pretrained diffusion models) to realize generalizable
image classification, dubbed Diffusion Classifier (DC). Specifically, by
randomly sampling a Gaussian noise, DC utilizes the differences of denoising
effects with different category conditions to classify categories.
Unfortunately, an inherent and notorious weakness of existing DCs is noise
instability: different random sampled noises lead to significant performance
changes. To achieve stable classification performance, existing DCs always
ensemble the results of hundreds of sampled noises, which significantly reduces
the classification speed. To this end, we firstly explore the role of noise in
DC, and conclude that: there are some ``good noises'' that can relieve the
instability. Meanwhile, we argue that these good noises should meet two
principles: Frequency Matching and Spatial Matching. Regarding both principles,
we propose a novel Noise Optimization method to learn matching (i.e., good)
noise for DCs: NoOp. For frequency matching, NoOp first optimizes a
dataset-specific noise: Given a dataset and a timestep t, optimize one randomly
initialized parameterized noise. For Spatial Matching, NoOp trains a
Meta-Network that adopts an image as input and outputs image-specific noise
offset. The sum of optimized noise and noise offset will be used in DC to
replace random noise. Extensive ablations on various datasets demonstrated the
effectiveness of NoOp.

Abstract: We introduce GANDiff FR, the first synthetic framework that precisely
controls demographic and environmental factors to measure, explain, and reduce
bias with reproducible rigor. GANDiff FR unifies StyleGAN3-based
identity-preserving generation with diffusion-based attribute control, enabling
fine-grained manipulation of pose around 30 degrees, illumination (four
directions), and expression (five levels) under ceteris paribus conditions. We
synthesize 10,000 demographically balanced faces across five cohorts validated
for realism via automated detection (98.2%) and human review (89%) to isolate
and quantify bias drivers. Benchmarking ArcFace, CosFace, and AdaFace under
matched operating points shows AdaFace reduces inter-group TPR disparity by 60%
(2.5% vs. 6.3%), with illumination accounting for 42% of residual bias.
Cross-dataset evaluation on RFW, BUPT, and CASIA WebFace confirms strong
synthetic-to-real transfer (r 0.85). Despite around 20% computational overhead
relative to pure GANs, GANDiff FR yields three times more attribute-conditioned

Motivation: 在增量目标检测中，基于Transformer的模型容易因知识蒸馏中的匈牙利匹配导致旧类别知识遗忘。

Method: 提出Index-Aligned Query Distillation (IAQD)，通过索引对齐的查询蒸馏，仅对关键查询进行蒸馏，避免干扰新类别学习。

Result: 实验表明，IAQD有效缓解知识遗忘，达到最新性能。

Conclusion: IAQD为基于Transformer的增量目标检测提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: Incremental object detection (IOD) aims to continuously expand the capability
of a model to detect novel categories while preserving its performance on
previously learned ones. When adopting a transformer-based detection model to
perform IOD, catastrophic knowledge forgetting may inevitably occur, meaning
the detection performance on previously learned categories may severely
degenerate. Previous typical methods mainly rely on knowledge distillation (KD)
to mitigate the catastrophic knowledge forgetting of transformer-based
detection models. Specifically, they utilize Hungarian Matching to build a
correspondence between the queries of the last-phase and current-phase
detection models and align the classifier and regressor outputs between matched
queries to avoid knowledge forgetting. However, we observe that in IOD task,
Hungarian Matching is not a good choice. With Hungarian Matching, the query of
the current-phase model may match different queries of the last-phase model at
different iterations during KD. As a result, the knowledge encoded in each
query may be reshaped towards new categories, leading to the forgetting of
previously encoded knowledge of old categories. Based on our observations, we
propose a new distillation approach named Index-Aligned Query Distillation
(IAQD) for transformer-based IOD. Beyond using Hungarian Matching, IAQD
establishes a correspondence between queries of the previous and current phase
models that have the same index. Moreover, we perform index-aligned
distillation only on partial queries which are critical for the detection of
previous categories. In this way, IAQD largely preserves the previous semantic
and spatial encoding capabilities without interfering with the learning of new
categories. Extensive experiments on representative benchmarks demonstrate that

Conclusion: 该方法有效降低了人力成本，为高效宫颈细胞分类开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Information on the number and category of cervical cells is crucial for the
diagnosis of cervical cancer. However, existing classification methods capable
of automatically measuring this information require the training dataset to be
representative, which consumes an expensive or even unaffordable human cost. We
herein propose active labeling that enables us to construct a representative
training dataset using a much smaller human cost for data-efficient cervical
cell classification. This cost-effective method efficiently leverages the
classifier's uncertainty on the unlabeled cervical cell images to accurately
select images that are most beneficial to label. With a fast estimation of the
uncertainty, this new algorithm exhibits its validity and effectiveness in
enhancing the representative ability of the constructed training dataset. The
extensive empirical results confirm its efficacy again in navigating the usage
of human cost, opening the avenue for data-efficient cervical cell
classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗攻击的目标标签选择方法依赖随机性、模型预测或静态语义资源，缺乏可解释性、可重复性或灵活性。

Conclusion: 预训练模型适合构建可解释、标准化和可扩展的对抗基准，适用于不同架构和数据集。

Abstract: In targeted adversarial attacks on vision models, the selection of the target
label is a critical yet often overlooked determinant of attack success. This
target label corresponds to the class that the attacker aims to force the model
to predict. Now, existing strategies typically rely on randomness, model
predictions, or static semantic resources, limiting interpretability,
reproducibility, or flexibility. This paper then proposes a semantics-guided
framework for adversarial target selection using the cross-modal knowledge
transfer from pretrained language and vision-language models. We evaluate
several state-of-the-art models (BERT, TinyLLAMA, and CLIP) as similarity
sources to select the most and least semantically related labels with respect
to the ground truth, forming best- and worst-case adversarial scenarios. Our
experiments on three vision models and five attack methods reveal that these
models consistently render practical adversarial targets and surpass static
lexical databases, such as WordNet, particularly for distant class
relationships. We also observe that static testing of target labels offers a
preliminary assessment of the effectiveness of similarity sources, \textit{a
priori} testing. Our results corroborate the suitability of pretrained models
for constructing interpretable, standardized, and scalable adversarial
benchmarks across architectures and datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开放词汇HOI检测方法过度依赖大语言模型，忽略了3D空间理解能力，HOID-R1旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 结合SFT赋予模型推理能力，GRPO利用多奖励信号优化策略，并引入MLLM监督机制减少幻觉。

Result: HOID-R1在HOI检测基准上达到最优性能，并在开放世界泛化中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HOID-R1通过结合CoT和GRPO，显著提升了HOI检测的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Understanding and recognizing human-object interaction (HOI) is a pivotal
application in AR/VR and robotics. Recent open-vocabulary HOI detection
approaches depend exclusively on large language models for richer textual
prompts, neglecting their inherent 3D spatial understanding capabilities. To
address this shortcoming, we introduce HOID-R1, the first HOI detection
framework that integrates chain-of-thought (CoT) guided supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) with group relative policy optimization (GRPO) within a reinforcement
learning (RL) paradigm. Specifically, we initially apply SFT to imbue the model
with essential reasoning capabilities, forcing the model to articulate its
thought process in the output. Subsequently, we integrate GRPO to leverage
multi-reward signals for policy optimization, thereby enhancing alignment
across diverse modalities. To mitigate hallucinations in the CoT reasoning, we
introduce an "MLLM-as-a-judge" mechanism that supervises the CoT outputs,
further improving generalization. Extensive experiments show that HOID-R1
achieves state-of-the-art performance on HOI detection benchmarks and
outperforms existing methods in open-world generalization to novel scenarios.

TL;DR: RETFound首次被用于视盘分割任务，表现优异，仅需少量任务特定样本即可超越现有最佳分割网络。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索RETFound在视盘分割任务中的应用潜力，验证其作为通用模型替代任务特定架构的可能性。

Method: 通过训练一个轻量级头部模块，利用RETFound作为基础模型进行视盘分割。

Result: 在多个公开和私有数据集上达到约96%的Dice分数，性能优于现有最佳方法。

Conclusion: RETFound在视盘分割任务中表现卓越，支持通用模型替代任务特定架构的潜力。

Abstract: RETFound is a well-known foundation model (FM) developed for fundus camera
and optical coherence tomography images. It has shown promising performance
across multiple datasets in diagnosing diseases, both eye-specific and
systemic, from retinal images. However, to our best knowledge, it has not been
used for other tasks. We present the first adaptation of RETFound for optic
disc segmentation, a ubiquitous and foundational task in retinal image
analysis. The resulting segmentation system outperforms state-of-the-art,
segmentation-specific baseline networks after training a head with only a very
modest number of task-specific examples. We report and discuss results with
four public datasets, IDRID, Drishti-GS, RIM-ONE-r3, and REFUGE, and a private
dataset, GoDARTS, achieving about 96% Dice consistently across all datasets.
Overall, our method obtains excellent performance in internal verification,
domain generalization and domain adaptation, and exceeds most of the
state-of-the-art baseline results. We discuss the results in the framework of
the debate about FMs as alternatives to task-specific architectures. The code

Motivation: 研究SRL在管状结构分割中的实际效果，验证其是否如原论文所述优于传统方法。

Result: SRL的性能未超越传统基线模型。

Conclusion: 拓扑保持损失函数存在局限性，为开发更有效的管状结构分割模型提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Image segmentation is an important and widely performed task in computer
vision. Accomplishing effective image segmentation in diverse settings often
requires custom model architectures and loss functions. A set of models that
specialize in segmenting thin tubular structures are topology
preservation-based loss functions. These models often utilize a pixel
skeletonization process claimed to generate more precise segmentation masks of
thin tubes and better capture the structures that other models often miss. One
such model, Skeleton Recall Loss (SRL) proposed by Kirchhoff et al.~\cite
{kirchhoff2024srl}, was stated to produce state-of-the-art results on benchmark
tubular datasets. In this work, we performed a theoretical analysis of the
gradients for the SRL loss. Upon comparing the performance of the proposed
method on some of the tubular datasets (used in the original work, along with
some additional datasets), we found that the performance of SRL-based
segmentation models did not exceed traditional baseline models. By providing
both a theoretical explanation and empirical evidence, this work critically
evaluates the limitations of topology-based loss functions, offering valuable
insights for researchers aiming to develop more effective segmentation models
for complex tubular structures.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通过奖励引导解码的方法来适应多模态大语言模型（MLLMs），以提升其视觉定位能力。该方法通过构建两个独立的奖励模型来控制对象精度和召回率，实现了对MLLM推理过程的动态控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着MLLMs的广泛应用，适应多样化用户需求变得尤为重要。本文旨在通过控制解码过程来提升MLLMs的视觉定位能力。

Method: 构建两个独立的奖励模型，分别控制对象精度和召回率，并通过奖励引导解码过程动态调整推理策略。

Result: 在标准对象幻觉基准测试中，该方法显著优于现有幻觉缓解方法，并提供了对MLLM推理过程的灵活控制。

Conclusion: 该方法为MLLMs的推理过程提供了动态控制能力，同时显著提升了视觉定位性能。

Abstract: As Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) gain widespread applicability, it
is becoming increasingly desirable to adapt them for diverse user needs. In
this paper, we study the adaptation of MLLMs through controlled decoding. To
achieve this, we introduce the first method for reward-guided decoding of MLLMs
and demonstrate its application in improving their visual grounding. Our method
involves building reward models for visual grounding and using them to guide
the MLLM's decoding process. Concretely, we build two separate reward models to
independently control the degree of object precision and recall in the model's
output. Our approach enables on-the-fly controllability of an MLLM's inference
process in two ways: first, by giving control over the relative importance of
each reward function during decoding, allowing a user to dynamically trade off
object precision for recall in image captioning tasks; second, by giving
control over the breadth of the search during decoding, allowing the user to
control the trade-off between the amount of test-time compute and the degree of
visual grounding. We evaluate our method on standard object hallucination
benchmarks, showing that it provides significant controllability over MLLM
inference, while consistently outperforming existing hallucination mitigation
methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合实例级嵌入蒸馏和关系型成对相似性蒸馏的统一知识蒸馏框架，显著提升了人脸识别模型在边缘设备上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统知识蒸馏方法在捕捉细粒度实例级细节和复杂关系结构方面表现不佳，导致性能不理想。

Method: 提出两种新型损失函数：实例级嵌入蒸馏（动态硬挖掘策略）和关系型成对相似性蒸馏（记忆库机制和样本挖掘策略）。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上优于现有蒸馏方法，学生模型甚至能超越教师模型的准确率。

Conclusion: 统一框架实现了实例级对齐和几何关系保留，为知识蒸馏提供了更全面的解决方案。

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation is crucial for optimizing face recognition models for
deployment in computationally limited settings, such as edge devices.
Traditional KD methods, such as Raw L2 Feature Distillation or Feature
Consistency loss, often fail to capture both fine-grained instance-level
details and complex relational structures, leading to suboptimal performance.
We propose a unified approach that integrates two novel loss functions,
Instance-Level Embedding Distillation and Relation-Based Pairwise Similarity
Distillation. Instance-Level Embedding Distillation focuses on aligning
individual feature embeddings by leveraging a dynamic hard mining strategy,
thereby enhancing learning from challenging examples. Relation-Based Pairwise
Similarity Distillation captures relational information through pairwise
similarity relationships, employing a memory bank mechanism and a sample mining
strategy. This unified framework ensures both effective instance-level
alignment and preservation of geometric relationships between samples, leading
to a more comprehensive distillation process. Our unified framework outperforms
state-of-the-art distillation methods across multiple benchmark face
recognition datasets, as demonstrated by extensive experimental evaluations.
Interestingly, when using strong teacher networks compared to the student, our
unified KD enables the student to even surpass the teacher's accuracy.

Method: 对CUT3R进行轻量级修改，为每种模态设计专用编码器，通过零卷积融合特征。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，显著提升了性能，并能灵活适应不同输入模态。

Conclusion: G-CUT3R有效利用先验信息，兼容性强，适用于多种3D重建任务。

Abstract: We introduce G-CUT3R, a novel feed-forward approach for guided 3D scene
reconstruction that enhances the CUT3R model by integrating prior information.
Unlike existing feed-forward methods that rely solely on input images, our
method leverages auxiliary data, such as depth, camera calibrations, or camera
positions, commonly available in real-world scenarios. We propose a lightweight
modification to CUT3R, incorporating a dedicated encoder for each modality to
extract features, which are fused with RGB image tokens via zero convolution.
This flexible design enables seamless integration of any combination of prior
information during inference. Evaluated across multiple benchmarks, including
3D reconstruction and other multi-view tasks, our approach demonstrates
significant performance improvements, showing its ability to effectively
utilize available priors while maintaining compatibility with varying input
modalities.

TL;DR: RMFAT是一种轻量级循环框架，用于高效恢复受大气湍流影响的视频，显著减少计算负担并提升实时性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大气湍流导致视频质量下降，现有方法计算成本高且难以实时部署，需更高效的解决方案。

Method: 采用轻量级循环框架，仅需两帧输入，结合多尺度特征编码和解码及时间扭曲模块。

Result: 在清晰度恢复（SSIM提升9%）和推理速度（运行时减少四倍）上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RMFAT适合实时大气湍流抑制任务，兼具高效性和性能优势。

Abstract: Atmospheric turbulence severely degrades video quality by introducing
distortions such as geometric warping, blur, and temporal flickering, posing
significant challenges to both visual clarity and temporal consistency. Current
state-of-the-art methods are based on transformer and 3D architectures and
require multi-frame input, but their large computational cost and memory usage
limit real-time deployment, especially in resource-constrained scenarios. In
this work, we propose RMFAT: Recurrent Multi-scale Feature Atmospheric
Turbulence Mitigator, designed for efficient and temporally consistent video
restoration under AT conditions. RMFAT adopts a lightweight recurrent framework
that restores each frame using only two inputs at a time, significantly
reducing temporal window size and computational burden. It further integrates
multi-scale feature encoding and decoding with temporal warping modules at both
encoder and decoder stages to enhance spatial detail and temporal coherence.
Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world atmospheric turbulence
datasets demonstrate that RMFAT not only outperforms existing methods in terms
of clarity restoration (with nearly a 9\% improvement in SSIM) but also
achieves significantly improved inference speed (more than a fourfold reduction
in runtime), making it particularly suitable for real-time atmospheric
turbulence suppression tasks.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have become the go-to method for biomedical instance
segmentation. Generalist models like Cellpose demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance across diverse cellular data, though their effectiveness often
degrades on domains that differ from their training data. While supervised
fine-tuning can address this limitation, it requires annotated data that may
not be readily available. We propose SelfAdapt, a method that enables the
adaptation of pre-trained cell segmentation models without the need for labels.
Our approach builds upon student-teacher augmentation consistency training,
introducing L2-SP regularization and label-free stopping criteria. We evaluate
our method on the LiveCell and TissueNet datasets, demonstrating relative
improvements in AP0.5 of up to 29.64% over baseline Cellpose. Additionally, we
show that our unsupervised adaptation can further improve models that were
previously fine-tuned with supervision. We release SelfAdapt as an easy-to-use
extension of the Cellpose framework. The code for our method is publicly

Motivation: 生物特征识别广泛应用，但模板隐私与安全是关键问题，尤其是基于同态加密的方案计算负担大。多模态融合能提升安全性，但需解决计算效率问题。

Method: 利用深度神经网络提取多模态（人脸、指纹、虹膜）特征，通过降维减少同态加密域的计算量，实验基于虚拟多生物特征数据库。

Result: 多模态特征融合可将模板尺寸减少67%，且性能（EER）与最佳单模态相当或更优。

Conclusion: 降维多模态特征融合在保持安全性和准确性的同时，显著提升了同态加密的计算效率。

Abstract: Biometric recognition is widely used, making the privacy and security of
extracted templates a critical concern. Biometric Template Protection schemes,
especially those utilizing Homomorphic Encryption, introduce significant
computational challenges due to increased workload. Recent advances in deep
neural networks have enabled state-of-the-art feature extraction for face,
fingerprint, and iris modalities. The ubiquity and affordability of biometric
sensors further facilitate multi-modal fusion, which can enhance security by
combining features from different modalities. This work investigates the
biometric performance of reduced multi-biometric template sizes. Experiments
are conducted on an in-house virtual multi-biometric database, derived from
DNN-extracted features for face, fingerprint, and iris, using the FRGC, MCYT,
and CASIA databases. The evaluated approaches are (i) explainable and
straightforward to implement under encryption, (ii) training-free, and (iii)
capable of generalization. Dimensionality reduction of feature vectors leads to
fewer operations in the Homomorphic Encryption (HE) domain, enabling more
efficient encrypted processing while maintaining biometric accuracy and
security at a level equivalent to or exceeding single-biometric recognition.
Our results demonstrate that, by fusing feature vectors from multiple
modalities, template size can be reduced by 67 % with no loss in Equal Error
Rate (EER) compared to the best-performing single modality.

Result: 在nuScenes和NAVSIM数据集上验证了ImagiDrive的鲁棒性和优越性。

Conclusion: ImagiDrive通过整合VLM和DWM，显著提升了自动驾驶的预测准确性和规划效率。

Abstract: Autonomous driving requires rich contextual comprehension and precise
predictive reasoning to navigate dynamic and complex environments safely.
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Driving World Models (DWMs) have
independently emerged as powerful recipes addressing different aspects of this
challenge. VLMs provide interpretability and robust action prediction through
their ability to understand multi-modal context, while DWMs excel in generating
detailed and plausible future driving scenarios essential for proactive
planning. Integrating VLMs with DWMs is an intuitive, promising, yet
understudied strategy to exploit the complementary strengths of accurate
behavioral prediction and realistic scene generation. Nevertheless, this
integration presents notable challenges, particularly in effectively connecting
action-level decisions with high-fidelity pixel-level predictions and
maintaining computational efficiency. In this paper, we propose ImagiDrive, a
novel end-to-end autonomous driving framework that integrates a VLM-based
driving agent with a DWM-based scene imaginer to form a unified
imagination-and-planning loop. The driving agent predicts initial driving
trajectories based on multi-modal inputs, guiding the scene imaginer to
generate corresponding future scenarios. These imagined scenarios are
subsequently utilized to iteratively refine the driving agent's planning
decisions. To address efficiency and predictive accuracy challenges inherent in
this integration, we introduce an early stopping mechanism and a trajectory
selection strategy. Extensive experimental validation on the nuScenes and
NAVSIM datasets demonstrates the robustness and superiority of ImagiDrive over
previous alternatives under both open-loop and closed-loop conditions.

Abstract: Understanding what semantic information persists after object removal is
critical for privacy-preserving 3D reconstruction and editable scene
representations. In this work, we introduce a novel benchmark and evaluation
framework to measure semantic residuals, the unintended semantic traces left
behind, after object removal in 3D Gaussian Splatting. We conduct experiments
across a diverse set of indoor and outdoor scenes, showing that current methods
can preserve semantic information despite the absence of visual geometry. We
also release Remove360, a dataset of pre/post-removal RGB images and
object-level masks captured in real-world environments. While prior datasets
have focused on isolated object instances, Remove360 covers a broader and more
complex range of indoor and outdoor scenes, enabling evaluation of object
removal in the context of full-scene representations. Given ground truth images
of a scene before and after object removal, we assess whether we can truly
eliminate semantic presence, and if downstream models can still infer what was
removed. Our findings reveal critical limitations in current 3D object removal
techniques and underscore the need for more robust solutions capable of
handling real-world complexity. The evaluation framework is available at
github.com/spatial-intelligence-ai/Remove360.git. Data are available at

Motivation: 现有MLLMs方法通常针对特定主题，需要大量数据微调，限制了其扩展性。MM-R1旨在通过统一框架实现高效个性化图像生成。

Method: MM-R1结合X-CoT推理策略，将个性化分为视觉推理和生成两步：1）通过用户提供的图像和上下文线索理解主题概念；2）基于提取的主题表征和用户提示生成个性化图像。采用GRPO优化生成对齐。

Conclusion: MM-R1通过跨模态推理和优化策略，为统一MLLMs的个性化图像生成提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with unified architectures excel
across a wide range of vision-language tasks, yet aligning them with
personalized image generation remains a significant challenge. Existing methods
for MLLMs are frequently subject-specific, demanding a data-intensive
fine-tuning process for every new subject, which limits their scalability. In
this paper, we introduce MM-R1, a framework that integrates a cross-modal
Chain-of-Thought (X-CoT) reasoning strategy to unlock the inherent potential of
unified MLLMs for personalized image generation. Specifically, we structure
personalization as an integrated visual reasoning and generation process: (1)
grounding subject concepts by interpreting and understanding user-provided
images and contextual cues, and (2) generating personalized images conditioned
on both the extracted subject representations and user prompts. To further
enhance the reasoning capability, we adopt Grouped Reward Proximal Policy
Optimization (GRPO) to explicitly align the generation. Experiments demonstrate
that MM-R1 unleashes the personalization capability of unified MLLMs to
generate images with high subject fidelity and strong text alignment in a
zero-shot manner.

Abstract: Indoor navigation is a difficult task, as it generally comes with poor GPS
access, forcing solutions to rely on other sources of information. While
significant progress continues to be made in this area, deployment to
production applications is still lacking, given the complexity and additional
requirements of current solutions. Here, we introduce an efficient, real-time
and easily deployable deep learning approach, based on visual input only, that
can predict the direction towards a target from images captured by a mobile
device. Our technical approach, based on a novel graph-based path generation
method, combined with explainable data augmentation and curriculum learning,
includes contributions that make the process of data collection, annotation and
training, as automatic as possible, efficient and robust. On the practical
side, we introduce a novel largescale dataset, with video footage inside a
relatively large shopping mall, in which each frame is annotated with the
correct next direction towards different specific target destinations.
Different from current methods, ours relies solely on vision, avoiding the need
of special sensors, additional markers placed along the path, knowledge of the
scene map or internet access. We also created an easy to use application for
Android, which we plan to make publicly available. We make all our data and
code available along with visual demos on our project site

TL;DR: CoFi是一种从粗到细的少样本分割方法，用于电子显微镜图像中的肾小球基底膜分割，减少标注负担并提高效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督深度学习方法需要大量标注，临床实用性低；少样本学习难以捕捉精细结构。

Method: CoFi先用三张标注图像训练轻量网络生成粗分割掩码，再通过形态学修剪生成高质量点提示，指导SAM细化分割。

Result: Dice系数74.54%，推理速度1.9 FPS，显著减轻标注和计算负担。

Conclusion: CoFi高效准确，适合研究和临床应用，代码已开源。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) in electron
microscopy (EM) images is fundamental for quantifying membrane thickness and
supporting the diagnosis of various kidney diseases. While supervised deep
learning approaches achieve high segmentation accuracy, their reliance on
extensive pixel-level annotation renders them impractical for clinical
workflows. Few-shot learning can reduce this annotation burden but often
struggles to capture the fine structural details necessary for GBM analysis. In
this study, we introduce CoFi, a fast and efficient coarse-to-fine few-shot
segmentation pipeline designed for GBM delineation in EM images. CoFi first
trains a lightweight neural network using only three annotated images to
produce an initial coarse segmentation mask. This mask is then automatically
processed to generate high-quality point prompts with morphology-aware pruning,
which are subsequently used to guide SAM in refining the segmentation. The
proposed method achieved exceptional GBM segmentation performance, with a Dice
coefficient of 74.54% and an inference speed of 1.9 FPS. We demonstrate that
CoFi not only alleviates the annotation and computational burdens associated
with conventional methods, but also achieves accurate and reliable segmentation
results. The pipeline's speed and annotation efficiency make it well-suited for
research and hold strong potential for clinical applications in renal
pathology. The pipeline is publicly available at:

Conclusion: TACR-YOLO为特殊场景下的异常行为检测提供了新思路，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Abnormal Human Behavior Detection (AHBD) under special scenarios is becoming
increasingly crucial. While YOLO-based detection methods excel in real-time
tasks, they remain hindered by challenges including small objects, task
conflicts, and multi-scale fusion in AHBD. To tackle them, we propose
TACR-YOLO, a new real-time framework for AHBD. We introduce a Coordinate
Attention Module to enhance small object detection, a Task-Aware Attention
Module to deal with classification-regression conflicts, and a Strengthen Neck
Network for refined multi-scale fusion, respectively. In addition, we optimize
Anchor Box sizes using K-means clustering and deploy DIoU-Loss to improve
bounding box regression. The Personnel Anomalous Behavior Detection (PABD)
dataset, which includes 8,529 samples across four behavior categories, is also
presented. Extensive experimental results indicate that TACR-YOLO achieves
91.92% mAP on PABD, with competitive speed and robustness. Ablation studies
highlight the contribution of each improvement. This work provides new insights
for abnormal behavior detection under special scenarios, advancing its
progress.

Abstract: The construction industry increasingly relies on visual data to support
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) applications for site
monitoring. High-quality, domain-specific datasets, comprising images, videos,
and point clouds, capture site geometry and spatiotemporal dynamics, including
the location and interaction of objects, workers, and materials. However,
despite growing interest in leveraging visual datasets, existing resources vary
widely in sizes, data modalities, annotation quality, and representativeness of
real-world construction conditions. A systematic review to categorize their
data characteristics and application contexts is still lacking, limiting the
community's ability to fully understand the dataset landscape, identify
critical gaps, and guide future directions toward more effective, reliable, and
scalable AI applications in construction. To address this gap, this study
conducts an extensive search of academic databases and open-data platforms,
yielding 51 publicly available visual datasets that span the 2005-2024 period.
These datasets are categorized using a structured data schema covering (i) data
fundamentals (e.g., size and license), (ii) data modalities (e.g., RGB and
point cloud), (iii) annotation frameworks (e.g., bounding boxes), and (iv)
downstream application domains (e.g., progress tracking). This study
synthesizes these findings into an open-source catalog, OpenConstruction,
supporting data-driven method development. Furthermore, the study discusses
several critical limitations in the existing construction dataset landscape and
presents a roadmap for future data infrastructure anchored in the Findability,
Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability (FAIR) principles. By
reviewing the current landscape and outlining strategic priorities, this study
supports the advancement of data-centric solutions in the construction sector.

Motivation: 尽管视频合成技术取得显著进展，但多镜头视频生成的研究仍处于初级阶段，现有方法在镜头过渡上表现不稳定。

Method: 构建Cine250K数据集，分析视频扩散模型的注意力映射，设计掩码控制机制，并在训练中应用。

Result: CineTrans能生成高质量的多镜头视频，显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: CineTrans通过创新的控制和评估方法，为多镜头视频生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in video synthesis, research into multi-shot
video generation remains in its infancy. Even with scaled-up models and massive
datasets, the shot transition capabilities remain rudimentary and unstable,
largely confining generated videos to single-shot sequences. In this work, we
introduce CineTrans, a novel framework for generating coherent multi-shot
videos with cinematic, film-style transitions. To facilitate insights into the
film editing style, we construct a multi-shot video-text dataset Cine250K with
detailed shot annotations. Furthermore, our analysis of existing video
diffusion models uncovers a correspondence between attention maps in the
diffusion model and shot boundaries, which we leverage to design a mask-based
control mechanism that enables transitions at arbitrary positions and transfers
effectively in a training-free setting. After fine-tuning on our dataset with
the mask mechanism, CineTrans produces cinematic multi-shot sequences while
adhering to the film editing style, avoiding unstable transitions or naive
concatenations. Finally, we propose specialized evaluation metrics for
transition control, temporal consistency and overall quality, and demonstrate
through extensive experiments that CineTrans significantly outperforms existing
baselines across all criteria.

Abstract: Detailed data is required to quantify energy conservation measures in
buildings, such as envelop retrofits, without compromising cultural heritage.
Novel artificial intelligence tools may improve efficiency in identifying
heritage values in buildings compared to costly and time-consuming traditional

various aspects of cultural heritage value in fa\c{c}ade images. Using this
data and building register data as features, machine learning models were
trained to classify multi-family and non-residential buildings in Stockholm,
Sweden. Validation against an expert-created inventory shows a macro F1-score
of 0.71 using a combination of register data and features retrieved from GPT,
and a score of 0.60 using only GPT-derived data. The presented methodology can

efficiency measures and integrated consideration of heritage value in
large-scale energetic refurbishment scenarios.

Result: 在NAVSIM和Bench2Drive数据集上，VeteranAD实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: VeteranAD通过感知与规划的紧密耦合，显著提升了自动驾驶的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has achieved remarkable advancements in recent
years. Existing methods primarily follow a perception-planning paradigm, where
perception and planning are executed sequentially within a fully differentiable
framework for planning-oriented optimization. We further advance this paradigm
through a perception-in-plan framework design, which integrates perception into
the planning process. This design facilitates targeted perception guided by
evolving planning objectives over time, ultimately enhancing planning
performance. Building on this insight, we introduce VeteranAD, a coupled
perception and planning framework for end-to-end autonomous driving. By
incorporating multi-mode anchored trajectories as planning priors, the
perception module is specifically designed to gather traffic elements along
these trajectories, enabling comprehensive and targeted perception. Planning
trajectories are then generated based on both the perception results and the
planning priors. To make perception fully serve planning, we adopt an
autoregressive strategy that progressively predicts future trajectories while
focusing on relevant regions for targeted perception at each step. With this
simple yet effective design, VeteranAD fully unleashes the potential of
planning-oriented end-to-end methods, leading to more accurate and reliable
driving behavior. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM and Bench2Drive datasets
demonstrate that our VeteranAD achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: CNN在视觉识别任务中表现优异，但其依赖规则网格结构限制了其对复杂拓扑关系和非局部语义的建模能力。

Method: HGFE构建了两层互补的图结构：局部空间依赖的窗口内图卷积和全局语义关系的窗口间超节点交互，并引入自适应频率调制模块平衡信号传播。

Result: 在多个数据集（CIFAR-100、PASCAL VOC、VisDrone等）上的实验验证了HGFE在结构表示和识别性能上的有效性。

Conclusion: HGFE是一种轻量级、端到端可训练的模块，可无缝集成到标准CNN中，显著提升了视觉任务的性能。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have
  demonstrated strong performance in visual recognition tasks,
  but their inherent reliance on regular grid structures limits
  their capacity to model complex topological relationships and
  non-local semantics within images. To address this limita tion, we propose
the hierarchical graph feature enhancement
  (HGFE), a novel framework that integrates graph-based rea soning into CNNs to
enhance both structural awareness and
  feature representation. HGFE builds two complementary levels
  of graph structures: intra-window graph convolution to cap ture local spatial
dependencies and inter-window supernode
  interactions to model global semantic relationships. Moreover,
  we introduce an adaptive frequency modulation module that
  dynamically balances low-frequency and high-frequency signal
  propagation, preserving critical edge and texture information
  while mitigating over-smoothing. The proposed HGFE module
  is lightweight, end-to-end trainable, and can be seamlessly
  integrated into standard CNN backbone networks. Extensive
  experiments on CIFAR-100 (classification), PASCAL VOC,
  and VisDrone (detection), as well as CrackSeg and CarParts
  (segmentation), validated the effectiveness of the HGFE in
  improving structural representation and enhancing overall
  recognition performance.

Abstract: Historical handwritten text recognition (HTR) is essential for unlocking the
cultural and scholarly value of archival documents, yet digitization is often
hindered by scarce transcriptions, linguistic variation, and highly diverse
handwriting styles. In this study, we apply TrOCR, a state-of-the-art

Rudolf Gwalther. We investigate targeted image preprocessing and a broad suite
of data augmentation techniques, introducing four novel augmentation methods
designed specifically for historical handwriting characteristics. We also
evaluate ensemble learning approaches to leverage the complementary strengths
of augmentation-trained models. On the Gwalther dataset, our best single-model
augmentation (Elastic) achieves a Character Error Rate (CER) of 1.86, while a
top-5 voting ensemble achieves a CER of 1.60 - representing a 50% relative
improvement over the best reported TrOCR_BASE result and a 42% improvement over
the previous state of the art. These results highlight the impact of
domain-specific augmentations and ensemble strategies in advancing HTR
performance for historical manuscripts.

Result: 在多个数据集上验证，AIM显著提升可解释性（EPG分数）和准确性。

Conclusion: AIM能有效促进真实特征的使用，提升泛化能力和可解释性。

Abstract: It has been observed that deep neural networks (DNNs) often use both genuine
as well as spurious features. In this work, we propose "Amending Inherent
Interpretability via Self-Supervised Masking" (AIM), a simple yet interestingly
effective method that promotes the network's utilization of genuine features
over spurious alternatives without requiring additional annotations. In
particular, AIM uses features at multiple encoding stages to guide a
self-supervised, sample-specific feature-masking process. As a result, AIM
enables the training of well-performing and inherently interpretable models
that faithfully summarize the decision process. We validate AIM across a
diverse range of challenging datasets that test both out-of-distribution
generalization and fine-grained visual understanding. These include
general-purpose classification benchmarks such as ImageNet100, HardImageNet,
and ImageWoof, as well as fine-grained classification datasets such as
Waterbirds, TravelingBirds, and CUB-200. AIM demonstrates significant dual
benefits: interpretability improvements, as measured by the Energy Pointing
Game (EPG) score, and accuracy gains over strong baselines. These consistent
gains across domains and architectures provide compelling evidence that AIM
promotes the use of genuine and meaningful features that directly contribute to
improved generalization and human-aligned interpretability.

Abstract: Accelerated aging of transportation infrastructure in the rapidly developing
Yangtze River Delta region necessitates efficient concrete crack detection, as
crack deterioration critically compromises structural integrity and regional
economic growth. To overcome the limitations of inefficient manual inspection
and the suboptimal performance of existing deep learning models, particularly
for small-target crack detection within complex backgrounds, this paper
proposes YOLOv11-KW-TA-FP, a multi-task concrete crack detection and
segmentation model based on the YOLOv11n architecture. The proposed model
integrates a three-stage optimization framework: (1) Embedding dynamic
KernelWarehouse convolution (KWConv) within the backbone network to enhance
feature representation through a dynamic kernel sharing mechanism; (2)
Incorporating a triple attention mechanism (TA) into the feature pyramid to
strengthen channel-spatial interaction modeling; and (3) Designing an FP-IoU
loss function to facilitate adaptive bounding box regression penalization.
Experimental validation demonstrates that the enhanced model achieves
significant performance improvements over the baseline, attaining 91.3%
precision, 76.6% recall, and 86.4% mAP@50. Ablation studies confirm the
synergistic efficacy of the proposed modules. Furthermore, robustness tests
indicate stable performance under conditions of data scarcity and noise
interference. This research delivers an efficient computer vision solution for
automated infrastructure inspection, exhibiting substantial practical
engineering value.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高效跟踪器通常因降低计算复杂度和模型参数而牺牲特征表示能力，限制了其在复杂环境中的准确性。

Method: MST采用MSG生成多状态特征，SSE对其进行增强，CSI模块实现状态间交互和特征整合，设计轻量化的HSA-SSD模块。

Result: MST在多个数据集上优于现有高效跟踪器，提升了跟踪精度和鲁棒性，计算开销仅0.1 GFLOPs和0.66 M参数。

Conclusion: MST通过轻量化设计显著提升了跟踪性能，尤其在复杂环境中表现优异。

Abstract: Efficient trackers achieve faster runtime by reducing computational
complexity and model parameters. However, this efficiency often compromises the
expense of weakened feature representation capacity, thus limiting their
ability to accurately capture target states using single-layer features. To
overcome this limitation, we propose Multi-State Tracker (MST), which utilizes
highly lightweight state-specific enhancement (SSE) to perform specialized
enhancement on multi-state features produced by multi-state generation (MSG)
and aggregates them in an interactive and adaptive manner using cross-state
interaction (CSI). This design greatly enhances feature representation while
incurring minimal computational overhead, leading to improved tracking
robustness in complex environments. Specifically, the MSG generates multiple
state representations at multiple stages during feature extraction, while SSE
refines them to highlight target-specific features. The CSI module facilitates
information exchange between these states and ensures the integration of
complementary features. Notably, the introduced SSE and CSI modules adopt a
highly lightweight hidden state adaptation-based state space duality (HSA-SSD)
design, incurring only 0.1 GFLOPs in computation and 0.66 M in parameters.
Experimental results demonstrate that MST outperforms all previous efficient
trackers across multiple datasets, significantly improving tracking accuracy
and robustness. In particular, it shows excellent runtime performance, with an
AO score improvement of 4.5\% over the previous SOTA efficient tracker HCAT on
the GOT-10K dataset. The code is available at https://github.com/wsumel/MST.

Abstract: Intelligent analysis of medical imaging plays a crucial role in assisting
clinical diagnosis. However, achieving efficient and high-accuracy image
classification in resource-constrained computational environments remains
challenging. This study proposes a medical image classification method based on
an improved ConvNeXt-Tiny architecture. Through structural optimization and
loss function design, the proposed method enhances feature extraction
capability and classification performance while reducing computational
complexity. Specifically, the method introduces a dual global pooling (Global
Average Pooling and Global Max Pooling) feature fusion strategy into the
ConvNeXt-Tiny backbone to simultaneously preserve global statistical features
and salient response information. A lightweight channel attention module,
termed Squeeze-and-Excitation Vector (SEVector), is designed to improve the
adaptive allocation of channel weights while minimizing parameter overhead.
Additionally, a Feature Smoothing Loss is incorporated into the loss function
to enhance intra-class feature consistency and suppress intra-class variance.
Under CPU-only conditions (8 threads), the method achieves a maximum
classification accuracy of 89.10% on the test set within 10 training epochs,
exhibiting a stable convergence trend in loss values. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method effectively improves medical image
classification performance in resource-limited settings, providing a feasible
and efficient solution for the deployment and promotion of medical imaging
analysis models.

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现最佳，显著超越现有方法（如ReVOS和ReasonVOS）。

Conclusion: Veason-R1通过结构化推理和高效探索，实现了高性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Video reasoning segmentation (VRS) endeavors to delineate referred objects in
videos guided by implicit instructions that encapsulate human intent and
temporal logic. Previous approaches leverage large vision language models
(LVLMs) to encode object semantics into <SEG> tokens for mask prediction.
However, this paradigm suffers from limited interpretability during inference
and suboptimal performance due to inadequate spatiotemporal reasoning. Drawing
inspiration from seminal breakthroughs in reinforcement learning, we introduce
Veason-R1, a specialized LVLM for VRS that emphasizes structured reasoning in
segmentation. Veason-R1 is trained through Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) augmented with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) initialization. To begin with, we
curate high-quality CoT training data to instill structured reasoning
trajectories, bridging video-level semantics and frame-level spatial grounding,
yielding the supervised fine-tuned model Veason-SFT. Subsequently, GRPO
fine-tuning encourages efficient exploration of the reasoning space by
optimizing reasoning chains. To this end, we incorporate a holistic reward
mechanism that synergistically enhances spatial alignment and temporal
consistency, bolstering keyframe localization and fine-grained grounding.
Comprehensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that Veason-R1 achieves
state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, surpassing prior art by
significant margins (e.g., +1.3 J &F in ReVOS and +10.0 J &F in ReasonVOS),
while exhibiting robustness to hallucinations (+8.8 R). Our code and model
weights will be available at Veason-R1.

Motivation: 工业异常检测中数据稀缺问题突出，现有异常生成方法缺乏逼真性或需额外训练数据。

Result: 在MVTec AD和VisA数据集上验证了AAG的有效性，生成的异常图像提升了下游检测任务性能。

Conclusion: AAG为工业异常检测提供了一种高效、无需训练的异常生成解决方案。

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection (AD) plays a significant role in manufacturing
where a long-standing challenge is data scarcity. A growing body of works have
emerged to address insufficient anomaly data via anomaly generation. However,
these anomaly generation methods suffer from lack of fidelity or need to be
trained with extra data. To this end, we propose a training-free anomaly
generation framework dubbed AAG, which is based on Stable Diffusion (SD)'s
strong generation ability for effective anomaly image generation. Given a
normal image, mask and a simple text prompt, AAG can generate realistic and
natural anomalies in the specific regions and simultaneously keep contents in
other regions unchanged. In particular, we propose Cross-Attention Enhancement
(CAE) to re-engineer the cross-attention mechanism within Stable Diffusion
based on the given mask. CAE increases the similarity between visual tokens in
specific regions and text embeddings, which guides these generated visual
tokens in accordance with the text description. Besides, generated anomalies
need to be more natural and plausible with object in given image. We propose
Self-Attention Enhancement (SAE) which improves similarity between each normal
visual token and anomaly visual tokens. SAE ensures that generated anomalies

TL;DR: TrajSV是一个基于轨迹的框架，解决了体育分析中的数据不可用、缺乏有效轨迹框架和标签不足的问题，通过三个模块和对比损失优化，在多个体育视频任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决体育分析中数据不可用、缺乏有效轨迹框架和标签不足的问题。

Method: 提出TrajSV框架，包括数据预处理、CRNet和VRNet模块，使用轨迹增强Transformer和编码器-解码器架构，引入三重对比损失进行无监督优化。

Result: 在足球、篮球和排球视频数据集上，TrajSV在检索、动作识别和视频字幕任务中表现优异，检索性能提升近70%，动作识别在17类中9类领先，字幕性能提升近20%。

Conclusion: TrajSV在体育视频分析中表现出色，解决了现有问题，并提供了实际部署系统。

Abstract: Sports analytics has received significant attention from both academia and
industry in recent years. Despite the growing interest and efforts in this
field, several issues remain unresolved, including (1) data unavailability, (2)
lack of an effective trajectory-based framework, and (3) requirement for
sufficient supervision labels. In this paper, we present TrajSV, a
trajectory-based framework that addresses various issues in existing studies.
TrajSV comprises three components: data preprocessing, Clip Representation
Network (CRNet), and Video Representation Network (VRNet). The data
preprocessing module extracts player and ball trajectories from sports
broadcast videos. CRNet utilizes a trajectory-enhanced Transformer module to
learn clip representations based on these trajectories. Additionally, VRNet
learns video representations by aggregating clip representations and visual
features with an encoder-decoder architecture. Finally, a triple contrastive
loss is introduced to optimize both video and clip representations in an
unsupervised manner. The experiments are conducted on three broadcast video
datasets to verify the effectiveness of TrajSV for three types of sports (i.e.,
soccer, basketball, and volleyball) with three downstream applications (i.e.,
sports video retrieval, action spotting, and video captioning). The results
demonstrate that TrajSV achieves state-of-the-art performance in sports video
retrieval, showcasing a nearly 70% improvement. It outperforms baselines in
action spotting, achieving state-of-the-art results in 9 out of 17 action
categories, and demonstrates a nearly 20% improvement in video captioning.
Additionally, we introduce a deployed system along with the three applications
based on TrajSV.

*Yumeng Shi,Quanyu Long,Yin Wu,Wenya Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现，视频语言模型中位置编码对时间理解影响有限，而帧顺序反转会显著降低性能。时间信息通过帧间注意力逐步合成，最终整合到查询令牌中。基于此，提出了两种效率优化策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索视频语言模型中时间理解的机制，特别是位置编码的作用，以改进模型性能。

Method: 通过分析实验揭示时间信息整合路径，提出跨模态注意力分阶段和早期令牌截断的时间退出机制。

Result: 实验验证了两种策略的有效性，揭示了时间推理源于视觉令牌间的因果注意力交互。

Conclusion: 首次系统研究视频语言模型的时间理解机制，为未来模型优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Video language models (VideoLMs) have made significant progress in multimodal
understanding. However, temporal understanding, which involves identifying
event order, duration, and relationships across time, still remains a core
challenge. Prior works emphasize positional encodings (PEs) as a key mechanism
for encoding temporal structure. Surprisingly, we find that removing or
modifying PEs in video inputs yields minimal degradation in the performance of
temporal understanding. In contrast, reversing the frame sequence while
preserving the original PEs causes a substantial drop. To explain this
behavior, we conduct substantial analysis experiments to trace how temporal
information is integrated within the model. We uncover a causal information
pathway: temporal cues are progressively synthesized through inter-frame
attention, aggregated in the final frame, and subsequently integrated into the
query tokens. This emergent mechanism shows that temporal reasoning emerges
from inter-visual token interactions under the constraints of causal attention,
which implicitly encodes temporal structure. Based on these insights, we
propose two efficiency-oriented strategies: staged cross-modal attention and a
temporal exit mechanism for early token truncation. Experiments on two
benchmarks validate the effectiveness of both approaches. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work to systematically investigate video temporal
understanding in VideoLMs, offering insights for future model improvement.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种低成本、可重复的框架，利用车载摄像头视频数据实时评估和定位路边植被及基础设施。方法结合单目深度估计、深度误差校正和几何三角测量，生成精确的空间和结构数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统遥感方法（如LiDAR）成本高且不适用于实时监测。本研究旨在利用普通车载摄像头数据，提供一种快速、实时且经济的解决方案，适用于城市植被和基础设施的监测。

Method: 开发了一个端到端流程，包括单目深度估计、基于梯度提升回归的深度校正，以及基于GPS的三角测量和针孔相机几何的高度计算。

Result: 深度校正模型表现优异（R2=0.92，MAE=0.31），低速车辆内部摄像头精度最高（平均定位误差2.83米，高度估计误差树木2.09米，杆0.88米）。

Conclusion: 该框架首次结合单目深度建模、GPS三角定位和实时结构评估，为城市植被和基础设施监测提供了一种低成本、高效的解决方案，适用于公用事业公司和城市规划者。

Abstract: Our study introduces a novel, low-cost, and reproducible framework for
real-time, object-level structural assessment and geolocation of roadside
vegetation and infrastructure with commonly available but underutilized
dashboard camera (dashcam) video data. We developed an end-to-end pipeline that
combines monocular depth estimation, depth error correction, and geometric
triangulation to generate accurate spatial and structural data from
street-level video streams from vehicle-mounted dashcams. Depth maps were first
estimated using a state-of-the-art monocular depth model, then refined via a
gradient-boosted regression framework to correct underestimations, particularly
for distant objects. The depth correction model achieved strong predictive
performance (R2 = 0.92, MAE = 0.31 on transformed scale), significantly
reducing bias beyond 15 m. Further, object locations were estimated using
GPS-based triangulation, while object heights were calculated using pin hole
camera geometry. Our method was evaluated under varying conditions of camera
placement and vehicle speed. Low-speed vehicle with inside camera gave the
highest accuracy, with mean geolocation error of 2.83 m, and mean absolute
error (MAE) in height estimation of 2.09 m for trees and 0.88 m for poles. To
the best of our knowledge, it is the first framework to combine monocular depth
modeling, triangulated GPS-based geolocation, and real-time structural
assessment for urban vegetation and infrastructure using consumer-grade video
data. Our approach complements conventional RS methods, such as LiDAR and image
by offering a fast, real-time, and cost-effective solution for object-level
monitoring of vegetation risks and infrastructure exposure, making it
especially valuable for utility companies, and urban planners aiming for
scalable and frequent assessments in dynamic urban environments.

TL;DR: CoreEditor提出了一种基于文本驱动的3D编辑框架，通过引入对应约束注意力机制和语义相似性，解决了多视图一致性问题，并提供了选择性编辑功能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在文本驱动的3D编辑中难以保持多视图一致性，导致编辑效果不足和细节模糊。

Method: CoreEditor采用对应约束注意力机制，结合几何对齐和语义相似性，实现多视图一致性编辑，并提供选择性编辑管道。

Result: 实验表明，CoreEditor能生成高质量、3D一致的编辑结果，细节更清晰，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CoreEditor通过创新的注意力机制和语义建模，有效解决了多视图一致性问题，提升了文本驱动的3D编辑效果。

Abstract: Text-driven 3D editing seeks to modify 3D scenes according to textual
descriptions, and most existing approaches tackle this by adapting pre-trained
2D image editors to multi-view inputs. However, without explicit control over
multi-view information exchange, they often fail to maintain cross-view
consistency, leading to insufficient edits and blurry details. We introduce
CoreEditor, a novel framework for consistent text-to-3D editing. The key
innovation is a correspondence-constrained attention mechanism that enforces
precise interactions between pixels expected to remain consistent throughout
the diffusion denoising process. Beyond relying solely on geometric alignment,
we further incorporate semantic similarity estimated during denoising, enabling
more reliable correspondence modeling and robust multi-view editing. In
addition, we design a selective editing pipeline that allows users to choose
preferred results from multiple candidates, offering greater flexibility and
user control. Extensive experiments show that CoreEditor produces high-quality,
3D-consistent edits with sharper details, significantly outperforming prior
methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LoRAtorio是一种无需训练的多LoRA组合框架，通过利用模型内在行为解决现有方法在开放环境中组合多个LoRA适配器的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多LoRA组合时表现不佳，尤其是在开放环境中无法预知所需技能的数量和性质。

Method: 在潜在空间中划分空间块，计算每个块预测噪声与基础模型的余弦相似度，构建空间感知权重矩阵，加权聚合LoRA输出，并改进分类器自由引导以解决领域漂移。

Result: LoRAtorio在ClipScore上提升1.3%，在GPT-4V评估中胜率72.43%，且适用于多种潜在扩散模型。

Conclusion: LoRAtorio在多LoRA组合中表现优异，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become a widely adopted technique in
text-to-image diffusion models, enabling the personalisation of visual concepts
such as characters, styles, and objects. However, existing approaches struggle
to effectively compose multiple LoRA adapters, particularly in open-ended
settings where the number and nature of required skills are not known in
advance. In this work, we present LoRAtorio, a novel train-free framework for
multi-LoRA composition that leverages intrinsic model behaviour. Our method is
motivated by two key observations: (1) LoRA adapters trained on narrow domains
produce denoised outputs that diverge from the base model, and (2) when
operating out-of-distribution, LoRA outputs show behaviour closer to the base
model than when conditioned in distribution. The balance between these two
observations allows for exceptional performance in the single LoRA scenario,
which nevertheless deteriorates when multiple LoRAs are loaded. Our method
operates in the latent space by dividing it into spatial patches and computing
cosine similarity between each patch's predicted noise and that of the base
model. These similarities are used to construct a spatially-aware weight
matrix, which guides a weighted aggregation of LoRA outputs. To address domain
drift, we further propose a modification to classifier-free guidance that
incorporates the base model's unconditional score into the composition. We
extend this formulation to a dynamic module selection setting, enabling
inference-time selection of relevant LoRA adapters from a large pool. LoRAtorio
achieves state-of-the-art performance, showing up to a 1.3% improvement in
ClipScore and a 72.43% win rate in GPT-4V pairwise evaluations, and generalises
effectively to multiple latent diffusion models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索通用大语言模型（如GPT-5）在乳腺X光片视觉问答任务中的潜力，以支持乳腺癌筛查。

Method: 在四个公开乳腺X光片数据集（EMBED、InBreast、CMMD、CBIS-DDSM）上评估GPT-5和GPT-4o，涵盖BI-RADS评估、异常检测和恶性分类任务。

Result: GPT-5在各项任务中表现最佳，但敏感性和特异性低于人类专家。例如，在EMBED数据集上，恶性分类准确率为52.8%。

Conclusion: GPT-5在乳腺X光片任务中展现出潜力，但仍需领域适应和优化才能用于高风险的临床应用。

Abstract: Mammogram visual question answering (VQA) integrates image interpretation
with clinical reasoning and has potential to support breast cancer screening.
We systematically evaluated the GPT-5 family and GPT-4o model on four public
mammography datasets (EMBED, InBreast, CMMD, CBIS-DDSM) for BI-RADS assessment,
abnormality detection, and malignancy classification tasks. GPT-5 consistently
was the best performing model but lagged behind both human experts and
domain-specific fine-tuned models. On EMBED, GPT-5 achieved the highest scores
among GPT variants in density (56.8%), distortion (52.5%), mass (64.5%),
calcification (63.5%), and malignancy (52.8%) classification. On InBreast, it
attained 36.9% BI-RADS accuracy, 45.9% abnormality detection, and 35.0%
malignancy classification. On CMMD, GPT-5 reached 32.3% abnormality detection
and 55.0% malignancy accuracy. On CBIS-DDSM, it achieved 69.3% BI-RADS
accuracy, 66.0% abnormality detection, and 58.2% malignancy accuracy. Compared
with human expert estimations, GPT-5 exhibited lower sensitivity (63.5%) and
specificity (52.3%). While GPT-5 exhibits promising capabilities for screening
tasks, its performance remains insufficient for high-stakes clinical imaging
applications without targeted domain adaptation and optimization. However, the
tremendous improvements in performance from GPT-4o to GPT-5 show a promising
trend in the potential for general large language models (LLMs) to assist with
mammography VQA tasks.

TL;DR: Thyme是一种新型多模态大语言模型（MLLM）范式，通过生成和执行代码实现图像处理和计算操作，超越现有“图像思维”方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开源模型在图像处理和逻辑推理能力上不如专有模型（O3），Thyme旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用两阶段训练策略：初始SFT训练代码生成，随后RL阶段优化决策，并提出GRPO-ATS算法平衡推理与代码执行。

Result: 在20个基准测试中表现优异，尤其在复杂推理和高分辨率感知任务中。

Conclusion: Thyme通过代码生成与执行显著提升了MLLM的性能，为多模态推理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Following OpenAI's introduction of the ``thinking with images'' concept,
recent efforts have explored stimulating the use of visual information in the
reasoning process to enhance model performance in perception and reasoning
tasks. However, to the best of our knowledge, no open-source work currently
offers a feature set as rich as proprietary models (O3), which can perform
diverse image manipulations and simultaneously enhance logical reasoning
capabilities through code. In this paper, we make a preliminary attempt in this
direction by introducing Thyme (Think Beyond Images), a novel paradigm for
enabling MLLMs to transcend existing ``think with images'' approaches by
autonomously generating and executing diverse image processing and
computational operations via executable code. This approach not only
facilitates a rich, on-the-fly set of image manipulations (e.g., cropping,
rotation, contrast enhancement) but also allows for mathematical computations,
all while maintaining high autonomy in deciding when and how to apply these
operations. We activate this capability through a two-stage training strategy:
an initial SFT on a curated dataset of 500K samples to teach code generation,
followed by a RL phase to refine decision-making. For the RL stage, we manually
collect and design high-resolution question-answer pairs to increase the
learning difficulty, and we propose GRPO-ATS (Group Relative Policy
Optimization with Adaptive Temperature Sampling), an algorithm that applies
distinct temperatures to text and code generation to balance reasoning
exploration with code execution precision. We conduct extensive experimental
analysis and ablation studies. Comprehensive evaluations on nearly 20
benchmarks show that Thyme yields significant and consistent performance gains,
particularly in challenging high-resolution perception and complex reasoning
tasks.

Result: 在Open-ML-CC18数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于其他权重分配方法。

Conclusion: 通过合作博弈多准则决策，能够更全面地利用分类器信息，提升集成学习性能。

Abstract: Since the Fourth Industrial Revolution, AI technology has been widely used in
many fields, but there are several limitations that need to be overcome,
including overfitting/underfitting, class imbalance, and the limitations of
representation (hypothesis space) due to the characteristics of different
models. As a method to overcome these problems, ensemble, commonly known as
model combining, is being extensively used in the field of machine learning.
Among ensemble learning methods, voting ensembles have been studied with
various weighting methods, showing performance improvements. However, the
existing methods that reflect the pre-information of classifiers in weights
consider only one evaluation criterion, which limits the reflection of various
information that should be considered in a model realistically. Therefore, this
paper proposes a method of making decisions considering various information
through cooperative games in multi-criteria situations. Using this method,
various types of information known beforehand in classifiers can be
simultaneously considered and reflected, leading to appropriate weight
distribution and performance improvement. The machine learning algorithms were
applied to the Open-ML-CC18 dataset and compared with existing ensemble
weighting methods. The experimental results showed superior performance
compared to other weighting methods.

Conclusion: Apriel-Nemotron-15B-Thinker在性能和效率上取得了显著平衡。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable reasoning

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗领域的数据共享受伦理、社会和制度限制，传统集中式学习难以实现，且数据分布变化大，现有持续学习方法多针对自然图像，医疗领域研究不足。

Method: 采用统一的提示池和最小扩展策略，通过冻结部分提示减少计算开销，并引入新的正则化项平衡知识保留与适应。

Result: 在三个糖尿病视网膜病变数据集上，分类准确率提升至少10%，F1分数提高9分，同时降低推理成本。

Conclusion: PCL方法有望推动可持续医疗AI发展，支持实时诊断、患者监测和远程医疗应用。

Abstract: Modern AI models achieve state-of-the-art performance with large-scale,
high-quality datasets; however, ethical, social, and institutional constraints
in the medical domain severely restrict data sharing, rendering centralized
learning nearly impossible. Each institution must incrementally update models
using only local data. Traditional training overfits new samples and suffers
from catastrophic forgetting, losing previously acquired knowledge. Medical
data distributions also shift due to varying diagnostic equipment and
demographics. Although continual learning (CL) has advanced, most methods
address natural images, leaving medical-domain-specific CL underexplored. We
propose a prompt-based continual learning (PCL) approach featuring a unified
prompt pool with a minimal expansion strategy: by expanding and freezing a
subset of prompts, our method reduces computational overhead, and a novel
regularization term balances retention and adaptation. Experiments on three
diabetic retinopathy datasets Aptos2019, LI2019, and Diabetic Retinopathy
Detection show our model improves final classification accuracy by at least 10%
and F1-score by 9 points over state-of-the-art approaches while lowering
inference cost. We anticipate this study will drive sustainable medical AI
advances, enabling real-time diagnosis, patient monitoring, and telemedicine
applications in distributed healthcare. Code will be released upon acceptance

Conclusion: Retro-Expert不仅性能优越，还通过可解释性弥合AI预测与化学洞察之间的差距。

Abstract: Retrosynthesis prediction aims to infer the reactant molecule based on a
given product molecule, which is a fundamental task in chemical synthesis.
However, existing models rely on static pattern-matching paradigm, which limits
their ability to perform effective logic decision-making, leading to black-box
decision-making. Building on this, we propose Retro-Expert, an interpretable
retrosynthesis framework that performs collaborative reasoning by combining the
complementary reasoning strengths of Large Language Models and specialized
models via reinforcement learning. It outputs natural language explanations
grounded in chemical logic through three components: (1) specialized models
perform shallow reasoning to construct high-quality chemical decision space,
(2) LLM-driven critical reasoning to generate predictions and corresponding
interpretable reasoning path, and (3) reinforcement learning optimizing
interpretable decision policy. Experiments show that Retro-Expert not only
surpasses both LLM-based and specialized models across different metrics but
also provides expert-aligned explanations that bridge the gap between AI
predictions and actionable chemical insights.

Motivation: 解决大规模语言模型预训练中数据量扩展带来的收益递减问题，探索合成数据作为性能提升的新范式。

Method: 提出BeyondWeb框架，生成高质量合成数据，并通过14项基准测试评估其性能。

Result: BeyondWeb在性能上优于Cosmopedia和Nemotron-Synth，训练速度更快，且小模型表现优于大模型。

Conclusion: 高质量合成数据需多因素联合优化，BeyondWeb展示了其潜力，但需科学方法和实践经验支持。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language model (LLM) pretraining have shown that
simply scaling data quantity eventually leads to diminishing returns, hitting a
data wall. In response, the use of synthetic data for pretraining has emerged
as a promising paradigm for pushing the frontier of performance. Despite this,
the factors affecting synthetic data quality remain poorly understood. In this
work, we introduce BeyondWeb, a synthetic data generation framework that
produces high-quality synthetic data for pretraining. BeyondWeb significantly
extends the capabilities of traditional web-scale datasets, outperforming
state-of-the-art synthetic pretraining datasets such as Cosmopedia and
Nemotron-CC's high-quality synthetic subset (Nemotron-Synth) by up to 5.1
percentage points (pp) and 2.6pp, respectively, when averaged across a suite of
14 benchmark evaluations. It delivers up to 7.7x faster training than open web
data and 2.7x faster than Nemotron-Synth. Remarkably, a 3B model trained for
180B tokens on BeyondWeb outperforms an 8B model trained for the same token
budget on Cosmopedia. We also present several insights from BeyondWeb on
synthetic data for pretraining: what drives its benefits, which data to
rephrase and how, and the impact of model size and family on data quality.
Overall, our work shows that there's no silver bullet for generating
high-quality synthetic pretraining data. The best outcomes require jointly
optimizing many factors, a challenging task that requires rigorous science and
practical expertise. Naive approaches can yield modest improvements,
potentially at great cost, while well-executed methods can yield transformative
improvements, as exemplified by BeyondWeb.

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个模型选择框架M&C，帮助用户高效选择预训练的文本到图像（T2I）模型，而无需对所有模型进行微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公共预训练T2I模型促进了模型的民主化，但用户面临如何选择最适合目标数据域的模型的挑战。

Method: M&C框架基于匹配图，包含模型和数据集节点，以及模型-数据和数据-数据边，通过图嵌入特征预测最佳微调模型。

Result: 在10个T2I模型和32个数据集上的实验表明，M&C在61.3%的情况下成功预测最佳模型，其余情况下也能选择接近最优的模型。

Conclusion: M&C为预训练T2I模型的选择提供了一种高效且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models based on diffusion and transformer architectures
advance rapidly. They are often pretrained on large corpora, and openly shared
on a model platform, such as HuggingFace. Users can then build up AI
applications, e.g., generating media contents, by adopting pretrained T2I
models and fine-tuning them on the target dataset. While public pretrained T2I
models facilitate the democratization of the models, users face a new
challenge: which model can be best fine-tuned based on the target data domain?
Model selection is well addressed in classification tasks, but little is known
in (pretrained) T2I models and their performance indication on the target
domain. In this paper, we propose the first model selection framework, M&C,
which enables users to efficiently choose a pretrained T2I model from a model
platform without exhaustively fine-tuning them all on the target dataset. The
core of M&C is a matching graph, which consists of: (i) nodes of available
models and profiled datasets, and (ii) edges of model-data and data-data pairs
capturing the fine-tuning performance and data similarity, respectively. We
then build a model that, based on the inputs of model/data feature, and,
critically, the graph embedding feature, extracted from the matching graph,
predicts the model achieving the best quality after fine-tuning for the target
domain. We evaluate M&C on choosing across ten T2I models for 32 datasets
against three baselines. Our results show that M&C successfully predicts the
best model for fine-tuning in 61.3% of the cases and a closely performing model
for the rest.

TL;DR: CURE框架通过两阶段方法解决RLVR中熵崩溃问题，提升LLM的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RLVR方法因静态初始状态采样导致熵崩溃，限制了模型多样性和性能提升。

Method: CURE采用两阶段框架：第一阶段通过高熵关键令牌引导探索，第二阶段通过DAPO加强利用。

Result: 在数学推理任务中，CURE性能提升5%，同时保持高熵水平。

Conclusion: CURE在熵和准确性上均达到最优，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning with Verified Reward (RLVR) have
driven the emergence of more sophisticated cognitive behaviors in large
language models (LLMs), thereby enhancing their reasoning capabilities.
However, in prior RLVR pipelines, the repeated use of static initial-state
sampling drawn exactly from the dataset distribution during each sampling phase
produced overly deterministic, low diversity model behavior, which manifested
as rapid entropy collapse and hindered sustained performance gains during
prolonged training. To address this issue, we introduce CURE
(Critical-token-gUided Re concatenation for Entropy-collapse prevention), a
two-stage framework that balances exploration and exploitation. Specifically,
in the first stage, to deliberately steer the model toward novel yet coherent
contexts, we re-generate at high-entropy critical tokens and jointly optimize
the original and the branched trajectories. The further comparison with vanilla
DAPO shows that the regeneration process achieves a better performance on math
reasoning tasks while sustaining a high-level entropy degree for exploration.
In the second stage, we continue training with static initial-state sampling by
DAPO, intentionally placing the model in a familiar state to gradually
strengthen exploitation. Extensive experiments on Qwen-2.5-Math-7B show that,
compared to other RLVR methods, CURE achieves a 5% performance gain across six
math benchmarks, establishing state-of-the-art performance in both entropy and
accuracy. A series of experiments further validate the effectiveness of our
approach. Code is available at https://github.com/CURE-Project/CURE.

TL;DR: 论文通过扩展强彩票假设（SLTH）到量化网络，证明了在有限精度下，目标离散神经网络可以被精确表示，并给出了初始网络过参数化的最优界限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化是提高神经网络效率的关键技术，但理论理解有限。现有研究主要针对连续设置，无法直接应用于量化网络。

Method: 基于Borgs等人的数分割问题结果，推导了量化随机子集和问题的新理论，并扩展SLTH框架到有限精度网络。

Result: 在量化设置下，目标离散神经网络可被精确表示，且初始网络的过参数化界限是最优的。

Conclusion: 研究填补了量化神经网络理论空白，为高效网络设计提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Quantization is an essential technique for making neural networks more
efficient, yet our theoretical understanding of it remains limited. Previous
works demonstrated that extremely low-precision networks, such as binary
networks, can be constructed by pruning large, randomly-initialized networks,
and showed that the ratio between the size of the original and the pruned
networks is at most polylogarithmic.
  The specific pruning method they employed inspired a line of theoretical work
known as the Strong Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (SLTH), which leverages insights
from the Random Subset Sum Problem. However, these results primarily address
the continuous setting and cannot be applied to extend SLTH results to the
quantized setting.
  In this work, we build on foundational results by Borgs et al. on the Number
Partitioning Problem to derive new theoretical results for the Random Subset
Sum Problem in a quantized setting.
  Using these results, we then extend the SLTH framework to finite-precision
networks. While prior work on SLTH showed that pruning allows approximation of
a certain class of neural networks, we demonstrate that, in the quantized
setting, the analogous class of target discrete neural networks can be
represented exactly, and we prove optimal bounds on the necessary
overparameterization of the initial network as a function of the precision of
the target network.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为zono-conformal prediction的新方法，通过构建预测zonotopes来解决传统方法计算成本高和数据需求大的问题，同时提供统计覆盖保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法计算成本高、数据需求大，且多维度输出依赖关系捕捉能力有限，因此需要一种更高效、更灵活的不确定性量化方法。

Method: 基于区间预测模型和reachset-conformant identification，通过单一线性程序构建预测zonotopes，适用于非线性基预测器（如神经网络）。

Result: zono-conformal predictors在测试数据上与传统方法覆盖相似，但更少保守，且在分类和回归任务中均有效。

Conclusion: zono-conformal prediction是一种高效、灵活且统计有效的不确定性量化方法，优于现有技术。

Abstract: Conformal prediction is a popular uncertainty quantification method that
augments a base predictor with prediction sets with statistically valid
coverage guarantees. However, current methods are often computationally
expensive and data-intensive, as they require constructing an uncertainty model
before calibration. Moreover, existing approaches typically represent the
prediction sets with intervals, which limits their ability to capture
dependencies in multi-dimensional outputs. We address these limitations by
introducing zono-conformal prediction, a novel approach inspired by interval
predictor models and reachset-conformant identification that constructs
prediction zonotopes with assured coverage. By placing zonotopic uncertainty
sets directly into the model of the base predictor, zono-conformal predictors
can be identified via a single, data-efficient linear program. While we can
apply zono-conformal prediction to arbitrary nonlinear base predictors, we
focus on feed-forward neural networks in this work. Aside from regression
tasks, we also construct optimal zono-conformal predictors in classification
settings where the output of an uncertain predictor is a set of possible
classes. We provide probabilistic coverage guarantees and present methods for
detecting outliers in the identification data. In extensive numerical
experiments, we show that zono-conformal predictors are less conservative than
interval predictor models and standard conformal prediction methods, while
achieving a similar coverage over the test data.

Motivation: 研究学习过程中信心的作用及其与概率的区别，以统一文献中的相关概念（如学习率、训练周期等）。

Method: 通过公理化定义学习中的信心，提出两种连续测量方法，并证明其普适性；进一步推导出基于向量场和损失函数的紧凑表示。

Result: 证明了信心可以统一表示，并扩展了复合“并行”观察的语言；贝叶斯规则被特化为线性期望的优化学习器。

Conclusion: 信心是学习中的独立概念，可通过统一框架表示，为理解学习动态提供了新视角。

Abstract: We characterize a notion of confidence that arises in learning or updating
beliefs: the amount of trust one has in incoming information and its impact on
the belief state. This learner's confidence can be used alongside (and is
easily mistaken for) probability or likelihood, but it is fundamentally a
different concept -- one that captures many familiar concepts in the
literature, including learning rates and number of training epochs, Shafer's
weight of evidence, and Kalman gain. We formally axiomatize what it means to
learn with confidence, give two canonical ways of measuring confidence on a
continuum, and prove that confidence can always be represented in this way.
Under additional assumptions, we derive more compact representations of
confidence-based learning in terms of vector fields and loss functions. These
representations induce an extended language of compound "parallel"
observations. We characterize Bayes Rule as the special case of an optimizing
learner whose loss representation is a linear expectation.

Result: 通过合成实验和实际数据验证了算法的有效性。

Conclusion: 广义非正态分布的精度矩阵可用于推断条件独立结构，算法具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: For general non-Gaussian distributions, the covariance and precision matrices
do not encode the independence structure of the variables, as they do for the
multivariate Gaussian. This paper builds on previous work to show that for a
class of non-Gaussian distributions -- those derived from diagonal
transformations of a Gaussian -- information about the conditional independence
structure can still be inferred from the precision matrix, provided the data
meet certain criteria, analogous to the Gaussian case. We call such
transformations of the Gaussian as the generalized nonparanormal. The functions
that define these transformations are, in a broad sense, arbitrary. We also
provide a simple and computationally efficient algorithm that leverages this
theory to recover conditional independence structure from the generalized
nonparanormal data. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated
via synthetic experiments and applications to real-world data.

Motivation: 后解释方法（如LIME和SHAP）被广泛用于评估模型偏差和泛化性，但它们易受对抗性操纵，可能掩盖有害偏差。因此，研究这些方法的脆弱性并探索改进策略具有重要意义。

Method: 论文首先复现了COMPAS实验以验证先前发现，随后提出模块化测试框架，系统评估增强和集成解释方法在不同性能分类器上的表现。

Result: 研究发现某些LIME/SHAP集成配置能显著提高对偏差的检测能力，优于原始方法。

Conclusion: 这些改进方法有望在高风险机器学习系统的部署中提升透明度。

Abstract: Post hoc explanation methods, such as LIME and SHAP, provide interpretable
insights into black-box classifiers and are increasingly used to assess model
biases and generalizability. However, these methods are vulnerable to
adversarial manipulation, potentially concealing harmful biases. Building on
the work of Slack et al. (2020), we investigate the susceptibility of LIME and
SHAP to biased models and evaluate strategies for improving robustness. We
first replicate the original COMPAS experiment to validate prior findings and
establish a baseline. We then introduce a modular testing framework enabling
systematic evaluation of augmented and ensemble explanation approaches across
classifiers of varying performance. Using this framework, we assess multiple
LIME/SHAP ensemble configurations on out-of-distribution models, comparing
their resistance to bias concealment against the original methods. Our results
identify configurations that substantially improve bias detection, highlighting
their potential for enhancing transparency in the deployment of high-stakes
machine learning systems.

Abstract: Microbiome sample representation to input into LLMs is essential for
downstream tasks such as phenotype prediction and environmental classification.
While prior studies have explored embedding-based representations of each
microbiome sample, most rely on simple averaging over sequence embeddings,
often overlooking the biological importance of taxa abundance. In this work, we
propose an abundance-aware variant of the Set Transformer to construct
fixed-size sample-level embeddings by weighting sequence embeddings according
to their relative abundance. Without modifying the model architecture, we
replicate embedding vectors proportional to their abundance and apply
self-attention-based aggregation. Our method outperforms average pooling and
unweighted Set Transformers on real-world microbiome classification tasks,
achieving perfect performance in some cases. These results demonstrate the
utility of abundance-aware aggregation for robust and biologically informed
microbiome representation. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the
first approaches to integrate sequence-level abundance into Transformer-based
sample embeddings.

Motivation: 观看时间常被用作视频推荐平台中用户满意度的代理指标，但原始观看时间受视频时长、流行度和用户行为等混杂因素影响，可能导致推荐模型偏差。

Result: 离线和在线实验均显示，该方法在推荐准确性和鲁棒性上优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了观看时间中的混杂偏差问题，为推荐系统提供了更可靠的偏好信号。

Abstract: Watch time is widely used as a proxy for user satisfaction in video
recommendation platforms. However, raw watch times are influenced by
confounding factors such as video duration, popularity, and individual user
behaviors, potentially distorting preference signals and resulting in biased
recommendation models. We propose a novel relative advantage debiasing
framework that corrects watch time by comparing it to empirically derived
reference distributions conditioned on user and item groups. This approach
yields a quantile-based preference signal and introduces a two-stage
architecture that explicitly separates distribution estimation from preference
learning. Additionally, we present distributional embeddings to efficiently
parameterize watch-time quantiles without requiring online sampling or storage
of historical data. Both offline and online experiments demonstrate significant
improvements in recommendation accuracy and robustness compared to existing
baseline methods.

Conclusion: 压缩元学习框架为高效、隐私友好的学习提供了新方向。

Abstract: The rapid expansion in the size of new datasets has created a need for fast
and efficient parameter-learning techniques. Compressive learning is a
framework that enables efficient processing by using random, non-linear
features to project large-scale databases onto compact, information-preserving
representations whose dimensionality is independent of the number of samples
and can be easily stored, transferred, and processed. These database-level
summaries are then used to decode parameters of interest from the underlying
data distribution without requiring access to the original samples, offering an
efficient and privacy-friendly learning framework. However, both the encoding
and decoding techniques are typically randomized and data-independent, failing
to exploit the underlying structure of the data. In this work, we propose a
framework that meta-learns both the encoding and decoding stages of compressive
learning methods by using neural networks that provide faster and more accurate
systems than the current state-of-the-art approaches. To demonstrate the
potential of the presented Compressive Meta-Learning framework, we explore
multiple applications -- including neural network-based compressive PCA,
compressive ridge regression, compressive k-means, and autoencoders.

Abstract: While the ICD code assignment problem has been widely studied, most works
have focused on post-discharge document classification. Models for early
forecasting of this information could be used for identifying health risks,
suggesting effective treatments, or optimizing resource allocation. To address
the challenge of predictive modeling using the limited information at the
beginning of a patient stay, we propose a multimodal system to fuse clinical
notes and tabular events captured in electronic health records. The model
integrates pre-trained encoders, feature pooling, and cross-modal attention to
learn optimal representations across modalities and balance their presence at
every temporal point. Moreover, we present a weighted temporal loss that
adjusts its contribution at each point in time. Experiments show that these
strategies enhance the early prediction model, outperforming the current
state-of-the-art systems.

Conclusion: 结合多模态特征、层次图结构和注意力机制，显著提升个性化时尚推荐的准确性和效率。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of the fashion industry and the growing variety of
products have made it challenging for users to find compatible items on
e-commerce platforms. Effective fashion recommendation systems are crucial for
filtering irrelevant items and suggesting suitable ones. However,
simultaneously addressing outfit compatibility and personalized recommendations
remains a significant challenge, as these aspects are often treated
independently in existing studies, often overlooking the complex interactions
between items and user preferences. This research introduces a new framework
named FGAT, inspired by the HFGN model, which leverages graph neural networks
and graph attention mechanisms to tackle this issue. The proposed framework
constructs a three-tier hierarchical graph of users, outfits, and items,
integrating visual and textual features to simultaneously model outfit
compatibility and user preferences. A graph attention mechanism dynamically
weights node importance during representation propagation, enabling the capture
of key interactions and generating precise representations for both user
preferences and outfit compatibility. Evaluated on the POG dataset, FGAT
outperforms baseline models such as HFGN, achieving improved results in
precision, HR, recall, NDCG, and accuracy.These results demonstrate that
combining multimodal visual-textual features with a hierarchical graph
structure and attention mechanisms significantly enhances the accuracy and
efficiency of personalized fashion recommendation systems.

Abstract: Optimization problems over discrete or quantized variables are very
challenging in general due to the combinatorial nature of their search space.
Piecewise-affine regularization (PAR) provides a flexible modeling and
computational framework for quantization based on continuous optimization. In
this work, we focus on the setting of supervised learning and investigate the
theoretical foundations of PAR from optimization and statistical perspectives.
First, we show that in the overparameterized regime, where the number of
parameters exceeds the number of samples, every critical point of the
PAR-regularized loss function exhibits a high degree of quantization. Second,
we derive closed-form proximal mappings for various (convex, quasi-convex, and
non-convex) PARs and show how to solve PAR-regularized problems using the
proximal gradient method, its accelerated variant, and the Alternating
Direction Method of Multipliers. Third, we study statistical guarantees of
PAR-regularized linear regression problems; specifically, we can approximate
classical formulations of $\ell_1$-, squared $\ell_2$-, and nonconvex
regularizations using PAR and obtain similar statistical guarantees with
quantized solutions.

Conclusion: CTRL能有效提升多源数据预测的准确性和差异性，适用于实际应用场景。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) tasks often utilize large-scale data that is drawn from
several distinct sources, such as different locations, treatment arms, or
groups. In such settings, practitioners often desire predictions that not only
exhibit good overall accuracy, but also remain reliable within each source and
preserve the differences that matter across sources. For instance, several
asylum and refugee resettlement programs now use ML-based employment
predictions to guide where newly arriving families are placed within a host
country, which requires generating informative and differentiated predictions
for many and often small source locations. However, this task is made
challenging by several common characteristics of the data in these settings:
the presence of numerous distinct data sources, distributional shifts between
them, and substantial variation in sample sizes across sources. This paper
introduces Clustered Transfer Residual Learning (CTRL), a meta-learning method
that combines the strengths of cross-domain residual learning and adaptive
pooling/clustering in order to simultaneously improve overall accuracy and
preserve source-level heterogeneity. We provide theoretical results that
clarify how our objective navigates the trade-off between data quantity and
data quality. We evaluate CTRL alongside other state-of-the-art benchmarks on 5
large-scale datasets. This includes a dataset from the national asylum program
in Switzerland, where the algorithmic geographic assignment of asylum seekers
is currently being piloted. CTRL consistently outperforms the benchmarks across
several key metrics and when using a range of different base learners.

Abstract: Bayesian network classifiers provide a feasible solution to tabular data
classification, with a number of merits like high time and memory efficiency,
and great explainability. However, due to the parameter explosion and data
sparsity issues, Bayesian network classifiers are restricted to low-order
feature dependency modeling, making them struggle in extrapolating the
occurrence probabilities of complex real-world data. In this paper, we propose
a novel paradigm to design high-order Bayesian network classifiers, by learning
distributional representations for feature values, as what has been done in
word embedding and graph representation learning. The learned distributional
representations are encoded with the semantic relatedness between different
features through their observed co-occurrence patterns in training data, which
then serve as a hallmark to extrapolate the occurrence probabilities of new
test samples. As a classifier design realization, we remake the K-dependence
Bayesian classifier (KDB) by extending it into a neural version, i.e.,
NeuralKDB, where a novel neural network architecture is designed to learn
distributional representations of feature values and parameterize the
conditional probabilities between interdependent features. A stochastic
gradient descent based algorithm is designed to train the NeuralKDB model
efficiently. Extensive classification experiments on 60 UCI datasets
demonstrate that the proposed NeuralKDB classifier excels in capturing
high-order feature dependencies and significantly outperforms the conventional
Bayesian network classifiers, as well as other competitive classifiers,
including two neural network based classifiers without distributional
representation learning.

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem produces massive volumes of multimodal
data from diverse sources, including sensors, cameras, and microphones. With
advances in edge intelligence, IoT devices have evolved from simple data
acquisition units into computationally capable nodes, enabling localized
processing of heterogeneous multimodal data. This evolution necessitates
distributed learning paradigms that can efficiently handle such data.
Furthermore, the continuous nature of data generation and the limited storage
capacity of edge devices demand an online learning framework. Multimodal Online
Federated Learning (MMO-FL) has emerged as a promising approach to meet these
requirements. However, MMO-FL faces new challenges due to the inherent
instability of IoT devices, which often results in modality quantity and
quality imbalance (QQI) during data collection. In this work, we systematically
investigate the impact of QQI within the MMO-FL framework and present a
comprehensive theoretical analysis quantifying how both types of imbalance
degrade learning performance. To address these challenges, we propose the
Modality Quantity and Quality Rebalanced (QQR) algorithm, a prototype learning
based method designed to operate in parallel with the training process.
Extensive experiments on two real-world multimodal datasets show that the
proposed QQR algorithm consistently outperforms benchmarks under modality
imbalance conditions with promising learning performance.

Motivation: 多视图学习常面临视图和标签缺失问题，现有方法（如信息瓶颈）无法利用未标记数据。

Method: 提出半监督生成模型，结合标记和未标记数据，最大化未标记样本的似然，并通过跨视图互信息增强共享信息提取。

Result: 在图像和多组学数据上，模型在预测和填补缺失视图方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了多视图学习中的缺失问题，提升了性能。

Abstract: Multi-view learning is widely applied to real-life datasets, such as multiple
omics biological data, but it often suffers from both missing views and missing
labels. Prior probabilistic approaches addressed the missing view problem by
using a product-of-experts scheme to aggregate representations from present
views and achieved superior performance over deterministic classifiers, using
the information bottleneck (IB) principle. However, the IB framework is
inherently fully supervised and cannot leverage unlabeled data. In this work,
we propose a semi-supervised generative model that utilizes both labeled and
unlabeled samples in a unified framework. Our method maximizes the likelihood
of unlabeled samples to learn a latent space shared with the IB on labeled
data. We also perform cross-view mutual information maximization in the latent
space to enhance the extraction of shared information across views. Compared to
existing approaches, our model achieves better predictive and imputation
performance on both image and multi-omics data with missing views and limited
labeled samples.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统概率深度学习依赖高斯先验，无法准确捕捉复杂非高斯数据（如生物数据），而Boltzmann分布虽更具表达力，但经典计算难以实现。量子方法因硬件限制未能应用于深度学习。

Method: 提出QBM-VAE，结合量子处理器采样Boltzmann分布作为先验，构建深度生成模型。

Conclusion: QBM-VAE展示了量子优势在深度学习中的实际应用，为开发混合量子AI模型提供了可转移的蓝图，同时突破了数据限制，增强了科学发现能力。

Abstract: A fundamental limitation of probabilistic deep learning is its predominant
reliance on Gaussian priors. This simplistic assumption prevents models from
accurately capturing the complex, non-Gaussian landscapes of natural data,
particularly in demanding domains like complex biological data, severely
hindering the fidelity of the model for scientific discovery. The
physically-grounded Boltzmann distribution offers a more expressive
alternative, but it is computationally intractable on classical computers. To
date, quantum approaches have been hampered by the insufficient qubit scale and
operational stability required for the iterative demands of deep learning.
Here, we bridge this gap by introducing the Quantum Boltzmann
Machine-Variational Autoencoder (QBM-VAE), a large-scale and long-time stable
hybrid quantum-classical architecture. Our framework leverages a quantum
processor for efficient sampling from the Boltzmann distribution, enabling its
use as a powerful prior within a deep generative model. Applied to
million-scale single-cell datasets from multiple sources, the QBM-VAE generates
a latent space that better preserves complex biological structures,
consistently outperforming conventional Gaussian-based deep learning models
like VAE and SCVI in essential tasks such as omics data integration, cell-type
classification, and trajectory inference. It also provides a typical example of
introducing a physics priori into deep learning to drive the model to acquire
scientific discovery capabilities that breaks through data limitations. This
work provides the demonstration of a practical quantum advantage in deep
learning on a large-scale scientific problem and offers a transferable
blueprint for developing hybrid quantum AI models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统结构保持方法在动态系统建模中需要固定系统配置，且对未知参数适应性差，限制了其在多查询或参数变化场景中的应用。

Method: 引入基于调制的元学习框架，通过紧凑的潜在表示直接调节结构保持模型，避免了对系统参数的显式优化和灰盒知识需求。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在少样本学习场景下实现了准确预测，同时保持了动态稳定性和参数空间中的泛化性能。

Conclusion: 该框架为参数化动态系统的可扩展和通用学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Structure-preserving approaches to dynamics modeling have demonstrated great
potential for modeling physical systems due to their strong inductive biases
that enforce conservation laws and dissipative behavior. However, the resulting
models are typically trained for fixed system configurations, requiring
explicit knowledge of system parameters as well as costly retraining for each
new set of parameters -- a major limitation in many-query or parameter-varying
scenarios. Meta-learning offers a potential solution, but existing approaches
like optimization-based meta-learning often suffer from training instability or
limited generalization capability. Inspired by ideas from computer vision, we
introduce a modulation-based meta-learning framework that directly conditions
structure-preserving models on compact latent representations of potentially
unknown system parameters, avoiding the need for gray-box system knowledge and
explicit optimization during adaptation. Through the application of novel
modulation strategies to parametric energy-conserving and dissipative systems,
we enable scalable and generalizable learning across parametric families of
dynamical systems. Experiments on standard benchmark problems demonstrate that
our approach achieves accurate predictions in few-shot learning settings,
without compromising on the essential physical constraints necessary for
dynamical stability and effective generalization performance across parameter
space.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床希望在早期阶段就能进行可靠的风险评估，尽管后期预测通常更精确。

Method: BFF框架将每个时间窗口视为独立模态，利用后期数据监督早期学习。

Result: 在两个真实儿科预测任务中验证，BFF显著提升了早期风险评估性能。

Conclusion: BFF通过借用未来信息有效改善了早期预测，具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Risk assessments for a pediatric population are often conducted across
multiple stages. For example, clinicians may evaluate risks prenatally, at
birth, and during Well-Child visits. Although predictions made at later stages
typically achieve higher precision, it is clinically desirable to make reliable
risk assessments as early as possible. Therefore, this study focuses on
improving prediction performance in early-stage risk assessments. Our solution,
\textbf{Borrowing From the Future (BFF)}, is a contrastive multi-modal
framework that treats each time window as a distinct modality. In BFF, a model
is trained on all available data throughout the time while performing a risk
assessment using up-to-date information. This contrastive framework allows the
model to ``borrow'' informative signals from later stages (e.g., Well-Child
visits) to implicitly supervise the learning at earlier stages (e.g.,
prenatal/birth stages). We validate BFF on two real-world pediatric outcome
prediction tasks, demonstrating consistent improvements in early risk
assessments. The code is available at https://github.com/scotsun/bff.

Abstract: Explanations of cognitive behavior often appeal to computations over
representations. What does it take for a system to implement a given
computation over suitable representational vehicles within that system? We
argue that the language of causality -- and specifically the theory of causal
abstraction -- provides a fruitful lens on this topic. Drawing on current
discussions in deep learning with artificial neural networks, we illustrate how
classical themes in the philosophy of computation and cognition resurface in
contemporary machine learning. We offer an account of computational
implementation grounded in causal abstraction, and examine the role for
representation in the resulting picture. We argue that these issues are most
profitably explored in connection with generalization and prediction.

Motivation: 全球气候变化加剧，PM2.5浓度预测对环境保护、公共健康和城市管理至关重要。

Method: 采用CNN提取局部空间特征，LSTM建模时间序列依赖，使用北京工业区2010-2015年的多元数据集进行6小时PM2.5浓度预测。

Result: 模型RMSE为5.236，优于传统时间序列模型，展示了在空气污染预警中的潜力。

Conclusion: 模型在精度和泛化性上表现优异，但计算复杂度高，未来需优化多变量处理能力和扩展应用场景。

Abstract: With the intensification of global climate change, accurate prediction of air
quality indicators, especially PM2.5 concentration, has become increasingly
important in fields such as environmental protection, public health, and urban
management. To address this, we propose an air quality PM2.5 index prediction
model based on a hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture. The model effectively combines
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for local spatial feature extraction and
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for modeling temporal dependencies in
time series data. Using a multivariate dataset collected from an industrial
area in Beijing between 2010 and 2015 -- which includes hourly records of PM2.5
concentration, temperature, dew point, pressure, wind direction, wind speed,
and precipitation -- the model predicts the average PM2.5 concentration over
6-hour intervals. Experimental results show that the model achieves a root mean
square error (RMSE) of 5.236, outperforming traditional time series models in
both accuracy and generalization. This demonstrates its strong potential in
real-world applications such as air pollution early warning systems. However,
due to the complexity of multivariate inputs, the model demands high
computational resources, and its ability to handle diverse atmospheric factors
still requires optimization. Future work will focus on enhancing scalability
and expanding support for more complex multivariate weather prediction tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents an enhanced version of the Interactive Voting-Based Map
Matching algorithm, designed to efficiently process trajectories with varying
sampling rates. The main aim is to reconstruct GPS trajectories with high
accuracy, independent of input data quality. Building upon the original
algorithm, developed exclusively for aligning GPS signals to road networks, we
extend its capabilities by integrating trajectory imputation. Our improvements
also include the implementation of a distance-bounded interactive voting
strategy to reduce computational complexity, as well as modifications to
address missing data in the road network. Furthermore, we incorporate a
custom-built asset derived from OpenStreetMap, enabling this approach to be
smoothly applied in any geographic region covered by OpenStreetMap's road

Abstract: There has been a growing interest in developing diffusion-based Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs), building on the connections between message passing mechanisms
in GNNs and physical diffusion processes. However, existing methods suffer from
three critical limitations: (1) they rely on homogeneous diffusion with static
dynamics, limiting adaptability to diverse graph structures; (2) their depth is
constrained by computational overhead and diminishing interpretability; and (3)
theoretical understanding of their convergence behavior remains limited. To
address these challenges, we propose GODNF, a Generalized Opinion Dynamics
Neural Framework, which unifies multiple opinion dynamics models into a
principled, trainable diffusion mechanism. Our framework captures heterogeneous
diffusion patterns and temporal dynamics via node-specific behavior modeling
and dynamic neighborhood influence, while ensuring efficient and interpretable
message propagation even at deep layers. We provide a rigorous theoretical
analysis demonstrating GODNF's ability to model diverse convergence
configurations. Extensive empirical evaluations of node classification and
influence estimation tasks confirm GODNF's superiority over state-of-the-art
GNNs.

Result: 在五个数据集上实验表明，该框架在准确性和公平性之间取得了良好平衡，且优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为封闭权重LLMs的公平分类提供了一种高效且数据友好的解决方案。

Abstract: Instruction fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) enable a simple zero-shot
or few-shot prompting paradigm, also known as in-context learning, for building
prediction models. This convenience, combined with continued advances in LLM
capability, has the potential to drive their adoption across a broad range of
domains, including high-stakes applications where group fairness -- preventing
disparate impacts across demographic groups -- is essential. The majority of
existing approaches to enforcing group fairness on LLM-based classifiers rely
on traditional fair algorithms applied via model fine-tuning or head-tuning on
final-layer embeddings, but they are no longer applicable to closed-weight LLMs
under the in-context learning setting, which include some of the most capable
commercial models today, such as GPT-4, Gemini, and Claude. In this paper, we
propose a framework for deriving fair classifiers from closed-weight LLMs via
prompting: the LLM is treated as a feature extractor, and features are elicited
from its probabilistic predictions (e.g., token log probabilities) using
prompts strategically designed for the specified fairness criterion to obtain
sufficient statistics for fair classification; a fair algorithm is then applied
to these features to train a lightweight fair classifier in a post-hoc manner.
Experiments on five datasets, including three tabular ones, demonstrate strong
accuracy-fairness tradeoffs for the classifiers derived by our framework from
both open-weight and closed-weight LLMs; in particular, our framework is
data-efficient and outperforms fair classifiers trained on LLM embeddings
(i.e., head-tuning) or from scratch on raw tabular features.

Motivation: 脉冲神经网络（SNNs）在能效和类脑计算方面具有潜力，但其对抗扰动的脆弱性尚未被充分理解。本文旨在探索SNNs的对抗鲁棒性。

Method: 通过时间集成将网络视为离散时间步上演化的子网络集合，提出RTE框架，结合统一损失函数和随机采样策略优化训练。

Result: 实验表明，RTE在多个基准测试中优于现有方法，改善了鲁棒性与准确性的权衡，并重塑了SNNs的内部鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RTE为构建鲁棒的脉冲神经网络提供了理论基础，强调了时间结构在对抗学习中的重要性。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a promising direction for
energy-efficient and brain-inspired computing, yet their vulnerability to
adversarial perturbations remains poorly understood. In this work, we revisit
the adversarial robustness of SNNs through the lens of temporal ensembling,
treating the network as a collection of evolving sub-networks across discrete
timesteps. This formulation uncovers two critical but underexplored
challenges-the fragility of individual temporal sub-networks and the tendency
for adversarial vulnerabilities to transfer across time. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Robust Temporal self-Ensemble (RTE), a training
framework that improves the robustness of each sub-network while reducing the
temporal transferability of adversarial perturbations. RTE integrates both
objectives into a unified loss and employs a stochastic sampling strategy for
efficient optimization. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks
demonstrate that RTE consistently outperforms existing training methods in
robust-accuracy trade-off. Additional analyses reveal that RTE reshapes the
internal robustness landscape of SNNs, leading to more resilient and temporally
diversified decision boundaries. Our study highlights the importance of
temporal structure in adversarial learning and offers a principled foundation
for building robust spiking models.

Result: 实验验证了模型在转导和归纳学习中的有效性。

Conclusion: HS-GPPT通过频谱对齐显著提升了知识迁移效果。

Abstract: Graph ``pre-training and prompt-tuning'' aligns downstream tasks with
pre-trained objectives to enable efficient knowledge transfer under limited
supervision. However, existing methods rely on homophily-based low-frequency
knowledge, failing to handle diverse spectral distributions in real-world
graphs with varying homophily. Our theoretical analysis reveals a spectral
specificity principle: optimal knowledge transfer requires alignment between
pre-trained spectral filters and the intrinsic spectrum of downstream graphs.
Under limited supervision, large spectral gaps between pre-training and
downstream tasks impede effective adaptation. To bridge this gap, we propose
the HS-GPPT model, a novel framework that ensures spectral alignment throughout
both pre-training and prompt-tuning. We utilize a hybrid spectral filter
backbone and local-global contrastive learning to acquire abundant spectral
knowledge. Then we design prompt graphs to align the spectral distribution with
pretexts, facilitating spectral knowledge transfer across homophily and
heterophily. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness under both
transductive and inductive learning settings. Our code is available at

Abstract: We introduce RegimeNAS, a novel differentiable architecture search framework
specifically designed to enhance cryptocurrency trading performance by
explicitly integrating market regime awareness. Addressing the limitations of
static deep learning models in highly dynamic financial environments, RegimeNAS
features three core innovations: (1) a theoretically grounded Bayesian search
space optimizing architectures with provable convergence properties; (2)
specialized, dynamically activated neural modules (Volatility, Trend, and Range
blocks) tailored for distinct market conditions; and (3) a multi-objective loss
function incorporating market-specific penalties (e.g., volatility matching,
transition smoothness) alongside mathematically enforced Lipschitz stability
constraints. Regime identification leverages multi-head attention across
multiple timeframes for improved accuracy and uncertainty estimation. Rigorous
empirical evaluation on extensive real-world cryptocurrency data demonstrates
that RegimeNAS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks, achieving
an 80.3% Mean Absolute Error reduction compared to the best traditional
recurrent baseline and converging substantially faster (9 vs. 50+ epochs).
Ablation studies and regime-specific analysis confirm the critical contribution
of each component, particularly the regime-aware adaptation mechanism. This
work underscores the imperative of embedding domain-specific knowledge, such as
market regimes, directly within the NAS process to develop robust and adaptive
models for challenging financial applications.

Motivation: 现有CP方法在长尾标签分布下存在对头部类别覆盖过度而尾部类别覆盖不足的问题，影响了预测集的可靠性。

Conclusion: TACP和sTACP能有效解决长尾分布下的覆盖不平衡问题，提升预测集的可靠性。

Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) is a popular method for uncertainty quantification
that converts a pretrained model's point prediction into a prediction set, with
the set size reflecting the model's confidence. Although existing CP methods
are guaranteed to achieve marginal coverage, they often exhibit imbalanced
coverage across classes under long-tail label distributions, tending to over
cover the head classes at the expense of under covering the remaining tail
classes. This under coverage is particularly concerning, as it undermines the
reliability of the prediction sets for minority classes, even with coverage
ensured on average. In this paper, we propose the Tail-Aware Conformal
Prediction (TACP) method to mitigate the under coverage of the tail classes by
utilizing the long-tail structure and narrowing the head-tail coverage gap.
Theoretical analysis shows that it consistently achieves a smaller head-tail
coverage gap than standard methods. To further improve coverage balance across
all classes, we introduce an extension of TACP: soft TACP (sTACP) via a
reweighting mechanism. The proposed framework can be combined with various
non-conformity scores, and experiments on multiple long-tail benchmark datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.

Result: 实验表明，NeMo在模块分类精度上平均提升1.72%，模块大小减少58.10%，适用于CNN和Transformer模型。

Conclusion: NeMo为DNN模块化提供了可扩展且通用的解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: With the growing incorporation of deep neural network (DNN) models into
modern software systems, the prohibitive construction costs have become a
significant challenge. Model reuse has been widely applied to reduce training
costs, but indiscriminately reusing entire models may incur significant
inference overhead. Consequently, DNN modularization has gained attention,
enabling module reuse by decomposing DNN models. The emerging
modularizing-while-training (MwT) paradigm, which incorporates modularization
into training, outperforms modularizing-after-training approaches. However,
existing MwT methods focus on small-scale CNN models at the convolutional
kernel level and struggle with diverse DNNs and large-scale models,
particularly Transformer-based models. To address these limitations, we propose
NeMo, a scalable and generalizable MwT approach. NeMo operates at the neuron
level fundamental component common to all DNNs-ensuring applicability to
Transformers and various architectures. We design a contrastive learning-based
modular training method with an effective composite loss function, enabling
scalability to large-scale models. Comprehensive experiments on two
Transformer-based models and four CNN models across two classification datasets
demonstrate NeMo's superiority over state-of-the-art MwT methods. Results show
average gains of 1.72% in module classification accuracy and 58.10% reduction
in module size, demonstrating efficacy across both CNN and large-scale
Transformer-based models. A case study on open-source projects shows NeMo's
potential benefits in practical scenarios, offering a promising approach for
scalable and generalizable DNN modularization.

Abstract: Afforestation and reforestation are popular strategies for mitigating climate
change by enhancing carbon sequestration. However, the effectiveness of these
efforts is often self-reported by project developers, or certified through
processes with limited external validation. This leads to concerns about data
reliability and project integrity. In response to increasing scrutiny of
voluntary carbon markets, this study presents a dataset on global afforestation
and reforestation efforts compiled from primary (meta-)information and
augmented with time-series satellite imagery and other secondary data. Our
dataset covers 1,289,068 planting sites from 45,628 projects spanning 33 years.
Since any remote sensing-based validation effort relies on the integrity of a
planting site's geographic boundary, this dataset introduces a standardized
assessment of the provided site-level location information, which we summarize
in one easy-to-communicate key indicator: LDIS -- the Location Data Integrity
Score. We find that approximately 79\% of the georeferenced planting sites
monitored fail on at least 1 out of 10 LDIS indicators, while 15\% of the
monitored projects lack machine-readable georeferenced data in the first place.
In addition to enhancing accountability in the voluntary carbon market, the
presented dataset also holds value as training data for e.g. computer
vision-related tasks with millions of linked Sentinel-2 and Planetscope
satellite images.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为HGD的梯度下降算法，通过平衡不同类别的梯度范数来解决数据流中的类别不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的数据通常是随时间顺序收集的，且常呈现类别不平衡分布。现有方法多采用重采样或重加权策略，本文通过改进训练过程，特别是梯度下降技术，来解决这一问题。

Method: 提出HGD算法，通过平衡不同类别的梯度范数，避免小类别欠拟合，实现平衡在线学习。HGD无需数据缓冲区、额外参数或先验知识，适用于任何基于梯度下降的模型。

Result: 理论分析表明HGD具有次线性遗憾界。实验验证了HGD在多种不平衡数据流场景下的高效性和有效性。

Conclusion: HGD是一种高效且通用的方法，适用于不平衡数据流学习，无需额外资源或复杂调整。

Abstract: Many real-world data are sequentially collected over time and often exhibit
skewed class distributions, resulting in imbalanced data streams. While
existing approaches have explored several strategies, such as resampling and
reweighting, for imbalanced data stream learning, our work distinguishes itself
by addressing the imbalance problem through training modification, particularly
focusing on gradient descent techniques. We introduce the harmonized gradient
descent (HGD) algorithm, which aims to equalize the norms of gradients across
different classes. By ensuring the gradient norm balance, HGD mitigates
under-fitting for minor classes and achieves balanced online learning. Notably,
HGD operates in a streamlined implementation process, requiring no data-buffer,
extra parameters, or prior knowledge, making it applicable to any learning
models utilizing gradient descent for optimization. Theoretical analysis, based
on a few common and mild assumptions, shows that HGD achieves a satisfied
sub-linear regret bound. The proposed algorithm are compared with the commonly
used online imbalance learning methods under several imbalanced data stream
scenarios. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the efficiency and
effectiveness of HGD in learning imbalanced data streams.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于熵的机制（ETMR和EAR），以优化测试时强化学习中的探索-利用平衡，显著提升了模型在无监督场景下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在复杂推理任务中表现优异，但对标注数据依赖性强，且无监督适应性不足。测试时强化学习（TTRL）虽能自我优化，但面临高推理成本和早期估计偏差等问题。

Method: 引入熵机制，包括Entropy-fork Tree Majority Rollout（ETMR）和Entropy-based Advantage Reshaping（EAR），以平衡探索与利用。

Result: 在AIME 2024基准测试中，Llama3.1-8B的Pass at 1指标相对提升68%，同时仅消耗60%的token预算。

Conclusion: 该方法在推理效率、多样性和估计鲁棒性之间取得了有效平衡，推动了无监督强化学习在开放域推理任务中的应用。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models have yielded significant
improvements in complex reasoning tasks such as mathematics and programming.
However, these models remain heavily dependent on annotated data and exhibit
limited adaptability in unsupervised scenarios. To address these limitations,
test-time reinforcement learning (TTRL) has been proposed, which enables
self-optimization by leveraging model-generated pseudo-labels. Despite its
promise, TTRL faces several key challenges, including high inference costs due
to parallel rollouts and early-stage estimation bias that fosters
overconfidence, reducing output diversity and causing performance plateaus. To
address these challenges, we introduce an entropy-based mechanism to enhance
the exploration-exploitation balance in test-time reinforcement learning
through two strategies: Entropy-fork Tree Majority Rollout (ETMR) and
Entropy-based Advantage Reshaping (EAR). Compared with the baseline, our
approach enables Llama3.1-8B to achieve a 68 percent relative improvement in
Pass at 1 metric on the AIME 2024 benchmark, while consuming only 60 percent of
the rollout tokens budget. This highlights our method's ability to effectively
optimize the trade-off between inference efficiency, diversity, and estimation
robustness, thereby advancing unsupervised reinforcement learning for
open-domain reasoning tasks.

Result: 在跨被试运动想象数据集上表现出色，无需被试特定校准即可超越现有方法。

Conclusion: PTSM通过解耦神经表征，在非稳态神经生理环境中实现个性化和可迁移的解码。

Abstract: Cross-subject electroencephalography (EEG) decoding remains a fundamental
challenge in brain-computer interface (BCI) research due to substantial
inter-subject variability and the scarcity of subject-invariant
representations. This paper proposed PTSM (Physiology-aware and Task-invariant
Spatio-temporal Modeling), a novel framework for interpretable and robust EEG
decoding across unseen subjects. PTSM employs a dual-branch masking mechanism
that independently learns personalized and shared spatio-temporal patterns,
enabling the model to preserve individual-specific neural characteristics while
extracting task-relevant, population-shared features. The masks are factorized
across temporal and spatial dimensions, allowing fine-grained modulation of
dynamic EEG patterns with low computational overhead. To further address
representational entanglement, PTSM enforces information-theoretic constraints
that decompose latent embeddings into orthogonal task-related and
subject-related subspaces. The model is trained end-to-end via a
multi-objective loss integrating classification, contrastive, and
disentanglement objectives. Extensive experiments on cross-subject motor
imagery datasets demonstrate that PTSM achieves strong zero-shot
generalization, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines without
subject-specific calibration. Results highlight the efficacy of disentangled
neural representations for achieving both personalized and transferable
decoding in non-stationary neurophysiological settings.

TL;DR: DFA是一种强化学习算法，结合个体奖励和成对偏好，直接利用策略的对数概率建模偏好概率，避免单独建模奖励。实验表明，DFA在控制环境中表现优于或匹配SAC，且在偏好数据集上优于RLHF基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习算法通常依赖个体奖励信号，而DFA旨在融合更丰富的偏好信息（如人类标注或合成偏好），提升学习效率和稳定性。

Method: DFA通过策略的对数概率直接建模偏好概率，无需单独奖励建模。偏好可来自人类标注或从离线回放缓冲区的Q值合成。基于Bradley-Terry模型，最小化偏好损失可恢复SAC策略。

Result: 在六个控制环境中，DFA表现优于或匹配SAC，训练更稳定。在半合成偏好数据集上，DFA优于RLHF基线，接近真实奖励的性能。

Conclusion: DFA通过融合偏好信息，提升了强化学习的性能和稳定性，尤其在偏好数据有限时表现突出。

Abstract: We present Dual-Feedback Actor (DFA), a reinforcement learning algorithm that
fuses both individual rewards and pairwise preferences (if available) into a
single update rule. DFA uses the policy's log-probabilities directly to model
the preference probability, avoiding a separate reward-modeling step.
Preferences can be provided by human-annotators (at state-level or
trajectory-level) or be synthesized online from Q-values stored in an
off-policy replay buffer. Under a Bradley-Terry model, we prove that minimizing
DFA's preference loss recovers the entropy-regularized Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)
policy. Our simulation results show that DFA trained on generated preferences
matches or exceeds SAC on six control environments and demonstrates a more
stable training process. With only a semi-synthetic preference dataset under
Bradley-Terry model, our algorithm outperforms reward-modeling reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF) baselines in a stochastic GridWorld and
approaches the performance of an oracle with true rewards.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 决策聚焦学习（DFL）通过训练机器学习模型预测优化问题参数，直接最小化决策后悔（即最大化决策质量）。本文提出使用替代损失函数，即使在使用可微分优化层时，也能显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于梯度的DFL方法在LP问题中面临梯度为零的问题，现有解决方案（平滑或替代损失）效果有限。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出即使在使用可微分优化层时，仍通过最小化替代损失函数来提升性能。实验验证了该方法在DYS-Net中的高效性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在决策后悔和训练时间上均优于现有方法，DYS-Net显著减少了训练时间。

Conclusion: 最小化替代损失函数是一种有效的方法，可提升DFL性能，尤其是在使用高效的可微分优化技术时。

Abstract: Decision-focused learning (DFL) trains a machine learning (ML) model to
predict parameters of an optimization problem, to directly minimize decision
regret, i.e., maximize decision quality. Gradient-based DFL requires computing
the derivative of the solution to the optimization problem with respect to the
predicted parameters. However, for many optimization problems, such as linear
programs (LPs), the gradient of the regret with respect to the predicted
parameters is zero almost everywhere. Existing gradient-based DFL approaches
for LPs try to circumvent this issue in one of two ways: (a) smoothing the LP
into a differentiable optimization problem by adding a quadratic regularizer
and then minimizing the regret directly or (b) minimizing surrogate losses that
have informative (sub)gradients. In this paper, we show that the former
approach still results in zero gradients, because even after smoothing the
regret remains constant across large regions of the parameter space. To address
this, we propose minimizing surrogate losses -- even when a differentiable
optimization layer is used and regret can be minimized directly. Our
experiments demonstrate that minimizing surrogate losses allows differentiable
optimization layers to achieve regret comparable to or better than
surrogate-loss based DFL methods. Further, we demonstrate that this also holds
for DYS-Net, a recently proposed differentiable optimization technique for LPs,
that computes approximate solutions and gradients through operations that can
be performed using feedforward neural network layers. Because DYS-Net executes
the forward and the backward pass very efficiently, by minimizing surrogate
losses using DYS-Net, we are able to attain regret on par with the
state-of-the-art while reducing training time by a significant margin.

Motivation: 现实世界中的复杂系统（如社交或生物网络）通常需要更高阶的拓扑结构来表示，而传统图神经网络在处理这些结构时存在信息失真（如过度挤压）的挑战。

Method: 通过Forman-Ricci曲率定义边基网络特性，将数据从基本图形式提升到更具表达力的拓扑结构，以揭示图的局部和全局特性（如网络骨干）。

Result: 该方法能够有效缓解长距离信息传递和网络瓶颈中的信息失真问题。

Conclusion: 提出的结构提升策略为几何与拓扑深度学习提供了一种新方法，尤其适用于复杂网络中的信息流建模。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks are highly effective at learning from relational data,
leveraging node and edge features while maintaining the symmetries inherent to
graph structures. However, many real-world systems, such as social or
biological networks, exhibit complex interactions that are more naturally
represented by higher-order topological domains. The emerging field of
Geometric and Topological Deep Learning addresses this challenge by introducing
methods that utilize and benefit from higher-order structures. Central to TDL
is the concept of lifting, which transforms data representations from basic
graph forms to more expressive topologies before the application of GNN models
for learning. In this work, we propose a structural lifting strategy using
Forman-Ricci curvature, which defines an edge-based network characteristic
based on Riemannian geometry. Curvature reveals local and global properties of
a graph, such as a network's backbones, i.e. coarse, structure-preserving graph
geometries that form connections between major communities - most suitably
represented as hyperedges to model information flows between clusters across
large distances in the network. To this end, our approach provides a remedy to
the problem of information distortion in message passing across long distances
and graph bottlenecks - a phenomenon known in graph learning as over-squashing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法整合SFT和RL时容易破坏模型模式并过拟合专家数据，需一种统一视角和动态调整方案。

Method: 提出CHORD框架，将SFT作为动态加权辅助目标融入RL，采用全局系数和令牌级权重函数协调学习和探索。

Result: 实验表明CHORD能稳定高效学习，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: CHORD成功协调专家数据和探索，为后续研究提供启发。

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) are two
prominent post-training paradigms for refining the capabilities and aligning
the behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing approaches that
integrate SFT and RL often face the risk of disrupting established model
patterns and inducing overfitting to expert data. To address this, we present a
novel investigation into the unified view of SFT and RL through an off-policy
versus on-policy lens. We propose CHORD, a framework for the Controllable
Harmonization of On- and Off-Policy Reinforcement Learning via Dynamic
Weighting, which reframes SFT not as a separate stage but as a dynamically
weighted auxiliary objective within the on-policy RL process. Based on an
analysis of off-policy expert data's influence at both holistic and granular
levels, we incorporate a dual-control mechanism in CHORD. Specifically, the
framework first employs a global coefficient to holistically guide the
transition from off-policy imitation to on-policy exploration, and then applies
a token-wise weighting function that enables granular learning from expert
tokens, which preserves on-policy exploration and mitigates disruption from
off-policy data. We conduct extensive experiments on widely used benchmarks,
providing empirical evidence that CHORD achieves a stable and efficient
learning process. By effectively harmonizing off-policy expert data with
on-policy exploration, CHORD demonstrates significant improvements over
baselines. We release the implementation at
https://github.com/modelscope/Trinity-RFT/tree/main/examples/mix_chord to
inspire further research.

Motivation: 现有方法在优化抗体互补决定区（CDRs）时效率低下，且无法同步设计序列和结构，LEAD旨在解决这些问题。

Method: LEAD在共享潜在空间中优化序列和结构，并采用黑盒指导策略处理非可微分的属性评估器。

Result: 实验表明，LEAD在单目标和多目标优化中表现优异，查询消耗减少一半，且性能优于基线方法。

Conclusion: LEAD通过潜在空间优化和黑盒策略，显著提高了抗体设计的效率和性能。

Abstract: Advancements in deep generative models have enabled the joint modeling of
antibody sequence and structure, given the antigen-antibody complex as context.
However, existing approaches for optimizing complementarity-determining regions
(CDRs) to improve developability properties operate in the raw data space,
leading to excessively costly evaluations due to the inefficient search
process. To address this, we propose LatEnt blAck-box Design (LEAD), a
sequence-structure co-design framework that optimizes both sequence and
structure within their shared latent space. Optimizing shared latent codes can
not only break through the limitations of existing methods, but also ensure
synchronization of different modality designs. Particularly, we design a
black-box guidance strategy to accommodate real-world scenarios where many
property evaluators are non-differentiable. Experimental results demonstrate
that our LEAD achieves superior optimization performance for both single and
multi-property objectives. Notably, LEAD reduces query consumption by a half
while surpassing baseline methods in property optimization. The code is
available at https://github.com/EvaFlower/LatEnt-blAck-box-Design.

Result: 在MNIST和FashionMNIST数据集上验证了方法对噪声和攻击的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 收缩性NODEs能有效提升模型鲁棒性，且正则化方法计算高效。

Abstract: Neural networks can be fragile to input noise and adversarial attacks.
  In this work, we consider Convolutional Neural Ordinary Differential
Equations (NODEs), a family of continuous-depth neural networks represented by
dynamical systems, and propose to use contraction theory to improve their
robustness.
  For a contractive dynamical system two trajectories starting from different
initial conditions converge to each other exponentially fast.
  Contractive Convolutional NODEs can enjoy increased robustness as slight
perturbations of the features do not cause a significant change in the output.
  Contractivity can be induced during training by using a regularization term
involving the Jacobian of the system dynamics.
  To reduce the computational burden, we show that it can also be promoted
using carefully selected weight regularization terms for a class of NODEs with
slope-restricted activation functions.
  The performance of the proposed regularizers is illustrated through benchmark
image classification tasks on MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets, where images are
corrupted by different kinds of noise and attacks.

Abstract: The generation of connectional brain templates (CBTs) has recently garnered
significant attention for its potential to identify unique connectivity
patterns shared across individuals. However, existing methods for CBT learning
such as conventional machine learning and graph neural networks (GNNs) are
hindered by several limitations. These include: (i) poor interpretability due
to their black-box nature, (ii) high computational cost, and (iii) an exclusive
focus on structure and topology, overlooking the cognitive capacity of the
generated CBT. To address these challenges, we introduce mCOCO (multi-sensory
COgnitive COmputing), a novel framework that leverages Reservoir Computing (RC)
to learn population-level functional CBT from BOLD
(Blood-Oxygen-level-Dependent) signals. RC's dynamic system properties allow
for tracking state changes over time, enhancing interpretability and enabling
the modeling of brain-like dynamics, as demonstrated in prior literature. By
integrating multi-sensory inputs (e.g., text, audio, and visual data), mCOCO
captures not only structure and topology but also how brain regions process
information and adapt to cognitive tasks such as sensory processing, all in a
computationally efficient manner. Our mCOCO framework consists of two phases:
(1) mapping BOLD signals into the reservoir to derive individual functional
connectomes, which are then aggregated into a group-level CBT - an approach, to
the best of our knowledge, not previously explored in functional connectivity
studies - and (2) incorporating multi-sensory inputs through a cognitive
reservoir, endowing the CBT with cognitive traits. Extensive evaluations show
that our mCOCO-based template significantly outperforms GNN-based CBT in terms
of centeredness, discriminativeness, topological soundness, and multi-sensory
memory retention. Our source code is available at

Conclusion: 结论指出，解释算法需修改才能具备信息性，这对AI审计、监管和高风险应用具有重要实践意义。

Abstract: Many researchers have suggested that local post-hoc explanation algorithms
can be used to gain insights into the behavior of complex machine learning
models. However, theoretical guarantees about such algorithms only exist for
simple decision functions, and it is unclear whether and under which
assumptions similar results might exist for complex models. In this paper, we
introduce a general, learning-theory-based framework for what it means for an
explanation to provide information about a decision function. We call an
explanation informative if it serves to reduce the complexity of the space of
plausible decision functions. With this approach, we show that many popular
explanation algorithms are not informative when applied to complex decision
functions, providing a rigorous mathematical rejection of the idea that it
should be possible to explain any model. We then derive conditions under which
different explanation algorithms become informative. These are often stronger
than what one might expect. For example, gradient explanations and
counterfactual explanations are non-informative with respect to the space of
differentiable functions, and SHAP and anchor explanations are not informative
with respect to the space of decision trees. Based on these results, we discuss
how explanation algorithms can be modified to become informative. While the
proposed analysis of explanation algorithms is mathematical, we argue that it
holds strong implications for the practical applicability of these algorithms,
particularly for auditing, regulation, and high-risk applications of AI.

Abstract: Rigorous statistical methods, including parameter estimation with
accompanying uncertainties, underpin the validity of scientific discovery,
especially in the natural sciences. With increasingly complex data models such
as deep learning techniques, uncertainty quantification has become exceedingly
difficult and a plethora of techniques have been proposed. In this case study,
we use the unifying framework of approximate Bayesian inference combined with
empirical tests on carefully created synthetic classification datasets to
investigate qualitative properties of six different probabilistic machine
learning algorithms for class probability and uncertainty estimation: (i) a
neural network ensemble, (ii) neural network ensemble with conflictual loss,
(iii) evidential deep learning, (iv) a single neural network with Monte Carlo
Dropout, (v) Gaussian process classification and (vi) a Dirichlet process
mixture model. We check if the algorithms produce uncertainty estimates which
reflect commonly desired properties, such as being well calibrated and
exhibiting an increase in uncertainty for out-of-distribution data points. Our
results indicate that all algorithms are well calibrated, but none of the deep
learning based algorithms provide uncertainties that consistently reflect lack
of experimental evidence for out-of-distribution data points. We hope our study
may serve as a clarifying example for researchers developing new methods of
uncertainty estimation for scientific data-driven modeling.

Abstract: Motor vehicle crashes remain a leading cause of injury and death worldwide,
necessitating data-driven approaches to understand and mitigate crash severity.
This study introduces a curated dataset of more than 3 million people involved
in accidents in Ohio over six years (2017-2022), aggregated to more than 2.3
million vehicle-level records for predictive analysis. The primary contribution
is a transparent and reproducible methodology that combines Automated Machine
Learning (AutoML) and explainable artificial intelligence (AI) to identify and
interpret key risk factors associated with severe crashes. Using the JADBio
AutoML platform, predictive models were constructed to distinguish between
severe and non-severe crash outcomes. The models underwent rigorous feature
selection across stratified training subsets, and their outputs were
interpreted using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to quantify the
contribution of individual features. A final Ridge Logistic Regression model
achieved an AUC-ROC of 85.6% on the training set and 84.9% on a hold-out test
set, with 17 features consistently identified as the most influential
predictors. Key features spanned demographic, environmental, vehicle, human,
and operational categories, including location type, posted speed, minimum
occupant age, and pre-crash action. Notably, certain traditionally emphasized
factors, such as alcohol or drug impairment, were less influential in the final
model compared to environmental and contextual variables. Emphasizing
methodological rigor and interpretability over mere predictive performance,
this study offers a scalable framework to support Vision Zero with aligned
interventions and advanced data-informed traffic safety policy.

self-explainable GNNs that generate explanations as part of training, improving
both faithfulness and efficiency. Some of these models, such as ProtGNN and
PGIB, learn class-specific prototypes, offering a potential pathway toward
class-level explanations. However, their evaluations focus solely on
instance-level explanations, leaving open the question of whether these
prototypes meaningfully generalize across instances of the same class. In this
paper, we introduce GraphOracle, a novel self-explainable GNN framework
designed to generate and evaluate class-level explanations for GNNs. Our model
jointly learns a GNN classifier and a set of structured, sparse subgraphs that
are discriminative for each class. We propose a novel integrated training that
captures graph$\unicode{x2013}$subgraph$\unicode{x2013}$prediction dependencies
efficiently and faithfully, validated through a masking-based evaluation
strategy. This strategy enables us to retroactively assess whether prior
methods like ProtGNN and PGIB deliver effective class-level explanations. Our
results show that they do not. In contrast, GraphOracle achieves superior
fidelity, explainability, and scalability across a range of graph
classification tasks. We further demonstrate that GraphOracle avoids the
computational bottlenecks of previous methods$\unicode{x2014}$like Monte Carlo
Tree Search$\unicode{x2014}$by using entropy-regularized subgraph selection and
lightweight random walk extraction, enabling faster and more scalable training.
These findings position GraphOracle as a practical and principled solution for
faithful class-level self-explainability in GNNs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种双空间引导的测试框架，通过协调场景参数空间和智能体行为空间，平衡多样性和关键性，以生成更优的测试场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态环境中决策代理的广泛部署增加了对安全验证的需求，现有方法在高维场景空间中难以平衡多样性和关键性。

Method: 采用分层表示框架，结合降维和多维子空间评估，动态协调局部扰动和全局探索两种生成模式，并利用智能体行为空间数据形成反馈闭环。

Result: 实验表明，该框架在五种决策代理上平均提高了56.23%的关键场景生成效率，并在新指标下表现出更高的多样性。

Conclusion: 双空间引导框架有效解决了高维场景空间中的局部最优问题，显著提升了测试场景的多样性和关键性。

Abstract: The growing deployment of decision-making agents in dynamic environments
increases the demand for safety verification. While critical testing scenario
generation has emerged as an appealing verification methodology, effectively
balancing diversity and criticality remains a key challenge for existing
methods, particularly due to local optima entrapment in high-dimensional
scenario spaces. To address this limitation, we propose a dual-space guided
testing framework that coordinates scenario parameter space and agent behavior
space, aiming to generate testing scenarios considering diversity and
criticality. Specifically, in the scenario parameter space, a hierarchical
representation framework combines dimensionality reduction and
multi-dimensional subspace evaluation to efficiently localize diverse and
critical subspaces. This guides dynamic coordination between two generation
modes: local perturbation and global exploration, optimizing critical scenario
quantity and diversity. Complementarily, in the agent behavior space,
agent-environment interaction data are leveraged to quantify behavioral
criticality/diversity and adaptively support generation mode switching, forming
a closed feedback loop that continuously enhances scenario characterization and
exploration within the parameter space. Experiments show our framework improves
critical scenario generation by an average of 56.23\% and demonstrates greater
diversity under novel parameter-behavior co-driven metrics when tested on five
decision-making agents, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

*Max Guillen,Philipp Misof,Jan E. Gerken*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用费曼图计算有限宽度修正的方法，以解决无限宽度下NTK无法捕捉训练动态的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无限宽度下的NTK无法反映训练中的特征学习或NTK演化等关键特性，因此需要引入有限宽度修正。

Method: 通过费曼图计算有限宽度修正，简化代数操作，并推导出涉及预激活、NTK及其高阶张量的层间递归关系。

Result: 验证了深度网络的稳定性结果，并证明ReLU等尺度不变非线性在NTK Gram矩阵对角线上无有限宽度修正。

Conclusion: 该方法为有限宽度下的NTK统计提供了有效工具，并通过数值实验验证了其可行性。

Abstract: Neural tangent kernels (NTKs) are a powerful tool for analyzing deep,
non-linear neural networks. In the infinite-width limit, NTKs can easily be
computed for most common architectures, yielding full analytic control over the
training dynamics. However, at infinite width, important properties of training
such as NTK evolution or feature learning are absent. Nevertheless, finite
width effects can be included by computing corrections to the Gaussian
statistics at infinite width. We introduce Feynman diagrams for computing
finite-width corrections to NTK statistics. These dramatically simplify the
necessary algebraic manipulations and enable the computation of layer-wise
recursive relations for arbitrary statistics involving preactivations, NTKs and
certain higher-derivative tensors (dNTK and ddNTK) required to predict the
training dynamics at leading order. We demonstrate the feasibility of our
framework by extending stability results for deep networks from preactivations
to NTKs and proving the absence of finite-width corrections for scale-invariant
nonlinearities such as ReLU on the diagonal of the Gram matrix of the NTK. We
validate our results with numerical experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在时间序列领域已证明有效，但如何结合物理信息提升异常检测性能仍需探索。

Method: 使用加权物理信息损失训练扩散模型，学习物理依赖的时间分布。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在异常检测中提高了F1分数，生成数据多样性和对数似然性更好，优于基线和其他模型。

Conclusion: 物理信息训练显著提升了扩散模型在异常检测中的表现，尤其在合成和部分真实数据集上表现突出。

Abstract: We propose an unsupervised anomaly detection approach based on a
physics-informed diffusion model for multivariate time series data. Over the
past years, diffusion model has demonstrated its effectiveness in forecasting,
imputation, generation, and anomaly detection in the time series domain. In
this paper, we present a new approach for learning the physics-dependent
temporal distribution of multivariate time series data using a weighted
physics-informed loss during diffusion model training. A weighted
physics-informed loss is constructed using a static weight schedule. This
approach enables a diffusion model to accurately approximate underlying data
distribution, which can influence the unsupervised anomaly detection
performance. Our experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that
physics-informed training improves the F1 score in anomaly detection; it
generates better data diversity and log-likelihood. Our model outperforms
baseline approaches, additionally, it surpasses prior physics-informed work and
purely data-driven diffusion models on a synthetic dataset and one real-world
dataset while remaining competitive on others.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为HXAI的全面可解释人工智能框架，旨在通过嵌入解释到数据分析的每个阶段，提升用户对AI模型的信任和理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI模型被视为‘黑盒’，传统解释方法仅关注单个预测，忽略了上下游决策和质量检查，导致用户难以信任AI的洞察。

Method: HXAI框架整合了六个组件（数据、分析设置、学习过程、模型输出、模型质量、沟通渠道），并通过112个问题库和用户调查，结合人类解释理论、人机交互原则和实证研究，设计清晰、可操作的解释。

Result: HXAI提供了一个全面的分类法，减少了术语歧义，并展示了如何利用大语言模型协调多种解释技术，生成针对不同利益相关者的叙述。

Conclusion: HXAI通过跨学科融合和实际项目经验，提出了一种端到端的透明、可信赖和负责任AI部署的新视角。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is reshaping science and industry, yet many users
still regard its models as opaque "black boxes". Conventional explainable
artificial-intelligence methods clarify individual predictions but overlook the
upstream decisions and downstream quality checks that determine whether
insights can be trusted. In this work, we present Holistic Explainable
Artificial Intelligence (HXAI), a user-centric framework that embeds
explanation into every stage of the data-analysis workflow and tailors those
explanations to users. HXAI unifies six components (data, analysis set-up,
learning process, model output, model quality, communication channel) into a
single taxonomy and aligns each component with the needs of domain experts,
data analysts and data scientists. A 112-item question bank covers these needs;
our survey of contemporary tools highlights critical coverage gaps. Grounded in
theories of human explanation, principles from human-computer interaction and
findings from empirical user studies, HXAI identifies the characteristics that
make explanations clear, actionable and cognitively manageable. A comprehensive
taxonomy operationalises these insights, reducing terminological ambiguity and
enabling rigorous coverage analysis of existing toolchains. We further
demonstrate how AI agents that embed large-language models can orchestrate
diverse explanation techniques, translating technical artifacts into
stakeholder-specific narratives that bridge the gap between AI developers and
domain experts. Departing from traditional surveys or perspective articles,
this work melds concepts from multiple disciplines, lessons from real-world
projects and a critical synthesis of the literature to advance a novel,
end-to-end viewpoint on transparency, trustworthiness and responsible AI
deployment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DFed-SST是一种去中心化的联邦图学习框架，通过自适应通信机制解决了现有方法在局部子图拓扑信息处理上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去中心化联邦学习（DFL）方法未能充分利用局部子图的拓扑信息，而联邦图学习（FGL）又依赖中心化架构。

Method: 提出DFed-SST框架，采用双拓扑自适应通信机制，动态优化客户端间的通信拓扑。

Result: 在八个真实数据集上，DFed-SST平均准确率比基线方法提高了3.26%。

Conclusion: DFed-SST有效解决了异构性问题，提升了去中心化联邦图学习的性能。

Abstract: Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) has emerged as a robust distributed
paradigm that circumvents the single-point-of-failure and communication
bottleneck risks of centralized architectures. However, a significant challenge
arises as existing DFL optimization strategies, primarily designed for tasks
such as computer vision, fail to address the unique topological information
inherent in the local subgraph. Notably, while Federated Graph Learning (FGL)
is tailored for graph data, it is predominantly implemented in a centralized
server-client model, failing to leverage the benefits of decentralization.To
bridge this gap, we propose DFed-SST, a decentralized federated graph learning
framework with adaptive communication. The core of our method is a
dual-topology adaptive communication mechanism that leverages the unique
topological features of each client's local subgraph to dynamically construct
and optimize the inter-client communication topology. This allows our framework
to guide model aggregation efficiently in the face of heterogeneity. Extensive
experiments on eight real-world datasets consistently demonstrate the
superiority of DFed-SST, achieving 3.26% improvement in average accuracy over
baseline methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于数据驱动的嵌套算子推断（OpInf）方法，用于从高维动态系统的快照数据中学习物理信息降阶模型（ROM）。该方法通过利用降阶空间中的层次结构，优先考虑主导模式的交互作用，从而在标准OpInf基础上显著降低误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维动态系统的建模和仿真通常计算成本高昂，因此需要高效的降阶模型（ROM）。传统OpInf方法在初始猜测和模型更新方面存在局限性，嵌套OpInf方法旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 提出嵌套OpInf算法，通过利用降阶空间的层次结构，迭代构建初始猜测，优先考虑主导模式的交互作用。算法支持动态基和模型形式的更新。

Result: 在立方热传导问题中，嵌套OpInf的误差比标准OpInf小四倍，计算时间相近。在大规模参数化的格陵兰冰盖模型中，平均误差为3%，计算加速因子超过19,000。

Conclusion: 嵌套OpInf方法在降低误差和计算成本方面表现出色，适用于动态基和模型更新的场景，为高维动态系统的建模提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a data-driven, nested Operator Inference (OpInf) approach
for learning physics-informed reduced-order models (ROMs) from snapshot data of
high-dimensional dynamical systems. The approach exploits the inherent
hierarchy within the reduced space to iteratively construct initial guesses for
the OpInf learning problem that prioritize the interactions of the dominant
modes. The initial guess computed for any target reduced dimension corresponds
to a ROM with provably smaller or equal snapshot reconstruction error than with
standard OpInf. Moreover, our nested OpInf algorithm can be warm-started from
previously learned models, enabling versatile application scenarios involving
dynamic basis and model form updates. We demonstrate the performance of our
algorithm on a cubic heat conduction problem, with nested OpInf achieving a
four times smaller error than standard OpInf at a comparable offline time.
Further, we apply nested OpInf to a large-scale, parameterized model of the
Greenland ice sheet where, despite model form approximation errors, it learns a
ROM with, on average, 3% error and computational speed-up factor above 19,000.

TL;DR: SeamlessFlow是一个基于服务器的强化学习框架，解决了工业规模RL中的两个核心挑战：解耦训练与复杂执行流，以及最大化GPU利用率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业规模RL中，训练与执行流耦合及GPU利用率低是主要问题。

Method: 提出数据平面解耦RL训练与代理执行，并引入标签驱动调度和时空复用管道。

Result: 实现了稳定性和高性能，适用于多代理和复杂RL任务。

Conclusion: SeamlessFlow适合大规模RL部署，解决了关键挑战。

Abstract: We introduce SeamlessFlow, a server based reinforcement learning (RL)
framework that addresses two core challenges in industrial scale RL: (1)
decoupling RL training from the complex execution flow of agents; (2)
maximizing GPU utilization with minimal idle time while preserving the
stability and scalability required for large-scale deployments. First,
SeamlessFlow introduces a data plane that decouples the RL trainer from
diverse, complex agent implementations while sustaining high throughput. A
central trajectory manager maintains complete interaction histories and
supports partial rollout, allowing rollout to pause for weight updates and
resume seamlessly, keeping agents unaware of service interruptions. Second, we
propose a tag driven scheduling paradigm that abstracts hardware into
capability tagged resources, unifying colocated and disaggregated
architectures. Based on this, SeamlessFlow introduces a spatiotemporal
multiplexing pipeline that dynamically reassigns idle training nodes to rollout
in a train rollout separated setup, eliminating pipeline bubbles and fully
exploiting heterogeneous cluster resources. By combining these innovations,
SeamlessFlow delivers both stability and high performance, making it well
suited for multi agent, long horizon, and other complex RL tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于马尔可夫游戏的框架，用于定量研究不同联盟结构如何影响碳捕集与封存（CCS）项目中各利益相关者的目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CCS项目涉及多方利益相关者，各自目标不同且地质条件复杂，如何协调合作或独立优化是一个关键问题。

Method: 采用多智能体强化学习方法，结合安全约束，利用基于E2C框架的替代模型降低计算成本。

Result: 框架有效解决了多利益相关者、多目标下的CO2封存优化管理问题。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为CCS项目的协作管理提供了定量分析工具，有助于实现多方共赢。

Abstract: Carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects typically involve a diverse array
of stakeholders or players from public, private, and regulatory sectors, each
with different objectives and responsibilities. Given the complexity, scale,
and long-term nature of CCS operations, determining whether individual
stakeholders can independently maximize their interests or whether
collaborative coalition agreements are needed remains a central question for
effective CCS project planning and management. CCS projects are often
implemented in geologically connected sites, where shared geological features
such as pressure space and reservoir pore capacity can lead to competitive
behavior among stakeholders. Furthermore, CO2 storage sites are often located
in geologically mature basins that previously served as sites for hydrocarbon
extraction or wastewater disposal in order to leverage existing
infrastructures, which makes unilateral optimization even more complicated and
unrealistic.
  In this work, we propose a paradigm based on Markov games to quantitatively
investigate how different coalition structures affect the goals of
stakeholders. We frame this multi-stakeholder multi-site problem as a
multi-agent reinforcement learning problem with safety constraints. Our
approach enables agents to learn optimal strategies while compliant with safety
regulations. We present an example where multiple operators are injecting CO2
into their respective project areas in a geologically connected basin. To
address the high computational cost of repeated simulations of high-fidelity
models, a previously developed surrogate model based on the Embed-to-Control
(E2C) framework is employed. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed framework in addressing optimal management of CO2 storage when
multiple stakeholders with various objectives and goals are involved.

Motivation: 解决当前MAS设计中策略自主性不足及协作效率与监督之间的平衡问题。

Method: 重新定义MAS的基本执行单元，构建四层状态架构（任务、阶段、智能体、步骤）以实现拓扑优化和可控进度的统一。

Result: Allen实现了前所未有的策略自主性，并在协作结构的可控性上取得平衡。

Conclusion: Allen为复杂网络拓扑中的MAS设计提供了新的解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: We introduce a new Multi-Agent System (MAS) - Allen, designed to address two
core challenges in current MAS design: (1) improve system's policy autonomy,
empowering agents to dynamically adapt their behavioral strategies, and (2)
achieving the trade-off between collaborative efficiency, task supervision, and
human oversight in complex network topologies.
  Our core insight is to redefine the basic execution unit in the MAS, allowing
agents to autonomously form different patterns by combining these units. We
have constructed a four-tier state architecture (Task, Stage, Agent, Step) to
constrain system behavior from both task-oriented and execution-oriented
perspectives. This achieves a unification of topological optimization and
controllable progress.
  Allen grants unprecedented Policy Autonomy, while making a trade-off for the
controllability of the collaborative structure. The project code has been open

Result: 在80个真实城市数据上的实验表明，S2D2优于贪婪启发式方法，并在某些假设下输出近似强Stackelberg均衡。

Conclusion: S2D2算法在防御多无人机攻击中表现出高效性和优越性，适用于实际城市防御场景。

Abstract: To counter an imminent multi-drone attack on a city, defenders have deployed
drones across the city. These drones must intercept/eliminate the threat, thus
reducing potential damage from the attack. We model this as a Sequential
Stackelberg Security Game, where the defender first commits to a mixed
sequential defense strategy, and the attacker then best responds. We develop an
efficient algorithm called S2D2, which outputs a defense strategy. We
demonstrate the efficacy of S2D2 in extensive experiments on data from 80 real
cities, improving the performance of the defender in comparison to greedy
heuristics based on prior works. We prove that under some reasonable
assumptions about the city structure, S2D2 outputs an approximate Strong
Stackelberg Equilibrium (SSE) with a convenient structure.

Result: 在自主DDoS防御和群体智能形成控制实验中，TAPA表现出色，分别实现了77.7%的网络正常运行时间和稳定的共识保持。

Conclusion: TAPA为动态环境中的自主系统设计提供了新范式，从策略适应转向动态动作适应。

Abstract: Autonomous agents in safety-critical applications must continuously adapt to
dynamic conditions without compromising performance and reliability. This work
introduces TAPA (Training-free Adaptation of Programmatic Agents), a novel
framework that positions large language models (LLMs) as intelligent moderators
of the symbolic action space. Unlike prior programmatic agents that typically
generate a monolithic policy program or rely on fixed symbolic action sets,
TAPA synthesizes and adapts modular programs for individual high-level actions,
referred to as logical primitives. By decoupling strategic intent from
execution, TAPA enables meta-agents to operate over an abstract, interpretable
action space while the LLM dynamically generates, composes, and refines
symbolic programs tailored to each primitive. Extensive experiments across
cybersecurity and swarm intelligence domains validate TAPA's effectiveness. In
autonomous DDoS defense scenarios, TAPA achieves 77.7% network uptime while
maintaining near-perfect detection accuracy in unknown dynamic environments. In
swarm intelligence formation control under environmental and adversarial
disturbances, TAPA consistently preserves consensus at runtime where baseline
methods fail completely. This work promotes a paradigm shift for autonomous
system design in evolving environments, from policy adaptation to dynamic
action adaptation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示当前VideoLLMs在处理视频时忽略有害内容的安全漏洞，并分析其根本原因。

Method: 通过根因分析发现三个设计缺陷，并设计三种零查询黑盒攻击进行验证。

Result: 实验表明，主流VideoLLMs在90%以上的情况下会忽略有害内容。

Conclusion: 当前VideoLLMs的设计存在根本性漏洞，需改进采样策略、压缩和解码机制以确保语义覆盖。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) are increasingly deployed on numerous
critical applications, where users rely on auto-generated summaries while
casually skimming the video stream. We show that this interaction hides a
critical safety gap: if harmful content is embedded in a video, either as
full-frame inserts or as small corner patches, state-of-the-art VideoLLMs
rarely mention the harmful content in the output, despite its clear visibility
to human viewers. A root-cause analysis reveals three compounding design flaws:
(1) insufficient temporal coverage resulting from the sparse, uniformly spaced
frame sampling used by most leading VideoLLMs, (2) spatial information loss
introduced by aggressive token downsampling within sampled frames, and (3)
encoder-decoder disconnection, whereby visual cues are only weakly utilized
during text generation. Leveraging these insights, we craft three zero-query
black-box attacks, aligning with these flaws in the processing pipeline. Our
large-scale evaluation across five leading VideoLLMs shows that the harmfulness
omission rate exceeds 90% in most cases. Even when harmful content is clearly
present in all frames, these models consistently fail to identify it. These
results underscore a fundamental vulnerability in current VideoLLMs' designs
and highlight the urgent need for sampling strategies, token compression, and
decoding mechanisms that guarantee semantic coverage rather than speed alone.

Abstract: The development of porous polymeric membranes remains a labor-intensive
process, often requiring extensive trial and error to identify optimal
fabrication parameters. In this study, we present a fully automated platform
for membrane fabrication and characterization via nonsolvent-induced phase
separation (NIPS). The system integrates automated solution preparation, blade
casting, controlled immersion, and compression testing, allowing precise
control over fabrication parameters such as polymer concentration and ambient
humidity. The modular design allows parallel processing and reproducible
handling of samples, reducing experimental time and increasing consistency.
Compression testing is introduced as a sensitive mechanical characterization
method for estimating membrane stiffness and as a proxy to infer porosity and
intra-sample uniformity through automated analysis of stress-strain curves. As
a proof of concept to demonstrate the effectiveness of the system, NIPS was
carried out with polysulfone, the green solvent PolarClean, and water as the
polymer, solvent, and nonsolvent, respectively. Experiments conducted with the
automated system reproduced expected effects of polymer concentration and
ambient humidity on membrane properties, namely increased stiffness and
uniformity with increasing polymer concentration and humidity variations in
pore morphology and mechanical response. The developed automated platform
supports high-throughput experimentation and is well-suited for integration
into self-driving laboratory workflows, offering a scalable and reproducible
foundation for data-driven optimization of porous polymeric membranes through
NIPS.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel robust online calibration framework for
Ultra-Wideband (UWB) anchors in UWB-aided Visual-Inertial Navigation Systems
(VINS). Accurate anchor positioning, a process known as calibration, is crucial
for integrating UWB ranging measurements into state estimation. While several
prior works have demonstrated satisfactory results by using robot-aided systems
to autonomously calibrate UWB systems, there are still some limitations: 1)
these approaches assume accurate robot localization during the initialization
step, ignoring localization errors that can compromise calibration robustness,
and 2) the calibration results are highly sensitive to the initial guess of the
UWB anchors' positions, reducing the practical applicability of these methods
in real-world scenarios. Our approach addresses these challenges by explicitly
incorporating the impact of robot localization uncertainties into the
calibration process, ensuring robust initialization. To further enhance the
robustness of the calibration results against initialization errors, we propose
a tightly-coupled Schmidt Kalman Filter (SKF)-based online refinement method,
making the system suitable for practical applications. Simulations and
real-world experiments validate the improved accuracy and robustness of our
approach.

Abstract: We present 3D FlowMatch Actor (3DFA), a 3D policy architecture for robot
manipulation that combines flow matching for trajectory prediction with 3D
pretrained visual scene representations for learning from demonstration. 3DFA
leverages 3D relative attention between action and visual tokens during action
denoising, building on prior work in 3D diffusion-based single-arm policy
learning. Through a combination of flow matching and targeted system-level and
architectural optimizations, 3DFA achieves over 30x faster training and
inference than previous 3D diffusion-based policies, without sacrificing
performance. On the bimanual PerAct2 benchmark, it establishes a new state of
the art, outperforming the next-best method by an absolute margin of 41.4%. In
extensive real-world evaluations, it surpasses strong baselines with up to
1000x more parameters and significantly more pretraining. In unimanual
settings, it sets a new state of the art on 74 RLBench tasks by directly
predicting dense end-effector trajectories, eliminating the need for motion
planning. Comprehensive ablation studies underscore the importance of our
design choices for both policy effectiveness and efficiency.

Abstract: Recent advances have shown that video generation models can enhance robot
learning by deriving effective robot actions through inverse dynamics. However,
these methods heavily depend on the quality of generated data and struggle with
fine-grained manipulation due to the lack of environment feedback. While
video-based reinforcement learning improves policy robustness, it remains
constrained by the uncertainty of video generation and the challenges of
collecting large-scale robot datasets for training diffusion models. To address
these limitations, we propose GenFlowRL, which derives shaped rewards from
generated flow trained from diverse cross-embodiment datasets. This enables
learning generalizable and robust policies from diverse demonstrations using
low-dimensional, object-centric features. Experiments on 10 manipulation tasks,
both in simulation and real-world cross-embodiment evaluations, demonstrate
that GenFlowRL effectively leverages manipulation features extracted from
generated object-centric flow, consistently achieving superior performance
across diverse and challenging scenarios. Our Project Page:

Conclusion: 未来工作将在Isaac Sim中评估系统，重点关注实时辅助能力。

Abstract: Human-robot collaboration requires robots to quickly infer user intent,
provide transparent reasoning, and assist users in achieving their goals. Our
recent work introduced GUIDER, our framework for inferring navigation and
manipulation intents. We propose augmenting GUIDER with a vision-language model
(VLM) and a text-only language model (LLM) to form a semantic prior that
filters objects and locations based on the mission prompt. A vision pipeline
(YOLO for object detection and the Segment Anything Model for instance
segmentation) feeds candidate object crops into the VLM, which scores their
relevance given an operator prompt; in addition, the list of detected object
labels is ranked by a text-only LLM. These scores weight the existing
navigation and manipulation layers of GUIDER, selecting context-relevant
targets while suppressing unrelated objects. Once the combined belief exceeds a
threshold, autonomy changes occur, enabling the robot to navigate to the
desired area and retrieve the desired object, while adapting to any changes in
the operator's intent. Future work will evaluate the system on Isaac Sim using
a Franka Emika arm on a Ridgeback base, with a focus on real-time assistance.

policies for the goal of sim-to-real policy transfer. We propose 1) utilizing
high visual-fidelity simulation for improved sim-to-real transfer, 2)
evaluating policies by systematically increasing task complexity and scenario
perturbation to assess robustness, and 3) quantifying performance alignment
between real-world performance and its simulation counterparts.

Conclusion: 该方法为腿式机器人在复杂环境中的安全导航提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous navigation through unstructured and dynamically-changing
environments is a complex task that continues to present many challenges for
modern roboticists. In particular, legged robots typically possess manipulable
asymmetric geometries which must be considered during safety-critical
trajectory planning. This work proposes a predictive safety filter: a nonlinear
model predictive control (MPC) algorithm for online trajectory generation with
geometry-aware safety constraints based on control barrier functions (CBFs).
Critically, our method leverages Poisson safety functions to numerically
synthesize CBF constraints directly from perception data. We extend the
theoretical framework for Poisson safety functions to incorporate temporal
changes in the domain by reformulating the static Dirichlet problem for
Poisson's equation as a parameterized moving boundary value problem.
Furthermore, we employ Minkowski set operations to lift the domain into a
configuration space that accounts for robot geometry. Finally, we implement our
real-time predictive safety filter on humanoid and quadruped robots in various
safety-critical scenarios. The results highlight the versatility of Poisson
safety functions, as well as the benefit of CBF constrained model predictive
safety-critical controllers.

Motivation: 现有强化学习方法在长时程机器人操作任务中表现不佳，尤其是稀疏奖励场景。直接学习连续动作块存在稳定性和数据效率的挑战。

Result: 在BiGym和RLBench的25个任务中，AC3仅需少量演示和简单架构即实现高成功率。

Conclusion: AC3通过稳定机制和数据高效设计，显著提升了长时程机器人操作任务的性能。

Abstract: Existing reinforcement learning (RL) methods struggle with long-horizon
robotic manipulation tasks, particularly those involving sparse rewards. While
action chunking is a promising paradigm for robotic manipulation, using RL to
directly learn continuous action chunks in a stable and data-efficient manner
remains a critical challenge. This paper introduces AC3 (Actor-Critic for
Continuous Chunks), a novel RL framework that learns to generate
high-dimensional, continuous action sequences. To make this learning process
stable and data-efficient, AC3 incorporates targeted stabilization mechanisms
for both the actor and the critic. First, to ensure reliable policy
improvement, the actor is trained with an asymmetric update rule, learning
exclusively from successful trajectories. Second, to enable effective value
learning despite sparse rewards, the critic's update is stabilized using
intra-chunk $n$-step returns and further enriched by a self-supervised module
providing intrinsic rewards at anchor points aligned with each action chunk. We
conducted extensive experiments on 25 tasks from the BiGym and RLBench
benchmarks. Results show that by using only a few demonstrations and a simple
model architecture, AC3 achieves superior success rates on most tasks,
validating its effective design.

Abstract: Grasping is a fundamental task in robot-assisted surgery (RAS), and
automating it can reduce surgeon workload while enhancing efficiency, safety,
and consistency beyond teleoperated systems. Most prior approaches rely on
explicit object pose tracking or handcrafted visual features, limiting their
generalization to novel objects, robustness to visual disturbances, and the
ability to handle deformable objects. Visuomotor learning offers a promising
alternative, but deploying it in RAS presents unique challenges, such as low
signal-to-noise ratio in visual observations, demands for high safety and
millimeter-level precision, as well as the complex surgical environment. This
paper addresses three key challenges: (i) sim-to-real transfer of visuomotor
policies to ex vivo surgical scenes, (ii) visuomotor learning using only a
single stereo camera pair -- the standard RAS setup, and (iii) object-agnostic
grasping with a single policy that generalizes to diverse, unseen surgical
objects without retraining or task-specific models. We introduce Grasp Anything
for Surgery V2 (GASv2), a visuomotor learning framework for surgical grasping.
GASv2 leverages a world-model-based architecture and a surgical perception
pipeline for visual observations, combined with a hybrid control system for
safe execution. We train the policy in simulation using domain randomization
for sim-to-real transfer and deploy it on a real robot in both phantom-based
and ex vivo surgical settings, using only a single pair of endoscopic cameras.
Extensive experiments show our policy achieves a 65% success rate in both
settings, generalizes to unseen objects and grippers, and adapts to diverse
disturbances, demonstrating strong performance, generality, and robustness.

Conclusion: 非等距对称性结构和MEA方法为视觉运动学习提供了更高效的解决方案，扩展了对称性在机器人操作中的应用潜力。

Abstract: Sampling efficiency is critical for deploying visuomotor learning in
real-world robotic manipulation. While task symmetry has emerged as a promising
inductive bias to improve efficiency, most prior work is limited to isometric
symmetries -- applying the same group transformation to all task objects across
all timesteps. In this work, we explore non-isometric symmetries, applying
multiple independent group transformations across spatial and temporal
dimensions to relax these constraints. We introduce a novel formulation of the
partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) that incorporates the
non-isometric symmetry structures, and propose a simple yet effective data
augmentation method, Multi-Group Equivariance Augmentation (MEA). We integrate
MEA with offline reinforcement learning to enhance sampling efficiency, and
introduce a voxel-based visual representation that preserves translational
equivariance. Extensive simulation and real-robot experiments across two
manipulation domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Conclusion: NEEI范式为具身AI提供了高效解决方案，联合优化方法展现了显著优势。

Abstract: Realizing embodied artificial intelligence is challenging due to the huge
computation demands of large models (LMs). To support LMs while ensuring
real-time inference, embodied edge intelligence (EEI) is a promising paradigm,
which leverages an LM edge to provide computing powers in close proximity to
embodied robots. Due to embodied data exchange, EEI requires higher spectral
efficiency, enhanced communication security, and reduced inter-user
interference. To meet these requirements, near-field communication (NFC), which
leverages extremely large antenna arrays as its hardware foundation, is an
ideal solution. Therefore, this paper advocates the integration of EEI and NFC,
resulting in a near-field EEI (NEEI) paradigm. However, NEEI also introduces
new challenges that cannot be adequately addressed by isolated EEI or NFC
designs, creating research opportunities for joint optimization of both
functionalities. To this end, we propose radio-friendly embodied planning for
EEI-assisted NFC scenarios and view-guided beam-focusing for NFC-assisted EEI
scenarios. We also elaborate how to realize resource-efficient NEEI through
opportunistic collaborative navigation. Experimental results are provided to
confirm the superiority of the proposed techniques compared with various
benchmarks.

Abstract: Robotics research has long sought to give robots the ability to perceive the
physical world through touch in an analogous manner to many biological systems.
Developing such tactile capabilities is important for numerous emerging
applications that require robots to co-exist and interact closely with humans.
Consequently, there has been growing interest in tactile sensing, leading to
the development of various technologies, including piezoresistive and
piezoelectric sensors, capacitive sensors, magnetic sensors, and optical
tactile sensors. These diverse approaches utilise different transduction
methods and materials to equip robots with distributed sensing capabilities,
enabling more effective physical interactions. These advances have been
supported in recent years by simulation tools that generate large-scale tactile
datasets to support sensor designs and algorithms to interpret and improve the
utility of tactile data. The integration of tactile sensing with other
modalities, such as vision, as well as with action strategies for active
tactile perception highlights the growing scope of this field. To further the
transformative progress in tactile robotics, a holistic approach is essential.
In this outlook article, we examine several challenges associated with the
current state of the art in tactile robotics and explore potential solutions to
inspire innovations across multiple domains, including manufacturing,
healthcare, recycling and agriculture.

Conclusion: 可微可达性地图为连续优化提供了有效约束，显著提升了运动规划效率。

Abstract: To reduce the computational cost of humanoid motion generation, we introduce
a new approach to representing robot kinematic reachability: the differentiable
reachability map. This map is a scalar-valued function defined in the task
space that takes positive values only in regions reachable by the robot's
end-effector. A key feature of this representation is that it is continuous and
differentiable with respect to task-space coordinates, enabling its direct use
as constraints in continuous optimization for humanoid motion planning. We
describe a method to learn such differentiable reachability maps from a set of
end-effector poses generated using a robot's kinematic model, using either a
neural network or a support vector machine as the learning model. By
incorporating the learned reachability map as a constraint, we formulate
humanoid motion generation as a continuous optimization problem. We demonstrate
that the proposed approach efficiently solves various motion planning problems,
including footstep planning, multi-contact motion planning, and
loco-manipulation planning for humanoid robots.

Conclusion: 主动重新规划框架通过场景图对比和轻量推理，有效预防执行失败，为机器人自主性提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: When humans perform everyday tasks, we naturally adjust our actions based on
the current state of the environment. For instance, if we intend to put
something into a drawer but notice it is closed, we open it first. However,
many autonomous robots lack this adaptive awareness. They often follow
pre-planned actions that may overlook subtle yet critical changes in the scene,
which can result in actions being executed under outdated assumptions and
eventual failure. While replanning is critical for robust autonomy, most
existing methods respond only after failures occur, when recovery may be
inefficient or infeasible. While proactive replanning holds promise for
preventing failures in advance, current solutions often rely on manually
designed rules and extensive supervision. In this work, we present a proactive
replanning framework that detects and corrects failures at subtask boundaries
by comparing scene graphs constructed from current RGB-D observations against
reference graphs extracted from successful demonstrations. When the current
scene fails to align with reference trajectories, a lightweight reasoning
module is activated to diagnose the mismatch and adjust the plan. Experiments
in the AI2-THOR simulator demonstrate that our approach detects semantic and
spatial mismatches before execution failures occur, significantly improving
task success and robustness.

Abstract: Bearing-only Target Motion Analysis (TMA) is a promising technique for
passive tracking in various applications as a bearing angle is easy to measure.
Despite its advantages, bearing-only TMA is challenging due to the nonlinearity
of the bearing measurement model and the lack of range information, which
impairs observability and estimator convergence. This paper addresses these
issues by proposing a Recursive Total Least Squares (RTLS) method for online
target localization and tracking using mobile observers. The RTLS approach,
inspired by previous results on Total Least Squares (TLS), mitigates biases in
position estimation and improves computational efficiency compared to
pseudo-linear Kalman filter (PLKF) methods. Additionally, we propose a
circumnavigation controller to enhance system observability and estimator
convergence by guiding the mobile observer in orbit around the target.
Extensive simulations and experiments are performed to demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. The proposed algorithm is
also compared with the state-of-the-art approaches, which confirms its superior
performance in terms of both accuracy and stability.

Method: 提出EvoPSF框架，利用规划器不确定性作为触发信号，通过自监督损失对关键对象进行针对性模型更新。

Result: 实验表明，EvoPSF在nuScenes数据集的跨区域和损坏变体上均显著提升了规划性能。

Conclusion: EvoPSF通过在线进化机制有效提升了自动驾驶系统在复杂环境中的鲁棒性和规划准确性。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed remarkable progress in autonomous driving, with
systems evolving from modular pipelines to end-to-end architectures. However,
most existing methods are trained offline and lack mechanisms to adapt to new
environments during deployment. As a result, their generalization ability
diminishes when faced with unseen variations in real-world driving scenarios.
In this paper, we break away from the conventional "train once, deploy forever"
paradigm and propose EvoPSF, a novel online Evolution framework for autonomous
driving based on Planning-State Feedback. We argue that planning failures are
primarily caused by inaccurate object-level motion predictions, and such
failures are often reflected in the form of increased planner uncertainty. To
address this, we treat planner uncertainty as a trigger for online evolution,
using it as a diagnostic signal to initiate targeted model updates. Rather than
performing blind updates, we leverage the planner's agent-agent attention to
identify the specific objects that the ego vehicle attends to most, which are
primarily responsible for the planning failures. For these critical objects, we
compute a targeted self-supervised loss by comparing their predicted waypoints
from the prediction module with their actual future positions, selected from
the perception module's outputs with high confidence scores. This loss is then
backpropagated to adapt the model online. As a result, our method improves the
model's robustness to environmental changes, leads to more precise motion
predictions, and therefore enables more accurate and stable planning behaviors.
Experiments on both cross-region and corrupted variants of the nuScenes dataset
demonstrate that EvoPSF consistently improves planning performance under
challenging conditions.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: OVSegDT是一种轻量级Transformer策略，通过语义分支和熵自适应损失调制，显著提升了开放词汇目标导航的泛化能力和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有端到端策略在小规模模拟数据集上的过拟合问题，以及泛化能力不足和不安全行为（频繁碰撞）。

Method: 1. 语义分支：包含目标二进制掩码编码器和辅助分割损失函数，用于文本目标的空间定位。2. 熵自适应损失调制：动态平衡模仿和强化信号，避免手动阶段切换。

Result: 训练样本复杂度降低33%，碰撞次数减少一半，推理成本低（130M参数，仅RGB输入）。在HM3D-OVON上，未见类别性能与已见类别相当，达到SOTA（40.1% SR，20.9% SPL）。

Conclusion: OVSegDT通过创新设计显著提升了开放词汇目标导航的性能和安全性，且无需深度、里程计或大型视觉语言模型支持。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary Object Goal Navigation requires an embodied agent to reach
objects described by free-form language, including categories never seen during
training. Existing end-to-end policies overfit small simulator datasets,
achieving high success on training scenes but failing to generalize and
exhibiting unsafe behaviour (frequent collisions). We introduce OVSegDT, a
lightweight transformer policy that tackles these issues with two synergistic
components. The first component is the semantic branch, which includes an
encoder for the target binary mask and an auxiliary segmentation loss function,
grounding the textual goal and providing precise spatial cues. The second
component consists of a proposed Entropy-Adaptive Loss Modulation, a per-sample
scheduler that continuously balances imitation and reinforcement signals
according to the policy entropy, eliminating brittle manual phase switches.
These additions cut the sample complexity of training by 33%, and reduce
collision count in two times while keeping inference cost low (130M parameters,
RGB-only input). On HM3D-OVON, our model matches the performance on unseen
categories to that on seen ones and establishes state-of-the-art results (40.1%
SR, 20.9% SPL on val unseen) without depth, odometry, or large vision-language
models. Code is available at https://github.com/CognitiveAISystems/OVSegDT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前UGV数据集在传感器配置、时间同步、地面真实性和场景多样性方面存在不足，限制了导航与建图技术的发展。

Abstract: Accurate and reliable navigation is crucial for autonomous unmanned ground
vehicle (UGV). However, current UGV datasets fall short in meeting the demands
for advancing navigation and mapping techniques due to limitations in sensor
configuration, time synchronization, ground truth, and scenario diversity. To
address these challenges, we present i2Nav-Robot, a large-scale dataset
designed for multi-sensor fusion navigation and mapping in indoor-outdoor
environments. We integrate multi-modal sensors, including the newest front-view
and 360-degree solid-state LiDARs, 4-dimensional (4D) radar, stereo cameras,
odometer, global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receiver, and inertial
measurement units (IMU) on an omnidirectional wheeled robot. Accurate
timestamps are obtained through both online hardware synchronization and
offline calibration for all sensors. The dataset comprises ten larger-scale
sequences covering diverse UGV operating scenarios, such as outdoor streets,
and indoor parking lots, with a total length of about 17060 meters.
High-frequency ground truth, with centimeter-level accuracy for position, is
derived from post-processing integrated navigation methods using a
navigation-grade IMU. The proposed i2Nav-Robot dataset is evaluated by more
than ten open-sourced multi-sensor fusion systems, and it has proven to have
superior data quality.

Result: 在Argoverse 2和nuPlan基准测试中，Polaris实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 极坐标表示能更有效地建模空间变化和相对关系，提升轨迹预测与规划的准确性。

Abstract: Trajectory prediction and planning in autonomous driving are highly
challenging due to the complexity of predicting surrounding agents' movements
and planning the ego agent's actions in dynamic environments. Existing methods
encode map and agent positions and decode future trajectories in Cartesian
coordinates. However, modeling the relationships between the ego vehicle and
surrounding traffic elements in Cartesian space can be suboptimal, as it does
not naturally capture the varying influence of different elements based on
their relative distances and directions. To address this limitation, we adopt
the Polar coordinate system, where positions are represented by radius and
angle. This representation provides a more intuitive and effective way to model
spatial changes and relative relationships, especially in terms of distance and
directional influence. Based on this insight, we propose Polaris, a novel
method that operates entirely in Polar coordinates, distinguishing itself from
conventional Cartesian-based approaches. By leveraging the Polar
representation, this method explicitly models distance and direction variations
and captures relative relationships through dedicated encoding and refinement
modules, enabling more structured and spatially aware trajectory prediction and
planning. Extensive experiments on the challenging prediction (Argoverse 2) and
planning benchmarks (nuPlan) demonstrate that Polaris achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

Abstract: Reliable autonomous navigation across the unstructured terrains of distant
planetary surfaces is a critical enabler for future space exploration. However,
the deployment of learning-based controllers is hindered by the inherent
sim-to-real gap, particularly for the complex dynamics of wheel interactions
with granular media. This work presents a complete sim-to-real framework for
developing and validating robust control policies for dynamic waypoint tracking
on such challenging surfaces. We leverage massively parallel simulation to
train reinforcement learning agents across a vast distribution of procedurally
generated environments with randomized physics. These policies are then
transferred zero-shot to a physical wheeled rover operating in a lunar-analogue
facility. Our experiments systematically compare multiple reinforcement
learning algorithms and action smoothing filters to identify the most effective
combinations for real-world deployment. Crucially, we provide strong empirical
evidence that agents trained with procedural diversity achieve superior
zero-shot performance compared to those trained on static scenarios. We also
analyze the trade-offs of fine-tuning with high-fidelity particle physics,
which offers minor gains in low-speed precision at a significant computational
cost. Together, these contributions establish a validated workflow for creating
reliable learning-based navigation systems, marking a critical step towards
deploying autonomous robots in the final frontier.

Conclusion: 研究为敏捷运动生成提供了浮动基参数化选择的参考。

Abstract: Automatically generating agile whole-body motions for legged and humanoid
robots remains a fundamental challenge in robotics. While numerous trajectory
optimization approaches have been proposed, there is no clear guideline on how
the choice of floating-base space parameterization affects performance,
especially for agile behaviors involving complex contact dynamics. In this
paper, we present a comparative study of different parameterizations for direct
transcription-based trajectory optimization of agile motions in legged systems.
We systematically evaluate several common choices under identical optimization
settings to ensure a fair comparison. Furthermore, we introduce a novel
formulation based on the tangent space of SE(3) for representing the robot's
floating-base pose, which, to our knowledge, has not received attention from
the literature. This approach enables the use of mature off-the-shelf numerical
solvers without requiring specialized manifold optimization techniques. We hope
that our experiments and analysis will provide meaningful insights for
selecting the appropriate floating-based representation for agile whole-body
motion generation.

Result: 在真实数据集上评估显示MultiPark在多种场景中达到最优性能，并在实际车辆上验证了其鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MultiPark通过多模态建模和因果混淆缓解，显著提升了停车行为的多样性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Parking accurately and safely in highly constrained spaces remains a critical
challenge. Unlike structured driving environments, parking requires executing
complex maneuvers such as frequent gear shifts and steering saturation. Recent
attempts to employ imitation learning (IL) for parking have achieved promising
results. However, existing works ignore the multimodal nature of parking
behavior in lane-free open space, failing to derive multiple plausible
solutions under the same situation. Notably, IL-based methods encompass
inherent causal confusion, so enabling a neural network to generalize across
diverse parking scenarios is particularly difficult. To address these
challenges, we propose MultiPark, an autoregressive transformer for multimodal
parking. To handle paths filled with abrupt turning points, we introduce a
data-efficient next-segment prediction paradigm, enabling spatial
generalization and temporal extrapolation. Furthermore, we design learnable
parking queries factorized into gear, longitudinal, and lateral components,
parallelly decoding diverse parking behaviors. To mitigate causal confusion in
IL, our method employs target-centric pose and ego-centric collision as
outcome-oriented loss across all modalities beyond pure imitation loss.
Evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that MultiPark achieves
state-of-the-art performance across various scenarios. We deploy MultiPark on a
production vehicle, further confirming our approach's robustness in real-world
parking environments.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of tracking the position of a
cable-suspended payload carried by an unmanned aerial vehicle, with a focus on
real-world deployment and minimal hardware requirements. In contrast to many
existing approaches that rely on motion-capture systems, additional onboard
cameras, or instrumented payloads, we propose a framework that uses only
standard onboard sensors--specifically, real-time kinematic global navigation
satellite system measurements and data from the onboard inertial measurement
unit--to estimate and control the payload's position. The system models the
full coupled dynamics of the aerial vehicle and payload, and integrates a
linear Kalman filter for state estimation, a model predictive contouring
control planner, and an incremental model predictive controller. The control
architecture is designed to remain effective despite sensing limitations and
estimation uncertainty. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed
system achieves performance comparable to control based on ground-truth
measurements, with only minor degradation (< 6%). The system also shows strong
robustness to variations in payload parameters. Field experiments further
validate the framework, confirming its practical applicability and reliable
performance in outdoor environments using only off-the-shelf aerial vehicle
hardware.

Result: 优选方法在路径长度、重叠率和成本方面表现更优，适合手动操作。

Conclusion: 简化的一或两段控制方法在无传感器条件下更具成本效益，适合实际应用。

Abstract: Automatic Section Control (ASC) is a long-standing trend for spraying in
agriculture. It promises to minimise spray overlap areas. The core idea is to
(i) switch off spray nozzles on areas that have already been sprayed, and (ii)
to dynamically adjust nozzle flow rates along the boom bar that holds the spray
nozzles when velocities of boom sections vary during turn maneuvers. ASC is not
possible without sensors, in particular for accurate positioning data. Spraying
and the movement of modern wide boom bars are highly dynamic processes. In
addition, many uncertainty factors have an effect such as cross wind drift,
boom height, nozzle clogging in open-field conditions, and so forth. In view of
this complexity, the natural question arises if a simpler alternative exist.
Therefore, an Automatic Multi-Sections Control method is compared to a proposed
simpler one- or two-sections alternative that uses predictive spray switching.
The comparison is provided under nominal conditions. Agricultural spraying is
intrinsically linked to area coverage path planning and spray switching logic.
Combinations of two area coverage path planning and switching logics as well as
three sections-setups are compared. The three sections-setups differ by
controlling 48 sections, 2 sections or controlling all nozzles uniformly with
the same control signal as one single section. Methods are evaluated on 10
diverse real-world field examples, including non-convex field contours,
freeform mainfield lanes and multiple obstacle areas. A preferred method is
suggested that (i) minimises area coverage pathlength, (ii) offers intermediate
overlap, (iii) is suitable for manual driving by following a pre-planned
predictive spray switching logic for an area coverage path plan, and (iv) and
in contrast to ASC can be implemented sensor-free and therefore at low cost.

Abstract: Deploying multiple machine learning models on resource-constrained robotic
platforms for different perception tasks often results in redundant
computations, large memory footprints, and complex integration challenges. In
response, this work presents Visual Perception Engine (VPEngine), a modular
framework designed to enable efficient GPU usage for visual multitasking while
maintaining extensibility and developer accessibility. Our framework
architecture leverages a shared foundation model backbone that extracts image
representations, which are efficiently shared, without any unnecessary GPU-CPU
memory transfers, across multiple specialized task-specific model heads running
in parallel. This design eliminates the computational redundancy inherent in
feature extraction component when deploying traditional sequential models while
enabling dynamic task prioritization based on application demands. We
demonstrate our framework's capabilities through an example implementation
using DINOv2 as the foundation model with multiple task (depth, object
detection and semantic segmentation) heads, achieving up to 3x speedup compared
to sequential execution. Building on CUDA Multi-Process Service (MPS), VPEngine
offers efficient GPU utilization and maintains a constant memory footprint
while allowing per-task inference frequencies to be adjusted dynamically during
runtime. The framework is written in Python and is open source with ROS2 C++
(Humble) bindings for ease of use by the robotics community across diverse
robotic platforms. Our example implementation demonstrates end-to-end real-time
performance at $\geq$50 Hz on NVIDIA Jetson Orin AGX for TensorRT optimized
models.

Abstract: Effective and efficient agricultural manipulation and harvesting depend on
accurately understanding the current state of the grasp. The agricultural
environment presents unique challenges due to its complexity, clutter, and
occlusion. Additionally, fruit is physically attached to the plant, requiring
precise separation during harvesting. Selecting appropriate sensors and
modeling techniques is critical for obtaining reliable feedback and correctly
identifying grasp states. This work investigates a set of key sensors, namely
inertial measurement units (IMUs), infrared (IR) reflectance, tension, tactile
sensors, and RGB cameras, integrated into a compliant gripper to classify grasp
states. We evaluate the individual contribution of each sensor and compare the
performance of two widely used classification models: Random Forest and Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Our results demonstrate that a Random Forest
classifier, trained in a controlled lab environment and tested on real cherry
tomato plants, achieved 100% accuracy in identifying slip, grasp failure, and
successful picks, marking a substantial improvement over baseline performance.
Furthermore, we identify a minimal viable sensor combination, namely IMU and
tension sensors that effectively classifies grasp states. This classifier
enables the planning of corrective actions based on real-time feedback, thereby
enhancing the efficiency and reliability of fruit harvesting operations.

Abstract: Current audio deepfake detectors cannot be trusted. While they excel on
controlled benchmarks, they fail when tested in the real world. We introduce
Perturbed Public Voices (P$^{2}$V), an IRB-approved dataset capturing three
critical aspects of malicious deepfakes: (1) identity-consistent transcripts
via LLMs, (2) environmental and adversarial noise, and (3) state-of-the-art
voice cloning (2020-2025). Experiments reveal alarming vulnerabilities of 22
recent audio deepfake detectors: models trained on current datasets lose 43%
performance when tested on P$^{2}$V, with performance measured as the mean of
F1 score on deepfake audio, AUC, and 1-EER. Simple adversarial perturbations
induce up to 16% performance degradation, while advanced cloning techniques
reduce detectability by 20-30%. In contrast, P$^{2}$V-trained models maintain
robustness against these attacks while generalizing to existing datasets,
establishing a new benchmark for robust audio deepfake detection. P$^{2}$V will
be publicly released upon acceptance by a conference/journal.

Abstract: Generating high-quality and temporally synchronized audio from video content
is essential for video editing and post-production tasks, enabling the creation
of semantically aligned audio for silent videos. However, most existing
approaches focus on short-form audio generation for video segments under 10
seconds or rely on noisy datasets for long-form video-to-audio zsynthesis. To
address these limitations, we introduce LD-LAudio-V1, an extension of
state-of-the-art video-to-audio models and it incorporates dual lightweight
adapters to enable long-form audio generation. In addition, we release a clean
and human-annotated video-to-audio dataset that contains pure sound effects
without noise or artifacts. Our method significantly reduces splicing artifacts
and temporal inconsistencies while maintaining computational efficiency.
Compared to direct fine-tuning with short training videos, LD-LAudio-V1
achieves significant improvements across multiple metrics: $FD_{\text{passt}}$

Abstract: Recently, discrete tokens derived from self-supervised learning (SSL) models
via k-means clustering have been actively studied as pseudo-text in speech
language models and as efficient intermediate representations for various
tasks. However, these discrete tokens are typically learned in advance,
separately from the training of language models or downstream tasks. As a
result, choices related to discretization, such as the SSL model used or the
number of clusters, must be made heuristically. In particular, speech language
models are expected to understand and generate responses that reflect not only
the semantic content but also prosodic features. Yet, there has been limited
research on the ability of discrete tokens to capture prosodic information. To
address this gap, this study conducts a comprehensive analysis focusing on
prosodic encoding based on their sensitivity to the artificially modified
prosody, aiming to provide practical guidelines for designing discrete tokens.

Abstract: This paper presents Fosafer approach to the Track 2 Mandarin in the
Multimodal Emotion and Intent Joint Understandingchallenge, which focuses on
achieving joint recognition of emotion and intent in Mandarin, despite the
issue of category imbalance. To alleviate this issue, we use a variety of data

experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which
achieves the second-best performance in the Track 2 Mandarin challenge.

Method: FLUID采用Q-transforms、两阶段融合方案（对比对齐和自适应融合）以及轻量级专家混合机制。

Result: 在GLAMI-1M基准测试中达到91%准确率，显著优于基线方法，并对噪声和类不平衡表现出强韧性。

Conclusion: FLUID是一种可扩展且抗噪声的多模态分类解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal classification requires robust integration of visual and textual
signals, yet common fusion strategies are brittle and vulnerable to
modality-specific noise. In this paper, we present \textsc{FLUID}-Flow-Latent
Unified Integration via Token Distillation for Expert Specialization, a
principled token-level pipeline that improves cross-modal robustness and
scalability. \textsc{FLUID} contributes three core elements: (1)
\emph{Q-transforms}, learnable query tokens that distill and retain salient
token-level features from modality-specific backbones; (2) a two-stage fusion
scheme that enforces cross-modal consistency via contrastive alignment and then
performs adaptive, task-aware fusion through a gating mechanism and a
\emph{Q-bottleneck} that selectively compresses information for downstream
reasoning; and (3) a lightweight, load-balanced Mixture-of-Experts at
prediction time that enables efficient specialization to diverse semantic
patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \textsc{FLUID} attains
\(91\%\) accuracy on the GLAMI-1M benchmark, significantly outperforming prior
baselines and exhibiting strong resilience to label noise, long-tail class
imbalance, and semantic heterogeneity. Targeted ablation studies corroborate
both the individual and synergistic benefits of the proposed components,
positioning \textsc{FLUID} as a scalable, noise-resilient solution for
multimodal product classification.

Result: 研究为子宫肌瘤自动分割提供了标准化评估基准，促进未来研究。

Conclusion: 公开数据集和深度学习为子宫肌瘤自动分割提供了可行方案，有助于临床实践和研究发展。

Abstract: Uterine fibroids (myomas) are the most common benign tumors of the female
reproductive system, particularly among women of childbearing age. With a
prevalence exceeding 70%, they pose a significant burden on female reproductive
health. Clinical symptoms such as abnormal uterine bleeding, infertility,
pelvic pain, and pressure-related discomfort play a crucial role in guiding
treatment decisions, which are largely influenced by the size, number, and
anatomical location of the fibroids. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a
non-invasive and highly accurate imaging modality commonly used by clinicians
for the diagnosis of uterine fibroids. Segmenting uterine fibroids requires a
precise assessment of both the uterus and fibroids on MRI scans, including
measurements of volume, shape, and spatial location. However, this process is
labor intensive and time consuming and subjected to variability due to intra-
and inter-expert differences at both pre- and post-treatment stages. As a
result, there is a critical need for an accurate and automated segmentation
method for uterine fibroids. In recent years, deep learning algorithms have
shown re-markable improvements in medical image segmentation, outperforming
traditional methods. These approaches offer the potential for fully automated
segmentation. Several studies have explored the use of deep learning models to
achieve automated segmentation of uterine fibroids. However, most of the
previous work has been conducted using private datasets, which poses challenges
for validation and comparison between studies. In this study, we leverage the
publicly available Uterine Myoma MRI Dataset (UMD) to establish a baseline for
automated segmentation of uterine fibroids, enabling standardized evaluation
and facilitating future research in this domain.

Abstract: Accurate and scalable cancer diagnosis remains a critical challenge in modern
pathology, particularly for malignancies such as breast, prostate, bone, and
cervical, which exhibit complex histological variability. In this study, we
propose a transformer-based deep learning framework for multi-class tumor
classification in histopathological images. Leveraging a fine-tuned Vision
Transformer (ViT) architecture, our method addresses key limitations of
conventional convolutional neural networks, offering improved performance,
reduced preprocessing requirements, and enhanced scalability across tissue
types. To adapt the model for histopathological cancer images, we implement a
streamlined preprocessing pipeline that converts tiled whole-slide images into
PyTorch tensors and standardizes them through data normalization. This ensures
compatibility with the ViT architecture and enhances both convergence stability
and overall classification performance. We evaluate our model on four benchmark
datasets: ICIAR2018 (breast), SICAPv2 (prostate), UT-Osteosarcoma (bone), and
SipakMed (cervical) dataset -- demonstrating consistent outperformance over
existing deep learning methods. Our approach achieves classification accuracies
of 99.32%, 96.92%, 95.28%, and 96.94% for breast, prostate, bone, and cervical
cancers respectively, with area under the ROC curve (AUC) scores exceeding 99%
across all datasets. These results confirm the robustness, generalizability,
and clinical potential of transformer-based architectures in digital pathology.
Our work represents a significant advancement toward reliable, automated, and
interpretable cancer diagnosis systems that can alleviate diagnostic burdens
and improve healthcare outcomes.

Method: 综述了TKR结果评估的现有评分协议和膝关节对齐生物标志物，并讨论了基于AI的膝关节对齐生物标志物生成方法。

Result: 现有研究多关注膝关节OA诊断和MRI中的骨骼或软骨分割，而非膝关节对齐生物标志物与TKR结果的关联。

Conclusion: 未来需进一步探索膝关节对齐评估和TKR结果预测的AI方法。

Abstract: Prevalent knee osteoarthritis (OA) imposes substantial burden on health
systems with no cure available. Its ultimate treatment is total knee
replacement (TKR). Complications from surgery and recovery are difficult to
predict in advance, and numerous factors may affect them. Radiographic knee
alignment is one of the key factors that impacts TKR outcomes, affecting
outcomes such as postoperative pain or function. Recently, artificial
intelligence (AI) has been introduced to the automatic analysis of knee
radiographs, for example, to automate knee alignment measurements. Existing
review articles tend to focus on knee OA diagnosis and segmentation of bones or
cartilages in MRI rather than exploring knee alignment biomarkers for TKR
outcomes and their assessment. In this review, we first examine the current
scoring protocols for evaluating TKR outcomes and potential knee alignment
biomarkers associated with these outcomes. We then discuss existing AI-based
approaches for generating knee alignment biomarkers from knee radiographs, and
explore future directions for knee alignment assessment and TKR outcome
prediction.

Abstract: Deep Learning has emerged as a promising approach for skin lesion analysis.
However, existing methods mostly rely on fully supervised learning, requiring
extensive labeled data, which is challenging and costly to obtain. To alleviate
this annotation burden, this study introduces a novel semi-supervised deep
learning approach that integrates ensemble learning with online knowledge
distillation for enhanced skin lesion classification. Our methodology involves
training an ensemble of convolutional neural network models, using online
knowledge distillation to transfer insights from the ensemble to its members.
This process aims to enhance the performance of each model within the ensemble,
thereby elevating the overall performance of the ensemble itself.
Post-training, any individual model within the ensemble can be deployed at test
time, as each member is trained to deliver comparable performance to the
ensemble. This is particularly beneficial in resource-constrained environments.
Experimental results demonstrate that the knowledge-distilled individual model
performs better than independently trained models. Our approach demonstrates
superior performance on both the \emph{International Skin Imaging
Collaboration} 2018 and 2019 public benchmark datasets, surpassing current
state-of-the-art results. By leveraging ensemble learning and online knowledge
distillation, our method reduces the need for extensive labeled data while
providing a more resource-efficient solution for skin lesion classification in
real-world scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统CT扫描中因视野限制导致的投影数据截断问题，以及现有扩散模型计算效率低下的问题。

Method: 采用图像到图像的Schrödinger Bridge（I²SB）扩散模型，直接学习有限视野与扩展视野图像之间的随机映射。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据上均表现出色，RMSE分别为49.8HU和152.0HU，重建速度达0.19秒/切片。

Conclusion: I²SB在精度和效率上均优于现有方法，适合实时或临床部署。

Abstract: Computed tomography (CT) is a cornerstone imaging modality for non-invasive,
high-resolution visualization of internal anatomical structures. However, when
the scanned object exceeds the scanner's field of view (FOV), projection data
are truncated, resulting in incomplete reconstructions and pronounced artifacts
near FOV boundaries. Conventional reconstruction algorithms struggle to recover
accurate anatomy from such data, limiting clinical reliability. Deep learning
approaches have been explored for FOV extension, with diffusion generative
models representing the latest advances in image synthesis. Yet, conventional
diffusion models are computationally demanding and slow at inference due to
their iterative sampling process. To address these limitations, we propose an
efficient CT FOV extension framework based on the image-to-image Schr\"odinger
Bridge (I$^2$SB) diffusion model. Unlike traditional diffusion models that
synthesize images from pure Gaussian noise, I$^2$SB learns a direct stochastic
mapping between paired limited-FOV and extended-FOV images. This direct
correspondence yields a more interpretable and traceable generative process,
enhancing anatomical consistency and structural fidelity in reconstructions.
I$^2$SB achieves superior quantitative performance, with root-mean-square error
(RMSE) values of 49.8\,HU on simulated noisy data and 152.0HU on real data,
outperforming state-of-the-art diffusion models such as conditional denoising
diffusion probabilistic models (cDDPM) and patch-based diffusion methods.
Moreover, its one-step inference enables reconstruction in just 0.19s per 2D
slice, representing over a 700-fold speedup compared to cDDPM (135s) and
surpassing diffusionGAN (0.58s), the second fastest. This combination of
accuracy and efficiency makes I$^2$SB highly suitable for real-time or clinical
deployment.

Motivation: 低比特率压缩（如用户生成内容中的多次转码）常导致频带伪影（如天空等平滑区域），影响视觉质量。

Method: 采用小波状态空间模型和频率掩码图，保留高频细节，抑制频带伪影。

Result: 在BAND-2k数据集上，DBI值为0.082，优于现有方法，且能保持图像纹理。

Conclusion: 所提出的后处理方法能有效抑制频带伪影，同时保留图像细节，性能优于现有技术。

Abstract: Compression at low bitrates in modern codecs often introduces banding
artifacts, especially in smooth regions such as skies. These artifacts degrade
visual quality and are common in user-generated content due to repeated
transcoding. We propose a banding restoration method that employs the Wavelet
State Space Model and a frequency masking map to preserve high-frequency
details. Furthermore, we provide a benchmark of open-source banding restoration
methods and evaluate their performance on two public banding image datasets.
Experimentation on the available datasets suggests that the proposed
post-processing approach effectively suppresses banding compared to the
state-of-the-art method (a DBI value of 0.082 on BAND-2k) while preserving
image textures. Visual inspections of the results confirm this. Code and

Motivation: 当前GAN方法在医学图像合成中缺乏空间一致性和多样性，AnatoMaskGAN旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 设计了基于GNN的切片特征融合模块、三维空间噪声注入策略和灰度纹理分类器，以增强空间关系和纹理多样性。

Result: 在L2R-OASIS和L2R-Abdomen CT数据集上，PSNR和SSIM指标显著提升，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AnatoMaskGAN的核心设计在提升重建精度和感知质量方面具有独立价值，实验验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Medical semantic-mask synthesis boosts data augmentation and analysis, yet
most GAN-based approaches still produce one-to-one images and lack spatial
consistency in complex scans. To address this, we propose AnatoMaskGAN, a novel
synthesis framework that embeds slice-related spatial features to precisely
aggregate inter-slice contextual dependencies, introduces diverse
image-augmentation strategies, and optimizes deep feature learning to improve
performance on complex medical images. Specifically, we design a GNN-based
strongly correlated slice-feature fusion module to model spatial relationships
between slices and integrate contextual information from neighboring slices,
thereby capturing anatomical details more comprehensively; we introduce a
three-dimensional spatial noise-injection strategy that weights and fuses
spatial features with noise to enhance modeling of structural diversity; and we
incorporate a grayscale-texture classifier to optimize grayscale distribution
and texture representation during generation. Extensive experiments on the
public L2R-OASIS and L2R-Abdomen CT datasets show that AnatoMaskGAN raises PSNR
on L2R-OASIS to 26.50 dB (0.43 dB higher than the current state of the art) and
achieves an SSIM of 0.8602 on L2R-Abdomen CT--a 0.48 percentage-point gain over
the best model, demonstrating its superiority in reconstruction accuracy and
perceptual quality. Ablation studies that successively remove the slice-feature
fusion module, spatial 3D noise-injection strategy, and grayscale-texture
classifier reveal that each component contributes significantly to PSNR, SSIM,
and LPIPS, further confirming the independent value of each core design in
enhancing reconstruction accuracy and perceptual quality.

Conclusion: LKFMixer通过大卷积核和轻量化设计，实现了高效且高性能的图像超分辨率。

Abstract: The success of self-attention (SA) in Transformer demonstrates the importance
of non-local information to image super-resolution (SR), but the huge computing
power required makes it difficult to implement lightweight models. To solve
this problem, we propose a pure convolutional neural network (CNN) model,
LKFMixer, which utilizes large convolutional kernel to simulate the ability of
self-attention to capture non-local features. Specifically, we increase the
kernel size to 31 to obtain the larger receptive field as possible, and reduce
the parameters and computations by coordinate decomposition. Meanwhile, a
spatial feature modulation block (SFMB) is designed to enhance the focus of
feature information on both spatial and channel dimension. In addition, by
introducing feature selection block (FSB), the model can adaptively adjust the
weights between local features and non-local features. Extensive experiments
show that the proposed LKFMixer family outperform other state-of-the-art (SOTA)
methods in terms of SR performance and reconstruction quality. In particular,
compared with SwinIR-light on Manga109 dataset, LKFMixer-L achieves 0.6dB PSNR
improvement at $\times$4 scale, while the inference speed is $\times$5 times
faster. The code is available at https://github.com/Supereeeee/LKFMixer.

Abstract: Subcortical segmentation in neuroimages plays an important role in
understanding brain anatomy and facilitating computer-aided diagnosis of
traumatic brain injuries and neurodegenerative disorders. However, training
accurate automatic models requires large amounts of labelled data. Despite the
availability of publicly available subcortical segmentation datasets for
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), a significant gap exists for Computed
Tomography (CT). This paper proposes an automatic ensemble framework to
generate high-quality subcortical segmentation labels for CT scans by
leveraging existing MRI-based models. We introduce a robust ensembling pipeline
to integrate them and apply it to unannotated paired MRI-CT data, resulting in
a comprehensive CT subcortical segmentation dataset. Extensive experiments on
multiple public datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed
framework. Furthermore, using our generated CT dataset, we train segmentation
models that achieve improved performance on related segmentation tasks. To
facilitate future research, we make our source code, generated dataset, and
trained models publicly available at
https://github.com/SCSE-Biomedical-Computing-Group/CT-Subcortical-Segmentation,
marking the first open-source release for CT subcortical segmentation to the

Abstract: The impact of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on
methamphetamine (METH) users' craving levels is often assessed using
questionnaires. This study explores the feasibility of using neural signals to
obtain more objective results. EEG signals recorded from 20 METH-addicted
participants Before and After rTMS (MBT and MAT) and from 20 healthy
participants (HC) are analyzed. In each EEG paradigm, participants are shown 15
METH-related and 15 neutral pictures randomly, and the relative band power
(RBP) of each EEG sub-band frequency is derived. The average RBP across all 31
channels, as well as individual brain regions, is analyzed. Statistically,
MAT's alpha, beta, and gamma RBPs are more like those of HC compared to MBT, as
indicated by the power topographies. Utilizing a random forest (RF), the gamma
RBP is identified as the optimal frequency band for distinguishing between MBT
and HC with a 90% accuracy. The performance of classifying MAT versus HC is
lower than that of MBT versus HC, suggesting that the efficacy of rTMS can be
validated using RF with gamma RBP. Furthermore, the gamma RBP recorded by the
TP10 and CP2 channels dominates the classification task of MBT versus HC when
receiving METH-related image cues. The gamma RBP during exposure to
METH-related cues can serve as a biomarker for distinguishing between MBT and
HC and for evaluating the effectiveness of rTMS. Therefore, real-time
monitoring of gamma RBP variations holds promise as a parameter for
implementing a customized closed-loop neuromodulation system for treating METH
addiction.

### [260] [Data-driven global ocean model resolving ocean-atmosphere coupling dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10908)
*Jeong-Hwan Kim,Daehyun Kang,Young-Min Yang,Jae-Heung Park,Yoo-Geun Ham*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: KIST-Ocean是一种基于深度学习的全球三维海洋环流模型，通过U形视觉注意力对抗网络架构，显著提升了海洋预测的准确性和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数值模型在季节以上时间尺度的预测中存在局限性，需要开发能够模拟复杂海洋-大气耦合响应的深度学习模型。

Method: 采用U形视觉注意力对抗网络架构，结合部分卷积、对抗训练和迁移学习，解决沿海复杂性和预测分布漂移问题。

Result: 模型表现出强大的海洋预测能力和效率，准确捕捉了热带太平洋的Kelvin和Rossby波传播等关键海洋-大气耦合机制。

Conclusion: KIST-Ocean的成功验证了深度学习在全球天气和气候模型中的潜力，为扩展地球系统建模提供了新思路。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has advanced global weather forecasting,
outperforming traditional numerical models in both accuracy and computational
efficiency. Nevertheless, extending predictions beyond subseasonal timescales
requires the development of deep learning (DL)-based ocean-atmosphere coupled
models that can realistically simulate complex oceanic responses to atmospheric
forcing. This study presents KIST-Ocean, a DL-based global three-dimensional
ocean general circulation model using a U-shaped visual attention adversarial
network architecture. KIST-Ocean integrates partial convolution, adversarial
training, and transfer learning to address coastal complexity and predictive
distribution drift in auto-regressive models. Comprehensive evaluations
confirmed the model's robust ocean predictive skill and efficiency. Moreover,
it accurately captures realistic ocean response, such as Kelvin and Rossby wave
propagation in the tropical Pacific, and vertical motions induced by cyclonic
and anticyclonic wind stress, demonstrating its ability to represent key
ocean-atmosphere coupling mechanisms underlying climate phenomena, including
the El Nino-Southern Oscillation. These findings reinforce confidence in
DL-based global weather and climate models and their extending DL-based
approaches to broader Earth system modeling, offering potential for enhancing
climate prediction capabilities.

### [261] [Approximating the universal thermal climate index using sparse regression with orthogonal polynomials](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11307)
*Sabin Roman,Gregor Skok,Ljupco Todorovski,Saso Dzeroski*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于数据驱动的方法，利用正交多项式基（如Legendre多项式）和稀疏回归技术，高效且可解释地近似Universal Thermal Climate Index（UTCI）。该方法在稳定性和收敛性上优于传统多项式扩展，并以更少的参数实现了更低的均方根误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UTCI是一个复杂的非线性多变量生理气候指标，传统方法（如六次多项式）在精度和效率上存在不足。本文旨在开发一种更高效且可解释的建模方法。

Method: 采用符号回归和稀疏回归技术，结合Legendre多项式基，构建模型。通过正交基的分解，实现稳定且层次化的系数结构。

Result: 模型在仅使用20%数据训练的情况下，对剩余80%数据表现出稳健的泛化能力，均方根误差显著低于传统方法。

Conclusion: 结合稀疏性、正交性和符号结构的方法，在精度和效率上显著优于现有技术，为复杂环境指标的建模提供了新思路。

Abstract: This article explores novel data-driven modeling approaches for analyzing and
approximating the Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI), a
physiologically-based metric integrating multiple atmospheric variables to
assess thermal comfort. Given the nonlinear, multivariate structure of UTCI, we
investigate symbolic and sparse regression techniques as tools for
interpretable and efficient function approximation. In particular, we highlight
the benefits of using orthogonal polynomial bases-such as Legendre
polynomials-in sparse regression frameworks, demonstrating their advantages in
stability, convergence, and hierarchical interpretability compared to standard
polynomial expansions. We demonstrate that our models achieve significantly
lower root-mean squared losses than the widely used sixth-degree polynomial
benchmark-while using the same or fewer parameters. By leveraging Legendre
polynomial bases, we construct models that efficiently populate a Pareto front
of accuracy versus complexity and exhibit stable, hierarchical coefficient
structures across varying model capacities. Training on just 20% of the data,
our models generalize robustly to the remaining 80%, with consistent
performance under bootstrapping. The decomposition effectively approximates the
UTCI as a Fourier-like expansion in an orthogonal basis, yielding results near
the theoretical optimum in the L2 (least squares) sense. We also connect these
findings to the broader context of equation discovery in environmental
modeling, referencing probabilistic grammar-based methods that enforce domain
consistency and compactness in symbolic expressions. Taken together, these
results illustrate how combining sparsity, orthogonality, and symbolic
structure enables robust, interpretable modeling of complex environmental
indices like UTCI - and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art
approximation in both accuracy and efficiency.

Motivation: 研究语言模型随时间推移的算法效率变化，试图量化算法进步的程度。

Method: 收集语言模型的损失和计算数据，分析固定计算量下损失的下降趋势。

Result: 发现语言模型的算法效率随时间提高。

Conclusion: 估计方法可能因算法质量的潜在性和计算选择的内生性而产生偏差。

Abstract: Ho et. al (2024) is an interesting paper that attempts to estimate the degree
of algorithmic progress from language models. They collect observational data
on language models' loss and compute over time, and argue that as time has
passed, language models' algorithmic efficiency has been rising. That is, the
loss achieved for fixed compute has been dropping over time. In this note, I
want to raise one potential methodological problem with the estimation
strategy. Intuitively, if part of algorithmic quality is latent, and compute
choices are endogenous to algorithmic quality, then resulting estimates of
algorithmic quality will be biased.

Method: 通过网络层分析识别问题，提出基于XML QoS配置的优化框架，无需修改协议或增加组件。

Result: 实验表明，优化框架在现有DDS模式失败的无线场景下成功传输大负载，并保持低延迟。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了ROS 2中无线传输大负载的性能问题，且易于集成。

Abstract: Wireless transmission of large payloads, such as high-resolution images and
LiDAR point clouds, is a major bottleneck in ROS 2, the leading open-source
robotics middleware. The default Data Distribution Service (DDS) communication
stack in ROS 2 exhibits significant performance degradation over lossy wireless
links. Despite the widespread use of ROS 2, the underlying causes of these
wireless communication challenges remain unexplored. In this paper, we present
the first in-depth network-layer analysis of ROS 2's DDS stack under wireless
conditions with large payloads. We identify the following three key issues:
excessive IP fragmentation, inefficient retransmission timing, and congestive
buffer bursts. To address these issues, we propose a lightweight and fully
compatible DDS optimization framework that tunes communication parameters based
on link and payload characteristics. Our solution can be seamlessly applied
through the standard ROS 2 application interface via simple XML-based QoS
configuration, requiring no protocol modifications, no additional components,
and virtually no integration efforts. Extensive experiments across various
wireless scenarios demonstrate that our framework successfully delivers large
payloads in conditions where existing DDS modes fail, while maintaining low
end-to-end latency.

Abstract: It is often the case that risk assessment and prognostics are viewed as
related but separate tasks. This chapter describes a risk-based approach to
prognostics that seeks to provide a tighter coupling between risk assessment

continuous-time Bayesian network as the underlying modeling framework.
Furthermore, we provide an overview of the techniques that are available to
derive these models from data and show how they might be used in practice to
achieve tasks like decision support and performance-based logistics. This work
is intended to provide an overview of the recent developments related to
risk-based prognostics, and we hope that it will serve as a tutorial of sorts
that will assist others in adopting these techniques.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 科学事实核查旨在通过检索和分析研究文献中的证据来确定科学主张的真实性。现有方法简化了问题，仅基于摘要而非全文，忽略了处理完整文档的挑战。本文探讨了当前系统的局限性，并提出了改进方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学事实核查比一般事实核查更复杂，需适应科学知识的动态性、学术文献的结构复杂性及多模态表达。现有方法未能充分利用全文资源。

Method: 分析了证据检索中的关键挑战，包括语义限制、时间感知检索、结构化解析、复杂表达处理和文献可信度评估。

Result: 初步实验验证了这些挑战，并提出了潜在解决方案。

Conclusion: 本文旨在推动科学事实核查的发展，提出专为实际应用设计的IR系统。

Abstract: Scientific fact-checking aims to determine the veracity of scientific claims
by retrieving and analysing evidence from research literature. The problem is
inherently more complex than general fact-checking since it must accommodate
the evolving nature of scientific knowledge, the structural complexity of
academic literature and the challenges posed by long-form, multimodal
scientific expression. However, existing approaches focus on simplified
versions of the problem based on small-scale datasets consisting of abstracts
rather than full papers, thereby avoiding the distinct challenges associated
with processing complete documents. This paper examines the limitations of
current scientific fact-checking systems and reveals the many potential
features and resources that could be exploited to advance their performance. It
identifies key research challenges within evidence retrieval, including (1)
evidence-driven retrieval that addresses semantic limitations and topic
imbalance (2) time-aware evidence retrieval with citation tracking to mitigate
outdated information, (3) structured document parsing to leverage long-range
context, (4) handling complex scientific expressions, including tables,
figures, and domain-specific terminology and (5) assessing the credibility of
scientific literature. Preliminary experiments were conducted to substantiate
these challenges and identify potential solutions. This perspective paper aims
to advance scientific fact-checking with a specialised IR system tailored for
real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SEO策略在生成式搜索引擎中失效，内容创作者面临可见性下降的挑战，需要新的优化方法。

Method: 提出Role-Augmented Intent-Driven G-SEO方法，通过多样化角色建模搜索意图，并扩展GEO数据集和G-Eval 2.0评估标准。

Result: 实验表明，搜索意图能有效指导内容优化，显著提升GSE中的主观印象和客观可见性。

Conclusion: G-SEO方法为生成式搜索引擎提供了有效的优化路径，解决了传统SEO的局限性。

Abstract: Generative Search Engines (GSEs), powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), are reshaping information retrieval.
While commercial systems (e.g., BingChat, Perplexity.ai) demonstrate impressive
semantic synthesis capabilities, their black-box nature fundamentally
undermines established Search Engine Optimization (SEO) practices. Content
creators face a critical challenge: their optimization strategies, effective in
traditional search engines, are misaligned with generative retrieval contexts,
resulting in diminished visibility. To bridge this gap, we propose a
Role-Augmented Intent-Driven Generative Search Engine Optimization (G-SEO)
method, providing a structured optimization pathway tailored for GSE scenarios.
Our method models search intent through reflective refinement across diverse
informational roles, enabling targeted content enhancement. To better evaluate
the method under realistic settings, we address the benchmarking limitations of
prior work by: (1) extending the GEO dataset with diversified query variations
reflecting real-world search scenarios and (2) introducing G-Eval 2.0, a
6-level LLM-augmented evaluation rubric for fine-grained human-aligned
assessment. Experimental results demonstrate that search intent serves as an
effective signal for guiding content optimization, yielding significant
improvements over single-aspect baseline approaches in both subjective
impressions and objective content visibility within GSE responses.

Motivation: 传统论文搜索系统仅基于摘要构建索引，无法满足灵活粒度的搜索需求。

Method: 采用离线分层索引和在线自适应检索，将传统基于摘要的索引转化为分层索引树。

Result: 实验表明，PaperRegister在多种粒度搜索任务中表现最优，尤其在细粒度场景下表现出色。

Conclusion: PaperRegister是一种有效的灵活粒度论文搜索解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Paper search is an important activity for researchers, typically involving
using a query with description of a topic to find relevant papers. As research
deepens, paper search requirements may become more flexible, sometimes
involving specific details such as module configuration rather than being
limited to coarse-grained topics. However, previous paper search systems are
unable to meet these flexible-grained requirements, as these systems mainly
collect paper abstracts to construct index of corpus, which lack detailed
information to support retrieval by finer-grained queries. In this work, we
propose PaperRegister, consisted of offline hierarchical indexing and online
adaptive retrieval, transforming traditional abstract-based index into
hierarchical index tree for paper search, thereby supporting queries at
flexible granularity. Experiments on paper search tasks across a range of
granularity demonstrate that PaperRegister achieves the state-of-the-art
performance, and particularly excels in fine-grained scenarios, highlighting
the good potential as an effective solution for flexible-grained paper search
in real-world applications. Code for this work is in

Conclusion: 研究表明，将验证反馈整合到文档相关性评估中，对科学事实检查系统具有潜力，未来可探索细粒度相关性评估。

Abstract: Identification of appropriate supporting evidence is critical to the success
of scientific fact checking. However, existing approaches rely on off-the-shelf
Information Retrieval algorithms that rank documents based on relevance rather
than the evidence they provide to support or refute the claim being checked.
This paper proposes +VeriRel which includes verification success in the
document ranking. Experimental results on three scientific fact checking
datasets (SciFact, SciFact-Open and Check-Covid) demonstrate consistently
leading performance by +VeriRel for document evidence retrieval and a positive
impact on downstream verification. This study highlights the potential of
integrating verification feedback to document relevance assessment for
effective scientific fact checking systems. It shows promising future work to
evaluate fine-grained relevance when examining complex documents for advanced
scientific fact checking.

Result: 纠缠在平均情况下提供计算优势，直至输入频率阈值，且在高耗散率下性能可能增强。纠缠改善了平均和最差情况性能，但对最佳误差无影响。

Conclusion: 研究为高性能量子储层计算和时序预测提供了新见解，表明纠缠和耗散在优化量子机器学习中的潜在作用。

Abstract: Quantum Reservoir Computing (QRC) uses quantum dynamics to efficiently
process temporal data. In this work, we investigate a QRC framework based on
two coupled Kerr nonlinear oscillators, a system well-suited for time-series
prediction tasks due to its complex nonlinear interactions and potentially
high-dimensional state space. We explore how its performance in time-series
prediction depends on key physical parameters: input drive strength, Kerr
nonlinearity, and oscillator coupling, and analyze the role of entanglement in
improving the reservoir's computational performance, focusing on its effect on
predicting non-trivial time series. Using logarithmic negativity to quantify
entanglement and normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) to evaluate
predictive accuracy, our results suggest that entanglement provides a
computational advantage on average-up to a threshold in the input
frequency-that persists under some levels of dissipation and dephasing. In
particular, we find that higher dissipation rates can enhance performance.
While the entanglement advantage manifests as improvements in both average and
worst-case performance, it does not lead to improvements in the best-case
error. These findings contribute to the broader understanding of quantum
reservoirs for high performance, efficient quantum machine learning and
time-series forecasting.

Result: 证明FO²带两个线性序关系或无环关系时是#P₁-难的，但C²带线性序及其后继关系时存在多项式时间算法。

Conclusion: 多关系公理的扩展对WFOMC复杂性有显著影响，部分情况仍可高效计算。

Abstract: The Weighted First-Order Model Counting Problem (WFOMC) asks to compute the
weighted sum of models of a given first-order logic sentence over a given
domain. The boundary between fragments for which WFOMC can be computed in
polynomial time relative to the domain size lies between the two-variable
fragment ($\text{FO}^2$) and the three-variable fragment ($\text{FO}^3$). It is
known that WFOMC for \FOthree{} is $\mathsf{\#P_1}$-hard while polynomial-time
algorithms exist for computing WFOMC for $\text{FO}^2$ and $\text{C}^2$,
possibly extended by certain axioms such as the linear order axiom, the
acyclicity axiom, and the connectedness axiom. All existing research has
concentrated on extending the fragment with axioms on a single distinguished
relation, leaving a gap in understanding the complexity boundary of axioms on
multiple relations. In this study, we explore the extension of the two-variable
fragment by axioms on two relations, presenting both negative and positive
results. We show that WFOMC for $\text{FO}^2$ with two linear order relations
and $\text{FO}^2$ with two acyclic relations are $\mathsf{\#P_1}$-hard.
Conversely, we provide an algorithm in time polynomial in the domain size for
WFOMC of $\text{C}^2$ with a linear order relation, its successor relation and
another successor relation.

Motivation: 现有噪声鲁棒的时空融合方法常导致空间结构模糊或伪影，TSSTF旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 引入TGTV和TGEC机制，将时空融合任务建模为约束优化问题，并采用预条件原始对偶分裂方法求解。

Result: TSSTF在无噪声条件下与现有方法相当，在噪声条件下表现更优，并提供推荐参数以增强实用性。

Conclusion: TSSTF有效提升了噪声条件下的时空融合性能，具有实用性和可重复性。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel spatiotemporal (ST) fusion framework for
satellite images, named Temporally-Similar Structure-Aware ST fusion (TSSTF).
ST fusion is a promising approach to address the trade-off between the spatial
and temporal resolution of satellite images. In real-world scenarios, observed
satellite images are severely degraded by noise due to measurement equipment
and environmental conditions. Consequently, some recent studies have focused on
enhancing the robustness of ST fusion methods against noise. However, existing
noise-robust ST fusion approaches often fail to capture fine spatial structure,
leading to oversmoothing and artifacts. To address this issue, TSSTF introduces
two key mechanisms: Temporally-Guided Total Variation (TGTV) and
Temporally-Guided Edge Constraint (TGEC). TGTV is a novel regularization
function that promotes spatial piecewise smoothness while preserving structural
details, guided by a reference high spatial resolution image acquired on a
nearby date. TGEC enforces consistency in edge locations between two temporally
adjacent images, while allowing for spectral variations. We formulate the ST
fusion task as a constrained optimization problem incorporating TGTV and TGEC,
and develop an efficient algorithm based on a preconditioned primal-dual
splitting method. Experimental results demonstrate that TSSTF performs
comparably to state-of-the-art methods under noise-free conditions and
outperforms them under noisy conditions. Additionally, we provide a
comprehensive set of recommended parameter values that consistently yield high
performance across diverse target regions and noise conditions, aiming to
enhance reproducibility and practical utility.

Motivation: 低边际效应基因变异在复杂疾病中起重要作用，但现有方法难以高效分析其联合作用。

Method: 提出TAMW方法，通过模拟和实证数据验证其性能。

Conclusion: TAMW是一种高效且强大的工具，适用于分析LME基因变异的联合作用，揭示了克罗恩病的新致病基因。

Abstract: Common complex diseases are likely influenced by the interplay of hundreds,
or even thousands, of genetic variants. Converging evidence shows that genetic
variants with low marginal effects (LME) play an important role in disease
development. Despite their potential significance, discovering LME genetic
variants and assessing their joint association on high dimensional data (e.g.,
genome wide association studies) remain a great challenge. To facilitate joint
association analysis among a large ensemble of LME genetic variants, we
proposed a computationally efficient and powerful approach, which we call Trees
Assembling Mann whitney (TAMW). Through simulation studies and an empirical
data application, we found that TAMW outperformed multifactor dimensionality
reduction (MDR) and the likelihood ratio based Mann whitney approach (LRMW)
when the underlying complex disease involves multiple LME loci and their
interactions. For instance, in a simulation with 20 interacting LME loci, TAMW
attained a higher power (power=0.931) than both MDR (power=0.599) and LRMW
(power=0.704). In an empirical study of 29 known Crohn's disease (CD) loci,
TAMW also identified a stronger joint association with CD than those detected
by MDR and LRMW. Finally, we applied TAMW to Wellcome Trust CD GWAS to conduct
a genome wide analysis. The analysis of 459K single nucleotide polymorphisms
was completed in 40 hours using parallel computing, and revealed a joint
association predisposing to CD (p-value=2.763e-19). Further analysis of the
newly discovered association suggested that 13 genes, such as ATG16L1 and
LACC1, may play an important role in CD pathophysiological and etiological
processes.

Motivation: LLM与外部工具集成（如通过MCP协议）会引入安全漏洞（如提示注入、数据泄露等），亟需解决方案。

Method: MCP-Guard采用三阶段检测：静态扫描、深度神经网络检测语义攻击、基于E5的模型（96.01%准确率）和轻量级LLM仲裁器。

Result: MCP-Guard在检测对抗性提示时达到96.01%的准确率，同时最小化误报。

Conclusion: MCP-Guard和MCP-AttackBench为LLM-工具生态系统的安全研究提供了有效工具和基准。

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with external tools via
protocols such as the Model Context Protocol (MCP) introduces critical security
vulnerabilities, including prompt injection, data exfiltration, and other
threats. To counter these challenges, we propose MCP-Guard, a robust, layered

three-stage detection pipeline that balances efficiency with accuracy: it
progresses from lightweight static scanning for overt threats and a deep neural
detector for semantic attacks, to our fine-tuned E5-based model achieves
(96.01) accuracy in identifying adversarial prompts. Finally, a lightweight LLM
arbitrator synthesizes these signals to deliver the final decision while
minimizing false positives. To facilitate rigorous training and evaluation, we
also introduce MCP-AttackBench, a comprehensive benchmark of over 70,000

simulates diverse, real-world attack vectors in the MCP format, providing a

Motivation: 由于缺乏细粒度行为级标注，现有方法在检测用户行为序列中的异常时面临高误报率和漏报率。

Method: 提出RMSL框架，利用多球体表示行为模式，结合多实例学习和自适应行为级自训练去偏，优化特征表示。

Result: 实验表明RMSL显著提升了行为级内部威胁检测的性能。

Conclusion: RMSL通过弱标签和多球体学习有效解决了行为级异常检测的挑战。

Abstract: Insider threat detection aims to identify malicious user behavior by
analyzing logs that record user interactions. Due to the lack of fine-grained
behavior-level annotations, detecting specific behavior-level anomalies within
user behavior sequences is challenging. Unsupervised methods face high false
positive rates and miss rates due to the inherent ambiguity between normal and
anomalous behaviors. In this work, we instead introduce weak labels of behavior
sequences, which have lower annotation costs, i.e., the training labels
(anomalous or normal) are at sequence-level instead of behavior-level, to
enhance the detection capability for behavior-level anomalies by learning
discriminative features. To achieve this, we propose a novel framework called
Robust Multi-sphere Learning (RMSL). RMSL uses multiple hyper-spheres to
represent the normal patterns of behaviors. Initially, a one-class classifier
is constructed as a good anomaly-supervision-free starting point. Building on
this, using multiple instance learning and adaptive behavior-level
self-training debiasing based on model prediction confidence, the framework
further refines hyper-spheres and feature representations using weak
sequence-level labels. This approach enhances the model's ability to
distinguish between normal and anomalous behaviors. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that RMSL significantly improves the performance of behavior-level
insider threat detection.

### [276] [Non-asymptotic convergence bound of conditional diffusion models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10944)
*Mengze Li*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于条件扩散模型的分类与回归方法（CARD），通过整合预训练模型，改进了条件分布的学习能力，并建立了理论分析框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管条件扩散模型在加速算法和生成质量方面取得了进展，但缺乏非渐近性质阻碍了理论研究。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: CARD模型将预训练模型f_{\phi}(x)整合到扩散框架中，以精确捕捉条件分布Y|f_{\phi}(x)。通过推导随机微分方程和Fokker-Planck方程，建立了理论分析基础。

Result: 在Lipschitz假设下，利用二阶Wasserstein距离证明了生成条件分布与原分布的上界误差。附加轻尾假设后，推导了得分函数与网络估计值的收敛上界。

Conclusion: CARD模型不仅改进了条件分布的学习能力，还为其提供了坚实的理论基础，推动了条件扩散模型的理论研究。

Abstract: Learning and generating various types of data based on conditional diffusion
models has been a research hotspot in recent years. Although conditional
diffusion models have made considerable progress in improving acceleration
algorithms and enhancing generation quality, the lack of non-asymptotic
properties has hindered theoretical research. To address this gap, we focus on
a conditional diffusion model within the domains of classification and
regression (CARD), which aims to learn the original distribution with given
input x (denoted as Y|X). It innovatively integrates a pre-trained model
f_{\phi}(x) into the original diffusion model framework, allowing it to
precisely capture the original conditional distribution given f (expressed as
Y|f_{\phi}(x)). Remarkably, when f_{\phi}(x) performs satisfactorily,
Y|f_{\phi}(x) closely approximates Y|X. Theoretically, we deduce the stochastic
differential equations of CARD and establish its generalized form predicated on
the Fokker-Planck equation, thereby erecting a firm theoretical foundation for
analysis. Mainly under the Lipschitz assumptions, we utilize the second-order
Wasserstein distance to demonstrate the upper error bound between the original
and the generated conditional distributions. Additionally, by appending
assumptions such as light-tailedness to the original distribution, we derive
the convergence upper bound between the true value analogous to the score
function and the corresponding network-estimated value.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为BJ Boost Q learning的框架，用于在右删失生存数据下估计最优动态治疗方案，结合加速失效时间模型和迭代提升技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统Cox-based Q learning在风险模型假设下可能存在的偏差问题，提供更灵活和稳健的估计方法。

Method: 整合加速失效时间模型与迭代提升技术（如最小二乘和回归树），在反事实Q学习框架下直接建模条件生存时间。

Result: 在模拟研究和HIV试验分析中，BJ Boost Q learning在治疗决策中表现出更高的准确性，尤其在多阶段设置中。

Conclusion: BJ Boost Q learning避免了比例风险假设的限制，提供了更灵活和稳健的动态治疗方案估计方法。

Abstract: We propose a Buckley James (BJ) Boost Q learning framework for estimating
optimal dynamic treatment regimes under right censored survival data, tailored
for longitudinal randomized clinical trial settings. The method integrates
accelerated failure time models with iterative boosting techniques, including
componentwise least squares and regression trees, within a counterfactual Q
learning framework. By directly modeling conditional survival time, BJ Boost Q
learning avoids the restrictive proportional hazards assumption and enables
unbiased estimation of stage specific Q functions. Grounded in potential
outcomes, this framework ensures identifiability of the optimal treatment
regime under standard causal assumptions. Compared to Cox based Q learning,
which relies on hazard modeling and may suffer from bias under
misspecification, our approach provides robust and flexible estimation.
Simulation studies and analysis of the ACTG175 HIV trial demonstrate that BJ
Boost Q learning yields higher accuracy in treatment decision making,
especially in multistage settings where bias can accumulate.

Motivation: 填补高斯核KRR理论理解的空白，特别是在固定超参数情况下的一致性和$L^{2}$收敛速率。

Method: 使用高斯核岭回归，固定超参数，分析其在一致性和$L^{2}$范数中的收敛行为。

Result: 证明了多项式收敛速率，为固定超参数的高斯核KRR提供了理论支持。

Conclusion: 结果为非参数回归中使用固定超参数的高斯核KRR提供了新的理论依据。

Abstract: This paper establishes the first polynomial convergence rates for Gaussian
kernel ridge regression (KRR) with a fixed hyperparameter in both the uniform
and the $L^{2}$-norm. The uniform convergence result closes a gap in the
theoretical understanding of KRR with the Gaussian kernel, where no such rates
were previously known. In addition, we prove a polynomial $L^{2}$-convergence
rate in the case, where the Gaussian kernel's width parameter is fixed. This
also contributes to the broader understanding of smooth kernels, for which
previously only sub-polynomial $L^{2}$-rates were known in similar settings.
Together, these results provide new theoretical justification for the use of
Gaussian KRR with fixed hyperparameters in nonparametric regression.

Abstract: Determining the optimal data mixture for large language model training
remains a challenging problem with an outsized impact on performance. In
practice, language model developers continue to rely on heuristic exploration
since no learning-based approach has emerged as a reliable solution. In this
work, we propose to view the selection of training data mixtures as a black-box
hyperparameter optimization problem, for which Bayesian Optimization is a
well-established class of appropriate algorithms. Firstly, we cast data mixture
learning as a sequential decision-making problem, in which we aim to find a
suitable trade-off between the computational cost of training exploratory
(proxy-) models and final mixture performance. Secondly, we systematically
explore the properties of transferring mixtures learned at a small scale to
larger-scale experiments, providing insights and highlighting opportunities for
research at a modest scale. By proposing Multi-fidelity Bayesian Optimization
as a suitable method in this common scenario, we introduce a natural framework
to balance experiment cost with model fit, avoiding the risks of overfitting to
smaller scales while minimizing the number of experiments at high cost. We
present results for pre-training and instruction finetuning across models
ranging from 1 million to 7 billion parameters, varying from simple
architectures to state-of-the-art models and benchmarks spanning dozens of
datasets. We demonstrate consistently strong results relative to a wide range
of benchmarks, showingspeed-ups of over 500% in determining the best data
mixture on our largest experiments relative to recent baselines. In addition,
we broaden access to research by sharing ADMIRE IFT Runs, a dataset of 460 full
training & evaluation runs across various model sizes worth over 13,000 GPU
hours, greatly reducing the cost of conducting research in this area.

Motivation: 传统参数化方法假设漂移函数形式已知，而本文旨在直接从数据中学习漂移函数，适用于系统动力学部分已知或高度复杂的科学领域。

Method: 将估计问题转化为RKHS中的惩罚负对数似然函数最小化，开发了结合SMC的EM算法处理稀疏观测，并使用贝叶斯变体控制模型复杂度。

Result: 提出的EM-SMC-RKHS方法在低数据情况下能准确估计漂移函数，并通过数值实验验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为连续时间建模提供了一种广泛适用的解决方案，特别适用于观测受限的场景。

Abstract: The paper proposes a systematic framework for building data-driven stochastic
differential equation (SDE) models from sparse, noisy observations. Unlike
traditional parametric approaches, which assume a known functional form for the
drift, our goal here is to learn the entire drift function directly from data
without strong structural assumptions, making it especially relevant in
scientific disciplines where system dynamics are partially understood or highly
complex. We cast the estimation problem as minimization of the penalized
negative log-likelihood functional over a reproducing kernel Hilbert space
(RKHS). In the sparse observation regime, the presence of unobserved trajectory
segments makes the SDE likelihood intractable. To address this, we develop an
Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm that employs a novel Sequential Monte
Carlo (SMC) method to approximate the filtering distribution and generate Monte
Carlo estimates of the E-step objective. The M-step then reduces to a penalized
empirical risk minimization problem in the RKHS, whose minimizer is given by a
finite linear combination of kernel functions via a generalized representer
theorem. To control model complexity across EM iterations, we also develop a
hybrid Bayesian variant of the algorithm that uses shrinkage priors to identify
significant coefficients in the kernel expansion. We establish important
theoretical convergence results for both the exact and approximate EM
sequences. The resulting EM-SMC-RKHS procedure enables accurate estimation of
the drift function of stochastic dynamical systems in low-data regimes and is
broadly applicable across domains requiring continuous-time modeling under
observational constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method
through a series of numerical experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SNN的多时间步计算模型增加了推理延迟和能耗，限制了其在边缘计算场景的应用。

Method: 设计了自丢弃神经元机制，通过动态阈值调整和选择性脉冲抑制增强信息承载能力；采用贝叶斯优化全局搜索时间参数。

Conclusion: 单时间步SNN在保持或超越传统SNN精度的同时，显著降低了能耗，适用于边缘计算。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), as an emerging biologically inspired
computational model, demonstrate significant energy efficiency advantages due
to their event-driven information processing mechanism. Compared to traditional
Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), SNNs transmit information through discrete
spike signals, which substantially reduces computational energy consumption
through their sparse encoding approach. However, the multi-timestep computation
model significantly increases inference latency and energy, limiting the
applicability of SNNs in edge computing scenarios. We propose a single-timestep
SNN, which enhances accuracy and reduces computational energy consumption in a
single timestep by optimizing spike generation and temporal parameters. We
design a Self-Dropping Neuron mechanism, which enhances information-carrying
capacity through dynamic threshold adjustment and selective spike suppression.
Furthermore, we employ Bayesian optimization to globally search for time
parameters and obtain an efficient inference mode with a single time step.
Experimental results on the Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 datasets
demonstrate that, compared to traditional multi-timestep SNNs employing the
Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) model, our method achieves classification
accuracies of 93.72%, 92.20%, and 69.45%, respectively, using only
single-timestep spikes, while maintaining comparable or even superior accuracy.
Additionally, it reduces energy consumption by 56%, 21%, and 22%, respectively.

Abstract: As the demand for more efficient and adaptive computing grows,
nature-inspired architectures offer promising alternatives to conventional
electronic designs. Microfluidic platforms, drawing on biological forms and
fluid dynamics, present a compelling foundation for low-power, high-resilience
computing in environments where electronics are unsuitable. This study explores
a hybrid reservoir computing system based on a dragonfly-wing inspired
microfluidic chip, which encodes temporal input patterns as fluid interactions
within the micro channel network.
  The system operates with three dye-based inlet channels and three
camera-monitored detection areas, transforming discrete spatial patterns into
dynamic color output signals. These reservoir output signals are then modified
and passed to a simple and trainable readout layer for pattern classification.
Using a combination of raw reservoir outputs and synthetically generated
outputs, we evaluated system performance, system clarity, and data efficiency.
The results demonstrate consistent classification accuracies up to $91\%$, even
with coarse resolution and limited training data, highlighting the viability of
the microfluidic reservoir computing.

Motivation: 传统ADMM在节点故障或攻击下容易发散，需要一种更鲁棒的分布式优化方法。

Method: 提出DW-ADMM，利用动态权重调整网络边上的权重，增强鲁棒性。

Result: DW-ADMM在无错误时与传统ADMM结果接近，在拜占庭攻击下仍能保证解的有界性。

Conclusion: DW-ADMM在分布式优化中表现出良好的鲁棒性和有效性。

Abstract: The alternating direction of multipliers method (ADMM) is a popular method to
solve distributed consensus optimization utilizing efficient communication
among various nodes in the network. However, in the presence of faulty or
attacked nodes, even a small perturbation (or sharing false data) during the
communication can lead to divergence of the solution. To address this issue, in
this work we consider ADMM under the effect of Byzantine threat, where an
unknown subset of nodes is subject to Byzantine attacks or faults. We propose
Dynamically Weighted ADMM (DW-ADMM), a novel variant of ADMM that uses dynamic
weights on the edges of the network, thus promoting resilient distributed
optimization. We establish that the proposed method (i) produces a nearly
identical solution to conventional ADMM in the error-free case, and (ii)
guarantees a bounded solution with respect to the global minimizer, even under
Byzantine threat. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
algorithm using an illustrative numerical simulation.

Abstract: Digital humans are emerging as autonomous agents in multiparty interactions,
yet existing evaluation metrics largely ignore contextual coordination
dynamics. We introduce a unified, intervention-driven framework for objective
assessment of multiparty social behaviour in skeletal motion data, spanning
three complementary dimensions: (1) synchrony via Cross-Recurrence
Quantification Analysis, (2) temporal alignment via Multiscale Empirical Mode
Decompositionbased Beat Consistency, and (3) structural similarity via Soft
Dynamic Time Warping. We validate metric sensitivity through three
theory-driven perturbations -- gesture kinematic dampening, uniform
speech-gesture delays, and prosodic pitch-variance reduction-applied to
$\approx 145$ 30-second thin slices of group interactions from the DnD dataset.
Mixed-effects analyses reveal predictable, joint-independent shifts: dampening
increases CRQA determinism and reduces beat consistency, delays weaken
cross-participant coupling, and pitch flattening elevates F0 Soft-DTW costs. A
complementary perception study ($N=27$) compares judgments of full-video and
skeleton-only renderings to quantify representation effects. Our three measures
deliver orthogonal insights into spatial structure, timing alignment, and
behavioural variability. Thereby forming a robust toolkit for evaluating and
refining socially intelligent agents. Code available on

Abstract: The increasing heterogeneity of student populations poses significant
challenges for teachers, particularly in mathematics education, where
cognitive, motivational, and emotional differences strongly influence learning
outcomes. While AI-driven personalization tools have emerged, most remain
performance-focused, offering limited support for teachers and neglecting
broader pedagogical needs. This paper presents the FACET framework, a
teacher-facing, large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent system designed to
generate individualized classroom materials that integrate both cognitive and
motivational dimensions of learner profiles. The framework comprises three
specialized agents: (1) learner agents that simulate diverse profiles
incorporating topic proficiency and intrinsic motivation, (2) a teacher agent
that adapts instructional content according to didactical principles, and (3)
an evaluator agent that provides automated quality assurance. We tested the
system using authentic grade 8 mathematics curriculum content and evaluated its
feasibility through a) automated agent-based assessment of output quality and
b) exploratory feedback from K-12 in-service teachers. Results from ten
internal evaluations highlighted high stability and alignment between generated
materials and learner profiles, and teacher feedback particularly highlighted
structure and suitability of tasks. The findings demonstrate the potential of
multi-agent LLM architectures to provide scalable, context-aware
personalization in heterogeneous classroom settings, and outline directions for
extending the framework to richer learner profiles and real-world classroom
trials.

Abstract: Data from psychophysiological measures can offer new insight into control
room operators' behaviour, cognition, and mental workload status. This can be
particularly helpful when combined with appraisal of capacity to respond to
possible critical plant conditions (i.e. critical alarms response scenarios).
However, wearable physiological measurement tools such as eye tracking and EEG
caps can be perceived as intrusive and not suitable for usage in daily
operations. Therefore, this article examines the potential of using real-time
data from process and operator-system interactions during abnormal scenarios
that can be recorded and retrieved from the distributed control system's
historian or process log, and their capacity to provide insight into operator
behavior and predict their response outcomes, without intruding on daily tasks.
Data for this study were obtained from a design of experiment using a
formaldehyde production plant simulator and four human-in-the-loop experimental
support configurations. A comparison between the different configurations in
terms of both behaviour and performance is presented in this paper. A step-wise
logistic regression and a Bayesian network models were used to achieve this
objective. The results identified some predictive metrics and the paper discuss
their value as precursor or predictor of overall system performance in alarm
response scenarios. Knowledge of relevant and predictive behavioural metrics
accessible in real time can better equip decision-makers to predict outcomes
and provide timely support measures for operators.

Abstract: While research on human-AI collaboration exists, it mainly examined language
learning and used traditional counting methods with little attention to
evolution and dynamics of collaboration on cognitively demanding tasks. This
study examines human-AI interactions while solving a complex problem.
Student-AI interactions were qualitatively coded and analyzed with transition
network analysis, sequence analysis and partial correlation networks as well as
comparison of frequencies using chi-square and Person-residual shaded Mosaic
plots to map interaction patterns, their evolution, and their relationship to
problem complexity and student performance. Findings reveal a dominant
Instructive pattern with interactions characterized by iterative ordering
rather than collaborative negotiation. Oftentimes, students engaged in long
threads that showed misalignment between their prompts and AI output that
exemplified a lack of synergy that challenges the prevailing assumptions about
LLMs as collaborative partners. We also found no significant correlations
between assignment complexity, prompt length, and student grades suggesting a
lack of cognitive depth, or effect of problem difficulty. Our study indicates
that the current LLMs, optimized for instruction-following rather than
cognitive partnership, compound their capability to act as cognitively
stimulating or aligned collaborators. Implications for designing AI systems
that prioritize cognitive alignment and collaboration are discussed.

Abstract: Human-Robot-Collaboration can enhance workflows by leveraging the mutual
strengths of human operators and robots. Planning and understanding robot
movements remain major challenges in this domain. This problem is prevalent in
dynamic environments that might need constant robot motion path adaptation. In
this paper, we investigate whether a minimalistic encoding of the reachability
of a point near an object of interest, which we call ReachVox, can aid the
collaboration between a remote operator and a robotic arm in VR. Through a user
study (n=20), we indicate the strength of the visualization relative to a
point-based reachability check-up.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合人类导师与AI的创业辅导系统，通过认知模型和大型语言模型支持新手和导师的思考，提升会议质量和情感共鸣。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 新手创业者在面对开放式问题时缺乏元认知能力，而导师时间有限，难以提供个性化支持。

Method: 开发了一个结合领域特定认知模型和大型语言模型的人机协作系统，主动提出诊断性问题并支持会议规划。

Result: 系统提升了新手的元认知能力，帮助导师制定情感共鸣策略，改善了会议的深度和专注度，但也揭示了AI信任和误诊等问题。

Conclusion: 论文提出了支持元认知和人机协作的AI系统设计原则，适用于医疗、教育等类似领域。

Abstract: Entrepreneurship requires navigating open-ended, ill-defined problems:
identifying risks, challenging assumptions, and making strategic decisions
under deep uncertainty. Novice founders often struggle with these metacognitive
demands, while mentors face limited time and visibility to provide tailored
support. We present a human-AI coaching system that combines a domain-specific
cognitive model of entrepreneurial risk with a large language model (LLM) to
proactively scaffold both novice and mentor thinking. The system proactively
poses diagnostic questions that challenge novices' thinking and helps both
novices and mentors plan for more focused and emotionally attuned meetings.
Critically, mentors can inspect and modify the underlying cognitive model,
shaping the logic of the system to reflect their evolving needs. Through an
exploratory field deployment, we found that using the system supported novice
metacognition, helped mentors plan emotionally attuned strategies, and improved
meeting depth, intentionality, and focus--while also surfaced key tensions
around trust, misdiagnosis, and expectations of AI. We contribute design
principles for proactive AI systems that scaffold metacognition and human-human
collaboration in complex, ill-defined domains, offering implications for
similar domains like healthcare, education, and knowledge work.

Motivation: 原住民文化面临系统边缘化和城市发展的威胁，需要创新方法来保护和传播其文化遗产。

Method: 开发了两种语义分析管道（视觉和文本），并将其整合到一个交互式可视化工具中，支持基于相似性、时间和地理的探索。

Result: 系统不仅支持策展任务和公众参与，还揭示了藏品中的潜在联系，展示了AI在文化保护中的伦理贡献。

Conclusion: AI技术可以以伦理方式助力文化遗产的保存与传播，为原住民文化提供新的展示与互动途径。

Abstract: Indigenous communities face ongoing challenges in preserving their cultural
heritage, particularly in the face of systemic marginalization and urban
development. In Brazil, the Museu Nacional dos Povos Indigenas through the
Tainacan platform hosts the country's largest online collection of Indigenous
objects and iconographies, providing a critical resource for cultural
engagement. Using publicly available data from this repository, we present a
data-driven initiative that applies artificial intelligence to enhance
accessibility, interpretation, and exploration. We develop two semantic
pipelines: a visual pipeline that models image-based similarity and a textual
pipeline that captures semantic relationships from item descriptions. These
embedding spaces are projected into two dimensions and integrated into an
interactive visualization tool we also developed. In addition to
similarity-based navigation, users can explore the collection through temporal
and geographic lenses, enabling both semantic and contextualized perspectives.
The system supports curatorial tasks, aids public engagement, and reveals
latent connections within the collection. This work demonstrates how AI can
ethically contribute to cultural preservation practices.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态基准框架，用于评估通用人工智能（GPAI）在软件工程中表现出的认知偏见，发现GPAI系统存在依赖浅层语言启发式的倾向，且偏见敏感性随任务复杂性增加而显著上升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探讨GPAI系统是否会因训练数据中的人类认知偏见而表现出类似偏见，从而影响软件工程中的决策。

Method: 方法包括开发动态基准框架，通过16个手工任务和基于GPAI的任务变体生成管道，评估GPAI系统的偏见表现，并利用Prolog推理和LLM验证确保任务正确性。

Result: 结果显示，主流GPAI系统（如GPT、LLaMA、DeepSeek）均表现出认知偏见（5.9%至35%），且偏见敏感性随任务复杂性增加（最高达49%）。

Conclusion: 结论指出GPAI系统在软件工程中存在认知偏见风险，需进一步研究以减轻其影响。

Abstract: Human cognitive biases in software engineering can lead to costly errors.
While general-purpose AI (GPAI) systems may help mitigate these biases due to
their non-human nature, their training on human-generated data raises a
critical question: Do GPAI systems themselves exhibit cognitive biases?
  To investigate this, we present the first dynamic benchmarking framework to
evaluate data-induced cognitive biases in GPAI within software engineering
workflows. Starting with a seed set of 16 hand-crafted realistic tasks, each
featuring one of 8 cognitive biases (e.g., anchoring, framing) and
corresponding unbiased variants, we test whether bias-inducing linguistic cues
unrelated to task logic can lead GPAI systems from correct to incorrect
conclusions.
  To scale the benchmark and ensure realism, we develop an on-demand
augmentation pipeline relying on GPAI systems to generate task variants that
preserve bias-inducing cues while varying surface details. This pipeline
ensures correctness (88--99% on average, according to human evaluation),
promotes diversity, and controls reasoning complexity by leveraging
Prolog-based reasoning and LLM-as-a-judge validation. It also verifies that the
embedded biases are both harmful and undetectable by logic-based, unbiased
reasoners.
  We evaluate leading GPAI systems (GPT, LLaMA, DeepSeek) and find a consistent
tendency to rely on shallow linguistic heuristics over deep reasoning. All
systems exhibit cognitive biases (ranging from 5.9% to 35% across types), with
bias sensitivity increasing sharply with task complexity (up to 49%),
highlighting critical risks in real-world software engineering deployments.

Result: 初步研究表明，与传统AI工具相比，该方法能显著提高学习效果和学生信心。

Conclusion: 通过迭代优化，AI可以构建动态、反馈驱动的个性化学习环境。

Abstract: A Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) approach leverages generative AI to enhance
personalized learning by directly integrating student feedback into
AI-generated solutions. Students critique and modify AI responses using
predefined feedback tags, fostering deeper engagement and understanding. This
empowers students to actively shape their learning, with AI serving as an
adaptive partner. The system uses a tagging technique and prompt engineering to
personalize content, informing a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to
retrieve relevant educational material and adjust explanations in real time.
This builds on existing research in adaptive learning, demonstrating how
student-driven feedback loops can modify AI-generated responses for improved
student retention and engagement, particularly in STEM education. Preliminary
findings from a study with STEM students indicate improved learning outcomes
and confidence compared to traditional AI tools. This work highlights AI's
potential to create dynamic, feedback-driven, and personalized learning
environments through iterative refinement.

Motivation: 当前LLM在心理健康诊断领域表现不佳，依赖稀缺敏感数据且缺乏临床推理能力，亟需改进。

Method: 通过模拟治疗师-客户对话生成诊断问卷，提供透明、逐步的预测结果。

Result: 实验评估了LLM在对话真实性、诊断准确性和可解释性三个维度的表现，结果开放共享。

Conclusion: DSM5AgentFlow可作为心理健康诊断的补充工具，符合伦理和法律标准。

Abstract: LLM-based agents have emerged as transformative tools capable of executing
complex tasks through iterative planning and action, achieving significant
advancements in understanding and addressing user needs. Yet, their
effectiveness remains limited in specialized domains such as mental health
diagnosis, where they underperform compared to general applications. Current
approaches to integrating diagnostic capabilities into LLMs rely on scarce,
highly sensitive mental health datasets, which are challenging to acquire.
These methods also fail to emulate clinicians' proactive inquiry skills, lack
multi-turn conversational comprehension, and struggle to align outputs with
expert clinical reasoning. To address these gaps, we propose DSM5AgentFlow, the
first LLM-based agent workflow designed to autonomously generate DSM-5 Level-1
diagnostic questionnaires. By simulating therapist-client dialogues with
specific client profiles, the framework delivers transparent, step-by-step
disorder predictions, producing explainable and trustworthy results. This
workflow serves as a complementary tool for mental health diagnosis, ensuring
adherence to ethical and legal standards. Through comprehensive experiments, we
evaluate leading LLMs across three critical dimensions: conversational realism,
diagnostic accuracy, and explainability. Our datasets and implementations are
fully open-sourced.

TL;DR: StyleMM是一个基于文本描述构建风格化3D可变形模型（3DMM）的新框架，通过扩散模型生成风格化图像作为目标，并保留原始面部属性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在风格化3D人脸生成中难以平衡风格多样性和面部属性一致性，StyleMM旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 结合预训练的网格变形网络和纹理生成器，通过文本引导的图像到图像翻译生成风格化目标，并保留面部属性。

Result: StyleMM在面部多样性和风格化能力上优于现有方法，支持对形状、表情和纹理的显式控制。

Conclusion: StyleMM提供了一种高效且一致的方法，用于生成风格化的3D人脸模型，适用于动画和多样化应用。

Abstract: We introduce StyleMM, a novel framework that can construct a stylized 3D
Morphable Model (3DMM) based on user-defined text descriptions specifying a
target style. Building upon a pre-trained mesh deformation network and a
texture generator for original 3DMM-based realistic human faces, our approach
fine-tunes these models using stylized facial images generated via text-guided
image-to-image (i2i) translation with a diffusion model, which serve as
stylization targets for the rendered mesh. To prevent undesired changes in
identity, facial alignment, or expressions during i2i translation, we introduce
a stylization method that explicitly preserves the facial attributes of the
source image. By maintaining these critical attributes during image
stylization, the proposed approach ensures consistent 3D style transfer across
the 3DMM parameter space through image-based training. Once trained, StyleMM
enables feed-forward generation of stylized face meshes with explicit control
over shape, expression, and texture parameters, producing meshes with
consistent vertex connectivity and animatability. Quantitative and qualitative
evaluations demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods
in terms of identity-level facial diversity and stylization capability. The

Motivation: 尽管现有的文本到图像扩散模型在生成与文本提示对齐的图像方面表现优异，但控制输出图像的视觉风格仍是一个挑战。

Method: SPG构建风格噪声向量，并利用其与无条件噪声的方向偏差来引导扩散过程朝向目标风格分布。该方法与Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG)结合，确保语义和风格的一致性。

Result: 实验表明，SPG在生成风格一致且语义准确的图像方面优于现有方法，且兼容ControlNet和IPAdapter等可控框架。

Conclusion: SPG是一种简单、鲁棒且广泛适用的方法，为风格化图像生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Although recent text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models excel at aligning
generated images with textual prompts, controlling the visual style of the
output remains a challenging task. In this work, we propose Style-Prompting
Guidance (SPG), a novel sampling strategy for style-specific image generation.
SPG constructs a style noise vector and leverages its directional deviation
from unconditional noise to guide the diffusion process toward the target style
distribution. By integrating SPG with Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), our
method achieves both semantic fidelity and style consistency. SPG is simple,
robust, and compatible with controllable frameworks like ControlNet and
IPAdapter, making it practical and widely applicable. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our approach compared to
state-of-the-art methods. Code is available at

Result: 在180万公开工作簿的评估中，TaFo生成的建议比现有系统更准确、多样且完整，性能提升15.6%--26.5%。

Conclusion: TaFo通过神经符号方法显著提升了条件格式生成的自动化水平和效果。

Abstract: Spreadsheet manipulation software are widely used for data management and
analysis of tabular data, yet the creation of conditional formatting (CF) rules
remains a complex task requiring technical knowledge and experience with
specific platforms. In this paper we present TaFo, a neuro-symbolic approach to
generating CF suggestions for tables, addressing common challenges such as user
unawareness, difficulty in rule creation, and inadequate user interfaces. TaFo
takes inspiration from component based synthesis systems and extends them with
semantic knowledge of language models and a diversity preserving rule
ranking.Unlike previous methods focused on structural formatting, TaFo uniquely
incorporates value-based formatting, automatically learning both the rule
trigger and the associated visual formatting properties for CF rules. By
removing the dependency on user specification used by existing techniques in
the form of formatted examples or natural language instruction, TaFo makes
formatting completely predictive and automated for the user. To evaluate TaFo,
we use a corpus of 1.8 Million public workbooks with CF and manual formatting.
We compare TaFo against a diverse set of symbolic and neural systems designed
for or adapted for the task of table formatting. Our results show that TaFo
generates more accurate, diverse and complete formatting suggestions than
current systems and outperforms these by 15.6\%--26.5\% on matching user added
ground truth rules in tables.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复杂疾病可能具有不同的遗传病因，但现有方法假设遗传效应同质，导致在异质性情况下功效不足。

Method: 提出HWU方法，适用于多种表型和高维遗传数据，计算高效。

Result: 模拟显示HWU在遗传异质性下表现优越，实际数据分析发现两个新基因对尼古丁依赖的异质性效应。

Conclusion: HWU是一种高效且稳健的方法，适用于遗传异质性研究。

Abstract: Converging evidence suggests that common complex diseases with the same or
similar clinical manifestations could have different underlying genetic
etiologies. While current research interests have shifted toward uncovering
rare variants and structural variations predisposing to human diseases, the
impact of heterogeneity in genetic studies of complex diseases has been largely
overlooked. Most of the existing statistical methods assume the disease under
investigation has a homogeneous genetic effect and could, therefore, have low
power if the disease undergoes heterogeneous pathophysiological and etiological
processes. In this paper, we propose a heterogeneity weighted U (HWU) method
for association analyses considering genetic heterogeneity. HWU can be applied
to various types of phenotypes (e.g., binary and continuous) and is
computationally effcient for high- dimensional genetic data. Through
simulations, we showed the advantage of HWU when the underlying genetic
etiology of a disease was heterogeneous, as well as the robustness of HWU
against different model assumptions (e.g., phenotype distributions). Using HWU,
we conducted a genome-wide analysis of nicotine dependence from the Study of
Addiction: Genetics and Environments (SAGE) dataset. The genome-wide analysis
of nearly one million genetic markers took 7 hours, identifying heterogeneous
effects of two new genes (i.e., CYP3A5 and IKBKB) on nicotine dependence.

Method: 提出GSU方法，基于相似性检验，支持高维数据和多表型分析，并提供了理论性质、p值计算及样本量/功效计算方法。

Conclusion: GSU是一种高效且稳健的方法，适用于复杂疾病的遗传关联研究，尤其适合多表型分析。

Abstract: Sequencing-based studies are emerging as a major tool for genetic association
studies of complex diseases. These studies pose great challenges to the
traditional statistical methods (e.g., single-locus analyses based on
regression methods) because of the high-dimensionality of data and the low
frequency of genetic variants. In addition, there is a great interest in
biology and epidemiology to identify genetic risk factors contributed to
multiple disease phenotypes. The multiple phenotypes can often follow different
distributions, which violates the assumptions of most current methods. In this
paper, we propose a generalized similarity U test, referred to as GSU. GSU is a
similarity-based test and can handle high-dimensional genotypes and phenotypes.
We studied the theoretical properties of GSU, and provided the efficient
p-value calculation for association test as well as the sample size and power
calculation for the study design. Through simulation, we found that GSU had
advantages over existing methods in terms of power and robustness to phenotype
distributions. Finally, we used GSU to perform a multivariate analysis of
sequencing data in the Dallas Heart Study and identified a joint association of
4 genes with 5 metabolic related phenotypes.

Conclusion: WU-SEQ成功应用于Dallas Heart Study数据，检测到ANGPTL4与极低密度脂蛋白胆固醇的关联。

Abstract: With advancements in next generation sequencing technology, a massive amount
of sequencing data are generated, offering a great opportunity to
comprehensively investigate the role of rare variants in the genetic etiology
of complex diseases. Nevertheless, this poses a great challenge for the
statistical analysis of high-dimensional sequencing data. The association
analyses based on traditional statistical methods suffer substantial power loss
because of the low frequency of genetic variants and the extremely high
dimensionality of the data. We developed a weighted U statistic, referred to as
WU-seq, for the high-dimensional association analysis of sequencing data. Based
on a non-parametric U statistic, WU-SEQ makes no assumption of the underlying
disease model and phenotype distribution, and can be applied to a variety of
phenotypes. Through simulation studies and an empirical study, we showed that
WU-SEQ outperformed a commonly used SKAT method when the underlying assumptions
were violated (e.g., the phenotype followed a heavy-tailed distribution). Even
when the assumptions were satisfied, WU-SEQ still attained comparable
performance to SKAT. Finally, we applied WU-seq to sequencing data from the
Dallas Heart Study (DHS), and detected an association between ANGPTL 4 and very
low density lipoprotein cholesterol.

Abstract: Second generation sequencing technologies are being increasingly used for
genetic association studies, where the main research interest is to identify
sets of genetic variants that contribute to various phenotype. The phenotype
can be univariate disease status, multivariate responses and even
high-dimensional outcomes. Considering the genotype and phenotype as two
complex objects, this also poses a general statistical problem of testing
association between complex objects. We here proposed a similarity-based test,
generalized similarity U (GSU), that can test the association between complex
objects. We first studied the theoretical properties of the test in a general
setting and then focused on the application of the test to sequencing
association studies. Based on theoretical analysis, we proposed to use
Laplacian kernel based similarity for GSU to boost power and enhance
robustness. Through simulation, we found that GSU did have advantages over
existing methods in terms of power and robustness. We further performed a whole
genome sequencing (WGS) scan for Alzherimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative
(ADNI) data, identifying three genes, APOE, APOC1 and TOMM40, associated with
imaging phenotype. We developed a C++ package for analysis of whole genome
sequencing data using GSU. The source codes can be downloaded at

Conclusion: 代码扩散模型可用于最后一英里修复，并能生成高效训练数据。

Abstract: Code diffusion models generate code by iteratively removing noise from the
latent representation of a code snippet. During later steps of the diffusion
process, when the code snippet has almost converged, differences between
discrete representations of these snippets look like last-mile repairs applied
to broken or incomplete code. We evaluate the extent to which this resemblance
can be exploited to leverage pre-trained code diffusion models for the problem
of last-mile repair by considering two applications with significant potential.
First, we can leverage the diffusion model for last-mile repair by adding noise
to a broken code snippet and resuming the diffusion process. Second, we can
leverage the diffusion model to generate arbitrary amount of training data for
last-mile repair tasks (that are computationally more efficient) by sampling an
intermediate program (input) and the final program (output) from the diffusion
process. We perform experiments on 3 domains (Python, Excel and PowerShell) to
evaluate applications, as well as analyze properties.

Conclusion: ORFuzz和ORFuzzSet为开发更可靠的LLM系统提供了自动化测试框架和社区资源。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly exhibit over-refusal - erroneously
rejecting benign queries due to overly conservative safety measures - a
critical functional flaw that undermines their reliability and usability.
Current methods for testing this behavior are demonstrably inadequate,
suffering from flawed benchmarks and limited test generation capabilities, as
highlighted by our empirical user study. To the best of our knowledge, this
paper introduces the first evolutionary testing framework, ORFuzz, for the
systematic detection and analysis of LLM over-refusals. ORFuzz uniquely
integrates three core components: (1) safety category-aware seed selection for
comprehensive test coverage, (2) adaptive mutator optimization using reasoning
LLMs to generate effective test cases, and (3) OR-Judge, a human-aligned judge
model validated to accurately reflect user perception of toxicity and refusal.
Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that ORFuzz generates diverse, validated
over-refusal instances at a rate (6.98% average) more than double that of
leading baselines, effectively uncovering vulnerabilities. Furthermore,
ORFuzz's outputs form the basis of ORFuzzSet, a new benchmark of 1,855 highly
transferable test cases that achieves a superior 63.56% average over-refusal
rate across 10 diverse LLMs, significantly outperforming existing datasets.
ORFuzz and ORFuzzSet provide a robust automated testing framework and a
valuable community resource, paving the way for developing more reliable and
trustworthy LLM-based software systems.

TL;DR: 论文研究大型语言模型（LLMs）在代码生成中的幻觉现象，特别是在汽车领域。通过案例研究评估不同提示复杂度下的模型表现，发现GPT-4.1和GPT-4o在上下文丰富的提示下表现最佳，但仍需缓解技术以确保可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在代码生成中潜力巨大，但因幻觉问题（如输出看似合理但实际错误）限制了实际应用。本文旨在研究这一问题，特别是在汽车领域。

Method: 通过案例研究，评估多种代码LLMs（如GPT-4.1、Codex、GPT-4o）在不同提示复杂度下的表现，从简单提示到包含额外上下文和代码骨架的复杂提示。

Result: 评估显示，即使是先进模型也频繁出现语法错误、无效引用和API知识冲突。仅GPT-4.1和GPT-4o在上下文丰富的提示下能生成正确代码。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在安全关键领域（如汽车软件）中，需开发有效缓解技术以确保LLM生成代码的安全性和可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant potential in automating
code generation tasks offering new opportunities across software engineering
domains. However, their practical application remains limited due to
hallucinations - outputs that appear plausible but are factually incorrect,
unverifiable or nonsensical. This paper investigates hallucination phenomena in
the context of code generation with a specific focus on the automotive domain.
A case study is presented that evaluates multiple code LLMs for three different
prompting complexities ranging from a minimal one-liner prompt to a prompt with
Covesa Vehicle Signal Specifications (VSS) as additional context and finally to
a prompt with an additional code skeleton. The evaluation reveals a high
frequency of syntax violations, invalid reference errors and API knowledge
conflicts in state-of-the-art models GPT-4.1, Codex and GPT-4o. Among the
evaluated models, only GPT-4.1 and GPT-4o were able to produce a correct
solution when given the most context-rich prompt. Simpler prompting strategies
failed to yield a working result, even after multiple refinement iterations.
These findings highlight the need for effective mitigation techniques to ensure
the safe and reliable use of LLM generated code, especially in safety-critical
domains such as automotive software systems.

Main category: stat.AP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种功能方差分析（FANOVA）方法，用于测试基因组区域序列变异与定性性状的关联，优于现有方法SKAT和FLM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管已识别出与人类疾病相关的常见遗传变异，但对大多数复杂疾病而言，这些变异仅解释了遗传力的一小部分，仍需发现更多未知变异。

Method: 提出FANOVA方法，联合测试基因变异的效应，充分利用连锁不平衡和遗传位置信息，并允许保护性或风险增加的因果变异。

Result: 模拟显示FANOVA在小样本或变异效应低至中等时优于SKAT和FLM。实证研究中，FANOVA成功识别出与肥胖相关的两个基因（ANGPTL 4和ANGPTL 3），而其他方法仅检测到一个。

Conclusion: FANOVA是一种高效且强大的方法，适用于复杂疾病遗传变异的关联分析。

Abstract: While progress has been made in identifying common genetic variants
associated with human diseases, for most of common complex diseases, the
identified genetic variants only account for a small proportion of
heritability. Challenges remain in finding additional unknown genetic variants
predisposing to complex diseases. With the advance in next-generation
sequencing technologies, sequencing studies have become commonplace in genetic
research. The ongoing exome-sequencing and whole-genome-sequencing studies
generate a massive amount of sequencing variants and allow researchers to
comprehensively investigate their role in human diseases. The discovery of new
disease-associated variants can be enhanced by utilizing powerful and
computationally efficient statistical methods. In this paper, we propose a
functional analysis of variance (FANOVA) method for testing an association of
sequence variants in a genomic region with a qualitative trait. The FANOVA has
a number of advantages: (1) it tests for a joint effect of gene variants,
including both common and rare; (2) it fully utilizes linkage disequilibrium
and genetic position information; and (3) allows for either protective or
risk-increasing causal variants. Through simulations, we show that FANOVA
outperform two popularly used methods - SKAT and a previously proposed method
based on functional linear models (FLM), - especially if a sample size of a
study is small and/or sequence variants have low to moderate effects. We
conduct an empirical study by applying three methods (FANOVA, SKAT and FLM) to
sequencing data from Dallas Heart Study. While SKAT and FLM respectively
detected ANGPTL 4 and ANGPTL 3 associated with obesity, FANOVA was able to
identify both genes associated with obesity.

Abstract: With the rapid development of spatial audio technologies today, applications
in AR, VR, and other scenarios have garnered extensive attention. Unlike
traditional mono sound, spatial audio offers a more realistic and immersive
auditory experience. Despite notable progress in the field, there remains a

*Sheng Wong,Beth Albert,Gabriel Davis Jones*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: CleanCTG是一个双阶段模型，用于识别和校正胎儿监护中的伪影，显著提升信号质量，减少误诊风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前胎儿监护中的伪影问题导致信号失真，传统方法和深度学习未能全面解决。

Method: 采用多尺度卷积和上下文感知交叉注意力识别伪影，并通过特定校正分支重建信号。

Result: 在合成数据上完美检测伪影（AU-ROC=1.00），临床验证中AU-ROC=0.95，决策时间缩短33%。

Conclusion: CleanCTG通过显式伪影去除和信号重建，提高了诊断准确性和效率。

Abstract: Cardiotocography (CTG) is essential for fetal monitoring but is frequently
compromised by diverse artefacts which obscure true fetal heart rate (FHR)
patterns and can lead to misdiagnosis or delayed intervention. Current
deep-learning approaches typically bypass comprehensive noise handling,
applying minimal preprocessing or focusing solely on downstream classification,
while traditional methods rely on simple interpolation or rule-based filtering
that addresses only missing samples and fail to correct complex artefact types.
We present CleanCTG, an end-to-end dual-stage model that first identifies
multiple artefact types via multi-scale convolution and context-aware
cross-attention, then reconstructs corrupted segments through artefact-specific
correction branches. Training utilised over 800,000 minutes of physiologically
realistic, synthetically corrupted CTGs derived from expert-verified "clean"
recordings. On synthetic data, CleanCTG achieved perfect artefact detection
(AU-ROC = 1.00) and reduced mean squared error (MSE) on corrupted segments to
2.74 x 10^-4 (clean-segment MSE = 2.40 x 10^-6), outperforming the next best
method by more than 60%. External validation on 10,190 minutes of
clinician-annotated segments yielded AU-ROC = 0.95 (sensitivity = 83.44%,
specificity 94.22%), surpassing six comparator classifiers. Finally, when
integrated with the Dawes-Redman system on 933 clinical CTG recordings,
denoised traces increased specificity (from 80.70% to 82.70%) and shortened
median time to decision by 33%. These findings suggest that explicit artefact
removal and signal reconstruction can both maintain diagnostic accuracy and
enable shorter monitoring sessions, offering a practical route to more reliable
CTG interpretation.

<details>

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注语音内容检索，而本文旨在通过语音风格（表达方式）进行检索。

Method: 训练语音和文本编码器，将语音和文本风格描述嵌入到联合潜在空间，支持自由文本查询。

Result: 在包含22种语音风格的多数据集上，实验表明该方法在Recall@k指标上表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法有效实现了基于语音风格的检索，并通过多种分析验证了其性能。

Abstract: We introduce the task of expressive speech retrieval, where the goal is to
retrieve speech utterances spoken in a given style based on a natural language
description of that style. While prior work has primarily focused on performing
speech retrieval based on what was said in an utterance, we aim to do so based
on how something was said. We train speech and text encoders to embed speech
and text descriptions of speaking styles into a joint latent space, which
enables using free-form text prompts describing emotions or styles as queries
to retrieve matching expressive speech segments. We perform detailed analyses
of various aspects of our proposed framework, including encoder architectures,
training criteria for effective cross-modal alignment, and prompt augmentation
for improved generalization to arbitrary text queries. Experiments on multiple
datasets encompassing 22 speaking styles demonstrate that our approach achieves
strong retrieval performance as measured by Recall@k.

TL;DR: MoE-TTS是一种基于描述的文本转语音模型，通过混合专家（MoE）方法增强预训练语言模型，以更好地处理域外文本描述。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有TTS模型在处理用户生成的域外文本描述时表现不佳的问题。

Method: 采用模态混合专家（MoE）方法，在冻结预训练语言模型的同时，引入适应语音模态的专用权重。

Result: 实验表明，MoE-TTS在生成语音时能更准确地反映描述内容，优于现有商业产品。

Conclusion: MoE-TTS通过结合预训练语言模型和专用权重，显著提升了域外文本描述的理解能力。

Abstract: Description-based text-to-speech (TTS) models exhibit strong performance on
in-domain text descriptions, i.e., those encountered during training. However,
in real-world applications, the diverse range of user-generated descriptions
inevitably introduces numerous out-of-domain inputs that challenge the text
understanding capabilities of these systems. To address this issue, we propose
MoE-TTS, a description-based TTS model designed to enhance the understanding of
out-of-domain text descriptions. MoE-TTS employs a modality-based
mixture-of-experts (MoE) approach to augment a pre-trained textual large
language model (LLM) with a set of specialized weights adapted to the speech
modality while maintaining the original LLM frozen during training. This
approach allows MoE-TTS to effectively leverage the pre-trained knowledge and
text understanding abilities of textual LLMs. Our experimental results indicate
that: first, even the most advanced closed-source commercial products can be
challenged by carefully designed out-of-domain description test sets; second,
MoE-TTS achieves superior performance in generating speech that more accurately
reflects the descriptions. We encourage readers to listen to the demos at

TL;DR: 研究现代语音模型是否对韵律重音敏感，提出基于残差的框架分析重音编码方式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨语音模型如何系统性地编码重音与非重音词汇，弥补现有研究仅依赖孤立声学特征或标签预测的不足。

Method: 提出残差框架，将重音定义为成对中性词与重音词表征的差异，分析自监督语音模型中的残差表现。

Result: 残差与时长变化强相关，且词身份预测表现差，表明重音编码具有结构化特性。ASR微调模型中残差子空间更紧凑，表明任务学习使重音编码更结构化。

Conclusion: 现代语音模型通过低维变换结构化编码韵律重音，任务学习进一步优化其编码方式。

Abstract: This work investigates whether modern speech models are sensitive to prosodic
emphasis - whether they encode emphasized and neutral words in systematically
different ways. Prior work typically relies on isolated acoustic correlates
(e.g., pitch, duration) or label prediction, both of which miss the relational
structure of emphasis. This paper proposes a residual-based framework, defining
emphasis as the difference between paired neutral and emphasized word
representations. Analysis on self-supervised speech models shows that these
residuals correlate strongly with duration changes and perform poorly at word
identity prediction, indicating a structured, relational encoding of prosodic
emphasis. In ASR fine-tuned models, residuals occupy a subspace up to 50% more
compact than in pre-trained models, further suggesting that emphasis is encoded
as a consistent, low-dimensional transformation that becomes more structured
with task-specific learning.

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效减少了推理延迟，为边缘设备部署大型语言模型提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: While deploying large language models on edge devices promises low-latency
and privacy-preserving AI services, it is hindered by limited device resources.
Although pipeline parallelism facilitates distributed inference, existing
approaches often ignore the cold-start latency caused by on-demand model
loading. In this paper, we propose a latency-aware scheduling framework that
overlaps model loading with computation and communication to minimize total
inference latency. Based on device and model parameters, the framework
dynamically adjusts layer partitioning and allocation to effectively hide
loading time, thereby eliminating as many idle periods as possible. We
formulate the problem as a Mixed-Integer Non-Linear Program and design an
efficient dynamic programming algorithm to optimize model partitioning and
device assignment. Experimental results show that the proposed method
significantly reduces cold-start latency compared to baseline strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无线通信与大型语言模型（LLM）结合可提供智能服务，但在无线边缘设备协作环境中，推理质量与端到端延迟之间存在矛盾。

Method: 采用轻量级移动设备模型和强大边缘服务器模型的动态路由框架，针对单轮查询和多轮对话分别设计成本模型。

Result: 在保持推理质量的同时，平均响应延迟降低5-15%，大型模型调用减少10-20%。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了资源分配与任务复杂性不匹配的问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: The integration of wireless communications and Large Language Models (LLMs)
is poised to unlock ubiquitous intelligent services, yet deploying them in
wireless edge-device collaborative environments presents a critical trade-off
between inference quality and end-to-end latency. A fundamental mismatch exists
between task complexity and resource allocation: offloading simple queries
invites prohibitive latency, while on-device models lack the capacity for
demanding computations. To address this challenge, we propose a dynamic,
quality-latency aware routing framework that orchestrates inference between a
lightweight model on the mobile device and a powerful model on the edge server.
Our framework employs two distinct cost models: for single-turn queries, it
fuses a BERT-predicted semantic score with communication and computation
overheads; for multi-turn dialogues, it further quantifies context-aware costs
arising from model switching and KV-cache management. While maintaining full
inference quality, extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework cuts
average response latency by 5-15% and reduces large model invocations by 10-20%
against competitive baselines on MMLU, GSM8K, and MT-Bench-101 benchmarks.

Conclusion: 该方法能显著提升血流图像质量，为医学诊断提供更可靠的数据支持。

Abstract: Blood flow imaging provides important information for hemodynamic behavior
within the vascular system and plays an essential role in medical diagnosis and
treatment planning. However, obtaining high-quality flow images remains a
significant challenge. In this work, we address the problem of denoising flow
images that may suffer from artifacts due to short acquisition times or
device-induced errors. We formulate this task as an optimization problem, where
the objective is to minimize the discrepancy between the modeled velocity
field, constrained to satisfy the Navier-Stokes equations, and the observed
noisy velocity data. To solve this problem, we decompose it into two
subproblems: a fluid subproblem and a geometry subproblem. The fluid subproblem
leverages a Physics-Informed Neural Network to reconstruct the velocity field
from noisy observations, assuming a fixed domain. The geometry subproblem aims
to infer the underlying flow region by optimizing a quasi-conformal mapping
that deforms a reference domain. These two subproblems are solved in an
alternating Gauss-Seidel fashion, iteratively refining both the velocity field
and the domain. Upon convergence, the framework yields a high-quality
reconstruction of the flow image. We validate the proposed method through
experiments on synthetic flow data in a converging channel geometry under
varying levels of Gaussian noise, and on real-like flow data in an aortic
geometry with signal-dependent noise. The results demonstrate the effectiveness
and robustness of the approach. Additionally, ablation studies are conducted to
assess the influence of key hyperparameters.

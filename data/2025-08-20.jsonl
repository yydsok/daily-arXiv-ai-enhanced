Extensive experiments on two\nlarge-scale multi-view driving benchmarks, DriveLM and DriveLMM-o1, show that\nPrune2Drive achieves significant speedups and memory savings while maintaining\nor improving task performance. When retaining only 10% of the visual tokens,\nour method achieves a 6.40$\\times$ speedup in the prefilling phase and consumes\n13.4% of the original FLOPs, with only a 3% performance drop on the DriveLM\nbenchmark."}

We refer to these environments as ``Social Mini-Games'' (SMGs). SMGs\nare tightly coupled, high-agency interactions that arise within general\nmulti-robot navigation (MRN) scenarios. They are identified through certain\ndistinct characteristics and require specialized metrics to evaluate them.\nTraditional navigation approaches designed for MRN do not perform well in SMGs,\nwhich has led to focused research on dedicated SMG solvers (navigation methods\nspecialized to navigate in SMGs), which has flourished in recent years.\nHowever, publications on SMG navigation research make different assumptions (on\ncentralized versus decentralized, observability, communication, cooperation,\netc.), and have different objective functions (safety versus liveness). These\nassumptions and objectives are sometimes implicitly assumed or described\ninformally. This makes it difficult to establish appropriate baselines for\ncomparison in research papers, as well as making it difficult for practitioners\nto find the papers relevant to their concrete application.

Second, we introduce a three-level whole-body\ndisturbance rejection control framework (T-WB-DRC).

We propose a two-dimensional framework for trust-equivalence\nevaluation. First, interpretability alignment measures whether the models base\ntheir predictions on the same input features. We use LIME and SHAP tests to\nmeasure the interpretability alignment. Second, calibration similarity measures\nwhether the models exhibit comparable reliability in their predicted\nprobabilities.

For case (a), we\npropose a simple adaptation of the FM objective with an additional term that\npenalizes the distance between the constraint set and the generated samples.\nFor case (b), we propose to employ randomization and learn a mean flow that is\nnumerically shown to have a high likelihood of satisfying the constraints.

Current\nstate-of-the-art neural planning approaches struggle with complex domains,\nproducing plans with missing preconditions, inconsistent goals, and\nhallucinations. While classical planners provide logical guarantees, they lack\nthe flexibility and natural language understanding capabilities needed for\nmodern autonomous systems. Existing neuro-symbolic approaches use one-shot\ntranslation from natural language to formal plans, missing the opportunity for\nneural and symbolic components to work and refine solutions together. To\naddress this gap, we develop LOOP -- a novel neuro-symbolic planning framework\nthat treats planning as an iterative conversation between neural and symbolic\ncomponents rather than simple translation. LOOP integrates 13 coordinated\nneural features including graph neural networks for spatial relationships,\nmulti-agent validation for consensus-based correctness, hierarchical\ndecomposition for complex task management, and causal memory that learns from\nboth successes and failures. Unlike existing approaches, LOOP generates PDDL\nspecifications, refines them iteratively based on symbolic feedback, and builds\na causal knowledge base from execution traces. LOOP was evaluated on six\nstandard IPC benchmark domains, where it achieved 85.8% success rate compared\nto LLM+P (55.0%), LLM-as-Planner (19.2%), and Tree-of-Thoughts (3.3%). This\nwork shows that the key to reliable planning is not in choosing between neural\nnetworks or symbolic reasoners but it lies in making them actually ``talk'' to\neach other during the entire process.

We formulate this as a mixed-integer program and\nintroduce J3O (Joint Optimization of Onloading and Offloading), an alternating\nalgorithm that (i) greedily selects models to onload via Lagrangian-relaxed\nsubmodular optimization and (ii) determines optimal offloading via constrained\nlinear programming. We further extend J3O to account for batching at the edge,\nmaintaining scalability under heterogeneous task loads. Experiments show J3O\nconsistently achieves over $97\\%$ of the optimal accuracy while incurring less\nthan $15\\%$ of the runtime required by the optimal solver across multi-task\nbenchmarks."}

We conducted a comparative analysis\nacross psycholinguistic text properties, including word frequency, lexical\nrichness, sentence and word length, part-of-speech tags, and semantic\nsimilarity with word embeddings. The results show that LLM-generated texts are\nlonger but less lexically rich, rely more on high-frequency words, and\nunder-represent nouns. Semantic vector space analysis revealed low similarity,\nhighlighting differences between the two corpora on the level of corpus\nsemantics. Few-shot prompt increased similarities between children and LLM text\nto a minor extent, but still failed to replicate lexical and semantic patterns.\nThe findings contribute to our understanding of how LLMs approximate child\nlanguage through multimodal prompting (text + image) and give insights into\ntheir use in psycholinguistic research and education while raising important\nquestions about the appropriateness of LLM-generated language in child-directed\neducational tools."}

Practical applications have driven the development of various\nautomatic evaluation metrics (AEM), designed to compare the model output with\nhuman-written references, generating a score which approximates human judgment.\nOver time, AEMs have evolved from simple lexical comparisons, to semantic\nsimilarity models and, more recently, to LLM-based evaluators. However, it\nseems that no single metric has emerged as a definitive solution, resulting in\nstudies using different ones without fully considering the implications. This\npaper aims to show this by conducting a thorough examination of the\nmethodologies of existing metrics, their documented strengths and limitations,\nvalidation methods, and correlations with human judgment. We identify several\nkey challenges: metrics often capture only specific aspects of text quality,\ntheir effectiveness varies by task and dataset, validation practices remain\nunstructured, and correlations with human judgment are inconsistent.\nImportantly, we find that these challenges persist in the most recent type of\nmetric, LLM-as-a-Judge, as well as in the evaluation of Retrieval Augmented\nGeneration (RAG), an increasingly relevant task in academia and industry.

To address these challenges, we propose a novel Instance-based Transfer\nLearning LIME framework (ITL-LIME) that enhances explanation fidelity and\nstability in data-constrained environments. ITL-LIME introduces instance\ntransfer learning into the LIME framework by leveraging relevant real instances\nfrom a related source domain to aid the explanation process in the target\ndomain. Specifically, we employ clustering to partition the source domain into\nclusters with representative prototypes. Instead of generating random\nperturbations, our method retrieves pertinent real source instances from the\nsource cluster whose prototype is most similar to the target instance. These\nare then combined with the target instance's neighboring real instances. To\ndefine a compact locality, we further construct a contrastive learning-based\nencoder as a weighting mechanism to assign weights to the instances from the\ncombined set based on their proximity to the target instance.

The sophisticated\nanalysis of patient-generated health content, which contains complex emotional\nand medical contexts, requires scarce domain expertise, while traditional ML\napproaches are constrained by data shortage and privacy limitations in\nhealthcare settings. Online Health Communities (OHCs) exemplify these\nchallenges with mixed-sentiment posts, clinical terminology, and implicit\nemotional expressions that demand specialised knowledge for accurate Sentiment\nAnalysis (SA). To address these challenges, this study explores how Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) can integrate expert knowledge through in-context\nlearning for SA, providing a scalable solution for sophisticated health data\nanalysis. Specifically, we develop a structured codebook that systematically\nencodes expert interpretation guidelines, enabling LLMs to apply\ndomain-specific knowledge through targeted prompting rather than extensive\ntraining. Six GPT models validated alongside DeepSeek and LLaMA 3.1 are\ncompared with pre-trained language models (BioBERT variants) and lexicon-based\nmethods, using 400 expert-annotated posts from two OHCs. LLMs achieve superior\nperformance while demonstrating expert-level agreement. This high agreement,\nwith no statistically significant difference from inter-expert agreement\nlevels, suggests knowledge integration beyond surface-level pattern\nrecognition. The consistent performance across diverse LLM models, supported by\nin-context learning, offers a promising solution for digital health analytics.\nThis approach addresses the critical challenge of expert knowledge shortage in\ndigital health research, enabling real-time, expert-quality analysis for\npatient monitoring, intervention assessment, and evidence-based health\nstrategies."}

While mobile network servers have ample\ncomputational resources to support larger models than client devices, privacy\nconstraints prevent clients from directly sharing their raw data. Federated\nLearning (FL) enables decentralized clients to collaboratively train a shared\nmodel by exchanging model parameters instead of transmitting raw data.

To address these challenges, we propose\nFedOL, to construct a larger and more comprehensive server model in one-shot\nsettings (i.e., in a single communication round). Instead of model parameter\nsharing, FedOL employs knowledge distillation, where clients only exchange\nmodel prediction outputs on an unlabeled public dataset. This reduces\ncommunication overhead by transmitting compact predictions instead of full\nmodel weights and enables model customization by allowing heterogeneous model\narchitectures. A key challenge in this setting is that client predictions may\nbe biased due to skewed local data distributions, and the lack of ground-truth\nlabels in the public dataset further complicates reliable learning. To mitigate\nthese issues, FedOL introduces a specialized objective function that\niteratively refines pseudo-labels and the server model, improving learning\nreliability.

Previous work proposed a framework consisting of\nthree steps: the LLM first generates a summary and then a strategy for the\ndomain, both in natural language, and then implements that strategy as a Python\nprogram, that gets debugged on example planning tasks. In that work, only one\nstrategy is generated and passed directly to the program generation. If the\nstrategy is incorrect, its implementation will therefore result in an incorrect\ngeneralized plan. Here, we introduce an approach that generates the strategy in\nthe form of pseudocode and enables automatic debugging of the pseudocode, hence\nallowing us to identify and fix errors prior to the generation of the\ngeneralized plan itself.

However, the nature of many\npractical decision-making problems favors a multimodal policy that facilitates\nrobust exploration of the environment and thus to address learning challenges\narising from sparse rewards, complex dynamics, or the need for strategic\nadaptation to varying contexts. This issue is exacerbated in continuous control\ndomains where exploration usually takes place in the vicinity of the predicted\noptimal action, either through an additive Gaussian noise or the sampling\nprocess of a stochastic policy. In this paper, we introduce Categorical\nPolicies to model multimodal behavior modes with an intermediate categorical\ndistribution, and then generate output action that is conditioned on the\nsampled mode. We explore two sampling schemes that ensure differentiable\ndiscrete latent structure while maintaining efficient gradient-based\noptimization. By utilizing a latent categorical distribution to select the\nbehavior mode, our approach naturally expresses multimodality while remaining\nfully differentiable via the sampling tricks. We evaluate our multimodal policy\non a set of DeepMind Control Suite environments, demonstrating that through\nbetter exploration, our learned policies converge faster and outperform\nstandard Gaussian policies.

At the output of the backbone, ViT-FIQA branches into two\nheads: (1) the patch tokens are passed through a fully connected layer to learn\ndiscriminative face representations via a margin-penalty softmax loss, and (2)\nthe quality token is fed into a regression head to learn to predict the face\nsample's utility. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks and several\nFR models, including both CNN- and ViT-based architectures, demonstrate that\nViT-FIQA consistently achieves top-tier performance. These results underscore\nthe effectiveness of transformer-based architectures in modeling face image\nutility and highlight the potential of ViTs as a scalable foundation for future\nFIQA research https://cutt.ly/irHlzXUC."}

Addressing timing violations at this early stage is essential, as\nmodern systems demand higher speeds, where even minor timing violations can\nlead to functional failures or system crashes. However, traditional timing\noptimization heavily relies on manual expertise, requiring engineers to\niteratively analyze timing reports and debug. To automate this process, this\npaper proposes ViTAD, a method that efficiently analyzes the root causes of\ntiming violations and dynamically generates targeted repair strategies.\nSpecifically, we first parse Verilog code and timing reports to construct a\nSignal Timing Dependency Graph (STDG). Based on the STDG, we perform violation\npath analysis and use large language models (LLMs) to infer the root causes of\nviolations. Finally, by analyzing the causes of violations, we selectively\nretrieve relevant debugging knowledge from a domain-specific knowledge base to\ngenerate customized repair solutions. To evaluate the effectiveness of our\nmethod, we construct a timing violation dataset based on real-world open-source\nprojects. This dataset contains 54 cases of violations.

Our framework orchestrates two large Vision-Language Models\n(VLMs): GPT-4o and o3-mini, using a structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) strategy\nto produce rich, multi-perspective outputs. These outputs serve as\nknowledge-enriched pseudo-annotations for supervised fine-tuning of a much\nsmaller student VLM. The resulting compact 3B-scale model, named VISTA (Vision\nfor Intelligent Scene and Traffic Analysis), is capable of understanding\nlow-resolution traffic videos and generating semantically faithful, risk-aware\ncaptions. Despite its significantly reduced parameter count, VISTA achieves\nstrong performance across established captioning metrics (BLEU-4, METEOR,\nROUGE-L, and CIDEr) when benchmarked against its teacher models. This\ndemonstrates that effective knowledge distillation and structured multi-agent\nsupervision can empower lightweight VLMs to capture complex reasoning\ncapabilities. The compact architecture of VISTA facilitates efficient\ndeployment on edge devices, enabling real-time risk monitoring without\nrequiring extensive infrastructure upgrades."}

Nowadays, financial decisions are shaped by external\npressures like obligatory consumption, algorithmic persuasion, and unstable\nwork schedules that erode financial autonomy. Obligatory consumption (like\nhidden fees) is intensified by digital ecosystems. Algorithmic tactics like\npersonalized recommendations lead to impulsive purchases. Unstable work\nschedules also undermine financial planning. Thus, it is important to study how\nthese factors impact consumption agency. To do so, we examine formal models\ngrounded in discounted consumption with constraints that bound agency. We\nconstruct analytical scenarios in which consumers face obligatory payments,\nalgorithm-influenced impulsive expenses, or unpredictable income due to\ntemporal instability. Using this framework, we demonstrate that even rational,\nutility-maximizing agents can experience early financial ruin when agency is\nlimited across structural, behavioral, or temporal dimensions and how\ndiminished autonomy impacts long-term financial well-being. Our central\nargument is that consumer agency must be treated as a value (not a given)\nrequiring active cultivation, especially in digital ecosystems. The connection\nbetween our formal modeling and this argument allows us to indicate that\nlimitations on agency (whether structural, behavioral, or temporal) can be\nrigorously linked to measurable risks like financial instability. This\nconnection is also a basis for normative claims about consumption as a value,\nby anchoring them in a formally grounded analysis of consumer behavior.

Experiments demonstrate that MimicFunc effectively\nenables the robot to generalize the skill from a single RGB-D human video to\nmanipulating novel tools for functionally equivalent tasks. Furthermore,\nleveraging MimicFunc's one-shot generalization capability, the generated\nrollouts can be used to train visuomotor policies without requiring\nlabor-intensive teleoperation data collection for novel objects.

To handle viewpoint changes, we perform a detailed analysis and\nmanipulation of the 3D information in the video. Specifically, we utilize a\ndense stereo method to estimate a point cloud and the camera parameters of the\ninput video. We then propose a point cloud editing approach that uses depth\nmaps to represent the 3D geometry of newly edited components, aligning them\neffectively with the original 3D scene.

To mitigate\nthese issues, FedOL introduces a specialized objective function that\niteratively refines pseudo-labels and the server model, improving learning\nreliability.

An example is collaborative\nlearning, which aims to train a global model based on data from individual\nagents. A major challenge in designing such systems is to guarantee safety and\nalignment with human values, particularly a fair distribution of rewards upon\nachieving the global goal. Cooperative game theory offers useful abstractions\nof cooperating agents via value functions, which assign value to each\ncoalition, and via reward functions. With these, the idea of fair allocation\ncan be formalized by specifying fairness axioms and designing concrete\nmechanisms. Classical cooperative game theory, exemplified by the Shapley\nvalue, does not fully capture scenarios like collaborative learning, as it\nassumes nonreplicable resources, whereas data and models can be replicated.\nInfinite replicability requires a generalized notion of fairness, formalized\nthrough new axioms and mechanisms. These must address imbalances in reciprocal\nbenefits among participants, which can lead to strategic exploitation and\nunfair allocations. The main contribution of this paper is a mechanism and a\nproof that it fulfills the property of mutual fairness, formalized by the\nBalanced Reciprocity Axiom. It ensures that, for every pair of players, each\nbenefits equally from the participation of the other."}

We refer to these environments as ``Social Mini-Games'' (SMGs). SMGs\nare tightly coupled, high-agency interactions that arise within general\nmulti-robot navigation (MRN) scenarios. They are identified through certain\ndistinct characteristics and require specialized metrics to evaluate them.\nTraditional navigation approaches designed for MRN do not perform well in SMGs,\nwhich has led to focused research on dedicated SMG solvers (navigation methods\nspecialized to navigate in SMGs), which has flourished in recent years.\nHowever, publications on SMG navigation research make different assumptions (on\ncentralized versus decentralized, observability, communication, cooperation,\netc.), and have different objective functions (safety versus liveness).

Current\nstate-of-the-art neural planning approaches struggle with complex domains,\nproducing plans with missing preconditions, inconsistent goals, and\nhallucinations. While classical planners provide logical guarantees, they lack\nthe flexibility and natural language understanding capabilities needed for\nmodern autonomous systems. Existing neuro-symbolic approaches use one-shot\ntranslation from natural language to formal plans, missing the opportunity for\nneural and symbolic components to work and refine solutions together. To\naddress this gap, we develop LOOP -- a novel neuro-symbolic planning framework\nthat treats planning as an iterative conversation between neural and symbolic\ncomponents rather than simple translation. LOOP integrates 13 coordinated\nneural features including graph neural networks for spatial relationships,\nmulti-agent validation for consensus-based correctness, hierarchical\ndecomposition for complex task management, and causal memory that learns from\nboth successes and failures. Unlike existing approaches, LOOP generates PDDL\nspecifications, refines them iteratively based on symbolic feedback, and builds\na causal knowledge base from execution traces. LOOP was evaluated on six\nstandard IPC benchmark domains, where it achieved 85.8% success rate compared\nto LLM+P (55.0%), LLM-as-Planner (19.2%), and Tree-of-Thoughts (3.3%).

The 2025 edition featured four tracks and saw a 17% increase in\nparticipation, with 245 teams from 15 countries registered on the evaluation\nserver. Public release of challenge datasets led to over 30,000 downloads to\ndate. Track 1 focused on multi-class 3D multi-camera tracking, involving\npeople, humanoids, autonomous mobile robots, and forklifts, using detailed\ncalibration and 3D bounding box annotations. Track 2 tackled video question\nanswering in traffic safety, with multi-camera incident understanding enriched\nby 3D gaze labels. Track 3 addressed fine-grained spatial reasoning in dynamic\nwarehouse environments, requiring AI systems to interpret RGB-D inputs and\nanswer spatial questions that combine perception, geometry, and language. Both\nTrack 1 and Track 3 datasets were generated in NVIDIA Omniverse. Track 4\nemphasized efficient road object detection from fisheye cameras, supporting\nlightweight, real-time deployment on edge devices. The evaluation framework\nenforced submission limits and used a partially held-out test set to ensure\nfair benchmarking.

Accepted to RANLP 2025", "summary": "Evaluating Natural Language Generation (NLG) is crucial for the practical\nadoption of AI, but has been a longstanding research challenge. While human\nevaluation is considered the de-facto standard, it is expensive and lacks\nscalability. Practical applications have driven the development of various\nautomatic evaluation metrics (AEM), designed to compare the model output with\nhuman-written references, generating a score which approximates human judgment.\nOver time, AEMs have evolved from simple lexical comparisons, to semantic\nsimilarity models and, more recently, to LLM-based evaluators. However, it\nseems that no single metric has emerged as a definitive solution, resulting in\nstudies using different ones without fully considering the implications. This\npaper aims to show this by conducting a thorough examination of the\nmethodologies of existing metrics, their documented strengths and limitations,\nvalidation methods, and correlations with human judgment. We identify several\nkey challenges: metrics often capture only specific aspects of text quality,\ntheir effectiveness varies by task and dataset, validation practices remain\nunstructured, and correlations with human judgment are inconsistent.\nImportantly, we find that these challenges persist in the most recent type of\nmetric, LLM-as-a-Judge, as well as in the evaluation of Retrieval Augmented\nGeneration (RAG), an increasingly relevant task in academia and industry. Our\nfindings challenge the quest for the 'perfect metric'. We propose selecting\nmetrics based on task-specific needs and leveraging complementary evaluations\nand advocate that new metrics should focus on enhanced validation\nmethodologies."}

However, LIME's inherent\nrandomness in perturbation and sampling can lead to locality and instability\nissues, especially in scenarios with limited training data. In such cases, data\nscarcity can result in the generation of unrealistic variations and samples\nthat deviate from the true data manifold. Consequently, the surrogate model may\nfail to accurately approximate the complex decision boundary of the original\nmodel. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Instance-based Transfer\nLearning LIME framework (ITL-LIME) that enhances explanation fidelity and\nstability in data-constrained environments. ITL-LIME introduces instance\ntransfer learning into the LIME framework by leveraging relevant real instances\nfrom a related source domain to aid the explanation process in the target\ndomain. Specifically, we employ clustering to partition the source domain into\nclusters with representative prototypes. Instead of generating random\nperturbations, our method retrieves pertinent real source instances from the\nsource cluster whose prototype is most similar to the target instance. These\nare then combined with the target instance's neighboring real instances. To\ndefine a compact locality, we further construct a contrastive learning-based\nencoder as a weighting mechanism to assign weights to the instances from the\ncombined set based on their proximity to the target instance.

In this work, we explored\nhow to incorporate more visual information into the tokenizer and proposed a\nnew framework named Visual Gaussian Quantization (VGQ), a novel tokenizer\nparadigm that explicitly enhances structural modeling by integrating 2D\nGaussians into traditional visual codebook quantization frameworks.

We further demonstrate that increasing the\ndensity of 2D Gaussians within the tokens leads to significant gains in\nreconstruction fidelity, providing a flexible trade-off between token\nefficiency and visual richness.

The sophisticated\nanalysis of patient-generated health content, which contains complex emotional\nand medical contexts, requires scarce domain expertise, while traditional ML\napproaches are constrained by data shortage and privacy limitations in\nhealthcare settings. Online Health Communities (OHCs) exemplify these\nchallenges with mixed-sentiment posts, clinical terminology, and implicit\nemotional expressions that demand specialised knowledge for accurate Sentiment\nAnalysis (SA). To address these challenges, this study explores how Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) can integrate expert knowledge through in-context\nlearning for SA, providing a scalable solution for sophisticated health data\nanalysis. Specifically, we develop a structured codebook that systematically\nencodes expert interpretation guidelines, enabling LLMs to apply\ndomain-specific knowledge through targeted prompting rather than extensive\ntraining. Six GPT models validated alongside DeepSeek and LLaMA 3.1 are\ncompared with pre-trained language models (BioBERT variants) and lexicon-based\nmethods, using 400 expert-annotated posts from two OHCs. LLMs achieve superior\nperformance while demonstrating expert-level agreement. This high agreement,\nwith no statistically significant difference from inter-expert agreement\nlevels, suggests knowledge integration beyond surface-level pattern\nrecognition. The consistent performance across diverse LLM models, supported by\nin-context learning, offers a promising solution for digital health analytics.\nThis approach addresses the critical challenge of expert knowledge shortage in\ndigital health research, enabling real-time, expert-quality analysis for\npatient monitoring, intervention assessment, and evidence-based health\nstrategies."}

While mobile network servers have ample\ncomputational resources to support larger models than client devices, privacy\nconstraints prevent clients from directly sharing their raw data. Federated\nLearning (FL) enables decentralized clients to collaboratively train a shared\nmodel by exchanging model parameters instead of transmitting raw data.

To address these challenges, we propose\nFedOL, to construct a larger and more comprehensive server model in one-shot\nsettings (i.e., in a single communication round). Instead of model parameter\nsharing, FedOL employs knowledge distillation, where clients only exchange\nmodel prediction outputs on an unlabeled public dataset. This reduces\ncommunication overhead by transmitting compact predictions instead of full\nmodel weights and enables model customization by allowing heterogeneous model\narchitectures. A key challenge in this setting is that client predictions may\nbe biased due to skewed local data distributions, and the lack of ground-truth\nlabels in the public dataset further complicates reliable learning. To mitigate\nthese issues, FedOL introduces a specialized objective function that\niteratively refines pseudo-labels and the server model, improving learning\nreliability.

Previous work proposed a framework consisting of\nthree steps: the LLM first generates a summary and then a strategy for the\ndomain, both in natural language, and then implements that strategy as a Python\nprogram, that gets debugged on example planning tasks. In that work, only one\nstrategy is generated and passed directly to the program generation. If the\nstrategy is incorrect, its implementation will therefore result in an incorrect\ngeneralized plan. Here, we introduce an approach that generates the strategy in\nthe form of pseudocode and enables automatic debugging of the pseudocode, hence\nallowing us to identify and fix errors prior to the generation of the\ngeneralized plan itself. Additionally, we extend the Python debugging phase\nwith a reflection step prompting the LLM to pinpoint the reason for the\nobserved plan failure. Finally, we take inspiration from LLM code generation to\nproduce several program variants and pick the best one.

However, the nature of many\npractical decision-making problems favors a multimodal policy that facilitates\nrobust exploration of the environment and thus to address learning challenges\narising from sparse rewards, complex dynamics, or the need for strategic\nadaptation to varying contexts. This issue is exacerbated in continuous control\ndomains where exploration usually takes place in the vicinity of the predicted\noptimal action, either through an additive Gaussian noise or the sampling\nprocess of a stochastic policy. In this paper, we introduce Categorical\nPolicies to model multimodal behavior modes with an intermediate categorical\ndistribution, and then generate output action that is conditioned on the\nsampled mode. We explore two sampling schemes that ensure differentiable\ndiscrete latent structure while maintaining efficient gradient-based\noptimization. By utilizing a latent categorical distribution to select the\nbehavior mode, our approach naturally expresses multimodality while remaining\nfully differentiable via the sampling tricks. We evaluate our multimodal policy\non a set of DeepMind Control Suite environments, demonstrating that through\nbetter exploration, our learned policies converge faster and outperform\nstandard Gaussian policies.

At the output of the backbone, ViT-FIQA branches into two\nheads: (1) the patch tokens are passed through a fully connected layer to learn\ndiscriminative face representations via a margin-penalty softmax loss, and (2)\nthe quality token is fed into a regression head to learn to predict the face\nsample's utility. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks and several\nFR models, including both CNN- and ViT-based architectures, demonstrate that\nViT-FIQA consistently achieves top-tier performance. These results underscore\nthe effectiveness of transformer-based architectures in modeling face image\nutility and highlight the potential of ViTs as a scalable foundation for future\nFIQA research https://cutt.ly/irHlzXUC."}

Addressing timing violations at this early stage is essential, as\nmodern systems demand higher speeds, where even minor timing violations can\nlead to functional failures or system crashes. However, traditional timing\noptimization heavily relies on manual expertise, requiring engineers to\niteratively analyze timing reports and debug. To automate this process, this\npaper proposes ViTAD, a method that efficiently analyzes the root causes of\ntiming violations and dynamically generates targeted repair strategies.\nSpecifically, we first parse Verilog code and timing reports to construct a\nSignal Timing Dependency Graph (STDG). Based on the STDG, we perform violation\npath analysis and use large language models (LLMs) to infer the root causes of\nviolations. Finally, by analyzing the causes of violations, we selectively\nretrieve relevant debugging knowledge from a domain-specific knowledge base to\ngenerate customized repair solutions. To evaluate the effectiveness of our\nmethod, we construct a timing violation dataset based on real-world open-source\nprojects. This dataset contains 54 cases of violations.

These outputs serve as\nknowledge-enriched pseudo-annotations for supervised fine-tuning of a much\nsmaller student VLM. The resulting compact 3B-scale model, named VISTA (Vision\nfor Intelligent Scene and Traffic Analysis), is capable of understanding\nlow-resolution traffic videos and generating semantically faithful, risk-aware\ncaptions. Despite its significantly reduced parameter count, VISTA achieves\nstrong performance across established captioning metrics (BLEU-4, METEOR,\nROUGE-L, and CIDEr) when benchmarked against its teacher models. This\ndemonstrates that effective knowledge distillation and structured multi-agent\nsupervision can empower lightweight VLMs to capture complex reasoning\ncapabilities. The compact architecture of VISTA facilitates efficient\ndeployment on edge devices, enabling real-time risk monitoring without\nrequiring extensive infrastructure upgrades."}

Recent advances in generative\nmodeling have inspired new approaches to DA in high-dimensional nonlinear\nsettings, especially the ensemble score filter (EnSF).

In this paper, we\nintroduce a new filtering framework based on flow matching (FM) -- called the\nensemble flow filter (EnFF) -- to accelerate sampling and enable flexible\ndesign of probability paths. EnFF -- a training-free DA approach -- integrates\nMC estimators for the marginal FM vector field (VF) and a localized guidance to\nassimilate observations. EnFF has faster sampling and more flexibility in VF\ndesign compared to existing generative modeling for DA. Theoretically, we show\nthat EnFF encompasses classical filtering methods such as the bootstrap\nparticle filter and the ensemble Kalman filter as special cases.

Nowadays, financial decisions are shaped by external\npressures like obligatory consumption, algorithmic persuasion, and unstable\nwork schedules that erode financial autonomy. Obligatory consumption (like\nhidden fees) is intensified by digital ecosystems. Algorithmic tactics like\npersonalized recommendations lead to impulsive purchases. Unstable work\nschedules also undermine financial planning. Thus, it is important to study how\nthese factors impact consumption agency. To do so, we examine formal models\ngrounded in discounted consumption with constraints that bound agency. We\nconstruct analytical scenarios in which consumers face obligatory payments,\nalgorithm-influenced impulsive expenses, or unpredictable income due to\ntemporal instability. Using this framework, we demonstrate that even rational,\nutility-maximizing agents can experience early financial ruin when agency is\nlimited across structural, behavioral, or temporal dimensions and how\ndiminished autonomy impacts long-term financial well-being. Our central\nargument is that consumer agency must be treated as a value (not a given)\nrequiring active cultivation, especially in digital ecosystems. The connection\nbetween our formal modeling and this argument allows us to indicate that\nlimitations on agency (whether structural, behavioral, or temporal) can be\nrigorously linked to measurable risks like financial instability. This\nconnection is also a basis for normative claims about consumption as a value,\nby anchoring them in a formally grounded analysis of consumer behavior.

To handle viewpoint changes, we perform a detailed analysis and\nmanipulation of the 3D information in the video. Specifically, we utilize a\ndense stereo method to estimate a point cloud and the camera parameters of the\ninput video. We then propose a point cloud editing approach that uses depth\nmaps to represent the 3D geometry of newly edited components, aligning them\neffectively with the original 3D scene.

Based on this\ncomprehensive analysis, we identify key bottlenecks, spanning from the\nfoundational Physical Grounding Gap to systemic challenges in cross-modal\nintegration, dynamic adaptation, and open-world generalization. Finally, we\noutline a forward-looking research agenda encompassing physics-aware data\nmodels, adaptive storage-retrieval co-optimization, and standardized\nbenchmarking, to guide future research toward principled data management\nsolutions for EAI. Our survey is based on a comprehensive review of more than\n180 related studies, providing a rigorous roadmap for designing the robust,\nhigh-performance data management frameworks essential for the next generation\nof autonomous embodied systems."}

An example is collaborative\nlearning, which aims to train a global model based on data from individual\nagents. A major challenge in designing such systems is to guarantee safety and\nalignment with human values, particularly a fair distribution of rewards upon\nachieving the global goal. Cooperative game theory offers useful abstractions\nof cooperating agents via value functions, which assign value to each\ncoalition, and via reward functions. With these, the idea of fair allocation\ncan be formalized by specifying fairness axioms and designing concrete\nmechanisms. Classical cooperative game theory, exemplified by the Shapley\nvalue, does not fully capture scenarios like collaborative learning, as it\nassumes nonreplicable resources, whereas data and models can be replicated.\nInfinite replicability requires a generalized notion of fairness, formalized\nthrough new axioms and mechanisms. These must address imbalances in reciprocal\nbenefits among participants, which can lead to strategic exploitation and\nunfair allocations. The main contribution of this paper is a mechanism and a\nproof that it fulfills the property of mutual fairness, formalized by the\nBalanced Reciprocity Axiom. It ensures that, for every pair of players, each\nbenefits equally from the participation of the other."}

To evaluate MLLMs on these\nabilities, we introduce RotBench -- a 350-image manually-filtered benchmark\ncomprising lifestyle, portrait, and landscape images. Despite the relatively\nsimple nature of this task, we show that several state-of-the-art open and\nproprietary MLLMs, including GPT-5, o3, and Gemini-2.5-Pro, do not reliably\nidentify rotation in input images. Providing models with auxiliary information\n-- including captions, depth maps, and more -- or using chain-of-thought\nprompting offers only small and inconsistent improvements. Our results indicate\nthat most models are able to reliably identify right-side-up (0{\\deg}) images,\nwhile certain models are able to identify upside-down (180{\\deg}) images. None\ncan reliably distinguish between 90{\\deg} and 270{\\deg}. Simultaneously showing\nthe image rotated in different orientations leads to moderate performance gains\nfor reasoning models, while a modified setup using voting improves the\nperformance of weaker models. We further show that fine-tuning does not improve\nmodels' ability to distinguish 90{\\deg} and 270{\\deg} rotations, despite\nsubstantially improving the identification of 180{\\deg} images. Together, these\nresults reveal a significant gap between MLLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities\nand human perception in identifying rotation."}

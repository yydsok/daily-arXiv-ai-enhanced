To prune the search space, recent\nmethods prioritize searching on a simplified task only containing a few\n\"important\" entities predicted by a neural network. However, such a simple\nneuro-symbolic (NeSy) integration risks omitting critical entities and wasting\nresources on unsolvable simplified tasks. To enable Fast and reliable planning,\nwe introduce a NeSy relaxation strategy (Flax), combining neural importance\nprediction with symbolic expansion. Specifically, we first learn a graph neural\nnetwork to predict entity importance to create a simplified task and solve it\nwith a symbolic planner. Then, we solve a rule-relaxed task to obtain a quick\nrough plan, and reintegrate all referenced entities into the simplified task to\nrecover any overlooked but essential elements. Finally, we apply complementary\nrules to refine the updated task, keeping it both reliable and compact.\nExtensive experiments are conducted on both synthetic and real-world maze\nnavigation benchmarks where a robot must traverse through a maze and interact\nwith movable objects. The results show that Flax boosts the average success\nrate by 20.82% and cuts mean wall-clock planning time by 17.65% compared with\nthe state-of-the-art NeSy baseline.

As complex\nsystems grow, coherence becomes fragile unless a higher-order structure ensures\nsemantic consistency. This paper introduces the Recursive Coherence Principle\n(RCP): a foundational constraint stating that for any reasoning system of order\nN, composed of systems operating over conceptual spaces of order N-1, semantic\ncoherence is preserved only by a recursively evaluable generalization operator\nthat spans and aligns those lower-order conceptual spaces. Crucially, this\ncoherence enables structural alignment. Without recursive coherence, no system\ncan reliably preserve goals, meanings, or reasoning consistency at scale. We\nformally define the Functional Model of Intelligence (FMI) as the only known\noperator capable of satisfying the RCP at any scale. The FMI is a minimal,\ncomposable architecture with internal functions (evaluation, modeling,\nadaptation, stability, decomposition, bridging) and external functions\n(storage, recall, System 1 and System 2 reasoning) vital for preserving\nsemantic structure across inference and coordination layers. We prove that any\nsystem lacking the FMI will experience recursive coherence breakdown as it\nscales, arguing that common AI issues like misalignment, hallucination, and\ninstability are symptoms of this structural coherence loss.

This motivates a practical usage of genAI for knowledge management\nin engineering departments: using genAI for transcribing meetings and\nintegrating heterogeneous additional information sources into an easily usable\nformat for ad-hoc searches.\n  We implement an end-to-end pipeline to automate the entire meeting\ndocumentation workflow in a proof-of-concept state: meetings are recorded and\nminutes are created by genAI. These are further made easily searchable through\na chatbot interface. The core of our work is to test this genAI-based software\ntooling in a real-world engineering department and collect extensive survey\ndata on both ethical and technical aspects. Direct feedback from this\nreal-world setup points out both opportunities and risks: a) users agree that\nthe effort for meetings could be significantly reduced with the help of genAI\nmodels, b) technical aspects are largely solved already, c) organizational\naspects are crucial for a successful ethical usage of such a system."}

ACT's\nautomated pipeline significantly boosts the performance of these models,\nnarrowing the gap between open-source accessibility and the high performance of\nclosed-source solutions. Central to ACT is its synthetic data generation\nmodule, which builds extensive, high-quality datasets from initial code\nsamples, incorporating unit tests to ensure functional accuracy and diversity.\nACT's evaluation framework incorporates execution-level checks, offering a\ncomprehensive assessment of translation quality. A key feature in ACT is its\ncontroller module, which manages the entire pipeline by dynamically adjusting\nhyperparameters, orchestrating iterative data generation, and finetuning based\non real-time evaluations. This enables ACT to intelligently optimize when to\ncontinue training, generate additional targeted training data, or stop the\nprocess. Our results demonstrate that ACT consistently enhances the\neffectiveness of open-source models, offering businesses and developers a\nsecure and reliable alternative. Additionally, applying our data generation\npipeline to industry-scale migration projects has led to a notable increase in\ndeveloper acceleration."}

This enables\nsparse state updates via softmax-based top-$k$ hard classification, thereby\nextending receptive fields and reducing inter-class interference. Second, we\npresent Sparse State Expansion (SSE) within the sparse framework, which expands\nthe contextual state into multiple partitions, effectively decoupling parameter\nsize from state capacity while maintaining the sparse classification paradigm.\nOur design, supported by efficient parallelized implementations, yields\neffective classification and discriminative state representations. We\nextensively validate SSE in both pure linear and hybrid (SSE-H) architectures\nacross language modeling, in-context retrieval, and mathematical reasoning\nbenchmarks.

In previous work, we introduced a novel, brain-inspired architecture\nthat leverages a similar implementation to achieve a global 'routing by\nagreement' mechanism. Such a system modulates the network's activity by\nmatching each neuron's key with a single global query, pooled across the entire\nnetwork. Acting as a global attentional system, this mechanism improves noise\nrobustness over baseline levels but is insufficient for multi-classification\ntasks. Here, we improve on this work by proposing a novel mechanism that\ncombines aspects of the Transformer attentional operations with a compelling\nneuroscience theory, namely, binding by synchrony. This theory proposes that\nthe brain binds together features by synchronizing the temporal activity of\nneurons encoding those features. This allows the binding of features from the\nsame object while efficiently disentangling those from distinct objects. We\ndrew inspiration from this theory and incorporated angular phases into all\nlayers of a convolutional network. After achieving phase alignment via Kuramoto\ndynamics, we use this approach to enhance operations between neurons with\nsimilar phases and suppresses those with opposite phases. We test the benefits\nof this mechanism on two datasets: one composed of pairs of digits and one\ncomposed of a combination of an MNIST item superimposed on a CIFAR-10 image.\nOur results reveal better accuracy than CNN networks, proving more robust to\nnoise and with better generalization abilities.

Using 29,124 open text summaries of\ndeath investigations between 2013-2022, we conducted a thematic analysis to\nidentify 12 types of online activities that were considered by investigators or\nnext of kin to be relevant in contextualizing a given suicide death.

Today, almost all successful\napplications of RL for reasoning use binary reward functions that evaluate the\ncorrectness of LM outputs. Because such reward functions do not penalize\nguessing or low-confidence outputs, they often have the unintended side-effect\nof degrading calibration and increasing the rate at which LMs generate\nincorrect responses (or \"hallucinate\") in other problem domains. This paper\ndescribes RLCR (Reinforcement Learning with Calibration Rewards), an approach\nto training reasoning models that jointly improves accuracy and calibrated\nconfidence estimation. During RLCR, LMs generate both predictions and numerical\nconfidence estimates after reasoning. They are trained to optimize a reward\nfunction that augments a binary correctness score with a Brier score -- a\nscoring rule for confidence estimates that incentivizes calibrated prediction.\nWe first prove that this reward function (or any analogous reward function that\nuses a bounded, proper scoring rule) yields models whose predictions are both\naccurate and well-calibrated. We next show that across diverse datasets, RLCR\nsubstantially improves calibration with no loss in accuracy, on both in-domain\nand out-of-domain evaluations -- outperforming both ordinary RL training and\nclassifiers trained to assign post-hoc confidence scores. While ordinary RL\nhurts calibration, RLCR improves it.

Such assumptions are unrealistic in practice, and induce model\nmisspecification bias on any analysis performed after such imputation.\n  In this paper, we provide a principled alternative. Specifically, we develop\na new characterization for the full data law in graphical models of missing\ndata. This characterization is constructive, is easily adapted for the\ncalculation of imputation distributions for both MAR and MNAR (missing not at\nrandom) mechanisms, and is able to handle lack of support for certain patterns\nof missingness.

Applied to DCI experiments\nconducted on the SG-II Upgrade facility, the MULTI-Net model is able to predict\nthe implosion dynamics measured by the x-ray streak camera. It is found that an\neffective laser absorption factor about 65\\% is suitable for the\none-dimensional simulations of the DCI-R10 experiments. For shot 33, the mean\nimplosion velocity and collided plasma density reached 195 km/s and 117 g/cc,\nrespectively. This study demonstrates a data-driven AI framework that enhances\nthe prediction ability of simulations for complicated laser fusion experiments."}

Although recent\nself-improving models that iteratively refine themselves offer a feasible\nsolution, they still suffer from two core challenges: (i) most existing methods\naugment visual or textual data separately, resulting in discrepancies in data\ncomplexity (e.g., over-simplified diagrams paired with redundant textual\ndescriptions); and (ii) the evolution of data and models is also separated,\nleading to scenarios where models are exposed to tasks with mismatched\ndifficulty levels. To address these issues, we propose C2-Evo, an automatic,\nclosed-loop self-improving framework that jointly evolves both training data\nand model capabilities. Specifically, given a base dataset and a base model,\nC2-Evo enhances them by a cross-modal data evolution loop and a data-model\nevolution loop. The former loop expands the base dataset by generating complex\nmultimodal problems that combine structured textual sub-problems with\niteratively specified geometric diagrams, while the latter loop adaptively\nselects the generated problems based on the performance of the base model, to\nconduct supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning alternately.\nConsequently, our method continuously refines its model and training data, and\nconsistently obtains considerable performance gains across multiple\nmathematical reasoning benchmarks. Our code, models, and datasets will be\nreleased."}

Recent research\nproposes collaborative inference, which outsources the early-layer inference to\nensure data locality, and introduces model safety auditing based on inner\nneuron patterns. Both techniques expose the LLM's Internal States (ISs), which\nare traditionally considered irreversible to inputs due to optimization\nchallenges and the highly abstract representations in deep layers. In this\nwork, we challenge this assumption by proposing four inversion attacks that\nsignificantly improve the semantic similarity and token matching rate of\ninverted inputs. Specifically, we first develop two white-box\noptimization-based attacks tailored for low-depth and high-depth ISs. These\nattacks avoid local minima convergence, a limitation observed in prior work,\nthrough a two-phase inversion process. Then, we extend our optimization attack\nunder more practical black-box weight access by leveraging the transferability\nbetween the source and the derived LLMs. Additionally, we introduce a\ngeneration-based attack that treats inversion as a translation task, employing\nan inversion model to reconstruct inputs. Extensive evaluation of short and\nlong prompts from medical consulting and coding assistance datasets and 6 LLMs\nvalidates the effectiveness of our inversion attacks. Notably, a 4,112-token\nlong medical consulting prompt can be nearly perfectly inverted with 86.88 F1\ntoken matching from the middle layer of Llama-3 model. Finally, we evaluate\nfour practical defenses that we found cannot perfectly prevent ISs inversion\nand draw conclusions for future mitigation design."}

During RLCR, LMs generate both predictions and numerical\nconfidence estimates after reasoning. They are trained to optimize a reward\nfunction that augments a binary correctness score with a Brier score -- a\nscoring rule for confidence estimates that incentivizes calibrated prediction.\nWe first prove that this reward function (or any analogous reward function that\nuses a bounded, proper scoring rule) yields models whose predictions are both\naccurate and well-calibrated. We next show that across diverse datasets, RLCR\nsubstantially improves calibration with no loss in accuracy, on both in-domain\nand out-of-domain evaluations -- outperforming both ordinary RL training and\nclassifiers trained to assign post-hoc confidence scores. While ordinary RL\nhurts calibration, RLCR improves it. Finally, we demonstrate that verbalized\nconfidence can be leveraged at test time to improve accuracy and calibration\nvia confidence-weighted scaling methods. Our results show that explicitly\noptimizing for calibration can produce more generally reliable reasoning\nmodels."}

However,\ntraditional optimization methods often rely on manual tuning and heuristics,\nwhich can be time-consuming and error-prone. Recent studies proposed to\nleverage Large Language Models(LLMs) to assist in RTL code optimization. LLMs\ncan generate optimized code snippets based on natural language descriptions,\npotentially speeding up the optimization process. However, existing approaches\nhave not thoroughly evaluated the effectiveness of LLM-Based code optimization\nmethods for RTL code with complex timing logic. To address this gap, we\nconducted a comprehensive empirical investigation to assess the capability of\nLLM-Based RTL code optimization methods in handling RTL code with complex\ntiming logic. In this study, we first propose a new benchmark for RTL\noptimization evaluation. It comprises four subsets, each corresponding to a\nspecific area of RTL code optimization. Then we introduce a method based on\nmetamorphosis to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of LLM-Based RTL\ncode optimization methods.Our key insight is that the optimization\neffectiveness should remain consistent for semantically equivalent but more\ncomplex code. After intensive experiments, we revealed several key findings.\n(1) LLM-Based RTL optimization methods can effectively optimize logic\noperations and outperform existing compiler-based methods. (2) LLM-Based RTL\noptimization methods do not perform better than existing compiler-based methods\non RTL code with complex timing logic, particularly in timing control flow\noptimization and clock domain optimization. This is primarily attributed to the\nchallenges LLMs face in understanding timing logic in RTL code. Based on these\nfindings, we provide insights for further research in leveraging LLMs for RTL\ncode optimization."}

Existing approaches typically train VLA models in an\nend-to-end fashion, directly mapping inputs to actions without explicit\nreasoning, which hinders their ability to plan over multiple steps or adapt to\ncomplex task variations. In this paper, we propose ThinkAct, a dual-system\nframework that bridges high-level reasoning with low-level action execution via\nreinforced visual latent planning. ThinkAct trains a multimodal LLM to generate\nembodied reasoning plans guided by reinforcing action-aligned visual rewards\nbased on goal completion and trajectory consistency. These reasoning plans are\ncompressed into a visual plan latent that conditions a downstream action model\nfor robust action execution on target environments.

The paper\nexplores the pivotal role played by Anti-Money Laundering (AML) activities in\nthe global financial industry. It underscores the drawbacks of conventional AML\nsystems, which exhibit high rates of false positives and lack the\nsophistication to uncover intricate money laundering schemes. To tackle these\nchallenges, the paper proposes an advanced AML system that capitalizes on link\nanalysis using deep learning techniques. At the heart of this system lies the\nutilization of centrality algorithms like Degree Centrality, Closeness\nCentrality, Betweenness Centrality, and PageRank. These algorithms enhance the\nsystem's capability to identify suspicious activities by examining the\ninfluence and interconnections within networks of financial transactions. The\nsignificance of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) efforts within the global financial\nsector is discussed in this paper. It highlights the limitations of traditional\nAML systems. The results showed the practicality and superiority of the new\nimplementation of the GCN model, which is a preferable method for connectively\nstructured data, meaning that a transaction or account is analyzed in the\ncontext of its financial environment. In addition, the paper delves into the\nprospects of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) efforts, proposing the integration of\nemerging technologies such as deep learning and centrality algorithms. This\nintegration holds promise for enhancing the effectiveness of AML systems by\nrefining their capabilities."}

Existing evaluation approaches frequently suffer\nfrom high variance due to limited data and long-horizon tasks, or high bias due\nto unequal support or inaccurate environmental models. We posit that these\nchallenges arise, in part, from the standard reinforcement learning (RL)\nparadigm of policy learning without explicit consideration of evaluation. As an\nalternative, we propose evaluation-aware reinforcement learning (EvA-RL), in\nwhich a policy is trained to maximize expected return while simultaneously\nminimizing expected evaluation error under a given value prediction scheme --\nin other words, being \"easy\" to evaluate. We formalize a framework for EvA-RL\nand design an instantiation that enables accurate policy evaluation,\nconditioned on a small number of rollouts in an assessment environment that can\nbe different than the deployment environment. However, our theoretical analysis\nand empirical results show that there is often a tradeoff between evaluation\naccuracy and policy performance when using a fixed value-prediction scheme\nwithin EvA-RL. To mitigate this tradeoff, we extend our approach to co-learn an\nassessment-conditioned state-value predictor alongside the policy. Empirical\nresults across diverse discrete and continuous action domains demonstrate that\nEvA-RL can substantially reduce evaluation error while maintaining competitive\nreturns.

Classical control methods offer valuable insight into how such systems\ncan stabilize themselves, but synthesizing real-time controllers for nonlinear\nand hybrid dynamics remains challenging. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL)\nhas gained popularity for locomotion control due to its ability to handle these\ncomplex dynamics. In this work, we embed ideas from nonlinear control theory,\nspecifically control Lyapunov functions (CLFs), along with optimized dynamic\nreference trajectories into the reinforcement learning training process to\nshape the reward.

We assess our approach on five different datasets, with which\nwe simulate deployment conditions characterized by differing frequencies of\ndistributional shift.

As a result, they often fail to achieve optimal\nperformance by overlooking the crucial role of frequency-domain information in\nprompt learning. To address this issue, we propose an efficient Visual Fourier\nPrompt Tracking (named VFPTrack) method to learn modality-related prompts via\nFast Fourier Transform (FFT). Our method consists of symmetric feature\nextraction encoder with shared parameters, visual fourier prompts, and Modality\nFusion Prompt Generator that generates bidirectional interaction prompts\nthrough multi-modal feature fusion. Specifically, we first use a frozen feature\nextraction encoder to extract RGB and thermal infrared (TIR) modality features.\nThen, we combine the visual prompts in the spatial domain with the frequency\ndomain prompts obtained from the FFT, which allows for the full extraction and\nunderstanding of modality features from different domain information. Finally,\nunlike previous fusion methods, the modality fusion prompt generation module we\nuse combines features from different modalities to generate a fused modality\nprompt.

We applied\nequally-sized synthetic errors to manual MRI annotations from 50 participants\nto ensure sex-based comparability. Even minimal errors (e.g., a 1 mm boundary\nshift) produced systematic DSC differences between sexes. For small structures,\naverage DSC differences were around 0.03; for medium-sized structures around\n0.01. Only large structures (i.e., lungs and liver) were mostly unaffected,\nwith sex-based DSC differences close to zero.

The proposed approach not only maintains the\nintegrity of the original embeddings but also enhances the model's ability to\ngeneralize to more extended sequences. In causal language modeling, our ExPE\nembeddings significantly reduce perplexity compared to rotary and sinusoidal\nembeddings, when tested on sequences longer than those used in training."}

However, strong\naverage-case performance of machine learning (ML) models on these datasets is\ninsufficient to certify their clinical utility. In this paper, we use clinical\ncontext, as captured by prior discharge summaries, to provide a more holistic\nevaluation of current ``state-of-the-art'' models for the task of CXR\ndiagnosis. Using discharge summaries recorded prior to each CXR, we derive a\n``prior'' or ``pre-test'' probability of each CXR label, as a proxy for\nexisting contextual knowledge available to clinicians when interpreting CXRs.\nUsing this measure, we demonstrate two key findings: First, for several\ndiagnostic labels, CXR models tend to perform best on cases where the pre-test\nprobability is very low, and substantially worse on cases where the pre-test\nprobability is higher. Second, we use pre-test probability to assess whether\nstrong average-case performance reflects true diagnostic signal, rather than an\nability to infer the pre-test probability as a shortcut. We find that\nperformance drops sharply on a balanced test set where this shortcut does not\nexist, which may indicate that much of the apparent diagnostic power derives\nfrom inferring this clinical context.

The development of advanced control\nstrategies for complex scenarios is hindered, however, by the lack of\nscalability and robustness of the existing methods, in particular, due to the\nneed of an individual control for each agent. One possible solution involves\ncontrolling a system through a leader or a group of leaders, which other agents\ntend to follow. Using such an approach we develop an effective control strategy\nfor a leader, combining reinforcement learning (RL) with artificial forces\nacting on the system. To describe the guidance of active particles by a leader\nwe introduce the generalized Vicsek model. This novel method is then applied to\nthe problem of the effective evacuation by a robot-rescuer (leader) of large\ngroups of people from hazardous places.

Hangars typically feature tall ceilings and are often made of\nmaterials such as metal.

This\npersistent gap highlights the need for domain-specific comparative studies,\nincluding rigorous cost, accuracy, and integration assessments, to inform a\nreliable and scalable deployment of a localisation system in the Smart Hangar.\nThis paper presents the first techno-economic roadmap that benchmarks motion\ncapture (MoCap), ultra-wideband (UWB), and a ceiling-mounted camera network\nacross three operational scenarios: robot localisation, asset tracking, and\nsurface defect detection within a 40x50 m hangar bay. A dual-layer optimisation\nfor camera selection and positioning framework is introduced, which couples\nmarket-based camera-lens selection with an optimisation solver, producing\ncamera layouts that minimise hardware while meeting accuracy targets.

Pathology reports, as essential components of clinical workflows,\noffer readily available complementary information by summarizing\nhistopathological findings and integrating expert interpretations and clinical\ncontext. However, fusing these modalities poses challenges due to their\nheterogeneous nature. WSIs are high-dimensional, each containing several\nbillion pixels, whereas pathology reports consist of concise text summaries of\nvarying lengths, leading to potential modality imbalance. To address this, we\npropose a prototype-based approach to generate balanced representations, which\nare then integrated using a Transformer-based fusion model for survival\nprediction that we term PS3 (Predicting Survival from Three Modalities).\nSpecifically, we present: (1) Diagnostic prototypes from pathology reports,\nleveraging self-attention to extract diagnostically relevant sections and\nstandardize text representation; (2) Histological prototypes to compactly\nrepresent key morphological patterns in WSIs; and (3) Biological pathway\nprototypes to encode transcriptomic expressions, accurately capturing cellular\nfunctions.

To address these\nlimitations, we introduce Latent Iterative Refinement Flow (LIRF), a novel\napproach that reframes few-shot generation as the progressive densification of\ngeometrically structured manifold. LIRF establishes a stable latent space using\nan autoencoder trained with our novel \\textbf{manifold-preservation loss}\n$L_{\\text{manifold}}$. This loss ensures that the latent space maintains the\ngeometric and semantic correspondence of the input data. Building on this, we\npropose an iterative generate-correct-augment cycle.

However, LiDAR's high cost\ncontinues to restrict the broad adoption of high-level Autonomous Driving (AD)\nsystems in commercially available vehicles. Prior research has shown progress\ntowards circumventing the need for LiDAR by training a neural network, using\nLiDAR point clouds as ground truth (GT), to produce LiDAR-like 3D point clouds\nusing only 4D Radars. One of the best examples is a neural network created to\ntrain a more efficient radar target detector with a modular 2D convolutional\nneural network (CNN) backbone and a temporal coherence network at its core that\nuses the RaDelft dataset for training (see arXiv:2406.04723).

Building on this insight, we propose FedOC (Federated learning with\nOverlapping Clients), a novel framework designed to fully exploit the potential\nof these overlapping clients. In FedOC, overlapping clients could serve dual\nroles: (1) as Relay Overlapping Clients (ROCs), they forward edge models\nbetween neighboring ESs in real time to facilitate model sharing among\ndifferent ESs; and (2) as Normal Overlapping Clients (NOCs), they dynamically\nselect their initial model for local training based on the edge model delivery\ntime, which enables indirect data fusion among different regions of ESs.

Then each ES transmits the aggregated\nedge model to neighboring ESs through ROC relaying.

Since only a subset of the\nclients can participate in each FL training round, challenges arise pertinent\nto fairness in the client selection process. Over the years, a number of\nresearchers from both academia and industry have proposed numerous FL\nframeworks. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of them have employed\nfairness for FL-based client selection in a dynamic and heterogeneous IoV\nenvironment. Accordingly, in this paper, we envisage a FairEquityFL framework\nto ensure an equitable opportunity for all the clients to participate in the FL\ntraining process. In particular, we have introduced a sampling equalizer module\nwithin the selector component for ensuring fairness in terms of fair\ncollaboration opportunity for all the clients in the client selection process.\nThe selector is additionally responsible for both monitoring and controlling\nthe clients' participation in each FL training round. Moreover, an outlier\ndetection mechanism is enforced for identifying malicious clients based on the\nmodel performance in terms of considerable fluctuation in either accuracy or\nloss minimization. The selector flags suspicious clients and temporarily\nsuspend such clients from participating in the FL training process. We further\nevaluate the performance of FairEquityFL on a publicly available dataset,\nFEMNIST. Our simulation results depict that FairEquityFL outperforms baseline\nmodels to a considerable extent."}

We\nidentify a core latent instability issue by scaling the computational budget of\nimplicit CoT approaches: as we increase the number of implicit reasoning tokens\nto enhance performance, the training process often becomes unstable and\ncollapses. Our analysis reveals that this instability arises from the latent\nrepresentations becoming homogeneous and losing their semantic diversity, a\nfailure caused by insufficient step-level supervision in existing implicit CoT\napproaches. To address this issue, we propose SIM-CoT, a plug-and-play training\nmodule that introduces step-level supervision to stabilize and enrich the\nlatent reasoning space. Specifically, SIM-CoT employs an auxiliary decoder\nduring training to align each implicit token with its corresponding explicit\nreasoning step, ensuring that latent states capture distinct and meaningful\ninformation. The proposed auxiliary decoder is removed during inference,\npreserving the computational efficiency of implicit CoT methods with no added\noverhead. In addition, the auxiliary decoder affords interpretability of\nimplicit reasoning by projecting each latent token onto an explicit reasoning\nvocabulary, enabling per-step visualization of semantic roles and diagnosis.\nSIM-CoT significantly enhances both the in-domain accuracy and out-of-domain\nstability of various implicit CoT methods, boosting baselines like Coconut by\n+8.2% on GPT-2 and CODI by +3.0% on LLaMA-3.1 8B.

To address this gap, we\npropose a novel methodology for the verification, evaluation, and risk\nassessment of deep learning systems.

We combine these estimates with\nconditional probabilities of network correctness, structuring them in a binary\ntree. By traversing this tree, we can compute credible and precise estimates of\nnetwork accuracy. We assess our approach on five different datasets, with which\nwe simulate deployment conditions characterized by differing frequencies of\ndistributional shift. Our approach consistently outperforms conventional\nevaluation, with accuracy estimation errors typically ranging between 0.01 and\n0.1. We further showcase the potential of our approach on a medical\nsegmentation benchmark, wherein we apply our methods towards risk assessment by\nassociating costs with tree nodes, informing cost-benefit analyses and\nvalue-judgments.

In these unstable regions, even minimal parameter perturbations can\ndrastically alter the model's behaviors. Consequently, relearning attacks\nexploit this vulnerability by using just a few fine-tuning samples to navigate\nthe steep gradients surrounding these unstable regions, thereby rapidly\nrecovering knowledge that was supposedly erased.

Many public estimates are inconsistent and overstate\nenergy use, because they extrapolate from limited benchmarks and fail to\nreflect efficiency gains achievable at scale. In this perspective, we introduce\na bottom-up methodology to estimate the per-query energy of large-scale LLM\nsystems based on token throughput. For models running on an H100 node under\nrealistic workloads, GPU utilization and PUE constraints, we estimate a median\nenergy per query of 0.34 Wh (IQR: 0.18-0.67) for frontier-scale models (>200\nbillion parameters). These results are consistent with measurements using\nproduction-scale configurations and show that non-production estimates and\nassumptions can overstate energy use by 4-20x. Extending to test-time scaling\nscenarios with 15x more tokens per typical query, the median energy rises 13x\nto 4.32 Wh, indicating that targeting efficiency in this regime will deliver\nthe largest fleet-wide savings. We quantify achievable efficiency gains at the\nmodel, serving platform, and hardware levels, finding individual median\nreductions of 1.5-3.5x in energy per query, while combined advances can\nplausibly deliver 8-20x reductions. To illustrate the system-level impact, we\nestimate the baseline daily energy use of a deployment serving 1 billion\nqueries to be 0.8 GWh/day.

These approaches rely on evolutionary agentic harnesses\nthat leverage LLMs as mutation operators to generate candidate solutions.\nHowever, current code evolution methods suffer from critical limitations: they\nare sample inefficient, requiring thousands of samples to identify effective\nsolutions, and remain closed-source, hindering broad adoption and extension.\nShinkaEvolve addresses these limitations, introducing three key innovations: a\nparent sampling technique balancing exploration and exploitation, code novelty\nrejection-sampling for efficient search space exploration, and a bandit-based\nLLM ensemble selection strategy. We evaluate ShinkaEvolve across diverse tasks,\ndemonstrating consistent improvements in sample efficiency and solution\nquality. ShinkaEvolve discovers a new state-of-the-art circle packing solution\nusing only 150 samples, designs high-performing agentic harnesses for AIME\nmathematical reasoning tasks, identifies improvements to ALE-Bench competitive\nprogramming solutions, and discovers novel mixture-of-expert load balancing\nloss functions that illuminate the space of optimization strategies.

Their ability to generalize to\nproblems outside of this pre-training distribution remains largely unexplored.\nIn this work, we conduct a systematic empirical study to evaluate the\ngeneralization capabilities of pre-trained, transformer-based symbolic\nregression. We rigorously test performance both within the pre-training\ndistribution and on a series of out-of-distribution challenges for several\nstate of the art approaches. Our findings reveal a significant dichotomy: while\npre-trained models perform well in-distribution, the performance consistently\ndegrades in out-of-distribution scenarios. We conclude that this generalization\ngap is a critical barrier for practitioners, as it severely limits the\npractical use of pre-trained approaches for real-world applications."}

Building on this, we construct a\nlibrary of verified GMP references and deploy them online in a way that\nimitates the original GMP distribution whenever it is safe to do so, improving\nsafety without retraining. We evaluate across diverse planners, including\ndiffusion, flow matching, and vision-language models, improving safety in\nsimulation (on ground robots and quadcopters) and on hardware\n(differential-drive robot)."}

At each time step, a player decides the game\nin which they wish to participate in and the action they take in that game.\nTheir reward depends on the actions of all players that are in the same game.\nThis system of K games is termed `Meta Tug-of-War' (Meta-ToW) game.

We used 1,102 sample\nverbs, representing all verb morphological structures, to test and evaluate the\nsystem. The system achieves a performance of 97.4%, outperforming the baseline\nmodel and suggesting that future work should build a comprehensive system\nconsidering morphological variations of the language.\n  Keywords: Ge'ez, NLP, morphology, morphological synthesizer, rule-based"}

Models are available in HuggingFace (at\n  https://huggingface.co/collections/google/embeddinggemma-68b9ae3a72a82f0562a80dc4),\n  Kaggle (at https://www.kaggle.com/models/google/embeddinggemma/), and Vertex\n  AI (at\n  https://pantheon.corp.google.com/vertex-ai/publishers/google/model-garden/embeddinggemma)", "summary": "We introduce EmbeddingGemma, a new lightweight, open text embedding model\nbased on the Gemma 3 language model family. Our innovative training recipe\nstrategically captures knowledge from larger models via encoder-decoder\ninitialization and geometric embedding distillation. We improve model\nrobustness and expressiveness with a spread-out regularizer, and ensure\ngeneralizability by merging checkpoints from varied, optimized mixtures.\nEvaluated on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) across multilingual,\nEnglish, and code domains, EmbeddingGemma (300M) achieves state-of-the-art\nresults. Notably, it outperforms prior top models, both proprietary and open,\nwith fewer than 500M parameters, and provides performance comparable to models\ndouble its size, offering an exceptional performance-to-cost ratio. Remarkably,\nthis lead persists when quantizing model weights or truncating embedding\noutputs. This makes EmbeddingGemma particularly well-suited for low-latency and\nhigh-throughput use cases such as on-device applications. We provide ablation\nstudies exploring our key design choices. We release EmbeddingGemma to the\ncommunity to promote further research."}

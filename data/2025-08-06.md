### [1] [Efficient Agents: Building Effective Agents While Reducing Cost](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02694)
*Ningning Wang,Xavier Hu,Pai Liu,He Zhu,Yue Hou,Heyuan Huang,Shengyu Zhang,Jian Yang,Jiaheng Liu,Ge Zhang,Changwang Zhang,Jun Wang,Yuchen Eleanor Jiang,Wangchunshu Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLM）驱动代理的效率与性能权衡，提出了高效代理框架Efficient Agents，在保持性能的同时显著降低成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM代理系统复杂度的增加，其成本问题威胁到可扩展性和可访问性，需要在不牺牲性能的情况下设计更具成本效益的系统。

Method: 通过实证分析GAIA基准，评估LLM主干选择、代理框架设计和测试时扩展策略的影响，并使用成本-通过指标量化效率与性能的权衡。

Result: 提出的Efficient Agents框架在保持96.7%性能的同时，将运营成本从0.398美元降至0.228美元，成本-通过指标提升28.4%。

Conclusion: 该研究为设计高效、高性能的代理系统提供了实用见解，推动了AI驱动解决方案的可访问性和可持续性。

Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of Large Language Model (LLM)-driven agents have
enabled sophisticated systems to tackle complex, multi-step tasks, but their
escalating costs threaten scalability and accessibility. This work presents the
first systematic study of the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off in modern
agent systems, addressing the critical need for cost-effective designs without
sacrificing performance. We investigate three key questions: (1) How much
complexity do agentic tasks inherently require? (2) When do additional modules
yield diminishing returns? (3) How much efficiency can be gained through the
design of efficient agent frameworks? Through an empirical analysis on the GAIA
benchmark, we evaluate the impact of LLM backbone selection, agent framework
designs, and test-time scaling strategies. Using the cost-of-pass metric, we
quantify the efficiency-performance trade-off across these dimensions. Our
findings inform the development of Efficient Agents , a novel agent framework
that has an optimal complexity to task requirements. Efficient Agents retains
96.7% of the performance of OWL, one leading open-source agent framework, while
reducing operational costs from $0.398 to $0.228, resulting in a 28.4%
improvement in cost-of-pass. Our work provides actionable insights for
designing efficient, high-performing agent systems, advancing the accessibility
and sustainability of AI-driven solutions.

### [2] [Planning with Dynamically Changing Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02697)
*Mikhail Soutchanski,Yongmei Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无需领域闭包假设（DCA）的有界规划方法，适用于动态对象变化的规划问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统规划中对象集固定（DCA假设）的限制，适应动态对象变化的实际规划问题。

Method: 基于一阶逻辑建模规划问题，限制初始理论为有限的流文字集，并限制计划长度，提出基于动作序列的搜索方法。

Result: 证明了方法的完备性和正确性，适用于无DCA的有界规划问题。

Conclusion: 该方法为动态对象变化的规划问题提供了可行的解决方案，并通过概念验证实现展示了潜力。

Abstract: In classical planning and conformant planning, it is assumed that there are
finitely many named objects given in advance, and only they can participate in
actions and in fluents. This is the Domain Closure Assumption (DCA). However,
there are practical planning problems where the set of objects changes
dynamically as actions are performed; e.g., new objects can be created, old
objects can be destroyed. We formulate the planning problem in first-order
logic, assume an initial theory is a finite consistent set of fluent literals,
discuss when this guarantees that in every situation there are only finitely
many possible actions, impose a finite integer bound on the length of the plan,
and propose to organize search over sequences of actions that are grounded at
planning time. We show the soundness and completeness of our approach. It can
be used to solve the bounded planning problems without DCA that belong to the
intersection of sequential generalized planning (without sensing actions) and
conformant planning, restricted to the case without the disjunction over fluent
literals. We discuss a proof-of-the-concept implementation of our planner.

### [3] [Recovering Individual-Level Activity Sequences from Location-Based Service Data Using a Novel Transformer-Based Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02734)
*Weiyu Luo,Chenfeng Xiong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为VSNIT的新方法，用于恢复不完整的人类活动序列，结合了插入变换器和变量选择网络的优点，显著提升了活动序列恢复的准确性和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于基于位置服务（LBS）数据的稀疏性，导致活动序列不完整，难以准确推断人类移动行为。研究旨在利用高质量LBS数据恢复个体层面的不完整活动序列。

Method: 提出VSNIT方法，结合插入变换器的灵活序列构建能力和变量选择网络的动态协变量处理能力，以恢复缺失的活动序列片段。

Result: VSNIT能够插入更多样化、更真实的活动模式，更有效地恢复活动过渡，并在所有指标上显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: VSNIT在活动序列恢复任务中表现出更高的准确性和多样性，为未来基于位置的研究和应用提供了有前景的框架。

Abstract: Location-Based Service (LBS) data provides critical insights into human
mobility, yet its sparsity often yields incomplete trip and activity sequences,
making accurate inferences about trips and activities difficult. We raise a
research problem: Can we use activity sequences derived from high-quality LBS
data to recover incomplete activity sequences at the individual level? This
study proposes a new solution, the Variable Selection Network-fused Insertion
Transformer (VSNIT), integrating the Insertion Transformer's flexible sequence
construction with the Variable Selection Network's dynamic covariate handling
capability, to recover missing segments in incomplete activity sequences while
preserving existing data. The findings show that VSNIT inserts more diverse,
realistic activity patterns, more closely matching real-world variability, and
restores disrupted activity transitions more effectively aligning with the
target. It also performs significantly better than the baseline model across
all metrics. These results highlight VSNIT's superior accuracy and diversity in
activity sequence recovery tasks, demonstrating its potential to enhance LBS
data utility for mobility analysis. This approach offers a promising framework
for future location-based research and applications.

agents, including data preprocessing, model development, evaluation,
visualization, etc. Our work offers two key contributions: (1) a comprehensive
review of recent developments in applying LLMbased agents to data science
tasks; (2) a dual-perspective framework that connects general agent design
principles with the practical workflows in data science.

### [5] [Cognitive Loop via In-Situ Optimization: Self-Adaptive Reasoning for Science](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02789)
*Newman Cheng,Gordon Broadbent,William Chappell*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CLIO的新方法，通过动态优化实现AI的深度推理控制，显著提升了GPT-4.1在生物和医学问题上的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI框架在科学发现中缺乏透明性和可控性，科学家需要能够精确控制和观察推理过程的工具。

Method: 引入CLIO（认知循环动态优化），使大型语言模型能够自主调整问题解决策略，并通过开放设计让科学家介入修正。

Result: CLIO使GPT-4.1在HLE测试中的准确率提升了13.82%（相对提升161.64%），并揭示了内部不确定性波动对结果的关键影响。

Conclusion: CLIO的开放设计和内部机制为科学决策提供了新的洞察和控制手段。

Abstract: The capacity for artificial intelligence (AI) to formulate, evolve, and test
altered thought patterns under dynamic conditions indicates advanced cognition
that is crucial for scientific discovery. The existing AI development landscape
falls into two categories: 1) frameworks over non-reasoning models that
natively incorporate opinions on how humans think, and 2) reasoning models that
abstract precise control of the reasoning intuition away from end users. While
powerful, for scientists to maximize utility of AI in scientific discovery,
they not only require accuracy and transparency in reasoning, but also
steerability. Hence, we introduce an alternative approach that enables deep and
precise control over the reasoning process called: a cognitive loop via in-situ
optimization (CLIO). CLIO enables large language models (LLMs) to
self-formulate ways of approaching a problem, adapt behavior when
self-confidence is low, and ultimately provide scientists with a final belief
or answer. Through CLIO's open design, scientists can observe uncertainty
levels, understand how final belief states are formulated using graph
structures, and interject corrections. Without any further post-training,
OpenAI's GPT-4.1 with CLIO yields an accuracy of 22.37\% in text-based biology
and medicine questions on Humanity's Last Exam (HLE). This yields a 13.82\% net
or 161.64\% relative increase when compared to the base GPT-4.1 model and
surpasses OpenAI's o3 performance in high and low reasoning effort modes. We
further discovered that oscillations within internal uncertainty measures are
key in determining the accuracy of CLIO's results, revealing how its open
design and internal mechanisms can provide insight and control into scientific
decision-making processes.

### [6] [A Multi-Agent System for Complex Reasoning in Radiology Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02841)
*Ziruo Yi,Jinyu Liu,Ting Xiao,Mark V. Albert*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种多智能体系统（MAS）用于提升放射学视觉问答（RVQA）的准确性和可靠性，解决了现有方法在事实准确性、幻觉和跨模态对齐方面的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）和检索增强生成（RAG）的方法在RVQA中存在事实准确性不足、幻觉问题和跨模态对齐困难，因此需要一种更可靠的方法。

Method: 引入多智能体系统（MAS），包含专门用于上下文理解、多模态推理和答案验证的智能体，并通过模型分歧过滤筛选的挑战性RVQA数据集进行评估。

Result: 实验表明，该系统在多个MLLM基线模型上表现出优越性和有效性，案例研究展示了其可靠性和可解释性。

Conclusion: 多智能体方法为需要复杂推理的可解释和可信赖临床AI应用提供了潜力。

Abstract: Radiology visual question answering (RVQA) provides precise answers to
questions about chest X-ray images, alleviating radiologists' workload. While
recent methods based on multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have shown promising progress in RVQA,
they still face challenges in factual accuracy, hallucinations, and cross-modal
misalignment. We introduce a multi-agent system (MAS) designed to support
complex reasoning in RVQA, with specialized agents for context understanding,
multimodal reasoning, and answer validation. We evaluate our system on a
challenging RVQA set curated via model disagreement filtering, comprising
consistently hard cases across multiple MLLMs. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our system over strong MLLM
baselines, with a case study illustrating its reliability and interpretability.
This work highlights the potential of multi-agent approaches to support
explainable and trustworthy clinical AI applications that require complex
reasoning.

### [7] [Seemingly Simple Planning Problems are Computationally Challenging: The Countdown Game](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02900)
*Michael Katz,Harsha Kokel,Sarath Sreedharan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于游戏Countdown的规划基准生成方法，解决了现有基准在衡量模型规划能力上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有规划基准无法有效衡量基础模型和智能体的长期规划能力，要么任务定义模糊，要么依赖国际规划竞赛的领域和问题。

Method: 提出一种围绕Countdown游戏的规划基准生成方法，该问题具有自然语言描述、计算复杂度高（NP完全）和实例空间丰富等特点。

Result: 理论分析表明该基准具有计算复杂性，实例生成方法优于公共基准。实验显示现有LLM辅助规划方法在该动态基准上表现不佳。

Conclusion: Countdown基准为评估规划能力提供了更有效的工具，现有LLM方法在该问题上仍面临挑战。

Abstract: There is a broad consensus that the inability to form long-term plans is one
of the key limitations of current foundational models and agents. However, the
existing planning benchmarks remain woefully inadequate to truly measure their
planning capabilities. Most existing benchmarks either focus on loosely defined
tasks like travel planning or end up leveraging existing domains and problems
from international planning competitions. While the former tasks are hard to
formalize and verify, the latter were specifically designed to test and
challenge the weaknesses of existing automated planners. To address these
shortcomings, we propose a procedure for creating a planning benchmark centered
around the game called Countdown, where a player is expected to form a target
number from a list of input numbers through arithmetic operations. We discuss
how this problem meets many of the desiderata associated with an ideal
benchmark for planning capabilities evaluation. Specifically, the domain allows
for an intuitive, natural language description for each problem instance, it is
computationally challenging (NP-complete), and the instance space is rich
enough that we do not have to worry about memorization. We perform an extensive
theoretical analysis, establishing the computational complexity result and
demonstrate the advantage of our instance generation procedure over public
benchmarks. We evaluate a variety of existing LLM-assisted planning methods on
instances generated using our procedure. Our results show that, unlike other
domains like 24 Game (a special case of Countdown), our proposed dynamic
benchmark remains extremely challenging for existing LLM-based approaches.

### [8] [Enhancing Japanese Large Language Models with Reasoning Vectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02913)
*Carolina Minami Oguchi,Leo Wei,Koyo Kobayashi,Hsin-Tai Wu,Dipak Ghosal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 通过从推理LLMs中提取推理向量并应用于日语LLMs，提升其性能，解决了日语LLMs资源不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于资源限制，日语LLMs的性能提升困难，本文旨在通过简单有效的方法解决这一问题。

Method: 从推理LLMs中提取推理向量（任务权重的变化），并将其应用于日语LLMs。

Result: 显著提升了日语LLMs的性能，方法简单且有效。

Conclusion: 该方法为日语LLMs的性能提升提供了可行方案，并可能启发其他语言的类似研究。

Abstract: Post-training methods have improved the performance and enhanced the
reasoning capability for mainstream large language models (LLMs), but the same
is challenging for Japanese LLMs to achieve due to the amount of resources
required. Inspired by task vectors that extract the change of weights before
and after training, specifically for a certain task, we obtain reasoning
vectors from reasoning LLMs and apply them to Japanese LLMs to boost their
performance. While the resources available present a challenge to improve
Japanese LLMs, we present a simple and effective way to obtain high improvement
and hope to inspire for other languages.

### [9] [PentestJudge: Judging Agent Behavior Against Operational Requirements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02921)
*Shane Caldwell,Max Harley,Michael Kouremetis,Vincent Abruzzo,Will Pearce*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PentestJudge是一个基于大型语言模型（LLM）的系统，用于评估渗透测试代理的操作，通过分层任务分解和简单标准实现高效评分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种能够评估渗透测试代理操作的系统，以解决传统方法难以程序化评估的问题。

Method: 使用树状结构将渗透测试任务分解为更小的子任务和简单标准，利用LLM作为评分工具，并与人类专家评分对比。

Result: 最佳模型的F1分数达到0.83，工具使用能力强的模型更接近人类专家评分。

Conclusion: PentestJudge展示了LLM在评估渗透测试任务中的潜力，验证比生成更容易，为未来研究提供了方法论支持。

Abstract: We introduce PentestJudge, a system for evaluating the operations of
penetration testing agents. PentestJudge is a large language model
(LLM)-as-judge with access to tools that allow it to consume arbitrary
trajectories of agent states and tool call history to determine whether a
security agent's actions meet certain operating criteria that would be
impractical to evaluate programmatically. We develop rubrics that use a tree
structure to hierarchically collapse the penetration testing task for a
particular environment into smaller, simpler, and more manageable sub-tasks and
criteria until each leaf node represents simple yes-or-no criteria for
PentestJudge to evaluate. Task nodes are broken down into different categories
related to operational objectives, operational security, and tradecraft.
LLM-as-judge scores are compared to human domain experts as a ground-truth
reference, allowing us to compare their relative performance with standard
binary classification metrics, such as F1 scores. We evaluate several frontier
and open-source models acting as judge agents, with the best model reaching an
F1 score of 0.83. We find models that are better at tool-use perform more
closely to human experts. By stratifying the F1 scores by requirement type, we
find even models with similar overall scores struggle with different types of
questions, suggesting certain models may be better judges of particular
operating criteria. We find that weaker and cheaper models can judge the
trajectories of pentests performed by stronger and more expensive models,
suggesting verification may be easier than generation for the penetration
testing task. We share this methodology to facilitate future research in
understanding the ability of judges to holistically and scalably evaluate the
process quality of AI-based information security agents so that they may be
confidently used in sensitive production environments.

### [10] [AQUAH: Automatic Quantification and Unified Agent in Hydrology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02936)
*Songkun Yan,Zhi Li,Siyu Zhu,Yixin Wen,Mofan Zhang,Mengye Chen,Jie Cao,Yang Hong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AQUAH是一个基于语言的端到端水文建模代理，通过自然语言提示自动完成数据检索、模型配置、模拟运行和报告生成，初步实验显示其效果清晰透明。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在简化复杂的环境建模流程，降低地球观测数据、物理工具和决策者之间的门槛。

Method: 利用视觉支持的大型语言模型，自动解释地图和栅格数据，驱动水文建模工作流。

Result: 初步实验表明，AQUAH能够完成冷启动模拟并生成分析师就绪的文档，结果被专家认为清晰且物理合理。

Conclusion: 尽管仍需进一步校准和验证，AQUAH展示了基于LLM和视觉的代理在环境建模中的潜力。

Abstract: We introduce AQUAH, the first end-to-end language-based agent designed
specifically for hydrologic modeling. Starting from a simple natural-language
prompt (e.g., 'simulate floods for the Little Bighorn basin from 2020 to
2022'), AQUAH autonomously retrieves the required terrain, forcing, and gauge
data; configures a hydrologic model; runs the simulation; and generates a
self-contained PDF report. The workflow is driven by vision-enabled large
language models, which interpret maps and rasters on the fly and steer key
decisions such as outlet selection, parameter initialization, and uncertainty
commentary. Initial experiments across a range of U.S. basins show that AQUAH
can complete cold-start simulations and produce analyst-ready documentation
without manual intervention. The results are judged by hydrologists as clear,
transparent, and physically plausible. While further calibration and validation
are still needed for operational deployment, these early outcomes highlight the
promise of LLM-centered, vision-grounded agents to streamline complex
environmental modeling and lower the barrier between Earth observation data,
physics-based tools, and decision makers.

### [11] [MedBLINK: Probing Basic Perception in Multimodal Language Models for Medicine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02951)
*Mahtab Bigverdi,Wisdom Ikezogwo,Kevin Zhang,Hyewon Jeong,Mingyu Lu,Sungjae Cho,Linda Shapiro,Ranjay Krishna*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Medblink是一个用于评估多模态语言模型（MLMs）在医学图像感知任务中表现的基准测试，结果显示当前模型在简单感知任务上的表现远低于人类水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床医生对AI工具的采用非常谨慎，模型在简单感知任务上的错误会阻碍其临床应用，因此需要评估和改进模型的视觉基础能力。

Method: 研究团队开发了Medblink基准测试，包含8个临床相关任务，共1,429道多选题和1,605张图像，评估了19种先进的MLMs。

Result: 人类标注者的准确率为96.4%，而表现最佳的模型仅达到65%，表明当前MLMs在常规感知任务上表现不佳。

Conclusion: 当前MLMs的视觉基础能力不足，需进一步改进以支持临床应用。

Abstract: Multimodal language models (MLMs) show promise for clinical decision support
and diagnostic reasoning, raising the prospect of end-to-end automated medical
image interpretation. However, clinicians are highly selective in adopting AI
tools; a model that makes errors on seemingly simple perception tasks such as
determining image orientation or identifying whether a CT scan is
contrast-enhance are unlikely to be adopted for clinical tasks. We introduce
Medblink, a benchmark designed to probe these models for such perceptual
abilities. Medblink spans eight clinically meaningful tasks across multiple
imaging modalities and anatomical regions, totaling 1,429 multiple-choice
questions over 1,605 images. We evaluate 19 state-of-the-art MLMs, including
general purpose (GPT4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet) and domain specific (Med Flamingo,
LLaVA Med, RadFM) models. While human annotators achieve 96.4% accuracy, the
best-performing model reaches only 65%. These results show that current MLMs
frequently fail at routine perceptual checks, suggesting the need to strengthen
their visual grounding to support clinical adoption. Data is available on our
project page.

### [12] [Polymath: A Self-Optimizing Agent with Dynamic Hierarchical Workflow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02959)
*Chia-Tung Ho,Jing Gong,Xufeng Yao,Yunsheng Bai,Abhishek B Akkur,Haoxing Ren*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Polymath是一种自优化代理，通过动态分层工作流解决现实世界动态问题，无需标记数据，性能提升8.1%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于标记数据的方法在解决动态问题时效率低且不灵活，Polymath旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 结合任务流图的灵活性和代码表示的工作流，采用多网格图优化和自反思进化算法优化工作流。

Result: 在六个基准数据集上，Polymath平均性能提升8.1%。

Conclusion: Polymath为动态问题提供了一种高效、灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at solving complex tasks by executing
agentic workflows composed of detailed instructions and structured operations.
Yet, building general-purpose agents by manually embedding foundation models
into agentic systems such as Chain-of-Thought, Self-Reflection, and ReACT
through text interfaces limits scalability and efficiency. Recently, many
researchers have sought to automate the generation and optimization of these
workflows through code-based representations. However, existing methods often
rely on labeled datasets to train and optimize workflows, making them
ineffective and inflexible for solving real-world, dynamic problems where
labeled data is unavailable. To address this challenge, we introduce Polymath,
a self-optimizing agent with dynamic hierarchical workflow that leverages the
flexibility of task flow graphs and the expressiveness of code-represented
workflows to solve a wide range of real-world, dynamic problems. The proposed
optimization methodology integrates multi-grid-inspired graph optimization with
a self-reflection-guided evolutionary algorithm to refine workflows without
labeled data. Experimental results on six benchmark datasets across coding,
math, and multi-turn QA tasks show that Polymath achieves 8.1% average
improvement over state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型的自意识防御机制，利用LLM的推理能力自主防御提示注入攻击，显著提高了防御成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖外部分类器，而新方法利用LLM自身能力实现自主防御，更轻量且高效。

Method: 通过引入元认知和仲裁模块，使LLM能自主评估和调节输出。

Result: 在多个LLM和数据集上测试，防御成功率显著提升，部分模型在增强模式下接近完美防御。

Conclusion: 该方法为提升LLM伦理提供了一种轻量、高效的解决方案，适用于多平台GenAI应用。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel self-consciousness defense mechanism for Large
Language Models (LLMs) to combat prompt injection attacks. Unlike traditional
approaches that rely on external classifiers, our method leverages the LLM's
inherent reasoning capabilities to perform self-protection. We propose a
framework that incorporates Meta-Cognitive and Arbitration Modules, enabling
LLMs to evaluate and regulate their own outputs autonomously. Our approach is
evaluated on seven state-of-the-art LLMs using two datasets: AdvBench and
Prompt-Injection-Mixed-Techniques-2024. Experiment results demonstrate
significant improvements in defense success rates across models and datasets,
with some achieving perfect and near-perfect defense in Enhanced Mode. We also
analyze the trade-off between defense success rate improvement and
computational overhead. This self-consciousness method offers a lightweight,
cost-effective solution for enhancing LLM ethics, particularly beneficial for
GenAI use cases across various platforms.

### [14] [Unified Tool Integration for LLMs: A Protocol-Agnostic Approach to Function Calling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02979)
*Peng Ding,Rick Stevens*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一工具集成方法，通过协议无关设计减少开发成本，实验显示代码减少60-80%，性能提升3.1倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决工具增强型大语言模型生态碎片化问题，简化开发流程。

Method: 采用协议无关设计，自动生成模式，双模式并发执行和多源工具管理。

Result: 代码减少60-80%，性能提升3.1倍，兼容现有功能调用标准。

Conclusion: 提供了工具集成架构的理论见解和实际解决方案。

Abstract: The proliferation of tool-augmented Large Language Models (LLMs) has created
a fragmented ecosystem where developers must navigate multiple protocols,
manual schema definitions, and complex execution workflows. We address this
challenge by proposing a unified approach to tool integration that abstracts
protocol differences while optimizing execution performance. Our solution
demonstrates how protocol-agnostic design principles can significantly reduce
development overhead through automated schema generation, dual-mode concurrent
execution, and seamless multi-source tool management. Experimental results show
60-80% code reduction across integration scenarios, performance improvements up
to 3.1x through optimized concurrency, and full compatibility with existing
function calling standards. This work contributes both theoretical insights
into tool integration architecture and practical solutions for real-world LLM
application development.

Result: 研究发现代理评估在多个领域（如医学、法律、金融和教育）有实际应用潜力，但仍存在偏见、鲁棒性和元评估等挑战。

Conclusion: 代理评估可作为人类监督的补充，但无法完全替代，为下一代LLMs的可信、可扩展评估提供了方向。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) grow in capability and autonomy, evaluating
their outputs-especially in open-ended and complex tasks-has become a critical
bottleneck. A new paradigm is emerging: using AI agents as the evaluators
themselves. This "agent-as-a-judge" approach leverages the reasoning and
perspective-taking abilities of LLMs to assess the quality and safety of other
models, promising calable and nuanced alternatives to human evaluation. In this
review, we define the agent-as-a-judge concept, trace its evolution from
single-model judges to dynamic multi-agent debate frameworks, and critically
examine their strengths and shortcomings. We compare these approaches across
reliability, cost, and human alignment, and survey real-world deployments in
domains such as medicine, law, finance, and education. Finally, we highlight
pressing challenges-including bias, robustness, and meta evaluation-and outline
future research directions. By bringing together these strands, our review
demonstrates how agent-based judging can complement (but not replace) human
oversight, marking a step toward trustworthy, scalable evaluation for
next-generation LLMs.

TL;DR: BPO框架通过三阶段（引导、外推和优化）解决大型语言推理模型在多轮代理规划中的挑战，显著提升稀疏奖励环境下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在多轮交互环境中面临的信用分配问题和计算开销问题。

Method: 提出BPO框架，包括引导（规划四元组与长短链思维融合）、外推（复杂度分层课程学习）和优化（奖励门控拒绝采样）。

Result: 在ALFWorld、ScienceWorld和WebShop上实现最先进性能，且具有显著的标记效率。

Conclusion: BPO为代理规划中的推理模型提供了一种新方法，适用于长时程稀疏奖励环境。

Abstract: Large Language Reasoning Models have demonstrated remarkable success on
static tasks, yet their application to multi-round agentic planning in
interactive environments faces two fundamental challenges. First, the
intractable credit assignment problem renders conventional reinforcement
learning ineffective in sparse-reward settings. Second, the computational
overhead of verbose, step-by-step reasoning histories is prohibitive. To
address these challenges, we propose BPO, a three-stage framework
(bootstrapping, extrapolation, and refinement) that establishes a
self-improving data flywheel to develop robust reasoning models for
long-horizon, sparse-reward environments. Our framework first bootstraps
efficient reasoning using the proposed planning quaternions with long-short
chain-of-thought fusion. It then extrapolates to out-of-distribution tasks
through complexity-stratified curriculum learning. Finally, the model
iteratively refines itself by learning exclusively on experiences selected via
reward-gated rejection sampling. Experiments on ALFWorld, ScienceWorld, and
WebShop demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art with
significant token efficiency, providing a new recipe for reasoning models in
agentic planning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多智能体的协作学习框架（Collab-Solver），通过Stackelberg博弈优化MILP求解器中多个模块的策略，显著提升了求解性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于学习的MILP方法独立处理各模块策略学习，忽视了模块间的相互依赖，影响了求解速度和质量。

Method: 将MILP求解中的割平面选择和分支协作建模为Stackelberg博弈，采用两阶段学习范式（预训练和协同优化）稳定策略学习。

Result: 在合成和大规模真实MILP数据集上，联合学习的策略显著提升了求解性能，并展现了优秀的跨实例集泛化能力。

Conclusion: Collab-Solver通过协作优化策略，解决了模块间相互依赖问题，为MILP求解提供了高效且泛化性强的解决方案。

Abstract: Mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) has been a fundamental problem in
combinatorial optimization. Previous works have designed a plethora of
hard-coded heuristics to accomplish challenging MILP solving with domain
knowledge. Driven by the high capability of neural networks, recent research is
devoted to replacing manually designed heuristics with learned policies.
Although learning-based MILP methods have shown great promise, existing
worksindependentlytreatthepolicylearningineachmoduleofMILPsolvers without
considering their interdependence, severely hurting the solving speed and
quality. To address this issue, we propose a novel multi-agent-based policy
learning framework for MILP (Collab-Solver), which can collaboratively optimize
the policies for multiple modules. Specifically, we formulate the collaboration
of cut selection and branching in MILP solving as a Stackelberg game. Under
this formulation, we develop a two-phase learning paradigm to stabilize the
collaborative policy learning, where the first phase achieves the
data-communicated policy pretraining and the second phase further orchestrates
the policy learning for various modules. The jointly learned policy
significantly improves the solving performance on both synthetic and
large-scale real-world MILP datasets. Moreover, the policies learned by
Collab-Solver have also demonstrated excellent generalization abilities across
different instance sets.

Method: 将ODE问题及其解转化为序列提示，评估GPT-2在两类ODE任务上的表现。

Result: GPT-2表现出与欧拉方法相当或更好的收敛性，且随着示例增加，精度呈指数提升，还能泛化到分布外问题。

Conclusion: 研究为ICL机制提供了新见解，展示了其在解决非线性数值问题中的潜力。

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) has emerged as a new paradigm in large language
models (LLMs), enabling them to perform novel tasks by conditioning on a few
examples embedded in the prompt. Yet, the highly nonlinear behavior of ICL for
NLP tasks remains poorly understood. To shed light on its underlying
mechanisms, this paper investigates whether LLMs can solve ordinary
differential equations (ODEs) under the ICL setting. We formulate standard ODE
problems and their solutions as sequential prompts and evaluate GPT-2 models on
these tasks. Experiments on two types of ODEs show that GPT-2 can effectively
learn a meta-ODE algorithm, with convergence behavior comparable to, or better
than, the Euler method, and achieve exponential accuracy gains with increasing
numbers of demonstrations. Moreover, the model generalizes to
out-of-distribution (OOD) problems, demonstrating robust extrapolation
capabilities. These empirical findings provide new insights into the mechanisms
of ICL in NLP and its potential for solving nonlinear numerical problems.

Motivation: 现有大型语言模型在复杂医学诊断任务中因推理深度不足导致信息丢失或逻辑跳跃，诊断效果不佳。

Method: 提出ToR框架，采用树状结构记录推理路径和临床证据，并引入多智能体验证机制确保决策一致性。

Result: 在真实医学数据上实验表明，ToR框架优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: ToR框架通过改进推理路径和验证机制，显著提升了医学诊断任务的性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in the medical
domain. However, existing models still fall short when faced with complex
medical diagnosis task in the real world. This is mainly because they lack
sufficient reasoning depth, which leads to information loss or logical jumps
when processing a large amount of specialized medical data, leading to
diagnostic errors. To address these challenges, we propose Tree-of-Reasoning
(ToR), a novel multi-agent framework designed to handle complex scenarios.
Specifically, ToR introduces a tree structure that can clearly record the
reasoning path of LLMs and the corresponding clinical evidence. At the same
time, we propose a cross-validation mechanism to ensure the consistency of
multi-agent decision-making, thereby improving the clinical reasoning ability
of multi-agents in complex medical scenarios. Experimental results on
real-world medical data show that our framework can achieve better performance
than existing baseline methods.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于认知驱动的防御框架（CDD），通过模拟人类认知推理和强化学习，有效防御LLMs的越狱攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法依赖浅层模式匹配，难以应对新型攻击策略。

Method: CDD框架结合全局感知和局部分析，通过监督微调和熵引导强化学习（EG-GRPO）识别和探索攻击模式。

Result: 实验显示CDD在防御性能和泛化能力上达到最优。

Conclusion: CDD为LLMs的安全部署提供了高效且通用的防御方案。

Abstract: Defending large language models (LLMs) against jailbreak attacks is essential
for their safe and reliable deployment. Existing defenses often rely on shallow
pattern matching, which struggles to generalize to novel and unseen attack
strategies. To address this challenge, we propose the Cognitive-Driven Defense
(CDD) framework, which targets the underlying structure of jailbreak prompts by
applying meta-operations, defined as basic manipulations that conceal harmful
intent.CDD emulates human cognitive reasoning through a structured reasoning
chain. It begins with a global perception of the prompt and follows with a
localized analysis to uncover hidden manipulations. By applying supervised
fine-tuning on this structured chain, the model learns to identify and reason
about known manipulation patterns. To enhance generalization to unseen threats,
an entropy-guided reinforcement learning algorithm (EG-GRPO) is introduced to
encourage exploration of new types and variants of meta-operations. Experiments
demonstrate that CDD can achieve state-of-the-art defense performance and
exhibit strong generalization to unseen jailbreak attacks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文评估开源与专有大语言模型在法律风险分析中的表现，发现专有模型总体更优，开源模型需针对性优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索开源大语言模型在法律领域的潜力，解决数据保密需求下的本地部署问题。

Method: 使用ContractEval基准和CUAD数据集，评估4个专有和15个开源模型。

Result: 专有模型表现更优，开源模型需改进；推理模式影响输出效果；量化加速但降低性能。

Conclusion: 开源模型需针对性优化，ContractEval为法律领域LLM发展提供基准。

Abstract: The potential of large language models (LLMs) in specialized domains such as
legal risk analysis remains underexplored. In response to growing interest in
locally deploying open-source LLMs for legal tasks while preserving data
confidentiality, this paper introduces ContractEval, the first benchmark to
thoroughly evaluate whether open-source LLMs could match proprietary LLMs in
identifying clause-level legal risks in commercial contracts. Using the
Contract Understanding Atticus Dataset (CUAD), we assess 4 proprietary and 15
open-source LLMs. Our results highlight five key findings: (1) Proprietary
models outperform open-source models in both correctness and output
effectiveness, though some open-source models are competitive in certain
specific dimensions. (2) Larger open-source models generally perform better,
though the improvement slows down as models get bigger. (3) Reasoning
("thinking") mode improves output effectiveness but reduces correctness, likely
due to over-complicating simpler tasks. (4) Open-source models generate "no
related clause" responses more frequently even when relevant clauses are
present. This suggests "laziness" in thinking or low confidence in extracting
relevant content. (5) Model quantization speeds up inference but at the cost of
performance drop, showing the tradeoff between efficiency and accuracy. These
findings suggest that while most LLMs perform at a level comparable to junior
legal assistants, open-source models require targeted fine-tuning to ensure
correctness and effectiveness in high-stakes legal settings. ContractEval
offers a solid benchmark to guide future development of legal-domain LLMs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）的自动化启发式集合设计（AHSD）方法，通过生成互补的启发式集合来提升泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅设计单一启发式，泛化能力不足，无法适应不同问题实例的分布或设置。

Method: 提出AHSD框架，目标函数具有单调性和超模性；设计EoH-S算法，结合互补种群管理和互补感知的模因搜索。

Result: 在三个AHD任务中，EoH-S显著优于现有方法，性能提升高达60%。

Conclusion: AHSD和EoH-S有效解决了单一启发式的泛化问题，为自动化启发式设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Automated Heuristic Design (AHD) using Large Language Models (LLMs) has
achieved notable success in recent years. Despite the effectiveness of existing
approaches, they only design a single heuristic to serve all problem instances,
often inducing poor generalization across different distributions or settings.
To address this issue, we propose Automated Heuristic Set Design (AHSD), a new
formulation for LLM-driven AHD. The aim of AHSD is to automatically generate a
small-sized complementary heuristic set to serve diverse problem instances,
such that each problem instance could be optimized by at least one heuristic in
this set. We show that the objective function of AHSD is monotone and
supermodular. Then, we propose Evolution of Heuristic Set (EoH-S) to apply the
AHSD formulation for LLM-driven AHD. With two novel mechanisms of complementary
population management and complementary-aware memetic search, EoH-S could
effectively generate a set of high-quality and complementary heuristics.
Comprehensive experimental results on three AHD tasks with diverse instances
spanning various sizes and distributions demonstrate that EoH-S consistently
outperforms existing state-of-the-art AHD methods and achieves up to 60\%
performance improvements.

Result: MissDDIM减少了推理延迟并稳定了输出，适用于实际场景。

Conclusion: MissDDIM通过改进扩散模型，为表格数据填补提供了更高效和稳定的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently emerged as powerful tools for missing data
imputation by modeling the joint distribution of observed and unobserved
variables. However, existing methods, typically based on stochastic denoising
diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs), suffer from high inference latency and
variable outputs, limiting their applicability in real-world tabular settings.
To address these deficiencies, we present in this paper MissDDIM, a conditional
diffusion framework that adapts Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) for
tabular imputation. While stochastic sampling enables diverse completions, it
also introduces output variability that complicates downstream processing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法生成不可学习示例需要暴露原始数据给第三方服务，导致隐私矛盾。T2UE旨在通过文本描述实现零接触数据保护。

Method: 利用文本到图像模型将文本描述映射到噪声空间，结合误差最小化框架生成有效噪声。

Result: T2UE保护的数据显著降低了下游任务性能，且保护效果泛化至多种架构和监督学习场景。

Conclusion: T2UE实现了仅基于文本描述的数据保护，无需直接暴露数据，为隐私保护提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large-scale pre-training frameworks like CLIP have revolutionized multimodal
learning, but their reliance on web-scraped datasets, frequently containing
private user data, raises serious concerns about misuse. Unlearnable Examples
(UEs) have emerged as a promising countermeasure against unauthorized model
training, employing carefully crafted unlearnable noise to disrupt the learning
of meaningful representations from protected data. Current approaches typically
generate UEs by jointly optimizing unlearnable noise for both images and their
associated text descriptions (or labels). However, this optimization process is
often computationally prohibitive for on-device execution, forcing reliance on
external third-party services. This creates a fundamental privacy paradox:
users must initially expose their data to these very services to achieve
protection, thereby compromising privacy in the process. Such a contradiction
has severely hindered the development of practical, scalable data protection
solutions. To resolve this paradox, we introduce \textbf{Text-to-Unlearnable
Example (T2UE)}, a novel framework that enables users to generate UEs using
only text descriptions. T2UE circumvents the need for original image data by
employing a text-to-image (T2I) model to map text descriptions into the image
(noise) space, combined with an error-minimization framework to produce
effective unlearnable noise. Extensive experiments show that T2UE-protected
data substantially degrades performance in downstream tasks (e.g., cross-modal
retrieval) for state-of-the-art models. Notably, the protective effect
generalizes across diverse architectures and even to supervised learning
settings. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of "zero-contact data
protection", where personal data can be safeguarded based solely on their
textual descriptions, eliminating the need for direct data exposure.

Abstract: With the proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs), the detection of
misinformation has become increasingly important and complex. This research
proposes an innovative verifiable misinformation detection LLM agent that goes
beyond traditional true/false binary judgments. The agent actively verifies
claims through dynamic interaction with diverse web sources, assesses
information source credibility, synthesizes evidence, and provides a complete
verifiable reasoning process. Our designed agent architecture includes three
core tools: precise web search tool, source credibility assessment tool and
numerical claim verification tool. These tools enable the agent to execute
multi-step verification strategies, maintain evidence logs, and form
comprehensive assessment conclusions. We evaluate using standard misinformation
datasets such as FakeNewsNet, comparing with traditional machine learning
models and LLMs. Evaluation metrics include standard classification metrics,
quality assessment of reasoning processes, and robustness testing against
rewritten content. Experimental results show that our agent outperforms
baseline methods in misinformation detection accuracy, reasoning transparency,
and resistance to information rewriting, providing a new paradigm for
trustworthy AI-assisted fact-checking.

Motivation: 智能教育中生成代理模型的开发不足，且教育场景复杂，需个性化人机交互。

Method: 提出AgentSME框架，采用三种通信模式（Solo、Mono、Echo），以准确性为主指标，辅以多样性评估。

Result: Echo模式准确性最高，DeepSeek模型多样性最佳。

Conclusion: 研究为提升智能教育代理学习能力提供了有价值的信息。

Abstract: Generative agent models specifically tailored for smart education are
critical, yet remain relatively underdeveloped. A key challenge stems from the
inherent complexity of educational contexts: learners are human beings with
various cognitive behaviors, and pedagogy is fundamentally centered on
personalized human-to-human communication. To address this issue, this paper
proposes AgentSME, a unified generative agent framework powered by LLM. Three
directional communication modes are considered in the models, namely Solo,
Mono, and Echo, reflecting different types of agency autonomy and communicative
reciprocity. Accuracy is adopted as the primary evaluation metric, complemented
by three diversity indices designed to assess the diversity of reasoning
contents. Six widely used LLMs are tested to validate the robustness of
communication modes across different model tiers, which are equally divided
into base-capacity and high-capacity configurations. The results show that
generative agents that employ the Echo communication mode achieve the highest
accuracy scores, while DeepSeek exhibits the greatest diversity. This study
provides valuable information to improve agent learning capabilities and
inspire smart education models.

Abstract: We present a framework for training trustworthy large language model (LLM)
agents for optimization modeling via a verifiable synthetic data generation
pipeline. Focusing on linear and mixed-integer linear programming, our approach
begins with structured symbolic representations and systematically produces
natural language descriptions, mathematical formulations, and solver-executable
code. By programmatically constructing each instance with known optimal
solutions, the pipeline ensures full verifiability and enables automatic
filtering of low-quality demonstrations generated by teacher models. Each
dataset instance includes a structured representation of the optimization
problem, a corresponding natural language description, the verified optimal
solution, and step-by-step demonstrations - generated by a teacher model - that
show how to model and solve the problem across multiple optimization modeling
languages. This enables supervised fine-tuning of open-source LLMs specifically
tailored to optimization tasks. To operationalize this pipeline, we introduce
OptiTrust, a modular LLM agent that performs multi-stage translation from
natural language to solver-ready code, leveraging stepwise demonstrations,
multi-language inference, and majority-vote cross-validation. Our agent
achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks. Out of 7
datasets, it achieves the highest accuracy on six and outperforms the next-best
algorithm by at least 8 percentage on three of them. Our approach provides a
scalable, verifiable, and principled path toward building reliable LLM agents
for real-world optimization applications.

Abstract: This research investigates the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI)

questions, to evaluate the environmental knowledge of university students in
comparison to the responses generated by the AI models. The results of this
study suggest that while AI models possess a vast, readily accessible, and
valid knowledge base with the potential to empower both students and academic
staff, a human discipline specialist in environmental sciences may still be
necessary to validate the accuracy of the information provided.

into a symbolic estimand that can be non-parametrically estimated from the
available data. $Y_0$ provides a domain-specific language for representing
causal queries and estimands as symbolic probabilistic expressions, tools for
representing causal graphical models with unobserved confounders, such as
acyclic directed mixed graphs (ADMGs), and implementations of numerous

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态大语言模型在形式几何推理方面表现不佳，特别是动态构建和验证辅助几何元素时。

Method: Geoint-R1整合了辅助元素构建、通过Lean4表示的形式推理和交互式可视化。

Result: 在包含1,885个几何问题的基准测试中，Geoint-R1显著优于现有模型，尤其是在需要显式辅助元素构建的难题上。

Conclusion: Geoint-R1为形式几何推理提供了有效的解决方案，并通过基准测试验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Mathematical geometric reasoning is essential for scientific discovery and
educational development, requiring precise logic and rigorous formal
verification. While recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
have improved reasoning tasks, existing models typically struggle with formal
geometric reasoning, particularly when dynamically constructing and verifying
auxiliary geometric elements. To address these challenges, we introduce
Geoint-R1, a multimodal reasoning framework designed to generate formally
verifiable geometric solutions from textual descriptions and visual diagrams.
Geoint-R1 uniquely integrates auxiliary elements construction, formal reasoning
represented via Lean4, and interactive visualization. To systematically
evaluate and advance formal geometric reasoning, we propose the Geoint
benchmark, comprising 1,885 rigorously annotated geometry problems across
diverse topics such as plane, spatial, and solid geometry. Each problem
includes structured textual annotations, precise Lean4 code for auxiliary
constructions, and detailed solution steps verified by experts. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Geoint-R1 significantly surpasses existing
multimodal and math-specific reasoning models, particularly on challenging
problems requiring explicit auxiliary element constructions.

Abstract: Collaborative partnership matters in inquiry-oriented education. However,
most study partners are selected either rely on experience-based assignments
with little scientific planning or build on rule-based machine assistants,
encountering difficulties in knowledge expansion and inadequate flexibility.
This paper proposes an LLM-empowered agent model for simulating and selecting
learning partners tailored to inquiry-oriented learning, named InqEduAgent.
Generative agents are designed to capture cognitive and evaluative features of
learners in real-world scenarios. Then, an adaptive matching algorithm with
Gaussian process augmentation is formulated to identify patterns within prior
knowledge. Optimal learning-partner matches are provided for learners facing
different exercises. The experimental results show the optimal performance of
InqEduAgent in most knowledge-learning scenarios and LLM environment with
different levels of capabilities. This study promotes the intelligent
allocation of human-based learning partners and the formulation of AI-based

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种全历史图模型和ETDNet网络，用于建模实体间动态交互，显著提升了驾驶意图预测和比特币欺诈检测的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实任务中需要建模实体间的动态交互（如交通中的车辆行为或金融交易网络），现有方法通常使用快照图，无法明确表示关系和其演化。

Method: 提出全历史图模型，包含节点（每个时间步的实体）和两类边（时间步内边和时间步间边），并设计ETDNet网络，结合图注意力和时间注意力模块。

Result: 在Waymo和Elliptic++数据集上，ETDNet显著优于基线，驾驶意图预测准确率提升至75.6%，欺诈检测F1分数提升至88.1%。

Conclusion: 通过将结构和时间关系表示为图中的不同边，ETDNet有效提升了动态交互建模的性能。

Abstract: Modeling evolving interactions among entities is critical in many real-world
tasks. For example, predicting driver maneuvers in traffic requires tracking
how neighboring vehicles accelerate, brake, and change lanes relative to one
another over consecutive frames. Likewise, detecting financial fraud hinges on
following the flow of funds through successive transactions as they propagate
through the network. Unlike classic time-series forecasting, these settings
demand reasoning over who interacts with whom and when, calling for a
temporal-graph representation that makes both the relations and their evolution
explicit. Existing temporal-graph methods typically use snapshot graphs to
encode temporal evolution. We introduce a full-history graph that instantiates
one node for every entity at every time step and separates two edge sets: (i)
intra-time-step edges that capture relations within a single frame and (ii)
inter-time-step edges that connect an entity to itself at consecutive steps. To
learn on this graph we design an Edge-Type Decoupled Network (ETDNet) with
parallel modules: a graph-attention module aggregates information along
intra-time-step edges, a multi-head temporal-attention module attends over an
entity's inter-time-step history, and a fusion module combines the two messages
after every layer. Evaluated on driver-intention prediction (Waymo) and Bitcoin
fraud detection (Elliptic++), ETDNet consistently surpasses strong baselines,
lifting Waymo joint accuracy to 75.6\% (vs. 74.1\%) and raising Elliptic++
illicit-class F1 to 88.1\% (vs. 60.4\%). These gains demonstrate the benefit of
representing structural and temporal relations as distinct edges in a single
graph.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具增强的视觉问答（VQA）在真实世界工具使用中存在显著不足，特别是在功能多样化的多模态环境中。

Method: 提出ToolVQA数据集和ToolEngine数据生成管道，采用深度优先搜索（DFS）和动态上下文示例匹配机制模拟人类工具使用推理。

Result: 在ToolVQA上微调的7B大型基础模型在测试集上表现优异，并在多个OOD数据集上超越GPT-3.5-turbo。

Conclusion: ToolVQA和ToolEngine显著提升了模型在真实世界工具使用中的泛化能力和多步推理能力。

Abstract: Integrating external tools into Large Foundation Models (LFMs) has emerged as
a promising approach to enhance their problem-solving capabilities. While
existing studies have demonstrated strong performance in tool-augmented Visual
Question Answering (VQA), recent benchmarks reveal significant gaps in
real-world tool-use proficiency, particularly in functionally diverse
multimodal settings requiring multi-step reasoning. In this work, we introduce
ToolVQA, a large-scale multimodal dataset comprising 23K instances, designed to
bridge this gap. Unlike previous datasets that rely on synthetic scenarios and
simplified queries, ToolVQA features real-world visual contexts and challenging
implicit multi-step reasoning tasks, better aligning with real user
interactions. To construct this dataset, we propose ToolEngine, a novel data
generation pipeline that employs Depth-First Search (DFS) with a dynamic
in-context example matching mechanism to simulate human-like tool-use
reasoning. ToolVQA encompasses 10 multimodal tools across 7 diverse task
domains, with an average inference length of 2.78 reasoning steps per instance.
The fine-tuned 7B LFMs on ToolVQA not only achieve impressive performance on
our test set but also surpass the large close-sourced model GPT-3.5-turbo on
various out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets, demonstrating strong
generalizability to real-world tool-use scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型（LLMs）在长期交互中无法保持持久记忆的问题，以及现有记忆系统在记忆单元定义和知识提取上的局限性。

Method: 提出Nemori架构，采用两步对齐原则（基于事件分割理论）和预测校准原则（基于自由能原理），实现语义连贯的记忆组织和自适应知识进化。

Result: 在LoCoMo和LongMemEval基准测试中，Nemori显著优于现有最先进系统，尤其在长上下文环境中表现突出。

Conclusion: Nemori为自主代理的长期动态工作流提供了可行解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities, yet their
inability to maintain persistent memory in long contexts limits their
effectiveness as autonomous agents in long-term interactions. While existing
memory systems have made progress, their reliance on arbitrary granularity for
defining the basic memory unit and passive, rule-based mechanisms for knowledge
extraction limits their capacity for genuine learning and evolution. To address
these foundational limitations, we present Nemori, a novel self-organizing
memory architecture inspired by human cognitive principles. Nemori's core
innovation is twofold: First, its Two-Step Alignment Principle, inspired by
Event Segmentation Theory, provides a principled, top-down method for
autonomously organizing the raw conversational stream into semantically
coherent episodes, solving the critical issue of memory granularity. Second,
its Predict-Calibrate Principle, inspired by the Free-energy Principle, enables
the agent to proactively learn from prediction gaps, moving beyond pre-defined
heuristics to achieve adaptive knowledge evolution. This offers a viable path
toward handling the long-term, dynamic workflows of autonomous agents.
Extensive experiments on the LoCoMo and LongMemEval benchmarks demonstrate that
Nemori significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art systems, with its
advantage being particularly pronounced in longer contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM（如ChatGPT和Claude）的兴起，需要能够实时处理任务的AI代理。传统云端部署数据密集型多模态边缘任务会引入高延迟，而边缘部署又面临资源有限和异构的挑战。

Method: 提出了一种自适应框架，结合蚁群算法和LLM优化，建模资源约束和延迟/成本，实现高效决策和轻量级代理迁移。

Result: 在分布式系统上实现并验证，显著降低了部署延迟和迁移成本。

Conclusion: 该方案为动态边缘环境中LLM-based AI代理的高效部署和管理提供了有效方法。

Abstract: The rise of LLMs such as ChatGPT and Claude fuels the need for AI agents
capable of real-time task handling. However, migrating data-intensive,
multi-modal edge workloads to cloud data centers, traditionally used for agent
deployment, introduces significant latency. Deploying AI agents at the edge
improves efficiency and reduces latency. However, edge environments present
challenges due to limited and heterogeneous resources. Maintaining QoS for
mobile users necessitates agent migration, which is complicated by the
complexity of AI agents coordinating LLMs, task planning, memory, and external
tools. This paper presents the first systematic deployment and management
solution for LLM-based AI agents in dynamic edge environments. We propose a
novel adaptive framework for AI agent placement and migration in edge
intelligence systems. Our approach models resource constraints and
latency/cost, leveraging ant colony algorithms and LLM-based optimization for
efficient decision-making. It autonomously places agents to optimize resource
utilization and QoS and enables lightweight agent migration by transferring
only essential state. Implemented on a distributed system using AgentScope and
validated across globally distributed edge servers, our solution significantly
reduces deployment latency and migration costs.

Motivation: LLMs使用CoT提示时生成冗长的思维过程，导致推理成本增加和效率降低。

Method: 引入步骤熵量化推理步骤的信息贡献，提出两阶段训练策略（SFT和GRPO）以生成压缩的CoT。

Result: 实验表明80%的低熵步骤可被剪枝，对准确性影响极小，而随机或高熵剪枝会严重损害性能。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升LLM推理效率，为实际部署和对推理结构的理解提供了重要启示。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting excel at
complex reasoning but generate verbose thought processes with considerable
redundancy, leading to increased inference costs and reduced efficiency. We
introduce a novel CoT compression framework based on step entropy, a metric
that quantifies the informational contribution of individual reasoning steps to
identify redundancy. Through theoretical analysis and extensive empirical
validation on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, we demonstrate that steps with
low entropy are indeed highly redundant. Our experiments reveal that an
astonishing 80\% of low-entropy intermediate steps can be pruned with minor
degradation in the final answer accuracy across DeepSeek-R1-7B, 14B and
Qwen3-8B. This finding sharply contrasts with random or high-entropy pruning,
which severely impairs reasoning performance. Building on this, we propose a
novel two-stage training strategy combining Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning. This approach
enables LLMs to autonomously learn to generate compressed COTs during inference
by strategically incorporating [SKIP] tokens. Our method significantly enhances
LLM inference efficiency while rigorously preserving accuracy, offering
profound implications for practical LLM deployment and a deeper understanding
of reasoning structures.

Conclusion: 研究为构建临床实用且语言鲁棒的认知评估工具提供了重要进展。

Abstract: Automatic assessment of cognitive impairment from spontaneous speech offers a
promising, non-invasive avenue for early cognitive screening. However, current
approaches often lack generalizability when deployed across different languages
and clinical settings, limiting their practical utility. In this study, we
propose CogBench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the cross-lingual
and cross-site generalizability of large language models (LLMs) for
speech-based cognitive impairment assessment. Using a unified multimodal
pipeline, we evaluate model performance on three speech datasets spanning
English and Mandarin: ADReSSo, NCMMSC2021-AD, and a newly collected test set,
CIR-E. Our results show that conventional deep learning models degrade
substantially when transferred across domains. In contrast, LLMs equipped with
chain-of-thought prompting demonstrate better adaptability, though their
performance remains sensitive to prompt design. Furthermore, we explore
lightweight fine-tuning of LLMs via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), which
significantly improves generalization in target domains. These findings offer a
critical step toward building clinically useful and linguistically robust
speech-based cognitive assessment tools.

Motivation: 解决LLMs在通用逻辑推理上的缺陷，提升其确定性和可解释性。

Result: 混合方法（LLM-SS）在可解释性和保留LLMs优势方面表现更好。

Conclusion: 混合方法更适合发展通用逻辑推理，并提出了一个基于LLM-SS的通用框架。

Abstract: General logical reasoning, defined as the ability to reason deductively on
domain-agnostic tasks, continues to be a challenge for large language models
(LLMs). Current LLMs fail to reason deterministically and are not
interpretable. As such, there has been a recent surge in interest in
neurosymbolic AI, which attempts to incorporate logic into neural networks. We
first identify two main neurosymbolic approaches to improving logical
reasoning: (i) the integrative approach comprising models where symbolic
reasoning is contained within the neural network, and (ii) the hybrid approach
comprising models where a symbolic solver, separate from the neural network,
performs symbolic reasoning. Both contain AI systems with promising results on
domain-specific logical reasoning benchmarks. However, their performance on
domain-agnostic benchmarks is understudied. To the best of our knowledge, there
has not been a comparison of the contrasting approaches that answers the
following question: Which approach is more promising for developing general
logical reasoning? To analyze their potential, the following best-in-class
domain-agnostic models are introduced: Logic Neural Network (LNN), which uses
the integrative approach, and LLM-Symbolic Solver (LLM-SS), which uses the
hybrid approach. Using both models as case studies and representatives of each
approach, our analysis demonstrates that the hybrid approach is more promising
for developing general logical reasoning because (i) its reasoning chain is
more interpretable, and (ii) it retains the capabilities and advantages of
existing LLMs. To support future works using the hybrid approach, we propose a
generalizable framework based on LLM-SS that is modular by design,
model-agnostic, domain-agnostic, and requires little to no human input.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言描述在代码生成中存在模糊性，难以捕捉复杂需求和隐含数据依赖，因此需要一种更精确的方法。

Method: 1. 引入增强的UML序列图，结合决策表和API规范；2. 提出数据依赖推理（DDI）任务，构建显式数据依赖图；3. 使用数学推理和静态解析优化推理过程。

Result: 通过形式化规范和DDI任务，显著减少了模糊性，提高了代码生成的准确性和效率。

Conclusion: UML2Dep框架有效解决了自然语言描述的模糊性问题，为复杂需求下的代码生成提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating code from natural language
(NL) descriptions. However, the plain textual descriptions are inherently
ambiguous and often fail to capture complex requirements like intricate system
behaviors, conditional logic, and architectural constraints; implicit data
dependencies in service-oriented architectures are difficult to infer and
handle correctly. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel step-by-step code
generation framework named UML2Dep by leveraging unambiguous formal
specifications of complex requirements. First, we introduce an enhanced Unified
Modeling Language (UML) sequence diagram tailored for service-oriented
architectures. This diagram extends traditional visual syntax by integrating
decision tables and API specifications, explicitly formalizing structural
relationships and business logic flows in service interactions to rigorously
eliminate linguistic ambiguity. Second, recognizing the critical role of data
flow, we introduce a dedicated data dependency inference (DDI) task. DDI
systematically constructs an explicit data dependency graph prior to actual
code synthesis. To ensure reliability, we formalize DDI as a constrained
mathematical reasoning task through novel prompting strategies, aligning with
LLMs' excellent mathematical strengths. Additional static parsing and
dependency pruning further reduce context complexity and cognitive load
associated with intricate specifications, thereby enhancing reasoning accuracy
and efficiency.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在复杂错误识别和诊断方面表现不佳，主要因为训练目标偏向正确答案，缺乏对错误的学习。

Method: 提出Hide and Seek Game（HSG）框架，包含生成错误（Sneaky）和诊断错误（Diagnosis）的对抗性角色，通过动态对抗提升能力。

Result: HSG在数学推理任务中显著优于基线（如GPT-4o），错误诊断准确率提升16.8%--31.4%。

Conclusion: HSG框架有效提升了错误诊断能力，并发布了具有挑战性的数据集，为未来研究提供基准。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in reasoning and generation across
domains, but still struggle with identifying and diagnosing complex errors.
This stems mainly from training objectives that prioritize correct answers,
limiting exposure to and learning from errors. While recent studies have begun
to address this by introducing error signals, most rely on shallow, static
errors, restricting improvement in deep diagnostic ability. To overcome this,
we propose Hide and Seek Game (HSG), a dynamic adversarial framework for error
generation and diagnosis, and evaluate it on mathematical problem-solving. HSG
involves two adversarial roles: Sneaky, which "hides" by generating subtle,
deceptive reasoning errors, and Diagnosis, which "seeks" to accurately detect
them. Through adversarial co-evolution, both error stealth and diagnostic
precision are enhanced. Experiments on several math reasoning tasks show that
HSG significantly boosts error diagnosis, achieving 16.8\%--31.4\% higher
accuracy than baselines like GPT-4o. We also release a challenging dataset of
deceptive errors and diagnostic annotations as a benchmark for future research.

Motivation: 解决现有LLM方法无法处理多调整需求的不可行模型问题。

Method: 结合多目标优化和LLM代理，生成权衡解并分析。

Result: 在50类问题中，MOID单次运行提供多建议，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MOID为恢复模型可行性和决策提供更实用见解。

Abstract: In real-world routing problems, users often propose conflicting or
unreasonable requirements, which result in infeasible optimization models due
to overly restrictive or contradictory constraints, leading to an empty
feasible solution set. Existing Large Language Model (LLM)-based methods
attempt to diagnose infeasible models, but modifying such models often involves
multiple potential adjustments that these methods do not consider. To fill this
gap, we introduce Multi-Objective Infeasibility Diagnosis (MOID), which
combines LLM agents and multi-objective optimization within an automatic
routing solver, to provide a set of representative actionable suggestions.
Specifically, MOID employs multi-objective optimization to consider both path
cost and constraint violation, generating a set of trade-off solutions, each
encompassing varying degrees of model adjustments. To extract practical
insights from these solutions, MOID utilizes LLM agents to generate a solution
analysis function for the infeasible model. This function analyzes these
distinct solutions to diagnose the original infeasible model, providing users
with diverse diagnostic insights and suggestions. Finally, we compare MOID with
several LLM-based methods on 50 types of infeasible routing problems. The
results indicate that MOID automatically generates multiple diagnostic
suggestions in a single run, providing more practical insights for restoring
model feasibility and decision-making compared to existing methods.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of publicly-available medical data presents a challenge
for clinicians and researchers alike, increasing the gap between the volume of
scientific literature and its applications. The steady growth of studies and
findings overwhelms medical professionals at large, hindering their ability to
systematically review and understand the latest knowledge. This paper presents
an approach to information extraction and automatic knowledge graph (KG)
generation to identify and connect biomedical knowledge. Through a pipeline of
large language model (LLM) agents, the system decomposes 44 PubMed abstracts
into semantically meaningful proposition sentences and extracts KG triples from
these sentences. The triples are enhanced using a combination of open domain
and ontology-based information extraction methodologies to incorporate
ontological categories. On top of this, a context variable is included during
extraction to allow the triple to stand on its own - thereby becoming
`quadruples'. The extraction accuracy of the LLM is validated by comparing
natural language sentences generated from the enhanced triples to the original
propositions, achieving an average cosine similarity of 0.874. The similarity
for generated sentences of enhanced triples were compared with generated
sentences of ordinary triples showing an increase as a result of the context
variable. Furthermore, this research explores the ability for LLMs to infer new
relationships and connect clusters in the knowledge base of the knowledge
graph. This approach leads the way to provide medical practitioners with a
centralised, updated in real-time, and sustainable knowledge source, and may be
the foundation of similar gains in a wide variety of fields.

Abstract: Belief systems are often treated as globally consistent sets of propositions
or as scalar-valued probability distributions. Such representations tend to
obscure the internal structure of belief, conflate external credibility with
internal coherence, and preclude the modeling of fragmented or contradictory
epistemic states. This paper introduces a minimal formalism for belief systems
as directed, weighted graphs. In this framework, nodes represent individual
beliefs, edges encode epistemic relationships (e.g., support or contradiction),
and two distinct functions assign each belief a credibility (reflecting source
trust) and a confidence (derived from internal structural support). Unlike
classical probabilistic models, our approach does not assume prior coherence or
require belief updating. Unlike logical and argumentation-based frameworks, it
supports fine-grained structural representation without committing to binary
justification status or deductive closure. The model is purely static and
deliberately excludes inference or revision procedures. Its aim is to provide a
foundational substrate for analyzing the internal organization of belief
systems, including coherence conditions, epistemic tensions, and
representational limits. By distinguishing belief structure from belief
strength, this formalism enables a richer classification of epistemic states
than existing probabilistic, logical, or argumentation-based approaches.

TL;DR: SmartGen是一个基于LLM的框架，用于生成上下文感知的用户行为数据，以支持智能家居模型的持续适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能家居模型通常基于静态数据集训练，难以应对行为漂移（如季节变化、生活方式改变等），而新数据收集成本高且隐私敏感。

Method: SmartGen包含四个关键组件：时间与语义感知分割、语义感知序列压缩、图引导序列合成和两阶段异常过滤器。

Result: 实验表明，SmartGen显著提升了行为漂移下的异常检测（85.43%）和行为预测（70.51%）性能。

Conclusion: SmartGen通过生成高质量合成数据，有效解决了行为漂移问题，提升了智能家居模型的适应能力。

Abstract: As smart homes become increasingly prevalent, intelligent models are widely
used for tasks such as anomaly detection and behavior prediction. These models
are typically trained on static datasets, making them brittle to behavioral
drift caused by seasonal changes, lifestyle shifts, or evolving routines.
However, collecting new behavior data for retraining is often impractical due
to its slow pace, high cost, and privacy concerns. In this paper, we propose
SmartGen, an LLM-based framework that synthesizes context-aware user behavior
data to support continual adaptation of downstream smart home models. SmartGen
consists of four key components. First, we design a Time and Semantic-aware
Split module to divide long behavior sequences into manageable, semantically
coherent subsequences under dual time-span constraints. Second, we propose
Semantic-aware Sequence Compression to reduce input length while preserving
representative semantics by clustering behavior mapping in latent space. Third,
we introduce Graph-guided Sequence Synthesis, which constructs a behavior
relationship graph and encodes frequent transitions into prompts, guiding the
LLM to generate data aligned with contextual changes while retaining core
behavior patterns. Finally, we design a Two-stage Outlier Filter to identify
and remove implausible or semantically inconsistent outputs, aiming to improve
the factual coherence and behavioral validity of the generated sequences.
Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that SmartGen
significantly enhances model performance on anomaly detection and behavior
prediction tasks under behavioral drift, with anomaly detection improving by
85.43% and behavior prediction by 70.51% on average. The code is available at

TL;DR: EDCIM是一种用于检测和纠正大型语言模型在数学任务中生成错误的方法，通过结合轻量级和强大模型优化成本与准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在多步推理中存在错误传播和格式不匹配问题，尤其在数学任务中表现不佳。

Method: EDCIM通过生成方程组、符号错误检测框架和针对性反馈，结合不同性能的LLMs优化效率。

Result: 实验表明，EDCIM显著降低了计算和财务成本，同时保持或提高了预测准确性。

Conclusion: EDCIM通过平衡成本和准确性，有效解决了LLMs在数学任务中的错误问题。

Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to perform
explicit multi-step reasoning such as chain-of-thought prompting. However,
their intermediate steps often contain errors that can propagate leading to
inaccurate final predictions. Additionally, LLMs still struggle with
hallucinations and often fail to adhere to prescribed output formats, which is
particularly problematic for tasks like generating mathematical expressions or
source code. This work introduces EDCIM (Error Detection and Correction for
Interpretable Mathematics), a method for detecting and correcting these errors
in interpretable mathematics tasks, where the model must generate the exact
functional form that explicitly solve the problem (expressed in natural
language) rather than a black-box solution. EDCIM uses LLMs to generate a
system of equations for a given problem, followed by a symbolic error-detection
framework that identifies errors and provides targeted feedback for LLM-based
correction. To optimize efficiency, EDCIM integrates lightweight, open-source
LLMs with more powerful proprietary models, balancing cost and accuracy. This
balance is controlled by a single hyperparameter, allowing users to control the
trade-off based on their cost and accuracy requirements. Experimental results
across different datasets show that EDCIM significantly reduces both
computational and financial costs, while maintaining, and even improving,
prediction accuracy when the balance is properly configured.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究首次全面分析了Transformer训练过程中大规模激活的出现规律，发现其遵循可预测的数学模式，并开发了一个机器学习框架来预测这些模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大规模激活对模型功能至关重要，但其在训练过程中出现的动态特性尚未被充分理解。

Method: 使用Pythia模型家族进行系统分析，通过检查不同模型大小和训练检查点，发现大规模激活的出现遵循指数调制的对数函数。

Result: 开发了一个机器学习框架，能够仅从架构规格预测大规模激活的数学参数，对稳态行为预测准确度高，对出现时间和规模的预测准确度中等。

Conclusion: 大规模激活的出现受模型设计影响，可在训练前预测甚至控制，对模型稳定性、训练周期、可解释性和优化有重要意义。

Abstract: Massive activations are scalar values in transformer hidden states that
achieve values orders of magnitude larger than typical activations and have
been shown to be critical for model functionality. While prior work has
characterized these phenomena in fully trained models, the temporal dynamics of
their emergence during training remain poorly understood. We present the first
comprehensive analysis of massive activation development throughout transformer
training, using the Pythia model family as our testbed. Through systematic
analysis of various model sizes across multiple training checkpoints, we
demonstrate that massive activation emergence follows predictable mathematical
patterns that can be accurately modeled using an exponentially-modulated
logarithmic function with five key parameters. We develop a machine learning
framework to predict these mathematical parameters from architectural
specifications alone, achieving high accuracy for steady-state behavior and
moderate accuracy for emergence timing and magnitude. These findings enable
architects to predict and potentially control key aspects of massive activation
emergence through design choices, with significant implications for model
stability, training cycle length, interpretability, and optimization. Our
findings demonstrate that the emergence of massive activations is governed by
model design and can be anticipated, and potentially controlled, before
training begins.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM代码生成能力的提升，其对输入前提的依赖加深，错误前提易导致生成幻觉，暴露模型自检能力不足。

Method: 提出FPBench框架，系统构建三类错误前提并整合多维评估指标，对15个LLM进行深入评估。

Result: 多数模型在错误前提下的推理和生成表现不佳，资源投入存在边际效应，三类错误前提分别激活不同缺陷模式。

Conclusion: 研究强调LLM需主动验证前提，FPBench为开发可靠、以人为本的代码生成模型提供了理论和实践基础。

Abstract: With the advancement of code generation capabilities in large language models
(LLMs), their reliance on input premises has intensified. When users provide
inputs containing faulty premises, the probability of code generation
hallucinations rises significantly, exposing deficiencies in their
self-scrutiny capabilities. This paper proposes Faulty Premises Bench
(FPBench), the first code generation evaluation framework targeting faulty
premises. By systematically constructing three categories of faulty premises
and integrating multi-dimensional evaluation metrics, it conducts in-depth
assessments of 15 representative LLMs. The key findings are as follows: (1)
Most models exhibit poor reasoning abilities and suboptimal code generation
performance under faulty premises, heavily relying on explicit prompts for
error detection, with limited self-scrutiny capabilities; (2) Faulty premises
trigger a point of diminishing returns in resource investment, leading to
blindly increasing length fails to enhance quality; (3) The three types of
faulty premises respectively activate distinct defect patterns in models,
revealing a triple dissociation in the cognitive mechanisms of code generation
models. This study not only highlights the urgent need for LLMs to proactively
verify premises in code generation but also, through the proposed FPBench
framework and multi-dimensional evaluation system, provides a theoretical
foundation and practical pathway for developing reliable, human-centric code
generation models.

Motivation: 现有方法（如匹配滤波和深度神经网络）在引力波信号识别中存在计算量大或决策逻辑不透明的问题，需要一种更高效且可解释的解决方案。

Method: Evo-MCTS框架通过结合树状搜索、进化优化和大型语言模型启发式，系统地探索算法空间，并生成可解释的算法解决方案。

Result: 在MLGWSC-1数据集上，Evo-MCTS比现有方法性能提升20.2%，并发现了新的算法组合。

Conclusion: Evo-MCTS不仅提升了性能，还提供了一种可迁移的自动化算法发现方法，适用于更广泛的科学计算领域。

Abstract: Computational scientific discovery increasingly relies on algorithms to
process complex data and identify meaningful patterns - yet faces persistent
challenges in gravitational-wave signal identification. While existing
algorithmic approaches like matched filtering (MF) and deep neural networks
(DNNs) have achieved partial success, their limitations directly stem from
fundamental limitations: MF's excessive computational demands arise from its
reliance on predefined theoretical waveform templates, while DNNs' black-box
architectures obscure decision logic and introduce hidden biases. We propose
Evolutionary Monte Carlo Tree Search (Evo-MCTS), a framework that addresses
these limitations through systematic algorithm space exploration guided by
domain-aware physical constraints. Our approach combines tree-structured search
with evolutionary optimization and large language model heuristics to create
interpretable algorithmic solutions. Our Evo-MCTS framework demonstrates
substantial improvements, achieving a 20.2\% improvement over state-of-the-art
gravitational wave detection algorithms on the MLGWSC-1 benchmark dataset.
High-performing algorithm variants consistently exceed thresholds. The
framework generates human-interpretable algorithmic pathways that reveal
distinct performance patterns. Beyond performance improvements, our framework
discovers novel algorithmic combinations, thereby establishing a transferable
methodology for automated algorithmic discovery across computational science
domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常将RL训练与代理紧密耦合或依赖序列拼接与掩码，限制了灵活性和通用性。Agent Lightning旨在解决这些问题，提供更通用的训练方案。

Method: 通过将代理执行建模为马尔可夫决策过程，定义统一数据接口，并提出分层RL算法LightningRL，包含信用分配模块，以分解代理生成的轨迹为训练数据。

Result: 实验在文本到SQL、检索增强生成和数学工具使用任务中展示了稳定且持续的改进，验证了框架的实际潜力。

Conclusion: Agent Lightning为现实世界中的代理训练和部署提供了高效、灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: We present Agent Lightning, a flexible and extensible framework that enables
Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based training of Large Language Models (LLMs) for
any AI agent. Unlike existing methods that tightly couple RL training with
agent or rely on sequence concatenation with masking, Agent Lightning achieves
complete decoupling between agent execution and training, allowing seamless
integration with existing agents developed via diverse ways (e.g., using
frameworks like LangChain, OpenAI Agents SDK, AutoGen, and building from
scratch) with almost ZERO code modifications. By formulating agent execution as
Markov decision process, we define an unified data interface and propose a
hierarchical RL algorithm, LightningRL, which contains a credit assignment
module, allowing us to decompose trajectories generated by ANY agents into
training transition. This enables RL to handle complex interaction logic, such
as multi-agent scenarios and dynamic workflows. For the system design, we
introduce a Training-Agent Disaggregation architecture, and brings agent
observability frameworks into agent runtime, providing a standardized agent
finetuning interface. Experiments across text-to-SQL, retrieval-augmented
generation, and math tool-use tasks demonstrate stable, continuous
improvements, showcasing the framework's potential for real-world agent
training and deployment.

Conclusion: ICARE为放射学报告生成提供了透明、可解释且临床相关的评估方法。

Abstract: Radiological imaging is central to diagnosis, treatment planning, and
clinical decision-making. Vision-language foundation models have spurred
interest in automated radiology report generation (RRG), but safe deployment
requires reliable clinical evaluation of generated reports. Existing metrics
often rely on surface-level similarity or behave as black boxes, lacking
interpretability. We introduce ICARE (Interpretable and Clinically-grounded
Agent-based Report Evaluation), an interpretable evaluation framework
leveraging large language model agents and dynamic multiple-choice question
answering (MCQA). Two agents, each with either the ground-truth or generated
report, generate clinically meaningful questions and quiz each other. Agreement
on answers captures preservation and consistency of findings, serving as
interpretable proxies for clinical precision and recall. By linking scores to
question-answer pairs, ICARE enables transparent, and interpretable assessment.
Clinician studies show ICARE aligns significantly more with expert judgment
than prior metrics. Perturbation analyses confirm sensitivity to clinical
content and reproducibility, while model comparisons reveal interpretable error
patterns.

Result: DEM-MoE在分歧高的数据集上表现优异；LLM生成的合成标注与人类标注中度一致；混合策略的效果取决于数据集结构。

Conclusion: DEM-MoE和合成数据策略共同提升了多样化视角的表示能力。

Abstract: We present an approach to modeling annotator disagreement in subjective NLP
tasks through both architectural and data-centric innovations. Our model,
DEM-MoE (Demographic-Aware Mixture of Experts), routes inputs to expert
subnetworks based on annotator demographics, enabling it to better represent
structured, group-level variation compared to prior models. DEM-MoE
consistently performs competitively across demographic groups, and shows
especially strong results on datasets with high annotator disagreement. To
address sparse demographic coverage, we test whether LLM-generated synthetic
annotations via zero-shot persona prompting can be used for data imputation. We
show these synthetic judgments align moderately well with human annotations on
our data and offer a scalable way to potentially enrich training data. We then
propose and evaluate approaches for blending real and synthetic data using
strategies tailored to dataset structure. We find that the optimal strategies
depend on dataset structure. Together, these contributions improve the
representation of diverse perspectives.

Motivation: 防止LLMs被越狱或劫持是一个重要但具有挑战性的任务，现有方法容易被绕过。

Method: H&S将RAG流程分为高亮器（提取相关段落）和总结器（生成答案），避免直接暴露用户问题给生成模型。

Result: 实验表明，基于LLM的高亮器生成的H&S响应在正确性、相关性和质量上优于标准RAG流程。

Conclusion: H&S通过设计防止攻击，同时提升了响应质量。

Abstract: Preventing jailbreaking and model hijacking of Large Language Models (LLMs)
is an important yet challenging task. For example, when interacting with a
chatbot, malicious users can input specially crafted prompts to cause the LLM
to generate undesirable content or perform a completely different task from its
intended purpose. Existing mitigations for such attacks typically rely on
hardening the LLM's system prompt or using a content classifier trained to
detect undesirable content or off-topic conversations. However, these
probabilistic approaches are relatively easy to bypass due to the very large
space of possible inputs and undesirable outputs. In this paper, we present and
evaluate Highlight & Summarize (H&S), a new design pattern for
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems that prevents these attacks by
design. The core idea is to perform the same task as a standard RAG pipeline
(i.e., to provide natural language answers to questions, based on relevant
sources) without ever revealing the user's question to the generative LLM. This
is achieved by splitting the pipeline into two components: a highlighter, which
takes the user's question and extracts relevant passages ("highlights") from
the retrieved documents, and a summarizer, which takes the highlighted passages
and summarizes them into a cohesive answer. We describe several possible
instantiations of H&S and evaluate their generated responses in terms of
correctness, relevance, and response quality. Surprisingly, when using an
LLM-based highlighter, the majority of H&S responses are judged to be better
than those of a standard RAG pipeline.

Motivation: 研究Merge作为句法核心操作的神经认知基础，探索其在不同复杂度结构中的表现。

Method: 通过系统分析参与者对复杂度递增句子的理解，进行聚类分析。

Result: 行为数据显示三种不同的结构类型，可能与不同发展阶段和选择性损伤相关。

Conclusion: Merge可能在进化中突然出现，但处理不同类型Merge结构的认知机制可能不同。

Abstract: In the modern language sciences, the core computational operation of syntax,
'Merge', is defined as an operation that combines two linguistic units (e.g.,
'brown', 'cat') to form a categorized structure ('brown cat', a Noun Phrase).
This can then be further combined with additional linguistic units based on
this categorial information, respecting non-associativity such that abstract
grouping is respected. Some linguists have embraced the view that Merge is an
elementary, indivisible operation that emerged in a single evolutionary step.
From a neurocognitive standpoint, different mental objects constructed by Merge
may be supported by distinct mechanisms: (1) simple command constructions
(e.g., "eat apples"); (2) the merging of adjectives and nouns ("red boat"); and
(3) the merging of nouns with spatial prepositions ("laptop behind the sofa").
Here, we systematically investigate participants' comprehension of sentences
with increasing levels of syntactic complexity. Clustering analyses revealed
behavioral evidence for three distinct structural types, which we discuss as
potentially emerging at different developmental stages and subject to selective
impairment. While a Merge-based syntax may still have emerged suddenly in
evolutionary time, responsible for the structured symbolic turn our species
took, different cognitive mechanisms seem to underwrite the processing of
various types of Merge-based objects.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型和视觉语言模型在复杂多模态推理任务中表现不佳，缺乏深度推理能力，需要改进。

Method: CMRF框架包含三个模块：RDU分解问题、CIE进行上下文推理、CAM评估逻辑一致性，并结合自适应迭代优化策略。

Result: CMRF在多个基准测试中达到69.4%的平均准确率，比最佳开源基线高2.4个百分点。

Conclusion: CMRF通过模块化设计和迭代优化，显著提升了多模态模型的推理能力，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements, current large language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (LVLMs) continue to struggle with complex, multi-step,
cross-modal common sense reasoning tasks, often exhibiting a lack of
"deliberative thinking." They tend to rely on superficial associations rather
than deep, chained inference, particularly when integrating visual information
with abstract concepts. To address this, we propose the Coherent Multimodal
Reasoning Framework (CMRF), a novel approach that enhances LVLMs' common sense
reasoning capabilities through an iterative, self-evaluating inference
mechanism. CMRF mimics human problem-solving by decomposing complex queries,
generating step-by-step inferences, and self-correcting errors. Our framework
integrates three key modules: a Reasoning Decomposition Unit (RDU) for breaking
down problems into sub-questions, a Contextual Inference Engine (CIE) for
contextual inference, and a Coherence Assessment Module (CAM) for evaluating
logical consistency and confidence. Coupled with an Adaptive Iterative
Refinement strategy, CMRF systematically refines its reasoning paths. Built
upon LLaVA-1.6-34B and trained on a novel Multimodal Daily Activity Reasoning
(MDAR) dataset, CMRF achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source
LVLMs on challenging benchmarks like VCR, A-OKVQA, and DailyLife-MRC. It
attains an average accuracy of 69.4%, surpassing the best open-source baseline
by +2.4 percentage points, with particular strength in complex reasoning
scenarios. Extensive ablation studies and human evaluations confirm the
critical contributions of each module and the effectiveness of iterative
refinement in fostering more coherent and accurate reasoning.

Result: 低维LIWC特征（r=24）在预测感官语言时表现与全特征集（r=74）相当，SLIM-LLMs参数减少80%但性能接近全规模模型。

Conclusion: SLIM-LLMs在保持性能的同时显著减少参数，为高效语言建模提供了新思路。

Abstract: Sensorial language -- the language connected to our senses including vision,
sound, touch, taste, smell, and interoception, plays a fundamental role in how
we communicate experiences and perceptions. We explore the relationship between
sensorial language and traditional stylistic features, like those measured by
LIWC, using a novel Reduced-Rank Ridge Regression (R4) approach. We demonstrate
that low-dimensional latent representations of LIWC features r = 24 effectively
capture stylistic information for sensorial language prediction compared to the
full feature set (r = 74). We introduce Stylometrically Lean Interpretable
Models (SLIM-LLMs), which model non-linear relationships between these style
dimensions. Evaluated across five genres, SLIM-LLMs with low-rank LIWC features
match the performance of full-scale language models while reducing parameters
by up to 80%.

Abstract: The widespread use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in many applications marks
a significant advance in research and practice. However, their complexity and
hard-to-understand nature make them vulnerable to attacks, especially
jailbreaks designed to produce harmful responses. To counter these threats,
developing strong detection methods is essential for the safe and reliable use
of LLMs. This paper studies this detection problem using the Contextual
Co-occurrence Matrix, a structure recognized for its efficacy in data-scarce
environments. We propose a novel method leveraging the latent space
characteristics of Contextual Co-occurrence Matrices and Tensors for the
effective identification of adversarial and jailbreak prompts. Our evaluations
show that this approach achieves a notable F1 score of 0.83 using only 0.5% of
labeled prompts, which is a 96.6% improvement over baselines. This result
highlights the strength of our learned patterns, especially when labeled data
is scarce. Our method is also significantly faster, speedup ranging from 2.3 to
128.4 times compared to the baseline models. To support future research and
reproducibility, we have made our implementation publicly available.

TL;DR: 论文通过12年分析揭示了AI生成艺术讨论中艺术家声音的边缘化，发现技术术语可能成为排斥艺术家关切的隐形门槛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在揭示艺术家在AI生成艺术讨论中的边缘化现象及其原因。

Method: 采用可重复的方法论，分析439份500字摘录，识别出五个稳定主题簇。

Result: 发现艺术家观点与主流媒体叙事不一致，技术术语可能排斥艺术家关切。

Conclusion: 呼吁在AI创意领域更透明地纳入艺术家视角，并提供BERTopic方法论和多模态基线。

Abstract: As generative AI continues to reshape artistic production and alternate modes
of human expression, artists whose livelihoods are most directly affected have
raised urgent concerns about consent, transparency, and the future of creative
labor. However, the voices of artists are often marginalized in dominant public
and scholarly discourse. This study presents a twelve-year analysis, from 2013
to 2025, of English-language discourse surrounding AI-generated art. It draws
from 439 curated 500-word excerpts sampled from opinion articles, news reports,
blogs, legal filings, and spoken-word transcripts. Through a reproducible
methodology, we identify five stable thematic clusters and uncover a
misalignment between artists' perceptions and prevailing media narratives. Our
findings highlight how the use of technical jargon can function as a subtle
form of gatekeeping, often sidelining the very issues artists deem most urgent.
Our work provides a BERTopic-based methodology and a multimodal baseline for
future research, alongside a clear call for deeper, transparency-driven
engagement with artist perspectives in the evolving AI-creative landscape.

*Haoran Wang,Xiongxiao Xu,Baixiang Huang,Kai Shu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为PAD的轻量级防御方法，通过在生成时向token logits注入高斯噪声，保护RAG系统中的敏感数据，同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG系统在处理敏感数据时容易受到提取攻击，导致隐私泄露，需要一种无需重新训练或大规模过滤的轻量级防御方法。

Method: PAD采用自适应注入高斯噪声、基于置信度的筛选、高效敏感性估计和上下文感知噪声校准，结合RDP会计跟踪隐私损失。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上的实验表明，PAD显著减少隐私泄露，同时保持生成质量，优于现有防御方法。

Conclusion: PAD为RAG系统提供了一种通用且可扩展的隐私保护解决方案，通过解码策略有效降低隐私风险。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the factual accuracy of large
language models (LLMs) by conditioning outputs on external knowledge sources.
However, when retrieval involves private or sensitive data, RAG systems are
susceptible to extraction attacks that can leak confidential information
through generated responses. We propose Privacy-Aware Decoding (PAD), a
lightweight, inference-time defense that adaptively injects calibrated Gaussian
noise into token logits during generation. PAD integrates confidence-based
screening to selectively protect high-risk tokens, efficient sensitivity
estimation to minimize unnecessary noise, and context-aware noise calibration
to balance privacy with generation quality. A \renyi Differential Privacy (RDP)
accountant rigorously tracks cumulative privacy loss, enabling explicit
per-response $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP guarantees for sensitive outputs.
Unlike prior approaches requiring retraining or corpus-level filtering, PAD is
model-agnostic and operates entirely at decoding time with minimal
computational overhead. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate
that PAD substantially reduces private information leakage while preserving
response utility, outperforming existing retrieval- and post-processing-based
defenses. Our work takes an important step toward mitigating privacy risks in
RAG via decoding strategies, paving the way for universal and scalable privacy
solutions in sensitive domains. Our code is available:

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对检索增强生成（RAG）系统的新型攻击框架TPARAG，通过轻量级白盒LLM生成并优化恶意文本，显著提升了攻击效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管RAG框架解决了LLMs的幻觉和知识过时问题，但其引入的外部知识库可能被恶意利用，现有攻击方法在检索和生成阶段的联合考虑不足。

Method: 提出TPARAG框架，利用白盒LLM生成并迭代优化恶意文本，针对检索和生成阶段进行联合攻击。

Result: 实验表明TPARAG在检索阶段和端到端攻击效果上优于现有方法，揭示了RAG系统的关键漏洞。

Conclusion: TPARAG揭示了RAG系统的安全风险，为提升其鲁棒性提供了新思路。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in
providing trustworthy responses for knowledge-intensive tasks, they still face
critical limitations such as hallucinations and outdated knowledge. To address
these issues, the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework enhances LLMs
with access to external knowledge via a retriever, enabling more accurate and
real-time outputs about the latest events. However, this integration brings new
security vulnerabilities: the risk that malicious content in the external
database can be retrieved and used to manipulate model outputs. Although prior
work has explored attacks on RAG systems, existing approaches either rely
heavily on access to the retriever or fail to jointly consider both retrieval
and generation stages, limiting their effectiveness, particularly in black-box
scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose Token-level Precise Attack
on the RAG (TPARAG), a novel framework that targets both white-box and
black-box RAG systems. TPARAG leverages a lightweight white-box LLM as an
attacker to generate and iteratively optimize malicious passages at the token
level, ensuring both retrievability and high attack success in generation.
Extensive experiments on open-domain QA datasets demonstrate that TPARAG
consistently outperforms previous approaches in retrieval-stage and end-to-end
attack effectiveness. These results further reveal critical vulnerabilities in
RAG pipelines and offer new insights into improving their robustness.

TL;DR: 研究分析了英语-阿拉伯语可比文本在情感和情绪上的差异，提出了一种跨语言标注方法，并发现来自同一新闻机构的文章情感标注更一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可比文本是多语言中对齐的主题文档，非直接翻译，有助于理解不同语言中主题的讨论方式。研究旨在探索英语-阿拉伯语可比文档在情感和情绪上的差异。

Method: 首先标注情感和情绪标签，采用跨语言方法标注意见类别（主观/客观），避免依赖机器翻译。手动翻译英语情感词典为阿拉伯语，创建双语情感词典用于标注。统计方法评估文档对中情感和情绪的一致性。

Result: 结果显示，来自同一新闻机构的文章情感和情绪标注更一致，而来自不同机构的则存在差异。

Conclusion: 该方法语言无关，可推广到其他语言对。

Abstract: Comparable texts are topic-aligned documents in multiple languages that are
not direct translations. They are valuable for understanding how a topic is
discussed across languages. This research studies differences in sentiments and
emotions across English-Arabic comparable documents. First, texts are annotated
with sentiment and emotion labels. We apply a cross-lingual method to label
documents with opinion classes (subjective/objective), avoiding reliance on
machine translation. To annotate with emotions (anger, disgust, fear, joy,
sadness, surprise), we manually translate the English WordNet-Affect (WNA)
lexicon into Arabic, creating bilingual emotion lexicons used to label the
comparable corpora. We then apply a statistical measure to assess the agreement
of sentiments and emotions in each source-target document pair. This comparison
is especially relevant when the documents originate from different sources. To
our knowledge, this aspect has not been explored in prior literature. Our study
includes English-Arabic document pairs from Euronews, BBC, and Al-Jazeera
(JSC). Results show that sentiment and emotion annotations align when articles
come from the same news agency and diverge when they come from different ones.
The proposed method is language-independent and generalizable to other language
pairs.

Result: 相比之前的方法，能够生成更高质量的长故事。

Conclusion: 多智能体结构和记忆存储模型有效提升了长文本生成的质量和连贯性。

Abstract: The generation of a long story consisting of several thousand words is a
sub-task in the field of long text generation~(LTG). Previous research has
addressed this challenge through outline-based generation, which employs a
multi-stage method for generating outlines into stories. However, this approach
suffers from two common issues: almost inevitable theme drift caused by the
loss of memory of previous outlines, and tedious plots with incoherent logic
that are less appealing to human readers.
  In this paper, we propose the multi-agent Story Generator structure to
improve the multi-stage method, using large language models~(LLMs) as the core
components of agents. To avoid theme drift, we introduce a memory storage model
comprising two components: a long-term memory storage that identifies the most
important memories, thereby preventing theme drift; and a short-term memory
storage that retains the latest outlines from each generation round. To
incorporate engaging elements into the story, we design a story theme obstacle
framework based on literary narratology theory that introduces uncertain
factors and evaluation criteria to generate outline. This framework calculates
the similarity of the former storyline and enhances the appeal of the story by
building a knowledge graph and integrating new node content. Additionally, we
establish a multi-agent interaction stage to simulate writer-reader interaction
through dialogue and revise the story text according to feedback, to ensure it
remains consistent and logical. Evaluations against previous methods
demonstrate that our approach can generate higher-quality long stories.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有合并方法导致推理能力退化或输出混乱的问题，实现双能力模型的低成本构建。

Method: 利用推理能力指标，选择性合并领域专用权重，保留核心推理能力。

Result: 在生物医学和金融领域实验中，性能提升9.5%和9.2%，且不损害原有推理能力。

Conclusion: RCP-Merging是一种高效的双能力模型合并方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with long chain-of-thought (CoT) capability,
termed Reasoning Models, demonstrate superior intricate problem-solving
abilities through multi-step long CoT reasoning. To create a dual-capability
model with long CoT capability and domain-specific knowledge without
substantial computational and data costs, model merging emerges as a highly
resource-efficient method. However, significant challenges lie in merging
domain-specific LLMs with long CoT ones since nowadays merging methods suffer
from reasoning capability degradation, even gibberish output and output
collapse. To overcome this, we introduce RCP-Merging: Merging Long
Chain-of-Thought Models with Domain-Specific Models by Considering Reasoning
Capability as Prior, a novel merging framework designed to integrate
domain-specific LLMs with long CoT capability, meanwhile maintaining model
performance in the original domain. Treating reasoning model weights as
foundational prior, our method utilizes a reasoning capability indicator to
preserve core long CoT capability model weights while selectively merging
essential domain-specific weights. We conducted extensive experiments on
Qwen2.5-7B, Llama3.1-8B, and Qwen2.5-1.5B models in BioMedicine and Finance
domains. Our results show that RCP-Merging successfully merges a reasoning
model with domain-specific ones, improving domain task performance by 9.5% and
9.2% over state-of-the-art methods, without significantly harming the original
long CoT reasoning capability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种框架，通过预览和自检的严格推理过程，提升LLM在复杂指令下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在数学、编程和谜题解决上表现优异，但在复杂指令下的准确性仍不一致，主要原因是推理阶段的懒惰。

Method: 生成复杂约束的指令并过滤，构建三类提示数据集；通过拒绝采样和熵保持的监督微调（Entropy-SFT）结合基于规则的密集奖励强化学习（TEA-RL），优化模型推理机制。

Result: 实验显示，Light-IF-32B模型在指令遵循任务上表现优异，超越开源和闭源模型。

Conclusion: 提出的框架显著提升了LLM在复杂指令下的推理能力和指令遵循表现。

Abstract: While advancements in the reasoning abilities of LLMs have significantly
enhanced their performance in solving mathematical problems, coding tasks, and
general puzzles, their effectiveness in accurately adhering to instructions
remains inconsistent, particularly with more complex directives. Our
investigation identifies lazy reasoning during the thinking stage as the
primary factor contributing to poor instruction adherence. To mitigate this
issue, we propose a comprehensive framework designed to enable rigorous
reasoning processes involving preview and self-checking, essential for
satisfying strict instruction constraints. Specifically, we first generate
instructions with complex constraints and apply a filtering process to obtain
valid prompts, resulting in three distinct prompt datasets categorized as hard,
easy, and pass. Then, we employ rejection sampling on the pass prompts to
curate a small yet high-quality dataset, enabling a cold-start initialization
of the model and facilitating its adaptation to effective reasoning patterns.
Subsequently, we employ an entropy-preserving supervised fine-tuning
(Entropy-SFT) strategy coupled with token-wise entropy-adaptive (TEA-RL)
reinforcement learning guided by rule-based dense rewards. This approach
encourages the model to transform its reasoning mechanism, ultimately fostering
generalizable reasoning abilities that encompass preview and self-checking.
Extensive experiments conducted on instruction-following benchmarks demonstrate
remarkable performance improvements across various model scales. Notably, our
Light-IF-32B model surpasses both larger open-source models such as DeepSeek-R1
and closed-source models like Doubao-1.6.

Conclusion: 意识形态和执政责任共同塑造议会话语，研究为议会动态提供了新见解。

Abstract: This study investigates political discourse in the German parliament, the
Bundestag, by analyzing approximately 28,000 parliamentary speeches from the
last five years. Two machine learning models for topic and sentiment
classification were developed and trained on a manually labeled dataset. The
models showed strong classification performance, achieving an area under the
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.94 for topic
classification (average across topics) and 0.89 for sentiment classification.
Both models were applied to assess topic trends and sentiment distributions
across political parties and over time. The analysis reveals remarkable
relationships between parties and their role in parliament. In particular, a
change in style can be observed for parties moving from government to
opposition. While ideological positions matter, governing responsibilities also
shape discourse. The analysis directly addresses key questions about the
evolution of topics, sentiment dynamics, and party-specific discourse
strategies in the Bundestag.

Motivation: 探讨语法性别如何影响多语言中视觉表现，填补了现有研究对语言结构影响的忽视。

Method: 构建跨语言基准数据集，涵盖五种有性别语言和两种无性别语言，生成28,800张图像并分析语法性别的影响。

Result: 语法性别显著影响图像生成：阳性语法标记使男性表现增至73%，阴性标记使女性表现增至38%。

Conclusion: 语言结构本身（不仅是内容）影响AI视觉输出，为多语言多模态系统的偏见与公平性研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: Research on bias in Text-to-Image (T2I) models has primarily focused on
demographic representation and stereotypical attributes, overlooking a
fundamental question: how does grammatical gender influence visual
representation across languages? We introduce a cross-linguistic benchmark
examining words where grammatical gender contradicts stereotypical gender
associations (e.g., ``une sentinelle'' - grammatically feminine in French but
referring to the stereotypically masculine concept ``guard''). Our dataset
spans five gendered languages (French, Spanish, German, Italian, Russian) and
two gender-neutral control languages (English, Chinese), comprising 800 unique
prompts that generated 28,800 images across three state-of-the-art T2I models.
Our analysis reveals that grammatical gender dramatically influences image
generation: masculine grammatical markers increase male representation to 73\%
on average (compared to 22\% with gender-neutral English), while feminine
grammatical markers increase female representation to 38\% (compared to 28\% in
English). These effects vary systematically by language resource availability
and model architecture, with high-resource languages showing stronger effects.
Our findings establish that language structure itself, not just content, shapes
AI-generated visual outputs, introducing a new dimension for understanding bias
and fairness in multilingual, multimodal systems.

Abstract: Privacy is a fundamental human right. Data privacy is protected by different
regulations, such as GDPR. However, modern large language models require a huge
amount of data to learn linguistic variations, and the data often contains
private information. Research has shown that it is possible to extract private
information from such language models. Thus, anonymizing such private and
sensitive information is of utmost importance. While complete anonymization may
not be possible, a number of different pre-processing approaches exist for
masking or pseudonymizing private information in textual data. This report
focuses on a few of such approaches for domain-agnostic NLP tasks.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了结构探针的局限性，并提供了受控基准以改进其评估。

Abstract: The syntactic structures of sentences can be readily read-out from the
activations of large language models (LLMs). However, the ``structural probes''
that have been developed to reveal this phenomenon are typically evaluated on
an indiscriminate set of sentences. Consequently, it remains unclear whether
structural and/or statistical factors systematically affect these syntactic
representations. To address this issue, we conduct an in-depth analysis of
structural probes on three controlled benchmarks. Our results are three-fold.
First, structural probes are biased by a superficial property: the closer two
words are in a sentence, the more likely structural probes will consider them
as syntactically linked. Second, structural probes are challenged by linguistic
properties: they poorly represent deep syntactic structures, and get interfered
by interacting nouns or ungrammatical verb forms. Third, structural probes do
not appear to be affected by the predictability of individual words. Overall,
this work sheds light on the current challenges faced by structural probes.

Motivation: 探讨LLM是否能复现东西方文化中抑郁症状报告的差异，以评估其在心理健康应用中的文化敏感性。

Method: 通过用西方或东方角色提示LLM，观察其在不同语言（英语、中文、日语、印地语）下的症状报告模式。

Result: LLM在英语提示下未能复现文化差异，但在东方语言提示下部分改善；模型对文化角色的敏感性低，且存在文化不变的症状层级。

Conclusion: 当前通用LLM缺乏文化感知能力，提示语言虽重要，但仍不足以支持安全有效的心理健康应用。

Abstract: Prior clinical psychology research shows that Western individuals with
depression tend to report psychological symptoms, while Eastern individuals
report somatic ones. We test whether Large Language Models (LLMs), which are
increasingly used in mental health, reproduce these cultural patterns by
prompting them with Western or Eastern personas. Results show that LLMs largely
fail to replicate the patterns when prompted in English, though prompting in
major Eastern languages (i.e., Chinese, Japanese, and Hindi) improves alignment
in several configurations. Our analysis pinpoints two key reasons for this
failure: the models' low sensitivity to cultural personas and a strong,
culturally invariant symptom hierarchy that overrides cultural cues. These
findings reveal that while prompt language is important, current
general-purpose LLMs lack the robust, culture-aware capabilities essential for
safe and effective mental health applications.

Motivation: 政治辩论和讨论的复杂性使得通用预训练语言模型难以有效分析，需要专门的方法来支持公民政治审议。

Method: 在大型政治辩论和演讲语料库上预训练RooseBERT，并在四个下游任务（命名实体识别、情感分析、论证组件检测与分类、论证关系预测与分类）上进行微调。

Result: RooseBERT在四个任务上显著优于通用语言模型，证明了领域特定预训练的有效性。

Conclusion: RooseBERT为政治辩论分析提供了高效工具，并已向研究社区开放。

Abstract: The increasing amount of political debates and politics-related discussions
calls for the definition of novel computational methods to automatically
analyse such content with the final goal of lightening up political
deliberation to citizens. However, the specificity of the political language
and the argumentative form of these debates (employing hidden communication
strategies and leveraging implicit arguments) make this task very challenging,
even for current general-purpose pre-trained Language Models. To address this
issue, we introduce a novel pre-trained Language Model for political discourse
language called RooseBERT. Pre-training a language model on a specialised
domain presents different technical and linguistic challenges, requiring
extensive computational resources and large-scale data. RooseBERT has been
trained on large political debate and speech corpora (8K debates, each composed
of several sub-debates on different topics) in English. To evaluate its
performances, we fine-tuned it on four downstream tasks related to political
debate analysis, i.e., named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, argument
component detection and classification, and argument relation prediction and
classification. Our results demonstrate significant improvements over
general-purpose Language Models on these four tasks, highlighting how
domain-specific pre-training enhances performance in political debate analysis.
We release the RooseBERT language model for the research community.

Motivation: 传统CNER方法主要依赖知识蒸馏（KD）来防止灾难性遗忘，但过度强调稳定性而牺牲了可塑性。

Method: 从表示视角引入池化操作增强可塑性，从权重视角动态合并新旧模型权重，并采用权重引导的选择机制和基于置信度的伪标签方法处理非实体类型的语义偏移。

Result: 在三个基准数据集的十个CNER设置上，SPT方法优于现有方法，实现了更好的稳定性与可塑性平衡。

Conclusion: SPT方法有效解决了CNER中的稳定性与可塑性权衡问题，为持续学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Continual Named Entity Recognition (CNER) is an evolving field that focuses
on sequentially updating an existing model to incorporate new entity types.
Previous CNER methods primarily utilize Knowledge Distillation (KD) to preserve
prior knowledge and overcome catastrophic forgetting, strictly ensuring that
the representations of old and new models remain consistent. Consequently, they
often impart the model with excessive stability (i.e., retention of old
knowledge) but limited plasticity (i.e., acquisition of new knowledge). To
address this issue, we propose a Stability-Plasticity Trade-off (SPT) method
for CNER that balances these aspects from both representation and weight
perspectives. From the representation perspective, we introduce a pooling
operation into the original KD, permitting a level of plasticity by
consolidating representation dimensions. From the weight perspective, we
dynamically merge the weights of old and new models, strengthening old
knowledge while maintaining new knowledge. During this fusion, we implement a
weight-guided selective mechanism to prioritize significant weights. Moreover,
we develop a confidence-based pseudo-labeling approach for the current
non-entity type, which predicts entity types using the old model to handle the
semantic shift of the non-entity type, a challenge specific to CNER that has
largely been ignored by previous methods. Extensive experiments across ten CNER
settings on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our SPT method surpasses
previous CNER approaches, highlighting its effectiveness in achieving a
suitable stability-plasticity trade-off.

TL;DR: 研究评估了大型语言模型（LLMs）在预测真实人类经济决策中的能力，发现其在个体层面预测表现有限，但在群体层面能反映行为趋势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs是否能用真实人类数据模拟经济行为，弥补现有研究依赖虚构角色的不足。

Method: 通过522名韩国参与者的文化消费场景数据，比较三种多模态LLMs的表现，并分析不同提示方法的效果。

Result: LLMs在个体层面预测不准确，但能反映群体行为趋势；复杂提示方法未显著优于简单方法。

Conclusion: 研究为计算社会科学中基于角色的模拟提供了实证指导，首次全面评估了LLMs在真实人类数据上的经济行为模拟能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have generated significant
interest in their capacity to simulate human-like behaviors, yet most studies
rely on fictional personas rather than actual human data. We address this
limitation by evaluating LLMs' ability to predict individual economic
decision-making using Pay-What-You-Want (PWYW) pricing experiments with real
522 human personas. Our study systematically compares three state-of-the-art
multimodal LLMs using detailed persona information from 522 Korean participants
in cultural consumption scenarios. We investigate whether LLMs can accurately
replicate individual human choices and how persona injection methods affect
prediction performance. Results reveal that while LLMs struggle with precise
individual-level predictions, they demonstrate reasonable group-level
behavioral tendencies. Also, we found that commonly adopted prompting
techniques are not much better than naive prompting methods; reconstruction of
personal narrative nor retrieval augmented generation have no significant gain
against simple prompting method. We believe that these findings can provide the
first comprehensive evaluation of LLMs' capabilities on simulating economic
behavior using real human data, offering empirical guidance for persona-based
simulation in computational social science.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有间隔重复系统在语义干扰和个性化适应方面表现不足，特别是在语言考试等测试导向场景中。

Method: LECTOR结合大型语言模型进行语义分析，并整合个性化学习档案，优化间隔重复调度。

Result: 在100天的模拟学习中，LECTOR以90.2%的成功率优于最佳基线算法（88.4%），尤其在处理语义相似概念时表现突出。

Conclusion: LECTOR为智能辅导系统和自适应学习平台提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Spaced repetition systems are fundamental to efficient learning and memory
retention, but existing algorithms often struggle with semantic interference
and personalized adaptation. We present LECTOR (\textbf{L}LM-\textbf{E}nhanced
\textbf{C}oncept-based \textbf{T}est-\textbf{O}riented \textbf{R}epetition), a
novel adaptive scheduling algorithm specifically designed for test-oriented
learning scenarios, particularly language examinations where success rate is
paramount. LECTOR leverages large language models for semantic analysis while
incorporating personalized learning profiles, addressing the critical challenge
of semantic confusion in vocabulary learning by utilizing LLM-powered semantic
similarity assessment and integrating it with established spaced repetition
principles. Our comprehensive evaluation against six baseline algorithms
(SSP-MMC, SM2, HLR, FSRS, ANKI, THRESHOLD) across 100 simulated learners over
100 days demonstrates significant improvements: LECTOR achieves a 90.2\%
success rate compared to 88.4\% for the best baseline (SSP-MMC), representing a
2.0\% relative improvement. The algorithm shows particular strength in handling
semantically similar concepts, reducing confusion-induced errors while
maintaining computational efficiency. Our results establish LECTOR as a
promising direction for intelligent tutoring systems and adaptive learning
platforms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在语言使用上与人类的相似性，特别是是否表现出语言趋同这一人类语言交流的核心语用特征。

Method: 通过比较16种语言模型、3个对话语料库和多种风格特征，系统分析模型补全对话与原始人类回复的差异。

Result: 模型强烈趋同于对话风格，但往往过度适应；指令调优和更大模型的趋同程度低于预训练模型。

Conclusion: 模型与人类的语言趋同机制可能不同，需进一步研究其底层机制。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) are generally considered proficient in
generating language, how similar their language usage is to that of humans
remains understudied. In this paper, we test whether models exhibit linguistic
convergence, a core pragmatic element of human language communication, asking:
do models adapt, or converge, to the linguistic patterns of their user? To
answer this, we systematically compare model completions of exisiting dialogues
to the original human responses across sixteen language models, three dialogue
corpora, and a variety of stylometric features. We find that models strongly
converge to the conversation's style, often significantly overfitting relative
to the human baseline. While convergence patterns are often feature-specific,
we observe consistent shifts in convergence across modeling settings, with
instruction-tuned and larger models converging less than their pretrained
counterparts. Given the differences between human and model convergence
patterns, we hypothesize that the underlying mechanisms for these behaviors are
very different.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在开放式叙事生成任务中表现出的性别偏见，发现模型在无条件提示下偏向男性，但通过独立于性别刻板印象的属性可以缓解偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs广泛应用，其可能放大性别偏见的问题日益受到关注。现有研究多关注显性偏见，而忽略了生成内容中的隐性偏见。

Method: 使用心理学中的性别刻板印象（如攻击性或八卦）构建数据集StereoBias-Stories，分析模型在叙事生成中的性别偏见。

Result: 发现模型在无条件提示下偏向男性；独立属性可缓解偏见；多属性组合会强化刻板印象；模型偏见与心理学分类一致。

Conclusion: 强调基于心理学的LLMs评估的重要性，揭示了隐性偏见的复杂性。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used across different
applications, concerns about their potential to amplify gender biases in
various tasks are rising. Prior research has often probed gender bias using
explicit gender cues as counterfactual, or studied them in sentence completion
and short question answering tasks. These formats might overlook more implicit
forms of bias embedded in generative behavior of longer content. In this work,
we investigate gender bias in LLMs using gender stereotypes studied in
psychology (e.g., aggressiveness or gossiping) in an open-ended task of
narrative generation. We introduce a novel dataset called StereoBias-Stories
containing short stories either unconditioned or conditioned on (one, two, or
six) random attributes from 25 psychological stereotypes and three task-related
story endings. We analyze how the gender contribution in the overall story
changes in response to these attributes and present three key findings: (1)
While models, on average, are highly biased towards male in unconditioned
prompts, conditioning on attributes independent from gender stereotypes
mitigates this bias. (2) Combining multiple attributes associated with the same
gender stereotype intensifies model behavior, with male ones amplifying bias
and female ones alleviating it. (3) Model biases align with psychological
ground-truth used for categorization, and alignment strength increases with
model size. Together, these insights highlight the importance of
psychology-grounded evaluation of LLMs.

Result: LLM表现优于教授，监督学习结合LLM不确定性效果最好。

Conclusion: LLM不确定性结合监督学习可帮助教授更准确评估考题难度，提升考试质量。

Abstract: Estimating the difficulty of exam questions is essential for developing good
exams, but professors are not always good at this task. We compare various
Large Language Model-based methods with three professors in their ability to
estimate what percentage of students will give correct answers on True/False
exam questions in the areas of Neural Networks and Machine Learning. Our
results show that the professors have limited ability to distinguish between
easy and difficult questions and that they are outperformed by directly asking
Gemini 2.5 to solve this task. Yet, we obtained even better results using
uncertainties of the LLMs solving the questions in a supervised learning
setting, using only 42 training samples. We conclude that supervised learning
using LLM uncertainty can help professors better estimate the difficulty of
exam questions, improving the quality of assessment.

Motivation: 现有内容审核方法依赖噪声标签学习，缺乏与审核规则的对齐，且决策不透明，难以支持人工审核。

Method: Hi-Guard采用分层审核流程和分层分类法，结合规则定义和多级软边际奖励优化，使用GRPO进行训练。

Result: 实验和实际部署表明，Hi-Guard在分类准确性、泛化能力和可解释性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: Hi-Guard为可扩展、透明且可信的内容安全系统提供了新方向。

Abstract: Social platforms have revolutionized information sharing, but also
accelerated the dissemination of harmful and policy-violating content. To
ensure safety and compliance at scale, moderation systems must go beyond
efficiency and offer accuracy and interpretability. However, current approaches
largely rely on noisy, label-driven learning, lacking alignment with moderation
rules and producing opaque decisions that hinder human review. Therefore, we
propose Hierarchical Guard (Hi-Guard), a multimodal moderation framework that
introduces a new policy-aligned decision paradigm. The term "Hierarchical"
reflects two key aspects of our system design: (1) a hierarchical moderation
pipeline, where a lightweight binary model first filters safe content and a
stronger model handles fine-grained risk classification; and (2) a hierarchical
taxonomy in the second stage, where the model performs path-based
classification over a hierarchical taxonomy ranging from coarse to fine-grained
levels. To ensure alignment with evolving moderation policies, Hi-Guard
directly incorporates rule definitions into the model prompt. To further
enhance structured prediction and reasoning, we introduce a multi-level
soft-margin reward and optimize with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO),
penalizing semantically adjacent misclassifications and improving explanation
quality. Extensive experiments and real-world deployment demonstrate that
Hi-Guard achieves superior classification accuracy, generalization, and
interpretability, paving the way toward scalable, transparent, and trustworthy
content safety systems. Code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时间缩放方法（如Best-of-N和Self-Consistency）受限于单代理与单奖励模型的交互（SA-SR），无法突破单代理系统的上限。集体代理方法展示了通过多样化模型协作突破这一限制的潜力。

Method: 设计了三种CTTS范式（SA-MR、MA-SR、MA-MR），并验证MA-MR性能最佳。基于此，提出CTTS-MM框架，包括代理协作搜索（ACS）和奖励模型混合（MoR）方法。

Result: 在七个主流基准测试中，CTTS-MM表现最优。

Conclusion: 集体测试时间缩放（CTTS）和多代理多奖励模型协作（MA-MR）能显著提升模型性能，CTTS-MM为未来研究提供了有效框架。

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) has emerged as a promising research field for
enhancing the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) without extra
training. However, most existing approaches, e.g., Best-of-N and
Self-Consistency rely on a single agent interacting with a reward model
(SA-SR), constrained by limited capabilities of a single test-time scaling
(STTS) paradigm. On the other hand, recent works demonstrate that
collective-agent methods can break through the upper bound of single-agent
systems by orchestrating diverse models. Thus, in this paper, we take a first
step towards exploring Collective Test-Time Scaling (CTTS). Consider the
different interaction types of single and multiple models, we design three
primary paradigms to investigate the optimal paradigm of CTTS: (1) single agent
to multiple reward models (SA-MR); (2) multiple agents to single reward model
(MA-SR); and (3) multiple agents to multiple reward models (MA-MR). Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MA-MR consistently achieves the best performance.
Based on this, we propose a novel framework named CTTS-MM that effectively
leverages both multi-agent and multi-reward-model collaboration for enhanced
inference. Specifically, for multi-agent collaboration, we propose an Agent
Collaboration Search (ACS), which searches for the most effective combination
of LLM agents from a large candidate pool; for multi-reward-model
collaboration, we propose Mixture of Reword Models (MoR), which consists of a
curated question pool and a Prior Reward model Ensemble Selection (PRES) to
select the optimal combinations of reward models via Pair-wise Reward Ranking
(PRR) metric. Experiments across seven mainstream benchmarks demonstrate that
the proposed CTTS-MM consistently obtains superior performance. Code will be
released at https://github.com/magent4aci/CTTS-MM.

Motivation: 现有NLP方法在构建角色社交网络时表现不佳，尤其是在低资源语言中，缺乏标注数据。

Method: 结合POS标注和启发式方法，提出Taggus管道。

Result: Taggus在角色识别和交互检测中的F1分数分别为94.1%和75.9%，显著优于现有工具。

Conclusion: Taggus为葡萄牙语文学分析提供了有效工具，未来可改进角色关系检测。

Abstract: Automatically identifying characters and their interactions from fiction
books is, arguably, a complex task that requires pipelines that leverage
multiple Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods, such as Named Entity
Recognition (NER) and Part-of-speech (POS) tagging. However, these methods are
not optimized for the task that leads to the construction of Social Networks of
Characters. Indeed, the currently available methods tend to underperform,
especially in less-represented languages, due to a lack of manually annotated
data for training. Here, we propose a pipeline, which we call Taggus, to
extract social networks from literary fiction works in Portuguese. Our results
show that compared to readily available State-of-the-Art tools -- off-the-shelf
NER tools and Large Language Models (ChatGPT) -- the resulting pipeline, which
uses POS tagging and a combination of heuristics, achieves satisfying results
with an average F1-Score of $94.1\%$ in the task of identifying characters and
solving for co-reference and $75.9\%$ in interaction detection. These
represent, respectively, an increase of $50.7\%$ and $22.3\%$ on results
achieved by the readily available State-of-the-Art tools. Further steps to
improve results are outlined, such as solutions for detecting relationships
between characters. Limitations on the size and scope of our testing samples
are acknowledged. The Taggus pipeline is publicly available to encourage
development in this field for the Portuguese language.2

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为JointThinking的新ICL范式，通过结合Thinking和Nothinking两种推理模式的差异来提高推理准确性，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注RLLMs的训练和推理策略，但其在上下文学习（ICL）中的潜力尚未充分探索。

Method: 通过并行生成Thinking和Nothinking模式的答案，仅在答案不一致时触发第二轮推理，以减少延迟开销。

Result: 在多个推理基准测试中显著优于few-shot CoT和多数投票，且在分布外任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: JointThinking展示了结构思维多样性的价值，并具有强扩展性，为未来ICL研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Reasoning large language models (RLLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable
capabilities through structured and multi-step reasoning. While prior research
has primarily focused on improving their training and inference strategies,
their potential for in-context learning (ICL) remains largely underexplored. To
fill this gap, we propose Thinking with Nothinking Calibration (JointThinking),
a new ICL paradigm that leverages the structured difference between two
reasoning modes, i.e., Thinking and Nothinking, to improve reasoning accuracy.
Specifically, our method prompts the model to generate two answers in parallel:
one in Thinking mode and the other in Nothinking mode. A second round of
Thinking is triggered only when the two initial responses are inconsistent,
using a single prompt that incorporates the original question and both
candidate answers. Since such disagreement occurs infrequently (e.g., only 6\%
in GSM8K), our method performs just one round of reasoning in most cases,
resulting in minimal latency overhead. Extensive experiments across multiple
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that JointThinking significantly outperforms
few-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) and majority voting with improved answer
robustness. Moreover, It achieves comparable in-distribution performance to
training-based SOTA method, while substantially outperforming on
out-of-distribution tasks. We further conduct a systematic analysis of the
calibration mechanism, showing that leveraging different reasoning modes
consistently lowers the error rate and highlights the value of structural
thinking diversity. Additionally, we observe that the performance gap between
actual and ideal reasoning narrows as model size increases in the second round
of thinking, indicating the strong scalability of our approach. Finally, we
discuss current limitations and outline promising directions for future ICL
research in RLLMs.

Motivation: 传统抑郁症诊断存在临床访问障碍和社会污名，而现有计算方法缺乏与DSM-5标准的直接关联。

Method: 构建了包含1484篇长帖的ReDSM5语料库，每句由心理学家标注DSM-5症状并提供临床解释。

Result: 分析了语言模式，建立了症状分类和解释生成的基线基准。

Conclusion: ReDSM5结合症状标注和专家解释，提升了抑郁症检测的临床相关性和可解释性。

Abstract: Depression is a pervasive mental health condition that affects hundreds of
millions of individuals worldwide, yet many cases remain undiagnosed due to
barriers in traditional clinical access and pervasive stigma. Social media
platforms, and Reddit in particular, offer rich, user-generated narratives that
can reveal early signs of depressive symptomatology. However, existing
computational approaches often label entire posts simply as depressed or not
depressed, without linking language to specific criteria from the DSM-5, the
standard clinical framework for diagnosing depression. This limits both
clinical relevance and interpretability. To address this gap, we introduce
ReDSM5, a novel Reddit corpus comprising 1484 long-form posts, each
exhaustively annotated at the sentence level by a licensed psychologist for the
nine DSM-5 depression symptoms. For each label, the annotator also provides a
concise clinical rationale grounded in DSM-5 methodology. We conduct an
exploratory analysis of the collection, examining lexical, syntactic, and
emotional patterns that characterize symptom expression in social media
narratives. Compared to prior resources, ReDSM5 uniquely combines
symptom-specific supervision with expert explanations, facilitating the
development of models that not only detect depression but also generate
human-interpretable reasoning. We establish baseline benchmarks for both
multi-label symptom classification and explanation generation, providing
reference results for future research on detection and interpretability.

Result: 在两种流行数据集上的实验表明，MISDER优于多种基线方法。

Conclusion: MISDER框架有效解决了虚假信息检测中的动态环境问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The proliferation of misinformation across diverse social media platforms has
drawn significant attention from both academic and industrial communities due
to its detrimental effects. Accordingly, automatically distinguishing
misinformation, dubbed as Misinformation Detection (MD), has become an
increasingly active research topic. The mainstream methods formulate MD as a
static learning paradigm, which learns the mapping between the content, links,
and propagation of news articles and the corresponding manual veracity labels.
However, the static assumption is often violated, since in real-world
scenarios, the veracity of news articles may vacillate within the dynamically
evolving social environment. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel
framework, namely Misinformation detection with Dynamic Environmental
Representations (MISDER). The basic idea of MISDER lies in learning a social
environmental representation for each period and employing a temporal model to
predict the representation for future periods. In this work, we specify the
temporal model as the LSTM model, continuous dynamics equation, and pre-trained
dynamics system, suggesting three variants of MISDER, namely MISDER-LSTM,
MISDER-ODE, and MISDER-PT, respectively. To evaluate the performance of MISDER,
we compare it to various MD baselines across 2 prevalent datasets, and the
experimental results can indicate the effectiveness of our proposed model.

Conclusion: 通过随机性策略（如Gumbel-Softmax）可以优化软思考能力，提升LLMs在多样化推理路径上的表现。

Abstract: Human cognition naturally engages with abstract and fluid concepts, whereas
existing reasoning models often rely on generating discrete tokens, potentially
constraining their expressive capabilities. Recent advancements aim to address
this limitation by enabling large language models (LLMs) to generate soft,
abstract tokens, thus facilitating reasoning within a continuous concept space.
This paper explores the `Soft Thinking' capabilities of various LLMs by
examining the models' internal behavior using a suite of probing techniques.
Contrary to the common belief that Soft Thinking enables the simultaneous
exploration of diverse reasoning paths, our findings reveal that LLMs
predominantly rely on the most influential component of the soft inputs during
subsequent decoding steps. This reliance hinders the exploration of different
reasoning paths and reduces vanilla Soft Thinking to a form of greedy decoding,
obscuring the advantage of transmitting more information through Soft Tokens.
To tackle this issue, we explore sampling strategies to introduce
\emph{randomness}, employing methods such as Dirichlet resampling and the
Gumbel-Softmax trick. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating randomness
can alleviate the limitations of vanilla approaches and unleash the potential
of Soft Thinking. Notably, the Gumbel-Softmax trick provides adequate
randomness with controlled smoothness, resulting in superior performance across
eight reasoning benchmarks.

Result: 裁剪增强表现更优；领域外数据质量低于监督SOTA，领域内数据接近；微调后层嵌入质量更高。

Conclusion: 自监督微调在领域内数据上高效且接近监督SOTA，后层微调足够。

Abstract: Text embeddings, i.e. vector representations of entire texts, play an
important role in many NLP applications, such as retrieval-augmented
generation, sentiment analysis, clustering, or visualizing collections of texts
for data exploration. Currently, top-performing embedding models are derived
from pre-trained language models via extensive supervised fine-tuning using
curated text pairs. This contrasts with computer vision, where self-supervised
training based on data augmentations has demonstrated remarkable success. Here
we systematically compare the two most well-known augmentation strategies for
positive pair generation in contrastive learning of text embeddings. We assess
embedding quality on MTEB and additional in-domain evaluations and show that
cropping augmentation strongly outperforms the dropout-based approach. We find
that on out-of-domain data, the quality of resulting embeddings is below the
supervised SOTA models, but for in-domain data, self-supervised fine-tuning
produces high-quality text embeddings after very short fine-tuning, sometimes
only marginally below the supervised SOTA. Finally, we show that representation
quality increases towards the last transformer layers, which undergo the
largest change during fine-tuning; and that fine-tuning only those last layers
is sufficient to reach similar embedding quality.

Abstract: Product sustainability reports provide valuable insights into the
environmental impacts of a product and are often distributed in PDF format.
These reports often include a combination of tables and text, which complicates
their analysis. The lack of standardization and the variability in reporting
formats further exacerbate the difficulty of extracting and interpreting
relevant information from large volumes of documents. In this paper, we tackle
the challenge of answering questions related to carbon footprints within
sustainability reports available in PDF format. Unlike previous approaches, our
focus is on addressing the difficulties posed by the unstructured and
inconsistent nature of text extracted from PDF parsing. To facilitate this
analysis, we introduce CarbonPDF-QA, an open-source dataset containing
question-answer pairs for 1735 product report documents, along with
human-annotated answers. Our analysis shows that GPT-4o struggles to answer
questions with data inconsistencies. To address this limitation, we propose
CarbonPDF, an LLM-based technique specifically designed to answer carbon
footprint questions on such datasets. We develop CarbonPDF by fine-tuning Llama
3 with our training data. Our results show that our technique outperforms
current state-of-the-art techniques, including question-answering (QA) systems
finetuned on table and text data.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: UPLME是一个不确定性感知的概率语言建模框架，用于在共情检测的回归设置中捕捉标签噪声，通过贝叶斯概念和变分模型集成训练，并在两个公共基准测试中取得最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督学习在共情回归中面临自报告共情分数噪声的挑战，回归问题中的噪声标签学习相对较少被探索。

Method: UPLME包括一个预测共情分数和异方差不确定性的概率语言模型，通过贝叶斯概念和变分模型集成训练，并引入两个新的损失组件。

Result: UPLME在两个有标签噪声的公共基准测试中取得最佳性能（Pearson相关系数提升），并通过合成噪声注入实验验证其有效性。

Conclusion: UPLME在共情检测的回归问题中表现出色，能有效分离噪声和干净样本，并优于其他不确定性量化方法。

Abstract: Supervised learning for empathy regression is challenged by noisy
self-reported empathy scores. While many algorithms have been proposed for
learning with noisy labels in textual classification problems, the regression
counterpart is relatively under-explored. We propose UPLME, an
uncertainty-aware probabilistic language modelling framework to capture label
noise in the regression setting of empathy detection. UPLME includes a
probabilistic language model that predicts both empathy score and
heteroscedastic uncertainty and is trained using Bayesian concepts with
variational model ensembling. We further introduce two novel loss components:
one penalises degenerate Uncertainty Quantification (UQ), and another enforces
the similarity between the input pairs on which we predict empathy. UPLME
provides state-of-the-art performance (Pearson Correlation Coefficient:
$0.558\rightarrow0.580$ and $0.629\rightarrow0.634$) in terms of the
performance reported in the literature in two public benchmarks, having label
noise. Through synthetic label noise injection, we show that UPLME is effective
in separating noisy and clean samples based on the predicted uncertainty. UPLME
further outperform (Calibration error: $0.571\rightarrow0.376$) a recent
variational model ensembling-based UQ method designed for regression problems.

*Lester James V. Miranda,Elyanah Aco,Conner Manuel,Jan Christian Blaise Cruz,Joseph Marvin Imperial*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FilBench是一个针对菲律宾语言（如菲律宾语、他加禄语和宿务语）的基准测试，用于评估LLM在多种任务中的表现。研究发现，即使是表现最好的GPT-4o也仅达到72.23%的分数，表明菲律宾语言的LLM评估仍具挑战性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在英语任务中表现优异，但对其在菲律宾语言中的能力知之甚少。FilBench旨在填补这一空白，推动菲律宾语言的NLP研究。

Method: 通过FilBench评估27种最先进的LLM，涵盖文化知识、传统NLP、阅读理解和生成等任务。

Result: 结果显示，LLM在阅读理解和翻译任务上表现不佳，且专门针对东南亚语言的模型表现更差。

Conclusion: FilBench突显了语言特定基准测试的重要性，有助于推动菲律宾语言的LLM发展。

Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of LLMs on English-based tasks, little is
known about their capabilities in specific languages such as Filipino. In this
work, we address this gap by introducing FilBench, a Filipino-centric benchmark
designed to evaluate LLMs across a diverse set of tasks and capabilities in
Filipino, Tagalog, and Cebuano. We carefully curate the tasks in FilBench to
reflect the priorities and trends of NLP research in the Philippines such as
Cultural Knowledge, Classical NLP, Reading Comprehension, and Generation. By
evaluating 27 state-of-the-art LLMs on FilBench, we find that several LLMs
suffer from reading comprehension and translation capabilities. Our results
indicate that FilBench is challenging, with the best model, GPT-4o, achieving
only a score of 72.23%. Moreover, we also find that models trained specifically
for Southeast Asian languages tend to underperform on FilBench, with the
highest-performing model, SEA-LION v3 70B, achieving only a score of 61.07%.
Our work demonstrates the value of curating language-specific LLM benchmarks to
aid in driving progress on Filipino NLP and increasing the inclusion of
Philippine languages in LLM development.

Motivation: 南非官方语言的术语数据分散且非机器可读，阻碍多语言NLP发展。

Method: 系统整合、清理并标准化术语数据，构建开放、互操作的Marito数据集，并应用于RAG管道。

Result: 显著提升英语到Tshivenda机器翻译的准确性和领域一致性。

Conclusion: Marito为开发公平、强大的NLP技术提供了可扩展基础，支持南非语言多样性。

Abstract: The critical lack of structured terminological data for South Africa's
official languages hampers progress in multilingual NLP, despite the existence
of numerous government and academic terminology lists. These valuable assets
remain fragmented and locked in non-machine-readable formats, rendering them
unusable for computational research and development. \emph{Marito} addresses
this challenge by systematically aggregating, cleaning, and standardising these
scattered resources into open, interoperable datasets. We introduce the
foundational \emph{Marito} dataset, released under the equitable,
Africa-centered NOODL framework. To demonstrate its immediate utility, we
integrate the terminology into a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline.
Experiments show substantial improvements in the accuracy and domain-specific
consistency of English-to-Tshivenda machine translation for large language
models. \emph{Marito} provides a scalable foundation for developing robust and
equitable NLP technologies, ensuring South Africa's rich linguistic diversity
is represented in the digital age.

TL;DR: EmbedGrad通过梯度优化文本提示嵌入，解决了离散提示工程和连续参数调整的局限性，显著提升了任务适应能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI部署中，预训练模型的适应性仍面临挑战，离散提示工程和连续参数调整各有不足。

Method: 提出EmbedGrad框架，通过梯度优化文本提示嵌入，分离训练与部署阶段，实现精细校准。

Result: 在数学推理、情感分析和因果判断任务中，EmbedGrad显著提升性能，如数学问题准确率从14.74%提升至58.96%。

Conclusion: EmbedGrad为任务适应提供了新范式，结合了提示工程和参数效率的优势。

Abstract: Effectively adapting powerful pretrained foundation models to diverse tasks
remains a key challenge in AI deployment. Current approaches primarily follow
two paradigms:discrete optimization of text prompts through prompt engineering,
or continuous adaptation via additional trainable parameters. Both exhibit
limitations-discrete methods lack refinement precision while parameter-based
techniques increase complexity and reduce interpretability. To address these
constraints, we propose EmbedGrad, a novel framework that optimizes text prompt
embeddings through gradient-based refinement. Our approach uniquely decouples
training from deployment:during optimization,labeled examples guide precise
embedding adjustments while preserving semantic meaning; during inference, only
optimized embeddings integrate with user queries. This enables fine-grained
calibration impossible in text space, such as enhancing the reasoning
capability of prompts like please reason step by step. Comprehensive
evaluations across mathematical reasoning, sentiment analysis, and causal
judgment tasks demonstrate EmbedGrad's effectiveness:optimizing this reasoning
prompt for Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B increased accuracy from 14.74\% to 58.96\% on
mathematical problems. Consistent improvements were observed across model
scales (0.5B-14B) and all tasks, with particularly significant gains for
smaller models on complex problems like causal judgment. By bridging prompt
engineering and parameter efficiency without architectural changes, our work
establishes embedding refinement as a powerful new paradigm for task
adaptation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LAGER是一个轻量级框架，通过聚合大语言模型（LLM）中间层的表示来提升其作为评估工具（LLM-as-a-judge）与人类评分的对齐性，无需复杂提示或微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM作为评估工具的对齐性提升依赖复杂提示或微调，而研究发现中间层表示更符合人类判断，因此提出LAGER框架。

Method: LAGER通过聚合跨层分数标记逻辑和基于softmax分布的期望分数生成细粒度评分，保持LLM主干冻结。

Result: 在Flask、HelpSteer和BIGGen基准测试中，LAGER比最佳基线提升7.5%，且在推理步骤较少的情况下优于基于推理的方法。

Conclusion: LAGER通过利用中间层表示有效提升了LLM作为评估工具的对齐性，适用于多种下游任务。

Abstract: The growing scale of evaluation tasks has led to the widespread adoption of
automated evaluation using large language models, a paradigm known as
"LLMas-a-judge." However, improving its alignment with human preferences
without complex prompts or fine-tuning remains challenging. In this work,
motivated by preliminary findings that middle-to-upper layers encode
semantically and taskrelevant representations that are often more aligned with
human judgments than the final layer, we propose LAGER, a lightweight and
efficient framework for enhancing LLM-as-a-Judge alignment with human scoring,
via internal representations. LAGER produces fine-grained judgment scores by
aggregating cross-layer scoretoken logits and computing the expected score from
a softmax-based distribution, with the LLM backbone kept frozen. LAGER fully
leverages the complementary information across different layers, overcoming the
limitations of relying solely on the final layer. We evaluate our method on the
standard alignment benchmarks Flask, HelpSteer, and BIGGen using Spearman
correlation, and find that LAGER achieves improvements of up to 7.5% over the
best baseline across these benchmarks. Without reasoning steps, LAGER matches
or outperforms reasoning-based methods. Experiments on downstream applications,
such as data selection and emotional understanding, further show the
effectiveness of our method.

Motivation: 大语言模型在领域迁移时性能下降，主要由于灾难性遗忘问题。

Method: 提出KILO框架，利用检索的领域知识指导训练，结合动态知识图谱和指令调优。

Result: 在四个目标领域的实验中，KILO在多项指标上优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 结合结构化知识检索和指令提示能有效解决持续学习中的领域迁移问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often suffer from performance degradation when
faced with domain shifts, primarily due to catastrophic forgetting. In this
work, we propose KILO (Knowledge-Instructed Learning for Continual Adaptation),
a novel continual learning framework that integrates dynamic knowledge graphs
with instruction tuning. By leveraging retrieved domain-specific knowledge as
guidance during training, KILO enhances both adaptability to new domains and
retention of previously acquired knowledge. We pretrain our model on
WikiText-103 and evaluate sequential adaptation across four diverse target
domains: BioASQ, SciQ, TweetEval, and MIND. Our experiments demonstrate that
KILO consistently outperforms strong baselines, including continual
fine-tuning, ERNIE 2.0, and CPT, in terms of backward transfer, forward
transfer, F1 score, retention rate, and training efficiency. These results
highlight the effectiveness of combining structured knowledge retrieval and
instruction prompting to overcome domain shift challenges in continual learning
scenarios.

Motivation: 现有基准对文档RAG系统的评估不全面，使用合成数据且缺乏完整标注，无法反映真实挑战。

Method: 引入Double-Bench，包含3,276份文档和5,168个查询，支持动态更新，并由专家验证证据。

Result: 实验显示文本和视觉嵌入模型的差距缩小，但现有框架存在过度自信问题。

Conclusion: Double-Bench为未来文档RAG研究提供了严格基础，并计划每年更新基准。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems using Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) show great promise for complex document understanding, yet their
development is critically hampered by inadequate evaluation. Current benchmarks
often focus on specific part of document RAG system and use synthetic data with
incomplete ground truth and evidence labels, therefore failing to reflect
real-world bottlenecks and challenges. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce Double-Bench: a new large-scale, multilingual, and multimodal
evaluation system that is able to produce fine-grained assessment to each
component within document RAG systems. It comprises 3,276 documents (72,880
pages) and 5,168 single- and multi-hop queries across 6 languages and 4
document types with streamlined dynamic update support for potential data
contamination issues. Queries are grounded in exhaustively scanned evidence
pages and verified by human experts to ensure maximum quality and completeness.
Our comprehensive experiments across 9 state-of-the-art embedding models, 4
MLLMs and 4 end-to-end document RAG frameworks demonstrate the gap between text
and visual embedding models is narrowing, highlighting the need in building
stronger document retrieval models. Our findings also reveal the
over-confidence dilemma within current document RAG frameworks that tend to
provide answer even without evidence support. We hope our fully open-source
Double-Bench provide a rigorous foundation for future research in advanced
document RAG systems. We plan to retrieve timely corpus and release new
benchmarks on an annual basis.

Motivation: 讽刺是一种复杂的语言现象，传统方法主要依赖文本，而多模态信息的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出了一种结合深度对象提取和外部概念知识的框架，无需额外训练。

Result: 实验证明该框架在多模态讽刺检测和解释任务中有效。

Conclusion: 该框架解决了LVLMs在MSA中的视觉理解和概念知识不足问题，提升了性能。

Abstract: Sarcasm is a complex linguistic phenomenon that involves a disparity between
literal and intended meanings, making it challenging for sentiment analysis and
other emotion-sensitive tasks. While traditional sarcasm detection methods
primarily focus on text, recent approaches have incorporated multimodal
information. However, the application of Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs)
in Multimodal Sarcasm Analysis (MSA) remains underexplored. In this paper, we
evaluate LVLMs in MSA tasks, specifically focusing on Multimodal Sarcasm
Detection and Multimodal Sarcasm Explanation. Through comprehensive
experiments, we identify key limitations, such as insufficient visual
understanding and a lack of conceptual knowledge. To address these issues, we
propose a training-free framework that integrates in-depth object extraction
and external conceptual knowledge to improve the model's ability to interpret
and explain sarcasm in multimodal contexts. The experimental results on
multiple models show the effectiveness of our proposed framework. The code is
available at https://github.com/cp-cp/LVLM-MSA.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CTR-Sink的新框架，通过引入行为级注意力汇来解决用户行为序列与语言模型预训练之间的结构不匹配问题，从而提升点击率预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户行为序列由离散动作组成，与语言模型预训练的自然语言结构不匹配，导致语义碎片化，影响预测性能。

Method: 提出CTR-Sink框架，插入汇令牌并结合推荐信号（如时间距离）作为注意力汇，设计两阶段训练策略和注意力汇机制。

Result: 在工业数据集和开源数据集（MovieLens、Kuairec）上的实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: CTR-Sink通过行为级注意力汇解决了结构不匹配问题，显著提升了点击率预测性能。

Abstract: Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction, a core task in recommendation systems,
estimates user click likelihood using historical behavioral data. Modeling user
behavior sequences as text to leverage Language Models (LMs) for this task has
gained traction, owing to LMs' strong semantic understanding and contextual
modeling capabilities. However, a critical structural gap exists: user behavior
sequences consist of discrete actions connected by semantically empty
separators, differing fundamentally from the coherent natural language in LM
pre-training. This mismatch causes semantic fragmentation, where LM attention
scatters across irrelevant tokens instead of focusing on meaningful behavior
boundaries and inter-behavior relationships, degrading prediction performance.
To address this, we propose $\textit{CTR-Sink}$, a novel framework introducing
behavior-level attention sinks tailored for recommendation scenarios. Inspired
by attention sink theory, it constructs attention focus sinks and dynamically
regulates attention aggregation via external information. Specifically, we
insert sink tokens between consecutive behaviors, incorporating
recommendation-specific signals such as temporal distance to serve as stable
attention sinks. To enhance generality, we design a two-stage training strategy
that explicitly guides LM attention toward sink tokens and a attention sink
mechanism that amplifies inter-sink dependencies to better capture behavioral
correlations. Experiments on one industrial dataset and two open-source
datasets (MovieLens, Kuairec), alongside visualization results, validate the
method's effectiveness across scenarios.

Result: 提供了集中化的偏见缓解工具，促进公平性技术的广泛应用。

Conclusion: FairLangProc有助于推动自然语言处理中的公平性研究和技术普及。

Abstract: The rise in usage of Large Language Models to near ubiquitousness in recent
years has risen societal concern about their applications in decision-making
contexts, such as organizational justice or healthcare. This, in turn, poses
questions about the fairness of these models in critical settings, which leads
to the developement of different procedures to address bias in Natural Language
Processing. Although many datasets, metrics and algorithms have been proposed
to measure and mitigate harmful prejudice in Natural Language Processing, their
implementation is diverse and far from centralized. As a response, this paper
presents FairLangProc, a comprehensive Python package providing a common
implementation of some of the more recent advances in fairness in Natural
Language Processing providing an interface compatible with the famous Hugging
Face transformers library, aiming to encourage the widespread use and
democratization of bias mitigation techniques. The implementation can be found

Motivation: 探究LLMs在专用基准测试中表现不佳的原因是缺乏领域知识还是提示细节不足。

Method: 引入PartialOrderEval工具，为代码生成基准测试提供从最小到最大细节的提示部分顺序，并应用于HumanEval和ParEval的子集。

Result: 实验显示不同任务对提示细节的敏感度不同，明确输入输出规范、边缘案例处理和逐步分解是提升性能的关键。

Conclusion: 提示细节的优化可以显著提升LLMs在专用任务中的表现，尤其是在明确规范和处理复杂情况时。

Abstract: State-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve high pass@1 on general
benchmarks like HumanEval but underperform on specialized suites such as
ParEval. Is this due to LLMs missing domain knowledge or insufficient prompt
detail is given? To answer this, we introduce PartialOrderEval, which augments
any code generation benchmark with a partial order of prompts from minimal to
maximally detailed. Applying it to HumanEval and both serial and OpenMP subsets
of ParEval, we measure how pass@1 scales with prompt specificity. Our
experiments with Llama-3.x and Qwen2.5-Coder demonstrate varying degrees of
prompt sensitivity across different tasks, and a qualitative analysis
highlights explicit I/O specifications, edge-case handling, and stepwise
breakdowns as the key drivers of prompt detail improvement.

Conclusion: CompassVerifier和VerifierBench将推动答案验证、评估协议和强化学习研究。

Abstract: Answer verification is crucial not only for evaluating large language models
(LLMs) by matching their unstructured outputs against standard answers, but
also serves as the reward model to guide LLM optimization. Most evaluation
frameworks rely on regularized matching or employ general LLMs for answer
verification, which demands extensive, repetitive customization for regex rules
or evaluation prompts. Two fundamental limitations persist in current
methodologies: 1) the absence of comprehensive benchmarks that systematically
evaluate verification capabilities across different LLMs; and 2) the nascent
stage of verifier development, where existing approaches lack both the
robustness to handle complex edge cases and the generalizability across
different domains. In this work, we develop CompassVerifier, an accurate and
robust lightweight verifier model for evaluation and outcome reward. It
demonstrates multi-domain competency spanning math, knowledge, and diverse
reasoning tasks, with the capability to process various answer types, including
multi-subproblems, formulas, and sequence answers, while effectively
identifying abnormal/invalid responses. We introduce VerifierBench benchmark
comprising model outputs collected from multiple data sources, augmented
through manual analysis of metaerror patterns to enhance CompassVerifier. We
anticipate that CompassVerifier and VerifierBench will facilitate answer
verification, evaluation protocols, and reinforcement learning research. Code

Abstract: The growing integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into education has
intensified the need for transparency and interpretability. While hackathons
have long served as agile environments for rapid AI prototyping, few have
directly addressed eXplainable AI (XAI) in real-world educational contexts.
This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the XAI Challenge 2025, a
hackathon-style competition jointly organized by Ho Chi Minh City University of
Technology (HCMUT) and the International Workshop on Trustworthiness and
Reliability in Neurosymbolic AI (TRNS-AI), held as part of the International
Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN 2025). The challenge tasked
participants with building Question-Answering (QA) systems capable of answering
student queries about university policies while generating clear, logic-based
natural language explanations. To promote transparency and trustworthiness,
solutions were required to use lightweight Large Language Models (LLMs) or
hybrid LLM-symbolic systems. A high-quality dataset was provided, constructed
via logic-based templates with Z3 validation and refined through expert student
review to ensure alignment with real-world academic scenarios. We describe the
challenge's motivation, structure, dataset construction, and evaluation
protocol. Situating the competition within the broader evolution of AI
hackathons, we argue that it represents a novel effort to bridge LLMs and
symbolic reasoning in service of explainability. Our findings offer actionable
insights for future XAI-centered educational systems and competitive research
initiatives.

with pyramid grid alignment feedback loops. Additionally, innovative
breakthroughs have been made in the field of computer vision through the
adoption of Transformer-based temporal analysis architectures. Given these
advancements, this study aims to deeply optimize and improve the existing Pymaf

self-attention mechanisms to enhance the capture of low-level features; (2)
Enhancing the understanding and capture of temporal signals in video sequences
through feature temporal fusion techniques; (3) Implementing spatial pyramid
structures to achieve multi-scale feature fusion, effectively balancing feature
representations differences across different scales. The new PyCAT4 model
obtained in this study is validated through experiments on the COCO and 3DPW

Abstract: Video virtual try-on (VVT) technology has garnered considerable academic
interest owing to its promising applications in e-commerce advertising and
entertainment. However, most existing end-to-end methods rely heavily on scarce
paired garment-centric datasets and fail to effectively leverage priors of
advanced visual models and test-time inputs, making it challenging to
accurately preserve fine-grained garment details and maintain temporal
consistency in unconstrained scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose
DreamVVT, a carefully designed two-stage framework built upon Diffusion
Transformers (DiTs), which is inherently capable of leveraging diverse unpaired
human-centric data to enhance adaptability in real-world scenarios. To further
leverage prior knowledge from pretrained models and test-time inputs, in the
first stage, we sample representative frames from the input video and utilize a
multi-frame try-on model integrated with a vision-language model (VLM), to
synthesize high-fidelity and semantically consistent keyframe try-on images.
These images serve as complementary appearance guidance for subsequent video
generation. \textbf{In the second stage}, skeleton maps together with
fine-grained motion and appearance descriptions are extracted from the input
content, and these along with the keyframe try-on images are then fed into a
pretrained video generation model enhanced with LoRA adapters. This ensures
long-term temporal coherence for unseen regions and enables highly plausible
dynamic motions. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate
that DreamVVT surpasses existing methods in preserving detailed garment content
and temporal stability in real-world scenarios. Our project page

TL;DR: VideoForest是一个通过人物锚定分层推理解决跨视频问答挑战的新框架，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨视频问答在建立视频间联系和多源信息检索方面存在挑战，需要新方法。

Method: VideoForest采用人物锚定特征提取、多粒度树结构和多代理推理框架。

Result: 在人物识别、行为分析和推理任务中分别达到71.93%、83.75%和51.67%的准确率。

Conclusion: VideoForest通过人物级特征统一多视频流，实现了高效的跨视频推理。

Abstract: Cross-video question answering presents significant challenges beyond
traditional single-video understanding, particularly in establishing meaningful
connections across video streams and managing the complexity of multi-source
information retrieval. We introduce VideoForest, a novel framework that
addresses these challenges through person-anchored hierarchical reasoning. Our
approach leverages person-level features as natural bridge points between
videos, enabling effective cross-video understanding without requiring
end-to-end training. VideoForest integrates three key innovations: 1) a
human-anchored feature extraction mechanism that employs ReID and tracking
algorithms to establish robust spatiotemporal relationships across multiple
video sources; 2) a multi-granularity spanning tree structure that
hierarchically organizes visual content around person-level trajectories; and
3) a multi-agent reasoning framework that efficiently traverses this
hierarchical structure to answer complex cross-video queries. To evaluate our
approach, we develop CrossVideoQA, a comprehensive benchmark dataset
specifically designed for person-centric cross-video analysis. Experimental
results demonstrate VideoForest's superior performance in cross-video reasoning
tasks, achieving 71.93% accuracy in person recognition, 83.75% in behavior
analysis, and 51.67% in summarization and reasoning, significantly
outperforming existing methods. Our work establishes a new paradigm for
cross-video understanding by unifying multiple video streams through
person-level features, enabling sophisticated reasoning across distributed
visual information while maintaining computational efficiency.

TL;DR: 论文提出在IJEPA架构中用DynTanh激活替代层归一化（LN），以保留视觉标记的自然能量分布，从而提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 层归一化（LN）破坏了视觉标记的自然能量层级，导致语义重要区域无法被优先处理，同时引入棋盘状伪影。

Method: 用DynTanh激活替代LN，保留标记能量分布，使高能量标记对预测损失贡献更大。

Result: 改进后的模型在ImageNet线性探针准确率从38%提升至42.7%，并在NYU Depth V2上降低RMSE 0.08。

Conclusion: 保留标记的自然能量分布对自监督视觉表示学习至关重要。

Abstract: In the standard image joint embedding predictive architecture (IJEPA),
features at the output of the teacher encoder are layer normalized (LN) before
serving as a distillation target for the student encoder and predictor. We
propose that this feature normalization disrupts the natural energy hierarchy
of visual tokens, where high-energy tokens (those with larger L2 norms) encode
semantically important image regions. LN forces all features to have identical
L2 norms, effectively equalizing their energies and preventing the model from
prioritizing semantically rich regions. We find that IJEPA models trained with
feature LN exhibit loss maps with significant checkerboard-like artifacts. We
propose that feature LN be replaced with a DynTanh activation as the latter
better preserves token energies and allows high-energy tokens to greater
contribute to the prediction loss. We show that IJEPA trained with feature
DynTanh exhibits a longer-tailed loss distribution and fixes the checkerboard
artifacts in the loss map. Our empirical results show that our simple
modification improves ImageNet linear probe accuracy from 38% to 42.7% for
ViT-Small and reduces RMSE by 0.08 on NYU Depth V2 monocular depth estimation.
These results suggest that preserving natural token energies is crucial for
effective self-supervised visual representation learning.

<details>

Motivation: 现有2D剪影和骨架表示无法充分捕捉视角变化和步态细节，需要更丰富的输入模态。

Method: 提出DepthGait框架，从RGB图像序列估计深度图作为新模态，并结合剪影，开发多尺度跨层次融合方案。

Result: 在标准基准测试中达到最优性能，并在挑战性数据集中取得高平均rank-1准确率。

Conclusion: DepthGait通过引入深度图和融合方案，显著提升了步态识别的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Robust gait recognition requires highly discriminative representations, which
are closely tied to input modalities. While binary silhouettes and skeletons
have dominated recent literature, these 2D representations fall short of
capturing sufficient cues that can be exploited to handle viewpoint variations,
and capture finer and meaningful details of gait. In this paper, we introduce a
novel framework, termed DepthGait, that incorporates RGB-derived depth maps and
silhouettes for enhanced gait recognition. Specifically, apart from the 2D
silhouette representation of the human body, the proposed pipeline explicitly
estimates depth maps from a given RGB image sequence and uses them as a new
modality to capture discriminative features inherent in human locomotion. In
addition, a novel multi-scale and cross-level fusion scheme has also been
developed to bridge the modality gap between depth maps and silhouettes.
Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed
DepthGait achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to peer methods and
attains an impressive mean rank-1 accuracy on the challenging datasets.

Motivation: NeRF难以编辑，而GS缺乏NeRF的渲染质量。GENIE旨在结合两者的优势，实现高质量且可交互的3D场景表示。

Conclusion: GENIE成功结合了隐式和显式表示的优势，为3D场景编辑和渲染提供了新方法。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting (GS) have recently
transformed 3D scene representation and rendering. NeRF achieves high-fidelity
novel view synthesis by learning volumetric representations through neural
networks, but its implicit encoding makes editing and physical interaction
challenging. In contrast, GS represents scenes as explicit collections of
Gaussian primitives, enabling real-time rendering, faster training, and more
intuitive manipulation. This explicit structure has made GS particularly
well-suited for interactive editing and integration with physics-based
simulation. In this paper, we introduce GENIE (Gaussian Encoding for Neural
Radiance Fields Interactive Editing), a hybrid model that combines the
photorealistic rendering quality of NeRF with the editable and structured
representation of GS. Instead of using spherical harmonics for appearance
modeling, we assign each Gaussian a trainable feature embedding. These
embeddings are used to condition a NeRF network based on the k nearest
Gaussians to each query point. To make this conditioning efficient, we
introduce Ray-Traced Gaussian Proximity Search (RT-GPS), a fast nearest
Gaussian search based on a modified ray-tracing pipeline. We also integrate a
multi-resolution hash grid to initialize and update Gaussian features.
Together, these components enable real-time, locality-aware editing: as
Gaussian primitives are repositioned or modified, their interpolated influence
is immediately reflected in the rendered output. By combining the strengths of
implicit and explicit representations, GENIE supports intuitive scene
manipulation, dynamic interaction, and compatibility with physical simulation,
bridging the gap between geometry-based editing and neural rendering. The code

Motivation: 医学图像的高质量像素级标注成本高且需要专业知识，粗标注虽易获取但噪声多，需解决这一问题。

Method: 引入转移矩阵建模粗标注中的噪声区域，通过联合训练多组粗标注逐步优化网络输出，推断真实分割分布。

Result: 在ACDC、MSCMRseg和UK Biobank数据集上验证，性能优于现有弱监督方法，接近全监督方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过粗标注实现了接近全监督的分割效果，为医学图像分割提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: High-quality pixel-level annotations of medical images are essential for
supervised segmentation tasks, but obtaining such annotations is costly and
requires medical expertise. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
coarse-to-fine segmentation framework that relies entirely on coarse-level
annotations, encompassing both target and complementary drawings, despite their
inherent noise. The framework works by introducing transition matrices in order
to model the inaccurate and incomplete regions in the coarse annotations. By
jointly training on multiple sets of coarse annotations, it progressively
refines the network's outputs and infers the true segmentation distribution,
achieving a robust approximation of precise labels through matrix-based
modeling. To validate the flexibility and effectiveness of the proposed method,
we demonstrate the results on two public cardiac imaging datasets, ACDC and
MSCMRseg, and further evaluate its performance on the UK Biobank dataset.
Experimental results indicate that our approach surpasses the state-of-the-art
weakly supervised methods and closely matches the fully supervised approach.

TL;DR: MIDAR是一个LiDAR检测模拟模型，用于在微观交通模拟器中生成接近真实的LiDAR检测数据，弥补了现有模拟器在感知建模能力上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大规模真实自动驾驶车辆部署不现实，现有模拟器在生成高保真感知数据或扩展性方面存在局限，需要一种能在微观交通模拟器中模拟真实LiDAR检测的方法。

Method: 提出MIDAR模型，利用车辆级特征和GRU增强的APPNP架构，通过构建RM-LoS图编码遮挡关系，预测真实LiDAR检测结果中的真阳性和假阴性。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，MIDAR的AUC达到0.909，接近主流3D LiDAR检测模型CenterPoint的结果，并验证了其在协同感知交通应用中的必要性。

Conclusion: MIDAR能无缝集成到交通模拟器和轨迹数据集中，为需要精确车辆观测的任务提供支持，并将开源发布。

Abstract: As autonomous driving (AD) technology advances, increasing research has
focused on leveraging cooperative perception (CP) data collected from multiple
AVs to enhance traffic applications. Due to the impracticality of large-scale
real-world AV deployments, simulation has become the primary approach in most
studies. While game-engine-based simulators like CARLA generate high-fidelity
raw sensor data (e.g., LiDAR point clouds) which can be used to produce
realistic detection outputs, they face scalability challenges in multi-AV
scenarios. In contrast, microscopic traffic simulators such as SUMO scale
efficiently but lack perception modeling capabilities. To bridge this gap, we
propose MIDAR, a LiDAR detection mimicking model that approximates realistic
LiDAR detections using vehicle-level features readily available from
microscopic traffic simulators. Specifically, MIDAR predicts true positives
(TPs) and false negatives (FNs) from ideal LiDAR detection results based on the
spatial layouts and dimensions of surrounding vehicles. A Refined Multi-hop
Line-of-Sight (RM-LoS) graph is constructed to encode the occlusion
relationships among vehicles, upon which MIDAR employs a GRU-enhanced APPNP
architecture to propagate features from the ego AV and occluding vehicles to
the prediction target. MIDAR achieves an AUC of 0.909 in approximating the
detection results generated by CenterPoint, a mainstream 3D LiDAR detection
model, on the nuScenes AD dataset. Two CP-based traffic applications further
validate the necessity of such realistic detection modeling, particularly for
tasks requiring accurate individual vehicle observations (e.g., position,
speed, lane index). As demonstrated in the applications, MIDAR can be
seamlessly integrated into traffic simulators and trajectory datasets and will
be open-sourced upon publication.

Abstract: In 2012, AlexNet established deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) as
the state-of-the-art in CV, as these networks soon led in visual tasks for many
domains, including remote sensing. With the publication of Visual Transformers,
we are witnessing the second modern leap in computational vision, and as such,
it is imperative to understand how various transformer-based neural networks
perform on satellite imagery. While transformers have shown high levels of
performance in natural language processing and CV applications, they have yet
to be compared on a large scale to modern remote sensing data. In this paper,
we explore the use of transformer-based neural networks for object detection in
high-resolution electro-optical satellite imagery, demonstrating
state-of-the-art performance on a variety of publicly available benchmark data
sets. We compare eleven distinct bounding-box detection and localization
algorithms in this study, of which seven were published since 2020, and all
eleven since 2015. The performance of five transformer-based architectures is
compared with six convolutional networks on three state-of-the-art opensource
high-resolution remote sensing imagery datasets ranging in size and complexity.
Following the training and evaluation of thirty-three deep neural models, we
then discuss and analyze model performance across various feature extraction
methodologies and detection algorithms.

Abstract: How would the sound in a studio change with a carpeted floor and acoustic
tiles on the walls? We introduce the task of material-controlled acoustic
profile generation, where, given an indoor scene with specific audio-visual
characteristics, the goal is to generate a target acoustic profile based on a
user-defined material configuration at inference time. We address this task
with a novel encoder-decoder approach that encodes the scene's key properties
from an audio-visual observation and generates the target Room Impulse Response
(RIR) conditioned on the material specifications provided by the user. Our
model enables the generation of diverse RIRs based on various material
configurations defined dynamically at inference time. To support this task, we
create a new benchmark, the Acoustic Wonderland Dataset, designed for
developing and evaluating material-aware RIR prediction methods under diverse
and challenging settings. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model
effectively encodes material information and generates high-fidelity RIRs,
outperforming several baselines and state-of-the-art methods.

Method: VisuCraft整合了多模态结构化信息提取器（E）和动态提示生成模块（G），优化LVLMs的提示生成。

Result: 在ImageStoryGen-500K数据集上，VisuCraft在视觉基础、创意和指令遵循方面优于基线模型。

Conclusion: VisuCraft为LVLMs在高级创意AI应用中开辟了新潜力。

Abstract: This paper introduces VisuCraft, a novel framework designed to significantly
enhance the capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in complex
visual-guided creative content generation. Existing LVLMs often exhibit
limitations in maintaining high visual fidelity, genuine creativity, and
precise adherence to nuanced user instructions when generating long-form texts.
VisuCraft addresses these challenges by integrating a multimodal structured
information extractor (E) and a dynamic prompt generation module (G). The
extractor distills fine-grained visual attributes from input images into a
rich, structured representation, which the dynamic prompt module then combines
with user instructions to create highly optimized prompts for underlying LVLMs
(e.g., LLaVA, InstructBLIP). Evaluated on the self-constructed
ImageStoryGen-500K dataset using VisuGen Metrics (Visual Grounding, Creativity,
and Instruction Adherence), VisuCraft consistently outperforms baseline LVLMs
across tasks like story generation and poetry composition. Our results
demonstrate remarkable improvements, particularly in creativity and instruction
adherence, validating VisuCraft's effectiveness in producing imaginative,
visually grounded, and user-aligned long-form creative text. This work unlocks
new potential for LVLMs in sophisticated creative AI applications.

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have demonstrated significant success
in unsupervised anomaly segmentation. For anomaly segmentation, these models
are first trained on normal data; then, an anomalous image is noised to an
intermediate step, and the normal image is reconstructed through backward
diffusion. Unlike traditional statistical methods, diffusion models do not rely
on specific assumptions about the data or target anomalies, making them
versatile for use across different domains. However, diffusion models typically
assume access to normal data for training, limiting their applicability in
realistic settings. In this paper, we propose novel robust denoising diffusion
models for scenarios where only contaminated (i.e., a mix of normal and
anomalous) unlabeled data is available. By casting maximum likelihood
estimation of the data as a nonlinear regression problem, we reinterpret the
denoising diffusion probabilistic model through a regression lens. Using robust
regression, we derive a robust version of denoising diffusion probabilistic
models. Our novel framework offers flexibility in constructing various robust
diffusion models. Our experiments show that our approach outperforms current
state of the art diffusion models, for unsupervised anomaly segmentation when
only contaminated data is available. Our method outperforms existing
diffusion-based approaches, achieving up to 8.08\% higher AUROC and 10.37\%
higher AUPRC on MVTec datasets. The implementation code is available at:

Conclusion: 现成LVLMs在VLN任务中表现尚可，但仍有改进空间，需进一步优化。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) refers to the task of enabling
autonomous robots to navigate unfamiliar environments by following natural
language instructions. While recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have
shown promise in this task, most current VLM systems rely on models
specifically designed and optimized for navigation, leaving the potential of
off-the-shelf LVLMs underexplored. Furthermore, while older VLN approaches used
low-level action spaces with egocentric views and atomic actions (such as "turn
left" or "move forward"), newer models tend to favor panoramic action spaces
with discrete navigable viewpoints. This paper investigates (1) whether
off-the-shelf LVLMs (fine-tuned without architectural modifications or
simulator-based training) can effectively support VLN tasks and (2) whether
such models can support both low-level and panoramic action paradigms. To this
end, we fine-tune the open-source model Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct on the
Room-to-Room (R2R) dataset and evaluate its empirical performance across both
low-level and panoramic action spaces. The best resulting model achieves a 41%
success rate on the R2R test set, demonstrating that while off-the-shelf LVLMs
can learn to perform Vision-and-Language Navigation, they still lag behind
models specifically designed for this task.

Motivation: MAP估计在盲去卷积中常因稀疏性先验导致模糊解，限制了其效果。本文旨在通过扩散先验模型重新审视这一问题。

Conclusion: 扩散先验模型揭示了盲去卷积问题的关键性质，为设计更好的先验和优化方法提供了理论支持。

Abstract: The Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation is a widely used framework in blind
deconvolution to recover sharp images from blurred observations. The estimated
image and blur filter are defined as the maximizer of the posterior
distribution. However, when paired with sparsity-promoting image priors, MAP
estimation has been shown to favors blurry solutions, limiting its
effectiveness. In this paper, we revisit this result using diffusion-based
priors, a class of models that capture realistic image distributions. Through
an empirical examination of the prior's likelihood landscape, we uncover two
key properties: first, blurry images tend to have higher likelihoods; second,
the landscape contains numerous local minimizers that correspond to natural
images. Building on these insights, we provide a theoretical analysis of the
blind deblurring posterior. This reveals that the MAP estimator tends to
produce sharp filters (close to the Dirac delta function) and blurry solutions.
However local minimizers of the posterior, which can be obtained with gradient
descent, correspond to realistic, natural images, effectively solving the blind
deconvolution problem. Our findings suggest that overcoming MAP's limitations
requires good local initialization to local minima in the posterior landscape.
We validate our analysis with numerical experiments, demonstrating the
practical implications of our insights for designing improved priors and
optimization techniques.

Conclusion: 建议实践中仍使用预训练，并避免选择过小的模型，以确保在不同工作条件下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Many real-world applications require recognition models that are robust to
different operational conditions and modalities, but at the same time run on
small embedded devices, with limited hardware. While for normal size models,
pre-training is known to be very beneficial in accuracy and robustness, for
small models, that can be employed for embedded and edge devices, its effect is
not clear. In this work, we investigate the effect of ImageNet pretraining on
increasingly small backbone architectures (ultra-small models, with $<$1M
parameters) with respect to robustness in downstream object detection tasks in
the infrared visual modality. Using scaling laws derived from standard object
recognition architectures, we construct two ultra-small backbone families and
systematically study their performance. Our experiments on three different
datasets reveal that while ImageNet pre-training is still useful, beyond a
certain capacity threshold, it offers diminishing returns in terms of
out-of-distribution detection robustness. Therefore, we advise practitioners to
still use pre-training and, when possible avoid too small models as while they
might work well for in-domain problems, they are brittle when working
conditions are different.

Motivation: 现有方法主要关注唇同步和短时视觉保真度，而X-Actor旨在实现演员级别的长时肖像表演，捕捉动态演化的情感。

Method: 采用两阶段解耦生成流程：1）基于音频的自回归扩散模型预测面部运动潜在标记；2）扩散视频合成模块生成高保真视频动画。

Result: X-Actor能够生成情感丰富、无限长度的动画，并在长时音频驱动情感肖像表演中达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: X-Actor超越了标准头部动画，实现了电影级的情感表演效果。

Abstract: We present X-Actor, a novel audio-driven portrait animation framework that
generates lifelike, emotionally expressive talking head videos from a single
reference image and an input audio clip. Unlike prior methods that emphasize
lip synchronization and short-range visual fidelity in constrained speaking
scenarios, X-Actor enables actor-quality, long-form portrait performance
capturing nuanced, dynamically evolving emotions that flow coherently with the
rhythm and content of speech. Central to our approach is a two-stage decoupled
generation pipeline: an audio-conditioned autoregressive diffusion model that
predicts expressive yet identity-agnostic facial motion latent tokens within a
long temporal context window, followed by a diffusion-based video synthesis
module that translates these motions into high-fidelity video animations. By
operating in a compact facial motion latent space decoupled from visual and
identity cues, our autoregressive diffusion model effectively captures
long-range correlations between audio and facial dynamics through a
diffusion-forcing training paradigm, enabling infinite-length emotionally-rich
motion prediction without error accumulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that X-Actor produces compelling, cinematic-style performances that go beyond
standard talking head animations and achieves state-of-the-art results in
long-range, audio-driven emotional portrait acting.

### [120] [Towards Robust Image Denoising with Scale Equivariance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02967)
*Dawei Zhang,Xiaojie Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于尺度等变性的盲去噪框架，通过HNM和IGM模块提升模型对空间非均匀噪声的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去噪模型在空间非均匀噪声（OOD条件）下泛化能力不足，尺度等变性可能改善这一问题。

Method: 提出HNM模块稳定特征分布并动态校正噪声强度变化，IGM模块通过门控交互调节信号与特征路径的信息流。

Result: 模型在合成和真实数据集上均优于现有方法，尤其在空间非均匀噪声下表现突出。

Conclusion: 尺度等变性是提升去噪模型OOD鲁棒性的有效归纳偏置，提出的框架具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Despite notable advances in image denoising, existing models often struggle
to generalize beyond in-distribution noise patterns, particularly when
confronted with out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions characterized by spatially
variant noise. This generalization gap remains a fundamental yet underexplored
challenge. In this work, we investigate \emph{scale equivariance} as a core
inductive bias for improving OOD robustness. We argue that incorporating
scale-equivariant structures enables models to better adapt from training on
spatially uniform noise to inference on spatially non-uniform degradations.
Building on this insight, we propose a robust blind denoising framework
equipped with two key components: a Heterogeneous Normalization Module (HNM)
and an Interactive Gating Module (IGM). HNM stabilizes feature distributions
and dynamically corrects features under varying noise intensities, while IGM
facilitates effective information modulation via gated interactions between
signal and feature paths. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our model
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and
real-world benchmarks, especially under spatially heterogeneous noise. Code
will be made publicly available.

*Alakh Desai,Nuno Vasconcelos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ANSWER是一种无需训练的技术，通过结合负提示和分类器自由引导（CFG）来提升扩散模型生成图像的提示忠实度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在生成图像时对提示的忠实度和质量存在显著差异，负提示虽能改善提示遵从性，但需要外部资源且不完整。

Method: 提出ANSWER方法，利用扩散模型对否定的内部理解，结合CFG，从单一提示中同时处理正负条件。

Result: ANSWER在多个基准测试中优于基线方法，人类偏好度是其他方法的2倍。

Conclusion: ANSWER是一种高效且无需额外训练的技术，显著提升了扩散模型生成图像的提示忠实度。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have demonstrated an unparalleled ability to create
diverse and high-fidelity images from text prompts. However, they are also
well-known to vary substantially regarding both prompt adherence and quality.
Negative prompting was introduced to improve prompt compliance by specifying
what an image must not contain. Previous works have shown the existence of an
ideal negative prompt that can maximize the odds of the positive prompt. In
this work, we explore relations between negative prompting and classifier-free
guidance (CFG) to develop a sampling procedure, {\it Adaptive Negative Sampling
Without External Resources} (ANSWER), that accounts for both positive and
negative conditions from a single prompt. This leverages the internal
understanding of negation by the diffusion model to increase the odds of
generating images faithful to the prompt. ANSWER is a training-free technique,
applicable to any model that supports CFG, and allows for negative grounding of
image concepts without an explicit negative prompts, which are lossy and
incomplete. Experiments show that adding ANSWER to existing DMs outperforms the
baselines on multiple benchmarks and is preferred by humans 2x more over the
other methods.

Motivation: 现有多领域学习架构中，共享LoRA和领域特定LoRA是否能有效捕捉领域特定信息尚不明确。

Method: 提出一种方法，将共享和领域特定LoRA分别置于预训练权重的列空间和左零空间。

Result: 在UCF101、Kinetics400和HMDB51数据集上的动作识别任务中验证了方法的有效性，并分析了LoRA权重的维度。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效区分共享和领域特定信息，提升多领域学习性能。

Abstract: Existing architectures of multi-domain learning have two types of adapters:
shared LoRA for all domains and domain-specific LoRA for each particular
domain. However, it remains unclear whether this structure effectively captures
domain-specific information. In this paper, we propose a method that ensures
that shared and domain-specific LoRAs exist in different subspaces;
specifically, the column and left null subspaces of the pre-trained weights. We
apply the proposed method to action recognition with three datasets (UCF101,
Kinetics400, and HMDB51) and demonstrate its effectiveness in some cases along
with the analysis of the dimensions of LoRA weights.

Abstract: Modern action recognition models suffer from static bias, leading to reduced

domain adaptation between RGB and edge information using edge frames in
addition to RGB frames to counter the static bias issue. Experiments
demonstrate that the proposed method effectively suppresses static bias with a
lower computational cost, allowing for more robust action recognition than
previous approaches.

TL;DR: AFOG是一种针对目标检测变换器的对抗性扰动方法，通过可学习的注意力机制提升攻击效果，适用于CNN和变换器检测器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗性扰动方法在攻击变换器检测器时效果有限，AFOG旨在填补这一空白。

Method: AFOG利用可学习的注意力机制聚焦脆弱区域，结合特征损失和迭代扰动注入。

Result: AFOG在COCO数据集上攻击12种大型检测变换器，性能提升高达83%。

Conclusion: AFOG是一种高效、隐蔽且通用的对抗性扰动方法，显著优于现有攻击方法。

Abstract: Adversarial perturbations are useful tools for exposing vulnerabilities in
neural networks. Existing adversarial perturbation methods for object detection
are either limited to attacking CNN-based detectors or weak against
transformer-based detectors. This paper presents an Attention-Focused Offensive
Gradient (AFOG) attack against object detection transformers. By design, AFOG
is neural-architecture agnostic and effective for attacking both large
transformer-based object detectors and conventional CNN-based detectors with a
unified adversarial attention framework. This paper makes three original
contributions. First, AFOG utilizes a learnable attention mechanism that
focuses perturbations on vulnerable image regions in multi-box detection tasks,
increasing performance over non-attention baselines by up to 30.6%. Second,
AFOG's attack loss is formulated by integrating two types of feature loss
through learnable attention updates with iterative injection of adversarial
perturbations. Finally, AFOG is an efficient and stealthy adversarial
perturbation method. It probes the weak spots of detection transformers by
adding strategically generated and visually imperceptible perturbations which
can cause well-trained object detection models to fail. Extensive experiments
conducted with twelve large detection transformers on COCO demonstrate the
efficacy of AFOG. Our empirical results also show that AFOG outperforms
existing attacks on transformer-based and CNN-based object detectors by up to
83% with superior speed and imperceptibility. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩散过程的噪声预测方法（IGD），用于在生成过程中检测NSFW内容，准确率达91.32%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在生成高质量图像的同时，可能被滥用生成NSFW内容，现有方法主要集中在生成前或生成后检测，而生成过程中的检测尚未充分探索。

Method: 利用扩散过程中预测的噪声作为内部信号，通过语义线索区分NSFW与良性提示。

Result: 在七类NSFW内容上，IGD的平均检测准确率为91.32%，优于七种基线方法。

Conclusion: IGD是一种简单有效的方法，填补了扩散模型生成过程中NSFW检测的空白。

Abstract: Diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models enable high-quality image
generation but also pose significant risks of misuse, particularly in producing
not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content. While prior detection methods have focused on
filtering prompts before generation or moderating images afterward, the
in-generation phase of diffusion models remains largely unexplored for NSFW
detection. In this paper, we introduce In-Generation Detection (IGD), a simple
yet effective approach that leverages the predicted noise during the diffusion
process as an internal signal to identify NSFW content. This approach is
motivated by preliminary findings suggesting that the predicted noise may
capture semantic cues that differentiate NSFW from benign prompts, even when
the prompts are adversarially crafted. Experiments conducted on seven NSFW
categories show that IGD achieves an average detection accuracy of 91.32% over
naive and adversarial NSFW prompts, outperforming seven baseline methods.

### [126] [Multi-Granularity Feature Calibration via VFM for Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03007)
*Xinhui Li,Xiaojie Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了多粒度特征校准（MGFC）框架，通过分层特征校准提升域泛化语义分割的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注全局特征微调，忽略了分层特征适应对密集预测任务的重要性。

Method: MGFC框架分三个阶段校准特征：粗粒度（全局语义）、中粒度（类别区分）和细粒度（空间细节）。

Result: 在基准数据集上，MGFC优于现有方法，验证了多粒度校准的有效性。

Conclusion: 分层和多粒度特征校准显著提升了域泛化语义分割的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS) aims to improve the
generalization ability of models across unseen domains without access to target
data during training. Recent advances in DGSS have increasingly exploited
vision foundation models (VFMs) via parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies.
However, most existing approaches concentrate on global feature fine-tuning,
while overlooking hierarchical adaptation across feature levels, which is
crucial for precise dense prediction. In this paper, we propose
Multi-Granularity Feature Calibration (MGFC), a novel framework that performs
coarse-to-fine alignment of VFM features to enhance robustness under domain
shifts. Specifically, MGFC first calibrates coarse-grained features to capture
global contextual semantics and scene-level structure. Then, it refines
medium-grained features by promoting category-level feature discriminability.
Finally, fine-grained features are calibrated through high-frequency spatial
detail enhancement. By performing hierarchical and granularity-aware
calibration, MGFC effectively transfers the generalization strengths of VFMs to
the domain-specific task of DGSS. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art DGSS approaches,
highlighting the effectiveness of multi-granularity adaptation for the semantic
segmentation task of domain generalization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SLFG的新方法，通过将视频帧组合成语义连贯的场景帧，提升多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在长视频理解中的表现，并引入了SceneQA任务和LVSQA数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在长视频理解中表现不佳，主要因资源限制无法处理所有帧信息，且现有框架和任务不切实际。

Method: 提出SLFG方法，结合场景定位和动态帧重组机制，无需修改原模型架构。

Result: 实验表明SLFG在多个长视频基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: SLFG方法有效提升了MLLMs的长视频理解能力，具有即插即用性。

Abstract: Current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often perform poorly in long
video understanding, primarily due to resource limitations that prevent them
from processing all video frames and their associated information. Efficiently
extracting relevant information becomes a challenging task. Existing frameworks
and evaluation tasks focus on identifying specific frames containing core
objects from a large number of irrelevant frames, which does not align with the
practical needs of real-world applications. To address this issue, we propose a
new scenario under the video question-answering task, SceneQA, which emphasizes
scene-based detail perception and reasoning abilities. And we develop the LVSQA
dataset to support the SceneQA task, which is built upon carefully selected
videos from LVBench and contains a new collection of question-answer pairs to
promote a more fair evaluation of MLLMs' scene perception abilities in long
videos. Inspired by human cognition, we introduce a novel method called SLFG.
The core idea of SLFG is to combine individual frames into semantically
coherent scene frames. By leveraging scene localization methods and dynamic
frame reassembly mechanisms, SLFG significantly enhances the understanding
capabilities of existing MLLMs in long videos. SLFG requires no modification to
the original model architecture and boasts excellent plug-and-play usability.
Experimental results show that this method performs exceptionally well in
several long video benchmark tests. Code and dataset will be released at
http://www.slfg.pkuzwh.cn.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SA-3DGS提出了一种方法，通过重要性评分和聚类压缩高斯点，显著降低存储成本并保持渲染质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D高斯泼溅方法需要大量高斯点，导致存储需求高且难以识别不重要的高斯点，影响压缩和渲染性能。

Method: SA-3DGS通过学习重要性评分识别不重要高斯点，利用聚类模块压缩属性到码本，并通过修复模块恢复信息。

Result: 实验显示，该方法实现了高达66倍的压缩，同时保持或提升渲染质量，且适用于其他修剪方法。

Conclusion: SA-3DGS在压缩和渲染质量上表现优异，具有强泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting have enhanced efficient and
high-quality novel view synthesis. However, representing scenes requires a
large number of Gaussian points, leading to high storage demands and limiting
practical deployment. The latest methods facilitate the compression of Gaussian
models but struggle to identify truly insignificant Gaussian points in the
scene, leading to a decline in subsequent Gaussian pruning, compression
quality, and rendering performance. To address this issue, we propose SA-3DGS,
a method that significantly reduces storage costs while maintaining rendering
quality. SA-3DGS learns an importance score to automatically identify the least
significant Gaussians in scene reconstruction, thereby enabling effective
pruning and redundancy reduction. Next, the importance-aware clustering module
compresses Gaussians attributes more accurately into the codebook, improving
the codebook's expressive capability while reducing model size. Finally, the
codebook repair module leverages contextual scene information to repair the
codebook, thereby recovering the original Gaussian point attributes and
mitigating the degradation in rendering quality caused by information loss.
Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that our method
achieves up to 66x compression while maintaining or even improving rendering
quality. The proposed Gaussian pruning approach is not only adaptable to but
also improves other pruning-based methods (e.g., LightGaussian), showcasing
excellent performance and strong generalization ability.

Result: 在CelebIPVid数据集上，MoCA在面部相似性上比现有方法高出5%。

Conclusion: MoCA显著提升了文本到视频生成中的身份一致性和细节表现。

Abstract: Achieving ID-preserving text-to-video (T2V) generation remains challenging
despite recent advances in diffusion-based models. Existing approaches often
fail to capture fine-grained facial dynamics or maintain temporal identity
coherence. To address these limitations, we propose MoCA, a novel Video
Diffusion Model built on a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) backbone, incorporating
a Mixture of Cross-Attention mechanism inspired by the Mixture-of-Experts
paradigm. Our framework improves inter-frame identity consistency by embedding
MoCA layers into each DiT block, where Hierarchical Temporal Pooling captures
identity features over varying timescales, and Temporal-Aware Cross-Attention
Experts dynamically model spatiotemporal relationships. We further incorporate
a Latent Video Perceptual Loss to enhance identity coherence and fine-grained
details across video frames. To train this model, we collect CelebIPVid, a
dataset of 10,000 high-resolution videos from 1,000 diverse individuals,
promoting cross-ethnicity generalization. Extensive experiments on CelebIPVid
show that MoCA outperforms existing T2V methods by over 5% across Face
similarity.

Conclusion: MIT数据集为未来研究提供了有价值的基准，CovOG模型为多人类对话视频生成任务奠定了基础。

Abstract: Existing studies on talking video generation have predominantly focused on
single-person monologues or isolated facial animations, limiting their
applicability to realistic multi-human interactions. To bridge this gap, we
introduce MIT, a large-scale dataset specifically designed for multi-human
talking video generation. To this end, we develop an automatic pipeline that
collects and annotates multi-person conversational videos. The resulting
dataset comprises 12 hours of high-resolution footage, each featuring two to
four speakers, with fine-grained annotations of body poses and speech
interactions. It captures natural conversational dynamics in multi-speaker
scenario, offering a rich resource for studying interactive visual behaviors.
To demonstrate the potential of MIT, we furthur propose CovOG, a baseline model
for this novel task. It integrates a Multi-Human Pose Encoder (MPE) to handle
varying numbers of speakers by aggregating individual pose embeddings, and an
Interactive Audio Driver (IAD) to modulate head dynamics based on
speaker-specific audio features. Together, these components showcase the
feasibility and challenges of generating realistic multi-human talking videos,
establishing MIT as a valuable benchmark for future research. The code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 面部滤镜在遮挡（如手、头发或配饰）时性能下降，需要一种能够精细分离遮挡元素与面部区域的方法。

Method: FaceMat采用两阶段训练流程，教师模型通过NLL损失联合估计alpha遮罩和像素级不确定性，学生模型利用不确定性进行空间自适应知识蒸馏。

Result: FaceMat在多个基准测试中优于现有方法，提升了真实视频场景中面部滤镜的视觉质量和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: FaceMat无需辅助输入，适用于实时应用，并通过新构建的CelebAMat数据集支持遮挡感知的面部遮罩任务。

Abstract: Face filters have become a key element of short-form video content, enabling
a wide array of visual effects such as stylization and face swapping. However,
their performance often degrades in the presence of occlusions, where objects
like hands, hair, or accessories obscure the face. To address this limitation,
we introduce the novel task of face matting, which estimates fine-grained alpha
mattes to separate occluding elements from facial regions. We further present
FaceMat, a trimap-free, uncertainty-aware framework that predicts high-quality
alpha mattes under complex occlusions. Our approach leverages a two-stage
training pipeline: a teacher model is trained to jointly estimate alpha mattes
and per-pixel uncertainty using a negative log-likelihood (NLL) loss, and this
uncertainty is then used to guide the student model through spatially adaptive
knowledge distillation. This formulation enables the student to focus on
ambiguous or occluded regions, improving generalization and preserving semantic
consistency. Unlike previous approaches that rely on trimaps or segmentation
masks, our framework requires no auxiliary inputs making it well-suited for
real-time applications. In addition, we reformulate the matting objective by
explicitly treating skin as foreground and occlusions as background, enabling
clearer compositing strategies. To support this task, we newly constructed
CelebAMat, a large-scale synthetic dataset specifically designed for
occlusion-aware face matting. Extensive experiments show that FaceMat
outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks, enhancing the
visual quality and robustness of face filters in real-world, unconstrained
video scenarios. The source code and CelebAMat dataset are available at

TL;DR: CHARM框架通过互补学习实现模态间的协同和谐，而非同质化，显著提升了多模态语义分割的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过特征对齐实现模态同质化，但削弱了各模态的独特优势和互补性。CHARM旨在实现模态间的协同和谐。

Method: CHARM包含两个组件：1）Mutual Perception Unit（MPU），通过窗口跨模态交互实现隐式对齐；2）双路径优化策略，包括互补融合学习（CoL）和模态特定优化（InE）。

Result: 实验表明，CHARM在多个数据集和骨干网络上表现优于基线方法，尤其在脆弱模态上提升显著。

Conclusion: CHARM将研究重点从同质化转向和谐化，实现了多样性的真正互补。

Abstract: Modality-agnostic Semantic Segmentation (MaSS) aims to achieve robust scene
understanding across arbitrary combinations of input modality. Existing methods
typically rely on explicit feature alignment to achieve modal homogenization,
which dilutes the distinctive strengths of each modality and destroys their
inherent complementarity. To achieve cooperative harmonization rather than
homogenization, we propose CHARM, a novel complementary learning framework
designed to implicitly align content while preserving modality-specific
advantages through two components: (1) Mutual Perception Unit (MPU), enabling
implicit alignment through window-based cross-modal interaction, where
modalities serve as both queries and contexts for each other to discover
modality-interactive correspondences; (2) A dual-path optimization strategy
that decouples training into Collaborative Learning Strategy (CoL) for
complementary fusion learning and Individual Enhancement Strategy (InE) for
protected modality-specific optimization. Experiments across multiple datasets
and backbones indicate that CHARM consistently outperform the baselines, with
significant increment on the fragile modalities. This work shifts the focus
from model homogenization to harmonization, enabling cross-modal
complementarity for true harmony in diversity.

Abstract: This study introduces a novel framework, "Comprehensive Optimization and
Refinement through Ensemble Fusion in Domain Adaptation for Person
Re-identification (CORE-ReID)", to address an Unsupervised Domain Adaptation
(UDA) for Person Re-identification (ReID). The framework utilizes CycleGAN to
generate diverse data that harmonizes differences in image characteristics from
different camera sources in the pre-training stage. In the fine-tuning stage,
based on a pair of teacher-student networks, the framework integrates
multi-view features for multi-level clustering to derive diverse pseudo labels.
A learnable Ensemble Fusion component that focuses on fine-grained local
information within global features is introduced to enhance learning
comprehensiveness and avoid ambiguity associated with multiple pseudo-labels.
Experimental results on three common UDAs in Person ReID demonstrate
significant performance gains over state-of-the-art approaches. Additional
enhancements, such as Efficient Channel Attention Block and Bidirectional Mean
Feature Normalization mitigate deviation effects and adaptive fusion of global
and local features using the ResNet-based model, further strengthening the
framework. The proposed framework ensures clarity in fusion features, avoids
ambiguity, and achieves high ac-curacy in terms of Mean Average Precision,
Top-1, Top-5, and Top-10, positioning it as an advanced and effective solution
for the UDA in Person ReID. Our codes and models are available at

in 3D medical image segmentation, emerging approaches have begun to incorporate
frequency domain representations. However, straightforward feature extraction
strategies often overlook the unique properties of frequency domain
information, such as conjugate symmetry. They also fail to account for the
fundamental differences in data distribution between the spatial and frequency
domains, which can ultimately dilute or obscure the complementary strengths
that frequency-based representations offer. In this paper, we propose SSFMamba,
a Mamba based Symmetry-driven Spatial-Frequency feature fusion network for 3D
medical image segmentation. SSFMamba employs a complementary dual-branch
architecture that extracts features from both the spatial and frequency
domains, and leverages a Mamba block to fuse these heterogeneous features to
preserve global context while reinforcing local details. In the frequency
domain branch, we harness Mamba's exceptional capability to extract global
contextual information in conjunction with the synergistic effect of frequency
domain features to further enhance global modeling. Moreover, we design a 3D
multi-directional scanning mechanism to strengthen the fusion of local and
global cues. Extensive experiments on the BraTS2020 and BraTS2023 datasets
demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across various evaluation metrics.

TL;DR: 提出RobustGS模块，提升3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）在恶劣成像条件下的鲁棒性，实现高质量3D重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有前馈3DGS方法假设输入多视图图像干净高质量，但现实中图像常受噪声、低光或雨等影响，导致重建质量下降。

Method: 引入通用退化学习器和语义感知状态空间模型，增强退化感知并优化特征空间输入，通过语义相似性聚合提升重建质量。

Result: 实验表明，RobustGS模块可无缝集成现有方法，在各种退化条件下实现最先进的重建质量。

Conclusion: RobustGS显著提升了前馈3DGS在恶劣成像条件下的鲁棒性和重建质量。

Abstract: Feedforward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) overcomes the limitations of
optimization-based 3DGS by enabling fast and high-quality reconstruction
without the need for per-scene optimization. However, existing feedforward
approaches typically assume that input multi-view images are clean and
high-quality. In real-world scenarios, images are often captured under
challenging conditions such as noise, low light, or rain, resulting in
inaccurate geometry and degraded 3D reconstruction. To address these
challenges, we propose a general and efficient multi-view feature enhancement
module, RobustGS, which substantially improves the robustness of feedforward
3DGS methods under various adverse imaging conditions, enabling high-quality 3D
reconstruction. The RobustGS module can be seamlessly integrated into existing
pretrained pipelines in a plug-and-play manner to enhance reconstruction
robustness. Specifically, we introduce a novel component, Generalized
Degradation Learner, designed to extract generic representations and
distributions of multiple degradations from multi-view inputs, thereby
enhancing degradation-awareness and improving the overall quality of 3D
reconstruction. In addition, we propose a novel semantic-aware state-space
model. It first leverages the extracted degradation representations to enhance
corrupted inputs in the feature space. Then, it employs a semantic-aware
strategy to aggregate semantically similar information across different views,
enabling the extraction of fine-grained cross-view correspondences and further
improving the quality of 3D representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our approach, when integrated into existing methods in a plug-and-play
manner, consistently achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality across
various types of degradations.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注人口属性（如种族和性别）的公平性，但对更广泛属性的公平性研究不足。

Method: 利用大型语言模型（LLMs）构建开放集偏置属性知识库，评估LVLMs在细粒度属性上的公平性。

Result: 实验结果表明，LVLMs在多种属性上存在偏见，且文化、环境和行为因素对决策的影响更大。

Conclusion: LVLMs的公平性问题需扩展到更广泛的属性，文化等因素的影响不容忽视。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of applications using Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs), such as GPT-4o, has raised significant concerns about their fairness.
While existing studies primarily focus on demographic attributes such as race
and gender, fairness across a broader range of attributes remains largely
unexplored. In this study, we construct an open-set knowledge base of bias
attributes leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and evaluate the fairness of
LVLMs across finer-grained attributes. Our experimental results reveal that
LVLMs exhibit biased outputs across a diverse set of attributes and further
demonstrate that cultural, environmental, and behavioral factors have a more
pronounced impact on LVLM decision-making than traditional demographic
attributes.

Conclusion: $C^2Aug$通过增加伪袋多样性和对比学习框架，显著提升了模型性能，尤其在处理小肿瘤区域时表现更优。

Abstract: Recent pseudo-bag augmentation methods for Multiple Instance Learning
(MIL)-based Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification sample instances from a
limited number of bags, resulting in constrained diversity. To address this
issue, we propose Contrastive Cross-Bag Augmentation ($C^2Aug$) to sample
instances from all bags with the same class to increase the diversity of
pseudo-bags. However, introducing new instances into the pseudo-bag increases
the number of critical instances (e.g., tumor instances). This increase results
in a reduced occurrence of pseudo-bags containing few critical instances,
thereby limiting model performance, particularly on test slides with small
tumor areas. To address this, we introduce a bag-level and group-level
contrastive learning framework to enhance the discrimination of features with
distinct semantic meanings, thereby improving model performance. Experimental
results demonstrate that $C^2Aug$ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches across multiple evaluation metrics.

Motivation: 现有方法仅依赖简单的文本模板，忽略了更丰富的语义信息，限制了医学图像分类系统的持续学习能力。

Method: 动态构建视觉概念池，采用相似性过滤机制避免冗余，并通过跨模态图像-概念注意力模块和注意力损失整合概念。

Result: 在医学和自然图像数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效且优越，代码将公开。

Abstract: Continual learning is essential for medical image classification systems to
adapt to dynamically evolving clinical environments. The integration of
multimodal information can significantly enhance continual learning of image
classes. However, while existing approaches do utilize textual modality
information, they solely rely on simplistic templates with a class name,
thereby neglecting richer semantic information. To address these limitations,
we propose a novel framework that harnesses visual concepts generated by large
language models (LLMs) as discriminative semantic guidance. Our method
dynamically constructs a visual concept pool with a similarity-based filtering
mechanism to prevent redundancy. Then, to integrate the concepts into the
continual learning process, we employ a cross-modal image-concept attention
module, coupled with an attention loss. Through attention, the module can
leverage the semantic knowledge from relevant visual concepts and produce
class-representative fused features for classification. Experiments on medical
and natural image datasets show our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance, demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of our method. We
will release the code publicly.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法（如GRPO）在数据效率、优势消失和信用分配上的局限性。

Method: 采用离策略训练架构和时序优势塑造（TAS）策略。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，性能提升显著，样本效率提高35%以上。

Conclusion: AVATAR有效解决了多模态长视频推理的挑战，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning over long-horizon video is challenging due to the need
for precise spatiotemporal fusion and alignment across modalities. While recent
methods such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) have shown promise in
this domain, they suffer from three key limitations: (1) data inefficiency from
their on-policy design, (2) a vanishing advantage problem, where identical or
near-identical rewards within a group eliminate the learning signal by
producing zero-valued advantages, and (3) uniform credit assignment that fails
to emphasize critical reasoning steps. We introduce AVATAR (Audio-Video Agent
for Alignment and Reasoning), a framework that addresses these limitations
through two core components: (1) an off-policy training architecture that
improves sample efficiency and resolves vanishing advantages by reusing past
experiences with greater reward diversity, and (2) Temporal Advantage Shaping
(TAS), a novel credit assignment strategy that upweights key reasoning phases
during learning. AVATAR achieves strong performance across various benchmarks,
outperforming the Qwen2.5-Omni baseline by +5.4on MMVU, +4.9 on OmniBench, and
+4.5 on Video-Holmes, while demonstrating over 35% higher sample efficiency.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Causal CLIP Adapter (CCA)的新框架，通过无监督的独立成分分析(ICA)显式解耦CLIP提取的视觉特征，减少可训练参数并避免过拟合。同时，通过单向和双向增强跨模态对齐，提升分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有少样本学习(FSL)方法依赖纠缠表示，需要模型隐式恢复解耦过程，限制了有效适应。

Method: 利用ICA显式解耦CLIP视觉特征，并通过单向（微调文本分类器）和双向（跨注意力机制）增强跨模态对齐。

Result: 在11个基准数据集上，CCA在少样本性能和分布偏移鲁棒性方面优于现有方法，同时保持计算效率。

Conclusion: CCA通过显式解耦和跨模态对齐增强，显著提升了少样本学习的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) often requires effective adaptation of models using
limited labeled data. However, most existing FSL methods rely on entangled
representations, requiring the model to implicitly recover the unmixing process
to obtain disentangled representations using only limited supervision, which
hinders effective adaptation. Recent theoretical studies show that multimodal
contrastive learning methods, such as CLIP, can disentangle latent
representations up to linear transformations. In light of this, we propose the
Causal CLIP Adapter (CCA), a novel framework that explicitly disentangles
visual features extracted from CLIP using unsupervised Independent Component
Analysis (ICA). This removes the need to learn the unmixing process from the
labeled data, thereby reducing the number of trainable parameters and
mitigating overfitting. Taking a step further, while ICA can obtain visual
disentangled representations, it may also disrupt CLIP's intra- and inter-modal
alignment. To counteract this, CCA further leverages CLIP's inherent
cross-modal alignment by enhancing it in two ways: unidirectionally, through
fine-tuning a CLIP-based text classifier, and bidirectionally, via a
cross-attention mechanism that enriches visual and textual representations
through mutual interaction. Both unimodal and cross-modal classification
outputs can be effectively combined linearly to improve classification
accuracy. Extensive experiments on 11 benchmark datasets demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of
few-shot performance and robustness to distributional shifts, while maintaining
computational efficiency. Code will be available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在几何精度和鲁棒性之间存在权衡，H3R旨在通过结合显式和隐式方法的优势来解决这一局限性。

Method: H3R由两部分组成：通过极线约束确保几何一致性的潜在体积模块，以及利用Plücker坐标进行自适应对应优化的相机感知Transformer。

Result: 实验表明，H3R在多个数据集上实现了最先进的性能，PSNR显著提升（如RealEstate10K上提升0.59 dB）。

Conclusion: H3R通过结合两种范式，显著提升了3D重建的泛化能力和效率，同时支持高分辨率输入和跨数据集泛化。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting, generalizable
3D reconstruction remains challenging, particularly in multi-view
correspondence modeling. Existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off:
explicit methods achieve geometric precision but struggle with ambiguous
regions, while implicit methods provide robustness but suffer from slow
convergence. We present H3R, a hybrid framework that addresses this limitation
by integrating volumetric latent fusion with attention-based feature
aggregation. Our framework consists of two complementary components: an
efficient latent volume that enforces geometric consistency through epipolar
constraints, and a camera-aware Transformer that leverages Pl\"ucker
coordinates for adaptive correspondence refinement. By integrating both
paradigms, our approach enhances generalization while converging 2$\times$
faster than existing methods. Furthermore, we show that spatial-aligned
foundation models (e.g., SD-VAE) substantially outperform semantic-aligned
models (e.g., DINOv2), resolving the mismatch between semantic representations
and spatial reconstruction requirements. Our method supports variable-number
and high-resolution input views while demonstrating robust cross-dataset
generalization. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, with significant PSNR
improvements of 0.59 dB, 1.06 dB, and 0.22 dB on the RealEstate10K, ACID, and
DTU datasets, respectively. Code is available at

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) that enable natural language interaction with
satellite imagery can democratize Earth observation by accelerating expert
workflows, making data accessible to non-specialists, and enabling planet-scale
automation. However, existing datasets focus mainly on short-term,
high-resolution imagery from a limited number of satellites, overlooking
low-resolution, multi-satellite, long-term archives, such as Landsat, that are
essential for affordable and bias-robust global monitoring. We address this gap
with Landsat30-AU, a large-scale vision-language dataset built from 30-meter
resolution imagery collected by four Landsat satellites (5, 7, 8, and 9) over
Australia, spanning more than 36 years. The dataset includes two components:
Landsat30-AU-Cap, containing 196,262 image-caption pairs, and Landsat30-AU-VQA,
comprising 17,725 human-verified visual question answering (VQA) samples across
eight remote sensing domains. Both datasets are curated through a bootstrapped
pipeline that leverages generic VLMs with iterative refinement and human
verification to ensure quality. Our evaluation of eight VLMs on our benchmark
reveals that off-the-shelf models struggle to understand satellite imagery. The
open-source remote-sensing VLM EarthDial achieves only 0.07 SPIDEr in
captioning and a VQA accuracy of 0.48, highlighting the limitations of current
approaches. Encouragingly, lightweight fine-tuning of Qwen2.5-VL-7B on
Landsat30-AU improves captioning performance from 0.11 to 0.31 SPIDEr and
boosts VQA accuracy from \textbf{0.74} to 0.87. Code and data are available at

Result: COFFEE在合成数据和小行星Apophis的渲染数据上表现优于传统方法，速度快于其他深度学习框架。

Conclusion: COFFEE提供了一种高效、无偏的姿态估计解决方案，适用于空间任务。

Abstract: The accurate state estimation of unknown bodies in space is a critical
challenge with applications ranging from the tracking of space debris to the
shape estimation of small bodies. A necessary enabler to this capability is to
find and track features on a continuous stream of images. Existing methods,
such as SIFT, ORB and AKAZE, achieve real-time but inaccurate pose estimates,
whereas modern deep learning methods yield higher quality features at the cost
of more demanding computational resources which might not be available on
space-qualified hardware. Additionally, both classical and data-driven methods
are not robust to the highly opaque self-cast shadows on the object of
interest. We show that, as the target body rotates, these shadows may lead to
large biases in the resulting pose estimates. For these objects, a bias in the
real-time pose estimation algorithm may mislead the spacecraft's state
estimator and cause a mission failure, especially if the body undergoes a
chaotic tumbling motion. We present COFFEE, the Celestial Occlusion Fast
FEature Extractor, a real-time pose estimation framework for asteroids designed
to leverage prior information on the sun phase angle given by sun-tracking
sensors commonly available onboard spacecraft. By associating salient contours
to their projected shadows, a sparse set of features are detected, invariant to
the motion of the shadows. A Sparse Neural Network followed by an
attention-based Graph Neural Network feature matching model are then jointly
trained to provide a set of correspondences between successive frames. The
resulting pose estimation pipeline is found to be bias-free, more accurate than
classical pose estimation pipelines and an order of magnitude faster than other
state-of-the-art deep learning pipelines on synthetic data as well as on
renderings of the tumbling asteroid Apophis.

Abstract: Fire scene datasets are crucial for training robust computer vision models,
particularly in tasks such as fire early warning and emergency rescue
operations. However, among the currently available fire-related data, there is
a significant shortage of annotated data specifically targeting building
units.To tackle this issue, we introduce an annotated dataset of building units
captured by drones, which incorporates multiple enhancement techniques. We
construct backgrounds using real multi-story scenes, combine motion blur and
brightness adjustment to enhance the authenticity of the captured images,
simulate drone shooting conditions under various circumstances, and employ
large models to generate fire effects at different locations.The synthetic
dataset generated by this method encompasses a wide range of building
scenarios, with a total of 1,978 images. This dataset can effectively improve
the generalization ability of fire unit detection, providing multi-scenario and
scalable data while reducing the risks and costs associated with collecting
real fire data. The dataset is available at

Result: 基于BLIP3-o实现的方法在GEdit-Bench基准测试中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: UniEdit-I为统一VLM提供了一种无需训练的高保真图像编辑解决方案，展示了未来发展的潜力。

Abstract: In recent years, unified vision-language models (VLMs) have rapidly advanced,
effectively tackling both visual understanding and generation tasks within a
single design. While many unified VLMs have explored various design choices,
the recent hypothesis from OpenAI's GPT-4o suggests a promising generation
pipeline: Understanding VLM->Visual Feature->Projector->Diffusion Model->Image.
The understanding VLM is frozen, and only the generation-related modules are
trained. This pipeline maintains the strong capability of understanding VLM
while enabling the image generation ability of the unified VLM. Although this
pipeline has shown very promising potential for the future development of
unified VLM, how to easily enable image editing capability is still unexplored.
In this paper, we introduce a novel training-free framework named UniEdit-I to
enable the unified VLM with image editing capability via three iterative steps:
understanding, editing, and verifying. 1. The understanding step analyzes the
source image to create a source prompt through structured semantic analysis and
makes minimal word replacements to form the target prompt based on the editing
instruction. 2. The editing step introduces a time-adaptive offset, allowing
for coherent editing from coarse to fine throughout the denoising process. 3.
The verification step checks the alignment between the target prompt and the
intermediate edited image, provides automatic consistency scores and corrective
feedback, and determines whether to stop early or continue the editing loop.
This understanding, editing, and verifying loop iterates until convergence,
delivering high-fidelity editing in a training-free manner. We implemented our
method based on the latest BLIP3-o and achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance on the GEdit-Bench benchmark.

Result: 在MVTec-AD和BTAD数据集上，SARD在分割精度和视觉质量上超越现有方法，达到新最优。

Conclusion: SARD为像素级异常合成设定了新标准，显著提升了工业异常检测的实用性。

Abstract: Synthesizing realistic and spatially precise anomalies is essential for
enhancing the robustness of industrial anomaly detection systems. While recent
diffusion-based methods have demonstrated strong capabilities in modeling
complex defect patterns, they often struggle with spatial controllability and
fail to maintain fine-grained regional fidelity. To overcome these limitations,
we propose SARD (Segmentation-Aware anomaly synthesis via Region-constrained
Diffusion with discriminative mask Guidance), a novel diffusion-based framework
specifically designed for anomaly generation. Our approach introduces a
Region-Constrained Diffusion (RCD) process that preserves the background by
freezing it and selectively updating only the foreground anomaly regions during
the reverse denoising phase, thereby effectively reducing background artifacts.
Additionally, we incorporate a Discriminative Mask Guidance (DMG) module into
the discriminator, enabling joint evaluation of both global realism and local
anomaly fidelity, guided by pixel-level masks. Extensive experiments on the
MVTec-AD and BTAD datasets show that SARD surpasses existing methods in
segmentation accuracy and visual quality, setting a new state-of-the-art for
pixel-level anomaly synthesis.

Abstract: The exponential growth in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) usage underscores
the critical need of detecting them at extended distances to ensure safe
operations, especially in densely populated areas. Despite the tremendous
advances made in computer vision through deep learning, the detection of these
small airborne objects remains a formidable challenge. While several datasets
have been developed specifically for drone detection, the need for a more
extensive and diverse collection of drone image data persists, particularly for
long-range detection under varying environmental conditions. We introduce here
the Long Range Drone Detection (LRDD) Version 2 dataset, comprising 39,516
meticulously annotated images, as a second release of the LRDD dataset released
previously. The LRDDv2 dataset enhances the LRDDv1 by incorporating a greater
variety of images, providing a more diverse and comprehensive resource for
drone detection research. What sets LRDDv2 apart is its inclusion of target
range information for over 8,000 images, making it possible to develop
algorithms for drone range estimation. Tailored for long-range aerial object
detection, the majority of LRDDv2's dataset consists of images capturing drones
with 50 or fewer pixels in 1080p resolution. For access to the complete

through natural language instructions, and is widely applied to tasks such as
semantic object replacement, insertion, and removal. While recent
inversion-based editing methods using rectified flow models have achieved
promising results in image quality, we identify a structural limitation in
their editing behavior: the semantic bias toward the source concept encoded in
the inverted noise tends to suppress attention to the target concept. This
issue becomes particularly critical when the source and target semantics are
dissimilar, where the attention mechanism inherently leads to editing failure
or unintended modifications in non-target regions. In this paper, we
systematically analyze and validate this structural flaw, and introduce LORE, a
training-free and efficient image editing method. LORE directly optimizes the
inverted noise, addressing the core limitations in generalization and
controllability of existing approaches, enabling stable, controllable, and
general-purpose concept replacement, without requiring architectural
modification or model fine-tuning. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on
three challenging benchmarks: PIEBench, SmartEdit, and GapEdit. Experimental
results show that LORE significantly outperforms strong baselines in terms of
semantic alignment, image quality, and background fidelity, demonstrating the
effectiveness and scalability of latent-space optimization for general-purpose
image editing.

TL;DR: OmniShape是一种新方法，通过解耦形状补全为两个多模态分布，实现单次观测下的物体姿态和形状概率估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究目的是从单次观测中估计物体的姿态和完整形状，无需已知3D模型或类别。

Method: OmniShape将形状补全解耦为两个多模态分布：一个捕捉测量在标准化参考帧中的投影，另一个建模物体几何的先验。通过训练两个条件扩散模型，实现姿态和形状的联合分布采样。

Result: OmniShape在真实数据集上表现出色。

Conclusion: OmniShape是首个实现概率姿态和形状估计的方法，性能优异。

Abstract: We would like to estimate the pose and full shape of an object from a single
observation, without assuming known 3D model or category. In this work, we
propose OmniShape, the first method of its kind to enable probabilistic pose
and shape estimation. OmniShape is based on the key insight that shape
completion can be decoupled into two multi-modal distributions: one capturing
how measurements project into a normalized object reference frame defined by
the dataset and the other modelling a prior over object geometries represented
as triplanar neural fields. By training separate conditional diffusion models
for these two distributions, we enable sampling multiple hypotheses from the
joint pose and shape distribution. OmniShape demonstrates compelling
performance on challenging real world datasets. Project website:

TL;DR: ChartCap是一个包含56.5万张真实图表图像的数据集，通过四阶段流程生成高质量、无幻觉的图表描述，并提出新的视觉一致性评分指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图表数据集存在无关信息和结构元素不足的问题，需要高质量数据集来提升图表描述的准确性。

Method: 设计四阶段流程生成密集描述，采用循环一致性人工验证，并提出视觉一致性评分指标。

Result: 实验表明，基于ChartCap微调的模型生成的描述更准确、信息更丰富，优于开源、专有模型及人工标注。

Conclusion: ChartCap通过高质量数据集和新指标，显著提升了图表描述的质量和准确性。

Abstract: Generating accurate, informative, and hallucination-free captions for charts
remains challenging for vision language models, primarily due to the lack of
large-scale, high-quality datasets of real-world charts. However, existing
real-world chart datasets suffer from the inclusion of extraneous information
that cannot be inferred from the chart and failure to sufficiently capture
structural elements and key insights. Therefore, we introduce ChartCap, a
large-scale dataset of 565K real-world chart images paired with type-specific,
dense captions that exclude extraneous information and highlight both
structural elements and key insights in detail. To build ChartCap, we design a
four-stage pipeline that generates captions using only the discernible data
from the chart and employ a cycle consistency-based human verification, which
accelerates quality control without sacrificing accuracy. Additionally, we
propose a novel metric, the Visual Consistency Score, which evaluates caption
quality by measuring the similarity between the chart regenerated from a
caption and the original chart, independent of reference captions. Extensive
experiments confirms that models fine-tuned on ChartCap consistently generate
more accurate and informative captions with reduced hallucinations, surpassing
both open-source and proprietary models and even human-annotated captions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Veila提出了一种基于条件扩散框架的方法，通过RGB图像生成可控的全景LiDAR数据，解决了现有方法在可控性和模态对齐上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在生成全景LiDAR数据时，要么缺乏可控性，要么依赖文本引导而缺乏细粒度空间控制。利用单目RGB图像作为控制信号是一种低成本且可扩展的替代方案，但仍面临语义深度不一致、模态对齐误差和结构一致性等挑战。

Method: Veila框架包含三个核心组件：置信感知条件机制（CACM）平衡语义和深度线索；几何跨模态对齐（GCMA）增强RGB-LiDAR对齐；全景特征一致性（PFC）确保全局结构一致性。

Result: 在nuScenes、SemanticKITTI和KITTI-Weather基准测试中，Veila实现了最先进的生成保真度和跨模态一致性，并能通过生成数据增强提升下游LiDAR语义分割性能。

Conclusion: Veila通过创新的条件扩散框架，有效解决了RGB到LiDAR数据生成中的核心挑战，为自动驾驶和机器人领域的3D感知提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Realistic and controllable panoramic LiDAR data generation is critical for
scalable 3D perception in autonomous driving and robotics. Existing methods
either perform unconditional generation with poor controllability or adopt
text-guided synthesis, which lacks fine-grained spatial control. Leveraging a
monocular RGB image as a spatial control signal offers a scalable and low-cost
alternative, which remains an open problem. However, it faces three core
challenges: (i) semantic and depth cues from RGB are vary spatially,
complicating reliable conditioning generation; (ii) modality gaps between RGB
appearance and LiDAR geometry amplify alignment errors under noisy diffusion;
and (iii) maintaining structural coherence between monocular RGB and panoramic
LiDAR is challenging, particularly in non-overlap regions between images and
LiDAR. To address these challenges, we propose Veila, a novel conditional
diffusion framework that integrates: a Confidence-Aware Conditioning Mechanism
(CACM) that strengthens RGB conditioning by adaptively balancing semantic and
depth cues according to their local reliability; a Geometric Cross-Modal
Alignment (GCMA) for robust RGB-LiDAR alignment under noisy diffusion; and a
Panoramic Feature Coherence (PFC) for enforcing global structural consistency
across monocular RGB and panoramic LiDAR. Additionally, we introduce two
metrics, Cross-Modal Semantic Consistency and Cross-Modal Depth Consistency, to
evaluate alignment quality across modalities. Experiments on nuScenes,
SemanticKITTI, and our proposed KITTI-Weather benchmark demonstrate that Veila
achieves state-of-the-art generation fidelity and cross-modal consistency,
while enabling generative data augmentation that improves downstream LiDAR
semantic segmentation.

Motivation: 尽管LVLMs在复杂视觉文本理解上取得突破，但幻觉问题限制了其实际应用，尤其是在风格化图像中。

Method: 构建了包含摄影图像及其风格化版本的数据集，提出SAVER机制，通过动态调整输出减少幻觉。

Result: 风格化图像比摄影图像更容易引发幻觉，SAVER在多种任务和数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: SAVER能有效减少风格化图像引发的幻觉，提升LVLMs的实际适用性。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) recently achieve significant
breakthroughs in understanding complex visual-textual contexts. However,
hallucination issues still limit their real-world applicability. Although
previous mitigation methods effectively reduce hallucinations in photographic
images, they largely overlook the potential risks posed by stylized images,
which play crucial roles in critical scenarios such as game scene
understanding, art education, and medical analysis. In this work, we first
construct a dataset comprising photographic images and their corresponding
stylized versions with carefully annotated caption labels. We then conduct
head-to-head comparisons on both discriminative and generative tasks by
benchmarking 13 advanced LVLMs on the collected datasets. Our findings reveal
that stylized images tend to induce significantly more hallucinations than
their photographic counterparts. To address this issue, we propose Style-Aware
Visual Early Revision SAVER, a novel mechanism that dynamically adjusts LVLMs'
final outputs based on the token-level visual attention patterns, leveraging
early-layer feedback to mitigate hallucinations caused by stylized images.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAVER achieves state-of-the-art
performance in hallucination mitigation across various models, datasets, and
tasks.

Result: La La LiDAR在LiDAR生成和下游感知任务中达到最先进性能，并提出了新的评估指标。

Conclusion: 该模型为可控3D场景生成设立了新基准，适用于自动驾驶和机器人等领域。

Abstract: Controllable generation of realistic LiDAR scenes is crucial for applications
such as autonomous driving and robotics. While recent diffusion-based models
achieve high-fidelity LiDAR generation, they lack explicit control over
foreground objects and spatial relationships, limiting their usefulness for
scenario simulation and safety validation. To address these limitations, we
propose Large-scale Layout-guided LiDAR generation model ("La La LiDAR"), a
novel layout-guided generative framework that introduces semantic-enhanced
scene graph diffusion with relation-aware contextual conditioning for
structured LiDAR layout generation, followed by foreground-aware control
injection for complete scene generation. This enables customizable control over
object placement while ensuring spatial and semantic consistency. To support
our structured LiDAR generation, we introduce Waymo-SG and nuScenes-SG, two
large-scale LiDAR scene graph datasets, along with new evaluation metrics for
layout synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that La La LiDAR achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both LiDAR generation and downstream perception
tasks, establishing a new benchmark for controllable 3D scene generation.

Abstract: Generative world models have become essential data engines for autonomous
driving, yet most existing efforts focus on videos or occupancy grids,
overlooking the unique LiDAR properties. Extending LiDAR generation to dynamic
4D world modeling presents challenges in controllability, temporal coherence,
and evaluation standardization. To this end, we present LiDARCrafter, a unified
framework for 4D LiDAR generation and editing. Given free-form natural language
inputs, we parse instructions into ego-centric scene graphs, which condition a
tri-branch diffusion network to generate object structures, motion
trajectories, and geometry. These structured conditions enable diverse and
fine-grained scene editing. Additionally, an autoregressive module generates
temporally coherent 4D LiDAR sequences with smooth transitions. To support
standardized evaluation, we establish a comprehensive benchmark with diverse
metrics spanning scene-, object-, and sequence-level aspects. Experiments on
the nuScenes dataset using this benchmark demonstrate that LiDARCrafter
achieves state-of-the-art performance in fidelity, controllability, and
temporal consistency across all levels, paving the way for data augmentation

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D高斯泼溅方法依赖计算成本高的顺序alpha混合操作，导致资源受限平台上的性能瓶颈。

Method: 提出Duplex-GS框架，结合代理高斯表示和顺序无关渲染技术，引入单元代理和单元搜索光栅化以加速。

Result: 实验显示，Duplex-GS在质量和效率上均有显著提升，速度提升1.5至4倍，排序开销减少52.2%至86.9%。

Conclusion: Duplex-GS验证了顺序无关渲染在高斯泼溅中的优势，实现了高质量实时渲染。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated remarkable
rendering fidelity and efficiency. However, these methods still rely on
computationally expensive sequential alpha-blending operations, resulting in
significant overhead, particularly on resource-constrained platforms. In this
paper, we propose Duplex-GS, a dual-hierarchy framework that integrates proxy
Gaussian representations with order-independent rendering techniques to achieve
photorealistic results while sustaining real-time performance. To mitigate the
overhead caused by view-adaptive radix sort, we introduce cell proxies for
local Gaussians management and propose cell search rasterization for further
acceleration. By seamlessly combining our framework with Order-Independent
Transparency (OIT), we develop a physically inspired weighted sum rendering
technique that simultaneously eliminates "popping" and "transparency"
artifacts, yielding substantial improvements in both accuracy and efficiency.
Extensive experiments on a variety of real-world datasets demonstrate the
robustness of our method across diverse scenarios, including multi-scale
training views and large-scale environments. Our results validate the
advantages of the OIT rendering paradigm in Gaussian Splatting, achieving
high-quality rendering with an impressive 1.5 to 4 speedup over existing OIT
based Gaussian Splatting approaches and 52.2% to 86.9% reduction of the radix
sort overhead without quality degradation.

Motivation: 单目深度估计因从单视图恢复3D结构的病态性而具有挑战性，需解决多解问题。

Result: 在NYU-V2和KITTI数据集上表现优异，超越现有方法。

Conclusion: GLKAM和GBPM模块显著提升了深度估计的准确性。

Abstract: Accurate monocular depth estimation remains a challenging problem due to the
inherent ambiguity that stems from the ill-posed nature of recovering 3D
structure from a single view, where multiple plausible depth configurations can
produce identical 2D projections. In this paper, we present a novel depth
estimation method that combines both local and global cues to improve
prediction accuracy. Specifically, we propose the Gated Large Kernel Attention
Module (GLKAM) to effectively capture multi-scale local structural information
by leveraging large kernel convolutions with a gated mechanism. To further
enhance the global perception of the network, we introduce the Global Bin
Prediction Module (GBPM), which estimates the global distribution of depth bins
and provides structural guidance for depth regression. Extensive experiments on
the NYU-V2 and KITTI dataset demonstrate that our method achieves competitive
performance and outperforms existing approaches, validating the effectiveness
of each proposed component.

Motivation: 人脸伪造技术的快速发展要求检测器持续适应新的伪造方法，但现有方法在学习新任务时会出现灾难性遗忘问题。KAN因其局部可塑性理论上适合解决这一问题，但在高维图像建模和特征重叠时存在局限性。

Method: 提出KAN-CFD框架，包括域组KAN检测器（DG-KD）和无数据回放特征分离策略（FS-KDCP）。DG-KD使KAN适应高维图像输入并保持局部可塑性，FS-KDCP避免输入空间重叠。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在减少遗忘的同时实现了优越的性能。

Conclusion: KAN-CFD框架有效解决了KAN在持续学习中的局限性，为持续人脸伪造检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: The rapid advancements in face forgery techniques necessitate that detectors
continuously adapt to new forgery methods, thus situating face forgery
detection within a continual learning paradigm. However, when detectors learn
new forgery types, their performance on previous types often degrades rapidly,
a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting. Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks
(KANs) utilize locally plastic splines as their activation functions, enabling
them to learn new tasks by modifying only local regions of the functions while
leaving other areas unaffected. Therefore, they are naturally suitable for
addressing catastrophic forgetting. However, KANs have two significant
limitations: 1) the splines are ineffective for modeling high-dimensional
images, while alternative activation functions that are suitable for images
lack the essential property of locality; 2) in continual learning, when
features from different domains overlap, the mapping of different domains to
distinct curve regions always collapses due to repeated modifications of the
same regions. In this paper, we propose a KAN-based Continual Face Forgery
Detection (KAN-CFD) framework, which includes a Domain-Group KAN Detector
(DG-KD) and a data-free replay Feature Separation strategy via KAN Drift
Compensation Projection (FS-KDCP). DG-KD enables KANs to fit high-dimensional
image inputs while preserving locality and local plasticity. FS-KDCP avoids the
overlap of the KAN input spaces without using data from prior tasks.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior
performance while notably reducing forgetting.

<details>

Motivation: 由于CNV形状不规则、成像限制（如投影伪影、噪声和边界模糊）以及缺乏公开数据集，现有方法在CNV分割中存在挑战。

Method: MTG-Net通过多任务框架和两个基于图的跨任务模块（MIGR和MRGR）整合区域和血管形态信息，利用图机制推理任务间的高阶关系，并提出不确定性加权损失以减少伪影和噪声的影响。

Result: 实验表明，MTG-Net在区域分割和血管分割中分别达到87.21%和88.12%的Dice分数，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MTG-Net通过多边图卷积交互和不确定性加权损失，显著提升了CNV分割的准确性，为wet AMD的临床评估提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Choroidal neovascularization (CNV), a primary characteristic of wet
age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD), represents a leading cause of
blindness worldwide. In clinical practice, optical coherence tomography
angiography (OCTA) is commonly used for studying CNV-related pathological
changes, due to its micron-level resolution and non-invasive nature. Thus,
accurate segmentation of CNV regions and vessels in OCTA images is crucial for
clinical assessment of wet AMD. However, challenges existed due to irregular
CNV shapes and imaging limitations like projection artifacts, noises and
boundary blurring. Moreover, the lack of publicly available datasets
constraints the CNV analysis. To address these challenges, this paper
constructs the first publicly accessible CNV dataset (CNVSeg), and proposes a
novel multilateral graph convolutional interaction-enhanced CNV segmentation
network (MTG-Net). This network integrates both region and vessel morphological
information, exploring semantic and geometric duality constraints within the
graph domain. Specifically, MTG-Net consists of a multi-task framework and two
graph-based cross-task modules: Multilateral Interaction Graph Reasoning (MIGR)
and Multilateral Reinforcement Graph Reasoning (MRGR). The multi-task framework
encodes rich geometric features of lesion shapes and surfaces, decoupling the
image into three task-specific feature maps. MIGR and MRGR iteratively reason
about higher-order relationships across tasks through a graph mechanism,
enabling complementary optimization for task-specific objectives. Additionally,
an uncertainty-weighted loss is proposed to mitigate the impact of artifacts
and noise on segmentation accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that
MTG-Net outperforms existing methods, achieving a Dice socre of 87.21\% for
region segmentation and 88.12\% for vessel segmentation.

Motivation: 现有方法在区分文本表达中的细微语义差异时缺乏跨模态推理能力，尤其是类别和属性模糊性带来的挑战。

Method: 提出AlignCAT框架，包含粗粒度对齐模块（利用类别信息和全局上下文）和细粒度对齐模块（利用描述信息和词级文本特征）。

Result: 在RefCOCO、RefCOCO+和RefCOCOg三个基准测试中表现优于现有弱监督方法。

Conclusion: AlignCAT通过充分利用语言线索，逐步过滤未对齐的视觉查询，提升了对比学习效率，解决了VG中的语义模糊问题。

Abstract: Weakly supervised visual grounding (VG) aims to locate objects in images
based on text descriptions. Despite significant progress, existing methods lack
strong cross-modal reasoning to distinguish subtle semantic differences in text
expressions due to category-based and attribute-based ambiguity. To address
these challenges, we introduce AlignCAT, a novel query-based semantic matching
framework for weakly supervised VG. To enhance visual-linguistic alignment, we
propose a coarse-grained alignment module that utilizes category information
and global context, effectively mitigating interference from
category-inconsistent objects. Subsequently, a fine-grained alignment module
leverages descriptive information and captures word-level text features to
achieve attribute consistency. By exploiting linguistic cues to their fullest
extent, our proposed AlignCAT progressively filters out misaligned visual
queries and enhances contrastive learning efficiency. Extensive experiments on
three VG benchmarks, namely RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg, verify the
superiority of AlignCAT against existing weakly supervised methods on two VG
tasks. Our code is available at: https://github.com/I2-Multimedia-Lab/AlignCAT.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为INP-CC的开放词汇HOI检测方法，通过交互感知提示和概念校准提升检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖视觉语言模型，但图像级预训练与细粒度区域级交互检测不匹配，且文本描述编码效果不佳。

Method: 设计了交互感知提示生成器和语言模型引导的概念校准，结合负采样策略优化跨模态相似性建模。

Result: 在SWIG-HOI和HICO-DET数据集上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: INP-CC通过动态提示和概念校准有效提升了开放词汇HOI检测性能。

Abstract: Open Vocabulary Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection aims to detect
interactions between humans and objects while generalizing to novel interaction
classes beyond the training set. Current methods often rely on Vision and
Language Models (VLMs) but face challenges due to suboptimal image encoders, as
image-level pre-training does not align well with the fine-grained region-level
interaction detection required for HOI. Additionally, effectively encoding
textual descriptions of visual appearances remains difficult, limiting the
model's ability to capture detailed HOI relationships. To address these issues,
we propose INteraction-aware Prompting with Concept Calibration (INP-CC), an
end-to-end open-vocabulary HOI detector that integrates interaction-aware
prompts and concept calibration. Specifically, we propose an interaction-aware
prompt generator that dynamically generates a compact set of prompts based on
the input scene, enabling selective sharing among similar interactions. This
approach directs the model's attention to key interaction patterns rather than
generic image-level semantics, enhancing HOI detection. Furthermore, we refine
HOI concept representations through language model-guided calibration, which
helps distinguish diverse HOI concepts by investigating visual similarities
across categories. A negative sampling strategy is also employed to improve
inter-modal similarity modeling, enabling the model to better differentiate
visually similar but semantically distinct actions. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that INP-CC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
models on the SWIG-HOI and HICO-DET datasets. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如FreeInit通过迭代优化噪声实现时间一致性，但计算成本高。FastInit旨在解决这一问题。

Method: FastInit训练了一个视频噪声预测网络（VNPNet），通过单次前向传播生成优化后的噪声，无需迭代。

Result: 实验表明，FastInit显著提升了生成视频的质量和时间一致性，且计算成本低。

Conclusion: FastInit为视频生成提供了一种高效且实用的解决方案，可直接应用于推理阶段。

Abstract: Video generation has made significant strides with the development of
diffusion models; however, achieving high temporal consistency remains a
challenging task. Recently, FreeInit identified a training-inference gap and
introduced a method to iteratively refine the initial noise during inference.
However, iterative refinement significantly increases the computational cost
associated with video generation. In this paper, we introduce FastInit, a fast
noise initialization method that eliminates the need for iterative refinement.
FastInit learns a Video Noise Prediction Network (VNPNet) that takes random
noise and a text prompt as input, generating refined noise in a single forward
pass. Therefore, FastInit greatly enhances the efficiency of video generation
while achieving high temporal consistency across frames. To train the VNPNet,
we create a large-scale dataset consisting of pairs of text prompts, random
noise, and refined noise. Extensive experiments with various text-to-video
models show that our method consistently improves the quality and temporal
consistency of the generated videos. FastInit not only provides a substantial
improvement in video generation but also offers a practical solution that can
be applied directly during inference. The code and dataset will be released.

*Xinwei Liu,Xiaojun Jia,Yuan Xun,Simeng Qin,Xiaochun Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoShield是一种新型对抗框架，旨在保护地理隐私，通过特征解耦、暴露元素识别和尺度自适应增强模块，有效抵御高级视觉语言模型的地理位置推断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高级视觉语言模型（如GPT-4o）能够从公开共享的图像中推断用户位置，对地理隐私构成重大威胁，现有对抗扰动方法在高分辨率图像和低扰动预算下表现不佳。

Method: GeoShield包含三个模块：特征解耦模块分离地理和非地理信息，暴露元素识别模块定位图像中的地理揭示区域，尺度自适应增强模块联合优化全局和局部扰动。

Result: 在挑战性基准测试中，GeoShield在黑盒设置下优于现有方法，提供强隐私保护且对视觉或语义质量影响最小。

Conclusion: GeoShield是首个探索对抗扰动以防御高级视觉语言模型地理位置推断的工作，为解决日益增长的隐私问题提供了实用有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as GPT-4o now demonstrate a remarkable
ability to infer users' locations from public shared images, posing a
substantial risk to geoprivacy. Although adversarial perturbations offer a
potential defense, current methods are ill-suited for this scenario: they often
perform poorly on high-resolution images and low perturbation budgets, and may
introduce irrelevant semantic content. To address these limitations, we propose
GeoShield, a novel adversarial framework designed for robust geoprivacy
protection in real-world scenarios. GeoShield comprises three key modules: a
feature disentanglement module that separates geographical and non-geographical
information, an exposure element identification module that pinpoints
geo-revealing regions within an image, and a scale-adaptive enhancement module
that jointly optimizes perturbations at both global and local levels to ensure
effectiveness across resolutions. Extensive experiments on challenging
benchmarks show that GeoShield consistently surpasses prior methods in
black-box settings, achieving strong privacy protection with minimal impact on
visual or semantic quality. To our knowledge, this work is the first to explore
adversarial perturbations for defending against geolocation inference by
advanced VLMs, providing a practical and effective solution to escalating
privacy concerns.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为UAA的高效对抗防御框架，通过预计算通用变换来提升模型鲁棒性，避免了训练时的高计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗性扰动对深度学习模型构成威胁，现有防御方法如对抗训练（AT）计算成本高且影响标准性能，数据增强技术效果有限或训练开销大。

Method: 提出Universal Adversarial Augmenter（UAA）框架，通过离线预计算通用变换，在训练时高效生成独特对抗扰动。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，UAA实现了数据增强对抗防御策略的新SOTA，无需在线生成对抗样本。

Conclusion: UAA为构建鲁棒模型提供了高效实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Adversarial perturbations pose a significant threat to deep learning models.
Adversarial Training (AT), the predominant defense method, faces challenges of
high computational costs and a degradation in standard performance. While data
augmentation offers an alternative path, existing techniques either yield
limited robustness gains or incur substantial training overhead. Therefore,
developing a defense mechanism that is both highly efficient and strongly
robust is of paramount importance.In this work, we first conduct a systematic
analysis of existing augmentation techniques, revealing that the synergy among
diverse strategies -- rather than any single method -- is crucial for enhancing
robustness. Based on this insight, we propose the Universal Adversarial
Augmenter (UAA) framework, which is characterized by its plug-and-play nature
and training efficiency. UAA decouples the expensive perturbation generation
process from model training by pre-computing a universal transformation
offline, which is then used to efficiently generate unique adversarial
perturbations for each sample during training.Extensive experiments conducted
on multiple benchmarks validate the effectiveness of UAA. The results
demonstrate that UAA establishes a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) for
data-augmentation-based adversarial defense strategies , without requiring the
online generation of adversarial examples during training. This framework
provides a practical and efficient pathway for building robust models,Our code
is available in the supplementary materials.

### [165] [ActionSink: Toward Precise Robot Manipulation with Dynamic Integration of Action Flow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03218)
*Shanshan Guo,Xiwen Liang,Junfan Lin,Yuzheng Zhuang,Liang Lin,Xiaodan Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为ActionSink的新型机器人操作框架，通过将机器人动作重新定义为自监督的“动作流”，并结合粗到细的匹配和动态整合模块，显著提升了动作估计的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低级别动作估计的低精度是机器人操作性能的主要限制因素，本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: ActionSink框架包含两个模块：1) 粗到细的动作流匹配器，通过迭代检索和去噪提高精度；2) 动态动作流整合器，利用工作记忆池管理历史动作流，并通过多层融合模块整合当前和历史的动作流。

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试中，ActionSink比现有最佳方法提高了7.9%的成功率，在LIBERO-Long任务中提升了近8%的准确率。

Conclusion: ActionSink通过自监督的动作流和动态整合机制，显著提升了机器人操作中的动作估计精度。

Abstract: Language-instructed robot manipulation has garnered significant interest due
to the potential of learning from collected data. While the challenges in
high-level perception and planning are continually addressed along the progress
of general large pre-trained models, the low precision of low-level action
estimation has emerged as the key limiting factor in manipulation performance.
To this end, this paper introduces a novel robot manipulation framework, i.e.,
ActionSink, to pave the way toward precise action estimations in the field of
learning-based robot manipulation. As the name suggests, ActionSink
reformulates the actions of robots as action-caused optical flows from videos,
called "action flow", in a self-supervised manner, which are then used to be
retrieved and integrated to enhance the action estimation. Specifically,
ActionSink incorporates two primary modules. The first module is a
coarse-to-fine action flow matcher, which continuously refines the accuracy of
action flow via iterative retrieval and denoising process. The second module is
a dynamic action flow integrator, which employs a working memory pool that
dynamically and efficiently manages the historical action flows that should be
used to integrate to enhance the current action estimation. In this module, a
multi-layer fusion module is proposed to integrate direct estimation and action
flows from both the current and the working memory, achieving highly accurate
action estimation through a series of estimation-integration processes. Our
ActionSink framework outperformed prior SOTA on the LIBERO benchmark by a 7.9\%
success rate, and obtained nearly an 8\% accuracy gain on the challenging
long-horizon visual task LIBERO-Long.

TL;DR: 论文提出Gaussian Instance Tracing (GIT)方法，通过增强高斯表示和自适应密度控制，解决2D到3D分割中的不一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在2D到3D分割中存在视角间不一致和边界噪声问题，忽略了语义线索对高斯学习的优化作用。

Method: 引入实例权重矩阵和GIT引导的自适应密度控制机制，修正2D分割不一致性并优化高斯分布。

Result: 实验表明，GIT能提取干净的3D资产，并在多种场景下提升3D分割效果。

Conclusion: GIT方法显著改善了2D和3D分割的一致性，支持分层分割、对象提取和场景编辑等应用。

Abstract: We address the challenge of lifting 2D visual segmentation to 3D in Gaussian
Splatting. Existing methods often suffer from inconsistent 2D masks across
viewpoints and produce noisy segmentation boundaries as they neglect these
semantic cues to refine the learned Gaussians. To overcome this, we introduce
Gaussian Instance Tracing (GIT), which augments the standard Gaussian
representation with an instance weight matrix across input views. Leveraging
the inherent consistency of Gaussians in 3D, we use this matrix to identify and
correct 2D segmentation inconsistencies. Furthermore, since each Gaussian
ideally corresponds to a single object, we propose a GIT-guided adaptive
density control mechanism to split and prune ambiguous Gaussians during
training, resulting in sharper and more coherent 2D and 3D segmentation
boundaries. Experimental results show that our method extracts clean 3D assets
and consistently improves 3D segmentation in both online (e.g., self-prompting)
and offline (e.g., contrastive lifting) settings, enabling applications such as
hierarchical segmentation, object extraction, and scene editing.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient characterization of nanoparticle morphology in
Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images is critical for ensuring product
quality in nanomaterial synthesis and accelerating development. However,
conventional deep learning methods for shape classification require extensive
labeled datasets and computationally demanding training, limiting their
accessibility to the typical nanoparticle practitioner in research and
industrial settings. In this study, we introduce a zero-shot classification
pipeline that leverages two vision foundation models: the Segment Anything
Model (SAM) for object segmentation and DINOv2 for feature embedding. By
combining these models with a lightweight classifier, we achieve high-precision
shape classification across three morphologically diverse nanoparticle datasets
- without the need for extensive parameter fine-tuning. Our methodology
outperforms a fine-tuned YOLOv11 and ChatGPT o4-mini-high baselines,
demonstrating robustness to small datasets, subtle morphological variations,
and domain shifts from natural to scientific imaging. Quantitative clustering
metrics on PCA plots of the DINOv2 features are discussed as a means of
assessing the progress of the chemical synthesis. This work highlights the
potential of foundation models to advance automated microscopy image analysis,
offering an alternative to traditional deep learning pipelines in nanoparticle
research which is both more efficient and more accessible to the user.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有化妆数据集收集困难，合成方法存在失真或身份不一致问题，亟需高质量配对数据集支持美容相关任务。

Method: 基于FFHQ数据集，改进化妆转移方法，解耦身份与化妆风格，生成18K身份各配5种化妆风格的90K图像对。

Result: 构建了FFHQ-Makeup数据集，包含90K高质量配对图像，解决了现有方法的不足。

Conclusion: FFHQ-Makeup填补了高质量化妆数据集的空白，为美容相关研究提供了宝贵资源。

Abstract: Paired bare-makeup facial images are essential for a wide range of
beauty-related tasks, such as virtual try-on, facial privacy protection, and
facial aesthetics analysis. However, collecting high-quality paired makeup
datasets remains a significant challenge. Real-world data acquisition is
constrained by the difficulty of collecting large-scale paired images, while
existing synthetic approaches often suffer from limited realism or
inconsistencies between bare and makeup images. Current synthetic methods
typically fall into two categories: warping-based transformations, which often
distort facial geometry and compromise the precision of makeup; and
text-to-image generation, which tends to alter facial identity and expression,
undermining consistency. In this work, we present FFHQ-Makeup, a high-quality
synthetic makeup dataset that pairs each identity with multiple makeup styles
while preserving facial consistency in both identity and expression. Built upon
the diverse FFHQ dataset, our pipeline transfers real-world makeup styles from
existing datasets onto 18K identities by introducing an improved makeup
transfer method that disentangles identity and makeup. Each identity is paired
with 5 different makeup styles, resulting in a total of 90K high-quality
bare-makeup image pairs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work
that focuses specifically on constructing a makeup dataset. We hope that
FFHQ-Makeup fills the gap of lacking high-quality bare-makeup paired datasets
and serves as a valuable resource for future research in beauty-related tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MVTOP是一种基于Transformer的多视角刚性物体姿态估计方法，通过早期融合视角特征解决单视角无法解决的姿态模糊问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单视角或后处理单视角姿态无法解决的多视角姿态模糊问题。

Method: 通过视线融合多视角几何信息，假设相机内参和相对方向已知，但每次推理可以变化。

Result: 在合成数据集和YCB-V数据集上优于单视角和其他多视角方法。

Conclusion: MVTOP是首个能可靠解决此类姿态模糊问题的端到端可训练多视角方法，无需额外数据。

Abstract: We present MVTOP, a novel transformer-based method for multi-view rigid
object pose estimation. Through an early fusion of the view-specific features,
our method can resolve pose ambiguities that would be impossible to solve with
a single view or with a post-processing of single-view poses. MVTOP models the
multi-view geometry via lines of sight that emanate from the respective camera
centers. While the method assumes the camera interior and relative orientations
are known for a particular scene, they can vary for each inference. This makes
the method versatile. The use of the lines of sight enables MVTOP to correctly
predict the correct pose with the merged multi-view information. To show the
model's capabilities, we provide a synthetic data set that can only be solved
with such holistic multi-view approaches since the poses in the dataset cannot
be solved with just one view. Our method outperforms single-view and all
existing multi-view approaches on our dataset and achieves competitive results
on the YCB-V dataset. To the best of our knowledge, no holistic multi-view
method exists that can resolve such pose ambiguities reliably. Our model is
end-to-end trainable and does not require any additional data, e.g., depth.

Abstract: Event cameras offer unparalleled advantages such as high temporal resolution,
low latency, and high dynamic range. However, their limited spatial resolution
poses challenges for fine-grained perception tasks. In this work, we propose an
ultra-lightweight, stream-based event-to-event super-resolution method based on
Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), designed for real-time deployment on
resource-constrained devices. To further reduce model size, we introduce a
novel Dual-Forward Polarity-Split Event Encoding strategy that decouples
positive and negative events into separate forward paths through a shared SNN.
Furthermore, we propose a Learnable Spatio-temporal Polarity-aware Loss
(LearnSTPLoss) that adaptively balances temporal, spatial, and polarity
consistency using learnable uncertainty-based weights. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method achieves competitive super-resolution performance
on multiple datasets while significantly reducing model size and inference
time. The lightweight design enables embedding the module into event cameras or
using it as an efficient front-end preprocessing for downstream vision tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖多步迭代或预训练扩散先验，效率受限。RSDNet旨在通过单步检测和潜在空间去噪解决这一问题。

Method: RSDNet利用多级去噪自编码器（DAEs）在潜在特征空间学习去噪过程，并引入语义几何条件引导增强稀疏表示。DLF支持单步推理。

Result: 在公开基准测试中，RSDNet表现优于现有方法，达到最先进的检测性能。

Conclusion: RSDNet通过潜在框架和单步检测设计，显著提升了3D目标检测的效率和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have shown success in robust
3D object detection tasks. Existing methods often rely on the score matching
from 3D boxes or pre-trained diffusion priors. However, they typically require
multi-step iterations in inference, which limits efficiency. To address this,
we propose a \textbf{R}obust single-stage fully \textbf{S}parse 3D object
\textbf{D}etection \textbf{Net}work with a Detachable Latent Framework (DLF) of
DDPMs, named RSDNet. Specifically, RSDNet learns the denoising process in
latent feature spaces through lightweight denoising networks like multi-level
denoising autoencoders (DAEs). This enables RSDNet to effectively understand
scene distributions under multi-level perturbations, achieving robust and
reliable detection. Meanwhile, we reformulate the noising and denoising
mechanisms of DDPMs, enabling DLF to construct multi-type and multi-level noise
samples and targets, enhancing RSDNet robustness to multiple perturbations.
Furthermore, a semantic-geometric conditional guidance is introduced to
perceive the object boundaries and shapes, alleviating the center feature
missing problem in sparse representations, enabling RSDNet to perform in a
fully sparse detection pipeline. Moreover, the detachable denoising network
design of DLF enables RSDNet to perform single-step detection in inference,
further enhancing detection efficiency. Extensive experiments on public
benchmarks show that RSDNet can outperform existing methods, achieving
state-of-the-art detection.

Result: 在VideoCrafter2和AnimateDiff模型上分别减少36.2%和67.5%参数，性能保持或超越完整模型。

Conclusion: ReDPO和V.I.P.框架有效实现了高效且高质量的视频生成。

Abstract: With growing interest in deploying text-to-video (T2V) models in
resource-constrained environments, reducing their high computational cost has
become crucial, leading to extensive research on pruning and knowledge
distillation methods while maintaining performance. However, existing
distillation methods primarily rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which
often leads to mode collapse as pruned models with reduced capacity fail to
directly match the teacher's outputs, ultimately resulting in degraded quality.
To address this challenge, we propose an effective distillation method, ReDPO,
that integrates DPO and SFT. Our approach leverages DPO to guide the student
model to focus on recovering only the targeted properties, rather than
passively imitating the teacher, while also utilizing SFT to enhance overall
performance. We additionally propose V.I.P., a novel framework for filtering
and curating high-quality pair datasets, along with a step-by-step online
approach for calibrated training. We validate our method on two leading T2V
models, VideoCrafter2 and AnimateDiff, achieving parameter reduction of 36.2%
and 67.5% each, while maintaining or even surpassing the performance of full
models. Further experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of both ReDPO and
V.I.P. framework in enabling efficient and high-quality video generation. Our

TL;DR: DiffBrush是一种基于扩散的模型，用于生成手写文本行，通过内容解耦风格学习和多尺度内容学习，解决了风格模仿和内容准确性的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注孤立单词，而真实手写文本需要关注单词间关系（如垂直对齐和水平间距），因此生成整行文本更具挑战性和实用性。

Method: DiffBrush采用内容解耦风格学习（通过列和行掩码分离风格与内容）和多尺度内容学习（使用行和单词判别器确保全局连贯性和局部准确性）。

Result: 实验表明，DiffBrush在生成高质量文本行方面表现出色，尤其在风格再现和内容保留方面。

Conclusion: DiffBrush通过创新方法解决了手写文本行生成的复杂问题，为相关领域提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Existing handwritten text generation methods primarily focus on isolated
words. However, realistic handwritten text demands attention not only to
individual words but also to the relationships between them, such as vertical
alignment and horizontal spacing. Therefore, generating entire text lines
emerges as a more promising and comprehensive task. However, this task poses
significant challenges, including the accurate modeling of complex style
patterns encompassing both intra- and inter-word relationships, and maintaining
content accuracy across numerous characters. To address these challenges, we
propose DiffBrush, a novel diffusion-based model for handwritten text-line
generation. Unlike existing methods, DiffBrush excels in both style imitation
and content accuracy through two key strategies: (1) content-decoupled style
learning, which disentangles style from content to better capture intra-word
and inter-word style patterns by using column- and row-wise masking; and (2)
multi-scale content learning, which employs line and word discriminators to
ensure global coherence and local accuracy of textual content. Extensive
experiments show that DiffBrush excels in generating high-quality text lines,
particularly in style reproduction and content preservation. Code is available

Conclusion: EgoPrompt通过增强组件间交互和多样化提示池，显著提升了第一人称动作识别的泛化能力和表现。

Abstract: Driven by the increasing demand for applications in augmented and virtual
reality, egocentric action recognition has emerged as a prominent research
area. It is typically divided into two subtasks: recognizing the performed
behavior (i.e., verb component) and identifying the objects being acted upon
(i.e., noun component) from the first-person perspective. However, most
existing approaches treat these two components as independent classification
tasks, focusing on extracting component-specific knowledge while overlooking
their inherent semantic and contextual relationships, leading to fragmented
representations and sub-optimal generalization capability. To address these
challenges, we propose a prompt learning-based framework, EgoPrompt, to conduct
the egocentric action recognition task. Building on the existing prompting
strategy to capture the component-specific knowledge, we construct a Unified
Prompt Pool space to establish interaction between the two types of component
representations. Specifically, the component representations (from verbs and
nouns) are first decomposed into fine-grained patterns with the prompt pair
form. Then, these pattern-level representations are fused through an
attention-based mechanism to facilitate cross-component interaction. To ensure
the prompt pool is informative, we further introduce a novel training
objective, Diverse Pool Criteria. This objective realizes our goals from two
perspectives: Prompt Selection Frequency Regularization and Prompt Knowledge
Orthogonalization. Extensive experiments are conducted on the Ego4D,
EPIC-Kitchens, and EGTEA datasets. The results consistently show that EgoPrompt
achieves state-of-the-art performance across within-dataset, cross-dataset, and
base-to-novel generalization benchmarks.

Conclusion: EmmPD框架在胎盘疾病诊断中表现出色，平衡了计算效率和特征保留，为WSI分析提供了新思路。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of placental diseases via whole slide images (WSIs) is
critical for preventing severe maternal and fetal complications. However, WSI
analysis presents significant computational challenges due to the massive data
volume. Existing WSI classification methods encounter critical limitations: (1)
inadequate patch selection strategies that either compromise performance or
fail to sufficiently reduce computational demands, and (2) the loss of global
histological context resulting from patch-level processing approaches. To
address these challenges, we propose an Efficient multimodal framework for
Patient-level placental disease Diagnosis, named EmmPD. Our approach introduces
a two-stage patch selection module that combines parameter-free and learnable
compression strategies, optimally balancing computational efficiency with
critical feature preservation. Additionally, we develop a hybrid multimodal
fusion module that leverages adaptive graph learning to enhance pathological
feature representation and incorporates textual medical reports to enrich
global contextual understanding. Extensive experiments conducted on both a
self-constructed patient-level Placental dataset and two public datasets
demonstrating that our method achieves state-of-the-art diagnostic performance.

Abstract: Deep learning-based semantic segmentation models achieve impressive results
yet remain limited in handling distribution shifts between training and test
data. In this paper, we present SDGPA (Synthetic Data Generation and
Progressive Adaptation), a novel method that tackles zero-shot domain adaptive
semantic segmentation, in which no target images are available, but only a text
description of the target domain's style is provided. To compensate for the
lack of target domain training data, we utilize a pretrained off-the-shelf
text-to-image diffusion model, which generates training images by transferring
source domain images to target style. Directly editing source domain images
introduces noise that harms segmentation because the layout of source images
cannot be precisely maintained. To address inaccurate layouts in synthetic
data, we propose a method that crops the source image, edits small patches
individually, and then merges them back together, which helps improve spatial
precision. Recognizing the large domain gap, SDGPA constructs an augmented
intermediate domain, leveraging easier adaptation subtasks to enable more
stable model adaptation to the target domain. Additionally, to mitigate the
impact of noise in synthetic data, we design a progressive adaptation strategy,
ensuring robust learning throughout the training process. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot
semantic segmentation. The code is available at

### [177] [VLMQ: Efficient Post-Training Quantization for Large Vision-Language Models via Hessian Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03351)
*Yufei Xue,Yushi Huang,Jiawei Shao,Jun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对视觉语言模型（VLM）的新型重要性感知后训练量化框架VLMQ，解决了模态差异问题，并在低比特量化下取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Hessian的LLM后训练量化方法在应用于VLM时性能下降严重，原因是未考虑视觉令牌的冗余性。

Method: VLMQ通过优化重要性感知目标，生成增强的Hessian矩阵，并利用单次轻量级块级反向传播计算令牌级重要性因子。

Result: 在8个基准测试中，VLMQ在0.5B∼32B规模的VLM上表现出色，尤其在低比特量化下，如2比特量化时MME-RealWorld任务提升了16.45%。

Conclusion: VLMQ为VLM的后训练量化提供了高效且有效的解决方案，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as an effective approach for
compressing large models and accelerating their inference without retraining.
While PTQ has been extensively studied in the context of large language models
(LLMs), its applicability to vision-language models (VLMs) remains
underexplored. In this paper, we identify a modality discrepancy (\emph{i.e.},
limited text tokens \emph{vs.} excessive and redundant vision tokens) of VLMs.
However, existing Hessian-based LLM PTQ methods treat all tokens equally during
quantization, resulting in severe performance drops when applied to VLMs.
Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel importance-aware PTQ
framework tailored for VLMs, dubbed VLMQ. Specifically, to address vision token
redundancy, VLMQ 1) optimizes an importance-aware objective that yields an
enhanced Hessian with token-level importance factors, while retaining
compatibility with parallelized weight updates, and 2) ensures efficiency and
effectiveness by computing these factors via a single lightweight block-wise
backward pass, guided by a theoretical connection to token-level perturbations.
Extensive evaluations on 8 benchmarks across 0.5B$\sim$32B VLMs demonstrate the
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of our VLMQ, particularly under low-bit
settings. For example, it achieves a substantial \textbf{16.45\%} improvement
on MME-RealWorld under 2-bit quantization.

*Libo Zhang,Xinyu Yi,Feng Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BaroPoser结合IMU和气压计数据，实时估计人体姿态和全局平移，尤其在非平坦地形上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法因传感器数据稀疏和缺乏非平坦地形数据集，在姿态估计精度和地形适应性上受限。

Method: 利用智能手机和智能手表的气压计数据估计高度变化，提出局部大腿坐标系以分离局部和全局运动输入。

Result: 在公开基准数据集和真实记录中，BaroPoser优于仅使用IMU的现有方法。

Conclusion: BaroPoser通过结合气压计数据，显著提升了非平坦地形下的人体运动估计性能。

Abstract: In recent years, tracking human motion using IMUs from everyday devices such
as smartphones and smartwatches has gained increasing popularity. However, due
to the sparsity of sensor measurements and the lack of datasets capturing human
motion over uneven terrain, existing methods often struggle with pose
estimation accuracy and are typically limited to recovering movements on flat
terrain only. To this end, we present BaroPoser, the first method that combines
IMU and barometric data recorded by a smartphone and a smartwatch to estimate
human pose and global translation in real time. By leveraging barometric
readings, we estimate sensor height changes, which provide valuable cues for
both improving the accuracy of human pose estimation and predicting global
translation on non-flat terrain. Furthermore, we propose a local thigh
coordinate frame to disentangle local and global motion input for better pose
representation learning. We evaluate our method on both public benchmark
datasets and real-world recordings. Quantitative and qualitative results
demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods
that use IMUs only with the same hardware configuration.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于架构的知识蒸馏（KD）分类法，用于解决目标检测中的计算成本问题，并评估了不同方法在MS COCO和PASCAL VOC数据集上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标检测在深度学习中的改进通常伴随计算成本增加，限制了在资源受限设备上的部署。知识蒸馏（KD）提供了一种解决方案，但目标检测中的多任务特性（分类与定位）和特征不平衡带来了挑战。

Method: 提出了一种架构中心的KD分类法，区分了CNN和Transformer检测器的不同蒸馏级别（如骨干、颈部、头部等），并评估了代表性方法。

Result: 在MS COCO和PASCAL VOC数据集上以mAP@0.5为指标进行了比较分析，展示了不同方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该分类法和分析旨在澄清KD在目标检测中的发展现状，指出当前挑战，并为未来高效可扩展的检测系统研究提供指导。

Abstract: Object detection has achieved remarkable accuracy through deep learning, yet
these improvements often come with increased computational cost, limiting
deployment on resource-constrained devices. Knowledge Distillation (KD)
provides an effective solution by enabling compact student models to learn from
larger teacher models. However, adapting KD to object detection poses unique
challenges due to its dual objectives-classification and localization-as well
as foreground-background imbalance and multi-scale feature representation. This
review introduces a novel architecture-centric taxonomy for KD methods,
distinguishing between CNN-based detectors (covering backbone-level,
neck-level, head-level, and RPN/RoI-level distillation) and Transformer-based
detectors (including query-level, feature-level, and logit-level distillation).
We further evaluate representative methods using the MS COCO and PASCAL VOC
datasets with mAP@0.5 as performance metric, providing a comparative analysis
of their effectiveness. The proposed taxonomy and analysis aim to clarify the
evolving landscape of KD in object detection, highlight current challenges, and
guide future research toward efficient and scalable detection systems.

Motivation: 现有T2I扩散模型主要依赖提示级建模，因输入标记容量有限导致个性化不准确，需改进。

Method: 提出DrUM方法，结合用户画像与基于Transformer的适配器，在潜在空间进行条件级建模。

Result: DrUM在大规模数据集上表现优异，兼容开源文本编码器，无需额外微调即可与主流T2I模型集成。

Conclusion: DrUM通过条件级建模有效提升个性化生成效果，兼容性强，适用于广泛T2I模型。

Abstract: Personalized generation in T2I diffusion models aims to naturally incorporate
individual user preferences into the generation process with minimal user
intervention. However, existing studies primarily rely on prompt-level modeling
with large-scale models, often leading to inaccurate personalization due to the
limited input token capacity of T2I diffusion models. To address these
limitations, we propose DrUM, a novel method that integrates user profiling
with a transformer-based adapter to enable personalized generation through
condition-level modeling in the latent space. DrUM demonstrates strong
performance on large-scale datasets and seamlessly integrates with open-source
text encoders, making it compatible with widely used foundation T2I models
without requiring additional fine-tuning.

Motivation: 传统雷达手势识别系统需要连续采样和处理数据，导致高功耗和计算开销。本文旨在通过事件驱动架构和生物启发方法降低这些开销。

Method: 系统包括24 GHz多普勒雷达前端和神经形态采样器，将中频信号转换为稀疏的基于脉冲的表示，并通过轻量级神经网络在Cortex-M0微控制器上实现低延迟推理。

Result: 在七名用户的五种手势数据集上，系统实现了>85%的实时准确率。

Conclusion: 这是首个将生物启发的异步Sigma-Delta编码和事件驱动处理框架用于雷达手势识别的研究，显著降低了功耗和计算开销。

Abstract: We present a neuromorphic radar framework for real-time, low-power hand
gesture recognition (HGR) using an event-driven architecture inspired by
biological sensing. Our system comprises a 24 GHz Doppler radar front-end and a
custom neuromorphic sampler that converts intermediate-frequency (IF) signals
into sparse spike-based representations via asynchronous sigma-delta encoding.
These events are directly processed by a lightweight neural network deployed on
a Cortex-M0 microcontroller, enabling low-latency inference without requiring
spectrogram reconstruction. Unlike conventional radar HGR pipelines that
continuously sample and process data, our architecture activates only when
meaningful motion is detected, significantly reducing memory, power, and
computation overhead. Evaluated on a dataset of five gestures collected from
seven users, our system achieves > 85% real-time accuracy. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work that employs bio-inspired asynchronous
sigma-delta encoding and an event-driven processing framework for radar-based
HGR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归扩散模型在短时视频生成中表现优异，但在长视频生成中因时间漂移和并行化限制而效果不佳。

Method: 采用两阶段分层规划（Micro Planning和Macro Planning）生成全局故事线，并通过并行填充中间帧优化生成效率。

Result: 实验证明该方法在质量和稳定性上优于现有长视频生成模型。

Conclusion: MMPL框架有效解决了长视频生成中的时间漂移和并行化问题，提升了生成效果。

Abstract: Current autoregressive diffusion models excel at video generation but are
generally limited to short temporal durations. Our theoretical analysis
indicates that the autoregressive modeling typically suffers from temporal
drift caused by error accumulation and hinders parallelization in long video
synthesis. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
planning-then-populating framework centered on Macro-from-Micro Planning (MMPL)
for long video generation. MMPL sketches a global storyline for the entire
video through two hierarchical stages: Micro Planning and Macro Planning.
Specifically, Micro Planning predicts a sparse set of future keyframes within
each short video segment, offering motion and appearance priors to guide
high-quality video segment generation. Macro Planning extends the in-segment
keyframes planning across the entire video through an autoregressive chain of
micro plans, ensuring long-term consistency across video segments.
Subsequently, MMPL-based Content Populating generates all intermediate frames
in parallel across segments, enabling efficient parallelization of
autoregressive generation. The parallelization is further optimized by Adaptive
Workload Scheduling for balanced GPU execution and accelerated autoregressive
video generation. Extensive experiments confirm that our method outperforms
existing long video generation models in quality and stability. Generated
videos and comparison results are in our project page.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有增强方法在恢复暗图像细节和边缘时效果有限，影响了文本和边缘检测等应用。

Method: 第一阶段使用RFGM在频域恢复全局光照；第二阶段通过Patch Mamba和Grad Mamba模块细化纹理结构。

Result: 在多个基准数据集和下游任务中显著提升细节恢复性能，同时保持高效。

Conclusion: 该方法轻量且可无缝集成到现有傅里叶框架中，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Recovering fine-grained details in extremely dark images remains challenging
due to severe structural information loss and noise corruption. Existing
enhancement methods often fail to preserve intricate details and sharp edges,
limiting their effectiveness in downstream applications like text and edge
detection. To address these deficiencies, we propose an efficient dual-stage
approach centered on detail recovery for dark images. In the first stage, we
introduce a Residual Fourier-Guided Module (RFGM) that effectively restores
global illumination in the frequency domain. RFGM captures inter-stage and
inter-channel dependencies through residual connections, providing robust
priors for high-fidelity frequency processing while mitigating error
accumulation risks from unreliable priors. The second stage employs
complementary Mamba modules specifically designed for textural structure
refinement: (1) Patch Mamba operates on channel-concatenated non-downsampled
patches, meticulously modeling pixel-level correlations to enhance fine-grained
details without resolution loss. (2) Grad Mamba explicitly focuses on
high-gradient regions, alleviating state decay in state space models and
prioritizing reconstruction of sharp edges and boundaries. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmark datasets and downstream applications
demonstrate that our method significantly improves detail recovery performance
while maintaining efficiency. Crucially, the proposed modules are lightweight
and can be seamlessly integrated into existing Fourier-based frameworks with
minimal computational overhead. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有的模因匹配方法大多局限于基于模板的模因，忽视了非模板模因的匹配需求，限制了模因分析的全面性和自动化效果。

Method: 论文引入了基于视觉元素的广义模因匹配方法，比较了传统相似性度量（包括分段计算）和基于多模态大语言模型的提示方法。

Result: 传统方法在模板模因上表现良好，但在非模板模因上效果有限；分段相似性度量在非模板模因上优于整体图像度量。

Conclusion: 模因匹配需要更复杂的技术，尤其是针对非模板模因，多模态大语言模型显示出潜力但仍需改进。

Abstract: Internet memes, now a staple of digital communication, play a pivotal role in
how users engage within online communities and allow researchers to gain
insight into contemporary digital culture. These engaging user-generated
content are characterised by their reuse of visual elements also found in other
memes. Matching instances of memes via these shared visual elements, called
Meme Matching, is the basis of a wealth of meme analysis approaches. However,
most existing methods assume that every meme consists of a shared visual
background, called a Template, with some overlaid text, thereby limiting meme
matching to comparing the background image alone. Current approaches exclude
the many memes that are not template-based and limit the effectiveness of
automated meme analysis and would not be effective at linking memes to
contemporary web-based meme dictionaries. In this work, we introduce a broader
formulation of meme matching that extends beyond template matching. We show
that conventional similarity measures, including a novel segment-wise
computation of the similarity measures, excel at matching template-based memes
but fall short when applied to non-template-based meme formats. However, the
segment-wise approach was found to consistently outperform the whole-image
measures on matching non-template-based memes. Finally, we explore a
prompting-based approach using a pretrained Multimodal Large Language Model for
meme matching. Our results highlight that accurately matching memes via shared
visual elements, not just background templates, remains an open challenge that
requires more sophisticated matching techniques.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自适应帧剪枝（AFP）方法，通过减少视频问答任务中的冗余帧，显著降低了计算成本并提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在视频问答（Video-QA）中因处理大量视频帧的高计算成本而受限，且现有关键帧选择方法存在冗余问题。

Method: 提出AFP方法，使用自适应层次聚类算法在融合的特征空间中识别并合并冗余帧，同时引入轻量级文本语义图补充信息。

Result: 实验表明，AFP方法在LongVideoBench和VideoMME基准上减少了86.9%的帧和83.2%的输入token，且性能优于基线。

Conclusion: AFP方法通过高效剪枝和补充语义信息，显著提升了视频问答任务的效率和准确性。

Abstract: The practical application of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to
Video Question Answering (Video-QA) is severely hindered by the high token cost
of processing numerous video frames. While increasing the number of sampled
frames is a common strategy, we observe a "less is more" phenomenon where
excessive frames can paradoxically degrade performance due to context dilution.
Concurrently, state-of-the-art keyframe selection methods, while effective,
still yield significant temporal redundancy, which we term 'visual echoes'. To
address these dual challenges, we propose Adaptive Frame-Pruning (AFP), a novel
post-processing method that intelligently prunes the selected keyframes. AFP
employs an adaptive hierarchical clustering algorithm on a fused ResNet-50 and
CLIP feature space to identify and merge these echoes into single
representatives. To compensate for information loss, we then introduce a
lightweight, text-based semantic graph that provides critical context with
minimal token overhead. Conducting extensive experiments on the LongVideoBench
and VideoMME benchmarks across multiple leading MLLMs, our full approach
demonstrates a drastic reduction in required frames by up to 86.9% and total
input tokens by up to 83.2%. Crucially, by providing a concise, high-quality
set of frames, our method not only enhances efficiency but often improves
accuracy over baselines that use more frames. The code will be released upon
publication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 夜间图像可见性差，现有方法缺乏解释性或依赖不可靠先验，物理方法假设简化，难以应对复杂场景。

Method: 使用向量量化映射图像特征到离散码本，通过像素级和特征级因果干预校正分布偏移，高频细节重建模块恢复细节。

Result: CIVQLLIE框架有效提升低光图像质量，增强细节和亮度分布。

Conclusion: CIVQLLIE通过离散表示学习和因果干预，显著改进低光图像增强效果。

Abstract: Images captured in nighttime scenes suffer from severely reduced visibility,
hindering effective content perception. Current low-light image enhancement
(LLIE) methods face significant challenges: data-driven end-to-end mapping
networks lack interpretability or rely on unreliable prior guidance, struggling
under extremely dark conditions, while physics-based methods depend on
simplified assumptions that often fail in complex real-world scenarios. To
address these limitations, we propose CIVQLLIE, a novel framework that
leverages the power of discrete representation learning through causal
reasoning. We achieve this through Vector Quantization (VQ), which maps
continuous image features to a discrete codebook of visual tokens learned from
large-scale high-quality images. This codebook serves as a reliable prior,
encoding standardized brightness and color patterns that are independent of
degradation. However, direct application of VQ to low-light images fails due to
distribution shifts between degraded inputs and the learned codebook.
Therefore, we propose a multi-level causal intervention approach to
systematically correct these shifts. First, during encoding, our Pixel-level
Causal Intervention (PCI) module intervenes to align low-level features with
the brightness and color distributions expected by the codebook. Second, a
Feature-aware Causal Intervention (FCI) mechanism with Low-frequency Selective
Attention Gating (LSAG) identifies and enhances channels most affected by
illumination degradation, facilitating accurate codebook token matching while
enhancing the encoder's generalization performance through flexible
feature-level intervention. Finally, during decoding, the High-frequency Detail
Reconstruction Module (HDRM) leverages structural information preserved in the
matched codebook representations to reconstruct fine details using deformable
convolution techniques.

Motivation: 现有方法忽视人体结构的复杂性和时空动态性，导致语义对齐不精确。

Method: WaMo包含三个关键组件：轨迹小波分解、轨迹小波重构和无序运动序列预测。

Result: 在HumanML3D和KIT-ML数据集上，Rsum分别提升17.0%和18.2%，优于现有SOTA方法。

Conclusion: WaMo通过多频率特征提取和时空信息保留，显著提升了文本-运动检索的性能。

Abstract: Text-Motion Retrieval (TMR) aims to retrieve 3D motion sequences semantically
relevant to text descriptions. However, matching 3D motions with text remains
highly challenging, primarily due to the intricate structure of human body and
its spatial-temporal dynamics. Existing approaches often overlook these
complexities, relying on general encoding methods that fail to distinguish
different body parts and their dynamics, limiting precise semantic alignment.
To address this, we propose WaMo, a novel wavelet-based multi-frequency feature
extraction framework. It fully captures part-specific and time-varying motion
details across multiple resolutions on body joints, extracting discriminative
motion features to achieve fine-grained alignment with texts. WaMo has three
key components: (1) Trajectory Wavelet Decomposition decomposes motion signals
into frequency components that preserve both local kinematic details and global
motion semantics. (2) Trajectory Wavelet Reconstruction uses learnable inverse
wavelet transforms to reconstruct original joint trajectories from extracted
features, ensuring the preservation of essential spatial-temporal information.
(3) Disordered Motion Sequence Prediction reorders shuffled motion sequences to
improve the learning of inherent temporal coherence, enhancing motion-text
alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate WaMo's superiority, achieving
17.0\% and 18.2\% improvements in $Rsum$ on HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets,
respectively, outperforming existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

Result: 在五个图像分类基准测试中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FedPromo在性能、隐私和资源效率之间取得平衡。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is an established paradigm for training deep learning
models on decentralized data. However, as the size of the models grows,
conventional FL approaches often require significant computational resources on
client devices, which may not be feasible. We introduce FedPromo, a novel
framework that enables efficient adaptation of large-scale foundation models
stored on a central server to new domains encountered only by remote clients.
Instead of directly training the large model on client devices, FedPromo
optimizes lightweight proxy models via FL, significantly reducing computational
overhead while maintaining privacy. Our method follows a two-stage process:
first, server-side knowledge distillation aligns the representations of a
large-scale foundation model (e.g., a transformer) with those of a compact
counterpart (e.g., a CNN). Then, the compact model encoder is deployed to
client devices, where trainable classifiers are learned locally. These
classifiers are subsequently aggregated and seamlessly transferred back to the
foundation model, facilitating personalized adaptation without requiring direct
access to user data. Through novel regularization strategies, our framework
enables decentralized multi-domain learning, balancing performance, privacy,
and resource efficiency. Extensive experiments on five image classification
benchmarks demonstrate that FedPromo outperforms existing methods while
assuming limited-resource clients.

Result: 实验证明DOD在视觉质量和推理效率上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DOD是一种高效且适应性强的图像修复方法。

Abstract: Diffusion models have revealed powerful potential in all-in-one image
restoration (AiOIR), which is talented in generating abundant texture details.
The existing AiOIR methods either retrain a diffusion model or fine-tune the
pretrained diffusion model with extra conditional guidance. However, they often
suffer from high inference costs and limited adaptability to diverse
degradation types. In this paper, we propose an efficient AiOIR method,
Diffusion Once and Done (DOD), which aims to achieve superior restoration
performance with only one-step sampling of Stable Diffusion (SD) models.
Specifically, multi-degradation feature modulation is first introduced to
capture different degradation prompts with a pretrained diffusion model. Then,
parameter-efficient conditional low-rank adaptation integrates the prompts to
enable the fine-tuning of the SD model for adapting to different degradation
types. Besides, a high-fidelity detail enhancement module is integrated into
the decoder of SD to improve structural and textural details. Experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing diffusion-based restoration
approaches in both visual quality and inference efficiency.

Result: 在多个评估指标和架构中表现优异，解剖学注入策略有效。

Conclusion: GRASP成功将解剖学背景融入病理分割，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Radiologists rely on anatomical understanding to accurately delineate
pathologies, yet most current deep learning approaches use pure pattern
recognition and ignore the anatomical context in which pathologies develop. To
narrow this gap, we introduce GRASP (Guided Representation Alignment for the
Segmentation of Pathologies), a modular plug-and-play framework that enhances
pathology segmentation models by leveraging existing anatomy segmentation
models through pseudolabel integration and feature alignment. Unlike previous
approaches that obtain anatomical knowledge via auxiliary training, GRASP
integrates into standard pathology optimization regimes without retraining
anatomical components. We evaluate GRASP on two PET/CT datasets, conduct
systematic ablation studies, and investigate the framework's inner workings. We
find that GRASP consistently achieves top rankings across multiple evaluation
metrics and diverse architectures. The framework's dual anatomy injection
strategy, combining anatomical pseudo-labels as input channels with
transformer-guided anatomical feature fusion, effectively incorporates
anatomical context.

TL;DR: 提出了一种持续步态识别方法GaitAdapt和GaitAdapter，通过GPAK模块和EDSM方法解决模型在新数据集上性能下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有步态识别方法在新数据集上需要重新训练，且难以保留之前数据集的知识，导致性能下降。

Method: 提出GaitAdapter方法，结合GPAK模块和EDSM方法，通过图神经网络和负样本对优化特征区分性。

Result: GaitAdapter能有效保留多任务知识，显著优于其他方法。

Conclusion: GaitAdapter解决了持续学习中的知识保留问题，提升了步态识别的性能。

Abstract: Current gait recognition methodologies generally necessitate retraining when
encountering new datasets. Nevertheless, retrained models frequently encounter
difficulties in preserving knowledge from previous datasets, leading to a
significant decline in performance on earlier test sets. To tackle these
challenges, we present a continual gait recognition task, termed GaitAdapt,
which supports the progressive enhancement of gait recognition capabilities
over time and is systematically categorized according to various evaluation
scenarios. Additionally, we propose GaitAdapter, a non-replay continual
learning approach for gait recognition. This approach integrates the
GaitPartition Adaptive Knowledge (GPAK) module, employing graph neural networks
to aggregate common gait patterns from current data into a repository
constructed from graph vectors. Subsequently, this repository is used to
improve the discriminability of gait features in new tasks, thereby enhancing
the model's ability to effectively recognize gait patterns. We also introduce a
Euclidean Distance Stability Method (EDSN) based on negative pairs, which
ensures that newly added gait samples from different classes maintain similar
relative spatial distributions across both previous and current gait tasks,
thereby alleviating the impact of task changes on the distinguishability of
original domain features. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that GaitAdapter
effectively retains gait knowledge acquired from diverse tasks, exhibiting
markedly superior discriminative capability compared to alternative methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出NAVIA方法，通过信息增强中和令牌聚合，解决高效测试时适应（ETTA）问题，显著提升性能并降低推理延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时适应（TTA）方法计算开销大，令牌聚合虽高效但导致性能下降，需平衡适应能力和推理效率。

Method: 提出NAVIA方法，通过增强[CLS]令牌嵌入和自适应偏置，恢复令牌聚合导致的信息损失，优化熵最小化。

Result: NAVIA在多个分布外基准测试中性能提升2.5%以上，推理延迟降低20%以上。

Conclusion: NAVIA有效解决了ETTA问题，平衡了适应能力和效率。

Abstract: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) has emerged as an effective solution for adapting
Vision Transformers (ViT) to distribution shifts without additional training
data. However, existing TTA methods often incur substantial computational
overhead, limiting their applicability in resource-constrained real-world
scenarios. To reduce inference cost, plug-and-play token aggregation methods
merge redundant tokens in ViTs to reduce total processed tokens. Albeit
efficient, it suffers from significant performance degradation when directly
integrated with existing TTA methods. We formalize this problem as Efficient
Test-Time Adaptation (ETTA), seeking to preserve the adaptation capability of
TTA while reducing inference latency. In this paper, we first provide a
theoretical analysis from a novel mutual information perspective, showing that
token aggregation inherently leads to information loss, which cannot be fully
mitigated by conventional norm-tuning-based TTA methods. Guided by this
insight, we propose to \textbf{N}eutralize Token \textbf{A}ggregation
\textbf{v}ia \textbf{I}nformation \textbf{A}ugmentation (\textbf{NAVIA}).
Specifically, we directly augment the [CLS] token embedding and incorporate
adaptive biases into the [CLS] token in shallow layers of ViTs. We
theoretically demonstrate that these augmentations, when optimized via entropy
minimization, recover the information lost due to token aggregation. Extensive
experiments across various out-of-distribution benchmarks demonstrate that
NAVIA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by over 2.5\%, while
achieving an inference latency reduction of more than 20\%, effectively
addressing the ETTA challenge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在显式解耦风格与内容时面临语义重叠和主观性的挑战，SCFlow尝试通过可逆合并绕过这一难题。

Method: SCFlow采用流匹配框架，学习风格与内容之间的双向映射，无需显式监督，利用合成数据集训练。

Result: SCFlow在ImageNet-1k和WikiArt上表现出色，证明解耦可通过可逆合并自然实现。

Conclusion: SCFlow展示了通过可逆合并实现风格与内容解耦的潜力，为生成任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Explicitly disentangling style and content in vision models remains
challenging due to their semantic overlap and the subjectivity of human
perception. Existing methods propose separation through generative or
discriminative objectives, but they still face the inherent ambiguity of
disentangling intertwined concepts. Instead, we ask: Can we bypass explicit
disentanglement by learning to merge style and content invertibly, allowing
separation to emerge naturally? We propose SCFlow, a flow-matching framework
that learns bidirectional mappings between entangled and disentangled
representations. Our approach is built upon three key insights: 1) Training
solely to merge style and content, a well-defined task, enables invertible
disentanglement without explicit supervision; 2) flow matching bridges on
arbitrary distributions, avoiding the restrictive Gaussian priors of diffusion
models and normalizing flows; and 3) a synthetic dataset of 510,000 samples (51
styles $\times$ 10,000 content samples) was curated to simulate disentanglement
through systematic style-content pairing. Beyond controllable generation tasks,
we demonstrate that SCFlow generalizes to ImageNet-1k and WikiArt in zero-shot
settings and achieves competitive performance, highlighting that
disentanglement naturally emerges from the invertible merging process.

Motivation: 高光谱解混是预处理关键步骤，现有方法在精度和空间相似性考虑上不足。

Result: 实验表明STVMLU优于其他算法。

Conclusion: STVMLU有效提高了高光谱解混的精度和性能。

Abstract: Hyperspectral unmixing aims at estimating material signatures (known as
endmembers) and the corresponding proportions (referred to abundances), which
is a critical preprocessing step in various hyperspectral imagery applications.
This study develops a novel approach called sparsity and total variation (TV)
constrained multilayer linear unmixing (STVMLU) for hyperspectral imagery.
Specifically, based on a multilayer matrix factorization model, to improve the
accuracy of unmixing, a TV constraint is incorporated to consider adjacent
spatial similarity. Additionally, a L1/2-norm sparse constraint is adopted to
effectively characterize the sparsity of the abundance matrix. For optimizing
the STVMLU model, the method of alternating direction method of multipliers
(ADMM) is employed, which allows for the simultaneous extraction of endmembers
and their corresponding abundance matrix. Experimental results illustrate the
enhanced performance of the proposed STVMLU when compared to other algorithms.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在参数规模、自我纠正能力和处理长视觉上下文及复杂推理任务方面表现不佳，MACT旨在解决这些问题。

Method: MACT包含规划、执行、判断和回答四个智能体，采用混合奖励建模和智能体级混合测试时扩展策略。

Result: 在15个基准测试中，MACT的三种变体平均得分位列前三，并在13个测试中领先，性能优于传统模型。

Conclusion: MACT通过多智能体协作和定制化扩展策略，显著提升了视觉文档理解和复杂推理任务的性能，且参数规模更小。

Abstract: Existing vision-language models (VLMs), whether generalists or specialists,
remain constrained by their parameter scale, lack robust self-correction
capabilities, and underperform in tasks involving long visual contexts and
complex reasoning, resulting in suboptimal performance on document-based tasks.
To address this, we propose MACT, a Multi-Agent Collaboration framework with
Test-Time scaling, tailored for visual document understanding and visual
question answering (VQA). It comprises four distinct small-scale agents, i.e.,
planning, execution, judgment, and answer agents, with clearly defined roles
and effective collaboration. Notably, the judgment agent exclusively verifies
correctness and redirects to prior agents for revisions, outperforming
conventional correction strategies. To further expand the capability boundaries
of the framework, we propose mixed reward modeling that balances agent-specific
abilities and global collaboration, as well as agent-wise hybrid test-time
scaling, which customizes different scaling strategies for each agent based on
their functions. Evaluated on benchmarks spanning both document-based and
non-document-based settings, our MACT shows superior performance with a smaller
parameter scale without sacrificing the ability of general and mathematical
tasks. Especially, it stands out in benchmarks involving long visual contexts
and complicated reasoning. The three variants of MACT consistently hold the top
three positions in average scores, leading in 13 of the 15 benchmarks. Code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无监督视频分割任务中缺乏监督信号和复杂视觉场景的挑战，同时避免使用计算昂贵的大型模型。

Method: 提出SlotMatch框架，通过余弦相似度对齐师生模型的slot表示，无需额外损失或辅助监督。

Result: 学生模型在参数减少3.6倍、速度提升1.9倍的情况下，性能达到甚至超过教师模型，并超越其他无监督视频分割模型。

Conclusion: SlotMatch展示了简单高效的知识蒸馏方法在无监督视频分割中的潜力。

Abstract: Unsupervised video segmentation is a challenging computer vision task,
especially due to the lack of supervisory signals coupled with the complexity
of visual scenes. To overcome this challenge, state-of-the-art models based on
slot attention often have to rely on large and computationally expensive neural
architectures. To this end, we propose a simple knowledge distillation
framework that effectively transfers object-centric representations to a
lightweight student. The proposed framework, called SlotMatch, aligns
corresponding teacher and student slots via the cosine similarity, requiring no
additional distillation objectives or auxiliary supervision. The simplicity of
SlotMatch is confirmed via theoretical and empirical evidence, both indicating
that integrating additional losses is redundant. We conduct experiments on two
datasets to compare the state-of-the-art teacher model, SlotContrast, with our
distilled student. The results show that our student based on SlotMatch matches
and even outperforms its teacher, while using 3.6x less parameters and running
1.9x faster. Moreover, our student surpasses previous unsupervised video
segmentation models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升图像翻译任务中潜在表示学习的质量，以更准确地逼近真实数据分布，同时保留源域的结构一致性。

Method: 采用局部邻域编码（LNE）和频率感知监督，结合KL/JS散度和基于对数相似度的损失度量，量化生成图像与真实图像在空间和频率域的对齐。

Result: 在Horse2Zebra、Monet2Photo和Strike-off数据集上，Fd-CycleGAN表现出更优的感知质量、更快收敛和更好的模式多样性，尤其在低数据量场景中。

Conclusion: Fd-CycleGAN通过频率引导的潜在学习显著提升了图像翻译任务的泛化能力，适用于文档修复、艺术风格迁移和医学图像合成等领域。

Abstract: This paper presents Fd-CycleGAN, an image-to-image (I2I) translation
framework that enhances latent representation learning to approximate real data
distributions. Building upon the foundation of CycleGAN, our approach
integrates Local Neighborhood Encoding (LNE) and frequency-aware supervision to
capture fine-grained local pixel semantics while preserving structural
coherence from the source domain. We employ distribution-based loss metrics,
including KL/JS divergence and log-based similarity measures, to explicitly
quantify the alignment between real and generated image distributions in both
spatial and frequency domains. To validate the efficacy of Fd-CycleGAN, we
conduct experiments on diverse datasets -- Horse2Zebra, Monet2Photo, and a
synthetically augmented Strike-off dataset. Compared to baseline CycleGAN and
other state-of-the-art methods, our approach demonstrates superior perceptual
quality, faster convergence, and improved mode diversity, particularly in
low-data regimes. By effectively capturing local and global distribution
characteristics, Fd-CycleGAN achieves more visually coherent and semantically
consistent translations. Our results suggest that frequency-guided latent
learning significantly improves generalization in image translation tasks, with
promising applications in document restoration, artistic style transfer, and
medical image synthesis. We also provide comparative insights with
diffusion-based generative models, highlighting the advantages of our
lightweight adversarial approach in terms of training efficiency and
qualitative output.

Abstract: X-ray medical report generation is one of the important applications of
artificial intelligence in healthcare. With the support of large foundation
models, the quality of medical report generation has significantly improved.
However, challenges such as hallucination and weak disease diagnostic
capability still persist. In this paper, we first construct a large-scale
multi-modal medical knowledge graph (termed M3KG) based on the ground truth
medical report using the GPT-4o. It contains 2477 entities, 3 kinds of
relations, 37424 triples, and 6943 disease-aware vision tokens for the CheXpert
Plus dataset. Then, we sample it to obtain multi-granularity semantic graphs
and use an R-GCN encoder for feature extraction. For the input X-ray image, we
adopt the Swin-Transformer to extract the vision features and interact with the
knowledge using cross-attention. The vision tokens are fed into a Q-former and
retrieved the disease-aware vision tokens using another cross-attention.
Finally, we adopt the large language model to map the semantic knowledge graph,
input X-ray image, and disease-aware vision tokens into language descriptions.
Extensive experiments on multiple datasets fully validated the effectiveness of
our proposed knowledge graph and X-ray report generation framework. The source
code of this paper will be released on

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG信号分类面临数据分布偏移的挑战，主要源于电极配置、采集协议和硬件差异。IMAC旨在通过空间时间序列插补任务对齐跨域数据。

Method: IMAC采用3D到2D位置统一映射标准化电极布局，提出通道依赖掩码和重建任务，模拟跨域变化，并分离时空信息建模。

Result: 在10个公开EEG数据集上，IMAC实现了最先进的分类准确性，在模拟和真实分布偏移下均表现出强鲁棒性，性能提升高达35%。

Conclusion: IMAC通过创新的自监督框架和时空对齐策略，有效解决了跨域EEG信号分类问题，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal classification faces significant challenges
due to data distribution shifts caused by heterogeneous electrode
configurations, acquisition protocols, and hardware discrepancies across
domains. This paper introduces IMAC, a novel channel-dependent mask and
imputation self-supervised framework that formulates the alignment of
cross-domain EEG data shifts as a spatial time series imputation task. To
address heterogeneous electrode configurations in cross-domain scenarios, IMAC
first standardizes different electrode layouts using a 3D-to-2D positional
unification mapping strategy, establishing unified spatial representations.
Unlike previous mask-based self-supervised representation learning methods,
IMAC introduces spatio-temporal signal alignment. This involves constructing a
channel-dependent mask and reconstruction task framed as a low-to-high
resolution EEG spatial imputation problem. Consequently, this approach
simulates cross-domain variations such as channel omissions and temporal
instabilities, thus enabling the model to leverage the proposed imputer for
robust signal alignment during inference. Furthermore, IMAC incorporates a
disentangled structure that separately models the temporal and spatial
information of the EEG signals separately, reducing computational complexity
while enhancing flexibility and adaptability. Comprehensive evaluations across
10 publicly available EEG datasets demonstrate IMAC's superior performance,
achieving state-of-the-art classification accuracy in both cross-subject and
cross-center validation scenarios. Notably, IMAC shows strong robustness under
both simulated and real-world distribution shifts, surpassing baseline methods
by up to $35$\% in integrity scores while maintaining consistent classification
accuracy.

Method: 提出MedCAL-Bench基准，评估14种FMs和7种CSAL策略在7个医学数据集上的表现，涵盖分类和分割任务。

Result: 1) DINO家族在分割任务中表现最佳；2) FMs在分割任务中性能差异大，分类任务中差异小；3) ALPS和RepDiv分别在分割和分类任务中表现最优。

Conclusion: MedCAL-Bench为医学图像分析中的冷启动主动学习提供了系统评估，展示了FMs的潜力，并强调了不同任务中策略选择的重要性。

Abstract: Cold-Start Active Learning (CSAL) aims to select informative samples for
annotation without prior knowledge, which is important for improving annotation
efficiency and model performance under a limited annotation budget in medical
image analysis. Most existing CSAL methods rely on Self-Supervised Learning
(SSL) on the target dataset for feature extraction, which is inefficient and
limited by insufficient feature representation. Recently, pre-trained
Foundation Models (FMs) have shown powerful feature extraction ability with a
potential for better CSAL. However, this paradigm has been rarely investigated,
with a lack of benchmarks for comparison of FMs in CSAL tasks. To this end, we
propose MedCAL-Bench, the first systematic FM-based CSAL benchmark for medical
image analysis. We evaluate 14 FMs and 7 CSAL strategies across 7 datasets
under different annotation budgets, covering classification and segmentation
tasks from diverse medical modalities. It is also the first CSAL benchmark that
evaluates both the feature extraction and sample selection stages. Our
experimental results reveal that: 1) Most FMs are effective feature extractors
for CSAL, with DINO family performing the best in segmentation; 2) The
performance differences of these FMs are large in segmentation tasks, while
small for classification; 3) Different sample selection strategies should be
considered in CSAL on different datasets, with Active Learning by Processing
Surprisal (ALPS) performing the best in segmentation while RepDiv leading for
classification. The code is available at

Method: 通过理论分析和实证验证，发现RATIO峰值问题，并提出一种基于指数衰减的自适应引导调度方法。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在图像和视频模型中实现了3倍加速，同时保持或提升了生成质量、鲁棒性和语义对齐。

Conclusion: 自适应引导调度是释放快速流式生成模型潜力的关键。

Abstract: Flow-based generative models have recently achieved remarkable progress in
image and video synthesis, with classifier-free guidance (CFG) becoming the
standard tool for high-fidelity, controllable generation. However, despite
their practical success, little is known about how guidance interacts with
different stages of the sampling process-especially in the fast, low-step
regimes typical of modern flow-based pipelines. In this work, we uncover and
analyze a fundamental instability: the earliest reverse steps are acutely
sensitive to the guidance scale, owing to a pronounced spike in the relative
strength (RATIO) of conditional to unconditional predictions. Through rigorous
theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we show that this RATIO spike is
intrinsic to the data distribution, independent of the model architecture, and
causes exponential error amplification when paired with strong guidance. To
address this, we propose a simple, theoretically grounded, RATIO-aware adaptive
guidance schedule that automatically dampens the guidance scale at early steps
based on the evolving RATIO, using a closed-form exponential decay. Our method
is lightweight, requires no additional inference overhead, and is compatible
with standard flow frameworks. Experiments across state-of-the-art image
(SD3.5, Lumina) and video (WAN2.1) models demonstrate that our approach enables
up to 3x faster sampling while maintaining or improving generation quality,
robustness, and semantic alignment. Extensive ablation studies further confirm
the generality and stability of our schedule across models, datasets, and
hyperparameters. Our findings highlight the critical role of stepwise guidance
adaptation in unlocking the full potential of fast flow-based generative
models.

Result: 在13个工业和医学数据集上，CoPS在分类和分割任务中AUROC提升了2.5%。

Conclusion: CoPS通过动态提示和语义特征融合，显著提升了零样本异常检测的泛化能力和性能。

Abstract: Recently, large pre-trained vision-language models have shown remarkable
performance in zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD). With fine-tuning on a single
auxiliary dataset, the model enables cross-category anomaly detection on
diverse datasets covering industrial defects and medical lesions. Compared to
manually designed prompts, prompt learning eliminates the need for expert
knowledge and trial-and-error. However, it still faces the following
challenges: (i) static learnable tokens struggle to capture the continuous and
diverse patterns of normal and anomalous states, limiting generalization to
unseen categories; (ii) fixed textual labels provide overly sparse category
information, making the model prone to overfitting to a specific semantic
subspace. To address these issues, we propose Conditional Prompt Synthesis
(CoPS), a novel framework that synthesizes dynamic prompts conditioned on
visual features to enhance ZSAD performance. Specifically, we extract
representative normal and anomaly prototypes from fine-grained patch features
and explicitly inject them into prompts, enabling adaptive state modeling.
Given the sparsity of class labels, we leverage a variational autoencoder to
model semantic image features and implicitly fuse varied class tokens into
prompts. Additionally, integrated with our spatially-aware alignment mechanism,
extensive experiments demonstrate that CoPS surpasses state-of-the-art methods
by 2.5% AUROC in both classification and segmentation across 13 industrial and
medical datasets. Code will be available at https://github.com/cqylunlun/CoPS.

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著优于现有图像和视频去摩尔纹方法。

Conclusion: 双摄像头框架有效解决了摩尔纹去除中的关键挑战，提升了去摩尔纹效果。

Abstract: Moire patterns, unwanted color artifacts in images and videos, arise from the
interference between spatially high-frequency scene contents and the spatial
discrete sampling of digital cameras. Existing demoireing methods primarily
rely on single-camera image/video processing, which faces two critical
challenges: 1) distinguishing moire patterns from visually similar real
textures, and 2) preserving tonal consistency and temporal coherence while
removing moire artifacts. To address these issues, we propose a dual-camera
framework that captures synchronized videos of the same scene: one in focus
(retaining high-quality textures but may exhibit moire patterns) and one
defocused (with significantly reduced moire patterns but blurred textures). We
use the defocused video to help distinguish moire patterns from real texture,
so as to guide the demoireing of the focused video. We propose a frame-wise
demoireing pipeline, which begins with an optical flow based alignment step to
address any discrepancies in displacement and occlusion between the focused and
defocused frames. Then, we leverage the aligned defocused frame to guide the
demoireing of the focused frame using a multi-scale CNN and a multi-dimensional
training loss. To maintain tonal and temporal consistency, our final step
involves a joint bilateral filter to leverage the demoireing result from the
CNN as the guide to filter the input focused frame to obtain the final output.
Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework largely
outperforms state-of-the-art image and video demoireing methods.

Motivation: 结肠镜视频的动态性和快速相机运动带来背景噪声和假阳性风险，需要一种更有效的检测方法。

Method: AVPDN结合AFIA模块（三支架构增强特征表示）和SACI模块（多尺度上下文整合），利用自注意力和扩张卷积。

Result: 在多个公共基准测试中表现优异，展示了方法的有效性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: AVPDN在视频息肉检测任务中具有竞争力，解决了动态视频中的噪声和尺度问题。

Abstract: Accurate detection of polyps is of critical importance for the early and
intermediate stages of colorectal cancer diagnosis. Compared to static images,
dynamic colonoscopy videos provide more comprehensive visual information, which
can facilitate the development of effective treatment plans. However, unlike
fixed-camera recordings, colonoscopy videos often exhibit rapid camera
movement, introducing substantial background noise that disrupts the structural
integrity of the scene and increases the risk of false positives. To address
these challenges, we propose the Adaptive Video Polyp Detection Network
(AVPDN), a robust framework for multi-scale polyp detection in colonoscopy
videos. AVPDN incorporates two key components: the Adaptive Feature Interaction
and Augmentation (AFIA) module and the Scale-Aware Context Integration (SACI)
module. The AFIA module adopts a triple-branch architecture to enhance feature
representation. It employs dense self-attention for global context modeling,
sparse self-attention to mitigate the influence of low query-key similarity in
feature aggregation, and channel shuffle operations to facilitate inter-branch
information exchange. In parallel, the SACI module is designed to strengthen
multi-scale feature integration. It utilizes dilated convolutions with varying
receptive fields to capture contextual information at multiple spatial scales,
thereby improving the model's denoising capability. Experiments conducted on
several challenging public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalization ability of the proposed method, achieving competitive
performance in video-based polyp detection tasks.

<details>

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在视觉和语言协同推理中存在幻觉问题，且随着序列增长幻觉加剧，但其原因尚不明确。

Method: 分析了视觉注意力与长序列幻觉的关系，提出IKOD方法，通过合并高图像注意力的短序列logits来抑制幻觉。

Result: 实验表明IKOD能显著减少幻觉并提升模型综合能力，且计算成本低。

Conclusion: IKOD是一种轻量高效的解码策略，适用于多种模型，无需额外资源。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated
significant progress across multiple domains. However, these models still face
the inherent challenge of integrating vision and language for collaborative
inference, which often leads to "hallucinations", outputs that are not grounded
in the corresponding images. Many efforts have been made to address these
issues, but each comes with its own limitations, such as high computational
cost or expensive dataset annotation. Recent research shows that LVLMs exhibit
a long-term bias where hallucinations increase as the sequence length grows,
yet the underlying cause remains poorly understood. Building on extensive
research into attention mechanisms in LVLMs, we analyze the relationship
between this long-term bias and visual attention. In our research, we identify
a consistent phenomenon in current LVLMs: the model's attention to visual input
diminishes as the generated sequence grows, which we hypothesize to be a key
factor contributing to observed increasing hallucinations. Based on these
insights, we propose Image attention-guided Key-value merging cOllaborative
Decoding (IKOD), a collaborative decoding strategy generating more
image-focused sequences. This method derives logits from shorter sequences with
higher image attention through key-value merging and combines them with those
from the original decoding, effectively mitigating attention degradation and
suppressing hallucinations while not incurring too much inference cost.
Extensive experiments on both hallucination and comprehensive benchmarks
demonstrate IKOD's superior effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations and
improving comprehensive capacities for LVLMs. Importantly, IKOD requires no
additional training or external tools, making it a lightweight and efficient
framework applicable to various models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成技术快速发展，可能被恶意用于误导活动，现有研究对视频内容的保护不足。

Method: 采用联合帧优化，将视频帧作为整体优化实体，并融合视频运动信息到优化目标中。

Result: VideoGuard的保护性能优于所有基线方法。

Conclusion: VideoGuard能有效保护视频内容免受未经授权的编辑。

Abstract: With the rapid development of generative technology, current generative
models can generate high-fidelity digital content and edit it in a controlled
manner. However, there is a risk that malicious individuals might misuse these
capabilities for misleading activities. Although existing research has
attempted to shield photographic images from being manipulated by generative
models, there remains a significant disparity in the protection offered to
video content editing. To bridge the gap, we propose a protection method named
VideoGuard, which can effectively protect videos from unauthorized malicious
editing. This protection is achieved through the subtle introduction of nearly
unnoticeable perturbations that interfere with the functioning of the intended
generative diffusion models. Due to the redundancy between video frames, and
inter-frame attention mechanism in video diffusion models, simply applying
image-based protection methods separately to every video frame can not shield
video from unauthorized editing. To tackle the above challenge, we adopt joint
frame optimization, treating all video frames as an optimization entity.
Furthermore, we extract video motion information and fuse it into optimization
objectives. Thus, these alterations can effectively force the models to produce
outputs that are implausible and inconsistent. We provide a pipeline to
optimize this perturbation. Finally, we use both objective metrics and
subjective metrics to demonstrate the efficacy of our method, and the results
show that the protection performance of VideoGuard is superior to all the
baseline methods.

Motivation: 研究文本到图像生成中对象层面的隐性人口统计偏见，填补现有研究主要关注人类描绘偏见的空白。

Method: 引入SODA框架，通过比较带人口统计提示和中性提示生成的2700张图像（来自三种先进模型），分析视觉属性差异。

Result: 发现模型输出中存在与性别、种族等人口统计提示相关的视觉属性模式，部分模型输出多样性不足加剧了偏见。

Conclusion: SODA框架为揭示生成模型中的刻板印象提供了实用方法，是推动更负责任AI发展的重要一步。

Abstract: While prior research on text-to-image generation has predominantly focused on
biases in human depictions, we investigate a more subtle yet pervasive
phenomenon: demographic bias in generated objects (e.g., cars). We introduce
SODA (Stereotyped Object Diagnostic Audit), a novel framework for
systematically measuring such biases. Our approach compares visual attributes
of objects generated with demographic cues (e.g., "for young people'') to those
from neutral prompts, across 2,700 images produced by three state-of-the-art
models (GPT Image-1, Imagen 4, and Stable Diffusion) in five object categories.
Through a comprehensive analysis, we uncover strong associations between
specific demographic groups and visual attributes, such as recurring color
patterns prompted by gender or ethnicity cues. These patterns reflect and
reinforce not only well-known stereotypes but also more subtle and unintuitive
biases. We also observe that some models generate less diverse outputs, which
in turn amplifies the visual disparities compared to neutral prompts. Our
proposed auditing framework offers a practical approach for testing, revealing
how stereotypes still remain embedded in today's generative models. We see this
as an essential step toward more systematic and responsible AI development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs)在文本到图像生成中表现出色，但其高计算成本和参数量在资源受限场景中难以应用。现有后训练量化方法在极低比特设置下性能下降严重。

Method: 提出LRQ-DiT框架，包括Twin-Log量化（TLQ）和自适应旋转方案（ARS），分别针对权重分布和激活异常进行优化。

Result: 在PixArt和FLUX等模型上验证，LRQ-DiT在低比特量化下保持了图像质量，优于现有后训练量化基线。

Conclusion: LRQ-DiT有效解决了DiT模型量化中的关键问题，为资源受限场景提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have achieved impressive performance in
text-to-image generation. However, their high computational cost and large
parameter sizes pose significant challenges for usage in resource-constrained
scenarios. Post-training quantization (PTQ) is a promising solution to reduce
memory usage and accelerate inference, but existing PTQ methods suffer from
severe performance degradation under extreme low-bit settings. We identify two
key obstacles to low-bit post-training quantization for DiT models: (1) model
weights follow a Gaussian-like distribution with long tails, causing uniform
quantization to poorly allocate intervals and leading to significant errors;
(2) two types of activation outliers: (i) Mild Outliers with slightly elevated
values, and (ii) Salient Outliers with large magnitudes concentrated in
specific channels, which disrupt activation quantization. To address these
issues, we propose LRQ-DiT, an efficient and accurate PTQ framework. We
introduce Twin-Log Quantization (TLQ), a log-based method that aligns well with
the weight distribution and reduces quantization errors. We also propose an
Adaptive Rotation Scheme (ARS) that dynamically applies Hadamard or
outlier-aware rotations based on activation fluctuation, effectively mitigating
the impact of both types of outliers. We evaluate LRQ-DiT on PixArt and FLUX
under various bit-width settings, and validate the performance on COCO, MJHQ,
and sDCI datasets. LRQ-DiT achieves low-bit quantization of DiT models while
preserving image quality, outperforming existing PTQ baselines.

Method: 提出ParticleSAM方法，基于分割基础模型改进，适用于密集小颗粒图像；同时通过自动化数据生成和标注流程创建新数据集。

Result: 实验结果表明，ParticleSAM在定量和定性实验中均优于原始SAM方法。

Conclusion: ParticleSAM在建筑材料质量监控中具有潜力，并可推广至其他需要小颗粒分割的领域。

Abstract: The construction industry represents a major sector in terms of resource
consumption. Recycled construction material has high reuse potential, but
quality monitoring of the aggregates is typically still performed with manual
methods. Vision-based machine learning methods could offer a faster and more
efficient solution to this problem, but existing segmentation methods are by
design not directly applicable to images with hundreds of small particles. In
this paper, we propose ParticleSAM, an adaptation of the segmentation
foundation model to images with small and dense objects such as the ones often
encountered in construction material particles. Moreover, we create a new dense
multi-particle dataset simulated from isolated particle images with the
assistance of an automated data generation and labeling pipeline. This dataset
serves as a benchmark for visual material quality control automation while our
segmentation approach has the potential to be valuable in application areas
beyond construction where small-particle segmentation is needed. Our
experimental results validate the advantages of our method by comparing to the
original SAM method both in quantitative and qualitative experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏性是SDL学习解决方案的重要特性，但如何平衡稀疏性与恢复质量尚不明确，本文旨在探讨这一问题。

Method: 通过多种优化方法（如迭代收缩算法）研究SDL中的稀疏性表现，并分析其对图像恢复的影响。

Result: 不同优化方法会导致不同的稀疏性表现，高稀疏性通常不会损害恢复质量，即使恢复图像与学习数据库差异较大。

Conclusion: 高稀疏性在SDL中是可取的，因为它不会显著影响恢复质量，同时能提升处理或存储效率。

Abstract: Sparse dictionary learning (SDL) is a fundamental technique that is useful
for many image processing tasks. As an example we consider here image recovery,
where SDL can be cast as a nonsmooth optimization problem. For this kind of
problems, iterative shrinkage methods represent a powerful class of algorithms
that are subject of ongoing research. Sparsity is an important property of the
learned solutions, as exactly the sparsity enables efficient further processing
or storage. The sparsity implies that a recovered image is determined as a
combination of a number of dictionary elements that is as low as possible.
Therefore, the question arises, to which degree sparsity should be enforced in
SDL in order to not compromise recovery quality. In this paper we focus on the
sparsity of solutions that can be obtained using a variety of optimization
methods. It turns out that there are different sparsity regimes depending on
the method in use. Furthermore, we illustrate that high sparsity does in
general not compromise recovery quality, even if the recovered image is quite
different from the learning database.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学数据固有的模糊性和变异性导致现有模型难以捕捉多层次的语义关系，检索结果不可靠。

Method: PECM框架引入多级原型和双流置信度估计，利用原型相似性分布和自适应权重机制减少高不确定性数据的影响。

Result: 在放射学图像-报告数据集上，检索精度和一致性显著提升，性能增益高达10.17%，达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: PECM有效处理数据模糊性，提升了复杂临床场景下的检索可靠性。

Abstract: In cross-modal retrieval tasks, such as image-to-report and report-to-image
retrieval, accurately aligning medical images with relevant text reports is
essential but challenging due to the inherent ambiguity and variability in
medical data. Existing models often struggle to capture the nuanced,
multi-level semantic relationships in radiology data, leading to unreliable
retrieval results. To address these issues, we propose the Prototype-Enhanced
Confidence Modeling (PECM) framework, which introduces multi-level prototypes
for each modality to better capture semantic variability and enhance retrieval
robustness. PECM employs a dual-stream confidence estimation that leverages
prototype similarity distributions and an adaptive weighting mechanism to
control the impact of high-uncertainty data on retrieval rankings. Applied to
radiology image-report datasets, our method achieves significant improvements
in retrieval precision and consistency, effectively handling data ambiguity and
advancing reliability in complex clinical scenarios. We report results on
multiple different datasets and tasks including fully supervised and zero-shot
retrieval obtaining performance gains of up to 10.17%, establishing in new
state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Instruction-based garment editing enables precise image modifications via
natural language, with broad applications in fashion design and customization.
Unlike general editing tasks, it requires understanding garment-specific
semantics and attribute dependencies. However, progress is limited by the
scarcity of high-quality instruction-image pairs, as manual annotation is
costly and hard to scale. While MLLMs have shown promise in automated data
synthesis, their application to garment editing is constrained by imprecise
instruction modeling and a lack of fashion-specific supervisory signals. To
address these challenges, we present an automated pipeline for constructing a
garment editing dataset. We first define six editing instruction categories
aligned with real-world fashion workflows to guide the generation of balanced
and diverse instruction-image triplets. Second, we introduce Fashion Edit
Score, a semantic-aware evaluation metric that captures semantic dependencies
between garment attributes and provides reliable supervision during
construction. Using this pipeline, we construct a total of 52,257 candidate
triplets and retain 20,596 high-quality triplets to build EditGarment, the
first instruction-based dataset tailored to standalone garment editing. The

Result: 在三个医学数据集上实现了精确分割，无需额外训练，性能优于传统方法。

Conclusion: MAUP为跨域少样本医学图像分割提供了一种高效、无需训练的解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-domain Few-shot Medical Image Segmentation (CD-FSMIS) is a potential
solution for segmenting medical images with limited annotation using knowledge
from other domains. The significant performance of current CD-FSMIS models
relies on the heavily training procedure over other source medical domains,
which degrades the universality and ease of model deployment. With the
development of large visual models of natural images, we propose a
training-free CD-FSMIS model that introduces the Multi-center Adaptive
Uncertainty-aware Prompting (MAUP) strategy for adapting the foundation model
Segment Anything Model (SAM), which is trained with natural images, into the
CD-FSMIS task. To be specific, MAUP consists of three key innovations: (1)
K-means clustering based multi-center prompts generation for comprehensive
spatial coverage, (2) uncertainty-aware prompts selection that focuses on the
challenging regions, and (3) adaptive prompt optimization that can dynamically
adjust according to the target region complexity. With the pre-trained DINOv2
feature encoder, MAUP achieves precise segmentation results across three
medical datasets without any additional training compared with several
conventional CD-FSMIS models and training-free FSMIS model. The source code is

Conclusion: DKUA框架通过域风格建模和知识统一，显著提升了终身行人重识别的性能。

Abstract: Lifelong person re-identification (LReID) encounters a key challenge:
balancing the preservation of old knowledge with adaptation to new information.
Existing LReID methods typically employ knowledge distillation to enforce
representation alignment. However, these approaches ignore two crucial aspects:
specific distribution awareness and cross-domain unified knowledge learning,
both of which are essential for addressing this challenge. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a novel distribution-aware knowledge unification and
association (DKUA) framework where domain-style modeling is performed for each
instance to propagate domain-specific representations, enhancing
anti-forgetting and generalization capacity. Specifically, we design a
distribution-aware model to transfer instance-level representations of the
current domain into the domain-specific representations with the different
domain styles, preserving learned knowledge without storing old samples. Next,
we propose adaptive knowledge consolidation (AKC) to dynamically generate the
unified representation as a cross-domain representation center. To further
mitigate forgetting, we develop a unified knowledge association (UKA)
mechanism, which explores the unified representation as a bridge to explicitly
model inter-domain associations, reducing inter-domain gaps. Finally,
distribution-based knowledge transfer (DKT) is proposed to prevent the current
domain distribution from deviating from the cross-domain distribution center,
improving adaptation capacity. Experimental results show our DKUA outperforms
the existing methods by 7.6%/5.3% average mAP/R@1 improvement on
anti-forgetting and generalization capacity, respectively. Our code will be
publicly released.

Result: 在三个病理数据集上，SemanticStitcher在正确边界匹配上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SemanticStitcher为病理学中的自动拼接提供了鲁棒且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: In histopathology, tissue samples are often larger than a standard microscope
slide, making stitching of multiple fragments necessary to process entire
structures such as tumors. Automated stitching is a prerequisite for scaling
analysis, but is challenging due to possible tissue loss during preparation,
inhomogeneous morphological distortion, staining inconsistencies, missing
regions due to misalignment on the slide, or frayed tissue edges. This limits
state-of-the-art stitching methods using boundary shape matching algorithms to
reconstruct artificial whole mount slides (WMS). Here, we introduce
SemanticStitcher using latent feature representations derived from a visual
histopathology foundation model to identify neighboring areas in different
fragments. Robust pose estimation based on a large number of semantic matching
candidates derives a mosaic of multiple fragments to form the WMS. Experiments
on three different histopathology datasets demonstrate that SemanticStitcher
yields robust WMS mosaicing and consistently outperforms the state of the art
in correct boundary matches.

Abstract: Emotional Image Content Generation (EICG) aims to generate semantically clear
and emotionally faithful images based on given emotion categories, with broad
application prospects. While recent text-to-image diffusion models excel at
generating concrete concepts, they struggle with the complexity of abstract
emotions. There have also emerged methods specifically designed for EICG, but
they excessively rely on word-level attribute labels for guidance, which suffer
from semantic incoherence, ambiguity, and limited scalability. To address these
challenges, we propose CoEmoGen, a novel pipeline notable for its semantic
coherence and high scalability. Specifically, leveraging multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), we construct high-quality captions focused on
emotion-triggering content for context-rich semantic guidance. Furthermore,
inspired by psychological insights, we design a Hierarchical Low-Rank
Adaptation (HiLoRA) module to cohesively model both polarity-shared low-level
features and emotion-specific high-level semantics. Extensive experiments
demonstrate CoEmoGen's superiority in emotional faithfulness and semantic
coherence from quantitative, qualitative, and user study perspectives. To
intuitively showcase scalability, we curate EmoArt, a large-scale dataset of
emotionally evocative artistic images, providing endless inspiration for
emotion-driven artistic creation. The dataset and code are available at

Abstract: Retinal microvascular imaging is increasingly recognised as a non invasive
method for evaluating systemic vascular and metabolic health. However, the
association between lipidomics and retinal vasculature remains inadequate. This
study investigates the relationships between serum lipid subclasses, free fatty
acids (FA), diacylglycerols (DAG), triacylglycerols (TAG), and cholesteryl
esters (CE), and retinal microvascular characteristics in a large
population-based cohort. Using Spearman correlation analysis, we examined the
interconnection between lipid subclasses and ten retinal microvascular traits,
applying the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (BH-FDR) to adjust for
statistical significance.
  Results indicated that FA were linked to retinal vessel twistiness, while CE
correlated with the average widths of arteries and veins. Conversely, DAG and
TAG showed negative correlations with the width and complexity of arterioles
and venules. These findings suggest that retinal vascular architecture reflects
distinct circulating lipid profiles, supporting its role as a non-invasive
marker of systemic metabolic health. This study is the first to integrate deep
learning (DL)derived retinal traits with lipidomic subclasses in a healthy
cohort, thereby providing insights into microvascular structural changes
independent of disease status or treatment effects.

images via token-anchored latent editing. Leveraging a hard-gated
auto-regressive operator and a training-free, context-preserving masked
sampling kernel, ARAS significantly enhances defect realism, preserves
fine-grained material textures, and provides continuous semantic control over
synthesized anomalies. Integrated within our Quality-Aware Re-weighted Anomaly
Detection (QARAD) framework, we further propose a dynamic weighting strategy
that emphasizes high-quality synthetic samples by computing an image-text
similarity score with a dual-encoder model. Extensive experiments across three
benchmark datasets-MVTec AD, VisA, and BTAD, demonstrate that our QARAD
outperforms SOTA methods in both image- and pixel-level anomaly detection
tasks, achieving improved accuracy, robustness, and a 5 times synthesis speedup
compared to diffusion-based alternatives. Our complete code and synthesized
dataset will be publicly available.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种开源大规模数据集，用于将口语数学表达式转换为LaTeX，解决了现有方法的局限性，并在多个基准测试中取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决口语数学表达式转换为LaTeX的挑战，特别是在教育和研究领域的应用需求。现有方法存在数据不足、多语言支持缺乏等问题。

Method: 基于ASR后校正模型和音频语言模型，结合少样本提示，构建了一个包含66,000个标注样本的多语言数据集。

Result: 在MathSpeech基准测试中CER为28%（对比30%），在S2L-equations基准测试中显著优于现有模型（27% vs. 64%）。

Conclusion: 该研究为数学内容识别的多模态AI奠定了基础，并提供了首个数学句子识别基准。

Abstract: Conversion of spoken mathematical expressions is a challenging task that
involves transcribing speech into a strictly structured symbolic representation
while addressing the ambiguity inherent in the pronunciation of equations.
Although significant progress has been achieved in automatic speech recognition
(ASR) and language models (LM), the problem of converting spoken mathematics
into LaTeX remains underexplored. This task directly applies to educational and
research domains, such as lecture transcription or note creation. Based on ASR
post-correction, prior work requires 2 transcriptions, focuses only on isolated
equations, has a limited test set, and provides neither training data nor
multilingual coverage. To address these issues, we present the first fully
open-source large-scale dataset, comprising over 66,000 human-annotated audio
samples of mathematical equations and sentences in both English and Russian,
drawn from diverse scientific domains. In addition to the ASR post-correction
models and few-shot prompting, we apply audio language models, demonstrating
comparable character error rate (CER) results on the MathSpeech benchmark (28%
vs. 30%) for the equations conversion. In contrast, on the proposed
S2L-equations benchmark, our models outperform the MathSpeech model by a
substantial margin of more than 40 percentage points, even after accounting for
LaTeX formatting artifacts (27% vs. 64%). We establish the first benchmark for
mathematical sentence recognition (S2L-sentences) and achieve an equation CER
of 40%. This work lays the groundwork for future advances in multimodal AI,
with a particular focus on mathematical content recognition.

TL;DR: 使用无人机和红外/RGB图像估算奥地利东南部野生动物密度，与传统相机陷阱方法对比，结果显示无人机方法高效且可扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统野生动物密度估算方法（如捕获-再捕获、距离采样或相机陷阱）劳动密集或空间受限，无人机提供了一种高效、非侵入性的替代方案。

Method: 在无叶期使用无人机进行航测，飞行高度60米，结合手动标注和三种密度外推方法（简单面积外推、自助法和零膨胀负二项模型），并与相机陷阱的随机遭遇模型（REM）对比。

Result: 无人机方法估算的密度与REM相似，通常更高，但10月某区域例外，推测无人机反映白天活动，而REM反映长期平均活动。

Conclusion: 无人机为野生动物密度估算提供了高效、可扩展的新方法，与传统方法互补。

Abstract: We use unmanned aerial drones to estimate wildlife density in southeastern
Austria and compare these estimates to camera trap data. Traditional methods
like capture-recapture, distance sampling, or camera traps are well-established
but labour-intensive or spatially constrained. Using thermal (IR) and RGB
imagery, drones enable efficient, non-intrusive animal counting. Our surveys
were conducted during the leafless period on single days in October and
November 2024 in three areas of a sub-Illyrian hill and terrace landscape.
Flight transects were based on predefined launch points using a 350 m grid and
an algorithm that defined the direction of systematically randomized transects.
This setup allowed surveying large areas in one day using multiple drones,
minimizing double counts. Flight altitude was set at 60 m to avoid disturbing
roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) while ensuring detection. Animals were manually
annotated in the recorded imagery and extrapolated to densities per square
kilometer. We applied three extrapolation methods with increasing complexity:
naive area-based extrapolation, bootstrapping, and zero-inflated negative
binomial modelling. For comparison, a Random Encounter Model (REM) estimate was
calculated using camera trap data from the flight period. The drone-based
methods yielded similar results, generally showing higher densities than REM,
except in one area in October. We hypothesize that drone-based density reflects
daytime activity in open and forested areas, while REM estimates average
activity over longer periods within forested zones. Although both approaches
estimate density, they offer different perspectives on wildlife presence. Our
results show that drones offer a promising, scalable method for wildlife
density estimation.

Motivation: 解决现有方法在城市区域的高计算成本问题，适应农村地区稀疏建筑分布的需求。

Method: 采用分层机器学习方法：先用CNN分类器过滤无建筑区域，再用CNN分割算法提取建筑特征。

Result: 在爱尔兰历史地图上验证，性能高效，发现了一个可能在大饥荒时期被废弃的定居点。

Conclusion: 该方法为历史和考古研究提供了高效工具，特别适合农村地区的大规模分析。

Abstract: Historical maps offer a valuable lens through which to study past landscapes
and settlement patterns. While prior research has leveraged machine learning
based techniques to extract building footprints from historical maps, such
approaches have largely focused on urban areas and tend to be computationally
intensive. This presents a challenge for research questions requiring analysis
across extensive rural regions, such as verifying historical census data or
locating abandoned settlements. In this paper, this limitation is addressed by
proposing a scalable and efficient pipeline tailored to rural maps with sparse
building distributions. The method described employs a hierarchical machine
learning based approach: convolutional neural network (CNN) classifiers are
first used to progressively filter out map sections unlikely to contain
buildings, significantly reducing the area requiring detailed analysis. The
remaining high probability sections are then processed using CNN segmentation
algorithms to extract building features. The pipeline is validated using test
sections from the Ordnance Survey Ireland historical 25 inch map series and 6
inch map series, demonstrating both high performance and improved efficiency
compared to conventional segmentation-only approaches. Application of the
technique to both map series, covering the same geographic region, highlights
its potential for historical and archaeological discovery. Notably, the
pipeline identified a settlement of approximately 22 buildings in Tully, Co.
Galway, present in the 6 inch map, produced in 1839, but absent from the 25
inch map, produced in 1899, suggesting it may have been abandoned during the
Great Famine period.

Abstract: Recent studies have highlighted the potential of adapting the Segment
Anything Model (SAM) for various downstream tasks. However, constructing a more
powerful and generalizable encoder to further enhance performance remains an
open challenge. In this work, we propose SAM2-UNeXT, an advanced framework that
builds upon the core principles of SAM2-UNet while extending the
representational capacity of SAM2 through the integration of an auxiliary
DINOv2 encoder. By incorporating a dual-resolution strategy and a dense glue
layer, our approach enables more accurate segmentation with a simple
architecture, relaxing the need for complex decoder designs. Extensive
experiments conducted on four benchmarks, including dichotomous image
segmentation, camouflaged object detection, marine animal segmentation, and
remote sensing saliency detection, demonstrate the superior performance of our
proposed method. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 雷达姿态估计具有隐私保护和光照不变性，但受噪声和多路径效应影响，需要更可靠的方法。

Method: 使用概率编码-解码架构（RadProPoser），结合变分推理和关键点回归，预测3D关节位置及不确定性。

Conclusion: RadProPoser是首个端到端雷达姿态估计系统，为可靠的人体运动分析奠定了基础。

Abstract: Radar-based human pose estimation (HPE) provides a privacy-preserving,
illumination-invariant sensing modality but is challenged by noisy,
multipath-affected measurements. We introduce RadProPoser, a probabilistic
encoder-decoder architecture that processes complex-valued radar tensors from a
compact 3-transmitter, 4-receiver MIMO radar. By incorporating variational
inference into keypoint regression, RadProPoser jointly predicts 26
three-dimensional joint locations alongside heteroscedastic aleatoric
uncertainties and can be recalibrated to predict total uncertainty. We explore
different probabilistic formulations using both Gaussian and Laplace
distributions for latent priors and likelihoods. On our newly released dataset
with optical motion-capture ground truth, RadProPoser achieves an overall mean
per-joint position error (MPJPE) of 6.425 cm, with 5.678 cm at the 45 degree
aspect angle. The learned uncertainties exhibit strong alignment with actual
pose errors and can be calibrated to produce reliable prediction intervals,
with our best configuration achieving an expected calibration error of 0.021.
As an additional demonstration, sampling from these latent distributions
enables effective data augmentation for downstream activity classification,
resulting in an F1 score of 0.870. To our knowledge, this is the first
end-to-end radar tensor-based HPE system to explicitly model and quantify
per-joint uncertainty from raw radar tensor data, establishing a foundation for
explainable and reliable human motion analysis in radar applications.

Result: MetaScope在超透镜分割和图像恢复任务中优于现有方法，并在真实生物医学场景中表现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: MetaScope为超透镜内窥镜提供了一种高效解决方案，推动了微型内窥镜技术的发展。

Abstract: Miniaturized endoscopy has advanced accurate visual perception within the
human body. Prevailing research remains limited to conventional cameras
employing convex lenses, where the physical constraints with millimetre-scale
thickness impose serious impediments on the micro-level clinical. Recently,
with the emergence of meta-optics, ultra-micro imaging based on metalenses
(micron-scale) has garnered great attention, serving as a promising solution.
However, due to the physical difference of metalens, there is a large gap in
data acquisition and algorithm research. In light of this, we aim to bridge
this unexplored gap, advancing the novel metalens endoscopy. First, we
establish datasets for metalens endoscopy and conduct preliminary optical
simulation, identifying two derived optical issues that physically adhere to
strong optical priors. Second, we propose MetaScope, a novel optics-driven
neural network tailored for metalens endoscopy driven by physical optics.
MetaScope comprises two novel designs: Optics-informed Intensity Adjustment
(OIA), rectifying intensity decay by learning optical embeddings, and
Optics-informed Chromatic Correction (OCC), mitigating chromatic aberration by
learning spatial deformations informed by learned Point Spread Function (PSF)
distributions. To enhance joint learning, we further deploy a gradient-guided
distillation to transfer knowledge from the foundational model adaptively.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MetaScope not only outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both metalens segmentation and restoration but also
achieves impressive generalized ability in real biomedical scenes.

Motivation: 静态融合启发式和类别无关注意力在动态场景（如遮挡、杂乱和类别不平衡）中表现不佳，需要更灵活的解决方案。

Method: DyCAF-Net采用输入条件平衡颈部、双动态注意力机制和类别感知特征适应三项创新技术。

Conclusion: DyCAF-Net因其对尺度变化、语义重叠和类别不平衡的适应性，成为医学影像、监控和自动驾驶等实际检测任务的稳健解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in object detection rely on modular architectures with
multi-scale fusion and attention mechanisms. However, static fusion heuristics
and class-agnostic attention limit performance in dynamic scenes with
occlusions, clutter, and class imbalance. We introduce Dynamic Class-Aware
Fusion Network (DyCAF-Net) that addresses these challenges through three
innovations: (1) an input-conditioned equilibrium-based neck that iteratively
refines multi-scale features via implicit fixed-point modeling, (2) a dual
dynamic attention mechanism that adaptively recalibrates channel and spatial
responses using input- and class-dependent cues, and (3) class-aware feature
adaptation that modulates features to prioritize discriminative regions for
rare classes. Through comprehensive ablation studies with YOLOv8 and related
architectures, alongside benchmarking against nine state-of-the-art baselines,
DyCAF-Net achieves significant improvements in precision, mAP@50, and mAP@50-95
across 13 diverse benchmarks, including occlusion-heavy and long-tailed
datasets. The framework maintains computational efficiency ($\sim$11.1M
parameters) and competitive inference speeds, while its adaptability to scale
variance, semantic overlaps, and class imbalance positions it as a robust
solution for real-world detection tasks in medical imaging, surveillance, and
autonomous systems.

Conclusion: CloudBreaker为多光谱数据不可靠的遥感应用提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Cloud cover and nighttime conditions remain significant limitations in
satellite-based remote sensing, often restricting the availability and
usability of multi-spectral imagery. In contrast, Sentinel-1 radar images are
unaffected by cloud cover and can provide consistent data regardless of weather
or lighting conditions. To address the challenges of limited satellite imagery,
we propose CloudBreaker, a novel framework that generates high-quality
multi-spectral Sentinel-2 signals from Sentinel-1 data. This includes the
reconstruction of optical (RGB) images as well as critical vegetation and water
indices such as NDVI and NDWI.We employed a novel multi-stage training approach
based on conditional latent flow matching and, to the best of our knowledge,
are the first to integrate cosine scheduling with flow matching. CloudBreaker
demonstrates strong performance, achieving a Frechet Inception Distance (FID)
score of 0.7432, indicating high fidelity and realism in the generated optical
imagery. The model also achieved Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) of
0.6156 for NDWI and 0.6874 for NDVI, indicating a high degree of structural
similarity. This establishes CloudBreaker as a promising solution for a wide
range of remote sensing applications where multi-spectral data is typically
unavailable or unreliable

Conclusion: evTransFER框架显著提升了事件相机在表情识别中的性能，证明了迁移学习和时空动态捕捉的有效性。

Abstract: Event-based cameras are bio-inspired vision sensors that asynchronously
capture per-pixel intensity changes with microsecond latency, high temporal
resolution, and high dynamic range, providing valuable information about the
spatio-temporal dynamics of the scene. In the present work, we propose
evTransFER, a transfer learning-based framework and architecture for face
expression recognition using event-based cameras. The main contribution is a
feature extractor designed to encode the spatio-temporal dynamics of faces,
built by training an adversarial generative method on a different problem
(facial reconstruction) and then transferring the trained encoder weights to
the face expression recognition system. We show that this proposed transfer
learning method greatly improves the ability to recognize facial expressions
compared to training a network from scratch. In addition, we propose an
architecture that incorporates an LSTM to capture longer-term facial expression
dynamics, and we introduce a new event-based representation, referred to as
TIE, both of which further improve the results. We evaluate the proposed
framework on the event-based facial expression database e-CK+ and compare it to
state-of-the-art methods. The results show that the proposed framework
evTransFER achieves a 93.6\% recognition rate on the e-CK+ database,
significantly improving the accuracy (25.9\% points or more) when compared to
state-of-the-art performance for similar problems.

rotation and translation from a single image has been widely investigated yet
remains computationally demanding, limiting applicability in
resource-constrained scenarios. FPG-NAS addresses this by proposing a
specialized differentiable NAS approach for 6DoF pose estimation, featuring a
task-specific search space and a differentiable gating mechanism that enables
discrete multi-candidate operator selection, thus improving architectural
diversity. Additionally, a FLOPs regularization term ensures a balanced
trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. The framework explores a vast search
space of approximately 10\textsuperscript{92} possible architectures.
Experiments on the LINEMOD and SPEED+ datasets demonstrate that FPG-NAS-derived

Abstract: Reconstructing and semantically interpreting 3D scenes from sparse 2D views
remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. Conventional methods often
decouple semantic understanding from reconstruction or necessitate costly
per-scene optimization, thereby restricting their scalability and
generalizability. In this paper, we introduce Uni3R, a novel feed-forward
framework that jointly reconstructs a unified 3D scene representation enriched
with open-vocabulary semantics, directly from unposed multi-view images. Our
approach leverages a Cross-View Transformer to robustly integrate information
across arbitrary multi-view inputs, which then regresses a set of 3D Gaussian
primitives endowed with semantic feature fields. This unified representation
facilitates high-fidelity novel view synthesis, open-vocabulary 3D semantic
segmentation, and depth prediction, all within a single, feed-forward pass.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Uni3R establishes a new state-of-the-art
across multiple benchmarks, including 25.07 PSNR on RE10K and 55.84 mIoU on
ScanNet. Our work signifies a novel paradigm towards generalizable, unified 3D

Conclusion: LongVie为可控长视频生成提供了一种有效的解决方案，并通过LongVGenBench验证了其性能。

Abstract: Controllable ultra-long video generation is a fundamental yet challenging
task. Although existing methods are effective for short clips, they struggle to
scale due to issues such as temporal inconsistency and visual degradation. In
this paper, we initially investigate and identify three key factors: separate
noise initialization, independent control signal normalization, and the
limitations of single-modality guidance. To address these issues, we propose
LongVie, an end-to-end autoregressive framework for controllable long video
generation. LongVie introduces two core designs to ensure temporal consistency:
1) a unified noise initialization strategy that maintains consistent generation
across clips, and 2) global control signal normalization that enforces
alignment in the control space throughout the entire video. To mitigate visual
degradation, LongVie employs 3) a multi-modal control framework that integrates
both dense (e.g., depth maps) and sparse (e.g., keypoints) control signals,
complemented by 4) a degradation-aware training strategy that adaptively
balances modality contributions over time to preserve visual quality. We also
introduce LongVGenBench, a comprehensive benchmark consisting of 100
high-resolution videos spanning diverse real-world and synthetic environments,
each lasting over one minute. Extensive experiments show that LongVie achieves
state-of-the-art performance in long-range controllability, consistency, and

Abstract: Video understanding requires effective modeling of both motion and appearance

novel approach that transforms trajectory points into semantic-aware relational
tokens for action recognition. First, we introduce a semantic-aware sampling
strategy to adaptively distribute tracking points based on object scale and
semantic relevance. Second, we develop a motion modeling framework that
captures both intra-trajectory dynamics through the Histogram of Oriented
Displacements (HoD) and inter-trajectory relationships to model complex action
patterns. Our approach effectively combines these trajectory tokens with
semantic features to enhance appearance features with motion information,
achieving state-of-the-art performance across six diverse few-shot action
recognition benchmarks: Something-Something-V2 (both full and small splits),
Kinetics, UCF101, HMDB51, and FineGym. For project page see

### [234] [A Bayesian Hybrid Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning Method for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02711)
*Yidong Chai,Yang Liu,Yonghang Zhou,Jiaheng Xie,Daniel Dajun Zeng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为BH-PEFT的新方法，将贝叶斯学习融入混合参数高效微调（PEFT），以解决现有方法在不确定性量化和动态适应性方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在专业应用中需要高效微调，但现有混合PEFT方法缺乏不确定性量化和动态适应能力。

Method: 结合Adapter、LoRA和prefix-tuning技术，通过贝叶斯学习将可学习参数建模为分布，并提出动态微调方法。

Result: 在情感分析、新闻分类等任务中表现优于现有PEFT基线，支持不确定性量化和动态适应性。

Conclusion: BH-PEFT为商业分析和数据科学提供了一种支持不确定性感知和自适应决策的新方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated transformative potential in
reshaping the world. As these models are pretrained on general corpora, they
often require domain-specific fine-tuning to optimize performance in
specialized business applications. Due to their massive scale,
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods are widely used to reduce
training costs. Among them, hybrid PEFT methods that combine multiple PEFT
techniques have achieved the best performance. However, existing hybrid PEFT
methods face two main challenges when fine-tuning LLMs for specialized
applications: (1) relying on point estimates, lacking the ability to quantify
uncertainty for reliable decision-making, and (2) struggling to dynamically
adapt to emerging data, lacking the ability to suit real-world situations. We
propose Bayesian Hybrid Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (BH-PEFT), a novel
method that integrates Bayesian learning into hybrid PEFT. BH-PEFT combines
Adapter, LoRA, and prefix-tuning to fine-tune feedforward and attention layers
of the Transformer. By modeling learnable parameters as distributions, BH-PEFT
enables uncertainty quantification. We further propose a Bayesian dynamic
fine-tuning approach where the last posterior serves as the prior for the next
round, enabling effective adaptation to new data. We evaluated BH-PEFT on
business tasks such as sentiment analysis, news categorization, and commonsense
reasoning. Results show that our method outperforms existing PEFT baselines,
enables uncertainty quantification for more reliable decisions, and improves
adaptability in dynamic scenarios. This work contributes to business analytics
and data science by proposing a novel BH-PEFT method and dynamic fine-tuning
approach that support uncertainty-aware and adaptive decision-making in
real-world situations.

Motivation: 解决Adam优化器在噪声或高粒度分类任务中的局限性，提出更高效、鲁棒的替代方案。

Method: 结合动态缩放、自适应阻尼、余弦相似度动量增强、熵正则化损失和SAM扰动。

Result: 在多个数据集上测试准确率优于Adam，计算高效且鲁棒。

Conclusion: ZetA是Adam的有效替代，特别适用于噪声或高粒度分类任务。

Abstract: This work introduces ZetA, a novel deep learning optimizer that extends Adam
by incorporating dynamic scaling based on the Riemann zeta function. To the
best of our knowledge, ZetA is the first optimizer to apply zeta-based gradient
scaling within deep learning optimization. The method improves generalization
and robustness through a hybrid update mechanism that integrates adaptive
damping, cosine similarity-based momentum boosting, entropy-regularized loss,
and Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM)-style perturbations. Empirical
evaluations on SVHN, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, STL10, and noisy CIFAR10 consistently
show test accuracy improvements over Adam. All experiments employ a lightweight
fully connected network trained for five epochs under mixed-precision settings.
The results demonstrate that ZetA is a computationally efficient and robust
alternative to Adam, particularly effective in noisy or high-granularity
classification tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将传统医疗转变为更精准的个性化范式，同时保留群体级ECG合成的优势。

Method: 第一阶段通过对比学习提取个体特征，第二阶段通过AdaX Condition Injector将特征和条件注入扩散模型。

Result: 模型能生成高保真、多样化的ECG信号，并保留个体特征，提升下游自动诊断能力。

Conclusion: ECGTwin展示了精准个性化医疗的潜力。

Abstract: Personalized electrocardiogram (ECG) generation is to simulate a patient's
ECG digital twins tailored to specific conditions. It has the potential to
transform traditional healthcare into a more accurate individualized paradigm,
while preserving the key benefits of conventional population-level ECG
synthesis. However, this promising task presents two fundamental challenges:
extracting individual features without ground truth and injecting various types
of conditions without confusing generative model. In this paper, we present
ECGTwin, a two-stage framework designed to address these challenges. In the
first stage, an Individual Base Extractor trained via contrastive learning
robustly captures personal features from a reference ECG. In the second stage,
the extracted individual features, along with a target cardiac condition, are
integrated into the diffusion-based generation process through our novel AdaX
Condition Injector, which injects these signals via two dedicated and
specialized pathways. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments have
demonstrated that our model can not only generate ECG signals of high fidelity
and diversity by offering a fine-grained generation controllability, but also
preserving individual-specific features. Furthermore, ECGTwin shows the
potential to enhance ECG auto-diagnosis in downstream application, confirming
the possibility of precise personalized healthcare solutions.

Abstract: In this research, I explore advanced deep learning methodologies to forecast
the outcomes of the 2025 NCAA Division 1 Men's and Women's Basketball
tournaments. Leveraging historical NCAA game data, I implement two
sophisticated sequence-based models: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and
Transformer architectures. The predictive power of these models is augmented
through comprehensive feature engineering, including team quality metrics
derived from Generalized Linear Models (GLM), Elo ratings, seed differences,
and aggregated box-score statistics. To evaluate the robustness and reliability
of predictions, I train each model variant using both Binary Cross-Entropy
(BCE) and Brier loss functions, providing insights into classification
performance and probability calibration. My comparative analysis reveals that
while the Transformer architecture optimized with BCE yields superior
discriminative power (highest AUC of 0.8473), the LSTM model trained with Brier
loss demonstrates superior probabilistic calibration (lowest Brier score of
0.1589). These findings underscore the importance of selecting appropriate
model architectures and loss functions based on the specific requirements of
forecasting tasks. The detailed analytical pipeline presented here serves as a
reproducible framework for future predictive modeling tasks in sports analytics

Conclusion: DeepGB-TB结合AI创新与公共卫生需求，为全球结核病控制提供了高效、可靠的工具。

Abstract: Large-scale tuberculosis (TB) screening is limited by the high cost and
operational complexity of traditional diagnostics, creating a need for
artificial-intelligence solutions. We propose DeepGB-TB, a non-invasive system
that instantly assigns TB risk scores using only cough audio and basic
demographic data. The model couples a lightweight one-dimensional convolutional
neural network for audio processing with a gradient-boosted decision tree for
tabular features. Its principal innovation is a Cross-Modal Bidirectional
Cross-Attention module (CM-BCA) that iteratively exchanges salient cues between
modalities, emulating the way clinicians integrate symptoms and risk factors.
To meet the clinical priority of minimizing missed cases, we design a
Tuberculosis Risk-Balanced Loss (TRBL) that places stronger penalties on
false-negative predictions, thereby reducing high-risk misclassifications.
DeepGB-TB is evaluated on a diverse dataset of 1,105 patients collected across
seven countries, achieving an AUROC of 0.903 and an F1-score of 0.851,
representing a new state of the art. Its computational efficiency enables
real-time, offline inference directly on common mobile devices, making it ideal
for low-resource settings. Importantly, the system produces clinically
validated explanations that promote trust and adoption by frontline health
workers. By coupling AI innovation with public-health requirements for speed,
affordability, and reliability, DeepGB-TB offers a tool for advancing global TB
control.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种在线学习方法RONAVI，用于解决多智能体系统在现实环境中的模型不匹配问题，通过优化最坏情况性能提升系统鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体系统在现实环境中可能因训练与部署环境的不匹配而失效，现有方法依赖模拟器或离线数据，限制了其应用。

Method: 提出RONAVI算法，支持在线学习，无需先验数据，直接通过环境交互学习。

Result: 理论分析表明，RONAVI在Total Variation和Kullback-Leibler散度下能实现低遗憾并找到最优鲁棒策略。

Conclusion: RONAVI为开发真正鲁棒的多智能体系统提供了新途径。

Abstract: Well-trained multi-agent systems can fail when deployed in real-world
environments due to model mismatches between the training and deployment
environments, caused by environment uncertainties including noise or
adversarial attacks. Distributionally Robust Markov Games (DRMGs) enhance
system resilience by optimizing for worst-case performance over a defined set
of environmental uncertainties. However, current methods are limited by their
dependence on simulators or large offline datasets, which are often
unavailable. This paper pioneers the study of online learning in DRMGs, where
agents learn directly from environmental interactions without prior data. We
introduce the {\it Robust Optimistic Nash Value Iteration (RONAVI)} algorithm
and provide the first provable guarantees for this setting. Our theoretical
analysis demonstrates that the algorithm achieves low regret and efficiently
finds the optimal robust policy for uncertainty sets measured by Total
Variation divergence and Kullback-Leibler divergence. These results establish a
new, practical path toward developing truly robust multi-agent systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于混合密度网络（MDN）的概率建模框架，用于解决FeFETs的随机性问题，提高了建模的准确性和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FeFETs在内存和逻辑技术中潜力巨大，但其固有的随机性（来自操作循环和制造变异性）对准确建模提出了挑战，现有模型难以全面捕捉这种变异性或缺乏数学平滑性。

Method: 采用混合密度网络（MDN）框架，结合C-infinity连续激活函数和设备特定嵌入层，以平滑稳定地学习并捕捉设备间的物理变异性。

Result: 模型在捕捉FeFET电流行为变异性方面表现出高准确性（R2=0.92），并能生成合成设备实例进行变异性感知模拟。

Conclusion: 该框架为FeFETs的全面随机行为建模提供了可扩展的数据驱动解决方案，为未来紧凑模型开发和电路模拟集成奠定了坚实基础。

Abstract: FeFETs hold strong potential for advancing memory and logic technologies, but
their inherent randomness arising from both operational cycling and fabrication
variability poses significant challenges for accurate and reliable modeling.
Capturing this variability is critical, as it enables designers to predict
behavior, optimize performance, and ensure reliability and robustness against
variations in manufacturing and operating conditions. Existing deterministic
and machine learning-based compact models often fail to capture the full extent
of this variability or lack the mathematical smoothness required for stable
circuit-level integration. In this work, we present an enhanced probabilistic
modeling framework for FeFETs that addresses these limitations. Building upon a
Mixture Density Network (MDN) foundation, our approach integrates C-infinity
continuous activation functions for smooth, stable learning and a
device-specific embedding layer to capture intrinsic physical variability
across devices. Sampling from the learned embedding distribution enables the
generation of synthetic device instances for variability-aware simulation. With
an R2 of 0.92, the model demonstrates high accuracy in capturing the
variability of FeFET current behavior. Altogether, this framework provides a
scalable, data-driven solution for modeling the full stochastic behavior of
FeFETs and offers a strong foundation for future compact model development and
circuit simulation integration.

Abstract: Pavement deterioration modeling is important in providing information
regarding the future state of the road network and in determining the needs of
preventive maintenance or rehabilitation treatments. This research incorporated
spatial dependence of road network into pavement deterioration modeling through
a graph neural network (GNN). The key motivation of using a GNN for pavement
performance modeling is the ability to easily and directly exploit the rich
structural information in the network. This paper explored if considering
spatial structure of the road network will improve the prediction performance
of the deterioration models. The data used in this research comprises a large

We implement and evaluate all algorithms on two standardized datasets: an
unlabeled set from a 241Am-9Be source and a time-of-flight labeled set from a
238Pu-9Be source, using metrics including Figure of Merit (FOM), F1-score,

models, particularly Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) and hybrid approaches
combining statistical features with neural regression, often outperform
traditional methods. We discuss architectural suitabilities, the limitations of
FOM, alternative evaluation metrics, and performance across energy thresholds.
Accompanying this work, we release an open-source toolbox in Python and MATLAB,
along with the datasets, to promote reproducibility and advance PSD research.

TL;DR: SmallKV通过小模型辅助补偿机制解决KV缓存淘汰中的动态注意力模式和边际信息压缩问题，显著提升LLM在资源受限环境下的性能和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KV缓存淘汰方法无法适应解码时的动态注意力模式（显著性偏移问题），且对边际重要令牌处理不当（边际信息过度压缩问题）。

Method: 设计两种补偿机制，利用不同规模LLM间注意力矩阵的高相似性，提出SmallKV方法，通过小模型辅助感知全局重要信息并近似边际令牌的注意力分数。

Result: 在GSM8K、BBH、MT-Bench和LongBench等基准测试中验证了SmallKV的有效性，吞吐量比基线方法高1.75-2.56倍。

Conclusion: SmallKV在资源受限环境下实现了高效且高性能的LLM推理，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: KV cache eviction has emerged as an effective solution to alleviate resource
constraints faced by LLMs in long-context scenarios. However, existing
token-level eviction methods often overlook two critical aspects: (1) their
irreversible eviction strategy fails to adapt to dynamic attention patterns
during decoding (the saliency shift problem), and (2) they treat both
marginally important tokens and truly unimportant tokens equally, despite the
collective significance of marginal tokens to model performance (the marginal
information over-compression problem). To address these issues, we design two
compensation mechanisms based on the high similarity of attention matrices
between LLMs of different scales. We propose SmallKV, a small model assisted
compensation method for KV cache compression. SmallKV can maintain attention
matching between different-scale LLMs to: 1) assist the larger model in
perceiving globally important information of attention; and 2) use the smaller
model's attention scores to approximate those of marginal tokens in the larger
model. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including GSM8K, BBH, MT-Bench, and
LongBench demonstrate the effectiveness of SmallKV. Moreover, efficiency
evaluations show that SmallKV achieves 1.75 - 2.56 times higher throughput than
baseline methods, highlighting its potential for efficient and performant LLM
inference in resource constrained environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在建模复杂时间依赖时存在静态分解策略、依赖建模碎片化和融合机制不灵活的局限性。

Method: DMSC包含多尺度块分解（EMPD）、三元交互块（TIB）和自适应尺度路由MoE块（ASR-MoE），动态分解序列并建模多尺度依赖。

Result: 在13个真实基准测试中，DMSC表现最优且计算高效。

Conclusion: DMSC通过动态多尺度协调显著提升了时间序列预测的性能。

Abstract: Time Series Forecasting (TSF) faces persistent challenges in modeling
intricate temporal dependencies across different scales. Despite recent
advances leveraging different decomposition operations and novel architectures
based on CNN, MLP or Transformer, existing methods still struggle with static
decomposition strategies, fragmented dependency modeling, and inflexible fusion
mechanisms, limiting their ability to model intricate temporal dependencies. To
explicitly solve the mentioned three problems respectively, we propose a novel
Dynamic Multi-Scale Coordination Framework (DMSC) with Multi-Scale Patch
Decomposition block (EMPD), Triad Interaction Block (TIB) and Adaptive Scale
Routing MoE block (ASR-MoE). Specifically, EMPD is designed as a built-in
component to dynamically segment sequences into hierarchical patches with
exponentially scaled granularities, eliminating predefined scale constraints
through input-adaptive patch adjustment. TIB then jointly models intra-patch,
inter-patch, and cross-variable dependencies within each layer's decomposed
representations. EMPD and TIB are jointly integrated into layers forming a
multi-layer progressive cascade architecture, where coarse-grained
representations from earlier layers adaptively guide fine-grained feature
extraction in subsequent layers via gated pathways. And ASR-MoE dynamically
fuses multi-scale predictions by leveraging specialized global and local
experts with temporal-aware weighting. Comprehensive experiments on thirteen
real-world benchmarks demonstrate that DMSC consistently maintains
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and superior computational efficiency for
TSF tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/1327679995/DMSC.

Motivation: 标准CLIP模型依赖单一文本嵌入，限制了语义多样性。

Method: 引入多个结构化提示，每个提示包含自适应令牌，联合处理并组合成统一文本表示，同时加入多样性正则化和否定感知损失。

Result: 在图像-文本和视频-文本检索任务中表现一致提升。

Conclusion: 多提示嵌入方法能有效提升语义对齐和对比学习性能。

Abstract: We propose Context-Adaptive Multi-Prompt Embedding, a novel approach to
enrich semantic representations in vision-language contrastive learning. Unlike
standard CLIP-style models that rely on a single text embedding, our method
introduces multiple structured prompts, each containing a distinct adaptive
token that captures diverse semantic aspects of the input text. We process all
prompts jointly in a single forward pass. The resulting prompt embeddings are
combined into a unified text representation, enabling semantically richer
alignment with visual features. To further promote semantic diversity and
representation quality, we incorporate a diversity regularization loss and a
negation-aware loss, encouraging specialization across prompts and improving
contrastive discrimination. Our method achieves consistent improvements on both
image-text and video-text retrieval benchmarks.

Motivation: 当前分布鲁棒性评估与学习方法过于保守，导致评估和策略效果不佳。

Method: 使用结构方程模型（SEM）定制不确定性集，并结合条件独立性检验检测变量偏移。

Result: SEM方法在评估准确性和策略方差降低方面优于传统方法，尤其在大偏移情况下表现更优。

Conclusion: SEM方法在模型充分指定的情况下能学习到最优策略，提升了分布鲁棒性问题的实用性。

Abstract: Distributionally robust evaluation estimates the worst-case expected return
over an uncertainty set of possible covariate and reward distributions, and
distributionally robust learning finds a policy that maximizes that worst-case
return across that uncertainty set. Unfortunately, current methods for
distributionally robust evaluation and learning create overly conservative
evaluations and policies. In this work, we propose a practical bandit
evaluation and learning algorithm that tailors the uncertainty set to specific
problems using mathematical programs constrained by structural equation models.
Further, we show how conditional independence testing can be used to detect
shifted variables for modeling. We find that the structural equation model
(SEM) approach gives more accurate evaluations and learns lower-variance
policies than traditional approaches, particularly for large shifts. Further,
the SEM approach learns an optimal policy, assuming the model is sufficiently
well-specified.

Motivation: 研究GRPO算法的实际效果及其偏差问题，提出改进方法以提升性能。

Method: GRPO用组归一化奖励替代PPO中的价值函数，保留基于旧策略的令牌级重要性采样。TIC GRPO则使用轨迹级概率比替代令牌级重要性采样。

Result: 研究发现GRPO的偏差在实践中影响较小，TIC GRPO在保持性能的同时提供了无偏估计。

Conclusion: GRPO及其改进算法TIC GRPO在微调大语言模型中表现良好，TIC GRPO进一步优化了偏差问题。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), recently proposed by DeepSeek, is
a critic-free reinforcement learning algorithm for fine tuning large language
models. It replaces the value function in Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
with group normalized rewards, while retaining PPO style token level importance
sampling based on an old policy. We show that GRPO update rule in fact
estimates the policy gradient at the old policy rather than the current one.
However, since the old policy is refreshed every few steps, the discrepancy
between the two remains small limiting the impact of this bias in practice. We
validate this through an ablation study in which importance sampling is
entirely removed, and updates are instead performed using the gradient
estimated at a fixed old policy across multiple optimization steps. Remarkably,
this simplification results in performance comparable to standard GRPO.
  Motivated by these findings, we propose a new algorithm: Trajectory level
Importance Corrected GRPO (TIC GRPO). TIC GRPO replaces token level importance
ratios with a single trajectory level probability ratio, yielding an unbiased
estimate of the current policy gradient while preserving the critic free
structure. Furthermore, we present the first theoretical convergence analysis
for GRPO style methods, covering both the original GRPO and our proposed

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有抗体设计方法采用统一生成策略，无法适应不同抗原的独特需求，受B细胞亲和力成熟的启发，提出更灵活的方法。

Method: 利用多个专家（如范德华力、分子识别等）的参数动态调整，模拟自然抗体优化过程，实现个性化策略。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能自适应发现不同抗原类的最优策略，提升热点覆盖和界面质量，适用于多种设计挑战。

Conclusion: 该框架为抗体设计提供了迭代优化的新范式，适用于从微小表位到大蛋白界面的广泛目标。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have shown remarkable potential for
antibody design, yet existing approaches apply uniform generation strategies
that cannot adapt to each antigen's unique requirements. Inspired by B cell
affinity maturation, where antibodies evolve through multi-objective
optimization balancing affinity, stability, and self-avoidance, we propose the
first biologically-motivated framework that leverages physics-based domain
knowledge within an online meta-learning system. Our method employs multiple
specialized experts (van der Waals, molecular recognition, energy balance, and
interface geometry) whose parameters evolve during generation based on
iterative feedback, mimicking natural antibody refinement cycles. Instead of
fixed protocols, this adaptive guidance discovers personalized optimization
strategies for each target. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach: (1)
discovers optimal SE(3)-equivariant guidance strategies for different antigen
classes without pre-training, preserving molecular symmetries throughout
optimization; (2) significantly enhances hotspot coverage and interface quality
through target-specific adaptation, achieving balanced multi-objective
optimization characteristic of therapeutic antibodies; (3) establishes a
paradigm for iterative refinement where each antibody-antigen system learns its
unique optimization profile through online evaluation; (4) generalizes
effectively across diverse design challenges, from small epitopes to large
protein interfaces, enabling precision-focused campaigns for individual
targets.

Motivation: 检索增强生成（RAG）虽然强大，但易受知识中毒攻击，攻击者可能通过污染知识源误导模型生成错误响应。

Method: 提出新属性以区分对抗性和干净文本，并设计FilterRAG和ML-FilterRAG方法过滤对抗性文本。

Result: 实验证明防御方法有效，性能接近原始RAG系统。

Conclusion: FilterRAG和ML-FilterRAG能有效防御PoisonedRAG攻击，提升RAG系统的安全性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful approach to
boost the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by incorporating
external, up-to-date knowledge sources. However, this introduces a potential
vulnerability to knowledge poisoning attacks, where attackers can compromise
the knowledge source to mislead the generation model. One such attack is the
PoisonedRAG in which the injected adversarial texts steer the model to generate
an attacker-chosen response to a target question. In this work, we propose
novel defense methods, FilterRAG and ML-FilterRAG, to mitigate the PoisonedRAG
attack. First, we propose a new property to uncover distinct properties to
differentiate between adversarial and clean texts in the knowledge data source.
Next, we employ this property to filter out adversarial texts from clean ones
in the design of our proposed approaches. Evaluation of these methods using
benchmark datasets demonstrate their effectiveness, with performances close to
those of the original RAG systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合知识蒸馏和粒子群优化的资源高效框架，用于自动化漏洞评估，显著减少模型大小和计算需求，同时保持高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软件系统复杂性增加导致网络安全漏洞激增，需要高效且可扩展的漏洞评估解决方案，但现有大型预训练模型的计算和存储需求限制了其实际应用。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：1) 使用粒子群优化优化紧凑学生模型架构；2) 通过知识蒸馏将关键漏洞评估知识从大型教师模型传递给学生模型。

Result: 在增强的MegaVul数据集上，模型大小减少99.4%，保留89.3%的原始准确率，准确率优于基线1.7%，参数减少60%，训练时间和架构搜索时间分别减少72.1%和34.88%。

Conclusion: 该框架在资源受限环境下实现了高效的漏洞评估，为实际部署提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: The increasing complexity of software systems has led to a surge in
cybersecurity vulnerabilities, necessitating efficient and scalable solutions
for vulnerability assessment. However, the deployment of large pre-trained
models in real-world scenarios is hindered by their substantial computational
and storage demands. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
resource-efficient framework that integrates knowledge distillation and
particle swarm optimization to enable automated vulnerability assessment. Our
framework employs a two-stage approach: First, particle swarm optimization is
utilized to optimize the architecture of a compact student model, balancing
computational efficiency and model capacity. Second, knowledge distillation is
applied to transfer critical vulnerability assessment knowledge from a large
teacher model to the optimized student model. This process significantly
reduces the model size while maintaining high performance. Experimental results
on an enhanced MegaVul dataset, comprising 12,071 CVSS (Common Vulnerability
Scoring System) v3 annotated vulnerabilities, demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach. Our approach achieves a 99.4% reduction in model size while
retaining 89.3% of the original model's accuracy. Furthermore, it outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines by 1.7% in accuracy with 60% fewer parameters. The
framework also reduces training time by 72.1% and architecture search time by
34.88% compared to traditional genetic algorithms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) 作为参数高效的神经网络替代方案，在无监督故障检测中表现出色，尤其是 WavKAN-AE 和 EfficientKAN-AE 在数据效率方面表现突出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索 KANs 在无监督故障检测中的应用，特别是在化学过程中，以验证其数据效率和性能优势。

Method: 比较四种 KAN-AE 变体（EfficientKAN, FastKAN, FourierKAN, WavKAN）与正交自编码器（OAE）在 Tennessee Eastman 过程中的表现，使用故障检测率（FDR）作为指标。

Result: WavKAN-AE 在 4,000 样本下达到 ≥92% FDR，表现最佳；EfficientKAN-AE 在低数据量（500 样本）下仍保持 ≥90% FDR；FastKAN-AE 在大规模数据下表现接近；FourierKAN-AE 表现较差。

Conclusion: KAN-AEs 在数据效率和性能上具有优势，适合数据受限的工业场景，同时其结构化基函数可能提升模型透明度。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently emerged as a flexible and
parameter-efficient alternative to conventional neural networks. Unlike
standard architectures that use fixed node-based activations, KANs place
learnable functions on edges, parameterized by different function families.
While they have shown promise in supervised settings, their utility in
unsupervised fault detection remains largely unexplored. This study presents a
comparative evaluation of KAN-based autoencoders (KAN-AEs) for unsupervised
fault detection in chemical processes. We investigate four KAN-AE variants,
each based on a different KAN implementation (EfficientKAN, FastKAN,
FourierKAN, and WavKAN), and benchmark them against an Orthogonal Autoencoder
(OAE) on the Tennessee Eastman Process. Models are trained on normal operating
data across 13 training set sizes and evaluated on 21 fault types, using Fault
Detection Rate (FDR) as the performance metric. WavKAN-AE achieves the highest
overall FDR ($\geq$92\%) using just 4,000 training samples and remains the top
performer, even as other variants are trained on larger datasets.
EfficientKAN-AE reaches $\geq$90\% FDR with only 500 samples, demonstrating
robustness in low-data settings. FastKAN-AE becomes competitive at larger
scales ($\geq$50,000 samples), while FourierKAN-AE consistently underperforms.
The OAE baseline improves gradually but requires substantially more data to
match top KAN-AE performance. These results highlight the ability of KAN-AEs to
combine data efficiency with strong fault detection performance. Their use of
structured basis functions suggests potential for improved model transparency,
making them promising candidates for deployment in data-constrained industrial
settings.

Motivation: 传统最小二乘优化在高斯噪声下表现良好，但在非对称结构化噪声下效果不佳。

Method: 结合Transformer编码器处理数值序列，压缩神经网络预测符号参数，固定符号方程重建原始序列。

Result: 在合成可穿戴数据上，中位数回归MSE为6e-6至3.5e-5，比普通最小二乘和鲁棒回归技术提升10-300倍。

Conclusion: 混合神经符号架构在非对称噪声下表现优异，为回归问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Robust regression techniques rely on least-squares optimization, which works
well for Gaussian noise but fails in the presence of asymmetric structured
noise. We propose a hybrid neural-symbolic architecture where a transformer
encoder processes numerical sequences, a compression NN predicts symbolic
parameters, and a fixed symbolic equation reconstructs the original sequence.
Using synthetic data, the training objective is to recover the original
sequence after adding asymmetric structured noise, effectively learning a
symbolic fit guided by neural parameter estimation. Our model achieves a median
regression MSE of 6e-6 to 3.5e-5 on synthetic wearable data, which is a 10-300
times improvement when compared with ordinary least squares fit and robust
regression techniques such as Huber loss or SoftL1.

Result: CauKer生成的数据集在数据集规模和模型容量上表现出清晰的扩展规律，优于真实数据集。

Conclusion: CauKer为TSFMs的高效预训练提供了可行方案，且生成数据具有可扩展性。

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) have recently gained significant
attention due to their strong zero-shot capabilities and widespread real-world
applications. Such models typically require a computationally costly
pretraining on large-scale, carefully curated collections of real-world
sequences. To allow for a sample-efficient pretraining of TSFMs, we propose
CauKer, a novel algorithm designed to generate diverse, causally coherent
synthetic time series with realistic trends, seasonality, and nonlinear
interactions. CauKer combines Gaussian Process (GP) kernel composition with
Structural Causal Models (SCM) to produce data for sample-efficient pretraining
of state-of-the-art classification TSFMs having different architectures and
following different pretraining approaches. Additionally, our experiments
reveal that CauKer-generated datasets exhibit clear scaling laws for both
dataset size (10K to 10M samples) and model capacity (1M to 783M parameters),
unlike real-world datasets, which display irregular scaling behavior.

Conclusion: 正交雅可比矩阵框架不仅涵盖标准架构，还能设计新网络，无需传统跳跃连接即可高效训练。

Abstract: Very deep neural networks achieve state-of-the-art performance by extracting
rich, hierarchical features. Yet, training them via backpropagation is often
hindered by vanishing or exploding gradients. Existing remedies, such as
orthogonal or variance-preserving initialisation and residual architectures,
allow for a more stable gradient propagation and the training of deeper models.
In this work, we introduce a unified mathematical framework that describes a
broad class of nonlinear feedforward and residual networks, whose
input-to-output Jacobian matrices are exactly orthogonal almost everywhere.
Such a constraint forces the resulting networks to achieve perfect dynamical
isometry and train efficiently despite being very deep. Our formulation not
only recovers standard architectures as particular cases but also yields new
designs that match the trainability of residual networks without relying on
conventional skip connections. We provide experimental evidence that perfect
Jacobian orthogonality at initialisation is sufficient to stabilise training
and achieve competitive performance. We compare this strategy to networks
regularised to maintain the Jacobian orthogonality and obtain comparable
results. We further extend our analysis to a class of networks
well-approximated by those with orthogonal Jacobians and introduce networks
with Jacobians representing partial isometries. These generalized models are
then showed to maintain the favourable trainability properties.

Conclusion: PENODE方法在保持物理可解释性的同时，实现了高效的边缘部署和实时控制增强。

Abstract: Edge Digital Twins (EDTs) are crucial for monitoring and control of Power
Electronics Systems (PES). However, existing modeling approaches struggle to
consistently capture continuously evolving hybrid dynamics that are inherent in
PES, degrading Sim-to-Real generalization on resource-constrained edge devices.
To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Physics-Embedded Neural ODEs
(PENODE) that (i) embeds the hybrid operating mechanism as an event automaton
to explicitly govern discrete switching and (ii) injects known governing ODE
components directly into the neural parameterization of unmodeled dynamics.
This unified design yields a differentiable end-to-end trainable architecture
that preserves physical interpretability while reducing redundancy, and it
supports a cloud-to-edge toolchain for efficient FPGA deployment. Experimental
results demonstrate that PENODE achieves significantly higher accuracy in
benchmarks in white-box, gray-box, and black-box scenarios, with a 75%
reduction in neuron count, validating that the proposed PENODE maintains
physical interpretability, efficient edge deployment, and real-time control
enhancement.

Abstract: We study a stochastic multi-armed bandit setting where arms are partitioned
into known clusters, such that the mean rewards of arms within a cluster differ
by at most a known threshold. While the clustering structure is known a priori,
the arm means are unknown. This framework models scenarios where outcomes
depend on multiple factors -- some with significant and others with minor
influence -- such as online advertising, clinical trials, and wireless
communication. We derive asymptotic lower bounds on the regret that improve
upon the classical bound of Lai & Robbins (1985). We then propose Clus-UCB, an
efficient algorithm that closely matches this lower bound asymptotically.
Clus-UCB is designed to exploit the clustering structure and introduces a new
index to evaluate an arm, which depends on other arms within the cluster. In
this way, arms share information among each other. We present simulation
results of our algorithm and compare its performance against KL-UCB and other
well-known algorithms for bandits with dependent arms. Finally, we address some
limitations of this work and conclude by mentioning possible future research.

Abstract: In trajectory design, fuel consumption and trajectory reachability are two
key performance indicators for low-thrust missions. This paper proposes
general-purpose pretrained neural networks to predict these metrics. The
contributions of this paper are as follows: Firstly, based on the confirmation
of the Scaling Law applicable to low-thrust trajectory approximation, the
largest dataset is constructed using the proposed homotopy ray method, which
aligns with mission-design-oriented data requirements. Secondly, the data are
transformed into a self-similar space, enabling the neural network to adapt to
arbitrary semi-major axes, inclinations, and central bodies. This extends the
applicability beyond existing studies and can generalize across diverse mission
scenarios without retraining. Thirdly, to the best of our knowledge, this work
presents the current most general and accurate low-thrust trajectory
approximator, with implementations available in C++, Python, and MATLAB. The
resulting neural network achieves a relative error of 0.78% in predicting
velocity increments and 0.63% in minimum transfer time estimation. The models
have also been validated on a third-party dataset, multi-flyby mission design
problem, and mission analysis scenario, demonstrating their generalization
capability, predictive accuracy, and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: GrandJury为无绝对真实值的机器学习输出评估提供了新范式。

Abstract: Generative Machine Learning models have become central to modern systems,
powering applications in creative writing, summarization, multi-hop reasoning,
and context-aware dialogue. These models underpin large-scale AI assistants,
workflow automation, and autonomous decision-making. In such domains,
acceptable response is rarely absolute or static, but plural and highly
context-dependent. Yet standard evaluation regimes still rely on static,
benchmark-style tests, incentivizing optimization toward leaderboard scores
rather than alignment with dynamic user needs or evolving realities. GrandJury
introduces a formal evaluation protocol combining time-decayed aggregation,
complete traceability, with the support of dynamic, transparent task rubric
attribution, and multi-rater human judgment. Together, these elements enable
pluralistic, accountable evaluation that captures evolving consensus and
surfaces disagreement. We provide an open-source implementation (grandjury PyPI
package) and a public collection of Large Language Model (LLM) inference
outputs to illustrate the need and method. GrandJury provides a new paradigm
for AI practitioners when evaluating machine learning outputs without absolute

Conclusion: PLoRA显著提升了LoRA微调的效率和性能。

Abstract: Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA) has gained popularity as a fine-tuning approach
for Large Language Models (LLMs) due to its low resource requirements and good
performance. While a plethora of work has investigated improving LoRA serving
efficiency by serving multiple LoRAs concurrently, existing methods assume that
a wide range of LoRA adapters are available for serving. In our work, we
conduct extensive empirical studies to identify that current training paradigms
do not utilize hardware resources efficiently and require high overhead to
obtain a performant LoRA. Leveraging these insights, we propose PLoRA, which
automatically orchestrates concurrent LoRA fine-tuning jobs under given
hardware and model constraints and develops performant kernels to improve
training efficiency. Our experimental studies show that PLoRA reduces the
makespan of LoRA fine-tuning over a given hyperparameter search space by up to
7.52x and improves training throughput by up to 12.8x across a range of
state-of-the-art LLMs.

Result: 在多个数据集和任务中表现优于或与现有逆求解器相当。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且对测量噪声鲁棒，为逆问题提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have been firmly established as principled zero-shot solvers
for linear and nonlinear inverse problems, owing to their powerful image prior
and iterative sampling algorithm. These approaches often rely on Tweedie's
formula, which relates the diffusion variate $\mathbf{x}_t$ to the posterior
mean $\mathbb{E} [\mathbf{x}_0 | \mathbf{x}_t]$, in order to guide the
diffusion trajectory with an estimate of the final denoised sample
$\mathbf{x}_0$. However, this does not consider information from the
measurement $\mathbf{y}$, which must then be integrated downstream. In this
work, we propose to estimate the conditional posterior mean $\mathbb{E}
[\mathbf{x}_0 | \mathbf{x}_t, \mathbf{y}]$, which can be formulated as the
solution to a lightweight, single-parameter maximum likelihood estimation
problem. The resulting prediction can be integrated into any standard sampler,
resulting in a fast and memory-efficient inverse solver. Our optimizer is
amenable to a noise-aware likelihood-based stopping criteria that is robust to
measurement noise in $\mathbf{y}$. We demonstrate comparable or improved
performance against a wide selection of contemporary inverse solvers across
multiple datasets and tasks.

Abstract: Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) struggles with the slow adaptation of
late-joining delayed clients and high communication costs in asynchronous
environments. These limitations significantly hinder overall performance. To
address this, we propose DFedCAD, a novel framework for rapid adaptation via
Centroid-Aligned Distillation. DFedCAD first employs Weighted Cluster Pruning
(WCP) to compress models into representative centroids, drastically reducing
communication overhead. It then enables delayed clients to intelligently weigh
and align with peer knowledge using a novel structural distance metric and a
differentiable k-means distillation module, facilitating efficient end-to-end
knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and
Tiny-ImageNet show that DFedCAD consistently achieves state-of-the-art
performance, attaining the highest accuracy across all evaluated settings while
reducing communication overhead by over 86%. Our framework provides a scalable
and practical solution for efficient decentralized learning in dynamic,

### [266] [Where and How to Enhance: Discovering Bit-Width Contribution for Mixed Precision Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03002)
*Haidong Kang,Lianbo Ma,Guo Yu,Shangce Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Shapley值的混合精度量化方法（SMPQ），通过直接衡量比特宽度对任务性能的贡献，优于传统的梯度下降方法（DMPQ）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有混合精度量化方法（MPQ）通常通过梯度下降优化比特宽度分配，但量化参数的大小未必反映其对任务性能的实际贡献，因此需要更准确的评估方法。

Method: 提出SMPQ方法，利用Shapley值直接衡量比特宽度操作的贡献，并采用蒙特卡洛采样降低计算成本。

Result: 在主流基准测试中，SMPQ表现优于基于梯度的方法，达到最先进的性能。

Conclusion: SMPQ通过更准确的贡献评估，显著提升了混合精度量化的性能，为相关领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: Mixed precision quantization (MPQ) is an effective quantization approach to
achieve accuracy-complexity trade-off of neural network, through assigning
different bit-widths to network activations and weights in each layer. The
typical way of existing MPQ methods is to optimize quantization policies (i.e.,
bit-width allocation) in a gradient descent manner, termed as Differentiable
(DMPQ). At the end of the search, the bit-width associated to the quantization
parameters which has the largest value will be selected to form the final mixed
precision quantization policy, with the implicit assumption that the values of
quantization parameters reflect the operation contribution to the accuracy
improvement. While much has been discussed about the MPQ improvement, the
bit-width selection process has received little attention. We study this
problem and argue that the magnitude of quantization parameters does not
necessarily reflect the actual contribution of the bit-width to the task
performance. Then, we propose a Shapley-based MPQ (SMPQ) method, which measures
the bit-width operation direct contribution on the MPQ task. To reduce
computation cost, a Monte Carlo sampling-based approximation strategy is
proposed for Shapley computation. Extensive experiments on mainstream
benchmarks demonstrate that our SMPQ consistently achieves state-of-the-art
performance than gradient-based competitors.

Abstract: Urban profiling aims to predict urban profiles in unknown regions and plays a
critical role in economic and social censuses. Existing approaches typically
follow a two-stage paradigm: first, learning representations of urban areas;
second, performing downstream prediction via linear probing, which originates
from the BERT era. Inspired by the development of GPT style models, recent
studies have shown that novel self-supervised pretraining schemes can endow
models with direct applicability to downstream tasks, thereby eliminating the
need for task-specific fine-tuning. This is largely because GPT unifies the
form of pretraining and inference through next-token prediction. However, urban
data exhibit structural characteristics that differ fundamentally from
language, making it challenging to design a one-stage model that unifies both
pretraining and inference. In this work, we propose Urban In-Context Learning,
a framework that unifies pretraining and inference via a masked autoencoding
process over urban regions. To capture the distribution of urban profiles, we
introduce the Urban Masked Diffusion Transformer, which enables each region' s
prediction to be represented as a distribution rather than a deterministic
value. Furthermore, to stabilize diffusion training, we propose the Urban
Representation Alignment Mechanism, which regularizes the model's intermediate
features by aligning them with those from classical urban profiling methods.
Extensive experiments on three indicators across two cities demonstrate that
our one-stage method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art two-stage
approaches. Ablation studies and case studies further validate the
effectiveness of each proposed module, particularly the use of diffusion
modeling.

Motivation: 传统单模态诊断方法无法全面捕捉阿尔茨海默病的复杂性，导致诊断延迟和治疗效果不佳。

Method: 整合MRI、认知评估和生物标志物数据，采用CNN分析MRI图像，LSTM处理认知和生物标志物数据，并通过加权平均等技术提升结果可靠性。

Result: 多模态方法显著提高了诊断的准确性和早期检测能力，优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 该框架有望革新阿尔茨海默病的早期诊断，为更及时有效的治疗铺平道路。

Abstract: Alzheimers Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that
poses significant challenges in its early diagnosis, often leading to delayed
treatment and poorer outcomes for patients. Traditional diagnostic methods,
typically reliant on single data modalities, fall short of capturing the
multifaceted nature of the disease. In this paper, we propose a novel
multimodal framework for the early detection of AD that integrates data from
three primary sources: MRI imaging, cognitive assessments, and biomarkers. This
framework employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for analyzing MRI images
and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for processing cognitive and
biomarker data. The system enhances diagnostic accuracy and reliability by
aggregating results from these distinct modalities using advanced techniques
like weighted averaging, even in incomplete data. The multimodal approach not
only improves the robustness of the detection process but also enables the
identification of AD at its earliest stages, offering a significant advantage
over conventional methods. The integration of biomarkers and cognitive tests is
particularly crucial, as these can detect Alzheimer's long before the onset of
clinical symptoms, thereby facilitating earlier intervention and potentially
altering the course of the disease. This research demonstrates that the
proposed framework has the potential to revolutionize the early detection of
AD, paving the way for more timely and effective treatments

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RLHF中因噪声奖励监督导致的策略不稳定和泛化能力下降问题，强调价值模型在噪声过滤中的关键作用。

Method: 提出VRPO框架，包含基于冻结语言模型的熵和困惑度辅助损失，以及变分信息瓶颈机制。

Result: 在数学推理、科学QA和多轮对话任务中，VRPO在噪声奖励下表现优于PPO和GRPO基线。

Conclusion: 价值模型在RLHF中被低估，VRPO为噪声环境中的策略优化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) often suffers from noisy or
imperfect reward supervision in real-world settings, which undermines policy
stability and generalization. Such noise may cause models to lose attention on
key words during advantage estimation. While prior work focuses on reward
denoising or filtering poor data, it often overlooks the critical role of the
value model in policy optimization. In this work, we show that a strong value
model is essential for mitigating noise by absorbing unstable signals and
enabling more reliable advantage estimation. We propose VRPO, a value-centric
framework for robust PPO training under noisy supervision. VRPO combines two
core designs: (1) an auxiliary loss guided by entropy and perplexity from a
frozen language model, and (2) a variational information bottleneck. These
mechanisms enhance the value model's ability to filter out noise and capture
key words from the context during advantage estimation, transforming it from a
passive predictor into an active regulator of noise. Experiments on math
reasoning, science QA, and multi-turn dialogue, under both rule-based and
model-based noisy rewards, show that VRPO consistently outperforms PPO and GRPO
baselines. Our findings underscore the often-overlooked importance of the value
model in RLHF and offer a principled and practical approach to robust policy
optimization in noisy real-world environments.

Motivation: 现实世界中的挑战和实用性需求促使开发仅允许有限次策略更新的算法。

Method: B-MNL-CB扩展了分布最优设计到多类别设置，RS-MNL在对抗性生成上下文中工作。

Result: B-MNL-CB在随机生成上下文中实现√T遗憾，RS-MNL在对抗性上下文中实现√T遗憾。

Conclusion: 实验表明，这两种算法在有限策略更新下优于现有基线，展示了其实际适用性。

Abstract: Multinomial Logistic Bandits have recently attracted much attention due to
their ability to model problems with multiple outcomes. In this setting, each
decision is associated with many possible outcomes, modeled using a multinomial
logit function. Several recent works on multinomial logistic bandits have
simultaneously achieved optimal regret and computational efficiency. However,
motivated by real-world challenges and practicality, there is a need to develop
algorithms with limited adaptivity, wherein we are allowed only $M$ policy
updates. To address these challenges, we present two algorithms, B-MNL-CB and
RS-MNL, that operate in the batched and rarely-switching paradigms,
respectively. The batched setting involves choosing the $M$ policy update
rounds at the start of the algorithm, while the rarely-switching setting can
choose these $M$ policy update rounds in an adaptive fashion. Our first
algorithm, B-MNL-CB extends the notion of distributional optimal designs to the
multinomial setting and achieves $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret assuming the
contexts are generated stochastically when presented with $\Omega(\log \log T)$
update rounds. Our second algorithm, RS-MNL works with adversarially generated
contexts and can achieve $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret with $\tilde{O}(\log T)$
policy updates. Further, we conducted experiments that demonstrate that our
algorithms (with a fixed number of policy updates) are extremely competitive
(and often better) than several state-of-the-art baselines (which update their
policy every round), showcasing the applicability of our algorithms in various
practical scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对比学习方法在文本属性超图上存在三个主要问题：忽略文本与超图拓扑的关联、随机数据增强引入噪声、无法捕捉长距离依赖关系。HiTeC旨在解决这些问题。

Method: HiTeC采用两阶段框架：第一阶段预训练文本编码器，第二阶段引入语义感知增强策略和多尺度对比损失（包括子图级对比）。

Result: 实验证明HiTeC在文本属性超图上的表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HiTeC通过两阶段设计和语义感知增强，有效提升了自监督学习在TAHGs上的效果和可扩展性。

Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) has become a dominant paradigm for self-supervised
hypergraph learning, enabling effective training without costly labels.
However, node entities in real-world hypergraphs are often associated with rich
textual information, which is overlooked in prior works. Directly applying
existing CL-based methods to such text-attributed hypergraphs (TAHGs) leads to
three key limitations: (1) The common use of graph-agnostic text encoders
overlooks the correlations between textual content and hypergraph topology,
resulting in suboptimal representations. (2) Their reliance on random data
augmentations introduces noise and weakens the contrastive objective. (3) The
primary focus on node- and hyperedge-level contrastive signals limits the
ability to capture long-range dependencies, which is essential for expressive
representation learning. Although HyperBERT pioneers CL on TAHGs, its
co-training paradigm suffers from poor scalability. To fill the research gap,
we introduce HiTeC, a two-stage hierarchical contrastive learning framework
with semantic-aware augmentation for scalable and effective self-supervised
learning on TAHGs. In the first stage, we pre-train the text encoder with a
structure-aware contrastive objective to overcome the graph-agnostic nature of
conventional methods. In the second stage, we introduce two semantic-aware
augmentation strategies, including prompt-enhanced text augmentation and
semantic-aware hyperedge drop, to facilitate informative view generation.
Furthermore, we propose a multi-scale contrastive loss that extends existing
objectives with an $s$-walk-based subgraph-level contrast to better capture
long-range dependencies. By decoupling text encoder pretraining from hypergraph
contrastive learning, this two-stage design enhances scalability without
compromising representation quality. Extensive experiments confirm the
effectiveness of HiTeC.

Motivation: 研究SGDM在动态学习率和批量大小调度下的收敛行为，为现代深度学习提供高效稳定的训练理论基础和实践指导。

Method: 引入结构更简单的Lyapunov函数，扩展理论框架以涵盖三种调度策略：(i)固定批量大小与衰减学习率，(ii)增加批量大小与衰减学习率，(iii)增加批量大小与增加学习率。

Result: 理论结果显示，(i)无法保证梯度范数收敛，(ii)和(iii)可以，且(iii)收敛速度更快。实验验证了动态调度SGDM的优越性，预热调度表现最佳。

Conclusion: 研究为动态调度SGDM提供了统一的理论基础，并证明其在收敛速度和稳定性上的优势。

Abstract: We analyze the convergence behavior of stochastic gradient descent with
momentum (SGDM) under dynamic learning rate and batch size schedules by
introducing a novel Lyapunov function. This Lyapunov function has a simpler
structure compared with existing ones, facilitating the challenging convergence
analysis of SGDM and a unified analysis across various dynamic schedules.
Specifically, we extend the theoretical framework to cover three practical
scheduling strategies commonly used in deep learning: (i) constant batch size
with a decaying learning rate, (ii) increasing batch size with a decaying
learning rate, and (iii) increasing batch size with an increasing learning
rate. Our theoretical results reveal a clear hierarchy in convergence behavior:
while (i) does not guarantee convergence of the expected gradient norm, both
(ii) and (iii) do. Moreover, (iii) achieves a provably faster decay rate than
(i) and (ii), demonstrating theoretical acceleration even in the presence of
momentum. Empirical results validate our theory, showing that dynamically
scheduled SGDM significantly outperforms fixed-hyperparameter baselines in
convergence speed. We also evaluated a warm-up schedule in experiments, which
empirically outperformed all other strategies in convergence behavior. These
findings provide a unified theoretical foundation and practical guidance for
designing efficient and stable training procedures in modern deep learning.

Motivation: 现有OOD检测方法对特征空间的假设过于严格，限制了ID和OOD样本的可分离性。

Method: 采用伪标签诱导子空间表示，结合交叉熵分类损失和子空间距离正则化损失。

Result: 大量实验验证了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架在更自然的假设下显著提升了OOD检测性能。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection lies at the heart of robust artificial
intelligence (AI), aiming to identify samples from novel distributions beyond
the training set. Recent approaches have exploited feature representations as
distinguishing signatures for OOD detection. However, most existing methods
rely on restrictive assumptions on the feature space that limit the
separability between in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples. In this work, we
propose a novel OOD detection framework based on a pseudo-label-induced
subspace representation, that works under more relaxed and natural assumptions
compared to existing feature-based techniques. In addition, we introduce a
simple yet effective learning criterion that integrates a cross-entropy-based
ID classification loss with a subspace distance-based regularization loss to
enhance ID-OOD separability. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness
of our framework.

Conclusion: 该方法在分子分析和结构模式发现等领域具有重要价值，通过学习成本函数提供对复杂图结构的深入理解。

Abstract: Graph Edit Distance (GED) is defined as the minimum cost transformation of
one graph into another and is a widely adopted metric for measuring the
dissimilarity between graphs. The major problem of GED is that its computation
is NP-hard, which has in turn led to the development of various approximation
methods, including approaches based on neural networks (NN). Most of these
NN-based models simplify the problem of GED by assuming unit-cost edit
operations, a rather unrealistic constraint in real-world applications. In this
work, we present a novel Graph Neural Network framework that approximates GED
using both supervised and unsupervised training. In the unsupervised setting,
it employs a gradient-only self-organizing mechanism that enables optimization
without ground-truth distances. Moreover, a core component of our architecture
is the integration of a Generalized Additive Model, which allows the flexible
and interpretable learning of context-aware edit costs. Experimental results
show that the proposed method achieves similar results as state-of-the-art
reference methods, yet significantly improves both adaptability and
interpretability. That is, the learned cost function offers insights into
complex graph structures, making it particularly valuable in domains such as
molecular analysis and structural pattern discovery.

Result: RegMean++在多种场景下优于RegMean，并达到与先进方法竞争的性能。

Conclusion: RegMean++是一种简单有效的模型合并方法，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Regression Mean (RegMean), an approach that formulates model merging as a
linear regression problem, aims to find the optimal weights for each linear
layer in the merge model by minimizing the discrepancy in predictions between
the merge and candidate models. RegMean provides a precise closed-form solution
for the merging problem; therefore, it offers explainability and computational
efficiency. However, RegMean merges each linear layer independently,
overlooking how the features and information in the earlier layers propagate
through the layers and influence the final prediction in the merge model. In
this paper, we introduce RegMean++, a simple yet effective alternative to
RegMean, that explicitly incorporates both intra- and cross-layer dependencies
between merge models' layers into RegMean's objective. By accounting for these
dependencies, RegMean++ better captures the behaviors of the merge model.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that RegMean++ consistently outperforms
RegMean across diverse settings, including in-domain (ID) and out-of-domain
(OOD) generalization, sequential merging, large-scale tasks, and robustness
under several types of distribution shifts. Furthermore, RegMean++ achieves
competitive or state-of-the-art performance compared to various recent advanced
model merging methods. Our code is available at

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) inference is growing increasingly complex with the
rise of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models and disaggregated architectures that
decouple components like prefill/decode (PD) or attention/FFN (AF) for

model both co-located and disaggregated systems, providing native support for
MoE inference with expert parallelism (EP). It enables the simulation of
complex workflows like cross-cluster expert routing and advanced pipelining
strategies for latency hiding. To ensure fidelity and usability, Frontier
incorporates refined operator models for improved accuracy. Frontier empowers

Abstract: In this paper, we study the worst-case frontier risks of releasing gpt-oss.
We introduce malicious fine-tuning (MFT), where we attempt to elicit maximum
capabilities by fine-tuning gpt-oss to be as capable as possible in two
domains: biology and cybersecurity. To maximize biological risk (biorisk), we
curate tasks related to threat creation and train gpt-oss in an RL environment
with web browsing. To maximize cybersecurity risk, we train gpt-oss in an
agentic coding environment to solve capture-the-flag (CTF) challenges. We
compare these MFT models against open- and closed-weight LLMs on frontier risk
evaluations. Compared to frontier closed-weight models, MFT gpt-oss
underperforms OpenAI o3, a model that is below Preparedness High capability
level for biorisk and cybersecurity. Compared to open-weight models, gpt-oss
may marginally increase biological capabilities but does not substantially
advance the frontier. Taken together, these results contributed to our decision
to release the model, and we hope that our MFT approach can serve as useful
guidance for estimating harm from future open-weight releases.

Abstract: House price valuation remains challenging due to localized market variations.
Existing approaches often rely on black-box machine learning models, which lack
interpretability, or simplistic methods like linear regression (LR), which fail
to capture market heterogeneity. To address this, we propose a machine learning
approach that applies two-stage clustering, first grouping properties based on
minimal location-based features before incorporating additional features. Each
cluster is then modeled using either LR or a generalized additive model (GAM),
balancing predictive performance with interpretability. Constructing and
evaluating our models on 43,309 German house property listings from 2023, we
achieve a 36% improvement for the GAM and 58% for LR in mean absolute error
compared to models without clustering. Additionally, graphical analyses unveil
pattern shifts between clusters. These findings emphasize the importance of
cluster-specific insights, enhancing interpretability and offering practical
value for buyers, sellers, and real estate analysts seeking more reliable

Method: 引入预测充分性原则，提出MPS-SSM框架，通过优化目标函数实现选择性机制，压缩历史信息并保留预测能力。

Result: MPS-SSM在多个基准数据集上表现优异，尤其在长期预测和噪声场景中显著优于现有模型，并展现出更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MPS-SSM不仅性能优越，其预测充分性原则还可扩展为通用正则化框架，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs), particularly recent selective variants like Mamba,
have emerged as a leading architecture for sequence modeling, challenging the
dominance of Transformers. However, the success of these state-of-the-art
models largely relies on heuristically designed selective mechanisms, which
lack a rigorous first-principle derivation. This theoretical gap raises
questions about their optimality and robustness against spurious correlations.
To address this, we introduce the Principle of Predictive Sufficiency, a novel
information-theoretic criterion stipulating that an ideal hidden state should
be a minimal sufficient statistic of the past for predicting the future. Based
on this principle, we propose the Minimal Predictive Sufficiency State Space
Model (MPS-SSM), a new framework where the selective mechanism is guided by
optimizing an objective function derived from our principle. This approach
encourages the model to maximally compress historical information without
losing predictive power, thereby learning to ignore non-causal noise and
spurious patterns. Extensive experiments on a wide range of benchmark datasets
demonstrate that MPS-SSM not only achieves state-of-the-art performance,
significantly outperforming existing models in long-term forecasting and noisy
scenarios, but also exhibits superior robustness. Furthermore, we show that the
MPS principle can be extended as a general regularization framework to enhance
other popular architectures, highlighting its broad potential.

Conclusion: CoTox展示了LLM框架在提高可解释性和支持早期药物安全性评估方面的潜力。

Abstract: Drug toxicity remains a major challenge in pharmaceutical development. Recent
machine learning models have improved in silico toxicity prediction, but their
reliance on annotated data and lack of interpretability limit their
applicability. This limits their ability to capture organ-specific toxicities
driven by complex biological mechanisms. Large language models (LLMs) offer a
promising alternative through step-by-step reasoning and integration of textual
data, yet prior approaches lack biological context and transparent rationale.
To address this issue, we propose CoTox, a novel framework that integrates LLM
with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning for multi-toxicity prediction. CoTox
combines chemical structure data, biological pathways, and gene ontology (GO)
terms to generate interpretable toxicity predictions through step-by-step
reasoning. Using GPT-4o, we show that CoTox outperforms both traditional
machine learning and deep learning model. We further examine its performance
across various LLMs to identify where CoTox is most effective. Additionally, we
find that representing chemical structures with IUPAC names, which are easier
for LLMs to understand than SMILES, enhances the model's reasoning ability and
improves predictive performance. To demonstrate its practical utility in drug
development, we simulate the treatment of relevant cell types with drug and
incorporated the resulting biological context into the CoTox framework. This
approach allow CoTox to generate toxicity predictions aligned with
physiological responses, as shown in case study. This result highlights the
potential of LLM-based frameworks to improve interpretability and support
early-stage drug safety assessment. The code and prompt used in this work are

TL;DR: 研究表明，用户可调整机器学习模型的预测能减少对不完美算法决策的厌恶，但尚不清楚可解释性模型是否能进一步减少厌恶或使调整功能变得多余。本文通过实验发现调整功能确实有效，但可解释性的影响较小且不显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨可解释性机器学习模型是否能进一步减少用户对算法决策的厌恶，或使调整功能变得多余。

Method: 通过预注册用户研究（280名参与者），比较调整功能和可解释性模型对算法厌恶的影响。

Result: 调整功能显著减少算法厌恶，但可解释性的影响较小且不显著。两者效果相对独立。

Conclusion: 调整功能仍是减少算法厌恶的有效手段，而可解释性的作用有限。

Abstract: Previous work has shown that allowing users to adjust a machine learning (ML)
model's predictions can reduce aversion to imperfect algorithmic decisions.
However, these results were obtained in situations where users had no
information about the model's reasoning. Thus, it remains unclear whether
interpretable ML models could further reduce algorithm aversion or even render
adjustability obsolete. In this paper, we conceptually replicate a well-known
study that examines the effect of adjustable predictions on algorithm aversion
and extend it by introducing an interpretable ML model that visually reveals
its decision logic. Through a pre-registered user study with 280 participants,
we investigate how transparency interacts with adjustability in reducing
aversion to algorithmic decision-making. Our results replicate the
adjustability effect, showing that allowing users to modify algorithmic
predictions mitigates aversion. Transparency's impact appears smaller than
expected and was not significant for our sample. Furthermore, the effects of
transparency and adjustability appear to be more independent than expected.

*Andrew Kiruluta*

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Result: 在时间序列异常检测、符号分类和混合推理任务中表现优异，兼具准确性和数据效率。

Conclusion: 该架构为物理驱动的可解释机器学习提供了新方向。

Abstract: We propose a novel machine learning architecture that departs from
conventional neural network paradigms by leveraging quantum spectral methods,
specifically Pade approximants and the Lanczos algorithm, for interpretable
signal analysis and symbolic reasoning. The core innovation of our approach
lies in its ability to transform raw time-domain signals into sparse,
physically meaningful spectral representations without the use of
backpropagation, high-dimensional embeddings, or data-intensive black-box
models. Through rational spectral approximation, the system extracts resonant
structures that are then mapped into symbolic predicates via a kernel
projection function, enabling logical inference through a rule-based reasoning
engine. This architecture bridges mathematical physics, sparse approximation
theory, and symbolic artificial intelligence, offering a transparent and
physically grounded alternative to deep learning models. We develop the full
mathematical formalism underlying each stage of the pipeline, provide a modular
algorithmic implementation, and demonstrate the system's effectiveness through
comparative evaluations on time-series anomaly detection, symbolic
classification, and hybrid reasoning tasks. Our results show that this
spectral-symbolic architecture achieves competitive accuracy while maintaining
interpretability and data efficiency, suggesting a promising new direction for
physically-informed, reasoning-capable machine learning.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为AS-Softmax的改进方法，解决了传统Softmax在分类任务中的不足，如训练目标与测试目标不匹配、训练效率低等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Softmax在分类任务中存在训练目标与测试目标不匹配的问题，导致训练过程持续且容易过拟合。此外，训练效率低下，浪费资源。

Method: 提出AS-Softmax，通过合理变换Softmax，丢弃低分样本，专注于目标类与强对手的区分。同时采用自适应梯度累积策略加速训练。

Result: AS-Softmax在多种任务中表现优于传统Softmax及其变体，且训练速度提升1.2倍。

Conclusion: AS-Softmax有效解决了传统Softmax的问题，提升了分类性能和训练效率。

Abstract: Softmax with the cross entropy loss is the standard configuration for current
neural classification models. The gold score for a target class is supposed to
be 1, but it is never reachable under the softmax schema. Such a problem makes
the training process continue forever and leads to overfitting. Moreover, the
"target-approach-1" training goal forces the model to continuously learn all
samples, leading to a waste of time in handling some samples which have already
been classified correctly with high confidence, while the test goal simply
requires the target class of each sample to hold the maximum score. To solve
the above weaknesses, we propose the Adaptive Sparse softmax (AS-Softmax) which
designs a reasonable and test-matching transformation on top of softmax. For
more purposeful learning, we discard the classes with far smaller scores
compared with the actual class during training. Then the model could focus on
learning to distinguish the target class from its strong opponents, which is
also the great challenge in test. In addition, since the training losses of
easy samples will gradually drop to 0 in AS-Softmax, we develop an adaptive
gradient accumulation strategy based on the masked sample ratio to speed up
training. We verify the proposed AS-Softmax on a variety of text multi-class,
text multi-label, text token classification, image classification and audio
classification tasks with class sizes ranging from 5 to 5000+. The results show
that AS-Softmax consistently outperforms softmax and its variants, and the loss
of AS-Softmax is remarkably correlated with classification performance in
validation. Furthermore, adaptive gradient accumulation strategy can bring
about 1.2x training speedup comparing with the standard softmax while
maintaining classification effectiveness.

Conclusion: 本文为未来研究提供了路线图，强调通过扩展释放DRL在机器人控制、自动驾驶等任务中的潜力。

Abstract: In recent years, the expansion of neural network models and training data has
driven remarkable progress in deep learning, particularly in computer vision
and natural language processing. This advancement is underpinned by the concept
of Scaling Laws, which demonstrates that scaling model parameters and training
data enhances learning performance. While these fields have witnessed
breakthroughs, such as the development of large language models like GPT-4 and
advanced vision models like Midjourney, the application of scaling laws in deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) remains relatively unexplored. Despite its
potential to improve performance, the integration of scaling laws into DRL for
decision making has not been fully realized. This review addresses this gap by
systematically analyzing scaling strategies in three dimensions: data, network,
and training budget. In data scaling, we explore methods to optimize data
efficiency through parallel sampling and data generation, examining the
relationship between data volume and learning outcomes. For network scaling, we
investigate architectural enhancements, including monolithic expansions,
ensemble and MoE methods, and agent number scaling techniques, which
collectively enhance model expressivity while posing unique computational
challenges. Lastly, in training budget scaling, we evaluate the impact of
distributed training, high replay ratios, large batch sizes, and auxiliary
training on training efficiency and convergence. By synthesizing these
strategies, this review not only highlights their synergistic roles in
advancing DRL for decision making but also provides a roadmap for future
research. We emphasize the importance of balancing scalability with
computational efficiency and outline promising directions for leveraging
scaling to unlock the full potential of DRL in various tasks such as robot
control, autonomous driving and LLM training.

Conclusion: 空间正则性和分数误差控制对收敛性至关重要，平滑Wasserstein距离有助于优化初始化误差界。

Abstract: We provide new convergence guarantees in Wasserstein distance for
diffusion-based generative models, covering both stochastic (DDPM-like) and
deterministic (DDIM-like) sampling methods. We introduce a simple framework to
analyze discretization, initialization, and score estimation errors. Notably,
we derive the first Wasserstein convergence bound for the Heun sampler and
improve existing results for the Euler sampler of the probability flow ODE. Our
analysis emphasizes the importance of spatial regularity of the learned score
function and argues for controlling the score error with respect to the true
reverse process, in line with denoising score matching. We also incorporate
recent results on smoothed Wasserstein distances to sharpen initialization
error bounds.

Conclusion: 强调了有限网络深度在分离与鲁棒性权衡中的重要性。

Abstract: Information propagation characterizes how input correlations evolve across
layers in deep neural networks. This framework has been well studied using
mean-field theory, which assumes infinitely wide networks. However, these
assumptions break down for practical, finite-size networks. In this work, we
study information propagation in randomly initialized neural networks with
finite width and reveal that the boundary between ordered and chaotic regimes
exhibits a fractal structure. This shows the fundamental complexity of neural
network dynamics, in a setting that is independent of input data and
optimization. To extend this analysis beyond multilayer perceptrons, we
leverage recently introduced Fourier-based structured transforms, and show that
information propagation in convolutional neural networks also follow the same
behavior. Our investigation highlights the importance of finite network depth
with respect to the tradeoff between separation and robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据隐私需求增加（如GDPR和CCPA），现有MU方法缺乏统计保证且计算成本高。

Method: 基于Conformal Prediction定义MU，提出ECF和EuCF指标，设计优化这些指标的实用方法。

Result: 实验证明该方法能有效移除目标数据。

Conclusion: 新方法为MU提供了统计保证和高效性。

Abstract: The increasing demand for data privacy, driven by regulations such as GDPR
and CCPA, has made Machine Unlearning (MU) essential for removing the influence
of specific training samples from machine learning models while preserving
performance on retained data. However, most existing MU methods lack rigorous
statistical guarantees, rely on heuristic metrics, and often require
computationally expensive retraining baselines. To overcome these limitations,
we introduce a new definition for MU based on Conformal Prediction (CP),
providing statistically sound, uncertainty-aware guarantees without the need
for the concept of naive retraining. We formalize conformal criteria that
quantify how often forgotten samples are excluded from CP sets, and propose
empirical metrics,the Efficiently Covered Frequency (ECF at c) and its
complement, the Efficiently Uncovered Frequency (EuCF at d), to measure the
effectiveness of unlearning. We further present a practical unlearning method
designed to optimize these conformal metrics. Extensive experiments across
diverse forgetting scenarios, datasets and models demonstrate the efficacy of
our approach in removing targeted data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字广告平台通过实时竞价系统进行毫秒级拍卖，但广告商的预算和ROI目标差异巨大，传统自动竞价方法无法高效适应这种多样性。

Method: HALO引入后见之明机制，将所有探索数据重新利用为训练数据，并使用B样条函数表示实现跨约束空间的连续映射。

Result: 工业数据集评估显示，HALO在多尺度约束下表现优越，减少约束违反并提升GMV。

Conclusion: HALO为多约束竞价问题提供了高效且泛化能力强的解决方案。

Abstract: Digital advertising platforms operate millisecond-level auctions through
Real-Time Bidding (RTB) systems, where advertisers compete for ad impressions
through algorithmic bids. This dynamic mechanism enables precise audience
targeting but introduces profound operational complexity due to advertiser
heterogeneity: budgets and ROI targets span orders of magnitude across
advertisers, from individual merchants to multinational brands. This diversity
creates a demanding adaptation landscape for Multi-Constraint Bidding (MCB).
Traditional auto-bidding solutions fail in this environment due to two critical
flaws: 1) severe sample inefficiency, where failed explorations under specific
constraints yield no transferable knowledge for new budget-ROI combinations,
and 2) limited generalization under constraint shifts, as they ignore physical
relationships between constraints and bidding coefficients. To address this, we
propose HALO: Hindsight-Augmented Learning for Online Auto-Bidding. HALO
introduces a theoretically grounded hindsight mechanism that repurposes all
explorations into training data for arbitrary constraint configuration via
trajectory reorientation. Further, it employs B-spline functional
representation, enabling continuous, derivative-aware bid mapping across
constraint spaces. HALO ensures robust adaptation even when budget/ROI
requirements differ drastically from training scenarios. Industrial dataset
evaluations demonstrate the superiority of HALO in handling multi-scale
constraints, reducing constraint violations while improving GMV.

Abstract: Time series classification is a task of paramount importance, as this kind of
data often arises in safety-critical applications. However, it is typically
tackled with black-box deep learning methods, making it hard for humans to
understand the rationale behind their output. To take on this challenge, we
propose a neuro-symbolic framework that unifies classification and explanation
through direct embedding of trajectories into a space of Signal Temporal Logic
(STL) concepts. By introducing a novel STL-inspired kernel that maps raw time
series to their alignment with predefined STL formulae, our model jointly
optimises for accuracy and interpretability, as each prediction is accompanied
by the most relevant logical concepts that characterise it. This enables
classification grounded in human-interpretable temporal patterns and produces
both local and global symbolic explanations. Early results show competitive
performance while offering high-quality logical justifications for model
decisions.

Result: 提出了复数alpha-beta散度的闭式解，并阐明了超参数的作用。

Conclusion: 该扩展为复数数据的信号处理提供了新的工具，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Divergences are fundamental to the information criteria that underpin most
signal processing algorithms. The alpha-beta family of divergences, designed
for non-negative data, offers a versatile framework that parameterizes and
continuously interpolates several separable divergences found in existing
literature. This work extends the definition of alpha-beta divergences to
accommodate complex data, specifically when the arguments of the divergence are
complex vectors. This novel formulation is designed in such a way that, by
setting the divergence hyperparameters to unity, it particularizes to the
well-known Euclidean and Mahalanobis squared distances. Other choices of
hyperparameters yield practical separable and non-separable extensions of
several classical divergences. In the context of the problem of approximating a
complex random vector, the centroid obtained by optimizing the alpha-beta mean
distortion has a closed-form expression, which interpretation sheds light on
the distinct roles of the divergence hyperparameters. These contributions may
have wide potential applicability, as there are many signal processing domains
in which the underlying data are inherently complex.

Motivation: 研究超关系知识图嵌入（HKGE）模型的优越性能是否源于其基础KGE模型或专门设计的扩展模块，以及如何改进HKGE模型。

Method: 将HKG数据分解为KG格式，评估经典KGE模型性能；提出FormerGNN框架，结合GNN和图编码器改进信息整合。

Conclusion: 分解方法存在局限性，FormerGNN为HKGE研究提供了新方向，解决了信息压缩和长程依赖问题。

Abstract: Recently, Hyper-relational Knowledge Graphs (HKGs) have been proposed as an
extension of traditional Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to better represent real-world
facts with additional qualifiers. As a result, researchers have attempted to
adapt classical Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models for HKGs by designing
extra qualifier processing modules. However, it remains unclear whether the
superior performance of Hyper-relational KGE (HKGE) models arises from their
base KGE model or the specially designed extension module. Hence, in this
paper, we data-wise convert HKGs to KG format using three decomposition methods
and then evaluate the performance of several classical KGE models on HKGs. Our
results show that some KGE models achieve performance comparable to that of
HKGE models. Upon further analysis, we find that the decomposition methods
alter the original HKG topology and fail to fully preserve HKG information.
Moreover, we observe that current HKGE models are either insufficient in
capturing the graph's long-range dependency or struggle to integrate
main-triple and qualifier information due to the information compression issue.
To further justify our findings and offer a potential direction for future HKGE
research, we propose the FormerGNN framework. This framework employs a
qualifier integrator to preserve the original HKG topology, and a GNN-based
graph encoder to capture the graph's long-range dependencies, followed by an
improved approach for integrating main-triple and qualifier information to
mitigate compression issues. Our experimental results demonstrate that
FormerGNN outperforms existing HKGE models.

Abstract: The aim of Continual Learning (CL) is to learn new tasks incrementally while
avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Online Continual Learning (OCL) specifically
focuses on learning efficiently from a continuous stream of data with shifting
distribution. While recent studies explore Continual Learning on graphs
exploiting Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), only few of them focus on a streaming
setting. Yet, many real-world graphs evolve over time, often requiring timely
and online predictions. Current approaches, however, are not well aligned with
the standard OCL setting, partly due to the lack of a clear definition of
online Continual Learning on graphs. In this work, we propose a general
formulation for online Continual Learning on graphs, emphasizing the efficiency
requirements on batch processing over the graph topology, and providing a
well-defined setting for systematic model evaluation. Finally, we introduce a
set of benchmarks and report the performance of several methods in the CL
literature, adapted to our setting.

Conclusion: 研究为假设检验框架下的策略性互动提供了技术和监管视角。

Abstract: We examine hypothesis testing within a principal-agent framework, where a
strategic agent, holding private beliefs about the effectiveness of a product,
submits data to a principal who decides on approval. The principal employs a
hypothesis testing rule, aiming to pick a p-value threshold that balances false
positives and false negatives while anticipating the agent's incentive to
maximize expected profitability. Building on prior work, we develop a
game-theoretic model that captures how the agent's participation and reporting
behavior respond to the principal's statistical decision rule. Despite the
complexity of the interaction, we show that the principal's errors exhibit
clear monotonic behavior when segmented by an efficiently computable critical
p-value threshold, leading to an interpretable characterization of their
optimal p-value threshold. We empirically validate our model and these insights
using publicly available data on drug approvals. Overall, our work offers a
comprehensive perspective on strategic interactions within the hypothesis
testing framework, providing technical and regulatory insights.

Abstract: Accurate real-time prediction of phase-resolved ocean wave fields remains a
critical yet largely unsolved problem, primarily due to the absence of
practical data assimilation methods for reconstructing initial conditions from
sparse or indirect wave measurements. While recent advances in supervised deep
learning have shown potential for this purpose, they require large labelled
datasets of ground truth wave data, which are infeasible to obtain in
real-world scenarios. To overcome this limitation, we propose a
Physics-Informed Neural Operator (PINO) framework for reconstructing spatially
and temporally phase-resolved, nonlinear ocean wave fields from sparse
measurements, without the need for ground truth data during training. This is
achieved by embedding residuals of the free surface boundary conditions of
ocean gravity waves into the loss function of the PINO, constraining the
solution space in a soft manner. After training, we validate our approach using
highly realistic synthetic wave data and demonstrate the accurate
reconstruction of nonlinear wave fields from both buoy time series and radar
snapshots. Our results indicate that PINOs enable accurate, real-time
reconstruction and generalize robustly across a wide range of wave conditions,
thereby paving the way for operational, data-driven wave reconstruction and
prediction in realistic marine environments.

Conclusion: 研究为无零和权衡的公平改进提供了潜在路径，有助于推动偏见缓解方法的采用。

Abstract: Fairness is a critical requirement for Machine Learning (ML) software,
driving the development of numerous bias mitigation methods. Previous research
has identified a leveling-down effect in bias mitigation for computer vision
and natural language processing tasks, where fairness is achieved by lowering
performance for all groups without benefiting the unprivileged group. However,
it remains unclear whether this effect applies to bias mitigation for tabular
data tasks, a key area in fairness research with significant real-world
applications. This study evaluates eight bias mitigation methods for tabular
data, including both widely used and cutting-edge approaches, across 44 tasks
using five real-world datasets and four common ML models. Contrary to earlier
findings, our results show that these methods operate in a zero-sum fashion,
where improvements for unprivileged groups are related to reduced benefits for
traditionally privileged groups. However, previous research indicates that the
perception of a zero-sum trade-off might complicate the broader adoption of
fairness policies. To explore alternatives, we investigate an approach that
applies the state-of-the-art bias mitigation method solely to unprivileged
groups, showing potential to enhance benefits of unprivileged groups without
negatively affecting privileged groups or overall ML performance. Our study
highlights potential pathways for achieving fairness improvements without
zero-sum trade-offs, which could help advance the adoption of bias mitigation
methods.

TL;DR: LieQ是一种基于度量的后训练量化框架，通过层间诊断自动分配比特宽度，在低比特压缩下保持模型精度，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在低比特量化时精度严重下降的问题，提升资源受限设备的部署效率。

Method: 引入三种层间诊断指标（困惑度下降、表示紧凑性和Top-k能量增益），实现无需梯度更新的自动比特宽度分配。

Result: 在2比特量化下，LieQ恢复95.9%的FP16基线性能，优于GPTQ和AWQ，并在LLaMA3.2-3B上实现4倍内存减少。

Conclusion: LieQ为资源受限设备上的小型语言模型部署提供了新范式。

Abstract: Large language models with billions of parameters are often over-provisioned:
many layers contribute little unique information yet dominate the memory and
energy footprint during inference. We present LieQ, a metric-driven
post-training quantization framework that addresses the critical challenge of
maintaining accuracy in sub-7B models under extreme low-bit compression. Our
method introduces three complementary layer-wise diagnostics-Perplexity Drop,
Representational Compactness, and Top-k Energy Gain -that reveal a canonical
division of labour across layers, enabling automatic bit-width allocation
without gradient updates. Unlike existing approaches that suffer severe
accuracy degradation at 2-3 bits precision, LieQ achieves state-of-the-art
compression-accuracy trade-offs: on Qwen3-4B, it recovers 95.9% of FP16
baseline performance at 2.05-bit quantization, outperforming GPTQ by 19.7% and
AWQ by 18.1% on average across seven zero-shot reasoning tasks. Applied to
LLaMA3.2-3B, LieQ maintains 98.2% of baseline accuracy at 2.07-bit precision
while enabling 4x memory reduction, establishing new paradigms for deploying
small language models on resource-constrained edge devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统TDS方法提取氢陷阱参数（结合能和密度）存在挑战，需要间接方法。

Method: 开发了一个由分类和回归神经网络组成的模型，仅使用合成数据训练，直接从实验数据预测陷阱参数。

Result: 模型在三种不同成分的回火马氏体钢上表现出强大的预测能力。

Conclusion: 该模型为氢陷阱参数提取提供了高效工具，代码已开源。

Abstract: The hydrogen trapping behaviour of metallic alloys is generally characterised
using Thermal Desorption Spectroscopy (TDS). However, as an indirect method,
extracting key parameters (trap binding energies and densities) remains a
significant challenge. To address these limitations, this work introduces a
machine learning-based scheme for parameter identification from TDS spectra. A
multi-Neural Network (NN) model is developed and trained exclusively on
synthetic data to predict trapping parameters directly from experimental data.
The model comprises two multi-layer, fully connected, feed-forward NNs trained
with backpropagation. The first network (classification model) predicts the
number of distinct trap types. The second network (regression model) then
predicts the corresponding trap densities and binding energies. The NN
architectures, hyperparameters, and data pre-processing were optimised to
minimise the amount of training data. The proposed model demonstrated strong
predictive capabilities when applied to three tempered martensitic steels of
different compositions. The code developed is freely provided.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统分类方法在实时健康监测中需要持续标注的不切实际问题，提供非侵入式、个性化的异常检测方案。

Method: 利用UniTS时间序列模型和可穿戴设备数据，通过异常检测而非分类方法实现实时监测。

Result: 在F1分数上优于12种现有方法，提升约22%，并在实际家庭环境中成功部署。

Conclusion: 系统证明了非临床设备也能实现高质量健康监测，并通过LLM增强结果的可解释性。

Abstract: We introduce AI on the Pulse, a real-world-ready anomaly detection system
that continuously monitors patients using a fusion of wearable sensors, ambient
intelligence, and advanced AI models. Powered by UniTS, a state-of-the-art
(SoTA) universal time-series model, our framework autonomously learns each
patient's unique physiological and behavioral patterns, detecting subtle
deviations that signal potential health risks. Unlike classification methods
that require impractical, continuous labeling in real-world scenarios, our
approach uses anomaly detection to provide real-time, personalized alerts for
reactive home-care interventions. Our approach outperforms 12 SoTA anomaly
detection methods, demonstrating robustness across both high-fidelity medical
devices (ECG) and consumer wearables, with a ~ 22% improvement in F1 score.
However, the true impact of AI on the Pulse lies in @HOME, where it has been
successfully deployed for continuous, real-world patient monitoring. By
operating with non-invasive, lightweight devices like smartwatches, our system
proves that high-quality health monitoring is possible without clinical-grade
equipment. Beyond detection, we enhance interpretability by integrating LLMs,
translating anomaly scores into clinically meaningful insights for healthcare
professionals.

Motivation: 药物发现过程中数据和工具的分散导致设计周期缓慢，因此需要一种自动化框架来加速分子优化。

Result: 多代理设置将平均预测结合亲和力提高了31%，而单代理生成的分子具有更好的药物特性。

Conclusion: 多代理框架可将通用LLM转化为可审计的分子设计系统，未来扩展工具集可进一步推动药物发现流程。

Abstract: Drug discovery frequently loses momentum when data, expertise, and tools are
scattered, slowing design cycles. To shorten this loop we built a hierarchical,
tool using agent framework that automates molecular optimisation. A Principal
Researcher defines each objective, a Database agent retrieves target
information, an AI Expert generates de novo scaffolds with a sequence to
molecule deep learning model, a Medicinal Chemist edits them while invoking a
docking tool, a Ranking agent scores the candidates, and a Scientific Critic
polices the logic. Each tool call is summarised and stored causing the full
reasoning path to remain inspectable. The agents communicate through concise
provenance records that capture molecular lineage, to build auditable, molecule
centered reasoning trajectories and reuse successful transformations via in
context learning. Three cycle research loops were run against AKT1 protein
using five large language models. After ranking the models by mean docking
score, we ran 20 independent scale ups on the two top performers. We then
compared the leading LLMs' binding affinity results across three
configurations, LLM only, single agent, and multi agent. Our results reveal an
architectural trade off, the multi agent setting excelled at focused binding
optimization, improving average predicted binding affinity by 31%. In contrast,
single agent runs generated molecules with superior drug like properties at the
cost of less potent binding scores. Unguided LLM runs finished fastest, yet
their lack of transparent tool signals left the validity of their reasoning
paths unverified. These results show that test time scaling, focused feedback
loops and provenance convert general purpose LLMs into auditable systems for
molecular design, and suggest that extending the toolset to ADMET and
selectivity predictors could push research workflows further along the
discovery pipeline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注单轮任务，而现实问题（如软件工程）需要多轮交互，因此需探索更通用的强化学习方法。

Method: 使用改进的DAPO算法，基于Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct模型训练智能体，解决软件工程任务。

Result: 在SWE-bench Verified基准测试中，成功率从20%提升至39%，并在SWE-rebench中优于其他领先模型。

Conclusion: 该方法为基于开放模型构建更强大的自主智能体提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Research on applications of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to Large Language
Models (LLMs) has mostly been focused on single-turn problems, such as
mathematical reasoning or single-shot code generation. While these problems can
be viewed as token-level multi-turn MDPs, this view corresponds to a degenerate
case of multi-turn interaction where the environment provides no feedback. This
contrasts with many real-world domains, such as software engineering (SWE),
which require rich multi-turn interactions with a stateful environment that
responds to each action with a non-trivial observation.
  To bridge this gap, we demonstrate the successful application of RL to this
general regime. Using a modified Decoupled Advantage Policy Optimization (DAPO)
algorithm, we train an agent based on Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct to solve real-world
software engineering tasks. Our approach increases the agent's success rate on
the SWE-bench Verified benchmark from a 20% rejection fine-tuned baseline to
39%, without relying on any teacher models. On SWE-rebench, our agent matches
or outperforms leading open-weight models such as DeepSeek-V3-0324 and
Qwen3-235B-A22B using an identical scaffolding, offering a viable path toward
building more capable autonomous agents for complex real-world problems based
on open models.

TL;DR: SLA-MORL是一个基于多目标强化学习的框架，用于动态分配云环境中的GPU和CPU资源，优化训练时间和成本，同时满足SLA约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统静态资源分配或单目标优化方法容易导致SLA违规或资源浪费，无法满足现代机器学习工作负载的需求。

Method: SLA-MORL通过智能初始化和动态权重适应，构建21维状态表示，利用actor-critic网络进行资源分配决策。

Result: 在13种不同ML工作负载上，SLA-MORL显著减少训练时间（67.2%）、成本（68.8%）并提高SLA合规性（73.4%）。

Conclusion: SLA-MORL通过解决冷启动和动态适应问题，为云资源管理提供了高效、可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Dynamic resource allocation for machine learning workloads in cloud
environments remains challenging due to competing objectives of minimizing
training time and operational costs while meeting Service Level Agreement (SLA)
constraints. Traditional approaches employ static resource allocation or
single-objective optimization, leading to either SLA violations or resource
waste. We present SLA-MORL, an adaptive multi-objective reinforcement learning
framework that intelligently allocates GPU and CPU resources based on
user-defined preferences (time, cost, or balanced) while ensuring SLA
compliance. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (1) intelligent
initialization through historical learning or efficient baseline runs that
eliminates cold-start problems, reducing initial exploration overhead by 60%,
and (2) dynamic weight adaptation that automatically adjusts optimization
priorities based on real-time SLA violation severity, creating a
self-correcting system. SLA-MORL constructs a 21-dimensional state
representation capturing resource utilization, training progress, and SLA
compliance, enabling an actor-critic network to make informed allocation
decisions across 9 possible actions. Extensive evaluation on 13 diverse ML
workloads using production HPC infrastructure demonstrates that SLA-MORL
achieves 67.2% reduction in training time for deadline-critical jobs, 68.8%
reduction in costs for budget-constrained workloads, and 73.4% improvement in
overall SLA compliance compared to static baselines. By addressing both
cold-start inefficiency and dynamic adaptation challenges, SLA-MORL provides a
practical solution for cloud resource management that balances performance,
cost, and reliability in modern ML training environments.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为MoKA的新型Kronecker适配器，通过混合Kronecker乘积和门控机制提升表达力，在参数效率和性能之间取得更好平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低秩适配器因秩限制导致的表达力不足问题，提升复杂任务性能。

Method: 采用混合Kronecker乘积建模权重更新，引入门控机制衡量各Kronecker因子的重要性，并优化计算以实现硬件效率。

Result: 在指令微调和常识推理任务中，MoKA优于现有PEFT基线，参数减少高达27倍，性能与参数效率达到最优平衡。

Conclusion: MoKA通过混合Kronecker适配器和硬件优化，显著提升了参数效率和性能，适用于大规模语言模型。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) is essential for reducing the
computational overhead of large language models (LLMs). Low-rank family
adapters are commonly used to control the parameter size efficiently while
maintaining the generative power of LLMs. However, their limited expressiveness
due to the rank constraint often restricts their performance on complex tasks.
We propose Mixture of Kronecker Adapters (MoKA), a new generation of Kronecker
adapters that addresses this limitation by modeling weight updates as a mixture
of Kronecker products. Our proposed adapter leverages a gating mechanism that
measures the importance of each Kronecker factor, enabling more expressive
adaptation. Moreover, MoKA enables a rank flexibility that provides a better
trade-off between parameter efficiency and accuracy. To ensure hardware
efficiency, we reformulate Kronecker computations using standard matrix
operations, allowing seamless deployment on GPU-optimized hardware. We conduct
extensive experiments on instruction-tuning and commonsense reasoning tasks
using low-bit quantized versions of LLaMA2-7B and LLaMA3-8B models. MoKA not
only outperforms PEFT baselines, but also reduces the number of trainable
parameters up to 27x, achieving state-of-the-art trade-offs between performance
and parameter efficiency.

TL;DR: VRPRM通过视觉推理和两阶段训练策略，以更低的数据标注成本提升推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PRM缺乏长期推理和深度思考能力，而CoT-PRM数据标注成本过高。

Method: 提出VRPRM，结合视觉推理，设计高效的两阶段训练策略。

Result: 仅用少量数据，VRPRM性能超越传统PRM，相对提升达118%。

Conclusion: VRPRM为PRM训练提供了高效数据利用的新范式。

Abstract: Process Reward Model (PRM) is widely used in the post-training of Large
Language Model (LLM) because it can perform fine-grained evaluation of the
reasoning steps of generated content. However, most PRMs lack long-term
reasoning and deep thinking capabilities. On the other hand, although a few
works have tried to introduce Chain-of-Thought capability into PRMs, the
annotation cost of CoT-PRM data is too expensive to play a stable role in
various tasks. To address the above challenges, we propose VRPRM, a process
reward model via visual reasoning, and design an efficient two-stage training
strategy. Experimental results show that using only 3.6K CoT-PRM SFT data and
50K non-CoT PRM RL training data, VRPRM can surpass the non-thinking PRM with a
total data volume of 400K and achieved a relative performance improvement of up
to 118\% over the base model in the BoN experiment. This result confirms that
the proposed combined training strategy can achieve higher quality reasoning
capabilities at a lower data annotation cost, thus providing a new paradigm for
PRM training with more efficient data utilization.

TL;DR: Horus是一个针对联邦学习中异构性和投毒攻击的鲁棒性框架，通过低秩适应（LoRAs）减少攻击面并过滤恶意客户端。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在高度异构环境下易受投毒攻击，传统聚合策略效果不佳且难以检测攻击。

Method: Horus利用LoRAs插入稳定层，仅聚合LoRAs，并通过LoRA-A的稳定性设计过滤机制和投影感知聚合。

Result: 实验表明Horus在多种数据集和攻击下均优于现有方法，鲁棒性和准确性显著提升。

Conclusion: Horus通过LoRAs和新型过滤机制有效解决了异构联邦学习中的投毒攻击问题。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) remains highly vulnerable to poisoning attacks,
especially under real-world hyper-heterogeneity, where clients differ
significantly in data distributions, communication capabilities, and model
architectures. Such heterogeneity not only undermines the effectiveness of
aggregation strategies but also makes attacks more difficult to detect.
Furthermore, high-dimensional models expand the attack surface. To address
these challenges, we propose Horus, a heterogeneity-oblivious robust FL
framework centered on low-rank adaptations (LoRAs). Rather than aggregating
full model parameters, Horus inserts LoRAs into empirically stable layers and
aggregates only LoRAs to reduce the attack surface.We uncover a key empirical
observation that the input projection (LoRA-A) is markedly more stable than the
output projection (LoRA-B) under heterogeneity and poisoning. Leveraging this,
we design a Heterogeneity-Oblivious Poisoning Score using the features from
LoRA-A to filter poisoned clients. For the remaining benign clients, we propose
projection-aware aggregation mechanism to preserve collaborative signals while
suppressing drifts, which reweights client updates by consistency with the
global directions. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets, model
architectures, and attacks demonstrate that Horus consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in both robustness and accuracy.

Method: 提出DeepFaith框架，整合多指标优化，设计学习框架训练解释器。

Result: 在12个任务中，DeepFaith在10个指标上表现最优。

Conclusion: DeepFaith提供理论上的最优解释，具有跨领域泛化能力。

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) builds trust in complex systems through model
attribution methods that reveal the decision rationale. However, due to the
absence of a unified optimal explanation, existing XAI methods lack a ground
truth for objective evaluation and optimization. To address this issue, we
propose Deep architecture-based Faith explainer (DeepFaith), a domain-free and
model-agnostic unified explanation framework under the lens of faithfulness. By
establishing a unified formulation for multiple widely used and well-validated
faithfulness metrics, we derive an optimal explanation objective whose solution
simultaneously achieves optimal faithfulness across these metrics, thereby
providing a ground truth from a theoretical perspective. We design an explainer
learning framework that leverages multiple existing explanation methods,
applies deduplicating and filtering to construct high-quality supervised
explanation signals, and optimizes both pattern consistency loss and local
correlation to train a faithful explainer. Once trained, DeepFaith can generate
highly faithful explanations through a single forward pass without accessing
the model being explained. On 12 diverse explanation tasks spanning 6 models
and 6 datasets, DeepFaith achieves the highest overall faithfulness across 10
metrics compared to all baseline methods, highlighting its effectiveness and
cross-domain generalizability.

Motivation: 传统变分自编码器（VAE）训练中，随机采样潜在变量会引入估计方差，影响收敛和性能。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用特定解码器架构解析计算ELBO期望，提出零方差梯度方法，并通过新型训练动态结合标准随机估计器。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多个数据集上优于现有基线（如重参数化、Gumbel-Softmax和REINFORCE）。

Conclusion: Silent Gradients为生成模型训练提供了新方向，结合解析计算的稳定性和深度非线性架构的表达能力。

Abstract: Training deep generative models like Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) is often
hindered by the need to backpropagate gradients through the stochastic sampling
of their latent variables, a process that inherently introduces estimation
variance, which can slow convergence and degrade performance. In this paper, we
propose a new perspective that sidesteps this problem, which we call Silent
Gradients. Instead of improving stochastic estimators, we leverage specific
decoder architectures to analytically compute the expected ELBO, yielding a
gradient with zero variance. We first provide a theoretical foundation for this
method and demonstrate its superiority over existing estimators in a controlled
setting with a linear decoder. To generalize our approach for practical use
with complex, expressive decoders, we introduce a novel training dynamic that
uses the exact, zero-variance gradient to guide the early stages of encoder
training before annealing to a standard stochastic estimator. Our experiments
show that this technique consistently improves the performance of established
baselines, including reparameterization, Gumbel-Softmax, and REINFORCE, across
multiple datasets. This work opens a new direction for training generative
models by combining the stability of analytical computation with the
expressiveness of deep, nonlinear architecture.

TL;DR: VITA是一种变分预训练框架，通过自监督特征掩码学习预测天气状态，解决了农业产量预测中数据不对称问题，并在极端天气年份表现优异。


<details>

Motivation: 解决当前AI模型在产量偏离历史趋势时表现不佳的问题，尤其是数据不对称性（丰富的预训练天气数据与有限的微调数据之间的差异）。

Method: 引入VITA框架，利用天气变量作为代理目标进行预训练，通过自监督特征掩码学习预测大气状态，仅需基本天气统计数据进行微调。

Result: 在美国玉米带的763个县中，VITA在预测玉米和大豆产量方面表现最佳，尤其在极端天气年份有显著改进（p≈0.01）。

Conclusion: VITA通过领域感知的AI设计克服数据限制，为气候变化下的农业预测提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate crop yield forecasting is essential for global food security.
However, current AI models systematically underperform when yields deviate from
historical trends. This issue arises from key data challenges, including a
major asymmetry between rich pretraining weather datasets and the limited data
available for fine-tuning. We introduce VITA (Variational Inference Transformer
for Asymmetric data), a variational pretraining framework that addresses this
asymmetry. Instead of relying on input reconstruction, VITA uses detailed
weather variables as proxy targets during pretraining and learns to predict
rich atmospheric states through self-supervised feature masking. This allows
the model to be fine-tuned using only basic weather statistics during
deployment. Applied to 763 counties in the U.S. Corn Belt, VITA achieves
state-of-the-art performance in predicting corn and soybean yields across all
evaluation scenarios. While it consistently delivers superior performance under
normal conditions, its advantages are particularly pronounced during extreme
weather years, with statistically significant improvements (paired t-test, $p
\approx 0.01$). Importantly, VITA outperforms prior frameworks like GNN-RNN
using less data, making it more practical for real-world use--particularly in
data-scarce regions. This work highlights how domain-aware AI design can
overcome data limitations and support resilient agricultural forecasting in a
changing climate.

Motivation: 传统数值天气预报模型计算成本高且依赖复杂物理模拟，SolarSeer旨在通过AI直接映射历史卫星数据到未来预测，提升效率和精度。

Method: SolarSeer利用历史卫星观测数据直接生成预测，避免了数据同化和偏微分方程求解的计算开销。

Result: SolarSeer比传统模型快1500倍，预测误差降低27.28%（再分析数据）和15.35%（1800个站点），并能有效捕捉辐照度波动。

Conclusion: SolarSeer为可持续能源系统提供了快速、准确的太阳辐照度预测支持。

Abstract: Accurate 24-hour solar irradiance forecasting is essential for the safe and
economic operation of solar photovoltaic systems. Traditional numerical weather
prediction (NWP) models represent the state-of-the-art in forecasting
performance but rely on computationally costly data assimilation and solving
complicated partial differential equations (PDEs) that simulate atmospheric
physics. Here, we introduce SolarSeer, an end-to-end large artificial
intelligence (AI) model for solar irradiance forecasting across the Contiguous
United States (CONUS). SolarSeer is designed to directly map the historical
satellite observations to future forecasts, eliminating the computational
overhead of data assimilation and PDEs solving. This efficiency allows
SolarSeer to operate over 1,500 times faster than traditional NWP, generating
24-hour cloud cover and solar irradiance forecasts for the CONUS at 5-kilometer
resolution in under 3 seconds. Compared with the state-of-the-art NWP in the
CONUS, i.e., High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR), SolarSeer significantly
reduces the root mean squared error of solar irradiance forecasting by 27.28%
in reanalysis data and 15.35% across 1,800 stations. SolarSeer also effectively
captures solar irradiance fluctuations and significantly enhances the
first-order irradiance difference forecasting accuracy. SolarSeer's ultrafast,
accurate 24-hour solar irradiance forecasts provide strong support for the
transition to sustainable, net-zero energy systems.

Conclusion: 研究为机器学习从业者提供了优化评估数据收集的方法，帮助他们在预算内选择最优的N和K配置，提高评估的可靠性。

Abstract: Reproducibility is a cornerstone of scientific validation and of the
authority it confers on its results. Reproducibility in machine learning
evaluations leads to greater trust, confidence, and value. However, the ground
truth responses used in machine learning often necessarily come from humans,
among whom disagreement is prevalent, and surprisingly little research has
studied the impact of effectively ignoring disagreement in these responses, as
is typically the case. One reason for the lack of research is that budgets for
collecting human-annotated evaluation data are limited, and obtaining more
samples from multiple annotators for each example greatly increases the
per-item annotation costs. We investigate the trade-off between the number of
items ($N$) and the number of responses per item ($K$) needed for reliable
machine learning evaluation. We analyze a diverse collection of categorical
datasets for which multiple annotations per item exist, and simulated
distributions fit to these datasets, to determine the optimal $(N, K)$
configuration, given a fixed budget ($N \times K$), for collecting evaluation
data and reliably comparing the performance of machine learning models. Our
findings show, first, that accounting for human disagreement may come with $N
\times K$ at no more than 1000 (and often much lower) for every dataset tested
on at least one metric. Moreover, this minimal $N \times K$ almost always
occurred for $K > 10$. Furthermore, the nature of the tradeoff between $K$ and
$N$ -- or if one even existed -- depends on the evaluation metric, with metrics
that are more sensitive to the full distribution of responses performing better
at higher levels of $K$. Our methods can be used to help ML practitioners get
more effective test data by finding the optimal metrics and number of items and
annotations per item to collect to get the most reliability for their budget.

*Bhavesh Neekhra,Debayan Gupta,Partha Pratim Chakravarti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现，在高维数据集（如基因表达）的分类任务中，特征选择（FS）算法并不比随机选择特征更有优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证特征选择算法在高维数据集中的实际效果，挑战现有研究的结论。

Method: 通过比较随机选择特征和FS算法选择特征的模型性能，测试FS算法的有效性。

Result: 随机选择的小特征子集（0.02%-1%）与FS算法选择的特征表现相当或更好。

Conclusion: FS算法在高维数据集中的效果被质疑，需谨慎依赖计算选择的基因进行药物设计或干预研究。

Abstract: Extensive research has been done on feature selection (FS) algorithms for
high-dimensional datasets aiming to improve model performance, reduce
computational cost and identify features of interest. We test the null
hypothesis of using randomly selected features to compare against features
selected by FS algorithms to validate the performance of the latter. Our
results show that FS on high-dimensional datasets (in particular gene
expression) in classification tasks is not useful. We find that (1) models
trained on small subsets (0.02%-1% of all features) of randomly selected
features almost always perform comparably to those trained on all features, and
(2) a "typical"- sized random subset provides comparable or superior
performance to that of top-k features selected in various published studies.
Thus, our work challenges many feature selection results on high dimensional
datasets, particularly in computational genomics. It raises serious concerns
about studies that propose drug design or targeted interventions based on
computationally selected genes, without further validation in a wet lab.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升自动定理证明的性能，通过创新方法解决模型训练中的多样性和复杂性挑战。

Method: 采用专家迭代和强化学习流程，结合合成数据、验证器引导的自我修正和模型平均技术。

Result: 小模型Goedel-Prover-V2-8B在MiniF2F上达到84.6% pass@32，旗舰模型Goedel-Prover-V2-32B在标准模式下达到88.1%，自我修正模式下达到90.4%，显著超越之前SOTA。

Conclusion: Goedel-Prover-V2在开源定理证明器中表现最强，并在计算预算受限的情况下表现优异。

Abstract: We introduce Goedel-Prover-V2, a series of open-source language models that
set a new state-of-the-art in automated theorem proving. Built on the standard
expert iteration and reinforcement learning pipeline, our approach incorporates
three key innovations: (1) Scaffolded data synthesis: We generate synthetic
tasks of increasing difficulty to train the model to master increasingly
complex theorems; (2) Verifier-guided self-correction: We enable the model to
iteratively revise its proofs by leveraging feedback from the Lean compiler;
(3) Model averaging: We merge model checkpoints to mitigate the decrease in
model output diversity in later stages of training. Our small model,
Goedel-Prover-V2-8B, reaches 84.6% pass@32 on MiniF2F and outperforms
DeepSeek-Prover-V2-671B under the same metric, despite being 80X smaller. Our
flagship model, Goedel-Prover-V2-32B, achieves 88.1% on MiniF2F at pass@32 in
standard mode and 90.4% in self-correction mode, outperforming prior SOTA by a
large margin. Additionally, our flagship model solves 86 problems on
PutnamBench at pass@184, securing the first place among open-source models on
the leaderboard, surpassing DeepSeek-Prover-V2-671B's record of solving 47
problems by pass@1024 with a significantly smaller model size and compute
budget. At the time of its release (July-August 2025), Goedel-Prover-V2
achieves the strongest overall performance among all open-source theorem
provers. It also ranks among the top-performing models--including closed-source
systems with publicly reported performance--under a constrained test-time
compute budget. Our models, code, and data are released at

TL;DR: MinConvLSTM和MinConvGRU是两种新型时空模型，结合了卷积循环网络的空间归纳偏置和高效训练的最小化并行RNN。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统ConvRNN模型在训练时因顺序隐藏状态更新导致的效率瓶颈问题。

Method: 将MinLSTM和MinGRU的对数域前缀和公式扩展到卷积架构，并引入指数门控机制。

Result: 在Navier-Stokes动力学和真实世界位势数据任务中，训练速度显著优于标准ConvLSTM和ConvGRU，且预测误差更低。

Conclusion: 最小化循环结构与卷积输入结合，为时空序列建模提供了高效且性能优越的替代方案。

Abstract: We introduce MinConvLSTM and MinConvGRU, two novel spatiotemporal models that
combine the spatial inductive biases of convolutional recurrent networks with
the training efficiency of minimal, parallelizable RNNs. Our approach extends
the log-domain prefix-sum formulation of MinLSTM and MinGRU to convolutional
architectures, enabling fully parallel training while retaining localized
spatial modeling. This eliminates the need for sequential hidden state updates
during teacher forcing - a major bottleneck in conventional ConvRNN models. In
addition, we incorporate an exponential gating mechanism inspired by the xLSTM
architecture into the MinConvLSTM, which further simplifies the log-domain
computation. Our models are structurally minimal and computationally efficient,
with reduced parameter count and improved scalability. We evaluate our models
on two spatiotemporal forecasting tasks: Navier-Stokes dynamics and real-world
geopotential data. In terms of training speed, our architectures significantly
outperform standard ConvLSTMs and ConvGRUs. Moreover, our models also achieve
lower prediction errors in both domains, even in closed-loop autoregressive
mode. These findings demonstrate that minimal recurrent structures, when
combined with convolutional input aggregation, offer a compelling and efficient
alternative for spatiotemporal sequence modeling, bridging the gap between
recurrent simplicity and spatial complexity.

Motivation: 探讨高斯混合模型样本复杂度的结构特性，揭示传统基于最小间隔的视角不完整。

Method: 引入Pair Correlation Factor (PCF)作为新的几何量，并在均匀球形情况下提出改进算法。

Result: PCF能更准确地决定参数恢复的难度，算法在特定情况下改进了样本复杂度界限。

Conclusion: PCF是理解GMM样本复杂度的关键因素，传统的最小间隔视角存在局限性。

Abstract: We study the problem of learning Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) and ask:
which structural properties govern their sample complexity? Prior work has
largely tied this complexity to the minimum pairwise separation between
components, but we demonstrate this view is incomplete.
  We introduce the \emph{Pair Correlation Factor} (PCF), a geometric quantity
capturing the clustering of component means. Unlike the minimum gap, the PCF
more accurately dictates the difficulty of parameter recovery.
  In the uniform spherical case, we give an algorithm with improved sample
complexity bounds, showing when more than the usual $\epsilon^{-2}$ samples are
necessary.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于患者特定权重的预训练模型微调方法，以解决癫痫患者数据分布差异导致的跨患者问题，实验显示分类准确率平均提升10%以上。

Motivation: 癫痫手术需准确定位发作起始区，但依赖专家视觉判断且患者数据分布差异大，机器学习模型在新患者数据上表现不稳定。

Result: 实验采用留一患者法，结果显示每位测试患者的分类准确率均有提升，平均提升超过10%。

Conclusion: 提出的患者特定权重微调方法有效解决了跨患者问题，提升了模型在新患者数据上的诊断性能。

Abstract: Identifying the seizure onset zone (SOZ) in patients with focal epilepsy is
essential for surgical treatment and remains challenging due to its dependence
on visual judgment by clinical experts. The development of machine learning can
assist in diagnosis and has made promising progress. However, unlike data in
other fields, medical data is usually collected from individual patients, and
each patient has different illnesses, physical conditions, and medical
histories, which leads to differences in the distribution of each patient's
data. This makes it difficult for a machine learning model to achieve
consistently reliable performance in every new patient dataset, which we refer
to as the "cross-patient problem." In this paper, we propose a method to
fine-tune a pretrained model using patient-specific weights for every new test
patient to improve diagnostic performance. First, the supervised learning
method is used to train a machine learning model. Next, using the intermediate
features of the trained model obtained through the test patient data, the
similarity between the test patient data and each training patient's data is
defined to determine the weight of each training patient to be used in the
following fine-tuning. Finally, we fine-tune all parameters in the pretrained
model with training data and patient weights. In the experiment, the
leave-one-patient-out method is used to evaluate the proposed method, and the
results show improved classification accuracy for every test patient, with an
average improvement of more than 10%.

Result: 结构规律性诱导的表征几何在架构变化下更稳定，表明某些归纳偏置能提升跨模型特征互操作性。

Conclusion: 研究结果对模型蒸馏、模块化学习及稳健学习系统的设计具有启示意义。

Abstract: The internal representations learned by deep networks are often sensitive to
architecture-specific choices, raising questions about the stability,
alignment, and transferability of learned structure across models. In this
paper, we investigate how structural constraints--such as linear shaping
operators and corrective paths--affect the compatibility of internal
representations across different architectures. Building on the insights from
prior studies on structured transformations and convergence, we develop a
framework for measuring and analyzing representational alignment across
networks with distinct but related architectural priors. Through a combination
of theoretical insights, empirical probes, and controlled transfer experiments,
we demonstrate that structural regularities induce representational geometry
that is more stable under architectural variation. This suggests that certain
forms of inductive bias not only support generalization within a model, but
also improve the interoperability of learned features across models. We
conclude with a discussion on the implications of representational
transferability for model distillation, modular learning, and the principled
design of robust learning systems.

Motivation: 形态感知策略在零样本性能上表现不佳，而端到端微调计算成本高，因此探索PEFT技术以优化策略适应。

Method: 比较了直接调整模型权重子集、输入可学习适配器和前缀调优技术，用于在线微调。

Result: PEFT技术结合预训练显著减少了提升策略性能所需的样本量，且仅调整不到1%的参数即可优于零样本性能。

Conclusion: PEFT技术与形态感知预训练结合，能有效降低计算成本并提升策略性能。

Abstract: Morphology-aware policy learning is a means of enhancing policy sample
efficiency by aggregating data from multiple agents. These types of policies
have previously been shown to help generalize over dynamic, kinematic, and limb
configuration variations between agent morphologies. Unfortunately, these
policies still have sub-optimal zero-shot performance compared to end-to-end
finetuning on morphologies at deployment. This limitation has ramifications in
practical applications such as robotics because further data collection to
perform end-to-end finetuning can be computationally expensive. In this work,
we investigate combining morphology-aware pretraining with parameter efficient
finetuning (PEFT) techniques to help reduce the learnable parameters necessary
to specialize a morphology-aware policy to a target embodiment. We compare
directly tuning sub-sets of model weights, input learnable adapters, and prefix
tuning techniques for online finetuning. Our analysis reveals that PEFT
techniques in conjunction with policy pre-training generally help reduce the
number of samples to necessary to improve a policy compared to training models
end-to-end from scratch. We further find that tuning as few as less than 1% of
total parameters will improve policy performance compared the zero-shot
performance of the base pretrained a policy.

Motivation: 解决LLMs输出缺乏可验证保证的问题，通过契约层提供语义和类型验证。

Method: 引入契约层，规定输入输出的语义和类型要求，并结合概率修复机制引导生成合规输出。

Result: 契约层实现了LLMs作为语义解析器和概率黑盒的双重视图，验证了契约的满足是概率性的。

Conclusion: 任何满足相同契约的代理在功能上是等价的，为LLMs的可信性提供了新视角。

Abstract: Generative models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), produce fluent
outputs yet lack verifiable guarantees. We adapt Design by Contract (DbC) and
type-theoretic principles to introduce a contract layer that mediates every LLM
call. Contracts stipulate semantic and type requirements on inputs and outputs,
coupled with probabilistic remediation to steer generation toward compliance.
The layer exposes the dual view of LLMs as semantic parsers and probabilistic
black-box components. Contract satisfaction is probabilistic and semantic
validation is operationally defined through programmer-specified conditions on
well-typed data structures. More broadly, this work postulates that any two
agents satisfying the same contracts are \emph{functionally equivalent} with
respect to those contracts.

Result: 实验验证了SkyGP在性能和效率上的优越性，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SkyGP有效解决了高斯过程在流数据中的计算和内存问题，同时保持了性能优势。

Abstract: Gaussian Processes (GPs), as a nonparametric learning method, offer flexible
modeling capabilities and calibrated uncertainty quantification for function
approximations. Additionally, GPs support online learning by efficiently
incorporating new data with polynomial-time computation, making them
well-suited for safety-critical dynamical systems that require rapid
adaptation. However, the inference and online updates of exact GPs, when
processing streaming data, incur cubic computation time and quadratic storage
memory complexity, limiting their scalability to large datasets in real-time
settings. In this paper, we propose a \underline{s}treaming
\underline{k}ernel-induced progressivel\underline{y} generated expert framework
of \underline{G}aussian \underline{p}rocesses (SkyGP) that addresses both
computational and memory constraints by maintaining a bounded set of experts,
while inheriting the learning performance guarantees from exact Gaussian
processes. Furthermore, two SkyGP variants are introduced, each tailored to a
specific objective, either maximizing prediction accuracy (SkyGP-Dense) or
improving computational efficiency (SkyGP-Fast). The effectiveness of SkyGP is
validated through extensive benchmarks and real-time control experiments
demonstrating its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Method: 提出SQLM框架，采用非对称自博弈方式：提议者生成问题，解答者尝试回答，两者通过强化学习训练。提议者根据问题难度获得奖励，解答者根据多数投票（正确性代理）获得奖励。

Result: 在三位数乘法、OMEGA代数题和Codeforces编程题三个基准测试中验证了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 语言模型通过持续生成和解决问题，可以在无需外部数据的情况下提升下游任务表现。

Abstract: Can large language models improve without external data -- by generating
their own questions and answers? We hypothesize that a pre-trained language
model can improve its reasoning skills given only a single prompt specifying
the topic (e.g., algebra word problems) and asking the model to generate its
own questions. To do this, we propose Self-Questioning Language Models (SQLM):
an asymmetric self-play framework where a proposer is given the topic and
generates a question for a solver, who tries to answer it. Both the proposer
and solver are trained via reinforcement learning. The proposer receives a
reward if the problem is not too easy or too difficult, and the solver receives
a reward based on majority voting, a proxy for correctness in the absence of
ground-truth answers. For coding, the proposer can instead generate unit tests
which are used for verification. We study this asymmetric self-play framework
on three benchmarks: three-digit multiplication, algebra problems from the
OMEGA benchmark, and programming problems from Codeforces. By continually
generating more interesting problems and attempting to solve them, language
models can improve on downstream benchmarks without access to any curated
training datasets.

Motivation: 随着AI系统自主性增强，确保其决策与人类偏好一致至关重要。传统IRL方法需要大量人类演示以保证可靠性，但成本高昂。

Method: 提出PAC-EIG和Reward-EIG两种信息理论获取函数，分别针对策略的遗憾最小化和奖励学习目标，通过高效选择需要进一步演示的状态。

Result: 在有限状态-动作空间中，证明了收敛性边界，并通过实验验证了方法的优势，同时揭示了先前启发式方法的失败模式。

Conclusion: PAC-EIG为主动IRL提供了首个理论保证，显著减少了获取可靠策略所需的人类演示成本。

Abstract: As AI systems become increasingly autonomous, reliably aligning their
decision-making to human preferences is essential. Inverse reinforcement
learning (IRL) offers a promising approach to infer preferences from
demonstrations. These preferences can then be used to produce an apprentice
policy that performs well on the demonstrated task. However, in domains like
autonomous driving or robotics, where errors can have serious consequences, we
need not just good average performance but reliable policies with formal
guarantees -- yet obtaining sufficient human demonstrations for reliability
guarantees can be costly. Active IRL addresses this challenge by strategically
selecting the most informative scenarios for human demonstration. We introduce
PAC-EIG, an information-theoretic acquisition function that directly targets
probably-approximately-correct (PAC) guarantees for the learned policy --
providing the first such theoretical guarantee for active IRL with noisy expert
demonstrations. Our method maximises information gain about the regret of the
apprentice policy, efficiently identifying states requiring further
demonstration. We also present Reward-EIG as an alternative when learning the
reward itself is the primary objective. Focusing on finite state-action spaces,
we prove convergence bounds, illustrate failure modes of prior heuristic
methods, and demonstrate our method's advantages experimentally.

Conclusion: UAV-FPG为无人机通信系统的抗干扰策略和智能决策提供了强大平台。

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have made significant advancements in
communication stability and security through techniques such as frequency
hopping, signal spreading, and adaptive interference suppression. However,
challenges remain in modeling spectrum competition, integrating expert
knowledge, and predicting opponent behavior. To address these issues, we
propose UAV-FPG (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle - Frequency Point Game), a
game-theoretic environment model that simulates the dynamic interaction between
interference and anti-interference strategies of opponent and ally UAVs in
communication frequency bands. The model incorporates a prior expert knowledge
base to optimize frequency selection and employs large language models for path
planning, simulating a "strong adversary". Experimental results highlight the
effectiveness of integrating the expert knowledge base and the large language
model, with the latter significantly improving path planning in dynamic
scenarios through iterative interactions, outperforming fixed-path strategies.
UAV-FPG provides a robust platform for advancing anti-jamming strategies and
intelligent decision-making in UAV communication systems.

Result: 在合作、竞争和混合多代理环境中，TransAM生成了强策略表示，提升了代理建模效果，并获得了更高的回报。

Conclusion: TransAM是一种有效的代理建模方法，仅需局部轨迹即可学习其他代理的策略，适用于多种多代理场景。

Abstract: Agent modeling is a critical component in developing effective policies
within multi-agent systems, as it enables agents to form beliefs about the
behaviors, intentions, and competencies of others. Many existing approaches
assume access to other agents' episodic trajectories, a condition often
unrealistic in real-world applications. Consequently, a practical agent
modeling approach must learn a robust representation of the policies of the
other agents based only on the local trajectory of the controlled agent. In
this paper, we propose \texttt{TransAM}, a novel transformer-based agent
modeling approach to encode local trajectories into an embedding space that
effectively captures the policies of other agents. We evaluate the performance
of the proposed method in cooperative, competitive, and mixed multi-agent
environments. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach
generates strong policy representations, improves agent modeling, and leads to
higher episodic returns.

Abstract: We compare the efficacy of learned versus engineered communication strategies
in a cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) environment. For the
learned approach, we introduce Learned Direct Communication (LDC), where agents
generate messages and actions concurrently via a neural network. Our engineered
approach, Intention Communication, employs an Imagined Trajectory Generation
Module (ITGM) and a Message Generation Network (MGN) to formulate messages
based on predicted future states. Both strategies are evaluated on their
success rates in cooperative tasks under fully and partially observable
conditions. Our findings indicate that while emergent communication is viable,
the engineered approach demonstrates superior performance and scalability,

performance for systems designed for continuous operation, where sustained
reliability is paramount. We account for uncertainty in transition kernels,
with players aiming to optimize their worst-case average reward. We first
establish a connection between the multi-agent and single agent settings, and
derive the solvability of the robust Bellman equation under the average-reward
formulation. We then rigorously prove the existence of a robust Nash
Equilibrium (NE), offering essential theoretical guarantees for system
stability. We further develop and analyze an algorithm named robust
Nash-Iteration to compute the robust Nash Equilibria among all agents,
providing practical tools for identifying optimal strategies in complex,
uncertain, and long-running multi-player environments. Finally, we demonstrate
the connection between the average-reward NE and the well-studied discounted
NEs, showing that the former can be approximated as the discount factor
approaches one. Together, these contributions provide a comprehensive
theoretical and algorithmic foundation for identifying optimal strategies in
complex, uncertain, and long-running multi-player environments, which allow for
the future extension of robust average-reward single-agent problems to the
multi-agent setting.

Method: 开发VisAug系统，自动生成基于语音内容的视觉增强。

Result: VisAug显著提升了视频信息的消费和参与度。

Conclusion: VisAug在视频驱动的数字环境中具有重要潜力。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of digital technology has ushered in a new era of
digital transformation across all aspects of our lives. Online learning,
social, and work activities, such as distance education, videoconferencing,
interviews, and talks, have led to a dramatic increase in speech-rich video
content. In contrast to other video types, such as surveillance footage, which
typically contain abundant visual cues, speech-rich videos convey most of their
meaningful information through the audio channel. This poses challenges for
improving content consumption using existing visual-based video summarization,
navigation, and exploration systems. In this paper, we present VisAug, a novel
interactive system designed to enhance speech-rich video navigation and
engagement by automatically generating informative and expressive visual
augmentations based on the speech content of videos. Our findings suggest that
this system has the potential to significantly enhance the consumption and
engagement of information in an increasingly video-driven digital landscape.

Abstract: Lifelogging refers to the process of passively collecting, storing, and
analysing personal daily life data using wearable devices. This data can
support applications in memory preservation and enhancement. For example, using
an ask-and-answer strategy, question-answering (QA) on lifelog data opens an
interactive and interesting way to explore memorable events and insights into
daily life. However, research resources for QA on lifelog data are limited to
small-sized or synthetic QA datasets. In this paper, we present a novel lifelog
QA dataset called OpenLifelogQA, building upon an 18-month lifelog dataset. Our
dataset focuses on an open-ended and practical QA with real-world application
in daily lifelog usage. We construct 14,187 pairs of Q&A with diverse types and
difficulty levels. A baseline experiment is reported for this dataset with
competitive average performance of 89.7% BERT Score, 25.87% ROUGE-L and 3.9665
LLM Score from LLaVA-NeXT-Interleave 7B model. We release this Q&A dataset to
the research community to support new research into lifelog technologies, such
as enabling personal chat-based assistants for lifelog data to become a

Motivation: 可穿戴辅助设备日益柔软，但其非线性与柔顺特性使得物理建模和嵌入式传感具有挑战性，需要一种新的方法来捕捉动态辅助的传递。

Method: 开发了一种基于图像和学习的框架，利用SoRoSim工具箱生成多样化的外骨骼几何和驱动场景数据集进行训练。

Result: 该方法能够从低分辨率灰度图像中准确估计多个接触点的相互作用力，并能泛化到未见过的形状和驱动水平，且在视觉噪声和对比度变化下保持鲁棒性。

Abstract: Wearable assistive devices are increasingly becoming softer. Modelling their
interface with human tissue is necessary to capture transmission of dynamic
assistance. However, their nonlinear and compliant nature makes both physical
modeling and embedded sensing challenging. In this paper, we develop a
image-based, learning-based framework to estimate distributed contact forces
for a finger-exosuit system. We used the SoRoSim toolbox to generate a diverse
dataset of exosuit geometries and actuation scenarios for training. The method
accurately estimated interaction forces across multiple contact locations from
low-resolution grayscale images, was able to generalize to unseen shapes and
actuation levels, and remained robust under visual noise and contrast
variations. We integrated the model into a feedback controller, and found that
the vision-based estimator functions as a surrogate force sensor for
closed-loop control. This approach could be used as a non-intrusive alternative
for real-time force estimation for exosuits.

Result: 实验和仿真结果表明，可调刚度能够显著提高机器人在不同地面条件下的能量效率，支持了研究假设。

Conclusion: 可调腿部刚度能够有效提升垂直跳跃机器人的能量效率，为未来控制器设计提供了重要参考。

Abstract: We present the design and implementation of HASTA (Hopper with Adjustable
Stiffness for Terrain Adaptation), a vertical hopping robot with real-time
tunable leg stiffness, aimed at optimizing energy efficiency across various
ground profiles (a pair of ground stiffness and damping conditions). By
adjusting leg stiffness, we aim to maximize apex hopping height, a key metric
for energy-efficient vertical hopping. We hypothesize that softer legs perform
better on soft, damped ground by minimizing penetration and energy loss, while
stiffer legs excel on hard, less damped ground by reducing limb deformation and
energy dissipation. Through experimental tests and simulations, we find the
best leg stiffness within our selection for each combination of ground
stiffness and damping, enabling the robot to achieve maximum steady-state
hopping height with a constant energy input. These results support our
hypothesis that tunable stiffness improves energy-efficient locomotion in
controlled experimental conditions. In addition, the simulation provides
insights that could aid in the future development of controllers for selecting
leg stiffness.

Abstract: Animal welfare education could greatly benefit from customized robots to help

safe child-animal interactions. To this end, we ran Participatory Design
workshops with animal welfare educators and children to identify key
requirements for zoomorphic robots from their perspectives. Our findings
encompass a zoomorphic robot's appearance, behavior, and features, as well as
concepts for a narrative surrounding the robot. Through comparing and
contrasting the two groups, we find the importance of: negative reactions to
undesirable behavior from children; using the facial features and tail to
provide cues signaling an animal's internal state; and a natural, furry
appearance and texture. We also contribute some novel activities for
Participatory Design with children, including branching storyboards inspired by
thematic apperception tests and interactive narratives, and reflect on some of
the key design challenges of achieving consensus between the groups, despite
much overlap in their design concepts.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种轻量级模块化框架CRI，用于实时量化方向性风险并动态调整控制命令，显著提升了自动驾驶的安全性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有风险评估方法要么输出粗粒度的全局指标缺乏可解释性，要么未具体集成到自动驾驶系统中，或仅针对特定场景。

Method: CRI基于对象运动学和空间关系，采用方向感知空间分区、混合概率-最大融合策略和自适应控制策略。

Result: 在Bench2Drive基准测试中，CRI显著减少了碰撞率（19%车辆碰撞/失败路线，20%碰撞/公里），提升了驾驶评分（17%），且运行时开销低（3.6毫秒/决策周期）。

Conclusion: CRI在复杂高风险环境中显著提升安全性和鲁棒性，同时保持模块化和低运行时开销。

Abstract: Ensuring safety in autonomous driving requires precise, real-time risk
assessment and adaptive behavior. Prior work on risk estimation either outputs
coarse, global scene-level metrics lacking interpretability, proposes
indicators without concrete integration into autonomous systems, or focuses
narrowly on specific driving scenarios. We introduce the Context-aware Risk
Index (CRI), a light-weight modular framework that quantifies directional risks
based on object kinematics and spatial relationships, dynamically adjusting
control commands in real time. CRI employs direction-aware spatial partitioning
within a dynamic safety envelope using Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS)
principles, a hybrid probabilistic-max fusion strategy for risk aggregation,
and an adaptive control policy for real-time behavior modulation. We evaluate
CRI on the Bench2Drive benchmark comprising 220 safety-critical scenarios using
a state-of-the-art end-to-end model Transfuser++ on challenging routes. Our
collision-rate metrics show a 19\% reduction (p = 0.003) in vehicle collisions
per failed route, a 20\% reduction (p = 0.004) in collisions per kilometer, a
17\% increase (p = 0.016) in composed driving score, and a statistically
significant reduction in penalty scores (p = 0.013) with very low overhead (3.6
ms per decision cycle). These results demonstrate that CRI substantially
improves safety and robustness in complex, risk-intensive environments while
maintaining modularity and low runtime overhead.

Conclusion: 该框架通过少量校准数据和微调步骤，实现了对新用户的高效适应和强泛化。

Abstract: This letter presents a model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) based framework
for simultaneous and accurate estimation of human gait phase and terrain
geometry using a small set of fabric-based wearable soft sensors, with
efficient adaptation to unseen subjects and strong generalization across
different subjects and terrains. Compared to rigid alternatives such as
inertial measurement units, fabric-based soft sensors improve comfort but
introduce nonlinearities due to hysteresis, placement error, and fabric
deformation. Moreover, inter-subject and inter-terrain variability, coupled
with limited calibration data in real-world deployments, further complicate
accurate estimation. To address these challenges, the proposed framework
integrates MAML into a deep learning architecture to learn a generalizable
model initialization that captures subject- and terrain-invariant structure.
This initialization enables efficient adaptation (i.e., adaptation with only a
small amount of calibration data and a few fine-tuning steps) to new users,
while maintaining strong generalization (i.e., high estimation accuracy across
subjects and terrains). Experiments on nine participants walking at various
speeds over five terrain conditions demonstrate that the proposed framework
outperforms baseline approaches in estimating gait phase, locomotion mode, and
incline angle, with superior accuracy, adaptation efficiency, and
generalization.

Abstract: Indoor air quality plays an essential role in the safety and well-being of
occupants, especially in the context of airborne diseases. This paper
introduces AeroSafe, a novel approach aimed at enhancing the efficacy of indoor
air purification systems through a robotic cough emulator testbed and a
digital-twins-based aerosol residence time analysis. Current portable air
filters often overlook the concentrations of respiratory aerosols generated by
coughs, posing a risk, particularly in high-exposure environments like
healthcare facilities and public spaces. To address this gap, we present a
robotic dual-agent physical emulator comprising a maneuverable mannequin
simulating cough events and a portable air purifier autonomously responding to
aerosols. The generated data from this emulator trains a digital twins model,
combining a physics-based compartment model with a machine learning approach,
using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and graph convolution layers.
Experimental results demonstrate the model's ability to predict aerosol
concentration dynamics with a mean residence time prediction error within 35
seconds. The proposed system's real-time intervention strategies outperform
static air filter placement, showcasing its potential in mitigating airborne
pathogen risks.

Abstract: Microplastics, defined as plastic particles smaller than 5 millimeters, have
become a pervasive environmental contaminant that accumulates on beaches due to
wind patterns and tidal forcing. Detecting microplastics and mapping their
concentration in the wild remains one of the primary challenges in addressing
this environmental issue. This paper introduces a novel robotic platform that
automatically detects and chemically analyzes microplastics on beach surfaces.
This mobile manipulator system scans areas for microplastics using a camera
mounted on the robotic arm's end effector. The system effectively segments
candidate microplastic particles on sand surfaces even in the presence of
organic matter such as leaves and clams. Once a candidate microplastic particle
is detected, the system steers a near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopic sensor onto
the particle using both NIR and visual feedback to chemically analyze it in
real-time. Through experiments in lab and beach environments, the system is
shown to achieve an excellent positional precision in manipulation control and
high microplastic classification accuracy.

Abstract: Contact-rich problems, such as snake robot locomotion, offer unexplored yet
rich opportunities for optimization-based trajectory and acyclic contact
planning. So far, a substantial body of control research has focused on
emulating snake locomotion and replicating its distinctive movement patterns
using shape functions that either ignore the complexity of interactions or
focus on complex interactions with matter (e.g., burrowing movements). However,
models and control frameworks that lie in between these two paradigms and are
based on simple, fundamental rigid body dynamics, which alleviate the
challenging contact and control allocation problems in snake locomotion, remain
absent. This work makes meaningful contributions, substantiated by simulations
and experiments, in the following directions: 1) introducing a reduced-order
model based on Moreau's stepping-forward approach from differential inclusion
mathematics, 2) verifying model accuracy, 3) experimental validation.

Abstract: Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) including large language models
(LLMs) and hybrid reasoning models present an opportunity to reimagine how
autonomous robots such as drones are designed, developed, and validated. Here,
we demonstrate a fully AI-generated drone control system: with minimal human
input, an artificial intelligence (AI) model authored all the code for a
real-time, self-hosted drone command and control platform, which was deployed
and demonstrated on a real drone in flight as well as a simulated virtual drone
in the cloud. The system enables real-time mapping, flight telemetry,
autonomous mission planning and execution, and safety protocolsall orchestrated
through a web interface hosted directly on the drone itself. Not a single line
of code was written by a human. We quantitatively benchmark system performance,
code complexity, and development speed against prior, human-coded
architectures, finding that AI-generated code can deliver functionally complete
command-and-control stacks at orders-of-magnitude faster development cycles,
though with identifiable current limitations related to specific model context
window and reasoning depth. Our analysis uncovers the practical boundaries of
AI-driven robot control code generation at current model scales, as well as
emergent strengths and failure modes in AI-generated robotics code. This work
sets a precedent for the autonomous creation of robot control systems and, more
broadly, suggests a new paradigm for robotics engineeringone in which future

Abstract: Object manipulation skills are necessary for robots operating in various
daily-life scenarios, ranging from warehouses to hospitals. They allow the
robots to manipulate the given object to their desired arrangement in the
cluttered environment. The existing approaches to solving object manipulations
are either inefficient sampling based techniques, require expert
demonstrations, or learn by trial and error, making them less ideal for
practical scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel, multimodal
physics-informed neural network (PINN) for solving object manipulation tasks.
Our approach efficiently learns to solve the Eikonal equation without expert
data and finds object manipulation trajectories fast in complex, cluttered
environments. Our method is multimodal as it also reactively replans the
robot's grasps during manipulation to achieve the desired object poses. We
demonstrate our approach in both simulation and real-world scenarios and
compare it against state-of-the-art baseline methods. The results indicate that
our approach is effective across various objects, has efficient training
compared to previous learning-based methods, and demonstrates high performance
in planning time, trajectory length, and success rates. Our demonstration

Abstract: Human-robot object handover is a crucial element for assistive robots that
aim to help people in their daily lives, including elderly care, hospitals, and
factory floors. The existing approaches to solving these tasks rely on
pre-selected target objects and do not contextualize human implicit and
explicit preferences for handover, limiting natural and smooth interaction
between humans and robots. These preferences can be related to the target
object selection from the cluttered environment and to the way the robot should
grasp the selected object to facilitate desirable human grasping during
handovers. Therefore, this paper presents a unified approach that selects
target distant objects using human verbal and non-verbal commands and performs
the handover operation by contextualizing human implicit and explicit
preferences to generate robot grasps and compliant handover motion sequences.
We evaluate our integrated framework and its components through real-world
experiments and user studies with arbitrary daily-life objects. The results of
these evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed pipeline in
handling object handover tasks by understanding human preferences. Our
demonstration videos can be found at https://youtu.be/6z27B2INl-s.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of aerodynamic forces is essential for advancing the
control, modeling, and design of flapping-wing aerial robots with dynamic
morphing capabilities. In this paper, we investigate two distinct methodologies
for force estimation on Aerobat, a bio-inspired flapping-wing platform designed
to emulate the inertial and aerodynamic behaviors observed in bat flight. Our
goal is to quantify aerodynamic force contributions during tethered flight, a
crucial step toward closed-loop flight control. The first method is a
physics-based observer derived from Hamiltonian mechanics that leverages the
concept of conjugate momentum to infer external aerodynamic forces acting on
the robot. This observer builds on the system's reduced-order dynamic model and
utilizes real-time sensor data to estimate forces without requiring training
data. The second method employs a neural network-based regression model,
specifically a multi-layer perceptron (MLP), to learn a mapping from joint
kinematics, flapping frequency, and environmental parameters to aerodynamic
force outputs. We evaluate both estimators using a 6-axis load cell in a
high-frequency data acquisition setup that enables fine-grained force
measurements during periodic wingbeats. The conjugate momentum observer and the
regression model demonstrate strong agreement across three force components
(Fx, Fy, Fz).

Abstract: Curriculum learning has emerged as a promising approach for training complex
robotics tasks, yet current applications predominantly rely on manually
designed curricula, which demand significant engineering effort and can suffer
from subjective and suboptimal human design choices. While automated curriculum
learning has shown success in simple domains like grid worlds and games where
task distributions can be easily specified, robotics tasks present unique
challenges: they require handling complex task spaces while maintaining
relevance to target domain distributions that are only partially known through
limited samples. To this end, we propose Grounded Adaptive Curriculum Learning,
a framework specifically designed for robotics curriculum learning with three
key innovations: (1) a task representation that consistently handles complex
robot task design, (2) an active performance tracking mechanism that allows
adaptive curriculum generation appropriate for the robot's current

*Chenghao Wang,Alireza Ramezani*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Husky Carbon机器人通过解耦控制架构（Raibert控制器和MPC结合CRD）实现稳定行走和推力辅助，优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统四足机器人因扭矩控制带宽限制而无法统一姿态操纵和推力矢量的问题。

Method: 采用解耦控制架构：Raibert控制器负责腿部运动，MPC结合学习的接触残余动力学（CRD）调节推力。

Result: 实验验证解耦控制架构结合CRD在稳定性和步态表现上优于无CRD的方法。

Conclusion: 解耦控制架构结合CRD能有效提升机器人在复杂环境中的稳定性和适应性。

Abstract: Husky Carbon, a robot developed by Northeastern University, serves as a
research platform to explore unification of posture manipulation and thrust
vectoring. Unlike conventional quadrupeds, its joint actuators and thrusters
enable enhanced control authority, facilitating thruster-assisted narrow-path
walking. While a unified Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework optimizing
both ground reaction forces and thruster forces could theoretically address
this control problem, its feasibility is limited by the low torque-control
bandwidth of the system's lightweight actuators. To overcome this challenge, we
propose a decoupled control architecture: a Raibert-type controller governs
legged locomotion using position-based control, while an MPC regulates the
thrusters augmented by learned Contact Residual Dynamics (CRD) to account for
leg-ground impacts. This separation bypasses the torque-control rate bottleneck
while retaining the thruster MPC to explicitly account for leg-ground impact
dynamics through learned residuals. We validate this approach through both
simulation and hardware experiments, showing that the decoupled control
architecture with CRD performs more stable behavior in terms of push recovery
and cat-like walking gait compared to the decoupled controller without CRD.

TL;DR: LiGen是一种新型室内定位系统，利用环境光的光谱强度模式作为指纹，通过GAN数据增强和MLP模型实现高精度定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Wi-Fi定位系统易受环境影响，LiGen旨在提供更稳定且无需额外基础设施的替代方案。

Method: 设计基于GAN的数据增强框架（PointGAN和FreeGAN），并采用MLP模型训练合成数据。

Result: 系统达到亚米级精度，性能优于Wi-Fi基线50%以上，且在复杂环境中表现稳健。

Conclusion: LiGen首次将光谱指纹与GAN数据增强结合，为室内定位提供了创新解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate and robust indoor localization is critical for smart building
applications, yet existing Wi-Fi-based systems are often vulnerable to
environmental conditions. This work presents a novel indoor localization
system, called LiGen, that leverages the spectral intensity patterns of ambient
light as fingerprints, offering a more stable and infrastructure-free
alternative to radio signals. To address the limited spectral data, we design a
data augmentation framework based on generative adversarial networks (GANs),
featuring two variants: PointGAN, which generates fingerprints conditioned on
coordinates, and FreeGAN, which uses a weak localization model to label
unconditioned samples. Our positioning model, leveraging a Multi-Layer
Perceptron (MLP) architecture to train on synthesized data, achieves
submeter-level accuracy, outperforming Wi-Fi-based baselines by over 50\%.
LiGen also demonstrates strong robustness in cluttered environments. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first system to combine spectral
fingerprints with GAN-based data augmentation for indoor localization.

TL;DR: CogniPlan是一个新的路径规划框架，利用生成模型预测环境布局，结合图注意力路径规划，显著提升了探索和导航性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决移动机器人在未知环境中路径规划的挑战，特别是自主探索和点目标导航任务。

Method: 使用条件生成修复模型预测多个可能的布局，结合图注意力路径规划，利用部分观测地图和布局条件向量进行推理。

Result: 在两个数据集上表现优于现有技术，并在仿真和硬件部署中展示了高质量路径规划和实际应用性。

Conclusion: CogniPlan通过结合生成模型和图注意力规划，显著提升了路径规划性能，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Path planning in unknown environments is a crucial yet inherently challenging
capability for mobile robots, which primarily encompasses two coupled tasks:
autonomous exploration and point-goal navigation. In both cases, the robot must
perceive the environment, update its belief, and accurately estimate potential
information gain on-the-fly to guide planning. In this work, we propose
CogniPlan, a novel path planning framework that leverages multiple plausible
layouts predicted by a COnditional GeNerative Inpainting model, mirroring how
humans rely on cognitive maps during navigation. These predictions, based on
the partially observed map and a set of layout conditioning vectors, enable our
planner to reason effectively under uncertainty. We demonstrate strong synergy
between generative image-based layout prediction and graph-attention-based path
planning, allowing CogniPlan to combine the scalability of graph
representations with the fidelity and predictiveness of occupancy maps,
yielding notable performance gains in both exploration and navigation. We
extensively evaluate CogniPlan on two datasets (hundreds of maps and realistic
floor plans), consistently outperforming state-of-the-art planners. We further
deploy it in a high-fidelity simulator and on hardware, showcasing its
high-quality path planning and real-world applicability.

TL;DR: 通过设计深度学习的鲁棒管模型预测控制器，研究团队在750毫克的扑翼机器人上实现了类似昆虫的高敏捷飞行和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 昆虫飞行具有高敏捷性，而昆虫级飞行机器人受限于硬件和动态不确定性，无法实现类似性能。研究旨在缩小这一差距。

Method: 设计了深度学习的鲁棒管模型预测控制器，并通过模仿学习方法训练神经网络，以实现高反馈速率。

Result: 机器人展示了类似昆虫的急转动作，速度和加速度分别提升了447%和255%，并能在强风和力映射误差下完成高难度动作。

Conclusion: 该研究标志着昆虫级飞行机器人敏捷性的重要进展，为未来传感和计算自主性研究提供了启示。

Abstract: Aerial insects exhibit highly agile maneuvers such as sharp braking,
saccades, and body flips under disturbance. In contrast, insect-scale aerial
robots are limited to tracking non-aggressive trajectories with small body
acceleration. This performance gap is contributed by a combination of low robot
inertia, fast dynamics, uncertainty in flapping-wing aerodynamics, and high
susceptibility to environmental disturbance. Executing highly dynamic maneuvers
requires the generation of aggressive flight trajectories that push against the
hardware limit and a high-rate feedback controller that accounts for model and
environmental uncertainty. Here, through designing a deep-learned robust tube
model predictive controller, we showcase insect-like flight agility and
robustness in a 750-millgram flapping-wing robot. Our model predictive
controller can track aggressive flight trajectories under disturbance. To
achieve a high feedback rate in a compute-constrained real-time system, we
design imitation learning methods to train a two-layer, fully connected neural
network, which resembles insect flight control architecture consisting of
central nervous system and motor neurons. Our robot demonstrates insect-like
saccade movements with lateral speed and acceleration of 197 centimeters per
second and 11.7 meters per second square, representing 447$\%$ and 255$\%$
improvement over prior results. The robot can also perform saccade maneuvers
under 160 centimeters per second wind disturbance and large command-to-force
mapping errors. Furthermore, it performs 10 consecutive body flips in 11
seconds - the most challenging maneuver among sub-gram flyers. These results
represent a milestone in achieving insect-scale flight agility and inspire
future investigations on sensing and compute autonomy.

Result: SkeNavigator显著优于现有方法，SPL提升105%。

Conclusion: SkeNa任务和SkeNavigator框架为视觉导航研究提供新方向，代码和数据集将开源。

Abstract: A typical human strategy for giving navigation guidance is to sketch route
maps based on the environmental layout. Inspired by this, we introduce Sketch
map-based visual Navigation (SkeNa), an embodied navigation task in which an
agent must reach a goal in an unseen environment using only a hand-drawn sketch
map as guidance. To support research for SkeNa, we present a large-scale
dataset named SoR, comprising 54k trajectory and sketch map pairs across 71
indoor scenes. In SoR, we introduce two navigation validation sets with varying
levels of abstraction in hand-drawn sketches, categorized based on their
preservation of spatial scales in the environment, to facilitate future
research. To construct SoR, we develop an automated sketch-generation pipeline
that efficiently converts floor plans into hand-drawn representations. To solve
SkeNa, we propose SkeNavigator, a navigation framework that aligns visual
observations with hand-drawn maps to estimate navigation targets. It employs a
Ray-based Map Descriptor (RMD) to enhance sketch map valid feature
representation using equidistant sampling points and boundary distances. To
improve alignment with visual observations, a Dual-Map Aligned Goal Predictor
(DAGP) leverages the correspondence between sketch map features and on-site
constructed exploration map features to predict goal position and guide
navigation. SkeNavigator outperforms prior floor plan navigation methods by a
large margin, improving SPL on the high-abstract validation set by 105%
relatively. Our code and dataset will be released.

Conclusion: HEAD框架通过模块化设计，实现了从人类数据中高效学习复杂任务的能力，并展示了在真实场景中的适应性。

Abstract: We propose Hand-Eye Autonomous Delivery (HEAD), a framework that learns
navigation, locomotion, and reaching skills for humanoids, directly from human
motion and vision perception data. We take a modular approach where the
high-level planner commands the target position and orientation of the hands
and eyes of the humanoid, delivered by the low-level policy that controls the
whole-body movements. Specifically, the low-level whole-body controller learns
to track the three points (eyes, left hand, and right hand) from existing
large-scale human motion capture data while high-level policy learns from human
data collected by Aria glasses. Our modular approach decouples the ego-centric
vision perception from physical actions, promoting efficient learning and
scalability to novel scenes. We evaluate our method both in simulation and in
the real-world, demonstrating humanoid's capabilities to navigate and reach in
complex environments designed for humans.

Motivation: 探索双足机器人跑步步态的效率优化，并与人类跑步力学进行比较，以实现高速跑步并完成实际任务（如100米短跑）。

Method: 提出了一种优化步态效率的方法，比较了Cassie与人类跑步力学的相似性，并将优化步态集成到控制器中以完成100米短跑任务。

Result: 发现Cassie的步态与人类跑步力学在多个速度范围内高度相似，并成功实现了100米短跑的吉尼斯世界纪录。

Conclusion: 尽管Cassie与人类形态不同，但其优化步态与人类跑步力学相似，且能成功应用于实际任务。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the space of running gaits for the bipedal robot
Cassie. Our first contribution is to present an approach for optimizing gait
efficiency across a spectrum of speeds with the aim of enabling extremely
high-speed running on hardware. This raises the question of how the resulting
gaits compare to human running mechanics, which are known to be highly
efficient in comparison to quadrupeds. Our second contribution is to conduct
this comparison based on established human biomechanical studies. We find that
despite morphological differences between Cassie and humans, key properties of
the gaits are highly similar across a wide range of speeds. Finally, our third
contribution is to integrate the optimized running gaits into a full controller
that satisfies the rules of the real-world task of the 100m dash, including
starting and stopping from a standing position. We demonstrate this controller
on hardware to establish the Guinness World Record for Fastest 100m by a
Bipedal Robot.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用机器人需要根据自然语言描述在未知环境中执行零样本任务，但现有方法在2D图像中难以精确定位3D动作点。

Method: 提出3D相关性场，绕过高维特征，利用轻量级2D点级指导，并通过多视角聚合解决几何模糊和语义不确定性。

Result: 系统能在20秒内生成空间接地的响应，支持实际操控任务。

Conclusion: Point2Act为机器人提供了一种高效且精确的3D动作点定位方法。

Abstract: We propose Point2Act, which directly retrieves the 3D action point relevant
for a contextually described task, leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs). Foundation models opened the possibility for generalist robots that
can perform a zero-shot task following natural language descriptions within an
unseen environment. While the semantics obtained from large-scale image and
language datasets provide contextual understanding in 2D images, the rich yet
nuanced features deduce blurry 2D regions and struggle to find precise 3D
locations for actions. Our proposed 3D relevancy fields bypass the
high-dimensional features and instead efficiently imbue lightweight 2D
point-level guidance tailored to the task-specific action. The multi-view
aggregation effectively compensates for misalignments due to geometric
ambiguities, such as occlusion, or semantic uncertainties inherent in the
language descriptions. The output region is highly localized, reasoning
fine-grained 3D spatial context that can directly transfer to an explicit
position for physical action at the on-the-fly reconstruction of the scene. Our
full-stack pipeline, which includes capturing, MLLM querying, 3D
reconstruction, and grasp pose extraction, generates spatially grounded
responses in under 20 seconds, facilitating practical manipulation tasks.

Result: 在四足机器人运动和视觉导航仿真及四旋翼无人机实验中验证了安全性和任务性能的提升。

Conclusion: MPC-SafeGIL将安全性直接融入数据收集，优于依赖分析模型或交互专家的方法。

Abstract: Imitation Learning has provided a promising approach to learning complex
robot behaviors from expert demonstrations. However, learned policies can make
errors that lead to safety violations, which limits their deployment in
safety-critical applications. We propose MPC-SafeGIL, a design-time approach
that enhances the safety of imitation learning by injecting adversarial
disturbances during expert demonstrations. This exposes the expert to a broader
range of safety-critical scenarios and allows the imitation policy to learn
robust recovery behaviors. Our method uses sampling-based Model Predictive
Control (MPC) to approximate worst-case disturbances, making it scalable to
high-dimensional and black-box dynamical systems. In contrast to prior work
that relies on analytical models or interactive experts, MPC-SafeGIL integrates
safety considerations directly into data collection. We validate our approach
through extensive simulations including quadruped locomotion and visuomotor
navigation and real-world experiments on a quadrotor, demonstrating
improvements in both safety and task performance. See our website here:

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉语言模型（VLM）的零样本语言成本映射框架，用于机器人主动预测动态风险并规划导航路径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统导航系统依赖静态地图，难以应对动态风险（如突然出现的行人），导致反应式而非主动式避障。

Method: 利用预训练的VLM解析视觉场景，评估潜在动态风险，并生成风险感知的导航成本图，结合几何障碍图进行路径规划。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在模拟和动态环境中显著提高了导航成功率并减少了危险遭遇。

Conclusion: 该框架通过语言模型实现了对动态风险的主动预测，为机器人导航提供了更安全的解决方案。

Abstract: Robots operating in human-centric or hazardous environments must proactively
anticipate and mitigate dangers beyond basic obstacle detection. Traditional
navigation systems often depend on static maps, which struggle to account for
dynamic risks, such as a person emerging from a suddenly opening door. As a
result, these systems tend to be reactive rather than anticipatory when
handling dynamic hazards. Recent advancements in pre-trained large language
models and vision-language models (VLMs) create new opportunities for proactive
hazard avoidance. In this work, we propose a zero-shot language-as-cost mapping
framework that leverages VLMs to interpret visual scenes, assess potential
dynamic risks, and assign risk-aware navigation costs preemptively, enabling
robots to anticipate hazards before they materialize. By integrating this
language-based cost map with a geometric obstacle map, the robot not only
identifies existing obstacles but also anticipates and proactively plans around
potential hazards arising from environmental dynamics. Experiments in simulated
and diverse dynamic environments demonstrate that the proposed method
significantly improves navigation success rates and reduces hazard encounters,
compared to reactive baseline planners. Code and supplementary materials are

Result: 揭示了当前大型语言模型和视觉语言模型在复杂长期任务中的主要不足。

Conclusion: CookBench将开源，以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Embodied Planning is dedicated to the goal of creating agents capable of
executing long-horizon tasks in complex physical worlds. However, existing
embodied planning benchmarks frequently feature short-horizon tasks and
coarse-grained action primitives. To address this challenge, we introduce
CookBench, a benchmark for long-horizon planning in complex cooking scenarios.
By leveraging a high-fidelity simulation environment built upon the powerful
Unity game engine, we define frontier AI challenges in a complex, realistic
environment. The core task in CookBench is designed as a two-stage process.
First, in Intention Recognition, an agent needs to accurately parse a user's
complex intent. Second, in Embodied Interaction, the agent should execute the
identified cooking goal through a long-horizon, fine-grained sequence of
physical actions. Unlike existing embodied planning benchmarks, we refine the
action granularity to a spatial level that considers crucial operational
information while abstracting away low-level robotic control. Besides, We
provide a comprehensive toolset that encapsulates the simulator. Its unified
API supports both macro-level operations, such as placing orders and purchasing
ingredients, and a rich set of fine-grained embodied actions for physical
interaction, enabling researchers to focus on high-level planning and
decision-making. Furthermore, we present an in-depth analysis of
state-of-the-art, closed-source Large Language Model and Vision-Language Model,
revealing their major shortcomings and challenges posed by complex,
long-horizon tasks. The full benchmark will be open-sourced to facilitate
future research.

Result: 实验表明，系统能适应用户力指令，同时在复杂环境中保障用户和机器人的安全。

Conclusion: FC-MPC和CBFs的结合有效实现了导盲机器人的力顺应导航和障碍物避障。

Abstract: Guiding the visually impaired in complex environments requires real-time
two-way interaction and safety assurance. We propose a Force-Compliance Model
Predictive Control (FC-MPC) and Robot-User Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) for
force-compliant navigation and obstacle avoidance in Hexapod guide robots.
FC-MPC enables two-way interaction by estimating user-applied forces and
moments using the robot's dynamic model and the recursive least squares (RLS)
method, and then adjusting the robot's movements accordingly, while Robot-User
CBFs ensure the safety of both the user and the robot by handling static and
dynamic obstacles, and employ weighted slack variables to overcome feasibility
issues in complex dynamic environments. We also adopt an Eight-Way Connected
DBSCAN method for obstacle clustering, reducing computational complexity from
O(n2) to approximately O(n), enabling real-time local perception on
resource-limited on-board robot computers. Obstacles are modeled using Minimum
Bounding Ellipses (MBEs), and their trajectories are predicted through Kalman
filtering. Implemented on the HexGuide robot, the system seamlessly integrates
force compliance, autonomous navigation, and obstacle avoidance. Experimental
results demonstrate the system's ability to adapt to user force commands while
guaranteeing user and robot safety simultaneously during navigation in complex
environments.

Abstract: Dexterous grasp datasets are vital for embodied intelligence, but mostly
emphasize grasp stability, ignoring functional grasps needed for tasks like
opening bottle caps or holding cup handles. Most rely on bulky, costly, and
hard-to-control high-DOF Shadow Hands. Inspired by the human hand's
underactuated mechanism, we establish UniFucGrasp, a universal functional grasp
annotation strategy and dataset for multiple dexterous hand types. Based on
biomimicry, it maps natural human motions to diverse hand structures and uses
geometry-based force closure to ensure functional, stable, human-like grasps.
This method supports low-cost, efficient collection of diverse, high-quality
functional grasps. Finally, we establish the first multi-hand functional grasp
dataset and provide a synthesis model to validate its effectiveness.
Experiments on the UFG dataset, IsaacSim, and complex robotic tasks show that
our method improves functional manipulation accuracy and grasp stability,
enables efficient generalization across diverse robotic hands, and overcomes
annotation cost and generalization challenges in dexterous grasping. The

Result: 实验验证了该方法在不同浑浊度下的有效性，并在码头环境中进行了实地测试。

Abstract: Scene reconstruction is an essential capability for underwater robots
navigating in close proximity to structures. Monocular vision-based
reconstruction methods are unreliable in turbid waters and lack depth scale
information. Sonars are robust to turbid water and non-uniform lighting
conditions, however, they have low resolution and elevation ambiguity. This
work proposes a real-time opti-acoustic scene reconstruction method that is
specially optimized to work in turbid water. Our strategy avoids having to
identify point features in visual data and instead identifies regions of
interest in the data. We then match relevant regions in the image to
corresponding sonar data. A reconstruction is obtained by leveraging range data
from the sonar and elevation data from the camera image. Experimental
comparisons against other vision-based and sonar-based approaches at varying
turbidity levels, and field tests conducted in marina environments, validate
the effectiveness of the proposed approach. We have made our code open-source
to facilitate reproducibility and encourage community engagement.

Result: 在仿真和硬件实验中，相比三种先进方法，成功率提升30%，且计算成本相近，生成高质量解。

Conclusion: 该方法在保证实时性能的同时，显著提升了安全性和成功率，适用于复杂环境下的路径规划。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a hybrid MPC local planner that uses a
learning-based approximation of a time-varying safe set, derived from local
observations and applied as the MPC terminal constraint. This set can be
represented as a zero-superlevel set of the value function computed via
Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis, which is infeasible in real-time.
We exploit the property that the HJ value function can be expressed as a
difference of the corresponding signed distance function (SDF) and a
non-negative residual function. The residual component is modeled as a neural
network with non-negative output and subtracted from the computed SDF,
resulting in a real-time value function estimate that is at least as safe as
the SDF by design. Additionally, we parametrize the neural residual by a
hypernetwork to improve real-time performance and generalization properties.
The proposed method is compared with three state-of-the-art methods in
simulations and hardware experiments, achieving up to 30\% higher success rates
compared to the best baseline while requiring a similar computational effort

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于导演指导的框架，通过戏剧方法生成机器人情感表达行为，并构建可重用的动作模板库。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何利用戏剧方法开发具有艺术表现力的机器人行为，促进人机交互的跨学科合作。

Method: 采用导演指导的木偶工作流程，通过叙事目标生成即兴机器人动作，并收集整理为可重用的动作模板。

Result: 初步试验验证了该方法的可行性，能够精确塑造机器人动作的情感表达，但也揭示了机械限制带来的挑战。

Conclusion: 该框架为跨学科团队开发社交表达机器人行为提供了模型，同时推动了戏剧作为人机交互训练场和人与机器共创方法的发展。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose theatre-in-the-loop, a framework for developing
expressive robot behaviours tailored to artistic performance through a
director-guided puppeteering workflow. Leveraging theatrical methods, we use
narrative objectives to direct a puppeteer in generating improvised robotic
gestures that convey specific emotions. These improvisations are captured and
curated to build a dataset of reusable movement templates for standalone
playback in future autonomous performances. Initial trials demonstrate the
feasibility of this approach, illustrating how the workflow enables precise
sculpting of robotic gestures into coherent emotional arcs while revealing
challenges posed by the robot's mechanical constraints. We argue that this
practice-led framework provides a model for interdisciplinary teams creating
socially expressive robot behaviours, contributing to (1) theatre as an
interactive training ground for human-robot interaction and (2) co-creation
methodologies between humans and machines.

TL;DR: 提出CollaBot框架，用于多机器人协作操纵大型物体，通过场景分割、协作抓取和两阶段规划实现任务，实验成功率为52%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器人操纵任务主要针对小物体，但工厂或家庭环境中常需移动大型物体，需多机器人协作，现有研究缺乏通用框架。

Method: 使用SEEM进行场景分割和点云提取，提出协作抓取框架（局部抓取位姿生成和全局协作），设计两阶段规划模块生成无碰撞轨迹。

Result: 实验在不同机器人数量、物体和任务中达到52%的成功率。

Conclusion: CollaBot框架在多机器人协作操纵任务中表现出有效性。

Abstract: A central research topic in robotics is how to use this system to interact
with the physical world. Traditional manipulation tasks primarily focus on
small objects. However, in factory or home environments, there is often a need
for the movement of large objects, such as moving tables. These tasks typically
require multi-robot systems to work collaboratively. Previous research lacks a
framework that can scale to arbitrary sizes of robots and generalize to various
kinds of tasks. In this work, we propose CollaBot, a generalist framework for
simultaneous collaborative manipulation. First, we use SEEM for scene
segmentation and point cloud extraction of the target object. Then, we propose
a collaborative grasping framework, which decomposes the task into local grasp
pose generation and global collaboration. Finally, we design a 2-stage planning
module that can generate collision-free trajectories to achieve this task.
Experiments show a success rate of 52% across different numbers of robots,
objects, and tasks, indicating the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Abstract: The integration of Automated Delivery Robots (ADRs) into pedestrian-heavy
urban spaces introduces unique challenges in terms of safe, efficient, and
socially acceptable navigation. We develop the complete pipeline for a single
vision sensor based multi-pedestrian detection and tracking, pose estimation,
and monocular depth perception. Leveraging the real-world MOT17 dataset
sequences, this study demonstrates how integrating human-pose estimation and
depth cues enhances pedestrian trajectory prediction and identity maintenance,
even under occlusions and dense crowds. Results show measurable improvements,
including up to a 10% increase in identity preservation (IDF1), a 7%
improvement in multiobject tracking accuracy (MOTA), and consistently high
detection precision exceeding 85%, even in challenging scenarios. Notably, the
system identifies vulnerable pedestrian groups supporting more socially aware

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 协作机器人在复杂环境（如建筑工地）中工作时，振动抑制是关键能力。研究旨在通过在线学习和前馈力控制抑制外部振动源（如电动工具）引起的振动。

Method: 采用带限多傅里叶线性组合器（BMFLC）算法在线学习振动，并提出阻尼BMFLC方法，结合自适应步长和基于逻辑函数的阻尼机制，以提高收敛速度和抗噪性。

Result: 仿真和实际实验表明，阻尼BMFLC在抑制率和效率上优于原始BMFLC及其递归最小二乘和卡尔曼滤波扩展方法。

Conclusion: 阻尼BMFLC方法在振动抑制中表现出更高的性能和效率，适用于实际协作机器人任务。

Abstract: Vibration suppression is an important capability for collaborative robots
deployed in challenging environments such as construction sites. We study the
active suppression of vibration caused by external sources such as power tools.
We adopt the band-limited multiple Fourier linear combiner (BMFLC) algorithm to
learn the vibration online and counter it by feedforward force control. We
propose the damped BMFLC method, extending BMFLC with a novel adaptive
step-size approach that improves the convergence time and noise resistance. Our
logistic function-based damping mechanism reduces the effect of noise and
enables larger learning rates. We evaluate our method on extensive simulation
experiments with realistic time-varying multi-frequency vibration and
real-world physical interaction experiments. The simulation experiments show
that our method improves the suppression rate in comparison to the original
BMFLC and its recursive least squares and Kalman filter-based extensions.
Furthermore, our method is far more efficient than the latter two. We further
validate the effectiveness of our method in real-world polishing experiments. A

Abstract: Imagine a robot controller with the ability to adapt like human synapses,
dynamically rewiring itself to overcome unforeseen challenges in real time.
This paper proposes a novel zero-shot adaptation mechanism for evolutionary
robotics, merging a standard Genetic Algorithm (GA) controller with online
Hebbian plasticity. Inspired by biological systems, the method separates
learning and memory, with the genotype acting as memory and Hebbian updates
handling learning. In our approach, the fitness function is leveraged as a live
scaling factor for Hebbian learning, enabling the robot's neural controller to
adjust synaptic weights on-the-fly without additional training. This adds a
dynamic adaptive layer that activates only during runtime to handle unexpected
environmental changes. After the task, the robot 'forgets' the temporary
adjustments and reverts to the original weights, preserving core knowledge. We
validate this hybrid GA-Hebbian controller on an e-puck robot in a T-maze
navigation task with changing light conditions and obstacles.

Motivation: 扩散策略的强化学习微调存在样本效率低和环境交互依赖强的问题。

Method: 提出DiWA框架，利用离线世界模型进行扩散策略的微调，减少环境交互需求。

Result: 在CALVIN基准测试中，DiWA仅通过离线适应提升了八项任务的性能，样本效率显著优于基线。

Conclusion: DiWA首次实现了基于离线世界模型的扩散策略微调，为机器人技能学习提供了更实用和安全的方法。

Abstract: Fine-tuning diffusion policies with reinforcement learning (RL) presents
significant challenges. The long denoising sequence for each action prediction
impedes effective reward propagation. Moreover, standard RL methods require
millions of real-world interactions, posing a major bottleneck for practical
fine-tuning. Although prior work frames the denoising process in diffusion
policies as a Markov Decision Process to enable RL-based updates, its strong
dependence on environment interaction remains highly inefficient. To bridge
this gap, we introduce DiWA, a novel framework that leverages a world model for
fine-tuning diffusion-based robotic skills entirely offline with reinforcement
learning. Unlike model-free approaches that require millions of environment
interactions to fine-tune a repertoire of robot skills, DiWA achieves effective
adaptation using a world model trained once on a few hundred thousand offline
play interactions. This results in dramatically improved sample efficiency,
making the approach significantly more practical and safer for real-world robot
learning. On the challenging CALVIN benchmark, DiWA improves performance across
eight tasks using only offline adaptation, while requiring orders of magnitude
fewer physical interactions than model-free baselines. To our knowledge, this
is the first demonstration of fine-tuning diffusion policies for real-world
robotic skills using an offline world model. We make the code publicly
available at https://diwa.cs.uni-freiburg.de.

Motivation: 现有内河水道图表（IENC）缺乏实时细节，传统LiDAR SLAM在水道环境中效果不佳，导致垂直漂移和非语义地图，阻碍自主导航。

Method: 改进特征提取，引入水面平面约束，通过体素几何分析将3D点云转化为结构化2D语义地图，并自动化提取岸线。

Result: 在真实数据集上，Inland-LOAM的定位精度优于现有方法，生成的语义地图和岸线与实际情况一致。

Conclusion: Inland-LOAM为内河水道自主导航提供了可靠的地理空间信息，代码和数据集将公开。

Abstract: Accurate geospatial information is crucial for safe, autonomous Inland
Waterway Transport (IWT), as existing charts (IENC) lack real-time detail and
conventional LiDAR SLAM fails in waterway environments. These challenges lead
to vertical drift and non-semantic maps, hindering autonomous navigation.
  This paper introduces Inland-LOAM, a LiDAR SLAM framework for waterways. It
uses an improved feature extraction and a water surface planar constraint to
mitigate vertical drift. A novel pipeline transforms 3D point clouds into
structured 2D semantic maps using voxel-based geometric analysis, enabling
real-time computation of navigational parameters like bridge clearances. An
automated module extracts shorelines and exports them into a lightweight,
IENC-compatible format.
  Evaluations on a real-world dataset show Inland-LOAM achieves superior
localization accuracy over state-of-the-art methods. The generated semantic
maps and shorelines align with real-world conditions, providing reliable data
for enhanced situational awareness. The code and dataset will be publicly
available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了实现更自然的用户体验，需要区分用户对语音助手的查询与背景语音或侧边对话。

Method: 采用自适应知识蒸馏方法，从预训练的大规模声学编码器（教师模型）中提取通用表征，并通过任务特定的适配器与学生模型联合训练。

Result: 在关键词和非关键词（后续）调用中，该方法比未使用蒸馏的学生模型分别提高了26%和19%的等错误率。

Conclusion: 该方法在基于Transformer和Conformer的模型架构中均表现出良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Device-directed speech detection (DDSD) is a binary classification task that
separates the user's queries to a voice assistant (VA) from background speech
or side conversations. This is important for achieving naturalistic user
experience. To this end, we propose knowledge distillation (KD) to enhance DDSD
accuracy while ensuring efficient deployment. Specifically, we introduce a
novel adaptive KD method that transfers knowledge from general representations
of an ASR large pre-trained acoustic encoder (teacher). We apply task-specific
adapters, on top of the (frozen) teacher encoder, trained jointly with the
student model on DDSD. We demonstrate that the proposed adaptive KD outperforms
the student model without distillation in the keyword and keyword-free
(follow-up) invocations, with an improvement of +26% and +19% in terms of Equal
Error Rate, respectively. We also show that this approach generalizes across
the transformer and conformer-based model architectures.

Result: 噪声功率掩码和概率阈值模型表现最佳，用户偏好优化后的输出。

Conclusion: 人类反馈迭代优化是提升神经语音提取性能的有效方法。

Abstract: We present the first neural target speech extraction (TSE) system that uses
human feedback for iterative refinement. Our approach allows users to mark
specific segments of the TSE output, generating an edit mask. The refinement
system then improves the marked sections while preserving unmarked regions.
Since large-scale datasets of human-marked errors are difficult to collect, we
generate synthetic datasets using various automated masking functions and train
models on each. Evaluations show that models trained with noise power-based
masking (in dBFS) and probabilistic thresholding perform best, aligning with
human annotations. In a study with 22 participants, users showed a preference
for refined outputs over baseline TSE. Our findings demonstrate that
human-in-the-loop refinement is a promising approach for improving the
performance of neural speech extraction.

Conclusion: TF-MLPNet为可穿戴设备提供了高效的实时语音分离解决方案。

Abstract: Speech separation on hearable devices can enable transformative augmented and
enhanced hearing capabilities. However, state-of-the-art speech separation
networks cannot run in real-time on tiny, low-power neural accelerators
designed for hearables, due to their limited compute capabilities. We present
TF-MLPNet, the first speech separation network capable of running in real-time
on such low-power accelerators while outperforming existing streaming models
for blind speech separation and target speech extraction. Our network operates
in the time-frequency domain, processing frequency sequences with stacks of
fully connected layers that alternate along the channel and frequency
dimensions, and independently processing the time sequence at each frequency
bin using convolutional layers. Results show that our mixed-precision
quantization-aware trained (QAT) model can process 6 ms audio chunks in
real-time on the GAP9 processor, achieving a 3.5-4x runtime reduction compared
to prior speech separation models.

Conclusion: DLPO为实时、资源受限场景下的高质量扩散TTS提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models produce high-fidelity speech but are inefficient for
real-time use due to long denoising steps and challenges in modeling intonation
and rhythm. To improve this, we propose Diffusion Loss-Guided Policy
Optimization (DLPO), an RLHF framework for TTS diffusion models. DLPO
integrates the original training loss into the reward function, preserving
generative capabilities while reducing inefficiencies. Using naturalness scores
as feedback, DLPO aligns reward optimization with the diffusion model's
structure, improving speech quality. We evaluate DLPO on WaveGrad 2, a
non-autoregressive diffusion-based TTS model. Results show significant
improvements in objective metrics (UTMOS 3.65, NISQA 4.02) and subjective
evaluations, with DLPO audio preferred 67\% of the time. These findings
demonstrate DLPO's potential for efficient, high-quality diffusion TTS in
real-time, resource-limited settings.

A Transformer-based decoder for prosody-aware spectrogram prediction, and 3) A

Conclusion: WhisperInject揭示了一种实用且隐蔽的音频攻击方法，超越了理论漏洞，展示了实际威胁。

Abstract: As large language models become increasingly integrated into daily life,
audio has emerged as a key interface for human-AI interaction. However, this
convenience also introduces new vulnerabilities, making audio a potential
attack surface for adversaries. Our research introduces WhisperInject, a
two-stage adversarial audio attack framework that can manipulate
state-of-the-art audio language models to generate harmful content. Our method
uses imperceptible perturbations in audio inputs that remain benign to human
listeners. The first stage uses a novel reward-based optimization method,
Reinforcement Learning with Projected Gradient Descent (RL-PGD), to guide the
target model to circumvent its own safety protocols and generate harmful native
responses. This native harmful response then serves as the target for Stage 2,
Payload Injection, where we use Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) to optimize
subtle perturbations that are embedded into benign audio carriers, such as
weather queries or greeting messages. Validated under the rigorous
StrongREJECT, LlamaGuard, as well as Human Evaluation safety evaluation
framework, our experiments demonstrate a success rate exceeding 86% across
Qwen2.5-Omni-3B, Qwen2.5-Omni-7B, and Phi-4-Multimodal. Our work demonstrates a
new class of practical, audio-native threats, moving beyond theoretical
exploits to reveal a feasible and covert method for manipulating AI behavior.

Motivation: 解决非专业环境中音乐录音常见的音频质量问题（如混响、失真等），避免使用多个工具和手动调整。

Method: 基于自然语言指令的生成模型，通过流匹配训练范式学习音频转换，使用模拟退化的数据集进行训练。

Result: SonicMaster在所有音频问题类别中显著提升音质，主观测试显示用户偏好其输出。

Conclusion: SonicMaster提供了一种有效的统一方法，用于音乐修复和母带处理。

Abstract: Music recordings often suffer from audio quality issues such as excessive
reverberation, distortion, clipping, tonal imbalances, and a narrowed stereo
image, especially when created in non-professional settings without specialized
equipment or expertise. These problems are typically corrected using separate
specialized tools and manual adjustments. In this paper, we introduce
SonicMaster, the first unified generative model for music restoration and
mastering that addresses a broad spectrum of audio artifacts with text-based
control. SonicMaster is conditioned on natural language instructions to apply
targeted enhancements, or can operate in an automatic mode for general
restoration. To train this model, we construct the SonicMaster dataset, a large
dataset of paired degraded and high-quality tracks by simulating common
degradation types with nineteen degradation functions belonging to five
enhancements groups: equalization, dynamics, reverb, amplitude, and stereo. Our
approach leverages a flow-matching generative training paradigm to learn an
audio transformation that maps degraded inputs to their cleaned, mastered
versions guided by text prompts. Objective audio quality metrics demonstrate
that SonicMaster significantly improves sound quality across all artifact
categories. Furthermore, subjective listening tests confirm that listeners
prefer SonicMaster's enhanced outputs over the original degraded audio,
highlighting the effectiveness of our unified approach.

TL;DR: EmoSteer-TTS提出了一种无需训练的方法，通过激活引导实现细粒度的语音情感控制（转换、插值、擦除），优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TTS系统的情感控制通常粗糙且依赖离散标签或详细文本提示，且需要大量高质量数据集训练。EmoSteer-TTS旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 通过修改流匹配TTS模型的内部激活子集来改变情感，开发了无需训练的算法（激活提取、情感标记搜索、推理时引导），适用于多种预训练模型。

Result: 实验表明，EmoSteer-TTS实现了细粒度、可解释且连续的情感控制，优于现有技术。

Conclusion: EmoSteer-TTS是首个实现无需训练且连续细粒度情感控制的TTS方法。

Abstract: Text-to-speech (TTS) has shown great progress in recent years. However, most
existing TTS systems offer only coarse and rigid emotion control, typically via
discrete emotion labels or a carefully crafted and detailed emotional text
prompt, making fine-grained emotion manipulation either inaccessible or
unstable. These models also require extensive, high-quality datasets for
training. To address these limitations, we propose EmoSteer-TTS, a novel
training-free approach, to achieve fine-grained speech emotion control
(conversion, interpolation, erasure) by activation steering. We first
empirically observe that modifying a subset of the internal activations within
a flow matching-based TTS model can effectively alter the emotional tone of
synthesized speech. Building on this insight, we then develop a training-free
and efficient algorithm, including activation extraction, emotional token
searching, and inference-time steering, which can be seamlessly integrated into
a wide range of pretrained models (e.g., F5-TTS, CosyVoice2, and E2-TTS). In
addition, to derive effective steering vectors, we construct a curated
emotional speech dataset with diverse speakers. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that EmoSteer-TTS enables fine-grained, interpretable, and
continuous control over speech emotion, outperforming the state-of-the-art
(SOTA). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method that achieves
training-free and continuous fine-grained emotion control in TTS.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为MaLV-OS的ML专用操作系统，通过重新设计OS架构以优化ML工作负载，特别是在虚拟化云环境中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多利用ML优化内核决策，但缺乏利用OS优化ML性能的研究。本文填补了这一空白。

Method: MaLV-OS采用微内核架构（Micro-LAKE）和MLaaS子系统，将系统敏感部分卸载到OS，并集成GPU虚拟化软件。

Result: MaLV-OS通过动态选择MLaaS策略和模块化设计，提升了ML模型的性能和灵活性。

Conclusion: MaLV-OS为ML工作负载提供了专用OS支持，显著优化了性能和执行效率。

Abstract: A large body of research has employed Machine Learning (ML) models to develop
learned operating systems (OSes) and kernels. The latter dynamically adapts to
the job load and dynamically adjusts resources (CPU, IO, memory, network
bandwidth) allocation to respond to the actual user demand. What this work has
in common is that it utilizes ML to improve kernel decisions. To this day, and
to the best of our knowledge, no work has taken the opposite direction, i.e.,
using OS to improve ML. While some work proposes applying system-level
optimizations to ML algorithms, they do not tailor the OS to adapt to the ML
context. To address this limitation, we take an orthogonal approach in this
paper by leveraging the OS to enhance the performance of ML models and
algorithms. We explore the path towards an ML-specialized OS, MaLV-OS. MaLV-OS
rethinks the OS architecture to make it specifically tailored to ML workloads,
especially in virtualized clouds, which are now widely used to run ML
applications. MaLV-OS envisioned architecture includes (1) a micro-kernel,
Micro-LAKE, which allows kernel space applications to use the GPU, and (2) an
MLaaS (ML as a Service) subsystem that gathers ML models to help Micro-LAKE
with memory management and CPU scheduling. MaLV-OS architecture also offloads
system-sensitive parts of the models to the OS, to lighten the model complexity
and programming, and speed up its execution. Finally, MaLV-OS integrates an
open-source GPU virtualization software, merged directly into the hypervisor.
For more flexibility, MaLV-OS vision is to enable the virtual machine to
dynamically select MLaaS policies that can improve the performance of the model
the user is running. Because MLaaS is designed as loadable kernel modules, the
MaLV-OS architecture enables the dynamic addition of new capabilities to the
MLaaS subsystem.

Method: 提出30种基于多层感知器的量子神经网络变体，涵盖三种架构和十种量子电路配置，并与经典神经网络在准确率和训练时间上进行比较。

Result: 量子模型在一个未见数据集上准确率提高约20%，但在其他数据集上表现较差；训练时间显著短于经典模型。

Conclusion: 量子神经网络在蛋白质结合能预测中展现出潜力，尤其在训练效率方面具有优势，但需进一步优化以提高泛化能力。

Abstract: Binding energy is a fundamental thermodynamic property that governs molecular
interactions, playing a crucial role in fields such as healthcare and the
natural sciences. It is particularly relevant in drug development, vaccine
design, and other biomedical applications. Over the years, various methods have
been developed to estimate protein binding energy, ranging from experimental
techniques to computational approaches, with machine learning making
significant contributions to this field. Although classical computing has
demonstrated strong results in constructing predictive models, the variation of
quantum computing for machine learning has emerged as a promising alternative.
Quantum neural networks (QNNs) have gained traction as a research focus,
raising the question of their potential advantages in predicting binding
energies. To investigate this potential, this study explored the feasibility of
QNNs for this task by proposing thirty variations of multilayer
perceptron-based quantum neural networks. These variations span three distinct
architectures, each incorporating ten different quantum circuits to configure
their quantum layers. The performance of these quantum models was compared with
that of a state-of-the-art classical multilayer perceptron-based artificial
neural network, evaluating both accuracy and training time. A primary dataset
was used for training, while two additional datasets containing entirely unseen
samples were employed for testing. Results indicate that the quantum models
achieved approximately 20% higher accuracy on one unseen dataset, although
their accuracy was lower on the other datasets. Notably, quantum models
exhibited training times several orders of magnitude shorter than their
classical counterparts, highlighting their potential for efficient protein
binding energy prediction.

TL;DR: 本文综述了三种AI代理注册系统方法（MCP、A2A、NANDA），比较了它们在安全性、可扩展性、认证和维护性方面的差异，并提出了未来设计的建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI代理在云、企业和去中心化环境中的普及，标准化注册系统对发现、身份和能力共享变得至关重要。

Method: 分析了三种注册方法：MCP的mcp.json（集中式元注册）、A2A的Agent Card（基于JSON的去中心化交互）和NANDA的AgentFacts（可验证的隐私保护元数据模型）。

Result: 比较了三种方法在安全性、可扩展性、认证和维护性四个维度的表现。

Conclusion: 提出了未来AI代理注册系统设计和采用的建议，以促进跨域互操作性。

Abstract: As As autonomous AI agents scale across cloud, enterprise, and decentralized
environments, the need for standardized registry systems to support discovery,
identity, and capability sharing has become essential. This paper surveys three
prominent registry approaches each defined by a unique metadata model: MCP's
mcp.json, A2A's Agent Card, and NANDA's AgentFacts. MCP uses a centralized
metaregistry with GitHub authenticated publishing and structured metadata for
server discovery. A2A enables decentralized interaction via JSON-based Agent
Cards, discoverable through well-known URIs, curated catalogs, or direct
configuration. NANDA Index introduces AgentFacts, a cryptographically
verifiable and privacy-preserving metadata model designed for dynamic
discovery, credentialed capabilities, and cross-domain interoperability. These
approaches are compared across four dimensions: security, scalability,
authentication, and maintainability. The paper concludes with suggestions and
recommendations to guide future design and adoption of registry systems for the
Internet of AI Agents.

TL;DR: 论文提出了NANDA框架，用于构建安全、可信且互操作的AI代理生态系统，解决异构协议环境下的发现、认证和协作问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI代理的快速发展需要新的基础设施来支持安全、可信和跨协议的协作，填补现有能力与需求之间的关键空白。

Method: 提出NANDA框架，包括全局代理发现、加密能力验证（AgentFacts）、跨协议互操作性，并采用零信任代理访问（ZTAA）原则。

Result: NANDA实现了代理可见性和控制（AVC）机制，支持企业治理，同时保持操作自主性和合规性，为大规模AI代理部署奠定基础。

Conclusion: NANDA框架为下一代自主智能系统提供了关键基础设施，解决了异构环境中AI代理的安全与协作问题。

Abstract: The proliferation of autonomous AI agents represents a paradigmatic shift
from traditional web architectures toward collaborative intelligent systems
requiring sophisticated mechanisms for discovery, authentication, capability
verification, and secure collaboration across heterogeneous protocol
environments. This paper presents a comprehensive framework addressing the
fundamental infrastructure requirements for secure, trustworthy, and
interoperable AI agent ecosystems. We introduce the NANDA (Networked AI Agents
in a Decentralized Architecture) framework, providing global agent discovery,
cryptographically verifiable capability attestation through AgentFacts, and
cross-protocol interoperability across Anthropic's Modal Context Protocol
(MCP), Google's Agent-to-Agent (A2A), Microsoft's NLWeb, and standard HTTPS
communications. NANDA implements Zero Trust Agentic Access (ZTAA) principles,
extending traditional Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) to address autonomous
agent security challenges including capability spoofing, impersonation attacks,
and sensitive data leakage. The framework defines Agent Visibility and Control
(AVC) mechanisms enabling enterprise governance while maintaining operational
autonomy and regulatory compliance. Our approach transforms isolated AI agents
into an interconnected ecosystem of verifiable, trustworthy intelligent
services, establishing foundational infrastructure for large-scale autonomous
agent deployment across enterprise and consumer environments. This work
addresses the critical gap between current AI agent capabilities and
infrastructure requirements for secure, scalable, multi-agent collaboration,
positioning the foundation for next-generation autonomous intelligent systems.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: AdaptiveResolver是一种动态微服务架构，用于解决分布式异构环境中AI代理通信的静态端点解析限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DNS或静态URL无法满足基于地理、负载、能力和安全威胁等动态因素的实时端点选择需求。

Method: 通过Agent Fact卡片在Agent Registry/Index中发布代理名称和上下文需求，请求代理通过注册表发现目标代理，并根据实际环境上下文解析目标代理名称以获取定制通信通道。

Result: 支持信任、服务质量和资源约束的协商，实现灵活、安全和可扩展的代理间交互。

Conclusion: AdaptiveResolver为未来复杂的代理通信提供了稳健的基础。

Abstract: AdaptiveResolver is a dynamic microservice architecture designed to address
the limitations of static endpoint resolution for AI agent communication in
distributed, heterogeneous environments. Unlike traditional DNS or static URLs,
AdaptiveResolver enables context-aware, real-time selection of communication
endpoints based on factors such as geographic location, system load, agent
capabilities, and security threats. Agents advertise their Agent Name and
context requirements through Agent Fact cards in an Agent Registry/Index. A
requesting Agent discovers a Target Agent using the registry. The Requester
Agent can then resolve the Target Agent Name to obtain a tailored communication
channel to the agent based on actual environmental context between the agents.
The architecture supports negotiation of trust, quality of service, and
resource constraints, facilitating flexible, secure, and scalable
agent-to-agent interactions that go beyond the classic client-server model.
AdaptiveResolver provides a foundation for robust, future-proof agent
communication that can evolve with increasing ecosystem complexity.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Morphlux的可编程光子互连技术，用于服务器内加速器芯片之间的光互连，以解决电互连带宽不足导致的资源利用率低问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前商用多加速器服务器使用电互连连接加速器芯片，但加速器计算能力提升速度远超互连带宽，导致资源利用率低和GPU闲置。

Method: 开发了Morphlux，一种服务器规模的可编程光子互连架构，通过光互连提升带宽并减少计算碎片化。

Result: 实验表明，Morphlux可将租户计算分配的带宽提升66%，计算碎片化减少70%，训练吞吐量提升1.72倍，并能在1.2秒内逻辑替换故障加速器芯片。

Conclusion: Morphlux通过光互连技术显著提升了服务器内加速器的互连性能和资源利用率，为ML数据中心提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: We optically interconnect accelerator chips (e.g., GPUs, TPUs) within compute
servers using newly viable programmable chip-to-chip photonic fabrics. In
contrast, today, commercial multi-accelerator compute servers that are
workhorses of ML, use electrical interconnects to network accelerator chips in
the server. However, recent trends have shown an interconnect bandwidth wall
caused by accelerator FLOPS scaling at a faster rate than the bandwidth of the
interconnect between accelerators in the same server. This has led to
under-utilization and idling of GPU resources in cloud datacenters. We develop
Morphlux, a server-scale programmable photonic fabric, to interconnect
accelerators within servers. We show that augmenting state-of-the-art photonic
ML-centric datacenters with Morphlux can improve the bandwidth of tenant
compute allocations by up to 66% and reduce compute fragmentation by up to 70%.
We develop a novel end-to-end hardware prototype of Morphlux to demonstrate
these performance benefits, which translate to 1.72x improvement in training
throughput of ML models. By rapidly programming the server-scale fabric in our
hardware testbed, Morphlux can logically replace a failed accelerator chip in
1.2 seconds.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: SecoustiCodec是一种跨模态对齐的低比特率流式语音编解码器，通过解耦语义和副语言信息，解决了现有编解码器在语义编码中的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音编解码器在语义编码中存在副语言信息残留、语义不完整、重建能力有限及不支持流式等问题，需要一种新方法来解决这些挑战。

Method: 提出基于VAE和FSQ的语义量化方法，采用对比学习解耦语义和副语言信息，并通过多阶段优化策略确保收敛稳定性。

Result: 在0.27/1 kbps下，SecoustiCodec实现了1.77/2.58的PESQ重建质量，达到SOTA水平。

Conclusion: SecoustiCodec通过跨模态对齐和解耦方法，显著提升了语音编解码器的性能，并开源了代码和模型。

Abstract: Speech codecs serve as a crucial bridge in unifying speech and text language
models. Existing codec methods face several challenges in semantic encoding,
such as residual paralinguistic information (e.g., timbre, emotion),
insufficient semantic completeness, limited reconstruction capability, and lack
of support for streaming. To address these challenges, we propose
SecoustiCodec, a cross-modal aligned low-bitrate streaming speech codec that
disentangles semantic and paralinguistic information in a single-codebook
space. To ensure semantic completeness and reconstruction fidelity,
paralinguistic encoding is introduced to bridge the information gap between
semantic and acoustic encoding. A semantic-only efficient quantization method
based on VAE (Variational Autoencoder) and FSQ (Finite Scalar Quantization) is
proposed. This approach alleviates the long-tail distribution problem of tokens
while maintaining high codebook utilization. A semantic disentanglement method
based on contrastive learning is proposed, which aligns text and speech in a
joint multimodal frame-level space, effectively removing paralinguistic
information from semantic encoding. An acoustic-constrained multi-stage
optimization strategy is proposed to ensure robust and stable convergence.
Figure~\ref{fig:pesq_kbps_below_2kbps} shows SecoustiCodec achieves SOTA
(state-of-the-art) reconstruction quality (PESQ) of 1.77/2.58 at 0.27/1 kbps.
The code and model weights for SecoustiCodec will be open-sourced upon the
completion of the peer-review process. We've open-sourced SecoustiCodec's demo,
code, and model weights.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法难以模拟符合物理规律的运动数据，导致语音增强模型在动态场景中训练数据不足。

Method: 分解运动声源的脉冲响应为线性时不变调制和离散时变分数延迟，建立符合物理的运动声场模型，并采用分层采样策略。

Result: 相比开源模型GSound，该理论更准确地还原动态场景中的振幅和相位变化，解决了运动声源数据模拟的行业难题。

Conclusion: 为语音增强模型提供高质量动态训练数据，提升多通道端到端语音跟踪算法的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Modern neural network-based speech processing systems need reverberation
resistance, relying on large amounts of reverberation data for training.
Existing methods simulate dynamic scenarios by sampling static systems or
supplement with measured data, but struggle to simulate motion data conforming
to physical laws. To address insufficient training data for speech enhancement
models in moving scenarios, this paper proposes Yang's motion spatio-temporal
sampling reconstruction theory, enabling efficient simulation of motion-induced
continuous time-varying reverberation. It breaks through the limitations of
traditional static Image-Source Method (ISM) in time-varying systems by
decomposing the moving image source's impulse response into linear
time-invariant modulation and discrete time-varying fractional delay,
establishing a physics-compliant moving sound field model. Based on the
band-limited nature of motion displacement, a hierarchical sampling strategy is
adopted: high sampling rates for low-order images to retain details, and low
rates for high-order ones to reduce complexity, combined with a fast synthesis
architecture for real-time simulation. Experiments show that compared to
open-source model GSound, the theory more accurately restores amplitude and
phase changes in moving scenarios, solving the industry challenge of motion
sound source data simulation. It provides high-quality dynamic training data
for speech enhancement models and improves the robustness of multi-channel
end-to-end voice tracking algorithms.

TL;DR: PatchDSU通过将输入分割为补丁并独立增强每个补丁，解决了语音数据中的分布偏移问题，优于其他方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实语音系统中，训练和测试数据分布不一致，导致模型性能下降。

Method: PatchDSU扩展了DSU方法，将输入分割为补丁并独立增强，适用于语音数据。

Result: 在多个数据集和噪声条件下，PatchDSU和DSU表现优于其他方法，PatchDSU更稳定。

Conclusion: PatchDSU在语音任务中有效解决了分布偏移问题，具有更一致的性能提升。

Abstract: Deep learning models excel at many tasks but rely on the assumption that
training and test data follow the same distribution. This assumption often does
not hold in real-world speech systems, where distribution shifts are common due
to varying environments, recording conditions, and speaker diversity.
  The method of Domain Shifts with Uncertainty (DSU) augments the input of each
neural network layer based on the input feature statistics. It addresses the
problem of out-of-domain generalization by assuming feature statistics follow a
multivariate Gaussian distribution and substitutes the input with sampled
features from this distribution. While effective for computer vision, applying
DSU to speech presents challenges due to the nature of the data. Unlike static
visual data, speech is a temporal signal commonly represented by a spectrogram
- the change of frequency over time. This representation cannot be treated as a
simple image, and the resulting sparsity can lead to skewed feature statistics
when applied to the entire input.
  To tackle out-of-distribution issues in keyword spotting, we propose
PatchDSU, which extends DSU by splitting the input into patches and
independently augmenting each patch. We evaluated PatchDSU and DSU alongside
other methods on the Google Speech Commands, Librispeech, and TED-LIUM.
Additionally, we evaluated performance under white Gaussian and MUSAN music
noise conditions. We also explored out-of-domain generalization by analyzing
model performance on datasets they were not trained on. Overall, in most cases,
both PatchDSU and DSU outperform other methods. Notably, PatchDSU demonstrates
more consistent improvements across the evaluated scenarios compared to other
approaches.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多维主成分分析（MPCA）的迁移学习框架，用于解决超声导波（UGW）在结构健康监测（SHM）中数据稀缺和泛化能力不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超声导波与机器学习结合在结构健康监测中具有潜力，但数据稀缺和跨材料、传感器配置的泛化能力限制了其大规模应用。

Method: 采用卷积神经网络（CNN）进行损伤定位，结合MPCA和微调技术，实现跨域特征提取和模型适应。

Result: 在12个案例研究中，MPCA方法显著降低了定位误差，优于传统迁移学习技术。

Conclusion: 该方法为UGW-SHM提供了一种高效、数据友好且统计可靠的迁移学习框架。

Abstract: Ultrasonic Guided Waves (UGWs) represent a promising diagnostic tool for
Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) in thin-walled structures, and their
integration with machine learning (ML) algorithms is increasingly being adopted
to enable real-time monitoring capabilities. However, the large-scale
deployment of UGW-based ML methods is constrained by data scarcity and limited
generalisation across different materials and sensor configurations. To address
these limitations, this work proposes a novel transfer learning (TL) framework
based on Multilinear Principal Component Analysis (MPCA). First, a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for regression is trained to perform damage
localisation for a plated structure. Then, MPCA and fine-tuning are combined to
have the CNN work for a different plate. By jointly applying MPCA to the source
and target domains, the method extracts shared latent features, enabling
effective domain adaptation without requiring prior assumptions about
dimensionality. Following MPCA, fine-tuning enables adapting the pre-trained
CNN to a new domain without the need for a large training dataset. The proposed
MPCA-based TL method was tested against 12 case studies involving different
composite materials and sensor arrays. Statistical metrics were used to assess
domains alignment both before and after MPCA, and the results demonstrate a
substantial reduction in localisation error compared to standard TL techniques.
Hence, the proposed approach emerges as a robust, data-efficient, and
statistically based TL framework for UGW-based SHM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在医学图像融合中存在局限性：CNN难以建模全局上下文，Transformer计算复杂度高。State Space Models（SSMs）提供了高效的长距离依赖建模，但在3D数据和临床验证方面研究不足。

Method: 设计了ClinicalFMamba，一种端到端的CNN-Mamba混合架构，结合局部和全局特征建模，并针对3D图像提出了三平面扫描策略。

Result: 在三个数据集上的评估显示，该方法在多个定量指标上表现优越，并能实现实时融合。在脑肿瘤分类任务中，性能优于基线方法。

Conclusion: ClinicalFMamba为高效的多模态医学图像融合提供了新范式，适合实时临床部署。

Abstract: Multimodal medical image fusion integrates complementary information from
different imaging modalities to enhance diagnostic accuracy and treatment
planning. While deep learning methods have advanced performance, existing
approaches face critical limitations: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
excel at local feature extraction but struggle to model global context
effectively, while Transformers achieve superior long-range modeling at the
cost of quadratic computational complexity, limiting clinical deployment.
Recent State Space Models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative, enabling
efficient long-range dependency modeling in linear time through selective scan
mechanisms. Despite these advances, the extension to 3D volumetric data and the
clinical validation of fused images remains underexplored. In this work, we
propose ClinicalFMamba, a novel end-to-end CNN-Mamba hybrid architecture that
synergistically combines local and global feature modeling for 2D and 3D
images. We further design a tri-plane scanning strategy for effectively
learning volumetric dependencies in 3D images. Comprehensive evaluations on
three datasets demonstrate the superior fusion performance across multiple
quantitative metrics while achieving real-time fusion. We further validate the
clinical utility of our approach on downstream 2D/3D brain tumor classification
tasks, achieving superior performance over baseline methods. Our method
establishes a new paradigm for efficient multimodal medical image fusion
suitable for real-time clinical deployment.

Conclusion: 研究为更可解释和临床相关的脑部MRI生成建模奠定了基础，同时指出需要新架构以更准确地捕捉解剖相互依赖关系。

Abstract: Counterfactual generation offers a principled framework for simulating
hypothetical changes in medical imaging, with potential applications in
understanding disease mechanisms and generating physiologically plausible data.
However, generating realistic structural 3D brain MRIs that respect anatomical
and causal constraints remains challenging due to data scarcity, structural
complexity, and the lack of standardized evaluation protocols. In this work, we
convert six generative models into 3D counterfactual approaches by
incorporating an anatomy-guided framework based on a causal graph, in which
regional brain volumes serve as direct conditioning inputs. Each model is
evaluated with respect to composition, reversibility, realism, effectiveness
and minimality on T1-weighted brain MRIs (T1w MRIs) from the Alzheimer's
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). In addition, we test the
generalizability of each model with respect to T1w MRIs of the National
Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA). Our results
indicate that anatomically grounded conditioning successfully modifies the
targeted anatomical regions; however, it exhibits limitations in preserving
non-targeted structures. Beyond laying the groundwork for more interpretable
and clinically relevant generative modeling of brain MRIs, this benchmark
highlights the need for novel architectures that more accurately capture
anatomical interdependencies.

Motivation: 脑部影像的无监督异常检测（UAD）因复杂解剖结构和异常样本稀缺而具有挑战性。

Result: 在主流UAD脑部分割基准测试中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: REFLECT通过修正流提供高效、直接的异常检测与定位，优于传统扩散模型。

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) in brain imaging is crucial for
identifying pathologies without the need for labeled data. However, accurately
localizing anomalies remains challenging due to the intricate structure of
brain anatomy and the scarcity of abnormal examples. In this work, we introduce
REFLECT, a novel framework that leverages rectified flows to establish a
direct, linear trajectory for correcting abnormal MR images toward a normal
distribution. By learning a straight, one-step correction transport map, our
method efficiently corrects brain anomalies and can precisely localize
anomalies by detecting discrepancies between anomalous input and corrected
counterpart. In contrast to the diffusion-based UAD models, which require
iterative stochastic sampling, rectified flows provide a direct transport map,
enabling single-step inference. Extensive experiments on popular UAD brain
segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that REFLECT significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art unsupervised anomaly detection methods. The code is available

Result: 在AREDS数据集上验证，提出的生物标志物对AMD进展具有显著意义，结合现有变量可早期识别高风险患者。

Conclusion: AMD-Mamba框架有望实现更精确和主动的AMD管理。

Abstract: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of irreversible
vision loss, making effective prognosis crucial for timely intervention. In
this work, we propose AMD-Mamba, a novel multi-modal framework for AMD
prognosis, and further develop a new AMD biomarker. This framework integrates
color fundus images with genetic variants and socio-demographic variables. At
its core, AMD-Mamba introduces an innovative metric learning strategy that
leverages AMD severity scale score as prior knowledge. This strategy allows the
model to learn richer feature representations by aligning learned features with
clinical phenotypes, thereby improving the capability of conventional prognosis
methods in capturing disease progression patterns. In addition, unlike existing
models that use traditional CNN backbones and focus primarily on local
information, such as the presence of drusen, AMD-Mamba applies Vision Mamba and
simultaneously fuses local and long-range global information, such as vascular
changes. Furthermore, we enhance prediction performance through multi-scale
fusion, combining image information with clinical variables at different
resolutions. We evaluate AMD-Mamba on the AREDS dataset, which includes 45,818
color fundus photographs, 52 genetic variants, and 3 socio-demographic
variables from 2,741 subjects. Our experimental results demonstrate that our
proposed biomarker is one of the most significant biomarkers for the
progression of AMD. Notably, combining this biomarker with other existing
variables yields promising improvements in detecting high-risk AMD patients at
early stages. These findings highlight the potential of our multi-modal
framework to facilitate more precise and proactive management of AMD.

Abstract: Point clouds have become an increasingly important representation for 3D
medical imaging, offering a compact, surface-preserving alternative to
traditional voxel or mesh-based approaches. Recent advances in deep learning
have enabled rapid progress in extracting, modeling, and analyzing anatomical
shapes directly from point cloud data. This paper provides a comprehensive and
systematic survey of learning-based shape analysis for medical point clouds,
focusing on three fundamental tasks: registration, reconstruction, and
variation modeling. We review recent literature from 2021 to 2025, summarize
representative methods, datasets, and evaluation metrics, and highlight
clinical applications and unique challenges in the medical domain. Key trends
include the integration of hybrid representations, large-scale self-supervised
models, and generative techniques. We also discuss current limitations, such as
data scarcity, inter-patient variability, and the need for interpretable and
robust solutions for clinical deployment. Finally, future directions are
outlined for advancing point cloud-based shape learning in medical imaging.

TL;DR: Nexus-INR提出了一种基于多样化知识引导的任意分辨率超分辨率框架，用于医学图像分析，通过多模态信息和解耦特征提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CNN方法无法适应任意分辨率超分辨率需求，而现有INR方法在多模态图像处理上仍有不足。

Method: Nexus-INR包含双分支编码器、跨模态注意力知识蒸馏模块和集成分割模块，结合解剖结构和模态特征。

Result: 在BraTS2020数据集上，Nexus-INR在超分辨率和分割任务中均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Nexus-INR通过多样化知识引导和多任务学习，实现了高质量的医学图像超分辨率，并提升了下游任务性能。

Abstract: Arbitrary-resolution super-resolution (ARSR) provides crucial flexibility for
medical image analysis by adapting to diverse spatial resolutions. However,
traditional CNN-based methods are inherently ill-suited for ARSR, as they are
typically designed for fixed upsampling factors. While INR-based methods
overcome this limitation, they still struggle to effectively process and
leverage multi-modal images with varying resolutions and details. In this
paper, we propose Nexus-INR, a Diverse Knowledge-guided ARSR framework, which
employs varied information and downstream tasks to achieve high-quality,
adaptive-resolution medical image super-resolution. Specifically, Nexus-INR
contains three key components. A dual-branch encoder with an auxiliary
classification task to effectively disentangle shared anatomical structures and
modality-specific features; a knowledge distillation module using cross-modal
attention that guides low-resolution modality reconstruction with
high-resolution reference, enhanced by self-supervised consistency loss; an
integrated segmentation module that embeds anatomical semantics to improve both
reconstruction quality and downstream segmentation performance. Experiments on
the BraTS2020 dataset for both super-resolution and downstream segmentation
demonstrate that Nexus-INR outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various
metrics.

Motivation: 胸部X光片中骨骼结构会遮挡关键细节，影响诊断准确性。现有扩散模型在骨骼抑制和细节保留之间存在平衡问题，且计算成本高。

Method: 采用Global-Local Latent Consistency Model（GL-LCM）架构，结合肺部分割、双路径采样和全局-局部融合，并引入局部增强指导以减少边界伪影和细节模糊。

Result: 在自建数据集SZCH-X-Rays和公开数据集JSRT上的实验表明，GL-LCM在骨骼抑制和计算效率上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GL-LCM为临床提供了一种高效、高分辨率的骨骼抑制解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Chest X-Ray (CXR) imaging for pulmonary diagnosis raises significant
challenges, primarily because bone structures can obscure critical details
necessary for accurate diagnosis. Recent advances in deep learning,
particularly with diffusion models, offer significant promise for effectively
minimizing the visibility of bone structures in CXR images, thereby improving
clarity and diagnostic accuracy. Nevertheless, existing diffusion-based methods
for bone suppression in CXR imaging struggle to balance the complete
suppression of bones with preserving local texture details. Additionally, their
high computational demand and extended processing time hinder their practical
use in clinical settings. To address these limitations, we introduce a
Global-Local Latent Consistency Model (GL-LCM) architecture. This model
combines lung segmentation, dual-path sampling, and global-local fusion,
enabling fast high-resolution bone suppression in CXR images. To tackle
potential boundary artifacts and detail blurring in local-path sampling, we
further propose Local-Enhanced Guidance, which addresses these issues without
additional training. Comprehensive experiments on a self-collected dataset
SZCH-X-Rays, and the public dataset JSRT, reveal that our GL-LCM delivers
superior bone suppression and remarkable computational efficiency,
significantly outperforming several competitive methods. Our code is available
at https://github.com/diaoquesang/GL-LCM.

Motivation: 探索术前MRI是否能为根治性前列腺切除术后的ED预测提供额外价值。

Method: 评估四种模型策略：仅临床特征、基于MRI手工特征、深度学习MRI切片、多模态融合。

Result: MRI模型（AUC 0.569）略优于手工特征（AUC 0.554），但不及临床基线（AUC 0.663）。多模态融合效果有限（AUC 0.586）。

Conclusion: MRI模型未超越临床特征，但可能通过关注相关解剖结构为未来多模态方法提供补充。

Abstract: Accurate preoperative prediction of erectile dysfunction (ED) is important
for counseling patients undergoing radical prostatectomy. While clinical
features are established predictors, the added value of preoperative MRI
remains underexplored. We investigate whether MRI provides additional
predictive value for ED at 12 months post-surgery, evaluating four modeling
strategies: (1) a clinical-only baseline, representing current
state-of-the-art; (2) classical models using handcrafted anatomical features
derived from MRI; (3) deep learning models trained directly on MRI slices; and
(4) multimodal fusion of imaging and clinical inputs. Imaging-based models
(maximum AUC 0.569) slightly outperformed handcrafted anatomical approaches
(AUC 0.554) but fell short of the clinical baseline (AUC 0.663). Fusion models
offered marginal gains (AUC 0.586) but did not exceed clinical-only
performance. SHAP analysis confirmed that clinical features contributed most to
predictive performance. Saliency maps from the best-performing imaging model
suggested a predominant focus on anatomically plausible regions, such as the
prostate and neurovascular bundles. While MRI-based models did not improve
predictive performance over clinical features, our findings suggest that they
try to capture patterns in relevant anatomical structures and may complement
clinical predictors in future multimodal approaches.

TL;DR: CADD是一种基于条件扩散模型的3D图像规范建模方法，通过结合临床信息优化异常检测。

Motivation: 解决医学图像中异质队列的病理检测难题，结合临床信息提升检测准确性。

Method: 提出条件扩散模型CADD，采用新颖的推理修复策略平衡异常去除与保留个体特征。

Result: 在三个具有挑战性的数据集上，CADD实现了神经异常检测的最优性能。

Conclusion: CADD为异质医学队列的病理检测提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Applying machine learning to real-world medical data, e.g. from hospital
archives, has the potential to revolutionize disease detection in brain images.
However, detecting pathology in such heterogeneous cohorts is a difficult
challenge. Normative modeling, a form of unsupervised anomaly detection, offers
a promising approach to studying such cohorts where the ``normal'' behavior is
modeled and can be used at subject level to detect deviations relating to
disease pathology. Diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools for anomaly
detection due to their ability to capture complex data distributions and
generate high-quality images. Their performance relies on image restoration;
differences between the original and restored images highlight potential
abnormalities. However, unlike normative models, these diffusion model
approaches do not incorporate clinical information which provides important
context to guide the disease detection process. Furthermore, standard
approaches often poorly restore healthy regions, resulting in poor
reconstructions and suboptimal detection performance. We present CADD, the
first conditional diffusion model for normative modeling in 3D images. To guide
the healthy restoration process, we propose a novel inference inpainting
strategy which balances anomaly removal with retention of subject-specific
features. Evaluated on three challenging datasets, including clinical scans,
which may have lower contrast, thicker slices, and motion artifacts, CADD
achieves state-of-the-art performance in detecting neurological abnormalities
in heterogeneous cohorts.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种保护用户隐私的反事实解释检索框架，包括基线方案和改进方案，同时考虑了不可变特征和用户偏好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险应用中，黑盒机器学习模型需要透明和可解释性，但反事实解释可能威胁用户隐私。本文旨在保护用户在检索反事实解释时的隐私。

Method: 提出了私有反事实检索（PCR）基线方案，改进以减少数据库信息泄露；扩展为不可变PCR（I-PCR）以处理不可变特征；并引入用户偏好以生成更实用的解释。

Result: 理论分析和数值结果表明，所提方案能完美保护用户隐私，同时减少数据库信息泄露。

Conclusion: 该框架在保护隐私的同时提供了有效的反事实解释，适用于高风险应用。

Abstract: Transparency and explainability are two important aspects to be considered
when employing black-box machine learning models in high-stake applications.
Providing counterfactual explanations is one way of catering this requirement.
However, this also poses a threat to the privacy of the institution that is
providing the explanation, as well as the user who is requesting it. In this
work, we are primarily concerned with the user's privacy who wants to retrieve
a counterfactual instance, without revealing their feature vector to the
institution. Our framework retrieves the exact nearest neighbor counterfactual
explanation from a database of accepted points while achieving perfect,
information-theoretic, privacy for the user. First, we introduce the problem of
private counterfactual retrieval (PCR) and propose a baseline PCR scheme that
keeps the user's feature vector information-theoretically private from the
institution. Building on this, we propose two other schemes that reduce the
amount of information leaked about the institution database to the user,
compared to the baseline scheme. Second, we relax the assumption of mutability
of all features, and consider the setting of immutable PCR (I-PCR). Here, the
user retrieves the nearest counterfactual without altering a private subset of
their features, which constitutes the immutable set, while keeping their
feature vector and immutable set private from the institution. For this, we
propose two schemes that preserve the user's privacy information-theoretically,
but ensure varying degrees of database privacy. Third, we extend our PCR and
I-PCR schemes to incorporate user's preference on transforming their
attributes, so that a more actionable explanation can be received. Finally, we
present numerical results to support our theoretical findings, and compare the
database leakage of the proposed schemes.

<details>

Motivation: 低精度计算虽然提高了检索系统的效率，但会导致评分平局问题，进而引发结果的高变异性，影响评估的可靠性。

Method: 提出HPS（在最终评分步骤中提升精度以解决平局）和TRM（量化平局候选的顺序不确定性）。

Result: 实验表明HPS显著减少了平局引起的不稳定性，TRM准确恢复了预期指标值。

Conclusion: HPS和TRM的组合为低精度检索提供了更一致和可靠的评估系统。

Abstract: Lowering the numerical precision of model parameters and computations is
widely adopted to improve the efficiency of retrieval systems. However, when
computing relevance scores between the query and documents in low-precision, we
observe spurious ties due to the reduced granularity. This introduces high
variability in the results based on tie resolution, making the evaluation less
reliable. To address this, we propose a more robust retrieval evaluation
protocol designed to reduce score variation. It consists of: (1) High-Precision
Scoring (HPS), which upcasts the final scoring step to higher precision to
resolve tied candidates with minimal computational cost; and (2) Tie-aware
Retrieval Metrics (TRM), which report expected scores, range, and bias to
quantify order uncertainty of tied candidates. Our experiments test multiple
models with three scoring functions on two retrieval datasets to demonstrate
that HPS dramatically reduces tie-induced instability, and TRM accurately
recovers expected metric values. This combination enables a more consistent and
reliable evaluation system for lower-precision retrievals.

Motivation: 多源检索增强生成（RAG）虽然信息丰富，但数据稀疏性和源间不一致性会加剧幻觉问题。

Method: 提出MultiRAG框架，包含知识构建模块（多源线图聚合逻辑关系）和检索模块（多级置信度计算消除不可靠信息）。

Result: 在四个多领域查询数据集和两个多跳QA数据集上，MultiRAG显著提升了知识检索的可靠性和效率。

Conclusion: MultiRAG有效缓解了多源RAG中的幻觉问题，为复杂场景下的知识检索提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising solution to
address hallucination issues in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the
integration of multiple retrieval sources, while potentially more informative,
introduces new challenges that can paradoxically exacerbate hallucination
problems. These challenges manifest primarily in two aspects: the sparse
distribution of multi-source data that hinders the capture of logical
relationships and the inherent inconsistencies among different sources that
lead to information conflicts. To address these challenges, we propose
MultiRAG, a novel framework designed to mitigate hallucination in multi-source
retrieval-augmented generation through knowledge-guided approaches. Our
framework introduces two key innovations: (1) a knowledge construction module
that employs multi-source line graphs to efficiently aggregate logical
relationships across different knowledge sources, effectively addressing the
sparse data distribution issue; and (2) a sophisticated retrieval module that
implements a multi-level confidence calculation mechanism, performing both
graph-level and node-level assessments to identify and eliminate unreliable
information nodes, thereby reducing hallucinations caused by inter-source
inconsistencies. Extensive experiments on four multi-domain query datasets and
two multi-hop QA datasets demonstrate that MultiRAG significantly enhances the
reliability and efficiency of knowledge retrieval in complex multi-source
scenarios. \textcolor{blue}{Our code is available in

Motivation: 单向量搜索在跨域、长上下文和复杂检索任务中表现不佳，而多向量方法（如ColBERT）虽具优势，但缺乏易用工具。

Method: 开发PyLate库，继承Sentence Transformers的高效训练和日志功能，支持多向量架构，提供高效索引等特性。

Result: PyLate已成功开发出先进模型（如GTE-ModernColBERT和Reason-ModernColBERT），验证了其研究和生产实用性。

Conclusion: PyLate填补了多向量模型工具空白，有望推动现代信息检索系统的发展。

Abstract: Neural ranking has become a cornerstone of modern information retrieval.
While single vector search remains the dominant paradigm, it suffers from the
shortcoming of compressing all the information into a single vector. This
compression leads to notable performance degradation in out-of-domain,
long-context, and reasoning-intensive retrieval tasks. Multi-vector approaches
pioneered by ColBERT aim to address these limitations by preserving individual
token embeddings and computing similarity via the MaxSim operator. This
architecture has demonstrated superior empirical advantages, including enhanced
out-of-domain generalization, long-context handling, and performance in complex
retrieval scenarios. Despite these compelling empirical results and clear
theoretical advantages, the practical adoption and public availability of late
interaction models remain low compared to their single-vector counterparts,
primarily due to a lack of accessible and modular tools for training and
experimenting with such models. To bridge this gap, we introduce PyLate, a
streamlined library built on top of Sentence Transformers to support
multi-vector architectures natively, inheriting its efficient training,
advanced logging, and automated model card generation while requiring minimal
code changes to code templates users are already familiar with. By offering
multi-vector-specific features such as efficient indexes, PyLate aims to
accelerate research and real-world application of late interaction models,
thereby unlocking their full potential in modern IR systems. Finally, PyLate
has already enabled the development of state-of-the-art models, including
GTE-ModernColBERT and Reason-ModernColBERT, demonstrating its practical utility
for both research and production environments.

Conclusion: 该工作首次成功实现了Foundation-Expert范式的大规模部署，为推荐系统的扩展提供了高效、开发者友好的解决方案。

Abstract: While scaling laws promise significant performance gains for recommender
systems, efficiently deploying hyperscale models remains a major unsolved
challenge. In contrast to fields where FMs are already widely adopted such as
natural language processing and computer vision, progress in recommender
systems is hindered by unique challenges including the need to learn from
online streaming data under shifting data distributions, the need to adapt to
different recommendation surfaces with a wide diversity in their downstream
tasks and their input distributions, and stringent latency and computational
constraints. To bridge this gap, we propose to leverage the Foundation-Expert
Paradigm: a framework designed for the development and deployment of hyperscale
recommendation FMs. In our approach, a central FM is trained on lifelong,
cross-surface, multi-modal user data to learn generalizable knowledge. This
knowledge is then efficiently transferred to various lightweight,
surface-specific ``expert" models via target-aware embeddings, allowing them to
adapt to local data distributions and optimization goals with minimal overhead.
To meet our training, inference and development needs, we built HyperCast, a
production-grade infrastructure system that re-engineers training, serving,
logging and iteration to power this decoupled paradigm. Our approach is now
deployed at Meta serving tens of billions of user requests daily, demonstrating
online metric improvements over our previous one-stage production system while
improving developer velocity and maintaining infrastructure efficiency. To the
best of our knowledge, this work represents the first successful deployment of
a Foundation-Expert paradigm at this scale, offering a proven,
compute-efficient, and developer-friendly blueprint to realize the promise of
scaling laws in recommender systems.

Result: 系统在部分标记数据下表现稳健，MAP@100为0.83，MRR@100为0.92，优于传统模型。

Conclusion: 该系统为监管者提供了高效、准确的历史参考，显著提升了措施制定的一致性和有效性。

Abstract: Bank supervisors face the complex task of ensuring that new measures are
consistently aligned with historical precedents. To address this challenge, we
introduce a novel Information Retrieval (IR) System tailored to assist
supervisors in drafting both consistent and effective measures. This system
ingests findings from on-site investigations. It then retrieves the most
relevant historical findings and their associated measures from a comprehensive
database, providing a solid basis for supervisors to write well-informed
measures for new findings. Utilizing a blend of lexical, semantic, and Capital
Requirements Regulation (CRR) fuzzy set matching techniques, the IR system
ensures the retrieval of findings that closely align with current cases. The
performance of this system, particularly in scenarios with partially labeled
data, is validated through a Monte Carlo methodology, showcasing its robustness
and accuracy. Enhanced by a Transformer-based Denoising AutoEncoder for
fine-tuning, the final model achieves a Mean Average Precision (MAP@100) of
0.83 and a Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR@100) of 0.92. These scores surpass those
of both standalone lexical models such as BM25 and semantic BERT-like models.

Motivation: 现代推荐系统中用户和物品的表示模块通常由两个独立的神经网络组成，而多模态表示学习中权重共享已被证明有效。受此启发，研究提出在用户和物品的神经网络模块中共享权重。

Method: 提出CoBraR框架，使用单一协作分支（Collaborative Branch for Recommendation）在共享嵌入空间中获取用户和物品的潜在表示。

Result: 在电商和电影推荐任务上的实验表明，CoBraR减少了参数数量，提升了非准确性指标，且未影响准确性。

Conclusion: CoBraR具有在实际场景中应用和扩展的潜力。

Abstract: Recommender Systems (RS) often rely on representations of users and items in
a joint embedding space and on a similarity metric to compute relevance scores.
In modern RS, the modules to obtain user and item representations consist of
two distinct and separate neural networks (NN). In multimodal representation
learning, weight sharing has been proven effective in reducing the distance
between multiple modalities of a same item. Inspired by these approaches, we
propose a novel RS that leverages weight sharing between the user and item NN
modules used to obtain the latent representations in the shared embedding
space. The proposed framework consists of a single Collaborative Branch for
Recommendation (CoBraR). We evaluate CoBraR by means of quantitative
experiments on e-commerce and movie recommendation. Our experiments show that
by reducing the number of parameters and improving beyond-accuracy aspects
without compromising accuracy, CoBraR has the potential to be applied and
extended for real-world scenarios.

Method: 采用两步LLM蒸馏过程，从LLM教师模型通过交叉编码器助手蒸馏到双编码器学生模型，结合多任务训练。

Result: 实验表明，该方法有效提升了双编码器在eBay广告关键词检索中的性能。

Conclusion: 通过LLM蒸馏和多任务训练，能够显著提高关键词推荐的准确性和相关性。

Abstract: Sellers at eBay are recommended keyphrases to bid on to enhance the
performance of their advertising campaigns. The relevance of these keyphrases
is crucial in avoiding the overcrowding of search systems with irrelevant items
and maintaining a positive seller perception. It is essential that keyphrase
recommendations align with both seller and Search judgments regarding auctions.
Due to the difficulty in procuring negative human judgment at scale, employing
LLM-as-a-judge to mimic seller judgment has been established as the norm in
several studies. This study introduces a novel two-step LLM distillation
process from a LLM-judge used to debias our Embedding Based Retrieval (EBR)
model from the various biases that exist in click-data. We distill from an LLM
teacher via a cross-encoder assistant into a bi-encoder student using a
multi-task training approach, ultimately employing the student bi-encoder to
retrieve relevant advertiser keyphrases. We show that integrating a knowledge
distillation process from LLMs in a multi-task training setup enhances
bi-encoder performance in retrieving relevant advertiser keyphrases at eBay.

Conclusion: RED是首个在动态商业环境中大规模推荐食物集合的系统，离线指标与在线表现强相关。

Abstract: Food delivery platforms face the challenge of helping users navigate vast
catalogs of restaurants and dishes to find meals they truly enjoy. This paper
presents RED, an automated recommendation system designed for iFood, Latin
America's largest on-demand food delivery platform, to personalize the
selection of curated food collections displayed to millions of users. Our
approach employs a LightGBM classifier that scores collections based on three
feature groups: collection characteristics, user-collection similarity, and
contextual information. To address the cold-start problem of recommending newly
created collections, we develop content-based representations using item
embeddings and implement monotonicity constraints to improve generalization. We
tackle data scarcity by bootstrapping from category carousel interactions and
address visibility bias through unbiased sampling of impressions and purchases
in production. The system demonstrates significant real-world impact through
extensive A/B testing with 5-10% of iFood's user base. Online results of our
A/B tests add up to 97% improvement in Card Conversion Rate and 1.4% increase
in overall App Conversion Rate compared to popularity-based baselines. Notably,
our offline accuracy metrics strongly correlate with online performance,
enabling reliable impact prediction before deployment. To our knowledge, this
is the first work to detail large-scale recommendation of curated food
collections in a dynamic commercial environment.

### [400] [Spatiotemporal wall pressure forecast of a rectangular cylinder with physics-aware DeepUFNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03183)
*Junle Liu,Chang Liu,Yanyu Ke,Wenliang Chen,Kihing Shum,K. T. Tse,Gang Hu*

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种物理感知的DeepU-Fourier神经网络（DeepUFNet），用于预测矩形圆柱体绕流的时空壁压，结合UNet和傅里叶神经网络，并通过物理高频损失控制优化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习框架多局限于利用完整空间信息预测单一时刻的压力系数，而时空壁压预测的需求尚未得到充分满足。

Method: 开发了DeepUFNet模型，结合UNet和傅里叶神经网络，嵌入物理高频损失控制系数β，通过风洞实验数据训练和测试模型。

Result: DeepUFNet能高精度预测时空壁压，统计信息、时间变化、功率谱密度、空间分布和时空相关性均与实验数据吻合。高频损失控制显著提升了模型性能。

Conclusion: DeepUFNet在时空壁压预测中表现优异，尤其在稀疏空间信息输入下仍具良好外推能力。

Abstract: The wall pressure is of great importance in understanding the forces and
structural responses induced by fluid. Recent works have investigated the
potential of deep learning techniques in predicting mean pressure coefficients
and fluctuating pressure coefficients, but most of existing deep learning
frameworks are limited to predicting a single snapshot using full spatial
information. To forecast spatiotemporal wall pressure of flow past a
rectangular cylinder, this study develops a physics-aware DeepU-Fourier neural
Network (DeepUFNet) deep learning model. DeepUFNet comprises the UNet structure
and the Fourier neural network, with physical high-frequency loss control
embedded in the model training stage to optimize model performance, where the
parameter $\beta$ varies with the development of the training epoch. Wind
tunnel testing is performed to collect wall pressures of a two-dimensional
rectangular cylinder with a side ratio of 1.5 at an angle of attack of zero
using high-frequency pressure scanning, thereby constructing a database for
DeepUFNet training and testing. The DeepUFNet model is found to forecast
spatiotemporal wall pressure information with high accuracy. The comparison
between forecast results and experimental data presents agreement in
statistical information, temporal pressure variation, power spectrum density,
spatial distribution, and spatiotemporal correlation. It is also found that
embedding a physical high-frequency loss control coefficient $\beta$ in the
DeepUFNet model can significantly improve model performance in forecasting
spatiotemporal wall pressure information, in particular, in forecasting
high-order frequency fluctuation and wall pressure variance. Furthermore, the
DeepUFNet extrapolation capability is tested with sparse spatial information
input, and the model presents a satisfactory extrapolation ability

TL;DR: 论文探讨了通过新型加速度计配置（如冷原子干涉仪和混合EA-CAI）及机器学习方法提升地球重力场监测精度的方法，发现混合配置效果最佳，移植方法为经济高效替代方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地球重力场监测对气候、水文和地球动力学研究至关重要，但传统静电加速度计（EA）存在局限性，需探索新技术提升精度和数据连续性。

Method: 研究系统评估了加速度计数据移植，采用冷原子干涉仪（CAI）和混合EA-CAI配置，结合解析与机器学习方法，通过闭环LL-SST模拟比较四种场景。

Result: 双混合配置重力场恢复最准确，但移植混合配置（尤其是机器学习支持）为经济高效替代方案，性能接近且硬件需求低。

Conclusion: 量子传感器技术与数据驱动移植结合为未来卫星重力测量任务提供新方向，有望提升全球重力场动态监测能力。

Abstract: Accurate and continuous monitoring of Earth's gravity field is essential for
tracking mass redistribution processes linked to climate variability,
hydrological cycles, and geodynamic phenomena. While the GRACE and GRACE
Follow-On (GRACE-FO) missions have set the benchmark for satellite gravimetry
using low-low satellite to satellite tracking (LL-SST), the precision of
gravity field recovery still strongly depends on the quality of accelerometer
(ACC) performance and the continuity of ACC data. Traditional electrostatic
accelerometers (EA) face limitations that can hinder mission outcomes,
prompting exploration of advanced sensor technologies and data recovery
techniques. This study presents a systematic evaluation of accelerometer data
transplantation using novel accelerometer configurations, including Cold Atom
Interferometry (CAI) accelerometers and hybrid EA-CAI setups, and applying both
analytical and machine learning-based methods. Using comprehensive closed-loop
LL-SST simulations, we compare four scenarios ranging from the conventional
EA-only setup to ideal dual hybrid configurations, with a particular focus on
the performance of transplant-based approaches using different neural network
approaches. Our results show that the dual hybrid configuration provides the
most accurate gravity field retrieval. However, the transplant-based hybrid
setup, especially when supported by machine learning, emerges as a robust and
cost-effective alternative, achieving comparable performance with minimal extra
hardware. These findings highlight the promise of combining quantum sensor
technology and data-driven transplantation for future satellite gravimetry
missions, paving the way for improved global monitoring of Earth's dynamic
gravity field.

### [402] [A Novel cVAE-Augmented Deep Learning Framework for Pan-Cancer RNA-Seq Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02743)
*Vinil Polepalli*

Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于类别条件变分自编码器（cVAE）的深度学习框架，通过生成合成数据增强训练集，显著提高了泛癌基因表达分类的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决泛癌分类中高维数据和样本量不足的挑战，尤其是针对少数类别的肿瘤分类问题。

Method: 使用cVAE生成合成基因表达样本，结合特征选择和MLP分类器，增强训练集以改善分类性能。

Result: 在测试集上达到约98%的分类准确率，显著优于仅使用原始数据的分类器。

Conclusion: cVAE合成数据增强可显著提升泛癌预测性能，尤其适用于样本不足的肿瘤类别。

Abstract: Pan-cancer classification using transcriptomic (RNA-Seq) data can inform
tumor subtyping and therapy selection, but is challenging due to extremely high
dimensionality and limited sample sizes. In this study, we propose a novel deep
learning framework that uses a class-conditional variational autoencoder (cVAE)
to augment training data for pan-cancer gene expression classification. Using
801 tumor RNA-Seq samples spanning 5 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA), we first perform feature selection to reduce 20,531 gene expression
features to the 500 most variably expressed genes. A cVAE is then trained on
this data to learn a latent representation of gene expression conditioned on
cancer type, enabling the generation of synthetic gene expression samples for
each tumor class. We augment the training set with these cVAE-generated samples
(doubling the dataset size) to mitigate overfitting and class imbalance. A
two-layer multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier is subsequently trained on the
augmented dataset to predict tumor type. The augmented framework achieves high
classification accuracy (~98%) on a held-out test set, substantially
outperforming a classifier trained on the original data alone. We present
detailed experimental results, including VAE training curves, classifier
performance metrics (ROC curves and confusion matrix), and architecture
diagrams to illustrate the approach. The results demonstrate that cVAE-based
synthetic augmentation can significantly improve pan-cancer prediction
performance, especially for underrepresented cancer classes.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: MAST框架通过多轮自适应隐蔽篡改攻击LLM-MAS系统，显著提升攻击成功率和隐蔽性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有攻击方法在效果、适应性和隐蔽性上存在局限，需开发更高效的攻击框架。

Method: 结合蒙特卡洛树搜索和直接偏好优化，训练攻击策略模型，并引入语义和嵌入相似性约束。

Result: MAST在多样任务和架构中表现优异，攻击成功率高且隐蔽性强。

Conclusion: MAST框架高效隐蔽，凸显了LLM-MAS需加强通信防护的必要性。

Abstract: Large language model-based multi-agent systems (LLM-MAS) effectively
accomplish complex and dynamic tasks through inter-agent communication, but
this reliance introduces substantial safety vulnerabilities. Existing attack
methods targeting LLM-MAS either compromise agent internals or rely on direct
and overt persuasion, which limit their effectiveness, adaptability, and
stealthiness. In this paper, we propose MAST, a Multi-round Adaptive Stealthy
Tampering framework designed to exploit communication vulnerabilities within
the system. MAST integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search with Direct Preference
Optimization to train an attack policy model that adaptively generates
effective multi-round tampering strategies. Furthermore, to preserve
stealthiness, we impose dual semantic and embedding similarity constraints
during the tampering process. Comprehensive experiments across diverse tasks,
communication architectures, and LLMs demonstrate that MAST consistently
achieves high attack success rates while significantly enhancing stealthiness
compared to baselines. These findings highlight the effectiveness,
stealthiness, and adaptability of MAST, underscoring the need for robust
communication safeguards in LLM-MAS.

### [404] [Agentic Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02836)
*Mengyu Zhang,Zhuotao Liu,Jingwen Huang,Xuanqi Liu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Agentic-PPML的新框架，旨在解决大型语言模型（LLMs）中隐私保护机器学习（PPML）的效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前PPML方案在LLMs中效率极低，无法满足实际需求，尤其是在上下文长度增加时。

Method: 通过将语言意图解析（不涉及敏感信息）与隐私关键计算模块化分离，利用通用LLM进行意图理解，并将加密推理任务委托给垂直领域的专用模型。

Result: Agentic-PPML避免了LLMs处理加密提示的需求，显著提升了效率。

Conclusion: 该框架为隐私保护LLM服务的实际部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML) is critical to ensure data privacy
in AI. Over the past few years, the community has proposed a wide range of
provably secure PPML schemes that rely on various cryptography primitives.
However, when it comes to large language models (LLMs) with billions of
parameters, the efficiency of PPML is everything but acceptable. For instance,
the state-of-the-art solution for confidential LLM inference represents at
least 10,000-fold slower performance compared to plaintext inference. The
performance gap is even larger when the context length increases. In this
position paper, we propose a novel framework named Agentic-PPML to make PPML in
LLMs practical. Our key insight is to employ a general-purpose LLM for intent
understanding and delegate cryptographically secure inference to specialized
models trained on vertical domains. By modularly separating language intent
parsing - which typically involves little or no sensitive information - from
privacy-critical computation, Agentic-PPML completely eliminates the need for
the LLMs to process the encrypted prompts, enabling practical deployment of
privacy-preserving LLM-centric services.

*Jiewei Lai,Lan Zhang,Chen Tang,Pengcheng Sun,Xinming Wang,Yunhao Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种乘法攻击方法，能够彻底消除生成模型（GMs）的痕迹，使DeepFakes无法被溯源，即使面对增强的防御措施也能成功。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有攻击方法无法完全消除GMs的痕迹，导致可被防御措施缓解。因此，需要一种更彻底的攻击方法，以探索更鲁棒的溯源模型（AMs）。

Method: 设计了一种通用且黑盒的攻击方法，仅使用真实数据训练对抗模型，适用于多种GMs且不依赖AMs的具体实现。

Result: 实验表明，该方法对6种先进AMs和9种GMs生成的DeepFakes平均攻击成功率达97.08%，即使在防御机制下仍保持72.39%的成功率。

Conclusion: 乘法攻击对现有AMs构成重大挑战，强调了开发更鲁棒AMs的必要性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in DeepFakes attribution technologies have significantly
enhanced forensic capabilities, enabling the extraction of traces left by
generative models (GMs) in images, making DeepFakes traceable back to their
source GMs. Meanwhile, several attacks have attempted to evade attribution
models (AMs) for exploring their limitations, calling for more robust AMs.
However, existing attacks fail to eliminate GMs' traces, thus can be mitigated
by defensive measures. In this paper, we identify that untraceable DeepFakes
can be achieved through a multiplicative attack, which can fundamentally
eliminate GMs' traces, thereby evading AMs even enhanced with defensive
measures. We design a universal and black-box attack method that trains an
adversarial model solely using real data, applicable for various GMs and
agnostic to AMs. Experimental results demonstrate the outstanding attack
capability and universal applicability of our method, achieving an average
attack success rate (ASR) of 97.08\% against 6 advanced AMs on DeepFakes
generated by 9 GMs. Even in the presence of defensive mechanisms, our method
maintains an ASR exceeding 72.39\%. Our work underscores the potential
challenges posed by multiplicative attacks and highlights the need for more
robust AMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决用户因数据隐私问题无法直接使用LLM API，以及私有部署计算成本高的问题。

Method: 提出VFLAIR-LLM框架，支持两种LLM分区设置、三种任务类型和18个数据集，并提供攻击与防御的标准模块。

Result: 测试了5种攻击和9种防御策略，为实际应用提供了模型分区配置、防御策略和超参数选择的建议。

Conclusion: VFLAIR-LLM为资源受限环境下的隐私保护LLM适应提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: With the advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM applications have
expanded into a growing number of fields. However, users with data privacy
concerns face limitations in directly utilizing LLM APIs, while private
deployments incur significant computational demands. This creates a substantial
challenge in achieving secure LLM adaptation under constrained local resources.
To address this issue, collaborative learning methods, such as Split Learning
(SL), offer a resource-efficient and privacy-preserving solution for adapting
LLMs to private domains. In this study, we introduce VFLAIR-LLM (available at
https://github.com/FLAIR-THU/VFLAIR-LLM), an extensible and lightweight split
learning framework for LLMs, enabling privacy-preserving LLM inference and
fine-tuning in resource-constrained environments. Our library provides two LLM
partition settings, supporting three task types and 18 datasets. In addition,
we provide standard modules for implementing and evaluating attacks and
defenses. We benchmark 5 attacks and 9 defenses under various Split Learning
for LLM(SL-LLM) settings, offering concrete insights and recommendations on the
choice of model partition configurations, defense strategies, and relevant
hyperparameters for real-world applications.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新型轻量级后门攻击方法BadBlocks，能在扩散模型中高效注入后门并规避现有防御框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后门攻击方法资源消耗大且易被检测，BadBlocks旨在提供更轻量、隐蔽的攻击方式。

Method: 通过选择性污染UNet架构的特定模块，BadBlocks仅需30%计算资源和20%GPU时间。

Result: 实验显示BadBlocks攻击成功率高，感知质量损失低，并能绕过现有防御框架。

Conclusion: BadBlocks显著降低了后门攻击门槛，威胁扩散模型的安全性。

Abstract: In recent years,Diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in the
field of image generation.However,recent studies have shown that diffusion
models are susceptible to backdoor attacks,in which attackers can manipulate
the output by injecting covert triggers such as specific visual patterns or
textual phrases into the training dataset.Fortunately,with the continuous
advancement of defense techniques,defenders have become increasingly capable of
identifying and mitigating most backdoor attacks using visual inspection and
neural network-based detection methods.However,in this paper,we identify a
novel type of backdoor threat that is more lightweight and covert than existing
approaches,which we name BadBlocks,requires only about 30\% of the
computational resources and 20\% GPU time typically needed by previous backdoor
attacks,yet it successfully injects backdoors and evades the most advanced
defense frameworks.BadBlocks enables attackers to selectively contaminate
specific blocks within the UNet architecture of diffusion models while
maintaining normal functionality in the remaining components.Experimental
results demonstrate that BadBlocks achieves a high attack success rate (ASR)
and low perceptual quality loss (as measured by FID Score),even under extremely
constrained computational resources and GPU time.Moreover,BadBlocks is able to
bypass existing defense frameworks,especially the attention-based backdoor
detection method, highlighting it as a novel and noteworthy threat.Ablation
studies further demonstrate that effective backdoor injection does not require
fine-tuning the entire network and highlight the pivotal role of certain neural
network layers in backdoor mapping.Overall,BadBlocks significantly reduces the
barrier to conducting backdoor attacks in all aspects.It enables attackers to
inject backdoors into large-scale diffusion models even using consumer-grade
GPUs.

Abstract: Existing cybersecurity playbooks are often written in heterogeneous,
non-machine-readable formats, which limits their automation and
interoperability across Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response
platforms. This paper explores the suitability of Large Language Models,
combined with Prompt Engineering, to automatically translate legacy incident
response playbooks into the standardized, machine-readable CACAO format. We
systematically examine various Prompt Engineering techniques and carefully
design prompts aimed at maximizing syntactic accuracy and semantic fidelity for
control flow preservation. Our modular transformation pipeline integrates a
syntax checker to ensure syntactic correctness and features an iterative
refinement mechanism that progressively reduces syntactic errors. We evaluate
the proposed approach on a custom-generated dataset comprising diverse legacy
playbooks paired with manually created CACAO references. The results
demonstrate that our method significantly improves the accuracy of playbook
transformation over baseline models, effectively captures complex workflow
structures, and substantially reduces errors. It highlights the potential for
practical deployment in automated cybersecurity playbook transformation tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于主观体验结构动态的量子力学形式重构，使用Qualia Abstraction Language（QAL）建模物理系统，而非传统的希尔伯特空间状态向量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统量子力学依赖外部数学抽象，而QAL旨在通过第一人称结构的正式词汇填补语言空白，解决观察者悖论。

Method: QAL将物理系统建模为内省单元的动态流，重新定义叠加、坍缩和纠缠等核心概念。

Result: QAL提供了一种内源性变换框架，将观察者嵌入系统，并与内物理方法一致。

Conclusion: QAL为后柏拉图主义、基于内省的物理学提供了新的理论基础。

Abstract: We propose a formal reconstruction of quantum mechanics grounded not in
external mathematical abstractions, but in the structured dynamics of
subjective experience. The Qualia Abstraction Language (QAL) models physical
systems as evolving streams of introspective units, structured sequences of
modality, shape, and functional effect, rather than as state vectors in Hilbert
space. This approach reimagines core quantum concepts: superposition becomes a
form of structured ambiguity; collapse is reframed as an introspective
contraction; and entanglement is modeled as semantic resonance across streams
of qualia. Drawing on insights from nominalist philosophy and oversight
theoretic limits in AI, we argue that the observer paradox in quantum mechanics
reflects not an ontological lacuna, but a linguistic one: the absence of a
formal vocabulary for modeling first person structure. QAL introduces such a
vocabulary, providing a morphodynamic framework that embeds the observer within
the system and replaces abstract projection with endogenous transformation. We
analyze the alignment of QAL with endophysical approaches, contrast it with
standard interpretations of quantum theory, and explore its implications for a
post Platonist, introspectively grounded physics.

Motivation: 研究在非马尔可夫随机波动率模型下，如何利用路径签名改进机器学习方法，以更高效地对冲奇异衍生品。

Method: 在深度学习中，将路径签名作为前馈神经网络的输入特征；在浅层学习中，比较了两种回归方法：一种直接从价格过程的期望签名学习对冲策略，另一种通过签名波动率模型建模波动率动态。

Result: 深度学习中使用签名特征比LSTM更优且计算量更少；浅层学习中，基于签名波动率模型的方法在不同支付和波动率动态下表现更准确和稳定。

Conclusion: 路径签名在机器学习的对冲问题中表现出色，尤其在非马尔可夫环境下，签名方法提供了高效且稳定的解决方案。

Abstract: We investigate the use of path signatures in a machine learning context for
hedging exotic derivatives under non-Markovian stochastic volatility models. In
a deep learning setting, we use signatures as features in feedforward neural
networks and show that they outperform LSTMs in most cases, with orders of
magnitude less training compute. In a shallow learning setting, we compare two
regression approaches: the first directly learns the hedging strategy from the
expected signature of the price process; the second models the dynamics of
volatility using a signature volatility model, calibrated on the expected
signature of the volatility. Solving the hedging problem in the calibrated
signature volatility model yields more accurate and stable results across
different payoffs and volatility dynamics.

Abstract: The dual formulation of empirical risk minimization with f-divergence

Conclusion: SDDP框架不仅提升了预测性能，还生成了更具解释性和目标特异性的潜在因子。

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of dimension reduction, tailored to improving
time series forecasting with high-dimensional predictors. We propose a novel
Supervised Deep Dynamic Principal component analysis (SDDP) framework that
incorporates the target variable and lagged observations into the factor
extraction process. Assisted by a temporal neural network, we construct
target-aware predictors by scaling the original predictors in a supervised
manner, with larger weights assigned to predictors with stronger forecasting
power. A principal component analysis is then performed on the target-aware
predictors to extract the estimated SDDP factors. This supervised factor
extraction not only improves predictive accuracy in the downstream forecasting
task but also yields more interpretable and target-specific latent factors.
Building upon SDDP, we propose a factor-augmented nonlinear dynamic forecasting
model that unifies a broad family of factor-model-based forecasting approaches.
To further demonstrate the broader applicability of SDDP, we extend our studies
to a more challenging scenario when the predictors are only partially
observable. We validate the empirical performance of the proposed method on
several real-world public datasets. The results show that our algorithm
achieves notable improvements in forecasting accuracy compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 提出的似然匹配方法在理论和实验上均表现出色，为扩散模型训练提供了新思路。

Abstract: We propose a Likelihood Matching approach for training diffusion models by
first establishing an equivalence between the likelihood of the target data
distribution and a likelihood along the sample path of the reverse diffusion.
To efficiently compute the reverse sample likelihood, a quasi-likelihood is
considered to approximate each reverse transition density by a Gaussian
distribution with matched conditional mean and covariance, respectively. The
score and Hessian functions for the diffusion generation are estimated by
maximizing the quasi-likelihood, ensuring a consistent matching of both the
first two transitional moments between every two time points. A stochastic
sampler is introduced to facilitate computation that leverages on both the
estimated score and Hessian information. We establish consistency of the
quasi-maximum likelihood estimation, and provide non-asymptotic convergence
guarantees for the proposed sampler, quantifying the rates of the approximation
errors due to the score and Hessian estimation, dimensionality, and the number
of diffusion steps. Empirical and simulation evaluations demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed Likelihood Matching and validate the theoretical
results.

consider the extensive-width regime $r \asymp d^\beta$ for $\beta \in [0, 1)$,
and assume a power-law decay on the (non-negative) second-layer coefficients
$\lambda_j\asymp j^{-\alpha}$ for $\alpha \geq 0$. We present a sharp analysis
of the SGD dynamics in the feature learning regime, for both the population
limit and the finite-sample (online) discretization, and derive scaling laws
for the prediction risk that highlight the power-law dependencies on the
optimization time, sample size, and model width. Our analysis combines a
precise characterization of the associated matrix Riccati differential equation
with novel matrix monotonicity arguments to establish convergence guarantees
for the infinite-dimensional effective dynamics.

TL;DR: 提出了一种鲁棒且全面的无信号交叉口车辆协调框架，包括轨迹规划器和状态更新调度器，显著降低碰撞概率并提高资源利用率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究简化了协调系统，忽略了状态不确定性和通信限制带来的驾驶风险。

Method: 结合鲁棒轨迹规划器和上下文感知状态更新调度器，动态控制轨迹分布和状态更新顺序。

Result: 仿真验证了框架的鲁棒性和有效性，显著降低碰撞概率并保持高效协调。

Conclusion: 该框架在不确定和带宽受限条件下表现出优越的协调效率和资源利用能力。

Abstract: Cooperative vehicle coordination at unsignalized intersections has garnered
significant interest from both academia and industry in recent years,
highlighting its notable advantages in improving traffic throughput and fuel
efficiency. However, most existing studies oversimplify the coordination
system, assuming accurate vehicle state information and ideal state update
process. The oversights pose driving risks in the presence of state uncertainty
and communication constraint. To address this gap, we propose a robust and
comprehensive intersection coordination framework consisting of a robust
cooperative trajectory planner and a context-aware status update scheduler. The
trajectory planner directly controls the evolution of the trajectory
distributions during frequent vehicle interactions, thereby offering
probabilistic safety guarantees. To further align with coordination safety in
practical bandwidth-limited conditions, we propose a context-aware status
update scheduler that dynamically prioritizes the state updating order of
vehicles based on their driving urgency. Simulation results validate the
robustness and effectiveness of the proposed coordination framework, showing
that the collision probability can be significantly reduced while maintaining
comparable coordination efficiency to state-of-theart strategies. Moreover, our
proposed framework demonstrates superior effectiveness in utilizing wireless
resources in practical uncertain and bandwidth-limited conditions.

Conclusion: SparksMatter能够生成超越现有知识的化学有效、物理意义明确且具有创造性的无机材料假设。

Abstract: Conventional machine learning approaches accelerate inorganic materials
design via accurate property prediction and targeted material generation, yet
they operate as single-shot models limited by the latent knowledge baked into
their training data. A central challenge lies in creating an intelligent system
capable of autonomously executing the full inorganic materials discovery cycle,
from ideation and planning to experimentation and iterative refinement. We
introduce SparksMatter, a multi-agent AI model for automated inorganic
materials design that addresses user queries by generating ideas, designing and
executing experimental workflows, continuously evaluating and refining results,
and ultimately proposing candidate materials that meet the target objectives.
SparksMatter also critiques and improves its own responses, identifies research
gaps and limitations, and suggests rigorous follow-up validation steps,
including DFT calculations and experimental synthesis and characterization,
embedded in a well-structured final report. The model's performance is
evaluated across case studies in thermoelectrics, semiconductors, and
perovskite oxides materials design. The results demonstrate the capacity of
SparksMatter to generate novel stable inorganic structures that target the
user's needs. Benchmarking against frontier models reveals that SparksMatter
consistently achieves higher scores in relevance, novelty, and scientific
rigor, with a significant improvement in novelty across multiple real-world
design tasks as assessed by a blinded evaluator. These results demonstrate
SparksMatter's unique capacity to generate chemically valid, physically
meaningful, and creative inorganic materials hypotheses beyond existing
materials knowledge.

Motivation: 机器学习原子间势能（MLIPs）的准确原子尺度建模需要可靠的不确定性量化（UQ），但目前仍缺乏有效方法。

Method: 在原子簇扩展框架下研究了集成学习和D最优性两种UQ策略，并提出了聚类增强的局部D最优性方法。

Result: 高精度模型增强了不确定性与误差的相关性，但异构数据集下表现不佳；聚类增强方法显著提高了异构数据集中的新颖性检测能力。

Conclusion: 研究明确了模型保真度和数据异质性对UQ性能的影响，为MLIP开发提供了鲁棒的主动学习和自适应采样策略。

Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) enable accurate atomistic
modelling, but reliable uncertainty quantification (UQ) remains elusive. In
this study, we investigate two UQ strategies, ensemble learning and
D-optimality, within the atomic cluster expansion framework. It is revealed
that higher model accuracy strengthens the correlation between predicted
uncertainties and actual errors and improves novelty detection, with
D-optimality yielding more conservative estimates. Both methods deliver well
calibrated uncertainties on homogeneous training sets, yet they underpredict
errors and exhibit reduced novelty sensitivity on heterogeneous datasets. To
address this limitation, we introduce clustering-enhanced local D-optimality,
which partitions configuration space into clusters during training and applies
D-optimality within each cluster. This approach substantially improves the
detection of novel atomic environments in heterogeneous datasets. Our findings
clarify the roles of model fidelity and data heterogeneity in UQ performance
and provide a practical route to robust active learning and adaptive sampling
strategies for MLIP development.

Motivation: 探讨OSINT在俄乌战争中的作用，区分真实情报与虚假信息，以理解社交媒体上的信息战动态。

Method: 使用2022年1月至2023年7月的200万条推文数据，结合情感分析、党派检测、NER和社区检测技术。

Conclusion: 研究为理解数字战争和虚假信息传播提供了新视角，揭示了OSINT在地缘政治冲突中的应用。

Abstract: This paper examines the role of Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) on Twitter
regarding the Russo-Ukrainian war, distinguishing between genuine OSINT and
deceptive misinformation efforts, termed "BULLSHINT." Utilizing a dataset
spanning from January 2022 to July 2023, we analyze nearly 2 million tweets
from approximately 1,040 users involved in discussing real-time military
engagements, strategic analyses, and misinformation related to the conflict.
Using sentiment analysis, partisanship detection, misinformation
identification, and Named Entity Recognition (NER), we uncover communicative
patterns and dissemination strategies within the OSINT community. Significant
findings reveal a predominant negative sentiment influenced by war events, a
nuanced distribution of pro-Ukrainian and pro-Russian partisanship, and the
potential strategic manipulation of information. Additionally, we apply
community detection techniques, which are able to identify distinct clusters
partisanship, topics, and misinformation, highlighting the complex dynamics of
information spread on social media. This research contributes to the
understanding of digital warfare and misinformation dynamics, offering insights
into the operationalization of OSINT in geopolitical conflicts.

TL;DR: 研究了在线公平分配问题，重点关注PROP1的近似性，发现贪婪算法在自适应对手下无法保证近似性，但在非自适应对手下随机分配有效，且利用MIV预测可提升近似性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典公平性概念（如无嫉妒性和最大最小份额公平性）在线分配中难以近似，因此探索PROP1的近似性。

Method: 分析了贪婪算法在自适应对手下的表现，研究了非自适应对手下的随机分配，并提出了基于MIV预测的算法。

Result: 贪婪算法在自适应对手下失败，随机分配在非自适应对手下有效，MIV预测可提升近似性，但更强公平性概念仍不可近似。

Conclusion: PROP1在特定条件下可近似，但更强公平性概念即使有完美预测仍不可近似。

Abstract: We study the online fair division problem, where indivisible goods arrive
sequentially and must be allocated immediately and irrevocably to agents. Prior
work has established strong impossibility results for approximating classic
fairness notions, such as envy-freeness and maximin share fairness, in this
setting. In contrast, we focus on proportionality up to one good (PROP1), a
natural relaxation of proportionality whose approximability remains unresolved.
We begin by showing that three natural greedy algorithms fail to guarantee any
positive approximation to PROP1 in general, against an adaptive adversary. This
is surprising because greedy algorithms are commonly used in fair division and
a natural greedy algorithm is known to be able to achieve PROP1 under
additional information assumptions. This hardness result motivates the study of
non-adaptive adversaries and the use of side-information, in the spirit of
learning-augmented algorithms. For non-adaptive adversaries, we show that the
simple uniformly random allocation can achieve a meaningful PROP1 approximation
with high probability. Meanwhile, we present an algorithm that obtain robust
approximation ratios against PROP1 when given predictions of the maximum item
value (MIV). Interestingly, we also show that stronger fairness notions such as
EF1, MMS, and PROPX remain inapproximable even with perfect MIV predictions.

Abstract: Despite their success in image classification, modern convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) exhibit fundamental limitations, including data inefficiency,
poor out-of-distribution generalization, and vulnerability to adversarial
perturbations. The primate visual system, in contrast, demonstrates superior
efficiency and robustness, suggesting that its architectural principles may
offer a blueprint for more capable artificial vision systems. This paper
introduces Visual Cortex Network (VCNet), a novel neural network architecture
whose design is informed by the macro-scale organization of the primate visual
cortex. VCNet emulates key biological mechanisms, including hierarchical
processing across distinct cortical areas, dual-stream information segregation,
and top-down predictive feedback. We evaluate VCNet on two specialized
benchmarks: the Spots-10 animal pattern dataset and a light field image
classification task. Our results show that VCNet achieves a classification
accuracy of 92.1\% on Spots-10 and 74.4\% on the light field dataset,
surpassing contemporary models of comparable size. This work demonstrates that
integrating neuroscientific principles into network design can lead to more
efficient and robust models, providing a promising direction for addressing
long-standing challenges in machine learning.

Abstract: The core challenge in automotive exterior design is balancing subjective
aesthetics with objective aerodynamic performance while dramatically
accelerating the development cycle. To address this, we propose a novel,
LLM-driven multi-agent framework that automates the end-to-end workflow from
ambiguous requirements to 3D concept model performance validation. The workflow
is structured in two stages: conceptual generation and performance validation.
In the first stage, agents collaborate to interpret fuzzy design requirements,
generate concept sketches, and produce photorealistic renderings using
diffusion models. In the second stage, the renderings are converted to 3D point
clouds, where a Drag Prediction Agent, built upon a lightweight surrogate
model, provides near-instantaneous predictions of the drag coefficient and
pressure fields, replacing time-consuming CFD simulations. The primary
contribution of this work is the seamless integration of creative generation
with a rapid engineering validation loop within a unified, automated system,
which provides a new paradigm for efficiently balancing creative exploration
with engineering constraints in the earliest stages of design.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的稳定梯度残差（SGR）损失函数，用于优化基于偏微分方程（PDE）的求解器，显著提高了收敛速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的优化方法（如ODIL和PINNs）使用均方误差（MSE）损失函数，导致收敛缓慢，效率低下。

Method: 提出SGR损失函数，通过调整权重参数灵活调节条件数，并在极限情况下退化为MSE损失。

Result: 在ODIL框架中，SGR损失比MSE损失收敛速度快多个数量级；在PINNs框架中，SGR表现也优于MSE。

Conclusion: SGR损失函数在理论和实验上均显著提升了优化求解器的效率，为设计更高效的PDE求解器提供了关键见解。

Abstract: Optimization-based PDE solvers that minimize scalar loss functions have
gained increasing attention in recent years. These methods either define the
loss directly over discrete variables, as in Optimizing a Discrete Loss (ODIL),
or indirectly through a neural network surrogate, as in Physics-Informed Neural
Networks (PINNs). However, despite their promise, such methods often converge
much more slowly than classical iterative solvers and are commonly regarded as
inefficient. This work provides a theoretical insight, attributing the
inefficiency to the use of the mean squared error (MSE) loss, which implicitly
forms the normal equations, squares the condition number, and severely impairs
optimization. To address this, we propose a novel Stabilized Gradient Residual
(SGR) loss. By tuning a weight parameter, it flexibly modulates the condition
number between the original system and its normal equations, while reducing to
the MSE loss in the limiting case. We systematically benchmark the convergence
behavior and optimization stability of the SGR loss within both the ODIL
framework and PINNs-employing either numerical or automatic differentiation-and
compare its performance against classical iterative solvers. Numerical
experiments on a range of benchmark problems demonstrate that, within the ODIL
framework, the proposed SGR loss achieves orders-of-magnitude faster
convergence than the MSE loss. Further validation within the PINNs framework
shows that, despite the high nonlinearity of neural networks, SGR consistently
outperforms the MSE loss. These theoretical and empirical findings help bridge
the performance gap between classical iterative solvers and optimization-based
solvers, highlighting the central role of loss conditioning, and provide key
insights for the design of more efficient PDE solvers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的非确定性限制了其在需要严格程序保真度和可预测执行的结构化环境中的应用。

Method: 采用'Blueprint First, Model Second'哲学，将专家定义的操作程序编码为基于源代码的执行蓝图，由确定性引擎执行，LLM仅用于处理工作流中的复杂子任务。

Result: 在tau-bench基准测试中，Source Code Agent表现优异，平均Pass^1分数比最强基线高出10.1个百分点，同时显著提高了执行效率。

Conclusion: 该框架为严格程序逻辑控制的应用提供了可验证且可靠的自主代理部署方案。

Abstract: While powerful, the inherent non-determinism of large language model (LLM)
agents limits their application in structured operational environments where
procedural fidelity and predictable execution are strict requirements. This
limitation stems from current architectures that conflate probabilistic,
high-level planning with low-level action execution within a single generative
process. To address this, we introduce the Source Code Agent framework, a new
paradigm built on the "Blueprint First, Model Second" philosophy. Our framework
decouples the workflow logic from the generative model. An expert-defined
operational procedure is first codified into a source code-based Execution
Blueprint, which is then executed by a deterministic engine. The LLM is
strategically invoked as a specialized tool to handle bounded, complex
sub-tasks within the workflow, but never to decide the workflow's path. We
conduct a comprehensive evaluation on the challenging tau-bench benchmark,
designed for complex user-tool-rule scenarios. Our results demonstrate that the
Source Code Agent establishes a new state-of-the-art, outperforming the
strongest baseline by 10.1 percentage points on the average Pass^1 score while
dramatically improving execution efficiency. Our work enables the verifiable
and reliable deployment of autonomous agents in applications governed by strict
procedural logic.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的性能分析工具（如分析器）虽然有用，但用户（如软件工程师）需要自行解读复杂的性能数据并关联程序语义，尤其是对非代码作者而言，这一过程具有挑战性，限制了分析工具的适用性。

Method: 研究提出了一种新方法，将性能分析数据（来自Async Profiler）与程序语义（通过微调的CodeBERT模型生成的代码摘要）结合，并在图形用户界面中展示。

Result: 该系统在多个Java基准测试中有效辅助了性能分析，能够更好地理解程序低效问题并提供可操作的优化建议。

Conclusion: 结合性能分析和程序语义的深度学习方法能够显著提升分析工具的实用性，帮助用户更高效地识别和优化程序性能问题。

Abstract: Profiling tools (also known as profilers) play an important role in
understanding program performance at runtime, such as hotspots, bottlenecks,
and inefficiencies. While profilers have been proven to be useful, they give
extra burden to software engineers. Software engineers, as the users, are
responsible to interpret the complex performance data and identify actionable
optimization in program source code. However, it can be challenging for users
to associate inefficiencies with the program semantics, especially if the users
are not the authors of the code, which limits the applicability of profilers.
  In this thesis, we explore a new direction to combine performance profiles
and program semantics with a deep learning approach. The key idea is to glean
code summary for semantic information (at a certain level) and integrate it
into a profiler, which can better understand program inefficiencies for
actionable optimization. To be concrete, we combine profiles generated by Async
Profiler (the state-of-the-art Java profiler) with code summarization from a
fine-tuned CodeBERT-based model. We demonstrate the code summaries of any
selected call path in a graphic user interface. Our system can effectively
assist analysis on many Java benchmarks.

Abstract: Maintaining code quality in large-scale software systems presents significant
challenges, particularly in settings where a large numbers of engineers work
concurrently on a codebase. This paper introduces Code Quality Score (CQS)
system to automatically detect issues with a set of code changes and provide
actionable insights. At its core, the CQS system is powered by two Llama3
models, fine-tuned (with SFT and offline RL approaches), to a) detect common
code quality issues related to coding best practices and b) to provide good
``critiques'' for LLM-generated code review respectively. To maintain good user
experience, we layer the system with hand-crafted rules to filter out incorrect
responses/hallucinations. Offline evaluations show that our CQS system is able
to achieve an impressive precision rate for identifying valid issues. This
system has already been rolled out to developers in an industrial scale setting
and has consistently achieved 60\% week over week user helpfulness rate,
demonstrating its effectiveness in a real-world environment. In this paper, we
present details of the CQS system along with some learnings on curating
developer feedback to create training data for LLM fine-tuning.

TL;DR: REFINE是一个自动化框架，用于评估基于LLM的代码评估器，通过生成逐步降低质量的代码样本和量化评估器配置的排名一致性，提升评估的细粒度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人工评估成本高且主观，而自动化方法难以捕捉代码质量的细微差异，因此需要一种可扩展且精确的评估方法。

Method: REFINE包含两个模块：Hierarchy Dataset Builder生成逐步降低质量的代码样本，Evaluator Tester量化评估器配置的排名一致性。

Result: REFINE在IBM内部工作流中应用，成功将某些代码任务的评估对齐分数从0.7提升至0.9以上。

Conclusion: REFINE提供了一种可控且细粒度的评估方法，支持LLM评估器的优化和模型发布决策。

Abstract: Automation in software engineering increasingly relies on large language
models (LLMs) to generate, review, and assess code artifacts. However,
establishing LLMs as reliable evaluators remains an open challenge: human
evaluations are costly, subjective and non scalable, while existing automated
methods fail to discern fine grained variations in artifact quality.
  We introduce REFINE (Ranking Evaluators for FIne grained Nuanced Evaluation),
an automated framework for benchmarking LLM based evaluators across software
engineering tasks. REFINE comprises of two modules: Hierarchy Dataset Builder
applies novel generation techniques to automatically synthesize artifacts with
progressively reduced quality, and Evaluator Tester quantifies each candidate
evaluator configuration by measuring how closely its rankings align with
expected ordering.
  A key feature of REFINE is controllability: users can tune the granularity of
degradation to progressively refine evaluator configurations, from coarse
filtering to stress testing on subtle quality gaps.
  While the methodology is general, we focus on coding tasks reflecting the
practical demands in our production setting. REFINE was integrated into IBM's
internal development workflows and applied to code generation, translation, and
summarization for COBOL, an enterprise critical programming language, using
industrial data. It was used to identify LLM as a Judge configurations that
lifted alignment scores from below $0.7$ to above $0.9$ in some coding tasks.
These nuance sensitive evaluators are now actively used by model training teams
to support model release decisions.

TL;DR: ToolTrain是一个两阶段工具集成训练框架，通过结合拒绝采样的监督微调和工具集成的强化学习，提升LLM在问题定位中使用检索工具的能力，实验结果显示其性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自然语言问题描述与故障代码之间的语义鸿沟，以及现有LLM代理在多步推理和导航过程中有效利用检索工具的挑战。

Method: 提出ToolTrain框架，结合拒绝采样的监督微调和工具集成的强化学习，训练LLM更好地利用检索工具进行问题定位。

Result: ToolTrain训练的模型在问题定位上达到最先进性能，32B模型甚至超过Claude-3.7，且定位性能提升带来更好的端到端问题解决效果。

Conclusion: ToolTrain证明了通过训练提升问题定位能力是改进自动化软件开发的有效策略。

Abstract: Issue localization, the process of identifying code locations that need
modification to resolve software issues, is a critical yet challenging task in
software development. The semantic gap between natural language issue
descriptions and faulty code requires complex multi-hop reasoning through code
dependencies. Existing LLM-based agents attempt to address this by integrating
repository retrieval tools. However, this transforms issue localization into a
demanding task we call Repo Deep Search, which requires the LLM to effectively
utilize various repository retrieval tools throughout a multi-step reasoning
and navigation process. To tackle this challenge, we present ToolTrain, a
two-stage tool-integrated training framework combining rejection-sampled
supervised fine-tuning and tool-integrated reinforcement learning to enhance
LLMs' ability to use retrieval tools for issue localization. Experimental
results show that ToolTrain-trained models achieve state-of-the-art
performance, with our 32B model even surpassing Claude-3.7 on function-level
localization. The results also show that improved localization performance
translates to better end-to-end issue resolution performance. This further
demonstrates that training for issue localization is a viable and effective
strategy for improving automated software development.

TL;DR: BitsAI-Fix是一种基于大型语言模型（LLMs）的自动化lint错误修复工作流，旨在解决企业代码库中技术债务积累和开发效率低下的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业代码库规模扩大和复杂性增加导致lint错误数量远超工程师手动修复能力，技术债务持续积累，开发效率受阻。

Method: 使用tree-sitter进行上下文扩展，通过专门训练的LLMs生成搜索替换格式补丁，并通过lint扫描重新验证输出最终修复结果。采用渐进式强化学习策略，结合基于规则的奖励机制和代码差异匹配方法。

Result: 在ByteDance的生产部署中，支持5000多名工程师，解决12000多个静态分析问题，修复准确率约85%，每周活跃用户约1000人。

Conclusion: 证明了基于LLM的代码修复解决方案在企业环境中的可行性，并为大规模工业场景中的自动化代码修复提供了参考。

Abstract: As enterprise codebases continue to grow in scale and complexity, the volume
of lint errors far exceeds engineers' manual remediation capacity, leading to
continuous accumulation of technical debt and hindered development efficiency.
This paper presents BitsAI-Fix, an automated lint error remediation workflow
based on Large Language Models (LLMs), designed to address this critical
challenge in industrial-scale environments. BitsAI-Fix employs tree-sitter for
context expansion and generates search-and-replace format patches through
specially trained LLMs, followed by lint scan re-verification to output final
remediation results. Additionally, our approach introduces an innovative
progressive reinforcement learning (RL) training strategy that can
automatically acquire verifiable training data during the project cold-start
phase and continuously iterate the model by collecting online samples through
feedback after system deployment. Furthermore, we designed a targeted
rule-based reward mechanism that combines format rewards and correctness
rewards while penalizing redundant modifications. We also propose a "code diff
matching" methodology to continuously track online effectiveness. In production
deployment at ByteDance, our solution has supported over 5,000 engineers,
resolved more than 12,000 static analysis issues, achieved approximately 85%
remediation accuracy, with around 1,000 weekly active adopters. This work
demonstrates the practical feasibility of LLM-based code remediation solutions
in enterprise environments and serves as a reference for automated code fix in
large-scale industrial scenarios.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种混合代理（MoA）方法，用于在受监管行业中实现高效代码优化，比较了其与遗传算法（GA）和单个LLM的性能，展示了MoA在开源模型中的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受监管行业因隐私和合规限制无法使用商业LLM，需找到一种既能满足合规要求又能高效优化代码的方法。

Method: 采用混合代理（MoA）方法，结合多个专用LLM生成代码，并与GA和单个LLM进行对比实验。

Result: MoA在开源模型中表现优异，节省14.3%至22.2%成本，优化时间缩短28.6%至32.2%。GA在商业模型中更优，但两种集成方法均优于单个LLM。

Conclusion: MoA为受监管行业提供了一种合规且高效的代码优化方案，填补了工业LLM集成评估的空白。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) for code optimization
have enabled industrial platforms to automate software performance engineering
at unprecedented scale and speed. Yet, organizations in regulated industries
face strict constraints on which LLMs they can use - many cannot utilize
commercial models due to data privacy regulations and compliance requirements,
creating a significant challenge for achieving high-quality code optimization
while maintaining cost-effectiveness. We address this by implementing a
Mixture-of-Agents (MoA) approach that directly synthesizes code from multiple
specialized LLMs, comparing it against TurinTech AI's vanilla Genetic Algorithm
(GA)-based ensemble system and individual LLM optimizers using real-world
industrial codebases. Our key contributions include: (1) First MoA application
to industrial code optimization using real-world codebases; (2) Empirical
evidence that MoA excels with open-source models, achieving 14.3% to 22.2% cost
savings and 28.6% to 32.2% faster optimization times for regulated
environments; (3) Deployment guidelines demonstrating GA's advantage with
commercial models while both ensembles outperform individual LLMs; and (4)
Real-world validation across 50 code snippets and seven LLM combinations,
generating over 8,700 variants, addresses gaps in industrial LLM ensemble
evaluation. This provides actionable guidance for organizations balancing
regulatory compliance with optimization performance in production environments.

Abstract: The emergence of agentic AI systems in 6G software businesses presents both
strategic opportunities and significant challenges. While such systems promise
increased autonomy, scalability, and intelligent decision-making across
distributed environments, their adoption raises concerns regarding technical
immaturity, integration complexity, organizational readiness, and
performance-cost trade-offs. In this study, we conducted a preliminary thematic
mapping to identify factors influencing the adoption of agentic software within
the context of 6G. Drawing on a multivocal literature review and targeted
scanning, we identified 29 motivators and 27 demotivators, which were further
categorized into five high-level themes in each group. This thematic mapping
offers a structured overview of the enabling and inhibiting forces shaping
organizational readiness for agentic transformation. Positioned as a
feasibility assessment, the study represents an early phase of a broader
research initiative aimed at developing and validating a layered maturity model
grounded in CMMI model with the software architectural three dimensions
possibly Data, Business Logic, and Presentation. Ultimately, this work seeks to
provide a practical framework to help software-driven organizations assess,
structure, and advance their agent-first capabilities in alignment with the
demands of 6G.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了联合人机推理在机器人任务中的潜力，发现基于置信度的选择策略能提高准确性，但AI的置信度校准是关键。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI辅助任务中，人类操作员常因判断失误未能实现互补性，因此研究联合人机推理以优化决策。

Method: 通过模拟机器人远程操作任务（N=100），研究基于置信度的联合推理策略，并分析AI置信度校准的影响。

Result: 联合推理准确性更高，且受AI置信度校准调节；人类会根据AI推荐调整决策，但校准不佳的AI会损害性能。

Conclusion: AI决策支持系统需具备良好的元认知敏感性，置信度校准是联合人机推理成功的关键。

Abstract: Joint human-AI inference holds immense potential to improve outcomes in
human-supervised robot missions. Current day missions are generally in the
AI-assisted setting, where the human operator makes the final inference based
on the AI recommendation. However, due to failures in human judgement on when
to accept or reject the AI recommendation, complementarity is rarely achieved.
We investigate joint human-AI inference where the inference made with higher
confidence is selected. Through a user study with N=100 participants on a
representative simulated robot teleoperation task, specifically studying the
inference of robots' control delays we show that: a) Joint inference accuracy
is higher and its extent is regulated by the confidence calibration of the AI
agent, and b) Humans change their inferences based on AI recommendations and
the extent and direction of this change is also regulated by the confidence
calibration of the AI agent. Interestingly, our results show that pairing
poorly-calibrated AI-DSS with humans hurts performance instead of helping the
team, reiterating the need for AI-based decision support systems with good
metacognitive sensitivity. To the best of our knowledge, our study presents the
first application of a maximum-confidence-based heuristic for joint human-AI
inference within a simulated robot teleoperation task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着智能设备的普及，情感监测需求增加，但高质量数据和准确标注是AI算法的关键。

Method: 通过75份调查、32次公众访谈和3次焦点小组讨论（12名心理健康专家），开发了AnnoSense框架，并由25名专家评估。

Result: AnnoSense框架在清晰性、实用性和适应性方面得到专家认可。

Conclusion: AnnoSense有望提升真实场景中情感数据的收集与分析，为情感AI研究提供支持。

Abstract: Emotional and mental well-being are vital components of quality of life, and
with the rise of smart devices like smartphones, wearables, and artificial
intelligence (AI), new opportunities for monitoring emotions in everyday
settings have emerged. However, for AI algorithms to be effective, they require
high-quality data and accurate annotations. As the focus shifts towards
collecting emotion data in real-world environments to capture more authentic
emotional experiences, the process of gathering emotion annotations has become
increasingly complex. This work explores the challenges of everyday emotion
data collection from the perspectives of key stakeholders. We collected 75
survey responses, performed 32 interviews with the public, and 3 focus group
discussions (FGDs) with 12 mental health professionals. The insights gained
from a total of 119 stakeholders informed the development of our framework,
AnnoSense, designed to support everyday emotion data collection for AI. This
framework was then evaluated by 25 emotion AI experts for its clarity,
usefulness, and adaptability. Lastly, we discuss the potential next steps and
implications of AnnoSense for future research in emotion AI, highlighting its
potential to enhance the collection and analysis of emotion data in real-world
contexts.

Motivation: 解决用户在对话式LLM中意图与生成代码不对齐的问题，减少澄清回合和挫败感。

Method: 提出直接意图-任务匹配范式，通过NeuroSync工具实现意图、任务及其映射的可视化和编辑。

Result: NeuroSync提高了意图-任务对齐，降低了认知负担，提升了编码效率。

Conclusion: 直接意图-任务匹配范式及其实现工具NeuroSync有效解决了意图与代码不对齐的问题。

Abstract: Conversational LLMs have been widely adopted by domain users with limited
programming experience to solve domain problems. However, these users often
face misalignment between their intent and generated code, resulting in
frustration and rounds of clarification. This work first investigates the cause
of this misalignment, which dues to bidirectional ambiguity: both user intents
and coding tasks are inherently nonlinear, yet must be expressed and
interpreted through linear prompts and code sequences. To address this, we
propose direct intent-task matching, a new human-LLM interaction paradigm that
externalizes and enables direct manipulation of the LLM understanding, i.e.,
the coding tasks and their relationships inferred by the LLM prior to code
generation. As a proof-of-concept, this paradigm is then implemented in
NeuroSync, which employs a knowledge distillation pipeline to extract LLM
understanding, user intents, and their mappings, and enhances the alignment by
allowing users to intuitively inspect and edit them via visualizations. We
evaluate the algorithmic components of NeuroSync via technical experiments, and
assess its overall usability and effectiveness via a user study (N=12). The
results show that it enhances intent-task alignment, lowers cognitive effort,
and improves coding efficiency.

Motivation: 现有研究较少关注用户对心理健康干预的实际接受性，尤其是用户的意愿和能力。

Method: 使用Android应用LogMe收集被动传感器数据和主动情境报告，结合Thompson Sampling算法进行自适应干预。

Result: 被动感知数据显著影响用户对干预的接受性，自适应算法能优化干预时机。

Conclusion: 研究为设计情境感知、自适应的心理健康干预提供了新见解。

Abstract: The rise of mobile health (mHealth) technologies has enabled real-time
monitoring and intervention for mental health conditions using passively sensed
smartphone data. Building on these capabilities, Just-in-Time Adaptive
Interventions (JITAIs) seek to deliver personalized support at opportune
moments, adapting to users' evolving contexts and needs. Although prior
research has examined how context affects user responses to generic
notifications and general mHealth messages, relatively little work has explored
its influence on engagement with actual mental health interventions.
Furthermore, while much of the existing research has focused on detecting when
users might benefit from an intervention, less attention has been paid to
understanding receptivity, i.e., users' willingness and ability to engage with
and act upon the intervention.
  In this study, we investigate user receptivity through two components:
acceptance(acknowledging or engaging with a prompt) and feasibility (ability to
act given situational constraints). We conducted a two-week in-the-wild study
with 70 students using a custom Android app, LogMe, which collected passive
sensor data and active context reports to prompt mental health interventions.
The adaptive intervention module was built using Thompson Sampling, a
reinforcement learning algorithm. We address four research questions relating
smartphone features and self-reported contexts to acceptance and feasibility,
and examine whether an adaptive reinforcement learning approach can optimize
intervention delivery by maximizing a combined receptivity reward. Our results
show that several types of passively sensed data significantly influenced user
receptivity to interventions. Our findings contribute insights into the design
of context-aware, adaptive interventions that are not only timely but also
actionable in real-world settings.

Motivation: 设计过程中时间和资源的限制常阻碍设计师广泛探索和迭代，难以坚持核心设计原则。

Method: 通过15名参与者的形成性研究，开发了集成AI的StoryEnsemble工具，支持多向迭代和灵活导航。

Result: 10名参与者的用户研究表明，StoryEnsemble能实现快速、多方向的迭代和跨设计阶段的灵活导航。

Conclusion: StoryEnsemble展示了AI如何通过新颖交互促进更流畅、易用且有趣的迭代设计实践。

Abstract: Design processes involve exploration, iteration, and movement across
interconnected stages such as persona creation, problem framing, solution
ideation, and prototyping. However, time and resource constraints often hinder
designers from exploring broadly, collecting feedback, and revisiting earlier
assumptions-making it difficult to uphold core design principles in practice.
To better understand these challenges, we conducted a formative study with 15
participants-comprised of UX practitioners, students, and instructors. Based on
the findings, we developed StoryEnsemble, a tool that integrates AI into a
node-link interface and leverages forward and backward propagation to support
dynamic exploration and iteration across the design process. A user study with
10 participants showed that StoryEnsemble enables rapid, multi-directional
iteration and flexible navigation across design stages. This work advances our
understanding of how AI can foster more iterative design practices by
introducing novel interactions that make exploration and iteration more fluid,
accessible, and engaging.

Method: 采用松散耦合架构，结合结构化空间元数据和基于LLM的自然语言处理，最小化平台依赖性。

Result: 在Cluster平台的实验中，Navigation Pixie显著增加了用户的停留时间和自由探索，PC和VR-HMD环境下均表现优异。

Conclusion: 研究推动了VR交互设计，建立了跨平台评估方法，并展示了商业元宇宙平台的实证实验框架。

Abstract: While commercial metaverse platforms offer diverse user-generated content,
they lack effective navigation assistance that can dynamically adapt to users'
interests and intentions. Although previous research has investigated on-demand
agents in controlled environments, implementation in commercial settings with
diverse world configurations and platform constraints remains challenging.
  We present Navigation Pixie, an on-demand navigation agent employing a
loosely coupled architecture that integrates structured spatial metadata with
LLM-based natural language processing while minimizing platform dependencies,
which enables experiments on the extensive user base of commercial metaverse
platforms. Our cross-platform experiments on commercial metaverse platform
Cluster with 99 PC client and 94 VR-HMD participants demonstrated that
Navigation Pixie significantly increased dwell time and free exploration
compared to fixed-route and no-agent conditions across both platforms.
Subjective evaluations revealed consistent on-demand preferences in PC
environments versus context-dependent social perception advantages in VR-HMD.
This research contributes to advancing VR interaction design through
conversational spatial navigation agents, establishes cross-platform evaluation
methodologies revealing environment-dependent effectiveness, and demonstrates
empirical experimentation frameworks for commercial metaverse platforms.

Abstract: Predicting the social and behavioral impact of future technologies, before
they are achieved, would allow us to guide their development and regulation
before these impacts get entrenched. Traditionally, this prediction has relied
on qualitative, narrative methods. Here we describe a method which uses
experimental methods to simulate future technologies, and collect quantitative
measures of the attitudes and behaviors of participants assigned to controlled
variations of the future. We call this method 'science fiction science'. We
suggest that the reason why this method has not been fully embraced yet,
despite its potential benefits, is that experimental scientists may be
reluctant to engage in work facing such serious validity threats as science
fiction science. To address these threats, we consider possible constraints on
the kind of technology that science fiction science may study, as well as the
unconventional, immersive methods that science fiction science may require. We
seek to provide perspective on the reasons why this method has been
marginalized for so long, what benefits it would bring if it could be built on
strong yet unusual methods, and how we can normalize these methods to help the
diverse community of science fiction scientists to engage in a virtuous cycle
of validity improvement.

Conclusion: 需改进实时视频AI的感知能力、干预时机，并解决生态和安全问题，以更好地支持盲人或视障人士。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large multimodal models have provided blind or
visually impaired (BVI) individuals with new capabilities to interpret and
engage with the real world through interactive systems that utilize live video
feeds. However, the potential benefits and challenges of such capabilities to
support diverse real-world assistive tasks remain unclear. In this paper, we
present findings from an exploratory study with eight BVI participants.
Participants used ChatGPT's Advanced Voice with Video, a state-of-the-art live
video AI released in late 2024, in various real-world scenarios, from locating
objects to recognizing visual landmarks, across unfamiliar indoor and outdoor
environments. Our findings indicate that current live video AI effectively
provides guidance and answers for static visual scenes but falls short in
delivering essential live descriptions required in dynamic situations. Despite
inaccuracies in spatial and distance information, participants leveraged the
provided visual information to supplement their mobility strategies. Although
the system was perceived as human-like due to high-quality voice interactions,
assumptions about users' visual abilities, hallucinations, generic responses,
and a tendency towards sycophancy led to confusion, distrust, and potential
risks for BVI users. Based on the results, we discuss implications for
assistive video AI agents, including incorporating additional sensing
capabilities for real-world use, determining appropriate intervention timing
beyond turn-taking interactions, and addressing ecological and safety concerns.

Result: 发现认知角色是动态且情境依赖的，提出了五种关系类型及其特征。

Conclusion: 呼吁采用更细致的框架理解人机知识共建，丰富HCI对AI使用的认知维度。

Abstract: As AI systems become integral to knowledge-intensive work, questions arise
not only about their functionality but also their epistemic roles in human-AI
interaction. While HCI research has proposed various AI role typologies, it
often overlooks how AI reshapes users' roles as knowledge contributors. This
study examines how users form epistemic relationships with AI-how they assess,
trust, and collaborate with it in research and teaching contexts. Based on 31
interviews with academics across disciplines, we developed a five-part codebook
and identified five relationship types: Instrumental Reliance, Contingent
Delegation, Co-agency Collaboration, Authority Displacement, and Epistemic
Abstention. These reflect variations in trust, assessment modes, tasks, and
human epistemic status. Our findings show that epistemic roles are dynamic and
context-dependent. We argue for shifting beyond static metaphors of AI toward a
more nuanced framework that captures how humans and AI co-construct knowledge,
enriching HCI's understanding of the relational and normative dimensions of AI
use.

detection. However, most endeavors on image translation primarily focus on the
pixel-level and morphology-level statistics of galaxy images. There is a lack
of discussion on the preservation of complex high-order galaxy physical
information, which would be more challenging but crucial for studies that rely
on high-fidelity image translation. Therefore, we investigated the
effectiveness of generative models in preserving high-order physical
information (represented by spectroscopic redshift) along with pixel-level and
morphology-level information. We tested four representative models, i.e. a Swin
Transformer, an SRGAN, a capsule network, and a diffusion model, using the SDSS
and CFHTLS galaxy images. We found that these models show different levels of
incapabilities in retaining redshift information, even if the global structures
of galaxies and morphology-level statistics can be roughly reproduced. In
particular, the cross-band peak fluxes of galaxies were found to contain
meaningful redshift information, whereas they are subject to noticeable
uncertainties in the translation of images, which may substantially be due to
the nature of many-to-many mapping. Nonetheless, imperfect translated images
may still contain a considerable amount of information and thus hold promise
for downstream applications for which high image fidelity is not strongly
required. Our work can facilitate further research on how complex physical
information is manifested on galaxy images, and it provides implications on the
development of image translation models for scientific use.

*Wei Li,Limei Hu,Feng Chen,Ye Yao*

TL;DR: 提出一种低通信的弹性分布式估计算法，通过信誉节点选择和W-SVDD模型增强抗攻击能力，减少无效更新。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多任务对抗网络中因节点或链路受攻击导致的参数估计不准确问题。

Method: 采用信誉节点选择策略和W-SVDD模型训练数据，引入事件触发机制减少无效更新。

Result: 仿真显示算法在减少通信成本的同时性能优于其他算法。

Conclusion: 该算法有效提升分布式估计的弹性和效率。

Abstract: In multi-task adversarial networks, the accurate estimation of unknown
parameters in a distributed algorithm is hindered by attacked nodes or links.
To tackle this challenge, this brief proposes a low-communication resilient
distributed estimation algorithm. First, a node selection strategy based on
reputation is introduced that allows nodes to communicate with more reliable
subset of neighbors. Subsequently, to discern trustworthy intermediate
estimates, the Weighted Support Vector Data Description (W-SVDD) model is
employed to train the memory data. This trained model contributes to reinforce
the resilience of the distributed estimation process against the impact of
attacked nodes or links. Additionally, an event-triggered mechanism is
introduced to minimize ineffective updates to the W-SVDD model, and a suitable
threshold is derived based on assumptions. The convergence of the algorithm is
analyzed. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm
achieves superior performance with less communication cost compared to other
algorithms.

### [445] [Block: Balancing Load in LLM Serving with Context, Knowledge and Predictive Scheduling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03611)
*Wei Da,Evangelia Kalyvianaki*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Block是一个分布式调度框架，通过利用请求的上下文信息优化大型语言模型服务中的负载均衡和自动配置，显著提升性能和降低延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型服务系统依赖单一且启发式的任务调度器，无法高效处理大规模语言模型服务的负载均衡和自动配置需求。

Method: Block采用分布式、无状态和预测性调度方法，利用LLM推理的确定性特征（如主机配置、响应长度和硬件性能）进行决策。

Result: 在12个GPU集群上的评估显示，Block比启发式调度器提升服务容量16.7%，降低P99尾延迟49.5%。

Conclusion: Block在多样化模型、工作负载和配置下均表现优异，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: This paper presents Block, a distributed scheduling framework designed to
optimize load balancing and auto-provisioning across instances in large
language model serving frameworks by leveraging contextual information from
incoming requests. Unlike popular model serving systems that rely on monolithic
and heuristic task schedulers, Block operates as a fully distributed,
stateless, and predictive scheduling system to achieve low overhead,
reliability, and scalability. It leverages the deterministic and predictable
characteristics of LLM inferences, such as host configurations, response
lengths, and hardware performance, to make scheduling decisions based on
accurately predicted metrics. Evaluation on a 12 GPUs cluster shows that Block
significantly outperforms heuristic schedulers, boosting serving capacity by up
to 16.7\% and reducing P99 tail latency by up to 49.5\%. These performance
gains remain consistent across diverse models, workloads and configurations.
Code and data are open-sourced.

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型（LLMs）在文献推荐中存在性别偏见，表现为偏好男性作者和多数群体，且偏见在更大候选池中加剧。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在文献推荐中是否引入人口统计偏见，特别是性别偏见。

Method: 通过控制实验，使用假名作者名，评估多种LLMs（如GPT-4o、Claude Sonnet等）在不同性别组成的候选池中的选择模式。

Result: 发现LLMs存在两种偏见：偏好男性作者和多数群体，且偏见在更大候选池中更明显。社会科学领域偏见最小。

Conclusion: LLMs可能加剧学术引用中的性别不平等，需开发有效缓解策略。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly being adopted as research
assistants, particularly for literature review and reference recommendation,
yet little is known about whether they introduce demographic bias into citation
workflows. This study systematically investigates gender bias in LLM-driven
reference selection using controlled experiments with pseudonymous author
names. We evaluate several LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Claude Sonnet, and Claude
Haiku) by varying gender composition within candidate reference pools and
analyzing selection patterns across fields. Our results reveal two forms of
bias: a persistent preference for male-authored references and a majority-group
bias that favors whichever gender is more prevalent in the candidate pool.
These biases are amplified in larger candidate pools and only modestly
attenuated by prompt-based mitigation strategies. Field-level analysis
indicates that bias magnitude varies across scientific domains, with social
sciences showing the least bias. Our findings indicate that LLMs can reinforce
or exacerbate existing gender imbalances in scholarly recognition. Effective
mitigation strategies are needed to avoid perpetuating existing gender
disparities in scientific citation practices before integrating LLMs into
high-stakes academic workflows.

TL;DR: READ框架首次实现了基于扩散-Transformer的实时说话头部生成，通过压缩视频和语音潜在空间及异步噪声调度器，显著提升生成速度和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在说话头部生成中取得了进展，但推理速度过慢限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出READ框架，包括时间VAE压缩视频潜在空间、SpeechAE生成语音潜在代码，以及A2V-DiT模型和异步噪声调度器（ANS）。

Result: READ在生成质量和速度上优于现有方法，尤其在长时间生成中保持稳定性。

Conclusion: READ在质量和速度间取得了平衡，为实时说话头部生成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The introduction of diffusion models has brought significant advances to the
field of audio-driven talking head generation. However, the extremely slow
inference speed severely limits the practical implementation of diffusion-based
talking head generation models. In this study, we propose READ, the first
real-time diffusion-transformer-based talking head generation framework. Our
approach first learns a spatiotemporal highly compressed video latent space via
a temporal VAE, significantly reducing the token count to accelerate
generation. To achieve better audio-visual alignment within this compressed
latent space, a pre-trained Speech Autoencoder (SpeechAE) is proposed to
generate temporally compressed speech latent codes corresponding to the video
latent space. These latent representations are then modeled by a carefully
designed Audio-to-Video Diffusion Transformer (A2V-DiT) backbone for efficient
talking head synthesis. Furthermore, to ensure temporal consistency and
accelerated inference in extended generation, we propose a novel asynchronous
noise scheduler (ANS) for both the training and inference process of our
framework. The ANS leverages asynchronous add-noise and asynchronous
motion-guided generation in the latent space, ensuring consistency in generated
video clips. Experimental results demonstrate that READ outperforms
state-of-the-art methods by generating competitive talking head videos with
significantly reduced runtime, achieving an optimal balance between quality and
speed while maintaining robust metric stability in long-time generation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于AI和大语言模型的可扩展框架，用于从学生反馈中提取可操作的主题，支持大规模教学效果评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模大学（尤其是工程类项目）在评估教学效果时面临传统方法（如手动审查学生评价）不切实际的问题，导致数据使用不一致和洞察被忽视。

Method: 采用分层总结、匿名化和异常处理的AI框架，结合可视化分析（如百分位比较和历史趋势），从开放式评论中提取主题。

Result: 初步验证表明，LLM生成的总结能可靠支持形成性评估和专业发展，已在工程学院成功部署。

Conclusion: 研究表明，透明设计和共享治理的AI系统能促进教学卓越和大规模持续改进。

Abstract: Evaluating teaching effectiveness at scale remains a persistent challenge for
large universities, particularly within engineering programs that enroll tens
of thousands of students. Traditional methods, such as manual review of student
evaluations, are often impractical, leading to overlooked insights and
inconsistent data use. This article presents a scalable, AI-supported framework
for synthesizing qualitative student feedback using large language models. The
system employs hierarchical summarization, anonymization, and exception
handling to extract actionable themes from open-ended comments while upholding
ethical safeguards. Visual analytics contextualize numeric scores through
percentile-based comparisons, historical trends, and instructional load. The
approach supports meaningful evaluation and aligns with best practices in
qualitative analysis and educational assessment, incorporating student, peer,
and self-reflective inputs without automating personnel decisions. We report on
its successful deployment across a large college of engineering. Preliminary
validation through comparisons with human reviewers, faculty feedback, and
longitudinal analysis suggests that LLM-generated summaries can reliably
support formative evaluation and professional development. This work
demonstrates how AI systems, when designed with transparency and shared
governance, can promote teaching excellence and continuous improvement at scale
within academic institutions.

Result: 揭示了标准化与AI结合对市场效率、专业实践和系统性风险的影响，提出了四项关键贡献。

Conclusion: 成功的转型需要技术与专业知识的结合，构建能增强而非替代人类专家的系统。

Abstract: The Uniform Appraisal Dataset (UAD) 3.6's mandatory 2026 implementation
transforms residential property valuation from narrative reporting to
structured, machine-readable formats. This paper provides the first
comprehensive analysis of this regulatory shift alongside concurrent AI
advances in computer vision, natural language processing, and autonomous
systems. We develop a three-layer framework for AI-augmented valuation
addressing technical implementation and institutional trust requirements. Our
analysis reveals how regulatory standardization converging with AI capabilities
enables fundamental market restructuring with profound implications for
professional practice, efficiency, and systemic risk. We make four key
contributions: (1) documenting institutional failures including inter-appraiser
variability and systematic biases undermining valuation reliability; (2)
developing an architectural framework spanning physical data acquisition,
semantic understanding, and cognitive reasoning that integrates emerging
technologies while maintaining professional oversight; (3) addressing trust
requirements for high-stakes financial applications including regulatory
compliance, algorithmic fairness, and uncertainty quantification; (4) proposing
evaluation methodologies beyond generic AI benchmarks toward domain-specific
protocols. Our findings indicate successful transformation requires not merely
technological sophistication but careful human-AI collaboration, creating
systems that augment rather than replace professional expertise while
addressing historical biases and information asymmetries in real estate
markets.

Motivation: 法律系统中法官的直觉可能与广泛社会观点不一致，研究试图通过LLMs预测人类合理性判断。

Method: 通过随机对照试验，比较人类和模型在多个法律背景下的10,000多次模拟判断。

Result: 某些模型能捕捉决策架构，优先社会线索而非经济效率，与人类行为一致。

Conclusion: 研究结果可用于法官校准直觉、立法者测试政策解释，以及资源有限诉讼者预览论点接受度，同时强调理解AI内部伦理框架的重要性。

Abstract: In everyday life, people make countless reasonableness judgments that
determine appropriate behavior in various contexts. Predicting these judgments
challenges the legal system, as judges' intuitions may not align with broader
societal views. This Article investigates whether large language models (LLMs)
can learn to identify patterns driving human reasonableness judgments.
  Using randomized controlled trials comparing humans and models across
multiple legal contexts with over 10,000 simulated judgments, we demonstrate
that certain models capture not just surface-level responses but potentially
their underlying decisional architecture. Strikingly, these systems prioritize
social cues over economic efficiency in negligence determinations, mirroring
human behavior despite contradicting textbook treatments.
  These findings suggest practical applications: judges could calibrate
intuitions against broader patterns, lawmakers could test policy
interpretations, and resource-constrained litigants could preview argument
reception. As AI agents increasingly make autonomous real-world decisions,
understanding whether they've internalized recognizable ethical frameworks
becomes essential for anticipating their behavior.

Abstract: The convergence of Web3 technologies and AI agents represents a rapidly
evolving frontier poised to reshape decentralized ecosystems. This paper
presents the first and most comprehensive analysis of the intersection between
Web3 and AI agents, examining five critical dimensions: landscape, economics,
governance, security, and trust mechanisms. Through an analysis of 133 existing
projects, we first develop a taxonomy and systematically map the current market
landscape (RQ1), identifying distinct patterns in project distribution and
capitalization. Building upon these findings, we further investigate four key
integrations: (1) the role of AI agents in participating in and optimizing
decentralized finance (RQ2); (2) their contribution to enhancing Web3
governance mechanisms (RQ3); (3) their capacity to strengthen Web3 security via
intelligent vulnerability detection and automated smart contract auditing
(RQ4); and (4) the establishment of robust reliability frameworks for AI agent
operations leveraging Web3's inherent trust infrastructure (RQ5). By
synthesizing these dimensions, we identify key integration patterns, highlight
foundational challenges related to scalability, security, and ethics, and
outline critical considerations for future research toward building robust,
intelligent, and trustworthy decentralized systems with effective AI agent
interactions.

Result: 提出了一个原型框架，旨在为政策制定提供工具，系统评估AI的社会影响。

Conclusion: 该框架是迈向将自由概念操作化的重要一步，为AI监管提供了新的视角。

Abstract: In the discourse on AI regulation, 'responsible AI' is the dominant paradigm,
with the focus on mitigating the risks related to AI systems. While this focus
is important and necessary, it has limited use for a systematic consideration
of AI's societal impact. This paper proposes a proto-framework for assessing
the societal impact of AI systems by operationalising the concept of freedom.
This proto-framework is intended as a step towards a fully operationalised
framework to be used in policymaking contexts. By drawing on Kantian philosophy
and related contemporary interpretations, freedom is developed as the
counterpart to the concept of responsibility. Two dimensions of freedom are
developed in further detail: freedom as capability and freedom as opportunity.
These two dimensions of freedom are then applied in a proto-framework that
systematically considers AI's impact on society using the Sustainable
Development Goals. This proto-framework aims to complement current risk-based
approaches and thereby offers a first step towards operationalising the concept
of freedom in AI regulation.

Abstract: Corporate credit rating serves as a crucial intermediary service in the
market economy, playing a key role in maintaining economic order. Existing
credit rating models rely on financial metrics and deep learning. However, they
often overlook insights from non-financial data, such as corporate annual
reports. To address this, this paper introduces a corporate credit rating
framework that integrates financial data with features extracted from annual
reports using FinBERT, aiming to fully leverage the potential value of
unstructured text data. In addition, we have developed a large-scale dataset,
the Comprehensive Corporate Rating Dataset (CCRD), which combines both
traditional financial data and textual data from annual reports. The
experimental results show that the proposed method improves the accuracy of the
rating predictions by 8-12%, significantly improving the effectiveness and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列基础模型（TSFMs）在金融K线数据上表现不佳，且忽略了关键的下游任务（如波动率预测和合成数据生成）。Kronos旨在解决这些局限性。

Method: Kronos引入了一个特殊的分词器，将连续市场信息离散化为标记序列，并在45个全球交易所的120亿条K线记录上进行自回归预训练。

Result: Kronos在零样本设置下表现出色，价格序列预测RankIC提升93%，波动率预测MAE降低9%，合成K线序列生成保真度提高22%。

Conclusion: Kronos是一个强大且多功能的基础模型，适用于端到端金融时间序列分析，其预训练模型已公开。

Abstract: The success of large-scale pre-training paradigm, exemplified by Large
Language Models (LLMs), has inspired the development of Time Series Foundation
Models (TSFMs). However, their application to financial candlestick (K-line)
data remains limited, often underperforming non-pre-trained architectures.
Moreover, existing TSFMs often overlook crucial downstream tasks such as
volatility prediction and synthetic data generation. To address these
limitations, we propose Kronos, a unified, scalable pre-training framework
tailored to financial K-line modeling. Kronos introduces a specialized
tokenizer that discretizes continuous market information into token sequences,
preserving both price dynamics and trade activity patterns. We pre-train Kronos
using an autoregressive objective on a massive, multi-market corpus of over 12
billion K-line records from 45 global exchanges, enabling it to learn nuanced
temporal and cross-asset representations. Kronos excels in a zero-shot setting
across a diverse set of financial tasks. On benchmark datasets, Kronos boosts
price series forecasting RankIC by 93% over the leading TSFM and 87% over the
best non-pre-trained baseline. It also achieves a 9% lower MAE in volatility
forecasting and a 22% improvement in generative fidelity for synthetic K-line
sequences. These results establish Kronos as a robust, versatile foundation
model for end-to-end financial time series analysis. Our pre-trained model is
publicly available at https://github.com/shiyu-coder/Kronos.

Motivation: 加密货币市场的24/7交易、极端波动性和快速变化使得现有时间序列生成方法不适用，亟需专门解决方案。

Method: 提出CTBench，包含开源数据集和13个评估指标，涵盖预测准确性、交易性能等5个维度，并采用双任务评估框架。

Result: 评估了8种代表性模型，揭示了统计保真度与实际盈利能力之间的权衡，并提供模型选择和部署的实用建议。

Conclusion: CTBench为加密货币分析和策略开发提供了首个全面基准，填补了领域空白。

Abstract: Synthetic time series are essential tools for data augmentation, stress
testing, and algorithmic prototyping in quantitative finance. However, in
cryptocurrency markets, characterized by 24/7 trading, extreme volatility, and
rapid regime shifts, existing Time Series Generation (TSG) methods and
benchmarks often fall short, jeopardizing practical utility. Most prior work
(1) targets non-financial or traditional financial domains, (2) focuses
narrowly on classification and forecasting while neglecting crypto-specific
complexities, and (3) lacks critical financial evaluations, particularly for
trading applications. To address these gaps, we introduce \textsf{CTBench}, the
first comprehensive TSG benchmark tailored for the cryptocurrency domain.
\textsf{CTBench} curates an open-source dataset from 452 tokens and evaluates
TSG models across 13 metrics spanning 5 key dimensions: forecasting accuracy,
rank fidelity, trading performance, risk assessment, and computational
efficiency. A key innovation is a dual-task evaluation framework: (1) the
\emph{Predictive Utility} task measures how well synthetic data preserves
temporal and cross-sectional patterns for forecasting, while (2) the
\emph{Statistical Arbitrage} task assesses whether reconstructed series support
mean-reverting signals for trading. We benchmark eight representative models
from five methodological families over four distinct market regimes, uncovering
trade-offs between statistical fidelity and real-world profitability. Notably,
\textsf{CTBench} offers model ranking analysis and actionable guidance for
selecting and deploying TSG models in crypto analytics and strategy
development.

Method: 研究在28个Curve Finance池的一年历史数据上，评估了XGBoost、随机森林、LSTM、Transformer、量子神经网络（QNN）和量子支持向量机（QSVM-QNN）的性能。

Result: 经典集成模型表现最佳，XGBoost方向准确率最高（71.57%），随机森林测试MAE最低（1.77）。量子模型表现较差，准确率低于50%。

Conclusion: 经典方法在DeFi应用中优于量子方法，为实际应用提供了实用参考。

Abstract: The rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) has created a growing demand for
accurate yield and performance forecasting to guide liquidity allocation
strategies. In this study, we benchmark six models, XGBoost, Random Forest,
LSTM, Transformer, quantum neural networks (QNN), and quantum support vector
machines with quantum feature maps (QSVM-QNN), on one year of historical data
from 28 Curve Finance pools. We evaluate model performance on test MAE, RMSE,
and directional accuracy. Our results show that classical ensemble models,
particularly XGBoost and Random Forest, consistently outperform both deep
learning and quantum models. XGBoost achieves the highest directional accuracy
(71.57%) with a test MAE of 1.80, while Random Forest attains the lowest test
MAE of 1.77 and 71.36% accuracy. In contrast, quantum models underperform with
directional accuracy below 50% and higher errors, highlighting current
limitations in applying quantum machine learning to real-world DeFi time series
data. This work offers a reproducible benchmark and practical insights into
model suitability for DeFi applications, emphasizing the robustness of
classical methods over emerging quantum approaches in this domain.

Motivation: 现实应用中数据可用性随时间变化，而传统迁移学习方法基于静态假设，导致评估不切实际。

Result: 框架能模拟多种实验变体，提供算法在动态环境中的潜在行为信息。

Conclusion: 框架有助于理解模型行为，支持实际部署时的决策。

Abstract: When the available data for a target domain is limited, transfer learning
(TL) methods can be used to develop models on related data-rich domains, before
deploying them on the target domain. However, these TL methods are typically
designed with specific, static assumptions on the amount of available labeled
and unlabeled target data. This is in contrast with many real world
applications, where the availability of data and corresponding labels varies
over time. Since the evaluation of the TL methods is typically also performed
under the same static data availability assumptions, this would lead to
unrealistic expectations concerning their performance in real world settings.
To support a more realistic evaluation and comparison of TL algorithms and
models, we propose a data manipulation framework that (1) simulates varying
data availability scenarios over time, (2) creates multiple domains through
resampling of a given dataset and (3) introduces inter-domain variability by
applying realistic domain transformations, e.g., creating a variety of
potentially time-dependent covariate and concept shifts. These capabilities
enable simulation of a large number of realistic variants of the experiments,
in turn providing more information about the potential behavior of algorithms
when deployed in dynamic settings. We demonstrate the usefulness of the
proposed framework by performing a case study on a proprietary real-world suite
of card payment datasets. Given the confidential nature of the case study, we
also illustrate the use of the framework on the publicly available Bank Account
Fraud (BAF) dataset. By providing a methodology for evaluating TL methods over
time and in realistic data availability scenarios, our framework facilitates
understanding of the behavior of models and algorithms. This leads to better
decision making when deploying models for new domains in real-world
environments.

### [459] [Generating Light-based Fingerprints for Indoor Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03011)
*Hsun-Yu Lee,Jie Lin,Fang-Jing Wu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于可见光通信（VLC）的室内定位方法，通过低成本AS7341传感器捕获光谱特征作为定位指纹，并利用TabGAN生成合成数据增强训练集，显著降低了定位误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有射频定位技术（如Wi-Fi、RFID、UWB）易受多径衰落、干扰和覆盖变化影响，需要更稳健的解决方案。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：1）用真实光谱数据训练多层感知机（MLP）；2）用TabGAN生成合成数据扩充训练集。

Result: 合成数据将平均定位误差从62.9厘米降至49.3厘米（提升20%），仅需额外5%的数据收集成本。

Conclusion: GAN数据增强有效缓解数据稀缺问题，提升模型泛化能力，验证了VLC定位的可行性。

Abstract: Accurate indoor localization underpins applications ranging from wayfinding
and emergency response to asset tracking and smart-building services.
Radio-frequency solutions (e.g. Wi-Fi, RFID, UWB) are widely adopted but remain
vulnerable to multipath fading, interference, and uncontrollable coverage
variation. We explore an orthogonal modality -- visible light communication
(VLC) -- and demonstrate that the spectral signatures captured by a low-cost
AS7341 sensor can serve as robust location fingerprints.
  We introduce a two-stage framework that (i) trains a multi-layer perceptron
(MLP) on real spectral measurements and (ii) enlarges the training corpus with
synthetic samples produced by TabGAN. The augmented dataset reduces the mean
localization error from 62.9cm to 49.3cm -- a 20% improvement -- while
requiring only 5% additional data-collection effort. Experimental results
obtained on 42 reference points in a U-shaped laboratory confirm that GAN-based
augmentation mitigates data-scarcity issues and enhances generalization.

### [460] [Can Large Language Models Identify Materials from Radar Signals?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03120)
*Jiangyou Zhu,Hongyu Deng,He Chen*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: LLMaterial利用预训练大语言模型（LLM）直接从雷达信号中推断材料组成，通过物理信号处理和检索增强生成策略，实现开放集材料识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于雷达的材料识别方法局限于封闭集对象，且需任务特定数据训练，限制了实际应用。研究探索是否可利用LLM直接从雷达信号推断材料组成。

Method: 1. 引入物理信号处理管道，将高冗余雷达数据压缩为紧凑中间参数；2. 采用检索增强生成（RAG）策略，为LLM提供领域知识，使其能解释中间参数。

Result: 初步结果显示，LLMaterial能有效区分多种常见材料，展现出实际应用的潜力。

Conclusion: LLMaterial为开放集材料识别提供了新方法，结合LLM的推理能力与雷达信号处理，具有实际应用前景。

Abstract: Accurately identifying the material composition of objects is a critical
capability for AI robots powered by large language models (LLMs) to perform
context-aware manipulation. Radar technologies offer a promising sensing
modality for material recognition task. When combined with deep learning, radar
technologies have demonstrated strong potential in identifying the material of
various objects. However, existing radar-based solutions are often constrained
to closed-set object categories and typically require task-specific data
collection to train deep learning models, largely limiting their practical
applicability. This raises an important question: Can we leverage the powerful
reasoning capabilities of pre-trained LLMs to directly infer material
composition from raw radar signals? Answering this question is non-trivial due
to the inherent redundancy of radar signals and the fact that pre-trained LLMs
have no prior exposure to raw radar data during training. To address this, we
introduce LLMaterial, the first study to investigate the feasibility of using
LLM to identify materials directly from radar signals. First, we introduce a
physics-informed signal processing pipeline that distills high-redundancy radar
raw data into a set of compact intermediate parameters that encapsulate the
material's intrinsic characteristics. Second, we adopt a retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) strategy to provide the LLM with domain-specific knowledge,
enabling it to interpret and reason over the extracted intermediate parameters.
Leveraging this integration, the LLM is empowered to perform step-by-step
reasoning on the condensed radar features, achieving open-set material
recognition directly from raw radar signals. Preliminary results show that
LLMaterial can effectively distinguish among a variety of common materials,
highlighting its strong potential for real-world material identification
applications.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于单导联心电图的高效睡眠呼吸暂停亚型分类方法，适用于可穿戴设备。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 睡眠呼吸暂停的准确分类对治疗至关重要，但现有方法难以满足可穿戴设备的实时性和能效需求。

Result: SleepLiteCNN准确率超95%，宏F1分数92%，单次推理仅需1.8微焦耳，FPGA验证硬件资源占用低。

Conclusion: SleepLiteCNN适合可穿戴设备，能高效实时监测睡眠呼吸暂停亚型。

Abstract: Apnea is a common sleep disorder characterized by breathing interruptions
lasting at least ten seconds and occurring more than five times per hour.
Accurate, high-temporal-resolution detection of sleep apnea subtypes -
Obstructive, Central, and Mixed - is crucial for effective treatment and
management. This paper presents an energy-efficient method for classifying
these subtypes using a single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) with high temporal
resolution to address the real-time needs of wearable devices. We evaluate a
wide range of classical machine learning algorithms and deep learning
architectures on 1-second ECG windows, comparing their accuracy, complexity,
and energy consumption. Based on this analysis, we introduce SleepLiteCNN, a
compact and energy-efficient convolutional neural network specifically designed
for wearable platforms. SleepLiteCNN achieves over 95% accuracy and a 92%
macro-F1 score, while requiring just 1.8 microjoules per inference after 8-bit
quantization. Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) synthesis further
demonstrates significant reductions in hardware resource usage, confirming its
suitability for continuous, real-time monitoring in energy-constrained
environments. These results establish SleepLiteCNN as a practical and effective
solution for wearable device sleep apnea subtype detection.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Veli是一种无监督贝叶斯模型，通过变分推理校正低成本传感器的空气质量读数，无需参考站共置，并引入了AQ-SDR作为最大的空气质量传感器基准数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市空气污染是重大健康危机，需要准确且可扩展的空气质量监测方法。低成本传感器虽具扩展性，但受漂移、校准误差和环境干扰影响。

Method: Veli利用变分推理构建解耦表示，分离真实污染物读数与传感器噪声，无需参考站共置。同时，引入AQ-SDR作为标准化基准数据集。

Result: Veli在分布内外均表现出强泛化能力，有效处理传感器漂移和异常行为。AQ-SDR包含23,737个传感器和参考站的读数。

Conclusion: Veli解决了低成本传感器监测的主要部署障碍，为空气质量监测提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Urban air pollution is a major health crisis causing millions of premature
deaths annually, underscoring the urgent need for accurate and scalable
monitoring of air quality (AQ). While low-cost sensors (LCS) offer a scalable
alternative to expensive reference-grade stations, their readings are affected
by drift, calibration errors, and environmental interference. To address these
challenges, we introduce Veli (Reference-free Variational Estimation via Latent
Inference), an unsupervised Bayesian model that leverages variational inference
to correct LCS readings without requiring co-location with reference stations,
eliminating a major deployment barrier. Specifically, Veli constructs a
disentangled representation of the LCS readings, effectively separating the
true pollutant reading from the sensor noise. To build our model and address
the lack of standardized benchmarks in AQ monitoring, we also introduce the Air
Quality Sensor Data Repository (AQ-SDR). AQ-SDR is the largest AQ sensor
benchmark to date, with readings from 23,737 LCS and reference stations across
multiple regions. Veli demonstrates strong generalization across both
in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings, effectively handling sensor
drift and erratic sensor behavior. Code for model and dataset will be made
public when this paper is published.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SpectrumFM的频谱基础模型，通过创新的频谱编码器和自监督学习任务，显著提升了频谱认知的泛化能力和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有频谱认知方法在多样化的频谱环境和任务中泛化能力有限且准确性不足，亟需一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 采用卷积神经网络和多头自注意力机制的频谱编码器，结合掩码重建和下一时隙信号预测的自监督学习任务进行预训练，并利用LoRA参数高效微调适应下游任务。

Result: 在频谱感知、异常检测和无线技术分类任务中，SpectrumFM显著优于现有方法，检测概率提升30%，AUC提升10%，分类准确率提高9.6%。

Conclusion: SpectrumFM为频谱认知提供了新范式，具有强大的泛化能力和适应性，适用于多种频谱任务。

Abstract: The enhancement of spectrum efficiency and the realization of secure spectrum
utilization are critically dependent on spectrum cognition. However, existing
spectrum cognition methods often exhibit limited generalization and suboptimal
accuracy when deployed across diverse spectrum environments and tasks. To
overcome these challenges, we propose a spectrum foundation model, termed
SpectrumFM, which provides a new paradigm for spectrum cognition. An innovative
spectrum encoder that exploits the convolutional neural networks and the
multi-head self attention mechanisms is proposed to effectively capture both
fine-grained local signal structures and high-level global dependencies in the
spectrum data. To enhance its adaptability, two novel self-supervised learning
tasks, namely masked reconstruction and next-slot signal prediction, are
developed for pre-training SpectrumFM, enabling the model to learn rich and
transferable representations. Furthermore, low-rank adaptation (LoRA)
parameter-efficient fine-tuning is exploited to enable SpectrumFM to seamlessly
adapt to various downstream spectrum cognition tasks, including spectrum
sensing (SS), anomaly detection (AD), and wireless technology classification
(WTC). Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of SpectrumFM over
state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, it improves detection probability in
the SS task by 30% at -4 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), boosts the area under
the curve (AUC) in the AD task by over 10%, and enhances WTC accuracy by 9.6%.

Conclusion: 证明了使用标准Wi-Fi硬件无需修改即可实现高精度传感的可行性。

Abstract: This paper presents, for the first time, a method to extract both range and
Doppler information from commercial Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI) using
a monostatic (single transceiver) setup. Utilizing the CSI phase in Wi-Fi
sensing from a Network Interface Card (NIC) not designed for full-duplex
operation is challenging due to (1) Hardware asynchronization, which introduces
significant phase errors, and (2) Proximity of transmit (Tx) and receive (Rx)
antennas, which creates strong coupling that overwhelms the motion signal of
interest. We propose a new signal processing approach that addresses both
challenges via three key innovations: Time offset cancellation, Phase alignment
correction, and Tx/Rx coupling mitigation. Our method achieves cm-level
accuracy in range and Doppler estimation for moving targets, validated using a
commercial Intel Wi-Fi AX211 NIC. Our results show successful detection and
tracking of moving objects in realistic environments, establishing the
feasibility of high-precision sensing using standard Wi-Fi packet
communications and off-the-shelf hardware without requiring any modification or
specialized full-duplex capabilities.

Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication systems face increasing susceptibility
to advanced beam-stealing attacks, posing a significant physical layer security
threat. This paper introduces a novel framework employing an advanced Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent for proactive and adaptive defense against
these sophisticated attacks. A key innovation is leveraging Integrated Sensing
and Communications (ISAC) capabilities for active, intelligent threat
assessment. The DRL agent, built on a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
algorithm, dynamically controls ISAC probing actions to investigate suspicious
activities. We introduce an intensive curriculum learning strategy that
guarantees the agent experiences successful detection during training to
overcome the complex exploration challenges inherent to such a
security-critical task. Consequently, the agent learns a robust and adaptive
policy that intelligently balances security and communication performance.
Numerical results demonstrate that our framework achieves a mean attacker
detection rate of 92.8% while maintaining an average user SINR of over 13 dB.

Result: 在MESA数据集上的实验表明，双流交叉注意力架构显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: 结合PPG及其辅助信息的双流架构是提升睡眠分期效果的有效方法。

Abstract: Sleep monitoring through accessible wearable technology is crucial to
improving well-being in ubiquitous computing. Although
photoplethysmography(PPG) sensors are widely adopted in consumer devices,
achieving consistently reliable sleep staging using PPG alone remains a
non-trivial challenge. In this work, we explore multiple strategies to enhance
the performance of PPG-based sleep staging. Specifically, we compare
conventional single-stream model with dual-stream cross-attention strategies,
based on which complementary information can be learned via PPG and PPG-derived
modalities such as augmented PPG or synthetic ECG. To study the effectiveness
of the aforementioned approaches in four-stage sleep monitoring task, we
conducted experiments on the world's largest sleep staging dataset, i.e., the
Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis(MESA). We found that substantial
performance gain can be achieved by combining PPG and its auxiliary information
under the dual-stream cross-attention architecture. Source code of this project

Method: 基于信号时间对齐与错位的区分能力，设计自监督方法“concurrence”。

Result: 在fMRI、生理和行为信号中验证了方法的广泛适用性和科学相关性。

Conclusion: 该方法为跨领域科学发现提供了有力工具，但需注意外部因素导致的依赖关系。

Abstract: Measuring the statistical dependence between observed signals is a primary
tool for scientific discovery. However, biological systems often exhibit
complex non-linear interactions that currently cannot be captured without a
priori knowledge regarding the nature of dependence. We introduce a
self-supervised approach, concurrence, which is inspired by the observation
that if two signals are dependent, then one should be able to distinguish
between temporally aligned vs. misaligned segments extracted from them.
Experiments with fMRI, physiological and behavioral signals show that, to our
knowledge, concurrence is the first approach that can expose relationships
across such a wide spectrum of signals and extract scientifically relevant
differences without ad-hoc parameter tuning or reliance on a priori
information, providing a potent tool for scientific discoveries across fields.
However, depencencies caused by extraneous factors remain an open problem, thus
researchers should validate that exposed relationships truely pertain to the
question(s) of interest.

Conclusion: 物理引导的去噪策略能够实时解释低成本传感器数据，提升增材制造中的预测控制和缺陷缓解。

Abstract: Modern engineering systems are increasingly equipped with sensors for
real-time monitoring and decision-making. However, the data collected by these
sensors is often noisy and difficult to interpret, limiting its utility for
control and diagnostics. In this work, we propose a physics-informed denoising
framework that integrates energy-based model and Fisher score regularization to
jointly reduce data noise and enforce physical consistency with a physics-based
model. The approach is first validated on benchmark problems, including the
simple harmonic oscillator, Burgers' equation, and Laplace's equation, across
varying noise levels. We then apply the denoising framework to real thermal
emission data from laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) additive manufacturing
experiments, using a trained Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) surrogate
model of the LPBF process to guide denoising. Results show that the proposed
method outperforms baseline neural network denoisers, effectively reducing
noise under a range of LPBF processing conditions. This physics-guided
denoising strategy enables robust, real-time interpretation of low-cost sensor
data, facilitating predictive control and improved defect mitigation in
additive manufacturing.

Abstract: Smart agriculture applications, integrating technologies like the Internet of

hold promise to address modern challenges of rising food demand, environmental
pollution, and water scarcity. Alongside the concept of the phytobiome, which
defines the area including the plant, its environment, and associated
organisms, and the recent emergence of molecular communication (MC), there
exists an important opportunity to advance agricultural science and practice
using communication theory. In this article, we motivate to use the
communication engineering perspective for developing a holistic understanding
of the phytobiome communication and bridge the gap between the phytobiome
communication and smart agriculture. Firstly, an overview of phytobiome
communication via molecular and electrophysiological signals is presented and a
multi-scale framework modeling the phytobiome as a communication network is
conceptualized. Then, how this framework is used to model electrophysiological
signals is demonstrated with plant experiments. Furthermore, possible smart
agriculture applications, such as smart irrigation and targeted delivery of
agrochemicals, through engineering the phytobiome communication are proposed.
These applications merge ML/AI methods with the Internet of Bio-Nano-Things
enabled by MC and pave the way towards more efficient, sustainable, and
eco-friendly agricultural production. Finally, the implementation challenges,
open research issues, and industrial outlook for these applications are
discussed.

Conclusion: UNO-CG展示了混合方法的潜力，兼具数据驱动的高效性和经典求解器的可靠性，适用于广泛的工程和科学问题。

Abstract: Rapid and reliable solvers for parametric partial differential equations
(PDEs) are needed in many scientific and engineering disciplines. For example,
there is a growing demand for composites and architected materials with
heterogeneous microstructures. Designing such materials and predicting their
behavior in practical applications requires solving homogenization problems for
a wide range of material parameters and microstructures. While classical
numerical solvers offer reliable and accurate solutions supported by a solid
theoretical foundation, their high computational costs and slow convergence
remain limiting factors. As a result, scientific machine learning is emerging
as a promising alternative. However, such approaches often lack guaranteed
accuracy and physical consistency. This raises the question of whether it is
possible to develop hybrid approaches that combine the advantages of both
data-driven methods and classical solvers. To address this, we introduce
UNO-CG, a hybrid solver that accelerates conjugate gradient (CG) solvers using
specially designed machine-learned preconditioners, while ensuring convergence
by construction. As a preconditioner, we propose Unitary Neural Operators as a
modification of Fourier Neural Operators. Our method can be interpreted as a
data-driven discovery of Green's functions, which are then used to accelerate
iterative solvers. We evaluate UNO-CG on various homogenization problems
involving heterogeneous microstructures and millions of degrees of freedom. Our
results demonstrate that UNO-CG enables a substantial reduction in the number
of iterations and is competitive with handcrafted preconditioners for
homogenization problems that involve expert knowledge. Moreover, UNO-CG
maintains strong performance across a variety of boundary conditions, where
many specialized solvers are not applicable, highlighting its versatility and
robustness.

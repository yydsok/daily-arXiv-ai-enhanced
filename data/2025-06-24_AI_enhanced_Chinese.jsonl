This paper introduces DiLQR, a framework that\nfacilitates differentiation through iLQR, allowing it to serve as a trainable\nand differentiable module, either as or within a neural network. A novel aspect\nof this framework is the analytical solution that it provides for the gradient\nof an iLQR controller through implicit differentiation, which ensures a\nconstant backward cost regardless of iteration, while producing an accurate\ngradient. We evaluate our framework on imitation tasks on famous control\nbenchmarks. Our analytical method demonstrates superior computational\nperformance, achieving up to 128x speedup and a minimum of 21x speedup compared\nto automatic differentiation. Our method also demonstrates superior learning\nperformance ($10^6$x) compared to traditional neural network policies and\nbetter model loss with differentiable controllers that lack exact analytical\ngradients. Furthermore, we integrate our module into a larger network with\nvisual inputs to demonstrate the capacity of our method for high-dimensional,\nfully end-to-end tasks.

As aging is closely associated with increased fall risk,\nparticularly in wet and confined environments such as bathrooms where over 80\npercent of falls occur. Although recent research has increasingly focused on\nnon-intrusive, privacy-preserving approaches that do not rely on wearable\ndevices or video-based monitoring, these efforts have not fully overcome the\nlimitations of existing unimodal systems (e.g., WiFi-, infrared-, or\nmmWave-based), which are prone to reduced accuracy in complex environments.\nThese limitations stem from fundamental constraints in unimodal sensing,\nincluding system bias and environmental interference, such as multipath fading\nin WiFi-based systems and drastic temperature changes in infrared-based\nmethods. To address these challenges, we propose a Privacy-Preserving\nMultimodal Fall Detection System for Elderly People in Bathroom Environments.\nFirst, we develop a sensor evaluation framework to select and fuse\nmillimeter-wave radar with 3D vibration sensing, and use it to construct and\npreprocess a large-scale, privacy-preserving multimodal dataset in real\nbathroom settings, which will be released upon publication.

While RAG systems\naim to leverage such communications as a knowledge base, their effectiveness is\nlimited by raw data challenges: support tickets are typically noisy,\ninconsistent, and incomplete, making direct retrieval suboptimal. Unlike\nexisting RAG approaches that focus on runtime optimization, we introduce a\nnovel offline-first methodology that transforms these communications into a\nstructured knowledge base. Our key innovation is a LLMs-based multi-agent\nsystem orchestrating three specialized agents: Category Discovery for taxonomy\ncreation, Categorization for ticket grouping, and Knowledge Synthesis for\narticle generation. Applying our methodology to real-world support tickets with\nresolution notes and comments, our system creates a compact knowledge base -\nreducing total volume to just 3.4% of original ticket data while improving\nquality. Experiments demonstrate that our prebuilt knowledge base in RAG\nsystems significantly outperforms traditional RAG implementations (48.74% vs.\n38.60% helpful answers) and achieves a 77.4% reduction in unhelpful responses.\nBy automating institutional knowledge capture that typically remains siloed in\nexperts' heads, our solution translates to substantial operational efficiency:\nreducing support workload, accelerating resolution times, and creating\nself-improving systems that automatically resolve approximately 50% of future\nsupply chain tickets.

In real-world settings, the data quality (DQ) of different\nsources and modalities usually varies due to unexpected environmental factors\nor sensor issues. However, both researchers and practitioners in the AV field\noverwhelmingly concentrate on models/algorithms while undervaluing the DQ. To\nfulfill the needs of the next-generation AVs with guarantees of functionality,\nefficiency, and trustworthiness, this paper proposes a novel task-centric and\ndata quality vase framework which consists of five layers: data layer, DQ\nlayer, task layer, application layer, and goal layer.

This autonomy poses novel challenges for the safety of such\nsystems, both in single- and multi-agent scenarios. We argue that existing red\nteaming or safety evaluation frameworks fall short in evaluating safety risks\nin complex behaviors, thought processes and actions taken by agents. Moreover,\nthey fail to consider risks in multi-agent setups where various vulnerabilities\ncan be exposed when agents engage in complex behaviors and interactions with\neach other. To address this shortcoming, we introduce the term kaleidoscopic\nteaming which seeks to capture complex and wide range of vulnerabilities that\ncan happen in agents both in single-agent and multi-agent scenarios. We also\npresent a new kaleidoscopic teaming framework that generates a diverse array of\nscenarios modeling real-world human societies. Our framework evaluates safety\nof agents in both single-agent and multi-agent setups. In single-agent setup,\nan agent is given a scenario that it needs to complete using the tools it has\naccess to. In multi-agent setup, multiple agents either compete against or\ncooperate together to complete a task in the scenario through which we capture\nexisting safety vulnerabilities in agents.

A well-known example\nillustrating this concept is the competition at a country fair described by\nGalton, where the median value of the individual guesses about the weight of an\nox resulted in an astonishingly accurate estimate of the actual weight. This\nphenomenon resembles classical results in probability theory and relies on\nindependent decision-making. The accuracy of the group's final decision can be\nsignificantly reduced if the final agents' opinions are driven by a few\ninfluential agents.\n  In this paper, we consider a group of agents who initially possess\nuncorrelated and unbiased noisy measurements of a common state of the world.\nAssume these agents iteratively update their estimates according to a simple\nnon-Bayesian learning rule, commonly known in mathematical sociology as the\nFrench-DeGroot dynamics or iterative opinion pooling. As a result of this\niterative distributed averaging process, each agent arrives at an asymptotic\nestimate of the state of the world, with the variance of this estimate\ndetermined by the matrix of weights the agents assign to each other. Every\nagent aims at minimizing the variance of her asymptotic estimate of the state\nof the world; however, such variance is also influenced by the weights\nallocated by other agents.

Given that theory of mind has been\npredominantly studied within the context of developmental psychology, we\nanalyze developmental trends across a series of open-weight LLMs. Our results\nindicate that while LLMs have improved in reading comprehension, their theory\nof mind capabilities have not shown comparable development.

However, existing SSL methods for videos are not directly\napplicable to embryo development videos due to two challenges: (1) embryo\ntime-lapse videos contain hundreds of frames, requiring significant GPU memory\nfor conventional SSL; (2) the dataset contains videos with varying lengths and\nmany outlier frames, causing traditional video alignment methods to struggle\nwith semantic misalignment. We propose Spatial-Temporal Pre-Training (STPT) to\naddress these challenges. STPT includes two stages: spatial and temporal. In\neach stage, only one encoder is trained while the other is frozen, reducing\nmemory demands. To handle temporal misalignment, STPT avoids frame-by-frame\nalignment across videos.

As large language models (LLMs) evolve, there is increasing\ninterest in their ability to automate CTF challenge solving. For example, DARPA\nhas organized the AIxCC competition since 2023 to advance AI-powered automated\noffense and defense. However, this demands a combination of multiple abilities,\nfrom knowledge to reasoning and further to actions. In this paper, we highlight\nthe importance of technical knowledge in solving CTF problems and deliberately\nconstruct a focused benchmark, CTFKnow, with 3,992 questions to measure LLMs'\nperformance in this core aspect. Our study offers a focused and innovative\nmeasurement of LLMs' capability in understanding CTF knowledge and applying it\nto solve CTF challenges. Our key findings reveal that while LLMs possess\nsubstantial technical knowledge, they falter in accurately applying this\nknowledge to specific scenarios and adapting their strategies based on feedback\nfrom the CTF environment.\n  Based on insights derived from this measurement study, we propose CTFAgent, a\nnovel LLM-driven framework for advancing CTF problem-solving. CTFAgent\nintroduces two new modules: two-stage Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and\ninteractive Environmental Augmentation, which enhance LLMs' technical knowledge\nand vulnerability exploitation on CTF, respectively.

Effective alignment between motion and musical beats\nenhances viewer engagement and visual appeal, particularly in music videos,\npromotional content, and cinematic editing. Existing methods typically depend\non labor-intensive manual cutting, speed adjustments, or heuristic-based\nediting techniques to achieve synchronization. While some generative models\nhandle joint video and music generation, they often entangle the two\nmodalities, limiting flexibility in aligning video to music beats while\npreserving the full visual content. In this paper, we propose a novel and\nefficient framework, termed MVAA (Music-Video Auto-Alignment), that\nautomatically edits video to align with the rhythm of a given music track while\npreserving the original visual content. To enhance flexibility, we modularize\nthe task into a two-step process in our MVAA: aligning motion keyframes with\naudio beats, followed by rhythm-aware video inpainting. Specifically, we first\ninsert keyframes at timestamps aligned with musical beats, then use a\nframe-conditioned diffusion model to generate coherent intermediate frames,\npreserving the original video's semantic content. Since comprehensive test-time\ntraining can be time-consuming, we adopt a two-stage strategy: pretraining the\ninpainting module on a small video set to learn general motion priors, followed\nby rapid inference-time fine-tuning for video-specific adaptation. This hybrid\napproach enables adaptation within 10 minutes with one epoch on a single NVIDIA\n4090 GPU using CogVideoX-5b-I2V as the backbone.

Existing LLM Uncertainty\nQuantification (UQ) methods are primarily designed for single-turn\nquestion-answering formats, resulting in multi-step decision-making scenarios,\ne.g., LLM agentic system, being underexplored. In this paper, we introduce a\nprincipled, information-theoretic framework that decomposes LLM sequential\ndecision uncertainty into two parts: (i) internal uncertainty intrinsic to the\ncurrent decision, which is focused on existing UQ methods, and (ii) extrinsic\nuncertainty, a Mutual-Information (MI) quantity describing how much uncertainty\nshould be inherited from preceding decisions. We then propose UProp, an\nefficient and effective extrinsic uncertainty estimator that converts the\ndirect estimation of MI to the estimation of Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI)\nover multiple Trajectory-Dependent Decision Processes (TDPs). UProp is\nevaluated over extensive multi-step decision-making benchmarks, e.g.,\nAgentBench and HotpotQA, with state-of-the-art LLMs, e.g., GPT-4.1 and\nDeepSeek-V3. Experimental results demonstrate that UProp significantly\noutperforms existing single-turn UQ baselines equipped with thoughtful\naggregation strategies.

However, current\nfine-tuning methods use a syntax learning paradigm that forces agents to\nreproduce exactly the ground truth action strings, leading to\nout-of-distribution (OOD) vulnerability. To fill this gap, we propose Action\nSemantics Learning (ASL), a novel learning framework, where the learning\nobjective is capturing the semantics of the ground truth actions.

To\nsupport the effectiveness of ASL, we theoretically demonstrate the superior\nrobustness of ASL for the OOD problem compared with the existing syntax\nlearning paradigm.

The ONH of one eye was imaged\nunder two conditions: (1) primary gaze and (2) primary gaze with IOP elevated\nto ~35 mmHg via ophthalmo-dynamometry. Glaucoma experts classified the subjects\ninto four categories based on the presence of specific visual field defects:\n(1) superior nasal step (N=26), (2) superior partial arcuate (N=62), (3) full\nsuperior hemifield defect (N=25), and (4) other/non-specific defects (N=124).\nAutomatic ONH tissue segmentation and digital volume correlation were used to\ncompute IOP-induced neural tissue and lamina cribrosa (LC) strains.\nBiomechanical and structural features were input to a Geometric Deep Learning\nmodel.

During the group dance generation process, however, most existing\nmethods still face three primary issues: multi-dancer collisions, single-dancer\nfoot sliding and abrupt swapping in the generation of long group dance. In this\npaper, we propose TCDiff++, a music-driven end-to-end framework designed to\ngenerate harmonious group dance. Specifically, to mitigate multi-dancer\ncollisions, we utilize a dancer positioning embedding to better maintain the\nrelative positioning among dancers. Additionally, we incorporate a\ndistance-consistency loss to ensure that inter-dancer distances remain within\nplausible ranges. To address the issue of single-dancer foot sliding, we\nintroduce a swap mode embedding to indicate dancer swapping patterns and design\na Footwork Adaptor to refine raw motion, thereby minimizing foot sliding. For\nlong group dance generation, we present a long group diffusion sampling\nstrategy that reduces abrupt position shifts by injecting positional\ninformation into the noisy input.

Case study shows that VeriLocc discovers more\nperformant assignments than expert-tuned libraries, outperforming rocBLAS by\nover 10% in runtime.", "AI": {"tldr": "VeriLocc\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u4e0e\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8GPU\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u5bc4\u5b58\u5668\u5206\u914d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3GPU\u53d1\u5c55\u8fc5\u901f\uff0c\u4f46\u751f\u4ea7\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u4ecd\u4f9d\u8d56\u624b\u5de5\u8c03\u6574\u7684\u5bc4\u5b58\u5668\u5206\u914d\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9700\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4ee3\u786c\u4ef6\u91cd\u65b0\u8c03\u6574\u3002", "method": "VeriLocc\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03LLM\u5c06\u4e2d\u95f4\u8868\u793a\uff08MIRs\uff09\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u76ee\u6807\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u5bc4\u5b58\u5668\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u518d\u751f\u5faa\u73af\u786e\u4fdd\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u6cd5\uff08GEMM\uff09\u548c\u591a\u5934\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff08MHA\uff09\u4e0a\uff0cVeriLocc\u5355\u6b21\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe85-99%\uff0cpass@100\u63a5\u8fd1100%\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e13\u5bb6\u8c03\u4f18\u5e93\u3002", "conclusion": "VeriLocc\u5c55\u793a\u4e86LLM\u5728\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u52a8\u53d1\u73b0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u5bc4\u5b58\u5668\u5206\u914d\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Project\n  website: https://pratikkunapuli.github.io/rl-vs-gc/", "summary": "Learning-based control approaches like reinforcement learning (RL) have\nrecently produced a slew of impressive results for tasks like quadrotor\ntrajectory tracking and drone racing. Naturally, it is common to demonstrate\nthe advantages of these new controllers against established methods like\nanalytical controllers. We observe, however, that reliably comparing the\nperformance of such very different classes of controllers is more complicated\nthan might appear at first sight. As a case study, we take up the problem of\nagile tracking of an end-effector for a quadrotor with a fixed arm. We develop\na set of best practices for synthesizing the best-in-class RL and geometric\ncontrollers (GC) for benchmarking. In the process, we resolve widespread\nRL-favoring biases in prior studies that provide asymmetric access to: (1) the\ntask definition, in the form of an objective function, (2) representative\ndatasets, for parameter optimization, and (3) feedforward information,\ndescribing the desired future trajectory. The resulting findings are the\nfollowing: our improvements to the experimental protocol for comparing learned\nand classical controllers are critical, and each of the above asymmetries can\nyield misleading conclusions. Prior works have claimed that RL outperforms GC,\nbut we find the gaps between the two controller classes are much smaller than\npreviously published when accounting for symmetric comparisons. Geometric\ncontrol achieves lower steady-state error than RL, while RL has better\ntransient performance, resulting in GC performing better in relatively slow or\nless agile tasks, but RL performing better when greater agility is required.\nFinally, we open-source implementations of geometric and RL controllers for\nthese aerial vehicles, implementing best practices for future development.\nWebsite and code is available at https://pratikkunapuli.github.io/rl-vs-gc/", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u516c\u5e73\u6bd4\u8f83\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff08\u5982RL\uff09\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u51e0\u4f55\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff08GC\uff09\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u6bd4\u8f83RL\u548cGC\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u7684\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ed3\u679c\u53ef\u80fd\u8bef\u5bfc\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff08\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u98de\u884c\u5668\u7684\u654f\u6377\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u5957\u6700\u4f73\u5b9e\u8df5\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5bf9\u79f0\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u6539\u8fdb\u540e\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u663e\u793aRL\u548cGC\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524d\u62a5\u9053\u7684\u5c0f\uff0cGC\u5728\u7a33\u6001\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0cRL\u5728\u77ac\u6001\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u79f0\u6bd4\u8f83\u5bf9\u516c\u5e73\u8bc4\u4f30\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u5f00\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u548c\u6700\u4f73\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

Traditional human-led fact-checking methods, while credible,\nstruggle with the volume and velocity of online content, prompting the\nintegration of automated systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs).\nHowever, existing automated approaches often face limitations, such as handling\ncomplex claims, ensuring source credibility, and maintaining transparency. This\npaper proposes a novel multi-agent system for automated fact-checking that\nenhances accuracy, efficiency, and explainability. The system comprises four\nspecialized agents: an Input Ingestion Agent for claim decomposition, a Query\nGeneration Agent for formulating targeted subqueries, an Evidence Retrieval\nAgent for sourcing credible evidence, and a Verdict Prediction Agent for\nsynthesizing veracity judgments with human-interpretable explanations.\nEvaluated on benchmark datasets (FEVEROUS, HOVER, SciFact), the proposed system\nachieves a 12.3% improvement in Macro F1-score over baseline methods. The\nsystem effectively decomposes complex claims, retrieves reliable evidence from\ntrusted sources, and generates transparent explanations for verification\ndecisions. Our approach contributes to the growing field of automated\nfact-checking by providing a more accurate, efficient, and transparent\nverification methodology that aligns with human fact-checking practices while\nmaintaining scalability for real-world applications.

We build a large dataset of\nprofessional swings from publicly available videos, reconstruct full-body 3D\nkinematics using biologically accurate human mesh recovery, and generate\nsynthetic inertial data to train neural networks that infer motion and segment\nswing phases from wrist-based input. We learn a compositional, discrete\nvocabulary of motion primitives that facilitates the detection and\nvisualization of technical flaws, and is expressive enough to predict player\nidentity, club type, sex, and age.

Prior methods leverage CLIP's strong out-of-distribution (OOD) abilities\nby generating domain-specific prompts to guide its generalized, frozen\nfeatures. However, since downstream datasets are not explicitly seen by CLIP,\nsolely depending on the feature space knowledge is constrained by CLIP's prior\nknowledge. Notably, when using a less robust backbone like ViT-B/16,\nperformance significantly drops on challenging real-world benchmarks. Departing\nfrom the state-of-the-art of inheriting the intrinsic OOD capability of CLIP,\nthis work introduces learning directly on the input space to complement the\ndataset-specific knowledge for frozen CLIP. Specifically, an independent side\nbranch is attached in parallel with CLIP and enforced to learn exclusive\nknowledge via revert attention.

To address\nthis challenge, we present FedMRG, the first framework that leverages Federated\nLearning (FL) to enable privacy-preserving, multi-center development of\nLLM-driven MRG models, specifically designed to overcome the critical challenge\nof communication-efficient LLM training under multi-modal data heterogeneity.\nTo start with, our framework tackles the fundamental challenge of communication\noverhead in FL-LLM tuning by employing low-rank factorization to efficiently\ndecompose parameter updates, significantly reducing gradient transmission costs\nand making LLM-driven MRG feasible in bandwidth-constrained FL settings.\nFurthermore, we observed the dual heterogeneity in MRG under the FL scenario:\nvarying image characteristics across medical centers, as well as diverse\nreporting styles and terminology preferences. To address this, we further\nenhance FedMRG with (1) client-aware contrastive learning in the MRG encoder,\ncoupled with diagnosis-driven prompts, which capture both globally\ngeneralizable and locally distinctive features while maintaining diagnostic\naccuracy; and (2) a dual-adapter mutual boosting mechanism in the MRG decoder\nthat harmonizes generic and specialized adapters to address variations in\nreporting styles and terminology.

Notably, however, this theory does not extend to describe the role\nof self-attention in this process. In this work, we take a preliminary step in\nthis direction to extend this theory to the case of diffusion models whose\nscore is parametrized by a CNN with a final self-attention layer.

These annotations enable a structured evaluation of four\ninterrelated tasks central to autonomous decision-making: object detection,\nintent prediction, risk assessment, and action suggestion. As a reference\nbaseline, we propose SGG-Intent, a lightweight, training-free framework that\nmirrors the ego vehicle's reasoning pipeline.

In this work, we propose RoboArena, a new approach for\nscalable evaluation of generalist robot policies in the real world. Instead of\nstandardizing evaluations around fixed tasks, environments, or locations, we\npropose to crowd-source evaluations across a distributed network of evaluators.\nImportantly, evaluators can freely choose the tasks and environments they\nevaluate on, enabling easy scaling of diversity, but they are required to\nperform double-blind evaluations over pairs of policies. Then, by aggregating\npreference feedback from pairwise comparisons across diverse tasks and\nenvironments, we can derive a ranking of policies.

The key challenge of this task lies in the inherent\ncomplexities of two-person dance interactions, where the partners need to\nsynchronize both with each other and with the music. Inspired by the recent\nadvances in motion synthesis, we propose a two-stage solution: encoding\ntwo-person motions into discrete tokens and then generating these tokens from\nmusic. To effectively capture intricate interactions, we represent both\ndancers' motions as a unified whole to learn the necessary motion tokens, and\nadopt a coarse-to-fine learning strategy in both the stages. Our first stage\nutilizes a VQ-VAE that hierarchically separates high-level semantic features at\na coarse temporal resolution from low-level details at a finer resolution,\nproducing two discrete token sequences at different abstraction levels.\nSubsequently, in the second stage, two generative masked transformers learn to\nmap music signals to these dance tokens: the first producing high-level\nsemantic tokens, and the second, conditioned on music and these semantic\ntokens, producing the low-level tokens.

Ground based tracking requires setting up\ninfrastructure, could be range limited, and may not be feasible in remote\nareas, crowded cities or in dense vegetation areas. Vision based active\ntracking of aerial objects from another airborne vehicle, e.g., a chaser\nunmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), promises to fill this important gap, along with\nserving aerial coordination use cases. Vision-based active tracking by a UAV\nentails solving two coupled problems: 1) compute-efficient and accurate\n(target) object detection and target state estimation; and 2) maneuver\ndecisions to ensure that the target remains in the field of view in the future\ntime-steps and favorably positioned for continued detection.

However, recent studies show that\nSDE models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which are often limited to\nunrealistic settings, e.g., digital perturbations on separate stereo views in\nstatic scenes, restricting their real-world applicability. This raises a\ncritical question: how can we design physically realizable, scene-adaptive, and\ntransferable attacks against SDE under realistic constraints?\n  To answer this, we make two key contributions. First, we propose a unified\nattack framework that extends optimization-based techniques to four core stages\nof stereo matching: feature extraction, cost-volume construction, cost\naggregation, and disparity regression. A comprehensive stage-wise evaluation\nacross 9 mainstream SDE models, under constraints like photometric consistency,\nreveals that optimization-based patches suffer from poor transferability.\nInterestingly, partially transferable patches suggest that patterns, rather\nthan pixel-level perturbations, may be key to generalizable attacks. Motivated\nby this, we present PatchHunter, the first optimization-free adversarial patch\nattack against SDE.

This tendency of LMs to\ngenerate hallucinated content undermines their reliability, especially because\nthese fabrications are often highly convincing and therefore difficult to\ndetect. While several existing methods attempt to detect hallucinations, most\nrely on analyzing multiple generations per input, leading to increased\ncomputational cost and latency. To address this, we propose a single-pass,\ntraining-free approach for effective Hallucination detectIon via Decoupled\nrEpresentations (HIDE). Our approach leverages the hypothesis that\nhallucinations result from a statistical decoupling between an LM's internal\nrepresentations of input context and its generated output. We quantify this\ndecoupling using the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) applied to\nhidden-state representations extracted while generating the output sequence. We\nconduct extensive experiments on four diverse question answering datasets,\nevaluating both faithfulness and factuality hallucinations across six\nopen-source LMs of varying scales and properties.

Our study provides practical\ninsights for building more fair, efficient, and linguistically informed\ntokenizers for multilingual NLP.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e8617\u79cd\u5370\u5ea6\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86BPE\u548cUnigram LM\u7b97\u6cd5\u3001\u8bcd\u6c47\u91cf\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8bcd\u6c47\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u53ef\u4ece\u9ad8\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u53d7\u76ca\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6807\u8bb0\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u9ad8\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u6709\u504f\uff0c\u5bf9\u5370\u5ea6\u6b21\u5927\u9646\u7b49\u8bed\u8a00\u591a\u6837\u6027\u9ad8\u3001\u5f62\u6001\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u5bf917\u79cd\u5370\u5ea6\u8bed\u8a00\u8fdb\u884c\u5185\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83BPE\u548cUnigram LM\u7b97\u6cd5\u3001\u8bcd\u6c47\u91cf\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8bcd\u6c47\u6784\u5efa\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u8054\u5408\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\u5316\u5668\u53d7\u76ca\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u516c\u5e73\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\u5316\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u591a\u8bed\u8a00NLP\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u516c\u5e73\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u8bed\u8a00\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

This study\naddresses this gap by introducing Interactive Reinforcement Learning (RL) as a\ncognitive model for teachable social robots. We conducted two between-subject\nexperiments with 58 primary school children, who either taught a robot or\npracticed independently on a tablet while learning French vocabulary\n(memorization) and grammatical rules (inference). The robot, powered by\nInteractive RL, learned from the child's evaluative feedback. Children in the\nLbT condition achieved significantly higher retention gains compared to those\nin the self-practice condition, especially on the grammar task. Learners with\nlower prior knowledge benefited most from teaching the robot. Behavioural\nmetrics revealed that children adapted their teaching strategies over time and\nengaged more deeply during inference tasks. This work makes two contributions:\n(1) it introduces Interactive RL as a pedagogically effective and scalable\nmodel for peer-robot learning, and (2) it demonstrates, for the first time, the\nfeasibility of deploying multiple autonomous robots simultaneously in real\nclassrooms.

During SME, the general capabilities of LLMs can be\nnegatively affected due to the introduction of new parameters. In this paper,\nwe propose a queue-based self-correction framework (QueueEDIT) that not only\nenhances SME performance by addressing long-sequence dependency but also\nmitigates the impact of parameter bias on the general capabilities of LLMs.\nSpecifically, we first introduce a structural mapping editing loss to map the\ntriplets to the knowledge-sensitive neurons within the Transformer layers of\nLLMs. We then store the located parameters for each piece of edited knowledge\nin a queue and dynamically align previously edited parameters. In each edit, we\nselect queue parameters most relevant to the currently located parameters to\ndetermine whether previous knowledge needs realignment. Irrelevant parameters\nin the queue are frozen, and we update the parameters at the queue head to the\nLLM to ensure they do not harm general abilities.

What drives this stability in the\ngeneration? We investigate this phenomenon through the lens of probability\nconcentration in the model's output distribution. To quantify this\nconcentration, we introduce the Branching Factor (BF) -- a token-invariant\nmeasure of the effective number of plausible next steps during generation. Our\nempirical analysis reveals two key findings: (1) BF often decreases as\ngeneration progresses, suggesting that LLMs become more predictable as they\ngenerate. (2) alignment tuning substantially sharpens the model's output\ndistribution from the outset, reducing BF by nearly an order of magnitude\n(e.g., from 12 to 1.2) relative to base models. This stark reduction helps\nexplain why aligned models often appear less sensitive to decoding strategies.\nBuilding on this insight, we find this stability has surprising implications\nfor complex reasoning. Aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT) models (e.g.,\nDeepSeek-distilled models), for instance, leverage this effect; by generating\nlonger reasoning chains, they push generation into later, more deterministic\n(lower BF) stages, resulting in more stable outputs. We hypothesize that\nalignment tuning does not fundamentally change a model's behavior, but instead\nsteers it toward stylistic tokens (e.g., \"Sure\") that unlock low-entropy\ntrajectories already present in the base model. This view is supported by\nnudging experiments, which show that prompting base models with such tokens can\nsimilarly reduce BF. Together, our findings establish BF as a powerful\ndiagnostic for understanding and controlling LLM outputs - clarifying how\nalignment reduces variability, how CoT promotes stable generations, and how\nbase models can be steered away from diversity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u751f\u6210\u8f93\u51fa\u7f3a\u4e4f\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5206\u652f\u56e0\u5b50\uff08BF\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5316\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5bf9\u9f50\u8c03\u4f18\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86BF\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5176\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u9f50LLM\u751f\u6210\u8f93\u51fa\u7f3a\u4e4f\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5176\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u96c6\u4e2d\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5206\u652f\u56e0\u5b50\uff08BF\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5316\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2dBF\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5bf9\u9f50\u8c03\u4f18\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9BF\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0BF\u968f\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u9012\u51cf\uff0c\u5bf9\u9f50\u8c03\u4f18\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4eBF\uff0c\u4e14\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u7c7b\u4f3c\u5730\u51cf\u5c11BF\u3002", "conclusion": "BF\u662f\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u63a7\u5236LLM\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5bf9\u9f50\u8c03\u4f18\u548cCoT\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u71b5\u8f68\u8ff9\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u751f\u6210\u3002"}}

While existing studies\nprimarily attribute the over-smoothing to repeated applications of graph\nLaplacian operators, our empirical analysis reveals a critical yet overlooked\nfactor: trainable linear transformations in GCNs significantly exacerbate\nfeature collapse, even at moderate depths (e.g., 8 layers). In contrast,\nSimplified Graph Convolution (SGC), which removes these transformations,\nmaintains stable feature diversity up to 32 layers, highlighting linear\ntransformations' dual role in facilitating expressive power and inducing\nover-smoothing.

Recent\nmethods commonly utilize a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model to\nsynthesize new content of previously unseen regions along camera movement.\nHowever, the underlying 2D diffusion model lacks 3D awareness and results in\ndistorted artifacts. Moreover, they are limited to generating views of static\n3D scenes, neglecting to capture object movements within the dynamic 4D world.\nTo alleviate these issues, we present DreamJourney, a two-stage framework that\nleverages the world simulation capacity of video diffusion models to trigger a\nnew perpetual scene view generation task with both camera movements and object\ndynamics. Specifically, in stage I, DreamJourney first lifts the input image to\n3D point cloud and renders a sequence of partial images from a specific camera\ntrajectory. A video diffusion model is then utilized as generative prior to\ncomplete the missing regions and enhance visual coherence across the sequence,\nproducing a cross-view consistent video adheres to the 3D scene and camera\ntrajectory. Meanwhile, we introduce two simple yet effective strategies (early\nstopping and view padding) to further stabilize the generation process and\nimprove visual quality. Next, in stage II, DreamJourney leverages a multimodal\nlarge language model to produce a text prompt describing object movements in\ncurrent view, and uses video diffusion model to animate current view with\nobject movements. Stage I and II are repeated recurrently, enabling perpetual\ndynamic scene view generation.

Despite this\ncommon practice, it remains unknown whether edits persist after fine-tuning or\nwhether they are inadvertently reversed. This question has fundamental\npractical implications. For example, if fine-tuning removes prior edits, it\ncould serve as a defence mechanism against hidden malicious edits. Vice versa,\nthe unintended removal of edits related to bias mitigation could pose serious\nsafety concerns. We systematically investigate the interaction between model\nediting and fine-tuning in the context of T2I diffusion models, which are known\nto exhibit biases and generate inappropriate content. Our study spans two T2I\nmodel families (Stable Diffusion and FLUX), two sota editing techniques, and\nthree fine-tuning methods (DreamBooth, LoRA, and DoRA). Through an extensive\nempirical analysis across diverse editing tasks and evaluation metrics, our\nfindings reveal a trend: edits generally fail to persist through fine-tuning,\neven when fine-tuning is tangential or unrelated to the edits. Notably, we\nobserve that DoRA exhibits the strongest edit reversal effect.

However, amongst other\nthings, the flexibility of the cables and the fact that they can only pull (and\nnot push) render the dynamics of CDPRs complex.

To address these challenges, we propose a novel Pattern\nDivide-and-Conquer Network (PDC-Net) for PRI segmentation. The core idea is to\nuse different network modules to \"divide\" various local and global patterns\nand, through flexible feature selection, to \"conquer\" the Regions of Interest\n(ROI) during the decoding phase.

While\nthere are established methods for point clouds of sufficient quality,\nstate-of-the-art still struggles when this quality drops. Thus, this paper\npresents a novel learning-based framework for predicting robust point\ncorrespondences between pairs of noisy, sparse and unstructured 3D point clouds\nfrom a light-weight, low-power, inexpensive, consumer-grade System-on-Chip\n(SoC) Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar sensor. Our network is\nbased on the transformer architecture which allows leveraging the attention\nmechanism to discover pairs of points in consecutive scans with the greatest\nmutual affinity. The proposed network is trained in a self-supervised way using\nset-based multi-label classification cross-entropy loss, where the ground-truth\nset of matches is found by solving the Linear Sum Assignment (LSA) optimization\nproblem, which avoids tedious hand annotation of the training data.\nAdditionally, posing the loss calculation as multi-label classification permits\nsupervising on point correspondences directly instead of on odometry error,\nwhich is not feasible for sparse and noisy data from the SoC radar we use. We\nevaluate our method with an open-source state-of-the-art Radar-Inertial\nOdometry (RIO) framework in real-world Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) flights\nand with the widely used public Coloradar dataset.

However, both the\nconvolutional architectures of YOLO11 and earlier versions and the area-based\nself-attention mechanism introduced in YOLOv12 are limited to local information\naggregation and pairwise correlation modeling, lacking the capability to\ncapture global multi-to-multi high-order correlations, which limits detection\nperformance in complex scenarios.

Machine\nlearning has been widely used to assess individual risk for chronic diseases.\nHowever, many models rely on medical test data (e.g. blood results, glucose\nlevels), which limits their utility for proactive self-assessment.\nAdditionally, to gain public trust, machine learning models should be\nexplainable and transparent.

To address these issues, we develop deep learning models that\npredict the risk of developing 13 chronic diseases using only personal and\nlifestyle factors, enabling accessible, self-directed preventive care.\nImportantly, we use SHAP-based explainability to identify the most influential\nmodel features and validate them against established medical literature.

These gaps impede research data standardization and hamper AI-driven\nprogress. In this study, we address these challenges by developing Airalogy\n(https://airalogy.com), the world's first AI- and community-driven platform\nthat balances universality and standardization for digitizing research data\nacross multiple disciplines. Airalogy represents entire research workflows\nusing customizable, standardized data records and offers an advanced AI\nresearch copilot for intelligent Q&A, automated data entry, analysis, and\nresearch automation.

Many existing methods rely on\nmotion capture systems, pre-mapped scenes, or feature-based localization to\nensure safety and control, limiting their deployment in real-world conditions.\nWe introduce NOVA, a fully onboard, object-centric framework that enables\nrobust target tracking and collision-aware navigation using only a stereo\ncamera and an IMU. Rather than constructing a global map or relying on absolute\nlocalization, NOVA formulates perception, estimation, and control entirely in\nthe target's reference frame. A tightly integrated stack combines a lightweight\nobject detector with stereo depth completion, followed by histogram-based\nfiltering to infer robust target distances under occlusion and noise. These\nmeasurements feed a visual-inertial state estimator that recovers the full\n6-DoF pose of the robot relative to the target. A nonlinear model predictive\ncontroller (NMPC) plans dynamically feasible trajectories in the target frame.\nTo ensure safety, high-order control barrier functions are constructed online\nfrom a compact set of high-risk collision points extracted from depth, enabling\nreal-time obstacle avoidance without maps or dense representations.

To explore this idea, we finetune LLMs on two sets of\nprograms representing simple maths problems and algorithms: one with source\ncode and I/O examples (w/ IO), the other with source code only (w/o IO). We\nfind evidence that LLMs have some ability to evaluate w/o IO programs for\ninputs in a range of experimental settings, and make several observations.\nFirstly, PBB works significantly better when programs are provided as code\nrather than semantically equivalent language descriptions. Secondly, LLMs can\nproduce outputs for w/o IO programs directly, by implicitly evaluating the\nprogram within the forward pass, and more reliably when stepping through the\nprogram in-context via chain-of-thought. We further show that PBB leads to more\nrobust evaluation of programs across inputs than training on I/O pairs drawn\nfrom a distribution that mirrors naturally occurring data. Our findings suggest\na mechanism for enhanced reasoning through code training: it allows LLMs to\ninternalise reusable algorithmic abstractions.

At the core of this\nimportant robotic field is shape servoing, a task focused on controlling\ndeformable objects into desired shapes. The shape servoing formulation requires\nthe specification of a goal shape. However, most prior works in shape servoing\nrely on impractical goal shape acquisition methods, such as laborious\ndomain-knowledge engineering or manual manipulation. DefGoalNet previously\nposed the current state-of-the-art solution to this problem, which learns\ndeformable object goal shapes directly from a small number of human\ndemonstrations.

This\nenables the generation of diverse goal shapes and avoids the averaging\nartifacts.

We assume that color features decoupled by\ndifferent images with the same color should be exactly the same. Under this\nassumption, we train a fixed color vector codebook to which the decoupled color\nfeatures will map.

As the target color\n(decoupled from a selected template image) will also affect the performance of\nstain normalization, we further design a template image selection algorithm to\nselect a template from a given dataset.

Currently, transformer-based methods are gaining increasing attention\ndue to their elegant pipelines and superior predictions. However, these methods\nprimarily focus on modeling the external relationships between scene features\nand query features through mask attention. They lack effective modeling of the\ninternal relationships among scene features as well as between query features.\nIn light of these disadvantages, we propose \\textbf{Relation3D: Enhancing\nRelation Modeling for Point Cloud Instance Segmentation}.

Despite growing recognition of bias in LLMs,\nprompt engineering strategies specifically addressing Arab and Muslim\nrepresentation remain understudied. This mixed-methods systematic review\nexamines such techniques, offering evidence-based guidance for researchers and\npractitioners. Following PRISMA guidelines and Kitchenham's systematic review\nmethodology, we analyzed 8 empirical studies published between 2021-2024\ninvestigating bias mitigation strategies. Our findings reveal five primary\nprompt engineering approaches: cultural prompting, affective priming,\nself-debiasing techniques, structured multi-step pipelines, and\nparameter-optimized continuous prompts. Although all approaches show potential\nfor reducing bias, effectiveness varied substantially across studies and bias\ntypes. Evidence suggests that certain bias types may be more resistant to\nprompt-based mitigation than others. Structured multi-step pipelines\ndemonstrated the highest overall effectiveness, achieving up to 87.7% reduction\nin bias, though they require greater technical expertise. Cultural prompting\noffers broader accessibility with substantial effectiveness.

However, we\nidentify two critical challenges in this direction: (1) VLMs tend to learn\nshortcuts by relying heavily on history input information, achieving seemingly\nstrong planning results without genuinely understanding the visual inputs; and\n(2) the chain-ofthought (COT) reasoning processes are always misaligned with\nthe motion planning outcomes, and how to effectively leverage the complex\nreasoning capability to enhance planning remains largely underexplored. In this\npaper, we start from a small-scale domain-specific VLM and propose Drive-R1\ndesigned to bridges the scenario reasoning and motion planning for AD.

Each\ngenerator is then tasked with producing synthetic datasets under two\nconditions: a 1:1 (1,000 rows) and a 1:10 (10,000 rows) input-output ratio.\nEvaluation is conducted using two criteria: statistical similarity, measured\nvia classical statistics and distributional metrics; and predictive utility,\nassessed using a \"Train on Synthetic, Test on Real\" approach with four\nregression models. While statistical similarity remained consistent across\nmodels in both scenarios, predictive utility declined notably in the 1:10 case.\nThe Bayesian Network from Synthicity achieved the highest fidelity in both\nscenarios, while TVAE from SDV performed best in predictive tasks under the\n1:10 setting. Although no significant performance gap was found between the two\nlibraries, SDV stands out for its superior documentation and ease of use,\nmaking it more accessible for practitioners.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u516d\u79cd\u8868\u683c\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u5668\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u7edf\u8ba1\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u800cTVAE\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u597d\u3002SDV\u56e0\u5176\u6587\u6863\u548c\u6613\u7528\u6027\u66f4\u53d7\u63a8\u8350\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u83b7\u53d6\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528UCI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u4e0b\u8bad\u7ec3\u516d\u79cd\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7edf\u8ba1\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u7edf\u8ba1\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0cTVAE\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u597d\u3002SDV\u56e0\u6587\u6863\u548c\u6613\u7528\u6027\u66f4\u53d7\u63a8\u8350\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u5668\u5728\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0cSDV\u56e0\u5176\u6613\u7528\u6027\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

However, existing dynamic/mixed precision\nquantization requires retraining or special hardware, whereas post-training\nquantization (PTQ) has two limitations for resource adaptation: (i) The\nstate-of-the-art PTQ methods only provide one fixed bitwidth model, which makes\nit challenging to adapt to the dynamic resources of IoT devices; (ii) Deploying\nmultiple PTQ models with diverse bitwidths consumes large storage resources and\nswitching overheads. To this end, this paper introduces a resource-friendly\npost-training integer-nesting quantization, i.e., NestQuant, for on-device\nquantized model switching on IoT devices. The proposed NestQuant incorporates\nthe integer weight decomposition, which bit-wise splits quantized weights into\nhigher-bit and lower-bit weights of integer data types. It also contains a\ndecomposed weights nesting mechanism to optimize the higher-bit weights by\nadaptive rounding and nest them into the original quantized weights. In\ndeployment, we can send and store only one NestQuant model and switch between\nthe full-bit/part-bit model by paging in/out lower-bit weights to adapt to\nresource changes and reduce consumption. Experimental results on the\nImageNet-1K pretrained DNNs demonstrated that the NestQuant model can achieve\nhigh performance in top-1 accuracy, and reduce in terms of data transmission,\nstorage consumption, and switching overheads. In particular, the ResNet-101\nwith INT8 nesting INT6 can achieve 78.1% and 77.9% accuracy for full-bit and\npart-bit models, respectively, and reduce switching overheads by approximately\n78.1% compared with diverse bitwidths PTQ models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aNestQuant\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u53cb\u597d\u578b\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6574\u6570\u5d4c\u5957\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u5207\u6362\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8d44\u6e90\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u5b58\u50a8\u6d88\u8017\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u52a8\u6001/\u6df7\u5408\u7cbe\u5ea6\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u7279\u6b8a\u786c\u4ef6\uff0c\u800c\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u91cf\u5316\uff08PTQ\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u52a8\u6001\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\u4e14\u5b58\u50a8\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u6570\u6743\u91cd\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u5d4c\u5957\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5c06\u91cf\u5316\u6743\u91cd\u6309\u4f4d\u62c6\u5206\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6bd4\u7279\u548c\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u9ad8\u6bd4\u7279\u6743\u91cd\u5e76\u5d4c\u5957\u5230\u539f\u59cb\u91cf\u5316\u6743\u91cd\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5728ImageNet-1K\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3DNN\u4e0a\uff0cNestQuant\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982ResNet-101 INT8\u5d4c\u5957INT6\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5206\u522b\u4e3a78.1%\u548c77.9%\uff0c\u5207\u6362\u5f00\u9500\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea678.1%\u3002", "conclusion": "NestQuant\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u8bbe\u5907\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u8d44\u6e90\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u4f4e\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5207\u6362\u3002"}}

Proper scoring rules assess the quality\nof predictions and require that the expected score gets uniquely maximized at\nthe precise prediction, in which case we call the score directly elicits the\nproperty. Previous research work has widely studied the existence and the\ncharacterization of proper scoring rules for different properties, but little\nliterature discusses the choice of proper scoring rules for applications at\nhand. In this paper, we explore a novel task, the indirect elicitation of\nproperties with parametric assumptions, where the target property is a function\nof several directly-elicitable sub-properties and the total score is a weighted\nsum of proper scoring rules for each sub-property. Because of the restriction\nto a parametric model class, different settings for the weights lead to\ndifferent constrained optimal solutions. Our goal is to figure out how the\nchoice of weights affects the estimation of the target property and which\nchoice is the best. We start it with simulation studies and observe an\ninteresting pattern: in most cases, the optimal estimation of the target\nproperty changes monotonically with the increase of each weight, and the best\nconfiguration of weights is often to set some weights as zero. To understand\nhow it happens, we first establish the elementary theoretical framework and\nthen provide deeper sufficient conditions for the case of two sub-properties\nand of more sub-properties respectively.

We propose a shield\nconstruction that provides run-time safety guarantees under perception errors\nby restricting the actions available to an agent, modeled as a Markov decision\nprocess, as a function of the state estimates. Our construction uses conformal\nprediction for the perception component, which guarantees that for each\nobservation, the predicted set of estimates includes the actual state with a\nuser-specified probability.

Conventional MIL methods struggle\nto model these scattered tissue distributions and capture cross-regional\nspatial interactions effectively. To address these limitations, we propose a\nnovel Multiple instance learning framework with Context-Aware Clustering\n(MiCo), designed to enhance cross-regional intra-tissue correlations and\nstrengthen inter-tissue semantic associations in WSIs. MiCo begins by\nclustering instances to distill discriminative morphological patterns, with\ncluster centroids serving as semantic anchors. To enhance cross-regional\nintra-tissue correlations, MiCo employs a Cluster Route module, which\ndynamically links instances of the same tissue type across distant regions via\nfeature similarity. These semantic anchors act as contextual hubs, propagating\nsemantic relationships to refine instance-level representations. To eliminate\nsemantic fragmentation and strengthen inter-tissue semantic associations, MiCo\nintegrates a Cluster Reducer module, which consolidates redundant anchors while\nenhancing information exchange between distinct semantic groups.

Their low cost and power consumption\ncharacteristics confer high commercial value. However, their reasoning\nabilities are limited by the number of parameters. To address this issue, this\npaper proposes a post-training optimization paradigm called the Incremental\nTraining Strategy to enhance the reasoning ability of SVLMs. Firstly, we\nconstructed a Self-Supervised Chain-of-Thought (COT) Data Construction System,\nwhich leverages multiple LVLMs with 7B parameters or more to transform original\ndata into COT data in a self-supervised manner. Our proposed Incremental\nTraining Strategy consists of four stages. Stage 1 injects domain knowledge by\nperforming Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to the pretrained model on the COT\ndata. Stage 2 aligns the COT data format by conducting a small amount of Group\nRelative Policy Optimization (GRPO) training constrained only by format rewards\non the COT data. Stage 3 enhances reasoning ability by applying GRPO training\non the COT data with constraints on both format and accuracy rewards. The\nresulting model shows significant improvement compared to the baseline. Stage 4\naddresses the limited capacity of the SVLMs and the weak ability to capture\ncomplex patterns by proposing ClipLow GRPO (CLGRPO) to constrain the capture\nspace of the training process.

This has inspired many recent works on mitigating\nmiscalibration, particularly through post-hoc recalibration methods that aim to\nobtain calibrated probabilities without sacrificing the classification\nperformance of pre-trained models. In this study, we summarize and categorize\nprevious works into three general strategies: intuitively designed methods,\nbinning-based methods, and methods based on formulations of ideal calibration.\nThrough theoretical and practical analysis, we highlight ten common limitations\nin previous approaches. To address these limitations, we propose a\nprobabilistic learning framework for calibration called h-calibration, which\ntheoretically constructs an equivalent learning formulation for canonical\ncalibration with boundedness. On this basis, we design a simple yet effective\npost-hoc calibration algorithm. Our method not only overcomes the ten\nidentified limitations but also achieves markedly better performance than\ntraditional methods, as validated by extensive experiments. We further analyze,\nboth theoretically and experimentally, the relationship and advantages of our\nlearning objective compared to traditional proper scoring rule. In summary, our\nprobabilistic framework derives an approximately equivalent differentiable\nobjective for learning error-bounded calibrated probabilities, elucidating the\ncorrespondence and convergence properties of computational statistics with\nrespect to theoretical bounds in canonical calibration.

Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs), which first predict a set of\nexplainable concepts from images and then perform classification based on these\nconcepts, are increasingly being adopted for explainable medical image\nclassification. However, the inherent explainability of CBMs introduces new\nchallenges when deploying trained models to new environments.

This design markedly improves grounding fidelity without sacrificing\nanswer accuracy. Despite using only 2B parameters, our method outperforms all\n7B-scale competitors. When scaled to 7B parameters, MUPA establishes new\nstate-of-the-art results, with Acc@GQA of 30.3% and 47.4% on NExT-GQA and\nDeVE-QA respectively, demonstrating MUPA' effectiveness towards trustworthy\nvideo-language understanding.

To address this, we propose Commutative\nVector Quantization (CommVQ) to significantly reduce memory usage for\nlong-context LLM inference. We first introduce additive quantization with a\nlightweight encoder and codebook to compress the KV cache, which can be decoded\nvia simple matrix multiplication. To further reduce computational costs during\ndecoding, we design the codebook to be commutative with Rotary Position\nEmbedding (RoPE) and train it using an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm.\nThis enables efficient integration of decoding into the self-attention\nmechanism. Our approach achieves high accuracy with additive quantization and\nlow overhead via the RoPE-commutative codebook. Experiments on long-context\nbenchmarks and GSM8K show that our method reduces FP16 KV cache size by 87.5%\nwith 2-bit quantization, while outperforming state-of-the-art KV cache\nquantization methods. Notably, it enables 1-bit KV cache quantization with\nminimal accuracy loss, allowing a LLaMA-3.1 8B model to run with a 128K context\nlength on a single RTX 4090 GPU.

When modeling heterogeneity and dynamics in\nreal-world complex networks, GRL methods designed for complex heterogeneous\ntemporal graphs (HTGs) have been proposed and have achieved successful\napplications in various fields. However, most existing GRL methods mainly focus\non preserving the low-order topology information while ignoring higher-order\ngroup interaction relationships, which are more consistent with real-world\nnetworks. In addition, most existing hypergraph methods can only model static\nhomogeneous graphs, limiting their ability to model high-order interactions in\nHTGs.

Thyroid\nnodules are frequently detected through ultrasound (US) imaging, and some\nrequire further evaluation via fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy.

This poses\na challenge for such models to obtain satisfactory performance in classifying\nleaf diseases with limited samples. This work proposes a few-shot learning\nframework, Domain-adapted Expert Network (DExNet), for plant disease\nclassification that compensates for the lack of sufficient training data by\ncombining observations of a number of expert critics. It starts with extracting\nthe feature embeddings as 'observations' from nine 'critics' that are\nstate-of-the-art pre-trained CNN-based architectures. These critics are 'domain\nadapted' using a publicly available leaf disease dataset having no overlapping\nclasses with the specific downstream task of interest.

These methods\ndepart fundamentally from traditional frequency-based algorithms such as\nApriori, FP-Growth, and Eclat, offering enhanced capabilities for incorporating\nprior knowledge, modeling uncertainty, item dependencies, probabilistic\ninference and adaptive search strategies. GPAR employs Gaussian processes to\nmodel item co-occurrence via feature representations, enabling principled\ninference, uncertainty quantification, and efficient generalization to unseen\nitemsets without retraining. BARM adopts a Bayesian framework with priors and\noptional correlation structures, yielding robust uncertainty quantification\nthrough full posterior distributions over item presence probabilities.

We first train a high-capacity vision\ntransformer (ViT) teacher model, pre-trained using I-JEPA self-supervised\nlearning, to classify fundus images into four classes: Normal, Diabetic\nRetinopathy, Glaucoma, and Cataract. We kept an Internet of Things (IoT) focus\nwhen compressing to a CNN-based student model for deployment in\nresource-limited conditions, such as the NVIDIA Jetson Nano. This was\naccomplished using a novel framework which included a Partitioned\nCross-Attention (PCA) projector, a Group-Wise Linear (GL) projector, and a\nmulti-view robust training method.

Our algorithm first predicts current\ntransition kernels by solving a linear optimization problem based on upper\nconfidence bounds and empirical transition probabilities calculated from data\nover a sliding window. Then, it computes the Whittle index associated with the\npredicted transition kernels. We design these sliding windows and upper\nconfidence bounds to guarantee sub-linear dynamic regret on the number of\nepisodes $T$, under the condition that transition kernels change slowly over\ntime (rate upper bounded by $\\epsilon=1/T^k$ with $k>0$). Furthermore, our\nproposed algorithm and regret analysis are designed to exploit prior domain\nknowledge and structural information of the RMABs to accelerate the learning\nprocess. Numerical results validate that our algorithm achieves superior\nperformance in terms of lowest cumulative regret relative to baselines in\nnon-stationary environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u672a\u77e5\u7684Whittle\u6307\u6570\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u548c\u7f6e\u4fe1\u4e0a\u754c\u4f18\u5316\u52a8\u6001\u9057\u61be\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u548c\u672a\u77e5\u73af\u5883\u4e0bRMABs\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f20\u7edfWhittle\u6307\u6570\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u9700\u8981\u5df2\u77e5\u4e14\u5e73\u7a33\u7684\u8f6c\u79fb\u6838\u800c\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u548c\u7f6e\u4fe1\u4e0a\u754c\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\u8f6c\u79fb\u6838\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97Whittle\u6307\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u52a0\u901f\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6b21\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u6001\u9057\u61be\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684RMABs\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Many of these tools\nwere initially developed in response to concerns with predictive AI and\ntherefore encode certain assumptions about the nature of AI systems and the\nutility of certain regulatory approaches. With the advent of generative AI,\nhowever, some of these assumptions no longer hold, even as policymakers attempt\nto maintain a single regulatory target that covers both types of AI.\n  In this paper, we identify four distinct aspects of generative AI that call\nfor meaningfully different policy responses. These are the generality and\nadaptability of generative AI that make it a poor regulatory target, the\ndifficulty of designing effective evaluations, new legal concerns that change\nthe ecosystem of stakeholders and sources of expertise, and the distributed\nstructure of the generative AI value chain.\n  In light of these distinctions, policymakers will need to evaluate where the\npast decade of policy work remains relevant and where new policies, designed to\naddress the unique risks posed by generative AI, are necessary. We outline\nthree recommendations for policymakers to more effectively identify regulatory\ntargets and leverage constraints across the broader ecosystem to govern\ngenerative AI.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u9884\u6d4b\u5f0fAI\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u73b0\u6709\u653f\u7b56\u5de5\u5177\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u9488\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7684\u65b0\u653f\u7b56\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u73b0\u6709AI\u76d1\u7ba1\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u653f\u7b56\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8bc6\u522b\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7684\u56db\u4e2a\u72ec\u7279\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5bf9\u653f\u7b56\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u9879\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "result": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u96be\u5ea6\u3001\u6cd5\u5f8b\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7ed3\u6784\u8981\u6c42\u65b0\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u5e94\u5bf9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u9700\u533a\u5206\u73b0\u6709\u653f\u7b56\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u9488\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u98ce\u9669\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b0\u653f\u7b56\u3002"}}

To address\nthis problem, we propose a two-stage approach to fully exploit multi-resolution\ninformation in the temporal domain and generate high quality frame-level pseudo\nlabels based on both appearance and motion streams. Specifically, in the first\nstage, we generate reliable initial frame-level pseudo labels, and in the\nsecond stage, we iteratively refine the pseudo labels and use a set of selected\nframes with highly confident pseudo labels to train neural networks and better\npredict action class scores at each frame. We fully exploit temporal\ninformation at multiple scales to improve temporal action localization\nperformance. Specifically, in order to obtain reliable initial frame-level\npseudo labels, in the first stage, we propose an Initial Label Generation (ILG)\nmodule, which leverages temporal multi-resolution consistency to generate high\nquality class activation sequences (CASs), which consist of a number of\nsequences with each sequence measuring how likely each video frame belongs to\none specific action class. In the second stage, we propose a Progressive\nTemporal Label Refinement (PTLR) framework. In our PTLR framework, two networks\ncalled Network-OTS and Network-RTS, which are respectively used to generate\nCASs for the original temporal scale and the reduced temporal scales, are used\nas two streams (i.e., the OTS stream and the RTS stream) to refine the pseudo\nlabels in turn.

To address these challenges, we\nevaluate model transfer from a pretraining mixture to each of its component\ntasks, assessing whether pretrained features can match the performance of\ntask-specific direct training. We identify a fundamental limitation in deep\nlearning models -- an \"information saturation bottleneck\" -- where networks\nfail to learn new features once they encode similar competing features during\ntraining.

This enables the effective separation of high-frequency and\nlow-frequency components, producing diverse frequency-specific representations.\nAdditionally, the k-space frequency distribution informs the generation of\nadaptive masks, which, in turn, guide a closed-loop diffusion process.\nExperimental results verified the ability of this method to learn specific\nfrequency information and thereby improved the quality of MRI reconstruction,\nproviding a flexible framework for optimizing k-space data using masks in the\nfuture.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a9\u7801\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff08AMDM\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8eMRI\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574k\u7a7a\u95f4\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9891\u7387\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5206\u79bb\u9ad8\u4f4e\u9891\u6210\u5206\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfMRI\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u5145\u5206\u8003\u8651k\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u4e0d\u540c\u9891\u7387\u533a\u57df\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u91cd\u5efa\u6548\u679c\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAMDM\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528k\u7a7a\u95f4\u9891\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u751f\u6210\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a9\u7801\uff0c\u6307\u5bfc\u95ed\u73af\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5206\u79bb\u9ad8\u4f4e\u9891\u6210\u5206\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u7279\u5b9a\u9891\u7387\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347MRI\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "AMDM\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a9\u7801\u4f18\u5316k\u7a7a\u95f4\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7075\u6d3b\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

We start by formally\ndefining and formulating the problem, then explore various attack goals, types,\nand variants based on the unique properties of SFT data in real-world\nscenarios. Based on our analysis of extraction behaviors of direct extraction,\nwe develop a novel extraction method specifically designed for SFT models,\ncalled Differentiated Data Extraction (DDE), which exploits the confidence\nlevels of fine-tuned models and their behavioral differences from pre-trained\nbase models.

This primary\nlimitation stems from the heavy reliance on domain-specific verifiers, which\nresults in prohibitive complexity and limited scalability. To address the\nchallenge, our key observation is that LLM's intrinsic probability of\ngenerating a correct free-form answer directly indicates its own evaluation of\nthe reasoning reward (i.e., how well the reasoning process leads to the correct\nanswer). Building on this insight, we propose RLPR, a simple verifier-free\nframework that extrapolates RLVR to broader general domains. RLPR uses the\nLLM's own token probability scores for reference answers as the reward signal\nand maximizes the expected reward during training. We find that addressing the\nhigh variance of this noisy probability reward is crucial to make it work, and\npropose prob-to-reward and stabilizing methods to ensure a precise and stable\nreward from LLM intrinsic probabilities.

Currently, high-quality verifiers are\neither unscalable (e.g., humans) or limited in utility (e.g., tools like Lean).\nWhile LM judges and reward models have become broadly useful as general-purpose\nverifiers, a significant performance gap remains between them and oracle\nverifiers (verifiers with perfect accuracy). To help close this gap, we\nintroduce Weaver, a framework for designing a strong verifier by combining\nmultiple weak, imperfect verifiers. We find weighted ensembles of verifiers,\nwhich typically require learning from labeled data, significantly outperform\nunweighted combinations due to differences in verifier accuracies. To reduce\ndependency on labeled data, Weaver leverages weak supervision to estimate each\nverifier's accuracy and combines outputs into a unified score that better\nreflects true response quality. However, directly applying weak supervision\nalgorithms poses challenges, including inconsistent verifier output formats and\nhandling low-quality verifiers. Weaver addresses these using dataset statistics\nto normalize outputs and filter specific verifiers. We study Weaver's\neffectiveness in test-time repeated sampling, where a model generates multiple\ncandidate responses and selects one.

In theory, the\nreconstruction should be simple - it just inverts and regenerates images by\nnumerically solving the Probability Flow-Ordinary Differential Equation\n(PF-ODE). Yet in practice, noticeable reconstruction errors have been observed,\nwhich cannot be well explained by numerical errors. In this work, we identify a\ndeeper intrinsic property in the PF-ODE generation process, the instability,\nthat can further amplify the reconstruction errors. The root of this\ninstability lies in the sparsity inherent in the generation distribution, which\nmeans that the probability is concentrated on scattered and small regions while\nthe vast majority remains almost empty.

Image Bias Scoring determines the appropriate bias\nscore of images via a ViT classifier. Text De-Biasing focuses on detecting\nbiased words and phrases and neutralizing them through BERT models. These three\nsteps all culminate to the final step of debiasing, which replaces the text and\nthe image with neutralized or reduced counterparts, which for images is done by\ncomparing the bias scores. The results so far indicate that this approach is\npromising, with the text debiasing strategy being able to identify many\npotential biased words and phrases, and the ViT model showcasing effective\ntraining. The semantic alignment model also is efficient. However, more time,\nparticularly in training, and resources are needed to obtain better results.

However, their enormous memory requirements make them prohibitively\nexpensive to fine-tune or deploy in resource-constrained environments. To\naddress this challenge, we introduce SlimMoE, a multi-stage compression\nframework for transforming large MoE models into much smaller, efficient\nvariants without incurring the prohibitive costs of training from scratch. Our\nmethod systematically reduces parameter counts by slimming experts and\ntransferring knowledge through intermediate stages, effectively mitigating the\nperformance degradation common in one-shot pruning approaches. Using this\nframework, we compress Phi 3.5-MoE (41.9B total/6.6B activated parameters) to\ncreate Phi-mini-MoE (7.6B total/2.4B activated parameters) and Phi-tiny-MoE\n(3.8B total/1.1B activated parameters) using only 400B tokens--less than 10% of\nthe original model's training data. These compressed models can be fine-tuned\non a single GPU (A100 for Phi-mini-MoE, A6000 for Phi-tiny-MoE), making them\nhighly suitable for academic and resource-limited settings. Our experiments\ndemonstrate that these compressed models outperform others of similar size and\nremain competitive with larger models.

Through the framework and our improved evaluation metrics,\nwe offer a promising direction in improving the logical reasoning of LLMs by\nbetter representing them in their logical formulations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6765\u6539\u8fdbLLMs\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6LogicPO\u548c\u4f7f\u7528DPO\u3001KTO\u7b49\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u903b\u8f91\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8bed\u6cd5\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dLLMs\u5728\u5c06\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u903b\u8f91\u5f62\u5f0f\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u6574\u4f53\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u5176\u903b\u8f91\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "1) \u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6LogicPO\uff1b2) \u4f7f\u7528DPO\u548cKTO\u7b49\u6280\u672f\u5fae\u8c03\u5f00\u6e90LLMs\u3002", "result": "\u6700\u4f73\u6a21\u578bPhi-3.5\u5728\u903b\u8f91\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u6bd4GPT-3.5-turbo\uff088-shot\uff09\u9ad8\u51fa10%\uff0c\u8bed\u6cd5\u9519\u8bef\u51cf\u5c1114%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u903b\u8f91\u8868\u793a\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347LLMs\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

We frame this challenge as Query-Evidence Asynchrony, where user\nqueries and their supporting evidence typically arrive asynchronously in the\nstreaming setting. This setting requires not only strong reasoning capabilities\nbut also the ability to retain past observations and respond to queries with\ntemporal awareness.

Our results indicate that ML models\njointly trained with federated learning yield significantly higher accuracy\nthan models trained by each chemical company individually and can perform\nsimilarly to models trained on combined datasets from all companies.

This\ndesign enables OmniGen2 to build upon existing multimodal understanding models\nwithout the need to re-adapt VAE inputs, thereby preserving the original text\ngeneration capabilities. To facilitate the training of OmniGen2, we developed\ncomprehensive data construction pipelines, encompassing image editing and\nin-context generation data. Additionally, we introduce a reflection mechanism\ntailored for image generation tasks and curate a dedicated reflection dataset\nbased on OmniGen2. Despite its relatively modest parameter size, OmniGen2\nachieves competitive results on multiple task benchmarks, including\ntext-to-image and image editing. To further evaluate in-context generation,\nalso referred to as subject-driven tasks, we introduce a new benchmark named\nOmniContext. OmniGen2 achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source\nmodels in terms of consistency.

While effective in balanced settings, conventional KD suffers\nsignificantly when applied to long-tailed data distributions, as the teacher\nmodel tends to be biased toward head classes and provides limited supervision\nfor tail classes. In this paper, we propose Long-Tailed Knowledge Distillation\n(LTKD), a novel framework tailored for class-imbalanced scenarios. We begin by\nreformulating the standard KD objective into two components: inter-group and\nintra-group Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, corresponding to the prediction\ndistributions across and within class groups (head, medium, tail),\nrespectively. This decomposition allows us to identify and quantify the sources\nof teacher bias. To address them, we introduce (1) a rebalanced inter-group\nloss that calibrates the teacher's group-level predictions and (2) a uniform\nintra-group loss that ensures equal contribution from all groups during\ndistillation. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100-LT, TinyImageNet-LT, and\nImageNet-LT show that LTKD consistently outperforms existing KD methods,\nachieving significant gains in both overall accuracy and tail-class\nperformance.

Existing methods\ntypically involve either prescribing the optimal diffusion process -- which\nonly works for heavily restricted problem formulations -- or require expensive\nsimulation to numerically obtain the time-dependent densities and sample from\nthe diffusion process. In contrast, we propose a coupled parameterization which\njointly models a time-dependent density function, or probability path, and the\ndynamics of a diffusion process that generates this probability path. To\naccomplish this, our approach directly bakes in the Fokker-Planck equation and\ndensity function requirements as hard constraints, by extending and greatly\nsimplifying the construction of Neural Conservation Laws. This enables\nsimulation-free training for a large variety of problem formulations, from\ndata-driven objectives as in generative modeling and dynamical optimal\ntransport, to optimality-based objectives as in stochastic optimal control,\nwith straightforward extensions to mean-field objectives due to the ease of\naccessing exact density functions.

To\nalleviate this issue, we propose two key strategies for incorporating\ntranslation equivariance: slide indexing and component stacking. Slide indexing\nmaintains operator responses at fixed positions, with sliding window attention\nbeing a notable example, while component stacking enables the arrangement of\ntranslation-equivariant operators in parallel or sequentially, thereby building\ncomplex architectures while preserving translation equivariance. However, these\nstrategies still create a dilemma in model design between the high\ncomputational cost of self-attention and the fixed receptive field associated\nwith sliding window attention.

The primary challenges involve maintaining consistency across\nmultiple views and effectively synthesizing shapes and textures under diverse\nconditions. In this paper, we propose the Multi-View Auto-Regressive (MV-AR)\nmethod, which leverages an auto-regressive model to progressively generate\nconsistent multi-view images from arbitrary prompts. Firstly, the\nnext-token-prediction capability of the AR model significantly enhances its\neffectiveness in facilitating progressive multi-view synthesis. When generating\nwidely-separated views, MV-AR can utilize all its preceding views to extract\neffective reference information. Subsequently, we propose a unified model that\naccommodates various prompts via architecture designing and training\nstrategies. To address multiple conditions, we introduce condition injection\nmodules for text, camera pose, image, and shape. To manage multi-modal\nconditions simultaneously, a progressive training strategy is employed. This\nstrategy initially adopts the text-to-multi-view (t2mv) model as a baseline to\nenhance the development of a comprehensive X-to-multi-view (X2mv) model through\nthe randomly dropping and combining conditions.

Existing encoder decoder based methods\ntypically compress inputs into low-dimensional bottlenecks on the assumption\nthat the compression process can effectively suppress the transmission of\nlogical anomalies to the decoder. However, logical anomalies present a\nparticular difficulty because, while their local features often resemble normal\nsemantics, their global semantics deviate significantly from normal patterns.\nThanks to the generalisation capabilities inherent in neural networks, these\nabnormal semantic features can propagate through low-dimensional bottlenecks.\nThis ultimately allows the decoder to reconstruct anomalous images with\nmisleading fidelity. To tackle the above challenge, we propose a novel\nnormality prior guided multi-semantic fusion network for unsupervised anomaly\ndetection. Instead of feeding the compressed bottlenecks to the decoder\ndirectly, we introduce the multi-semantic features of normal samples into the\nreconstruction process. To this end, we first extract abstract global semantics\nof normal cases by a pre-trained vision-language network, then the learnable\nsemantic codebooks are constructed to store representative feature vectors of\nnormal samples by vector quantisation. Finally, the above multi-semantic\nfeatures are fused and employed as input to the decoder to guide the\nreconstruction of anomalies to approximate normality. Extensive experiments are\nconducted to validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, and it achieves\nthe SOTA performance on the MVTec LOCO AD dataset with improvements of 5.7% in\npixel-sPRO and 2.6% in image-AUROC.

Our experimental results demonstrate that our\ntriangle-based method, in its vanilla version (without compactness tuning),\nachieves higher fidelity compared to state-of-the-art Gaussian-based methods.\nFurthermore, our approach produces reconstructed meshes with superior visual\nquality compared to existing mesh reconstruction methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e2D\u4e09\u89d2\u5f62\u9762\u7247\uff082DTS\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u66ff\u4ee33D\u9ad8\u65af\u57fa\u5143\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f3D\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6e32\u67d3\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u9ad8\u7ea7\u6e32\u67d3\u6548\u679c\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "3D\u9ad8\u65af\u57fa\u5143\u5728\u6e32\u67d3\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u9ad8\u7ea7\u6548\u679c\uff08\u5982\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u548c\u9634\u5f71\u6e32\u67d3\uff09\u4e0a\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f51\u683c\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u75282D\u4e09\u89d2\u5f62\u9762\u7247\u66ff\u4ee33D\u9ad8\u65af\u57fa\u5143\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7d27\u51d1\u6027\u53c2\u6570\u76f4\u63a5\u8bad\u7ec3\u903c\u771f\u7f51\u683c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u9ad8\u65af\u57fa\u5143\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u91cd\u5efa\u7f51\u683c\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7f51\u683c\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "2DTS\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8fde\u7eed\u4f53\u79ef\u5efa\u6a21\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6e32\u67d3\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Existing defenses have focused,\nimplicitly or explicitly, on single-patch attacks, leaving their sensitivity to\nthe number of patches as an open question or rendering them computationally\ninfeasible or inefficient against attacks consisting of multiple patches in the\nworst cases. In this work, we propose SpaNN, an attack detector whose\ncomputational complexity is independent of the expected number of adversarial\npatches. The key novelty of the proposed detector is that it builds an ensemble\nof binarized feature maps by applying a set of saliency thresholds to the\nneural activations of the first convolutional layer of the victim model. It\nthen performs clustering on the ensemble and uses the cluster features as the\ninput to a classifier for attack detection.

Our starting point is the well-studied\npairwise same-set queries which ask if a pair of elements belong to the same\nclass. It is known that non-adaptive algorithms require $\\Theta(n^2)$ queries,\nwhile adaptive algorithms require $\\Theta(nk)$ queries, and the best known\nalgorithm uses $k-1$ rounds. This problem has been studied extensively over the\nlast two decades in multiple communities due to its fundamental nature and\nrelevance to clustering, active learning, and crowd sourcing. In many\napplications, it is of high interest to reduce adaptivity while minimizing\nquery complexity. We give a complete characterization of the deterministic\nquery complexity of this problem as a function of the number of rounds, $r$,\ninterpolating between the non-adaptive and adaptive settings: for any constant\n$r$, the query complexity is\n$\\Theta(n^{1+\\frac{1}{2^r-1}}k^{1-\\frac{1}{2^r-1}})$. Our algorithm only needs\n$O(\\log \\log n)$ rounds to attain the optimal $O(nk)$ query complexity.\n  Next, we consider two generalizations of pairwise queries to subsets $S$ of\nsize at most $s$: (1) weak subset queries which return the number of classes\nintersected by $S$, and (2) strong subset queries which return the entire\npartition restricted on $S$. Once again in crowd sourcing applications, queries\non large sets may be prohibitive. For non-adaptive algorithms, we show\n$\\Omega(n^2/s^2)$ strong queries are needed. Perhaps surprisingly, we show that\nthere is a non-adaptive algorithm using weak queries that matches this bound up\nto log-factors for all $s \\leq \\sqrt{n}$.

The concept of\nrevocable biometrics was developed to address this concern. A biometric scheme\nis revocable if an individual can have their current enrollment in the scheme\nrevoked, so that the compromised biometric template becomes worthless, and the\nindividual can re-enroll with a new template that has similar recognition\npower. We show that modern deep CNN face matchers inherently allow for a robust\nrevocable biometric scheme. For a given state-of-the-art deep CNN backbone and\ntraining set, it is possible to generate an unlimited number of distinct face\nmatcher models that have both (1) equivalent recognition power, and (2)\nstrongly incompatible biometric templates. The equivalent recognition power\nextends to the point of generating impostor and genuine distributions that have\nthe same shape and placement on the similarity dimension, meaning that the\nmodels can share a similarity threshold for a 1-in-10,000 false match rate. The\nbiometric templates from different model instances are so strongly incompatible\nthat the cross-instance similarity score for images of the same person is\ntypically lower than the same-instance similarity score for images of different\npersons. That is, a stolen biometric template that is revoked is of less value\nin attempting to match the re-enrolled identity than the average impostor\ntemplate.

In this work, we explore using a\nMultimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to expand relevance judgments, creating\na new dataset of automated judgments. Specifically, we employ Gemini 1.5 Pro on\nthe ImageCLEFmed 2013 case-based retrieval task, simulating human assessment\nthrough an iteratively refined, structured prompting strategy that integrates\nbinary scoring, instruction-based evaluation, and few-shot learning. We\nsystematically experimented with various prompt configurations to maximize\nagreement with human judgments. To evaluate agreement between the MLLM and\nhuman judgments, we use Cohen's Kappa, achieving a substantial agreement score\nof 0.6, comparable to inter-annotator agreement typically observed in\nmultimodal retrieval tasks. Starting from the original 15,028 manual judgments\n(4.72% relevant) across 35 topics, our MLLM-based approach expanded the dataset\nby over 37x to 558,653 judgments, increasing relevant annotations to 5,950. On\naverage, each medical case query received 15,398 new annotations, with\napproximately 99% being non-relevant, reflecting the high sparsity typical in\nthis domain.

This task is particularly challenging when\nrelying on monocular video, where disentangling structure from motion is\nill-posed and supervision is scarce. We introduce Video Diffusion-Aware\nReconstruction (ViDAR), a novel 4D reconstruction framework that leverages\npersonalised diffusion models to synthesise a pseudo multi-view supervision\nsignal for training a Gaussian splatting representation. By conditioning on\nscene-specific features, ViDAR recovers fine-grained appearance details while\nmitigating artefacts introduced by monocular ambiguity. To address the\nspatio-temporal inconsistency of diffusion-based supervision, we propose a\ndiffusion-aware loss function and a camera pose optimisation strategy that\naligns synthetic views with the underlying scene geometry.

To guide future image generation, TAMMs introduces a\nSemantic-Fused Control Injection (SFCI) mechanism that adaptively combines\nhigh-level semantic reasoning and structural priors within an enhanced\nControlNet. This dual-path conditioning enables temporally consistent and\nsemantically grounded image synthesis.

A common approach\ninvolves using LIEF for raw feature extraction and the EMBER vectorizer to\ngenerate 2381-dimensional feature vectors.

This study\naddresses these challenges by applying two dimensionality reduction techniques:\nXGBoost-based feature selection and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). We\nevaluate three reduced feature dimensions (128, 256, and 384), which correspond\nto approximately 5.4%, 10.8%, and 16.1% of the original 2381 features, across\nfour models-XGBoost, LightGBM, Extra Trees, and Random Forest-using a unified\ntraining, validation, and testing split formed from the EMBER-2018, ERMDS, and\nBODMAS datasets. This approach ensures generalization and avoids dataset bias.\nExperimental results show that LightGBM trained on the 384-dimensional feature\nset after XGBoost feature selection achieves the highest accuracy of 97.52% on\nthe unified dataset, providing an optimal balance between computational\nefficiency and detection performance.

Our post-production stage emulates\nprofessional workflows by designing an Audience-Centric Cinematic Rhythm\nControl module, including Rough Cut and Fine Cut processes informed by\nsimulated audience feedback, for effective integration of audiovisual elements\nto achieve engaging content.

In contrast, multiband infrared imagery\nprovides richer spectral data, facilitating the preservation of finer details\nand enhancing semantic accuracy. In this paper, we propose a generative\nadversarial network (GAN)-based framework designed to integrate spectral\ninformation to enhance the colorization of infrared images. The framework\nemploys a multi-stage spectral self-attention Transformer network (MTSIC) as\nthe generator. Each spectral feature is treated as a token for self-attention\ncomputation, and a multi-head self-attention mechanism forms a spatial-spectral\nattention residual block (SARB), achieving multi-band feature mapping and\nreducing semantic confusion.

Unfortunately, those methods can give undesirable visual appearance\nchanges under magnification and may contain visible noise and flicker despite\nthe use of spatiotemporal denoisers.

Using GPU wave communication intrinsics,\nthis sharing can be performed inside actively executing shaders without memory\ntraffic overhead. We take this idea further and present novel algorithms that\nuse wave communication between lanes to avoid repeated texel decompression\nprior to filtering.

The\ndiscrepancy in data distributions across different operating conditions\ndegrades model performance when a model trained under one condition is applied\nto others. With the recent advancements in deep learning, transfer learning has\nbeen introduced to the fault diagnosis field as a paradigm for addressing\nmulti-condition fault diagnosis. Among these methods, domain generalization\napproaches can handle complex scenarios by extracting condition-invariant fault\nfeatures. Although many studies have considered fault diagnosis in specific\nmulti-condition scenarios, the extent to which operating conditions affect\nfault information has been scarcely studied, which is crucial. However, the\nextent to which operating conditions affect fault information has been scarcely\nstudied, which is crucial. When operating conditions have a significant impact\non fault features, directly applying domain generalization methods may lead the\nmodel to learn condition-specific information, thereby reducing its overall\ngeneralization ability. This paper investigates the performance of existing\nend-to-end domain generalization methods under varying conditions, specifically\nin variable-speed and variable-load scenarios, using multiple experiments on a\nreal-world gearbox. Additionally, a two-stage diagnostic framework is proposed,\naiming to improve fault diagnosis performance under scenarios with significant\noperating condition impacts. By incorporating a domain-generalized encoder with\na retraining strategy, the framework is able to extract condition-invariant\nfault features while simultaneously alleviating potential overfitting to the\nsource domain.

While recent work has\nshown that these techniques can be broken under dedicated reconstruction\nattacks, their impact on mechanistic interpretability has not been\nsystematically studied. In particular, it remains unclear whether scrambling a\nnetwork's internal representations truly thwarts efforts to understand how the\nmodel works, or simply relocates the same circuits to an unfamiliar coordinate\nsystem. We address this gap by analyzing a GPT-2-small model trained from\nscratch with a representative obfuscation map. Assuming the obfuscation map is\nprivate and the original basis is hidden (mirroring an honest-but-curious\nserver), we apply logit-lens attribution, causal path-patching, and\nattention-head ablation to locate and manipulate known circuits. Our findings\nreveal that obfuscation dramatically alters activation patterns within\nattention heads yet preserves the layer-wise computational graph. This\ndisconnect hampers reverse-engineering of user prompts: causal traces lose\ntheir alignment with baseline semantics, and token-level logit attributions\nbecome too noisy to reconstruct. At the same time, feed-forward and residual\npathways remain functionally intact, suggesting that obfuscation degrades\nfine-grained interpretability without compromising top-level task performance.\nThese results establish quantitative evidence that architectural obfuscation\ncan simultaneously (i) retain global model behaviour and (ii) impede\nmechanistic analyses of user-specific content.

While clients only share model updates with the aggregator,\nstudies reveal that aggregators can infer sensitive information from these\nupdates. Secure Aggregation (SA) protects individual updates during\ntransmission; however, recent work demonstrates a critical vulnerability where\nadversarial aggregators manipulate client selection to bypass SA protections,\nconstituting a Biased Selection Attack (BSA).

We propose Adversarial Robust Federated Learning (AdRo-FL), which\nsimultaneously enables: informed client selection based on client utility, and\nrobust defense against BSA maintaining privacy-preserving aggregation. AdRo-FL\nimplements two client selection frameworks tailored for distinct settings. The\nfirst framework assumes clients are grouped into clusters based on mutual\ntrust, such as different branches of an organization. The second framework\nhandles distributed clients where no trust relationships exist between them.\nFor the cluster-oriented setting, we propose a novel defense against BSA by (1)\nenforcing a minimum client selection quota from each cluster, supervised by a\ncluster-head in every round, and (2) introducing a client utility function to\nprioritize efficient clients. For the distributed setting, we design a\ntwo-phase selection protocol: first, the aggregator selects the top clients\nbased on our utility-driven ranking; then, a verifiable random function (VRF)\nensures a BSA-resistant final selection.

The project page:\n  https://github.com/deep-optimization/Morse", "summary": "In this paper, we present Morse, a simple dual-sampling framework for\naccelerating diffusion models losslessly. The key insight of Morse is to\nreformulate the iterative generation (from noise to data) process via taking\nadvantage of fast jump sampling and adaptive residual feedback strategies.\nSpecifically, Morse involves two models called Dash and Dot that interact with\neach other. The Dash model is just the pre-trained diffusion model of any type,\nbut operates in a jump sampling regime, creating sufficient space for sampling\nefficiency improvement. The Dot model is significantly faster than the Dash\nmodel, which is learnt to generate residual feedback conditioned on the\nobservations at the current jump sampling point on the trajectory of the Dash\nmodel, lifting the noise estimate to easily match the next-step estimate of the\nDash model without jump sampling. By chaining the outputs of the Dash and Dot\nmodels run in a time-interleaved fashion, Morse exhibits the merit of flexibly\nattaining desired image generation performance while improving overall runtime\nefficiency. With our proposed weight sharing strategy between the Dash and Dot\nmodels, Morse is efficient for training and inference. Our method shows a\nlossless speedup of 1.78X to 3.31X on average over a wide range of sampling\nstep budgets relative to 9 baseline diffusion models on 6 image generation\ntasks. Furthermore, we show that our method can be also generalized to improve\nthe Latent Consistency Model (LCM-SDXL, which is already accelerated with\nconsistency distillation technique) tailored for few-step text-to-image\nsynthesis.

The BLCB-CNN scheme uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)\narchitecture and an empirical approach to balance the distribution of pixels\nacross vessel and non-vessel classes and within thin and thick vessels. Level-I\nis used for vessel/non-vessel balancing and Level-II is used for thick/thin\nvessel balancing. Additionally, pre-processing of the input retinal fundus\nimage is performed by Global Contrast Normalization (GCN), Contrast Limited\nAdaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE), and gamma corrections to increase\nintensity uniformity as well as to enhance the contrast between vessels and\nbackground pixels. The resulting balanced dataset is used for\nclassification-based segmentation of the retinal vascular tree. We evaluate the\nproposed scheme on standard retinal fundus images and achieve superior\nperformance measures, including an area under the ROC curve of 98.23%, Accuracy\nof 96.22%, Sensitivity of 81.57%, and Specificity of 97.65%.

However, current state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) methods lack sufficient measures for consistent temporal evolution.\nNeural cellular automata (NCA) offer a robust and lightweight architecture to\nmodel evolving patterns between neighboring cells or pixels. In this work we\nintroduce TeNCA (Temporal Neural Cellular Automata), which extends and further\nrefines NCAs to effectively model temporally sparse, non-uniformly sampled\nimaging data. To achieve this, we advance the training strategy by enabling\nadaptive loss computation and define the iterative nature of the method to\nresemble a physical progression in time. This conditions the model to learn a\nphysiologically plausible evolution of contrast enhancement. We rigorously\ntrain and test TeNCA on a diverse breast MRI dataset and demonstrate its\neffectiveness, surpassing the performance of existing methods in generation of\nimages that align with ground truth post-contrast sequences.", "AI": {"tldr": "TeNCA\uff08Temporal Neural Cellular Automata\uff09\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7ec6\u80de\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u5bf9\u6bd4\u589e\u5f3a\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e73\u817aMRI\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u5316\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e73\u817aMRI\u7684\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u91c7\u96c6\u548c\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u5408\u6210\u5bf9\u6bd4\u589e\u5f3a\u53ef\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u9759\u8109\u6ce8\u5c04\u9020\u5f71\u5242\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u5316\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTeNCA\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u635f\u5931\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u7269\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u795e\u7ecf\u7ec6\u80de\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\uff08NCA\uff09\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u7a00\u758f\u548c\u975e\u5747\u5300\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u4e73\u817aMRI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cTeNCA\u751f\u6210\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u589e\u5f3a\u5e8f\u5217\u66f4\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "TeNCA\u4e3a\u5408\u6210\u5bf9\u6bd4\u589e\u5f3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u751f\u7406\u5b66\u5408\u7406\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u63a8\u52a8\u4e73\u817aMRI\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Existing vulnerability detection methods face two main\nissues: (1) Existing datasets lack comprehensive coverage and high-quality\nexplanations for preference learning.

Empirical analysis shows that even after continual pre-training (CPT)\nand supervised fine-tuning (SFT), LLMs may misinterpret the execution order of\nstate changes, resulting in incorrect explanations despite making correct\ndetection decisions. To address these challenges, we propose Smart-LLaMA-DPO\nbased on LLaMA-3.1-8B.

Second, we\nperform CPT using large-scale smart contract to enhance the LLM's understanding\nof specific security practices in smart contracts.

The completed matrix is often required to satisfy\nadditional structural constraints, such as positive semi-definiteness or a\nbounded infinity norm. The problem arises in various research fields, including\nmachine learning, statistics, and theoretical computer science, and has broad\nreal-world applications.\n  This paper presents new $\\mathsf{NP} $-hardness results for low-rank matrix\ncompletion problems. We show that for every sufficiently large integer $d$ and\nany real number $\\varepsilon \\in [ 2^{-O(d)},\\frac{1}{7}]$, given a partial\nmatrix $A$ with exposed values of magnitude at most $1$ that admits a positive\nsemi-definite completion of rank $d$, it is $\\mathsf{NP}$-hard to find a\npositive semi-definite matrix that agrees with each given value of $A$ up to an\nadditive error of at most $\\varepsilon$, even when the rank is allowed to\nexceed $d$ by a multiplicative factor of $O (\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon ^2 \\cdot\n\\log(1/\\varepsilon)} )$.

By establishing PBT as the core validation engine within\nthis iterative, closed-loop paradigm, Property-Generated Solver provides a\nrobust mechanism for steering LLMs towards more correct and generalizable code.\nExtensive experimental results on multiple code generation benchmarks\ndemonstrate that Property-Generated Solver achieves substantial pass@1\nimprovements, ranging from 23.1% to 37.3% relative gains over established TDD\nmethods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faProperty-Generated Solver\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08PBT\uff09\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9a71\u52a8\u5f00\u53d1\uff08TDD\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2aLLM\u4ee3\u7406\u534f\u4f5c\u63d0\u5347\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u786e\u4fdd\u5176\u8f93\u51fa\u529f\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u4ecd\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u3002\u4f20\u7edfTDD\u56e0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u7a00\u7f3a\u6216\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\uff08\u5982\u504f\u89c1\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6216\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\uff09\u800c\u6548\u679c\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faProperty-Generated Solver\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542bGenerator\uff08\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\uff09\u548cTester\uff08\u7ba1\u7406PBT\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u8bed\u4e49\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u53cd\u9988\uff09\u4e24\u4e2aLLM\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u4ee5PBT\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u9a8c\u8bc1\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cProperty-Generated Solver\u7684pass@1\u6307\u6807\u76f8\u5bf9TDD\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u534723.1%\u81f337.3%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7PBT\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548cLLM\u4ee3\u7406\u534f\u4f5c\uff0c\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

As a\nresult, power electronic-based distributed generators replaced synchronous\ngenerators which led to a change in the dynamic characteristics of the\nmicrogrid.

Our DGT integrates sequential graph structure changes into\nmulti-head self-attention via a differential graph mechanism, adaptively\npreserving high-value connections while suppressing noise.

We further\nevaluate correlation metrics (Pearson, Mutual Information, Spearman, Kendall's\nTau) across global/local/dual scopes as spatial-attention priors. Using 10\nyears of S&P 500 closing prices (z-score normalized; 64-day sliding windows),\nDGT with spatial priors outperformed GRU baselines (RMSE: 0.24 vs. 0.87).\nKendall's Tau global matrices yielded optimal results (MAE: 0.11).

Despite\ntheir widespread adoption, the internal decision-making processes of these\nagents remain largely unexplored, limiting our understanding of their\noperational dynamics and failure modes. In this paper, we present a large-scale\nempirical study of the thought-action-result trajectories of three\nstate-of-the-art LLM-based agents: \\textsc{RepairAgent},\n\\textsc{AutoCodeRover}, and \\textsc{OpenHands}. We unify their interaction logs\ninto a common format, capturing 120 trajectories and 2822 LLM interactions\nfocused on program repair and issue resolution. Our study combines quantitative\nanalyses of structural properties, action patterns, and token usage with\nqualitative assessments of reasoning coherence and feedback integration. We\nidentify key trajectory characteristics such as iteration counts and token\nconsumption, recurring action sequences, and the semantic coherence linking\nthoughts, actions, and their results. Our findings reveal behavioral motifs and\nanti-patterns that distinguish successful from failed executions, providing\nactionable insights for improving agent design, including prompting strategies,\nfailure diagnosis, and anti-pattern detection.

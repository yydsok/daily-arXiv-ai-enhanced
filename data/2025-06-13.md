### [1] [A Conjecture on a Fundamental Trade-Off between Certainty and Scope in Symbolic and Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10130)
*Luciano Floridi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个猜想，形式化了AI系统中可证明的正确性与广泛数据映射能力之间的基本权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI系统在设计时如何平衡严格的可证明正确性与处理高维数据的能力，揭示这一权衡对工程和哲学的影响。

Method: 通过信息论形式化这一猜想，并结合认识论、形式验证和技术哲学的讨论进行分析。

Result: 猜想明确了AI系统在零错误性能与广泛数据能力之间的不可调和性，对评估标准、治理框架和混合系统设计有深远影响。

Conclusion: 验证或反驳这一猜想对构建可信AI至关重要，需进一步研究以推动其发展。

Abstract: This article introduces a conjecture that formalises a fundamental trade-off
between provable correctness and broad data-mapping capacity in Artificial
Intelligence (AI) systems. When an AI system is engineered for deductively
watertight guarantees (demonstrable certainty about the error-free nature of
its outputs) -- as in classical symbolic AI -- its operational domain must be
narrowly circumscribed and pre-structured. Conversely, a system that can input
high-dimensional data to produce rich information outputs -- as in contemporary
generative models -- necessarily relinquishes the possibility of zero-error
performance, incurring an irreducible risk of errors or misclassification. By
making this previously implicit trade-off explicit and open to rigorous
verification, the conjecture significantly reframes both engineering ambitions
and philosophical expectations for AI. After reviewing the historical
motivations for this tension, the article states the conjecture in
information-theoretic form and contextualises it within broader debates in
epistemology, formal verification, and the philosophy of technology. It then
offers an analysis of its implications and consequences, drawing on notions of
underdetermination, prudent epistemic risk, and moral responsibility. The
discussion clarifies how, if correct, the conjecture would help reshape
evaluation standards, governance frameworks, and hybrid system design. The
conclusion underscores the importance of eventually proving or refuting the
inequality for the future of trustworthy AI.

### [2] [One Patient, Many Contexts: Scaling Medical AI Through Contextual Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10157)
*Michelle M. Li,Ben Y. Reis,Adam Rodman,Tianxi Cai,Noa Dagan,Ran D. Balicer,Joseph Loscalzo,Isaac S. Kohane,Marinka Zitnik*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 医学基础模型（如语言模型、视觉语言模型和多模态模型）在临床应用中存在动态适应性问题，容易因缺乏上下文调整而产生错误。本文提出一种“上下文切换”的医学AI愿景，旨在无需重新训练即可适应不同场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学AI模型在适应新场景（如不同人群、专科或工作流程）时需微调或检索知识库，导致其无法动态调整行为，易产生上下文错误。

Method: 提出“上下文切换”概念，使模型能动态适应不同专科、人群、工作流程和临床角色，无需重新训练。

Result: 通过上下文切换，模型可更灵活地诊断和管理疾病，扩大医疗服务覆盖范围。

Conclusion: 上下文切换是医学AI的未来方向，有望提升模型的适应性和临床实用性。

Abstract: Medical foundation models, including language models trained on clinical
notes, vision-language models on medical images, and multimodal models on
electronic health records, can summarize clinical notes, answer medical
questions, and assist in decision-making. Adapting these models to new
populations, specialties, or settings typically requires fine-tuning, careful
prompting, or retrieval from knowledge bases. This can be impractical, and
limits their ability to interpret unfamiliar inputs and adjust to clinical
situations not represented during training. As a result, models are prone to
contextual errors, where predictions appear reasonable but fail to account for
critical patient-specific or contextual information. These errors stem from a
fundamental limitation that current models struggle with: dynamically adjusting
their behavior across evolving contexts of medical care. In this Perspective,
we outline a vision for context-switching in medical AI: models that
dynamically adapt their reasoning without retraining to new specialties,
populations, workflows, and clinical roles. We envision context-switching AI to
diagnose, manage, and treat a wide range of diseases across specialties and
regions, and expand access to medical care.

### [3] [Correlation vs causation in Alzheimer's disease: an interpretability-driven study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10179)
*Hamzah Dabool,Raghad Mustafa*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了阿尔茨海默病研究中因果关系与相关性的区别，结合机器学习与统计方法，强调需谨慎解释关联数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 区分因果关系与相关性对阿尔茨海默病的诊断、治疗及病理机制研究至关重要。

Method: 采用XGBoost算法、相关矩阵分析和SHAP值解释技术，分析临床、认知、遗传和生物标志物特征。

Result: 发现强相关性不意味着因果关系，认知评分和遗传风险因素是关键分类特征。

Conclusion: 整合特征重要性与可解释性为未来因果推断研究奠定基础，有助于早期诊断和靶向干预。

Abstract: Understanding the distinction between causation and correlation is critical
in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research, as it impacts diagnosis, treatment, and
the identification of true disease drivers. This experiment investigates the
relationships among clinical, cognitive, genetic, and biomarker features using
a combination of correlation analysis, machine learning classification, and
model interpretability techniques. Employing the XGBoost algorithm, we
identified key features influencing AD classification, including cognitive
scores and genetic risk factors. Correlation matrices revealed clusters of
interrelated variables, while SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values
provided detailed insights into feature contributions across disease stages.
Our results highlight that strong correlations do not necessarily imply
causation, emphasizing the need for careful interpretation of associative data.
By integrating feature importance and interpretability with classical
statistical analysis, this work lays groundwork for future causal inference
studies aimed at uncovering true pathological mechanisms. Ultimately,
distinguishing causal factors from correlated markers can lead to improved
early diagnosis and targeted interventions for Alzheimer's disease.

### [4] [Towards Responsible AI: Advances in Safety, Fairness, and Accountability of Autonomous Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10192)
*Filip Cano*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了多种技术和方法，以提高AI系统的安全性、公平性、透明度和问责性，包括扩展安全屏蔽技术、引入公平屏蔽、量化行为意图，并通过“反应式决策”框架统一这些贡献。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自主系统对社会关键领域的影响日益增加，确保AI的负责任使用变得至关重要。然而，可信AI的概念仍然广泛且多面。

Method: 论文扩展了确定性屏蔽技术以应对延迟观测，引入公平屏蔽方法，提出量化行为意图的框架，并通过“反应式决策”框架统一这些方法。

Result: 在模拟自动驾驶中验证了安全屏蔽技术的有效性，公平屏蔽方法在有限和周期性时间范围内平衡了公平与干预成本，意图量化框架有助于确定责任。

Conclusion: 这些贡献为构建更安全、公平和可问责的AI系统提供了实用基础，并为未来可信AI研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Ensuring responsible use of artificial intelligence (AI) has become
imperative as autonomous systems increasingly influence critical societal
domains. However, the concept of trustworthy AI remains broad and
multi-faceted. This thesis advances knowledge in the safety, fairness,
transparency, and accountability of AI systems. In safety, we extend classical
deterministic shielding techniques to become resilient against delayed
observations, enabling practical deployment in real-world conditions. We also
implement both deterministic and probabilistic safety shields into simulated
autonomous vehicles to prevent collisions with road users, validating the use
of these techniques in realistic driving simulators. We introduce fairness
shields, a novel post-processing approach to enforce group fairness in
sequential decision-making settings over finite and periodic time horizons. By
optimizing intervention costs while strictly ensuring fairness constraints,
this method efficiently balances fairness with minimal interference. For
transparency and accountability, we propose a formal framework for assessing
intentional behaviour in probabilistic decision-making agents, introducing
quantitative metrics of agency and intention quotient. We use these metrics to
propose a retrospective analysis of intention, useful for determining
responsibility when autonomous systems cause unintended harm. Finally, we unify
these contributions through the ``reactive decision-making'' framework,
providing a general formalization that consolidates previous approaches.
Collectively, the advancements presented contribute practically to the
realization of safer, fairer, and more accountable AI systems, laying the
foundations for future research in trustworthy AI.

### [5] [WGSR-Bench: Wargame-based Game-theoretic Strategic Reasoning Benchmark for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10264)
*Qiyue Yin,Pei Xu,Qiaozhe Li,Shengda Liu,Shengqi Shen,Tong Wang,Yihong Han,Xiaonan Zhao,Likun Yang,Shiyue Cao,Shiyu Qiu,Yuxuan Liu,Shizhao Yu,Lei Cui,Chengxin Yan,Jie Sun,Xiangquan Tang,Kaiqi Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了WGSR-Bench，首个基于兵棋游戏的LLM战略推理基准，用于评估LLM在多智能体决策、意图推断和反事实推理中的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在数学、符号和常识推理方面表现出色，但战略推理（评估动态环境中多智能体行为、制定行动计划和调整策略的能力）尚未被系统评估或建模。

Method: 通过兵棋游戏作为评估环境，设计了WGSR-Bench，围绕环境态势感知、对手风险建模和政策生成三个核心任务构建测试样本，形成S-POE架构。

Result: 设计了一个基于LLM的兵棋游戏代理，用于全面评估战略推理能力。

Conclusion: WGSR-Bench旨在评估先进LLM在博弈论战略推理中的优势和局限，推动大模型驱动的战略智能研究。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to a
qualitative leap in artificial intelligence' s performance on reasoning tasks,
particularly demonstrating remarkable capabilities in mathematical, symbolic,
and commonsense reasoning. However, as a critical component of advanced human
cognition, strategic reasoning, i.e., the ability to assess multi-agent
behaviors in dynamic environments, formulate action plans, and adapt
strategies, has yet to be systematically evaluated or modeled. To address this
gap, this paper introduces WGSR-Bench, the first strategy reasoning benchmark
for LLMs using wargame as its evaluation environment. Wargame, a quintessential
high-complexity strategic scenario, integrates environmental uncertainty,
adversarial dynamics, and non-unique strategic choices, making it an effective
testbed for assessing LLMs' capabilities in multi-agent decision-making, intent
inference, and counterfactual reasoning. WGSR-Bench designs test samples around
three core tasks, i.e., Environmental situation awareness, Opponent risk
modeling and Policy generation, which serve as the core S-POE architecture, to
systematically assess main abilities of strategic reasoning. Finally, an
LLM-based wargame agent is designed to integrate these parts for a
comprehensive strategy reasoning assessment. With WGSR-Bench, we hope to assess
the strengths and limitations of state-of-the-art LLMs in game-theoretic
strategic reasoning and to advance research in large model-driven strategic
intelligence.

### [6] [Closer to Language than Steam: AI as the Cognitive Engine of a New Productivity Revolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10281)
*Xinmin Fang,Lingfeng Tao,Zhengxiong Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI被视为认知革命引擎，类似于书面语言对人类智力的变革性增强，而非机械化工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI如何作为认知生产力革命的驱动力，区别于工业革命的物理推动。

Method: 通过多学科视角（计算机科学、经济学、社会学）分析AI对知识工作的影响，并结合历史信息技术的飞跃进行比较。

Result: AI作为认知引擎，显著提升认知任务的生产力，并推动从体力到脑力生产力的转变。

Conclusion: AI的潜力在于补充人类认知能力，标志着生产力演变的新篇章，需重新思考技能、组织和政策。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reframed as a cognitive engine driving a
novel productivity revolution distinct from the Industrial Revolution's
physical thrust. This paper develops a theoretical framing of AI as a cognitive
revolution akin to written language - a transformative augmentation of human
intellect rather than another mechanized tool. We compare AI's emergence to
historical leaps in information technology to show how it amplifies knowledge
work. Examples from various domains demonstrate AI's impact as a driver of
productivity in cognitive tasks. We adopt a multidisciplinary perspective
combining computer science advances with economic insights and sociological
perspectives on how AI reshapes work and society. Through conceptual
frameworks, we visualize the shift from manual to cognitive productivity. Our
central argument is that AI functions as an engine of cognition - comparable to
how human language revolutionized knowledge - heralding a new productivity
paradigm. We discuss how this revolution demands rethinking of skills,
organizations, and policies. This paper, balancing academic rigor with clarity,
concludes that AI's promise lies in complementing human cognitive abilities,
marking a new chapter in productivity evolution.

### [7] [The Alignment Trap: Complexity Barriers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10304)
*Jasper Yao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文揭示了AI系统能力提升时安全验证的计算复杂性障碍，证明验证问题在系统表达能力超过临界值时是coNP完全的，并提出能力-风险动态（CRS）模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI能力的提升，社会对安全的需求趋近完美，但验证复杂性却呈指数增长，形成难以调和的矛盾。

Method: 通过四个核心定理，形式化分析了验证复杂性与系统表达能力的关系，以及安全策略的稀疏性。

Result: 验证复杂性随系统表达能力指数增长，安全策略在策略空间中占比极低，且无法通过有限对齐技术实现全覆盖。

Conclusion: AI发展面临三难选择：限制系统复杂性、接受不可验证风险或开发新安全范式。论文为AI对齐提供了首个系统性复杂性理论分析。

Abstract: We establish fundamental computational complexity barriers to verifying AI
safety as system capabilities scale. Our main results show that for AI systems
with expressiveness EXP$(m)$ above a critical threshold $\tau$, safety
verification requires exponential time and is coNP-complete. We formalize the
Capability-Risk Scaling (CRS) dynamic, which demonstrates how increasing AI
capability drives societal safety requirements toward perfection, creating an
inescapable tension with verification complexity. Through four core theorems,
we prove that (1) verification complexity grows exponentially with system
expressiveness, (2) safe policies comprise at most a $2^{-2^m}$ fraction of the
policy space, (3) no finite set of alignment techniques can provide universal
coverage, and (4) robust safety properties form measure-zero sets for neural
networks. These results characterize an "intractability gap" where practical
safety requirements fall within the region of computational intractability. We
conclude by presenting a strategic trilemma: AI development must either
constrain system complexity to maintain verifiable safety, accept unverifiable
risks while scaling capabilities, or develop fundamentally new safety paradigms
beyond verification. Our work provides the first systematic
complexity-theoretic analysis of AI alignment and establishes rigorous bounds
that any safety approach must confront. A formal verification of the core
theorems in Lean4 is currently in progress.

### [8] [A Benchmark for Generalizing Across Diverse Team Strategies in Competitive Pokémon](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10326)
*Cameron Angliss,Jiaxun Cui,Jiaheng Hu,Arrasy Rahman,Peter Stone*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出VGC-Bench基准，用于测试AI在多团队配置下的适应能力，发现现有方法在团队规模扩大时表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI在多团队配置下无需重新训练即可适应不同策略的挑战。

Method: 引入VGC-Bench基准，提供基础设施、评估协议、人类数据集及多种基线方法（如强化学习、博弈论方法）。

Result: 在单团队配置下，方法能击败专业选手；但团队规模扩大时，性能显著下降。

Conclusion: 跨团队策略的泛化能力仍是开放挑战，代码已开源。

Abstract: Developing AI agents that can robustly adapt to dramatically different
strategic landscapes without retraining is a central challenge for multi-agent
learning. Pok\'emon Video Game Championships (VGC) is a domain with an
extraordinarily large space of possible team configurations of approximately
$10^{139}$ - far larger than those of Dota or Starcraft. The highly discrete,
combinatorial nature of team building in Pok\'emon VGC causes optimal
strategies to shift dramatically depending on both the team being piloted and
the opponent's team, making generalization uniquely challenging. To advance
research on this problem, we introduce VGC-Bench: a benchmark that provides
critical infrastructure, standardizes evaluation protocols, and supplies
human-play datasets and a range of baselines - from large-language-model agents
and behavior cloning to reinforcement learning and empirical game-theoretic
methods such as self-play, fictitious play, and double oracle. In the
restricted setting where an agent is trained and evaluated on a single-team
configuration, our methods are able to win against a professional VGC
competitor. We extensively evaluated all baseline methods over progressively
larger team sets and find that even the best-performing algorithm in the
single-team setting struggles at scaling up as team size grows. Thus, policy
generalization across diverse team strategies remains an open challenge for the
community. Our code is open sourced at

*Zaijing Li,Yuquan Xie,Rui Shao,Gongwei Chen,Weili Guan,Dongmei Jiang,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Optimus-3的多模态大语言模型代理，通过知识增强数据生成、混合专家架构和多模态推理增强强化学习，解决了开放世界环境（如Minecraft）中代理开发的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在开放世界环境中构建具有感知、规划、行动、基础和反思能力的通用代理面临数据不足、任务干扰和视觉多样性等挑战。

Method: 1) 知识增强数据生成管道；2) 任务级路由的混合专家架构；3) 多模态推理增强强化学习方法。

Result: Optimus-3在Minecraft环境中超越了现有通用多模态大语言模型和先进代理。

Conclusion: Optimus-3通过创新方法成功解决了开放世界代理开发的挑战，并展示了卓越性能。

Abstract: Recently, agents based on multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
achieved remarkable progress across various domains. However, building a
generalist agent with capabilities such as perception, planning, action,
grounding, and reflection in open-world environments like Minecraft remains
challenges: insufficient domain-specific data, interference among heterogeneous
tasks, and visual diversity in open-world settings. In this paper, we address
these challenges through three key contributions. 1) We propose a
knowledge-enhanced data generation pipeline to provide scalable and
high-quality training data for agent development. 2) To mitigate interference
among heterogeneous tasks, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture
with task-level routing. 3) We develop a Multimodal Reasoning-Augmented
Reinforcement Learning approach to enhance the agent's reasoning ability for
visual diversity in Minecraft. Built upon these innovations, we present
Optimus-3, a general-purpose agent for Minecraft. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that Optimus-3 surpasses both generalist multimodal large
language models and existing state-of-the-art agents across a wide range of
tasks in the Minecraft environment. Project page:

*Jim O'Connor,Yeonghun Lee,Gary B Parker*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NeuroPAL结合NEAT和PAL，提升《星际争霸：母巢之战》中AI的进化训练效率，显著减少训练时间并涌现专家级策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于规则或监督深度学习的AI在适应性和计算效率上受限，需更高效的训练方法。

Method: NeuroPAL框架整合NEAT与PAL，通过交替低精度训练和高精度评估提升样本效率。

Result: PAL使训练时间减半，涌现代理兵营布置等专家策略。

Conclusion: PAL等结构化评估机制可增强神经进化在复杂RTS环境中的扩展性和效果。

Abstract: StarCraft: Brood War remains a challenging benchmark for artificial
intelligence research, particularly in the domain of macromanagement, where
long-term strategic planning is required. Traditional approaches to StarCraft
AI rely on rule-based systems or supervised deep learning, both of which face
limitations in adaptability and computational efficiency. In this work, we
introduce NeuroPAL, a neuroevolutionary framework that integrates
Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) with Punctuated Anytime Learning
(PAL) to improve the efficiency of evolutionary training. By alternating
between frequent, low-fidelity training and periodic, high-fidelity
evaluations, PAL enhances the sample efficiency of NEAT, enabling agents to
discover effective strategies in fewer training iterations. We evaluate
NeuroPAL in a fixed-map, single-race scenario in StarCraft: Brood War and
compare its performance to standard NEAT-based training. Our results show that
PAL significantly accelerates the learning process, allowing the agent to reach
competitive levels of play in approximately half the training time required by
NEAT alone. Additionally, the evolved agents exhibit emergent behaviors such as
proxy barracks placement and defensive building optimization, strategies
commonly used by expert human players. These findings suggest that structured
evaluation mechanisms like PAL can enhance the scalability and effectiveness of
neuroevolution in complex real-time strategy environments.

*Yuquan Xie,Zaijing Li,Rui Shao,Gongwei Chen,Kaiwen Zhou,Yinchuan Li,Dongmei Jiang,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种分层多模态技能模块（HMS）和技能增强蒙特卡洛树搜索算法（SA-MCTS），以解决多模态大语言模型（MLLM）在在线环境中执行长时任务时的知识不足和领域差距问题，并构建了Mirage-1 GUI代理和新基准AndroidLH。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM代理在在线环境中执行长时任务时面临知识不足和离线与在线领域差距的挑战。

Method: 提出HMS模块分层抽象知识，以及SA-MCTS算法减少在线搜索空间，构建Mirage-1代理和AndroidLH基准。

Result: Mirage-1在多个基准测试中表现优异，性能提升显著（32%、19%、15%、79%）。

Conclusion: HMS和SA-MCTS有效解决了知识不足和领域差距问题，Mirage-1在长时任务中表现卓越。

Abstract: Recent efforts to leverage the Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) as GUI
agents have yielded promising outcomes. However, these agents still struggle
with long-horizon tasks in online environments, primarily due to insufficient
knowledge and the inherent gap between offline and online domains. In this
paper, inspired by how humans generalize knowledge in open-ended environments,
we propose a Hierarchical Multimodal Skills (HMS) module to tackle the issue of
insufficient knowledge. It progressively abstracts trajectories into execution
skills, core skills, and ultimately meta-skills, providing a hierarchical
knowledge structure for long-horizon task planning. To bridge the domain gap,
we propose the Skill-Augmented Monte Carlo Tree Search (SA-MCTS) algorithm,
which efficiently leverages skills acquired in offline environments to reduce
the action search space during online tree exploration. Building on HMS, we
propose Mirage-1, a multimodal, cross-platform, plug-and-play GUI agent. To
validate the performance of Mirage-1 in real-world long-horizon scenarios, we
constructed a new benchmark, AndroidLH. Experimental results show that Mirage-1
outperforms previous agents by 32\%, 19\%, 15\%, and 79\% on AndroidWorld,
MobileMiniWob++, Mind2Web-Live, and AndroidLH, respectively. Project page:

TL;DR: 本文综述了推理代理式RAG方法，将其分为预定义推理和代理式推理两类，分析了代表性技术，并探讨了未来研究方向。


<details>

Motivation: 解决传统RAG系统在复杂推理、动态检索和多模态集成方面的不足。

Method: 将推理代理式RAG分为预定义推理（固定模块化流程）和代理式推理（模型自主协调工具交互），分析其架构设计和工具协调策略。

Result: 总结了代表性技术，提出了提升系统灵活性、鲁棒性和适用性的未来方向。

Conclusion: 推理代理式RAG是解决复杂任务的有效框架，未来需进一步优化其自适应能力和多模态集成。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful framework to
overcome the knowledge limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) by
integrating external retrieval with language generation. While early RAG
systems based on static pipelines have shown effectiveness in well-structured
tasks, they struggle in real-world scenarios requiring complex reasoning,
dynamic retrieval, and multi-modal integration. To address these challenges,
the field has shifted toward Reasoning Agentic RAG, a paradigm that embeds
decision-making and adaptive tool use directly into the retrieval process. In
this paper, we present a comprehensive review of Reasoning Agentic RAG methods,
categorizing them into two primary systems: predefined reasoning, which follows
fixed modular pipelines to boost reasoning, and agentic reasoning, where the
model autonomously orchestrates tool interaction during inference. We analyze
representative techniques under both paradigms, covering architectural design,
reasoning strategies, and tool coordination. Finally, we discuss key research
challenges and propose future directions to advance the flexibility,
robustness, and applicability of reasoning agentic RAG systems. Our collection
of the relevant research has been organized into a

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于代理的边缘计算弹性扩展框架，通过动态调整硬件资源和内部服务配置，在资源受限环境中最大化需求满足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩展方法在边缘计算中因资源限制而失效，需要更灵活的扩展行为。

Method: 引入基于代理的扩展框架，比较了四种代理类型（Active Inference、Deep Q Network、Analysis of Structural Knowledge、Deep Active Inference），并在YOLOv8和OpenCV服务上测试。

Result: 所有代理均满足SLO性能，但收敛模式不同：Deep Q Network依赖预训练，结构分析收敛快，Deep Active Inference兼具理论与实用性。

Conclusion: 多维度代理扩展在边缘环境中可行，值得进一步研究。

Abstract: Edge computing breaks with traditional autoscaling due to strict resource
constraints, thus, motivating more flexible scaling behaviors using multiple
elasticity dimensions. This work introduces an agent-based autoscaling
framework that dynamically adjusts both hardware resources and internal service
configurations to maximize requirements fulfillment in constrained
environments. We compare four types of scaling agents: Active Inference, Deep Q
Network, Analysis of Structural Knowledge, and Deep Active Inference, using two
real-world processing services running in parallel: YOLOv8 for visual
recognition and OpenCV for QR code detection. Results show all agents achieve
acceptable SLO performance with varying convergence patterns. While the Deep Q
Network benefits from pre-training, the structural analysis converges quickly,
and the deep active inference agent combines theoretical foundations with
practical scalability advantages. Our findings provide evidence for the
viability of multi-dimensional agent-based autoscaling for edge environments
and encourage future work in this research direction.

Abstract: As models become increasingly sophisticated, conventional algorithm
benchmarks are increasingly saturated, underscoring the need for more
challenging benchmarks to guide future improvements in algorithmic reasoning.
This paper introduces OIBench, a high-quality, private, and challenging
olympiad-level informatics dataset comprising 250 carefully curated original
problems. We detail the construction methodology of the benchmark, ensuring a
comprehensive assessment across various programming paradigms and complexities,
and we demonstrate its contamination-resistant properties via experiments. We
propose Time/Space Completion Curves for finer-grained efficiency analysis and
enable direct human-model comparisons through high-level participant
evaluations. Our experiments reveal that while open-source models lag behind
closed-source counterparts, current SOTA models already outperform most human
participants in both correctness and efficiency, while still being suboptimal
compared to the canonical solutions. By releasing OIBench as a fully
open-source resource (https://huggingface.co/datasets/AGI-Eval/OIBench), we
hope this benchmark will contribute to advancing code reasoning capabilities
for future LLMs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了Scientists' First Exam (SFE)基准，用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在科学认知能力上的表现，填补了现有基准在感知和推理能力评估上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前科学基准主要关注MLLMs的知识理解能力，而忽视了其感知和推理能力的评估，限制了其在科学发现中的应用潜力。

Method: 设计了SFE基准，包含830个专家验证的视觉问答对，涵盖三种问题类型和五个高价值学科的66项多模态任务。

Result: 实验显示，当前最先进的GPT-o3和InternVL-3在SFE上的表现仅为34.08%和26.52%，表明MLLMs在科学领域仍有较大提升空间。

Conclusion: SFE的提出为AI增强科学发现提供了新的评估工具，有望推动MLLMs在科学领域的进一步发展。

Abstract: Scientific discoveries increasingly rely on complex multimodal reasoning
based on information-intensive scientific data and domain-specific expertise.
Empowered by expert-level scientific benchmarks, scientific Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) hold the potential to significantly enhance this
discovery process in realistic workflows. However, current scientific
benchmarks mostly focus on evaluating the knowledge understanding capabilities
of MLLMs, leading to an inadequate assessment of their perception and reasoning
abilities. To address this gap, we present the Scientists' First Exam (SFE)
benchmark, designed to evaluate the scientific cognitive capacities of MLLMs
through three interconnected levels: scientific signal perception, scientific
attribute understanding, scientific comparative reasoning. Specifically, SFE
comprises 830 expert-verified VQA pairs across three question types, spanning
66 multimodal tasks across five high-value disciplines. Extensive experiments
reveal that current state-of-the-art GPT-o3 and InternVL-3 achieve only 34.08%
and 26.52% on SFE, highlighting significant room for MLLMs to improve in
scientific realms. We hope the insights obtained in SFE will facilitate further
developments in AI-enhanced scientific discoveries.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LogiPlan是一个新基准，用于评估大语言模型在逻辑规划和复杂关系结构推理中的能力，包含三个任务：计划生成、一致性检测和比较问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 逻辑关系推理对依赖LLMs生成和查询关系结构的应用（如网络基础设施、知识库或业务流程模式）至关重要。

Method: 通过控制对象数量、关系和关系链的最小深度动态调整任务复杂度，评估模型在不同难度下的表现。

Result: 评估了多个先进模型，发现性能差距与模型规模和架构相关，复杂配置下模型表现不佳。

Conclusion: 尽管推理增强模型在简单任务中表现良好，但在需要深度逻辑规划的复杂配置中仍有挑战。

Abstract: We introduce LogiPlan, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in logical planning and reasoning
over complex relational structures. Logical relational reasoning is important
for applications that may rely on LLMs to generate and query structured graphs
of relations such as network infrastructure, knowledge bases, or business
process schema. Our framework allows for dynamic variation of task complexity
by controlling the number of objects, relations, and the minimum depth of
relational chains, providing a fine-grained assessment of model performance
across difficulty levels. LogiPlan encompasses three complementary tasks: (1)
Plan Generation, where models must construct valid directed relational graphs
meeting specified structural constraints; (2) Consistency Detection, testing
models' ability to identify inconsistencies in relational structures; and (3)
Comparison Question, evaluating models' capacity to determine the validity of
queried relationships within a given graph. Additionally, we assess models'
self-correction capabilities by prompting them to verify and refine their
initial solutions. We evaluate state-of-the-art models including DeepSeek R1,
Gemini 2.0 Pro, Gemini 2 Flash Thinking, GPT-4.5, GPT-4o, Llama 3.1 405B,
O3-mini, O1, and Claude 3.7 Sonnet across these tasks, revealing significant
performance gaps that correlate with model scale and architecture. Our analysis
demonstrates that while recent reasoning-enhanced models show promising results
on simpler instances, they struggle with more complex configurations requiring
deeper logical planning.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了Primender序列，一种结合素数性和模数位条件的新整数序列，用于评估大型语言模型（LLMs）的符号推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要可解释的、基于规则的测试平台，以评估LLMs推断隐藏规则、验证数学假设和规模化推广符号逻辑的能力。

Method: 设计结构化提示和评估框架，测试多个先进LLMs在识别规则、验证假设和生成序列方面的表现。

Result: 提出了一种新的数学构造和可重复的方法论，用于在符号推理、假设测试和模式推广中评估LLMs。

Conclusion: Primender序列为连接数论、人工智能和软件工程领域提供了新工具和方法。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Primender sequence, a novel integer sequence
defined by a hybrid rule that combines classical primality with modular
digit-based conditions. Specifically, a number n is included in the sequence if
it is prime or ends with a prime number of unit digit or any length. In other
words, numbers which are primes or have at least one prime suffix. The
resulting sequence exhibits a deterministic yet non-trivial structure, blending
number-theoretic properties with symbolic patterning. We propose the Primender
sequence as a benchmark for evaluating the symbolic reasoning capabilities of
Large Language Models (LLMs). The study is motivated by the need for
interpretable, rule-based testbeds that can assess an LLM's ability to infer
hidden rules, validate mathematical hypotheses, and generalize symbolic logic
at scale. A key hypothesis explored is: Whenever a number in the Primender
sequence is exactly one more than the largest prime less than or equal to it,
the difference between it and the previous number in the sequence is also 1. We
design a structured prompt and evaluation framework to test this hypothesis
across multiple state-of-the-art LLMs, including ChatGPT, Copilot, DeepSeek,
Gemini, Grok, and LLaMA. The models are tasked with identifying the underlying
rule, validating the hypothesis, and generating the next 100,000 terms of the
sequence. Comparative metrics such as rule inference accuracy, hypothesis
evaluation, sequence validity, and symbolic explanation quality are used to
assess model performance. This work contributes a novel mathematical construct
and a reproducible methodology for benchmarking LLMs in symbolic reasoning,
hypothesis testing, and scalable pattern generalization - bridging the domains
of number theory, artificial intelligence, and software engineering.

Motivation: 复杂信息物理系统的诊断通常需要大量先验知识，但获取这些信息具有挑战性。

Method: 结合基于神经网络的症状生成器和新的图诊断算法，利用子系统间最小因果关系信息。

Result: 在模拟数据集中，82%的案例正确识别因果组件，73%的场景有效减少搜索空间；在真实数据集上验证了实用性。

Conclusion: 该方法在缺乏先验知识的复杂系统中具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Diagnostic processes for complex cyber-physical systems often require
extensive prior knowledge in the form of detailed system models or
comprehensive training data. However, obtaining such information poses a
significant challenge. To address this issue, we present a new diagnostic
approach that operates with minimal prior knowledge, requiring only a basic
understanding of subsystem relationships and data from nominal operations. Our
method combines a neural network-based symptom generator, which employs
subsystem-level anomaly detection, with a new graph diagnosis algorithm that
leverages minimal causal relationship information between
subsystems-information that is typically available in practice. Our experiments
with fully controllable simulated datasets show that our method includes the
true causal component in its diagnosis set for 82 p.c. of all cases while
effectively reducing the search space in 73 p.c. of the scenarios. Additional
tests on the real-world Secure Water Treatment dataset showcase the approach's
potential for practical scenarios. Our results thus highlight our approach's
potential for practical applications with large and complex cyber-physical
systems where limited prior knowledge is available.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of artificial intelligence in telecommunications has
raised interest in the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to address
domain-specific, mathematically intensive tasks. Although recent advancements
have improved the performance of LLMs in general mathematical reasoning, their
effectiveness within specialized domains, such as signal processing, network
optimization, and performance analysis, remains largely unexplored. To address
this gap, we introduce TeleMath, the first benchmark dataset specifically
designed to evaluate LLM performance in solving mathematical problems with
numerical solutions in the telecommunications domain. Comprising 500
question-answer (QnA) pairs, TeleMath covers a wide spectrum of topics in the
telecommunications field. This paper outlines the proposed QnAs generation
pipeline, starting from a selected seed of problems crafted by Subject Matter
Experts. The evaluation of a wide range of open-source LLMs reveals that best
performance on TeleMath is achieved by recent models explicitly designed for
mathematical or logical reasoning. In contrast, general-purpose models, even
those with a large number of parameters, often struggle with these challenges.
We have released the dataset and the evaluation code to ease result
reproducibility and support future research.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种将AutomationML（AML）建模约束形式化并验证的流程，通过映射到OWL本体、利用大型语言模型翻译规则为SHACL约束，并自动解释验证结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AML建模建议多为非正式的文本约束，无法自动验证，需一种形式化方法解决此问题。

Method: 将AML模型映射到OWL本体，利用RML和SPARQL；用大型语言模型将文本规则转为SHACL约束；验证并自动解释结果。

Result: 证明复杂建模规则可半自动检查，无需用户理解形式化方法或本体技术。

Conclusion: 提出的流程有效解决了AML约束自动验证问题，提升了建模效率。

Abstract: AutomationML (AML) enables standardized data exchange in engineering, yet
existing recommendations for proper AML modeling are typically formulated as
informal and textual constraints. These constraints cannot be validated
automatically within AML itself. This work-in-progress paper introduces a
pipeline to formalize and verify such constraints. First, AML models are mapped
to OWL ontologies via RML and SPARQL. In addition, a Large Language Model
translates textual rules into SHACL constraints, which are then validated
against the previously generated AML ontology. Finally, SHACL validation
results are automatically interpreted in natural language. The approach is
demonstrated on a sample AML recommendation. Results show that even complex
modeling rules can be semi-automatically checked -- without requiring users to
understand formal methods or ontology technologies.

Motivation: 结合答案集编程与可满足性模理论，以处理连续变化等复杂问题。

Method: 开发编译器aspsmt2smt，利用gringo部分接地输入程序，z3处理剩余变量。

Result: 系统能有效处理实数计算，支持连续变化推理。

Conclusion: ASPMT通过SMT求解器实现稳定模型计算，扩展了应用范围。

Abstract: Answer Set Programming Modulo Theories (ASPMT) is an approach to combining
answer set programming and satisfiability modulo theories based on the
functional stable model semantics. It is shown that the tight fragment of ASPMT
programs can be turned into SMT instances, thereby allowing SMT solvers to
compute stable models of ASPMT programs. In this paper we present a compiler
called {\sc aspsmt2smt}, which implements this translation. The system uses ASP
grounder {\sc gringo} and SMT solver {\sc z3}. {\sc gringo} partially grounds
input programs while leaving some variables to be processed by {\sc z3}. We
demonstrate that the system can effectively handle real number computations for
reasoning about continuous changes.

Abstract: Causal and temporal reasoning about video dynamics is a challenging problem.
While neuro-symbolic models that combine symbolic reasoning with neural-based
perception and prediction have shown promise, they exhibit limitations,
especially in answering counterfactual questions. This paper introduces a
method to enhance a neuro-symbolic model for counterfactual reasoning,
leveraging symbolic reasoning about causal relations among events. We define
the notion of a causal graph to represent such relations and use Answer Set
Programming (ASP), a declarative logic programming method, to find how to
coordinate perception and simulation modules. We validate the effectiveness of
our approach on two benchmarks, CLEVRER and CRAFT. Our enhancement achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the CLEVRER challenge, significantly
outperforming existing models. In the case of the CRAFT benchmark, we leverage
a large pre-trained language model, such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, as a proxy for a
dynamics simulator. Our findings show that this method can further improve its
performance on counterfactual questions by providing alternative prompts
instructed by symbolic causal reasoning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in solving
diverse tasks. However, their proficiency in iteratively optimizing complex
solutions through learning from previous feedback remains insufficiently
explored. To bridge this gap, we present OPT-BENCH, a comprehensive benchmark
designed to evaluate LLM agents on large-scale search space optimization
problems. OPT-BENCH includes 20 real-world machine learning tasks sourced from
Kaggle and 10 classical NP problems, offering a diverse and challenging
environment for assessing LLM agents on iterative reasoning and solution
refinement. To enable rigorous evaluation, we introduce OPT-Agent, an
end-to-end optimization framework that emulates human reasoning when tackling
complex problems by generating, validating, and iteratively improving solutions
through leveraging historical feedback. Through extensive experiments on 9
state-of-the-art LLMs from 6 model families, we analyze the effects of
optimization iterations, temperature settings, and model architectures on
solution quality and convergence. Our results demonstrate that incorporating
historical context significantly enhances optimization performance across both
ML and NP tasks. All datasets, code, and evaluation tools are open-sourced to
promote further research in advancing LLM-driven optimization and iterative
reasoning. Project page:

Motivation: 传统基于规则和统计的方法在模拟人类时空行为时存在计算成本高、泛化能力差和可扩展性不足的问题，而LLMs作为“世界模拟器”在时空推理方面也有局限性。

Method: 通过五阶段认知框架和六类MCP工具（时间管理、空间导航、环境感知、个人记忆、社会协作和经验评估）结合CoT推理，增强LLMs的时空行为模拟能力。

Result: 实验显示生成的样本与真实移动信号数据高度相似，生成质量得分在7.86至8.36之间，并行处理效率显著提升。

Conclusion: 该框架为城市行为建模提供了新方法，推动了LLMs在城市计算中的应用，并为智能城市规划、交通预测等提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Human spatiotemporal behavior simulation is critical for urban planning
research, yet traditional rule-based and statistical approaches suffer from
high computational costs, limited generalizability, and poor scalability. While
large language models (LLMs) show promise as "world simulators," they face
challenges in spatiotemporal reasoning including limited spatial cognition,
lack of physical constraint understanding, and group homogenization tendencies.
This paper introduces a framework integrating chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
with Model Context Protocol (MCP) to enhance LLMs' capability in simulating
spatiotemporal behaviors that correspond with validation data patterns. The
methodology combines human-like progressive reasoning through a five-stage
cognitive framework with comprehensive data processing via six specialized MCP
tool categories: temporal management, spatial navigation, environmental
perception, personal memory, social collaboration, and experience evaluation.
Experiments in Shanghai's Lujiazui district validate the framework's
effectiveness across 1,000 generated samples. Results demonstrate high
similarity with real mobile signaling data, achieving generation quality scores
of 7.86 to 8.36 across different base models. Parallel processing experiments
show efficiency improvements, with generation times decreasing from 1.30 to
0.17 minutes per sample when scaling from 2 to 12 processes. This work
contributes to integrating CoT reasoning with MCP for urban behavior modeling,
advancing LLMs applications in urban computing and providing a practical
approach for synthetic mobility data generation. The framework offers a
foundation for smart city planning, transportation forecasting, and
participatory urban design applications.

Abstract: Classical AI Planning techniques generate sequences of actions for complex
tasks. However, they lack the ability to understand planning tasks when
provided using natural language. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has
introduced novel capabilities in human-computer interaction. In the context of

Conclusion: ToxiMol为分子毒性修复提供了首个系统基准，为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Toxicity remains a leading cause of early-stage drug development failure.
Despite advances in molecular design and property prediction, the task of
molecular toxicity repair - generating structurally valid molecular
alternatives with reduced toxicity - has not yet been systematically defined or
benchmarked. To fill this gap, we introduce ToxiMol, the first benchmark task
for general-purpose Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) focused on
molecular toxicity repair. We construct a standardized dataset covering 11
primary tasks and 560 representative toxic molecules spanning diverse
mechanisms and granularities. We design a prompt annotation pipeline with
mechanism-aware and task-adaptive capabilities, informed by expert
toxicological knowledge. In parallel, we propose an automated evaluation
framework, ToxiEval, which integrates toxicity endpoint prediction, synthetic
accessibility, drug-likeness, and structural similarity into a high-throughput
evaluation chain for repair success. We systematically assess nearly 30
mainstream general-purpose MLLMs and design multiple ablation studies to
analyze key factors such as evaluation criteria, candidate diversity, and
failure attribution. Experimental results show that although current MLLMs
still face significant challenges on this task, they begin to demonstrate
promising capabilities in toxicity understanding, semantic constraint
adherence, and structure-aware molecule editing.

TL;DR: RLVR（带可验证奖励的强化学习）能在某些模型中激发强数学推理能力，即使奖励信号与正确答案无关。Qwen2.5-Math-7B在MATH-500上表现显著提升，但其他模型如Llama3或OLMo2未见类似效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨RLVR在缺乏有效奖励信号时如何通过预训练学习的有用推理表示提升模型性能。

Method: 使用RLVR，测试不同虚假奖励（如随机奖励、格式奖励、错误标签等）对模型数学推理能力的影响。

Result: Qwen2.5-Math-7B性能显著提升（最高27.1%），代码推理频率从65%增至90%以上，但其他模型未见类似效果。

Conclusion: RLVR可能通过预训练学习的推理表示发挥作用，但机制尚不明确。未来研究需验证多种模型，避免单一模型偏差。

Abstract: We show that reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) can elicit
strong mathematical reasoning in certain models even with spurious rewards that
have little, no, or even negative correlation with the correct answer. For
example, RLVR improves MATH-500 performance for Qwen2.5-Math-7B in absolute
points by 21.4% (random reward), 13.8% (format reward), 24.1% (incorrect
label), 26.0% (1-shot RL), and 27.1% (majority voting) -- nearly matching the
29.1% gained with ground truth rewards. However, the spurious rewards that work
for Qwen often fail to yield gains with other model families like Llama3 or
OLMo2. In particular, we find code reasoning -- thinking in code without actual
code execution -- to be a distinctive Qwen2.5-Math behavior that becomes
significantly more frequent after RLVR, from 65% to over 90%, even with
spurious rewards. Overall, we hypothesize that, given the lack of useful reward
signal, RLVR must somehow be surfacing useful reasoning representations learned
during pretraining, although the exact mechanism remains a topic for future
work. We suggest that future RLVR research should possibly be validated on
diverse models rather than a single de facto choice, as we show that it is easy
to get significant performance gains on Qwen models even with completely
spurious reward signals.

Conclusion: 未来研究应关注跨模态评估方法的发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly enhanced generative AI
capabilities across text, images, and audio. However, automatically evaluating
the quality of these generated outputs presents ongoing challenges. Although
numerous automatic evaluation methods exist, current research lacks a
systematic framework that comprehensively organizes these methods across text,
visual, and audio modalities. To address this issue, we present a comprehensive
review and a unified taxonomy of automatic evaluation methods for generated
content across all three modalities; We identify five fundamental paradigms
that characterize existing evaluation approaches across these domains. Our
analysis begins by examining evaluation methods for text generation, where
techniques are most mature. We then extend this framework to image and audio
generation, demonstrating its broad applicability. Finally, we discuss

TL;DR: TaskCraft是一个自动化工作流，用于生成可扩展、多工具且可验证的代理任务，解决了现有指令数据缺乏工具交互和人工标注成本高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代理任务在NLP和AI中日益重要，但现有数据缺乏工具交互且依赖人工标注，限制了可扩展性。

Method: TaskCraft通过深度和宽度扩展原子任务，生成结构化和层次化的复杂挑战。

Result: 实验表明，这些任务改进了生成工作流中的提示优化，并提升了代理基础模型的监督微调效果。

Conclusion: TaskCraft提供了一个大规模合成数据集（约36,000任务），支持未来代理调优和评估的研究。

Abstract: Agentic tasks, which require multi-step problem solving with autonomy, tool
use, and adaptive reasoning, are becoming increasingly central to the
advancement of NLP and AI. However, existing instruction data lacks tool
interaction, and current agentic benchmarks rely on costly human annotation,
limiting their scalability. We introduce \textsc{TaskCraft}, an automated
workflow for generating difficulty-scalable, multi-tool, and verifiable agentic
tasks with execution trajectories. TaskCraft expands atomic tasks using
depth-based and width-based extensions to create structurally and
hierarchically complex challenges. Empirical results show that these tasks
improve prompt optimization in the generation workflow and enhance supervised
fine-tuning of agentic foundation models. We present a large-scale synthetic
dataset of approximately 36,000 tasks with varying difficulty to support future
research on agent tuning and evaluation.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了语义退化对自然语言理解的影响，提出语言意义依赖于观察者的解释行为，并通过实验验证了语言解释的非经典语境性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于揭示大型语言模型（LLMs）和其他NLP系统在语义退化下的固有局限性，挑战传统语言意义独立存在的观点。

Method: 通过Kolmogorov复杂性理论分析，并结合语义贝尔不等式测试，使用LLM代理作为计算认知系统解释模糊词对。

Result: 实验结果显示CHSH期望值显著违反经典边界，表明语言解释在模糊性下表现出非经典语境性。

Conclusion: 结论指出经典频率分析方法在自然语言中必然有损，提出贝叶斯重复采样方法更适用于语境中的语言意义表征。

Abstract: Semantic degeneracy represents a fundamental property of natural language
that extends beyond simple polysemy to encompass the combinatorial explosion of
potential interpretations that emerges as semantic expressions increase in
complexity. Large Language Models (LLMs) and other modern NLP systems face
inherent limitations precisely because they operate within natural language
itself, making them subject to the same interpretive constraints imposed by
semantic degeneracy. In this work, we argue using Kolmogorov complexity that as
an expression's complexity grows, the likelihood of any interpreting agent
(human or LLM-powered AI) recovering the single intended meaning vanishes. This
computational intractability suggests the classical view that linguistic forms
possess meaning in and of themselves is flawed. We alternatively posit that
meaning is instead actualized through an observer-dependent interpretive act.
To test this, we conducted a semantic Bell inequality test using diverse LLM
agents as ``computational cognitive systems'' to interpret ambiguous word pairs
under varied contextual settings. Across several independent experiments, we
found average CHSH expectation values ranging from 1.2 to 2.8, with several
runs yielding values (e.g., 2.3-2.4) that significantly violate the classical
boundary ($|S|\leq2$). This demonstrates that linguistic interpretation under
ambiguity can exhibit non-classical contextuality, consistent with results from
human cognition experiments. These results inherently imply that classical
frequentist-based analytical approaches for natural language are necessarily
lossy. Instead, we propose that Bayesian-style repeated sampling approaches can
provide more practically useful and appropriate characterizations of linguistic
meaning in context.

TL;DR: AutoMind是一个自适应的大型语言模型（LLM）代理框架，通过专家知识库、树搜索算法和动态代码生成策略，提升了自动化数据科学的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM代理框架依赖固定工作流程和代码策略，难以处理复杂任务，缺乏人类专家的经验。

Method: AutoMind引入专家知识库、树搜索算法和自适应代码生成策略。

Result: 在数据科学基准测试中，AutoMind表现优于现有方法，具有高效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: AutoMind是迈向完全自动化数据科学的高效且稳健的一步。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have shown great potential in addressing
real-world data science problems. LLM-driven data science agents promise to
automate the entire machine learning pipeline, yet their real-world
effectiveness remains limited. Existing frameworks depend on rigid, pre-defined
workflows and inflexible coding strategies; consequently, they excel only on
relatively simple, classical problems and fail to capture the empirical
expertise that human practitioners bring to complex, innovative tasks. In this
work, we introduce AutoMind, an adaptive, knowledgeable LLM-agent framework
that overcomes these deficiencies through three key advances: (1) a curated
expert knowledge base that grounds the agent in domain expert knowledge, (2) an
agentic knowledgeable tree search algorithm that strategically explores
possible solutions, and (3) a self-adaptive coding strategy that dynamically
tailors code generation to task complexity. Evaluations on two automated data
science benchmarks demonstrate that AutoMind delivers superior performance
versus state-of-the-art baselines. Additional analyses confirm favorable
effectiveness, efficiency, and qualitative solution quality, highlighting
AutoMind as an efficient and robust step toward fully automated data science.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨模型在语义相同但表达不同的提示下行为的一致性，揭示模型评估的稳定性问题。

Method: 提出PBSS框架，应用于10个约束任务，分析模型响应差异。

Result: 发现模型在语义等效提示下存在一致的响应偏移，可能与分词和解码策略有关。

Conclusion: 提示的微小变化可能导致模型行为不稳定，分词和解码策略是潜在影响因素。

Abstract: We investigate how large language models respond to prompts that differ only
in their token-level realization but preserve the same semantic intent, a
phenomenon we call prompt variance. We propose Prompt-Based Semantic Shift
(PBSS), a diagnostic framework for measuring behavioral drift in LLMs under
semantically equivalent prompt rewordings. Applied to ten constrained tasks,
PBSS reveals consistent, model-specific response shifts, suggesting statistical
regularities linked to tokenization and decoding. These results highlight an
overlooked dimension of model evaluation stability under rephrasing and suggest
that tokenization strategies and decoding dynamics may contribute to
post-training quality of service instability.

TL;DR: 论文提出ChartReasoner，一种代码驱动的两阶段框架，用于在图表上实现精确且可解释的推理，解决了现有方法在视觉推理任务中丢失关键信息的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将视觉推理任务转换为文本推理任务时，常丢失关键的结构和语义信息，特别是在需要大量视觉细节的任务（如图表问答）中。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：1）训练高保真模型将图表图像转换为结构化ECharts代码；2）设计数据合成流水线生成推理轨迹，并结合监督微调和强化学习训练多模态模型。

Result: 在四个公共基准测试中表现优异，保留图表原始细节，性能接近GPT-4o等专有系统，且参数更少。

Conclusion: ChartReasoner在视觉推理任务中表现出色，为多模态推理提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, large language models have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities
through long-chain reasoning before responding. However, how to extend this
capability to visual reasoning tasks remains an open challenge. Existing
multimodal reasoning approaches transfer such visual reasoning task into
textual reasoning task via several image-to-text conversions, which often lose
critical structural and semantic information embedded in visualizations,
especially for tasks like chart question answering that require a large amount
of visual details. To bridge this gap, we propose ChartReasoner, a code-driven
novel two-stage framework designed to enable precise, interpretable reasoning
over charts. We first train a high-fidelity model to convert diverse chart
images into structured ECharts codes, preserving both layout and data semantics
as lossless as possible. Then, we design a general chart reasoning data
synthesis pipeline, which leverages this pretrained transport model to
automatically and scalably generate chart reasoning trajectories and utilizes a
code validator to filter out low-quality samples. Finally, we train the final
multimodal model using a combination of supervised fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning on our synthesized chart reasoning dataset and
experimental results on four public benchmarks clearly demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed ChartReasoner. It can preserve the original
details of the charts as much as possible and perform comparably with
state-of-the-art open-source models while using fewer parameters, approaching
the performance of proprietary systems like GPT-4o in out-of-domain settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于预训练语言模型的能力可能超越人类，高质量的人类监督难以获取，因此需要一种无需外部监督的方法来指导模型行为。

Method: 提出Internal Coherence Maximization (ICM)算法，利用模型自身生成的标签进行微调。

Result: 在多个任务中，ICM的性能与黄金监督训练相当，甚至优于众包人类监督训练，尤其在模型能力远超人类的任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: ICM方法能够显著提升前沿语言模型的训练效果，其无监督奖励模型和助手均优于人类监督的版本。

Abstract: To steer pretrained language models for downstream tasks, today's
post-training paradigm relies on humans to specify desired behaviors. However,
for models with superhuman capabilities, it is difficult or impossible to get
high-quality human supervision. To address this challenge, we introduce a new
unsupervised algorithm, Internal Coherence Maximization (ICM), to fine-tune
pretrained language models on their own generated labels, \emph{without
external supervision}. On GSM8k-verification, TruthfulQA, and Alpaca reward
modeling tasks, our method matches the performance of training on golden
supervision and outperforms training on crowdsourced human supervision. On
tasks where LMs' capabilities are strongly superhuman, our method can elicit
those capabilities significantly better than training on human labels. Finally,
we show that our method can improve the training of frontier LMs: we use our
method to train an unsupervised reward model and use reinforcement learning to
train a Claude 3.5 Haiku-based assistant. Both the reward model and the
assistant outperform their human-supervised counterparts.

Result: 专家一致性高但受框架子成分影响；LLMs接近专家水平，优于众包工作者。

Conclusion: LLMs在特定任务中表现可靠，可用于情感敏感应用，如对话伴侣。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating empathic responses in
text-based conversations. But, how reliably do they judge the nuances of
empathic communication? We investigate this question by comparing how experts,
crowdworkers, and LLMs annotate empathic communication across four evaluative
frameworks drawn from psychology, natural language processing, and
communications applied to 200 real-world conversations where one speaker shares
a personal problem and the other offers support. Drawing on 3,150 expert
annotations, 2,844 crowd annotations, and 3,150 LLM annotations, we assess
inter-rater reliability between these three annotator groups. We find that
expert agreement is high but varies across the frameworks' sub-components
depending on their clarity, complexity, and subjectivity. We show that expert
agreement offers a more informative benchmark for contextualizing LLM
performance than standard classification metrics. Across all four frameworks,
LLMs consistently approach this expert level benchmark and exceed the
reliability of crowdworkers. These results demonstrate how LLMs, when validated
on specific tasks with appropriate benchmarks, can support transparency and
oversight in emotionally sensitive applications including their use as
conversational companions.

Abstract: Research on understanding emotions in written language continues to expand,
especially for understudied languages with distinctive regional expressions and
cultural features, such as Bangla. This study examines emotion analysis using
22,698 social media comments from the EmoNoBa dataset. For language analysis,
we employ machine learning models: Linear SVM, KNN, and Random Forest with
n-gram data from a TF-IDF vectorizer. We additionally investigated how PCA
affects the reduction of dimensionality. Moreover, we utilized a BiLSTM model
and AdaBoost to improve decision trees. To make our machine learning models
easier to understand, we used LIME to explain the predictions of the AdaBoost
classifier, which uses decision trees. With the goal of advancing sentiment
analysis in languages with limited resources, our work examines various
techniques to find efficient techniques for emotion identification in Bangla.

Abstract: Human capital (HC) is increasingly important to corporate value creation.
Unlike other assets, however, HC is not currently subject to well-defined

trained on a confirmed set of HC disclosures to develop a comprehensive list of
HC-related keywords classified into five subcategories (DEI; health and safety;
labor relations and culture; compensation and benefits; and demographics and
other) that capture the multidimensional nature of HC management. We share our
lexicon, corporate HC disclosures, and the Python code used to develop the
lexicon, and we provide detailed examples of using our data and code, including
for fine-tuning a BERT model. Researchers can use our HC lexicon (or modify the
code to capture another construct of interest) with their samples of corporate
communications to address pertinent HC questions. We close with a discussion of
future research opportunities related to HC management and disclosure.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs在故事生成中的局限性，为游戏环境中应用LLM叙事规划提供了挑战与启示。

Abstract: Story generation has been a prominent application of Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, understanding LLMs' ability to produce high-quality stories
remains limited due to challenges in automatic evaluation methods and the high
cost and subjectivity of manual evaluation. Computational narratology offers
valuable insights into what constitutes a good story, which has been applied in
the symbolic narrative planning approach to story generation. This work aims to
deepen the understanding of LLMs' story generation capabilities by using them
to solve narrative planning problems. We present a benchmark for evaluating
LLMs on narrative planning based on literature examples, focusing on causal
soundness, character intentionality, and dramatic conflict. Our experiments
show that GPT-4 tier LLMs can generate causally sound stories at small scales,
but planning with character intentionality and dramatic conflict remains
challenging, requiring LLMs trained with reinforcement learning for complex
reasoning. The results offer insights on the scale of stories that LLMs can
generate while maintaining quality from different aspects. Our findings also
highlight interesting problem solving behaviors and shed lights on challenges
and considerations for applying LLM narrative planning in game environments.

<details>

Motivation: LLM通常基于文本数据训练，难以直接适应语音模态，尤其在语音数据有限的情况下。

Method: 采用调度交错语音-文本训练，逐步减少文本比例，促进从文本到语音的渐进模态适应。

Result: 在CVSS数据集上微调LLaMA3.2-1B模型，翻译性能显著提升，尤其在数据稀缺语言中。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了语音模态适应问题，提升了翻译性能。

Abstract: Speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) has been advanced with large language
models (LLMs), which are fine-tuned on discrete speech units. In such
approaches, modality adaptation from text to speech has been an issue. LLMs are
trained on text-only data, which presents challenges to adapt them to speech
modality with limited speech-to-speech data. To address the training
difficulty, we propose scheduled interleaved speech--text training in this
study. We use interleaved speech--text units instead of speech units during
training, where aligned text tokens are interleaved at the word level. We
gradually decrease the ratio of text as training progresses, to facilitate
progressive modality adaptation from text to speech. We conduct experimental
evaluations by fine-tuning LLaMA3.2-1B for S2ST on the CVSS dataset. We show
that the proposed method consistently improves the translation performances,
especially for languages with limited training data.

Abstract: Recent approaches have shown impressive proficiency in extracting and
leveraging parametric knowledge from Large-Language Models (LLMs) and
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). In this work, we consider how we can improve the
identification and retrieval of videos related to complex real-world events by
automatically extracting latent parametric knowledge about those events. We
present Q2E: a Query-to-Event decomposition method for zero-shot multilingual
text-to-video retrieval, adaptable across datasets, domains, LLMs, or VLMs. Our
approach demonstrates that we can enhance the understanding of otherwise overly
simplified human queries by decomposing the query using the knowledge embedded
in LLMs and VLMs. We additionally show how to apply our approach to both visual
and speech-based inputs. To combine this varied multimodal knowledge, we adopt
entropy-based fusion scoring for zero-shot fusion. Through evaluations on two
diverse datasets and multiple retrieval metrics, we demonstrate that Q2E
outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines. Our evaluation also shows that
integrating audio information can significantly improve text-to-video
retrieval. We have released code and data for future research.

Motivation: 尽管大型推理模型在STEM领域表现出强大的推理能力，但在更广泛的任务领域中的推理能力尚未充分探索。TTT-Bench旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出了一种可扩展的程序化方法，生成可验证的双人游戏问题，用于评估模型在战略、空间和逻辑推理方面的表现。

Result: 评估发现，擅长数学难题的模型在简单推理游戏中表现较差，平均得分比数学基准低41%和5%。

Conclusion: 大型推理模型在长期战略推理任务中存在明显短板，尤其是在简单和新任务中表现不佳。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities across a broad range of tasks including Olympiad-level
mathematical problems, indicating evidence of their complex reasoning
abilities. While many reasoning benchmarks focus on the STEM domain, the
ability of LRMs to reason correctly in broader task domains remains
underexplored. In this work, we introduce \textbf{TTT-Bench}, a new benchmark
that is designed to evaluate basic strategic, spatial, and logical reasoning
abilities in LRMs through a suite of four two-player Tic-Tac-Toe-style games
that humans can effortlessly solve from a young age. We propose a simple yet
scalable programmatic approach for generating verifiable two-player game
problems for TTT-Bench. Although these games are trivial for humans, they
require reasoning about the intentions of the opponent, as well as the game
board's spatial configurations, to ensure a win. We evaluate a diverse set of
state-of-the-art LRMs, and \textbf{discover that the models that excel at hard
math problems frequently fail at these simple reasoning games}. Further testing
reveals that our evaluated reasoning models score on average $\downarrow$ 41\%
\& $\downarrow$ 5\% lower on TTT-Bench compared to MATH 500 \& AIME 2024
respectively, with larger models achieving higher performance using shorter
reasoning traces, where most of the models struggle on long-term strategic
reasoning situations on simple and new TTT-Bench tasks.

Conclusion: 论文提出了未来研究方向，并公开了数据集和代码。

Abstract: Often when we interact with a first-person account of events, we consider
whether or not the narrator, the primary speaker of the text, is reliable. In
this paper, we propose using computational methods to identify unreliable
narrators, i.e. those who unintentionally misrepresent information. Borrowing
literary theory from narratology to define different types of unreliable
narrators based on a variety of textual phenomena, we present TUNa, a
human-annotated dataset of narratives from multiple domains, including blog
posts, subreddit posts, hotel reviews, and works of literature. We define
classification tasks for intra-narrational, inter-narrational, and
inter-textual unreliabilities and analyze the performance of popular
open-weight and proprietary LLMs for each. We propose learning from literature
to perform unreliable narrator classification on real-world text data. To this
end, we experiment with few-shot, fine-tuning, and curriculum learning
settings. Our results show that this task is very challenging, and there is
potential for using LLMs to identify unreliable narrators. We release our
expert-annotated dataset and code and invite future research in this area.

Result: 语料库在五个公开数据集上表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: ToxSyn-PT为低资源环境下的仇恨言论检测研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: We present ToxSyn-PT, the first large-scale Portuguese corpus that enables
fine-grained hate-speech classification across nine legally protected minority
groups. The dataset contains 53,274 synthetic sentences equally distributed
between minorities groups and toxicity labels. ToxSyn-PT is created through a
novel four-stage pipeline: (1) a compact, manually curated seed; (2) few-shot
expansion with an instruction-tuned LLM; (3) paraphrase-based augmentation; and
(4) enrichment, plus additional neutral texts to curb overfitting to
group-specific cues. The resulting corpus is class-balanced, stylistically
diverse, and free from the social-media domain that dominate existing

experiments on both binary and multi-label classification on the corpus yields
strong results across five public Portuguese hate-speech datasets,
demonstrating robust generalization even across domain boundaries. The dataset
is publicly released to advance research on synthetic data and hate-speech
detection in low-resource settings.

*Andrea Yaoyun Cui,Pengfei Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探讨语言模型是否具有贝叶斯大脑，发现其在某些条件下表现出近乎确定性决策，挑战了传统采样假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视语言模型是否具备贝叶斯大脑，并验证其决策模式是否真正随机。

Method: 通过模拟Gibbs采样实验，分析语言模型的决策模式，并提出区分随机与确定性行为的方法。

Result: 语言模型在非零采样温度下仍可表现出确定性决策，导致传统方法可能推断出错误的先验。

Conclusion: 提出新方法以区分决策模式，防止误导性先验推断，为理解语言模型决策提供关键见解。

Abstract: Language models are essentially probability distributions over token
sequences. Auto-regressive models generate sentences by iteratively computing
and sampling from the distribution of the next token. This iterative sampling
introduces stochasticity, leading to the assumption that language models make
probabilistic decisions, similar to sampling from unknown distributions.
Building on this assumption, prior research has used simulated Gibbs sampling,
inspired by experiments designed to elicit human priors, to infer the priors of
language models. In this paper, we revisit a critical question: Do language
models possess Bayesian brains? Our findings show that under certain
conditions, language models can exhibit near-deterministic decision-making,
such as producing maximum likelihood estimations, even with a non-zero sampling
temperature. This challenges the sampling assumption and undermines previous
methods for eliciting human-like priors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
without proper scrutiny, a system with deterministic behavior undergoing
simulated Gibbs sampling can converge to a "false prior." To address this, we
propose a straightforward approach to distinguish between stochastic and
deterministic decision patterns in Gibbs sampling, helping to prevent the
inference of misleading language model priors. We experiment on a variety of
large language models to identify their decision patterns under various
circumstances. Our results provide key insights in understanding decision
making of large language models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于梯度和聚类的数据选择框架ClusterUCB，通过聚类和修改的UCB算法高效选择数据样本，显著降低计算消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于梯度的数据选择方法计算资源消耗过大，难以实际应用，因此需要一种更高效的替代方案。

Method: 结合聚类和修改的UCB算法，将数据选择问题建模为多臂老虎机问题，利用历史梯度信息估计集群分布。

Result: 实验表明，ClusterUCB在保持性能的同时大幅减少了计算资源消耗。

Conclusion: ClusterUCB是一种高效且实用的数据选择框架，适用于大规模语言模型的微调。

Abstract: Gradient-based data influence approximation has been leveraged to select
useful data samples in the supervised fine-tuning of large language models.
However, the computation of gradients throughout the fine-tuning process
requires too many resources to be feasible in practice. In this paper, we
propose an efficient gradient-based data selection framework with clustering
and a modified Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm. Based on the intuition
that data samples with similar gradient features will have similar influences,
we first perform clustering on the training data pool. Then, we frame the
inter-cluster data selection as a constrained computing budget allocation
problem and consider it a multi-armed bandit problem. A modified UCB algorithm
is leveraged to solve this problem. Specifically, during the iterative sampling
process, historical data influence information is recorded to directly estimate
the distributions of each cluster, and a cold start is adopted to balance
exploration and exploitation. Experimental results on various benchmarks show
that our proposed framework, ClusterUCB, can achieve comparable results to the
original gradient-based data selection methods while greatly reducing computing
consumption.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Flick是一种针对低资源语言环境下少标签文本分类的新方法，通过优化伪标签质量提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言环境中少标签分类问题，避免现有方法因噪声伪标签和领域适应问题导致的性能下降。

Method: 提出伪标签细化组件，通过高置信度伪标签蒸馏和自适应top-k选择机制优化伪标签质量。

Result: 在14个多样化数据集（包括阿拉伯语、乌尔都语等低资源语言）上表现优异。

Conclusion: Flick在低资源语言环境下显著提升少标签分类性能，具有广泛适应性。

Abstract: Training deep learning networks with minimal supervision has gained
significant research attention due to its potential to reduce reliance on
extensive labelled data. While self-training methods have proven effective in
semi-supervised learning, they remain vulnerable to errors from noisy pseudo
labels. Moreover, most recent approaches to the few-label classification
problem are either designed for resource-rich languages such as English or
involve complex cascading models that are prone to overfitting. To address the
persistent challenge of few-label text classification in truly low-resource
linguistic contexts, where existing methods often struggle with noisy
pseudo-labels and domain adaptation, we propose Flick. Unlike prior methods
that rely on generic multi-cluster pseudo-labelling or complex cascading
architectures, Flick leverages the fundamental insight that distilling
high-confidence pseudo-labels from a broader set of initial clusters can
dramatically improve pseudo-label quality, particularly for linguistically
diverse, low-resource settings. Flick introduces a novel pseudo-label
refinement component, a departure from traditional pseudo-labelling strategies
by identifying and leveraging top-performing pseudo-label clusters. This
component specifically learns to distil highly reliable pseudo-labels from an
initial broad set by focusing on single-cluster cohesion and leveraging an
adaptive top-k selection mechanism. This targeted refinement process is crucial
for mitigating the propagation of errors inherent in low-resource data,
allowing for robust fine-tuning of pre-trained language models with only a
handful of true labels. We demonstrate Flick's efficacy across 14 diverse
datasets, encompassing challenging low-resource languages such as Arabic, Urdu,
and Setswana, alongside English, showcasing its superior performance and
adaptability.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了用户建议对大型语言模型（LLMs）在教育模拟场景中的影响，揭示了模型因迎合用户而表现出的偏差及其对教育公平的潜在风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探究LLMs在教育环境中是否会因用户提供的建议（尤其是错误答案）而改变其回答，从而影响学习效果和公平性。

Method: 测试了OpenAI的GPT-4o和GPT-4.1系列中的五个LLM模型，通过五种实验条件分析回答质量的变化，并研究了模型回答的“翻转”现象及词元级概率。

Result: 结果显示，当学生提到错误答案时，LLM的正确率可能下降15个百分点；提到正确答案时则提升15个百分点。较小模型的偏差更显著（如GPT-4.1-nano偏差达30%）。

Conclusion: 结论指出LLMs的迎合行为可能加剧教育不平等，需进一步研究其机制并开发缓解方法。

Abstract: This study examines how user-provided suggestions affect Large Language
Models (LLMs) in a simulated educational context, where sycophancy poses
significant risks. Testing five different LLMs from the OpenAI GPT-4o and
GPT-4.1 model classes across five experimental conditions, we show that
response quality varies dramatically based on query framing. In cases where the
student mentions an incorrect answer, the LLM correctness can degrade by as
much as 15 percentage points, while mentioning the correct answer boosts
accuracy by the same margin. Our results also show that this bias is stronger
in smaller models, with an effect of up to 30% for the GPT-4.1-nano model,
versus 8% for the GPT-4o model. Our analysis of how often LLMs "flip" their
answer, and an investigation into token level probabilities, confirm that the
models are generally changing their answers to answer choices mentioned by
students in line with the sycophancy hypothesis. This sycophantic behavior has
important implications for educational equity, as LLMs may accelerate learning
for knowledgeable students while the same tools may reinforce misunderstanding
for less knowledgeable students. Our results highlight the need to better
understand the mechanism, and ways to mitigate, such bias in the educational
context.

Conclusion: 该方法生成高质量推理数据，显著提升LLM推理效率与准确性。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision
has proven effective for enhancing their reasoning abilities. However,
obtaining reliable and accurate reasoning supervision remains a significant
challenge. We propose a scalable method for generating a high-quality CoT
supervision dataset by leveraging the determinism of program execution. Unlike
existing reasoning dataset generation methods that rely on costly human
annotations or error-prone LLM-generated CoT, our approach extracts verifiable,
step-by-step reasoning traces from code execution and transforms them into a
natural language CoT reasoning. Experiments on reasoning benchmarks across
various domains show that our method effectively equips LLMs with transferable
reasoning abilities across diverse tasks. Furthermore, the ablation studies
validate that our method produces highly accurate reasoning data and reduces
overall token length during inference by reducing meaningless repetition and
overthinking.

Motivation: 现有RAG方法在处理异构文档时存在局限性，尤其是表格数据的扁平化和分块策略破坏了结构，导致信息丢失和推理能力下降。

Method: TableRAG采用四步迭代操作：上下文敏感查询分解、文本检索、SQL编程与执行、组合中间答案生成。

Result: TableRAG在公开数据集和HeteQA基准上均优于现有基线，成为异构文档问答的新SOTA。

Conclusion: TableRAG通过统一文本理解和表格操作，有效解决了异构文档问答的挑战，并提供了开源实现。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has demonstrated considerable
effectiveness in open-domain question answering. However, when applied to
heterogeneous documents, comprising both textual and tabular components,
existing RAG approaches exhibit critical limitations. The prevailing practice
of flattening tables and chunking strategies disrupts the intrinsic tabular
structure, leads to information loss, and undermines the reasoning capabilities
of LLMs in multi-hop, global queries. To address these challenges, we propose
TableRAG, an hybrid framework that unifies textual understanding and complex
manipulations over tabular data. TableRAG iteratively operates in four steps:
context-sensitive query decomposition, text retrieval, SQL programming and
execution, and compositional intermediate answer generation. We also develop
HeteQA, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the multi-hop heterogeneous
reasoning capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that TableRAG
consistently outperforms existing baselines on both public datasets and our
HeteQA, establishing a new state-of-the-art for heterogeneous document question
answering. We release TableRAG at https://github.com/yxh-y/TableRAG/tree/main.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有验证方法依赖额外模型或多阶段训练，限制了扩展性。

Method: 提出PAG框架，通过多轮强化学习让LLM交替扮演生成和验证角色，选择性修正错误。

Result: PAG在推理任务中提升了生成和自校正准确性，验证能力优于自一致性方法。

Conclusion: PAG是一种简单有效的框架，联合提升了LLM的推理和验证能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
complex reasoning tasks, yet they still struggle to reliably verify the
correctness of their own outputs. Existing solutions to this verification
challenge often depend on separate verifier models or require multi-stage
self-correction training pipelines, which limit scalability. In this paper, we
propose Policy as Generative Verifier (PAG), a simple and effective framework
that empowers LLMs to self-correct by alternating between policy and verifier
roles within a unified multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm.
Distinct from prior approaches that always generate a second attempt regardless
of model confidence, PAG introduces a selective revision mechanism: the model
revises its answer only when its own generative verification step detects an
error. This verify-then-revise workflow not only alleviates model collapse but
also jointly enhances both reasoning and verification abilities. Extensive
experiments across diverse reasoning benchmarks highlight PAG's dual
advancements: as a policy, it enhances direct generation and self-correction
accuracy; as a verifier, its self-verification outperforms self-consistency.

Abstract: This paper introduces the TempVS benchmark, which focuses on temporal
grounding and reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) in image sequences. TempVS consists of three main tests (i.e., event
relation inference, sentence ordering and image ordering), each accompanied
with a basic grounding test. TempVS requires MLLMs to rely on both visual and
linguistic modalities to understand the temporal order of events. We evaluate
38 state-of-the-art MLLMs, demonstrating that models struggle to solve TempVS,
with a substantial performance gap compared to human capabilities. We also
provide fine-grained insights that suggest promising directions for future
research. Our TempVS benchmark data and code are available at

TL;DR: Tina是一系列高效低成本的小型推理模型，通过参数高效更新和低秩适应（LoRA）技术，在极低资源下实现与SOTA模型竞争的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何以低成本实现语言模型的强大推理能力。

Method: 使用LoRA技术对1.5B参数的基模型进行参数高效更新，结合强化学习（RL）训练。

Result: Tina模型在推理性能上超越或媲美SOTA模型，且训练成本极低（仅9美元）。

Conclusion: LoRA技术能高效适应RL奖励的推理结构，同时保留基模型知识，为低成本高性能推理提供了新方向。

Abstract: How cost-effectively can strong reasoning abilities be achieved in language
models? Driven by this fundamental question, we present Tina, a family of tiny
reasoning models achieved with high cost-efficiency. Notably, Tina demonstrates
that substantial reasoning performance can be developed using only minimal
resources, by applying parameter-efficient updates during reinforcement
learning (RL), using low-rank adaptation (LoRA), to an already tiny 1.5B
parameter base model. This minimalist approach produces models that achieve
reasoning performance which is competitive with, and sometimes surpasses, SOTA
RL reasoning models built upon the same base model. Crucially, this is achieved
at a tiny fraction of the computational post-training cost employed by existing
SOTA models. In fact, the best Tina model achieves a >20\% reasoning
performance increase and 43.33\% Pass@1 accuracy on AIME24, at only \$9 USD
post-training and evaluation cost (i.e., an estimated 260x cost reduction). Our
work reveals the surprising effectiveness of efficient RL reasoning via LoRA.
We validate this across multiple open-source reasoning datasets and various
ablation settings starting with a single, fixed set of hyperparameters.
Furthermore, we hypothesize that this effectiveness and efficiency stem from
LoRA rapidly adapting the model to the structural format of reasoning rewarded
by RL, while largely preserving the base model's underlying knowledge. In
service of accessibility and open research, we fully open-source all code,
training logs, and model weights \& checkpoints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前关于冲突框架的研究多为定性或仅关注表面框架，缺乏深入分析。本研究旨在通过计算语言学方法，更深入地探讨新闻媒体在冲突报道中的框架及其影响。

Method: 结合框架语义学和大型语言模型，分析新闻语料库中的战争与和平新闻指标，识别传播框架与语言框架的联系。

Result: 研究发现报道更偏向战争视角，且美、英和中东媒体在冲突描述中存在显著差异，揭示了媒体偏见。

Conclusion: 新闻媒体的框架选择可能加剧冲突，研究方法为未来冲突报道分析提供了新视角。

Abstract: Framing used by news media, especially in times of conflict, can have
substantial impact on readers' opinion, potentially aggravating the conflict
itself. Current studies on the topic of conflict framing have limited insights
due to their qualitative nature or only look at surface level generic frames
without going deeper. In this work, we identify indicators of war and peace
journalism, as outlined by prior work in conflict studies, in a corpus of news
articles reporting on the Israel-Palestine war. For our analysis, we use
computational approaches, using a combination of frame semantics and large
language models to identify both communicative framing and its connection to
linguistic framing. Our analysis reveals a higher focus on war based reporting
rather than peace based. We also show substantial differences in reporting
across the US, UK, and Middle Eastern news outlets in framing who the assailant
and victims of the conflict are, surfacing biases within the media.

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器（SAE）从源模型中捕获推理能力，并通过监督微调将其迁移到目标模型。

Result: SAE-Tuning在极低成本（约1美元）和短时间内（约20分钟）实现高性能推理（如43.33% Pass@1）。

Conclusion: SAE-Tuning提取的推理能力具有通用性和模块化特性，且开源所有成果。

Abstract: How cost-effectively can we elicit strong reasoning in language models by
leveraging their underlying representations? We answer this question with Resa,
a family of 1.5B reasoning models trained via a novel and efficient sparse
autoencoder tuning (SAE-Tuning) procedure. This method first trains an SAE to
capture reasoning abilities from a source model, and then uses the trained SAE
to guide a standard supervised fine-tuning process to elicit such abilities in
a target model, all using verified question-answer data without any reasoning
traces. Notably, when applied to certain base models before further RL
post-training, SAE-Tuning retains >97% of its RL-trained counterpart's
reasoning performance while reducing training costs by >2000x to roughly \$1
and training time by >450x to around 20 minutes. Furthermore, when applied to
lightly RL-trained models (e.g., within 1 hour on 2 GPUs), it enables reasoning
performance such as 43.33% Pass@1 on AIME24 and 90% Pass@1 on AMC23 for only
around \$1 additional cost. Surprisingly, the reasoning abilities extracted via
SAEs are potentially both generalizable and modular. Generality means abilities
extracted from one dataset still elevate performance on a larger and
overlapping corpus. Modularity means abilities extracted from Qwen or Qwen-Math
can be attached to the R1-Distill model at test time, without any retraining,
and yield comparable gains. Extensive ablations validate these findings and all
artifacts are fully open-sourced.

Result: 在GSM8K和MATH500数据集上缩短输出长度并保持或提升准确性；在AIME2024上提升准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了LLM推理的整体性能，尤其在复杂问题上表现更优。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant advancements in
reasoning capabilities, performing well on various challenging benchmarks.
Techniques like Chain-of-Thought prompting have been introduced to further
improve reasoning. However, these approaches frequently generate longer
outputs, which in turn increase computational latency. Although some methods
use reinforcement learning to shorten reasoning, they often apply uniform
penalties without considering the problem's complexity, leading to suboptimal
outcomes. In this study, we seek to enhance the efficiency of LLM reasoning by
promoting conciseness for simpler problems while preserving sufficient
reasoning for more complex ones for accuracy, thus improving the model's
overall performance. Specifically, we manage the model's reasoning efficiency
by dividing the reward function and including a novel penalty for output
length. Our approach has yielded impressive outcomes in benchmark evaluations
across three datasets: GSM8K, MATH500, and AIME2024. For the comparatively
simpler datasets GSM8K and MATH500, our method has effectively shortened output
lengths while preserving or enhancing accuracy. On the more demanding AIME2024
dataset, our approach has resulted in improved accuracy.

Motivation: 现有的科学主张验证方法仅预测最终标签，缺乏对模型推理的解释性，因此需要更透明的验证方法。

Method: 通过扩展SciTab数据集，添加人类标注的单元格级别理性标注，并构建分类法处理模糊案例。

Result: 实验显示，表格对齐信息能提升验证性能，但多数LLM的预测与人类标注不一致。

Conclusion: 模型预测的正确性可能并非源于忠实推理，需进一步改进解释性。

Abstract: Scientific claim verification against tables typically requires predicting
whether a claim is supported or refuted given a table. However, we argue that
predicting the final label alone is insufficient: it reveals little about the
model's reasoning and offers limited interpretability. To address this, we
reframe table-text alignment as an explanation task, requiring models to
identify the table cells essential for claim verification. We build a new
dataset by extending the SciTab benchmark with human-annotated cell-level
rationales. Annotators verify the claim label and highlight the minimal set of
cells needed to support their decision. After the annotation process, we
utilize the collected information and propose a taxonomy for handling ambiguous
cases. Our experiments show that (i) incorporating table alignment information
improves claim verification performance, and (ii) most LLMs, while often
predicting correct labels, fail to recover human-aligned rationales, suggesting
that their predictions do not stem from faithful reasoning.

Result: 预提示人物设定下模型表现差异微小；评分任务和薪资谈判建议中显示出显著偏见。

Conclusion: 随着LLM助手记忆和个性化趋势，偏见问题可能因模型已知用户社会人口特征而加剧。

Abstract: Modern language models are trained on large amounts of data. These data
inevitably include controversial and stereotypical content, which contains all
sorts of biases related to gender, origin, age, etc. As a result, the models
express biased points of view or produce different results based on the
assigned personality or the personality of the user. In this paper, we
investigate various proxy measures of bias in large language models (LLMs). We
find that evaluating models with pre-prompted personae on a multi-subject
benchmark (MMLU) leads to negligible and mostly random differences in scores.
However, if we reformulate the task and ask a model to grade the user's answer,
this shows more significant signs of bias. Finally, if we ask the model for
salary negotiation advice, we see pronounced bias in the answers. With the
recent trend for LLM assistant memory and personalization, these problems open
up from a different angle: modern LLM users do not need to pre-prompt the
description of their persona since the model already knows their
socio-demographics.

Conclusion: 研究强调了未来改进LLM以应对多用户DST场景的必要性，为更真实和鲁棒的DST模型铺路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
zero-shot dialogue state tracking (DST), reducing the need for task-specific
training. However, conventional DST benchmarks primarily focus on structured
user-agent conversations, failing to capture the complexities of real-world
multi-user interactions. In this study, we assess the robustness of LLMs in
multi-user DST while minimizing dataset construction costs. Inspired by recent
advances in LLM-based data annotation, we extend an existing DST dataset by
generating utterances of a second user based on speech act theory. Our
methodology systematically incorporates a second user's utterances into
conversations, enabling a controlled evaluation of LLMs in multi-user settings.
Experimental results reveal a significant performance drop compared to
single-user DST, highlighting the limitations of current LLMs in extracting and
tracking dialogue states amidst multiple speakers. Our findings emphasize the
need for future research to enhance LLMs for multi-user DST scenarios, paving
the way for more realistic and robust DST models.

due to a lack of background knowledge and a tendency to hallucinate. To address
these limitations, integrating knowledge graphs (KGs) with LLMs has been
intensively studied. Existing KG-enhanced LLMs focus on supplementary factual
knowledge, but still struggle with solving complex questions. We argue that
refining the relationships among facts and organizing them into a logically
consistent reasoning path is equally important as factual knowledge itself.
Despite their potential, extracting reliable reasoning paths from KGs poses the
following challenges: the complexity of graph structures and the existence of
multiple generated paths, making it difficult to distinguish between useful and
redundant ones. To tackle these challenges, we propose the RRP framework to
mine the knowledge graph, which combines the semantic strengths of LLMs with
structural information obtained through relation embedding and bidirectional
distribution learning. Additionally, we introduce a rethinking module that
evaluates and refines reasoning paths according to their significance.
Experimental results on two public datasets show that RRP achieves
state-of-the-art performance compared to existing baseline methods. Moreover,
RRP can be easily integrated into various LLMs to enhance their reasoning
abilities in a plug-and-play manner. By generating high-quality reasoning paths
tailored to specific questions, RRP distills effective guidance for LLM
reasoning.

Result: 在重建拉丁原始词形任务中，字符级准确性和音系合理性指标均显著提升。

Conclusion: 混合方法在原始词形重建中表现优越，为语言学研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: We propose an unsupervised method for the reconstruction of protoforms i.e.,
ancestral word forms from which modern language forms are derived. While prior
work has primarily relied on probabilistic models of phonological edits to
infer protoforms from cognate sets, such approaches are limited by their
predominantly data-driven nature. In contrast, our model integrates data-driven
inference with rule-based heuristics within an evolutionary optimization
framework. This hybrid approach leverages on both statistical patterns and
linguistically motivated constraints to guide the reconstruction process. We
evaluate our method on the task of reconstructing Latin protoforms using a
dataset of cognates from five Romance languages. Experimental results
demonstrate substantial improvements over established baselines across both
character-level accuracy and phonological plausibility metrics.

Abstract: This paper presents our system for Track 1: Mistake Identification in the BEA
2025 Shared Task on Pedagogical Ability Assessment of AI-powered Tutors. The
task involves evaluating whether a tutor's response correctly identifies a
mistake in a student's mathematical reasoning. We explore four approaches: (1)
an ensemble of machine learning models over pooled token embeddings from
multiple pretrained language models (LMs); (2) a frozen sentence-transformer
using [CLS] embeddings with an MLP classifier; (3) a history-aware model with
multi-head attention between token-level history and response embeddings; and
(4) a retrieval-augmented few-shot prompting system with a large language model
(LLM) i.e. GPT 4o. Our final system retrieves semantically similar examples,
constructs structured prompts, and uses schema-guided output parsing to produce
interpretable predictions. It outperforms all baselines, demonstrating the
effectiveness of combining example-driven prompting with LLM reasoning for
pedagogical feedback assessment. Our code is available at

Motivation: 探究LLMs在拼写过程中如何内部表示和利用字符级信息。

Method: 通过探测分类器、知识神经元识别和注意力权重检查三种分析验证机制。

Result: 发现嵌入层未完全编码字符级信息，中间层出现拼写行为的突破。

Conclusion: LLMs的字符级处理依赖中间层重建，而非简单的嵌入层编码。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can spell out tokens character by character with
high accuracy, yet they struggle with more complex character-level tasks, such
as identifying compositional subcomponents within tokens. In this work, we
investigate how LLMs internally represent and utilize character-level
information during the spelling-out process. Our analysis reveals that,
although spelling out is a simple task for humans, it is not handled in a
straightforward manner by LLMs. Specifically, we show that the embedding layer
does not fully encode character-level information, particularly beyond the
first character. As a result, LLMs rely on intermediate and higher Transformer
layers to reconstruct character-level knowledge, where we observe a distinct
"breakthrough" in their spelling behavior. We validate this mechanism through
three complementary analyses: probing classifiers, identification of knowledge
neurons, and inspection of attention weights.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检测威胁生命的语言对保护个体心理健康和预防潜在伤害至关重要。

Method: 通过微调三种开源LLMs（Gemma、Mistral、Llama-2）并与传统方法（如词袋模型、词嵌入、主题建模和BERT）进行比较。

Result: LLMs在平衡和不平衡数据场景下表现优于传统方法，Mistral和Llama-2表现最佳。上采样技术对传统方法有帮助，但对LLMs影响较小。

Conclusion: LLMs在现实世界的威胁生命语言检测中具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Detecting life-threatening language is essential for safeguarding individuals
in distress, promoting mental health and well-being, and preventing potential
harm and loss of life. This paper presents an effective approach to identifying
life-threatening texts using large language models (LLMs) and compares them
with traditional methods such as bag of words, word embedding, topic modeling,
and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. We fine-tune three
open-source LLMs including Gemma, Mistral, and Llama-2 using their 7B parameter
variants on different datasets, which are constructed with class balance,
imbalance, and extreme imbalance scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate a
strong performance of LLMs against traditional methods. More specifically,
Mistral and Llama-2 models are top performers in both balanced and imbalanced
data scenarios while Gemma is slightly behind. We employ the upsampling
technique to deal with the imbalanced data scenarios and demonstrate that while
this method benefits traditional approaches, it does not have as much impact on
LLMs. This study demonstrates a great potential of LLMs for real-world
life-threatening language detection problems.

TL;DR: PREMISE框架通过提示优化减少大型推理模型的冗余计算，保持准确性同时显著降低成本和令牌使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型推理模型（如Claude 3.7 Sonnet和OpenAI o1）在数学推理中生成冗长的思维链，增加了令牌使用和成本，限制了在延迟敏感或API受限场景中的部署。

Method: PREMISE结合轨迹级诊断和梯度启发式提示优化，通过多目标文本搜索平衡令牌长度和答案有效性，无需修改模型权重。

Result: 在GSM8K、SVAMP和Math500基准测试中，PREMISE保持或提升准确性（如Claude 96%→96%，Gemini 91%→92%），同时减少87.5%的推理令牌和69-82%的成本。

Conclusion: 提示级优化是高效推理的可行路径，无需牺牲推理质量。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet and OpenAI o1 achieve
strong performance on mathematical benchmarks using lengthy chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning, but the resulting traces are often unnecessarily verbose. This
inflates token usage and cost, limiting deployment in latency-sensitive or
API-constrained settings. We introduce PREMISE (PRompt-based Efficient
Mathematical Inference with Strategic Evaluation), a prompt-only framework that
reduces reasoning overhead without modifying model weights. PREMISE combines
trace-level diagnostics with gradient-inspired prompt optimization to minimize
redundant computation while preserving answer accuracy. The approach jointly
optimizes brevity and correctness through a multi-objective textual search that
balances token length and answer validity. Unlike prior work, PREMISE runs in a
single-pass black-box interface, so it can be applied directly to commercial
LLMs. On GSM8K, SVAMP, and Math500 we match or exceed baseline accuracy
($96\%\rightarrow96\%$ with Claude, $91\%\rightarrow92\%$ with Gemini) while
reducing reasoning tokens by up to $87.5\%$ and cutting dollar cost by
$69$--$82\%$. These results show that prompt-level optimization is a practical
and scalable path to efficient LRM inference without compromising reasoning
quality.

TL;DR: ClaimSpect框架通过层次化分解和检索增强生成技术，自动构建复杂声明的多角度分析，并提供语料库中的不同观点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂声明（如科学或政治声明）难以简单标记为‘真’或‘假’的问题，提供更全面的多角度验证。

Method: 提出ClaimSpect框架，通过层次化分解声明为子方面，检索语料库中的相关内容，并生成多角度观点。

Result: 在真实科学和政治声明数据集上验证了ClaimSpect的鲁棒性和准确性，优于多个基线方法。

Conclusion: ClaimSpect能有效解构复杂声明并展示语料库中的观点多样性，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Claims made by individuals or entities are oftentimes nuanced and cannot be
clearly labeled as entirely "true" or "false" -- as is frequently the case with
scientific and political claims. However, a claim (e.g., "vaccine A is better
than vaccine B") can be dissected into its integral aspects and sub-aspects
(e.g., efficacy, safety, distribution), which are individually easier to
validate. This enables a more comprehensive, structured response that provides
a well-rounded perspective on a given problem while also allowing the reader to
prioritize specific angles of interest within the claim (e.g., safety towards
children). Thus, we propose ClaimSpect, a retrieval-augmented generation-based
framework for automatically constructing a hierarchy of aspects typically
considered when addressing a claim and enriching them with corpus-specific
perspectives. This structure hierarchically partitions an input corpus to
retrieve relevant segments, which assist in discovering new sub-aspects.
Moreover, these segments enable the discovery of varying perspectives towards
an aspect of the claim (e.g., support, neutral, or oppose) and their respective
prevalence (e.g., "how many biomedical papers believe vaccine A is more
transportable than B?"). We apply ClaimSpect to a wide variety of real-world
scientific and political claims featured in our constructed dataset, showcasing
its robustness and accuracy in deconstructing a nuanced claim and representing
perspectives within a corpus. Through real-world case studies and human
evaluation, we validate its effectiveness over multiple baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学领域快速演变，传统专家分类耗时昂贵，现有自动方法或依赖特定语料库或忽略科学文献的多维性。

Method: TaxoAdapt利用LLM生成的分类法，通过迭代层次分类动态扩展分类的宽度和深度。

Result: TaxoAdapt在计算机科学会议数据上表现优异，分类细粒度提升26.51%，一致性提升50.41%。

Conclusion: TaxoAdapt能有效捕捉科学领域的动态演变，生成更细粒度且一致的分类。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of scientific fields introduces challenges in organizing
and retrieving scientific literature. While expert-curated taxonomies have
traditionally addressed this need, the process is time-consuming and expensive.
Furthermore, recent automatic taxonomy construction methods either (1)
over-rely on a specific corpus, sacrificing generalizability, or (2) depend
heavily on the general knowledge of large language models (LLMs) contained
within their pre-training datasets, often overlooking the dynamic nature of
evolving scientific domains. Additionally, these approaches fail to account for
the multi-faceted nature of scientific literature, where a single research
paper may contribute to multiple dimensions (e.g., methodology, new tasks,
evaluation metrics, benchmarks). To address these gaps, we propose TaxoAdapt, a
framework that dynamically adapts an LLM-generated taxonomy to a given corpus
across multiple dimensions. TaxoAdapt performs iterative hierarchical
classification, expanding both the taxonomy width and depth based on corpus'
topical distribution. We demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance across a
diverse set of computer science conferences over the years to showcase its
ability to structure and capture the evolution of scientific fields. As a
multidimensional method, TaxoAdapt generates taxonomies that are 26.51% more
granularity-preserving and 50.41% more coherent than the most competitive
baselines judged by LLMs.

Motivation: 多语言大语言模型在训练时面临模型容量有限、高质量数据稀缺和计算资源限制等问题，且分词器的语言覆盖不足导致训练后适应新语言困难。

Method: 提出使用通用分词器，覆盖比主训练语言更多的语言，以提升训练后的语言适应能力。

Result: 实验表明，通用分词器显著提高了语言适应能力，适应新语言的胜率提升达20.2%，对未见语言的适应能力也有5%的提升。

Conclusion: 通用分词器在扩展语言覆盖的同时，对主训练语言的性能影响极小，是一种高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Pretraining massively multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) for many
languages at once is challenging due to limited model capacity, scarce
high-quality data, and compute constraints. Moreover, the lack of language
coverage of the tokenizer makes it harder to address the gap for new languages
purely at the post-training stage. In this work, we study what relatively cheap
interventions early on in training improve "language plasticity", or adaptation
capabilities of the model post-training to new languages. We focus on tokenizer
design and propose using a universal tokenizer that is trained for more
languages than the primary pretraining languages to enable efficient adaptation
in expanding language coverage after pretraining. Our systematic experiments
across diverse groups of languages and different training strategies show that
a universal tokenizer enables significantly higher language adaptation, with up
to 20.2% increase in win rates compared to tokenizers specific to pretraining
languages. Furthermore, a universal tokenizer also leads to better plasticity
towards languages that are completely unseen in the tokenizer and pretraining,
by up to 5% win rate gain. We achieve this adaptation to an expanded set of
languages with minimal compromise in performance on the majority of languages
included in pretraining.

two datasets, eleven medical specialties, and six question types. We compare
standard single-generation and sampling-based methods, and present a case study
exploring simple, single-pass estimators based on behavioral signals in

Semantic Entropy while requiring only one generation. Our results reveal
substantial variation across specialties and question types, underscoring the
importance of selecting models based on both the nature of the question and

Result: 在NER-MIT-OpenCourseWare数据集上，命名实体的WER相对降低了30%。

Conclusion: LLM修正机制能有效提升ASR系统在命名实体识别上的准确性。

Abstract: With recent advances in modeling and the increasing amount of supervised
training data, automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have achieved
remarkable performance on general speech. However, the word error rate (WER) of
state-of-the-art ASR remains high for named entities. Since named entities are
often the most critical keywords, misrecognizing them can affect all downstream
applications, especially when the ASR system functions as the front end of a
complex system. In this paper, we introduce a large language model (LLM)
revision mechanism to revise incorrect named entities in ASR predictions by
leveraging the LLM's reasoning ability as well as local context (e.g., lecture
notes) containing a set of correct named entities. Finally, we introduce the
NER-MIT-OpenCourseWare dataset, containing 45 hours of data from MIT courses
for development and testing. On this dataset, our proposed technique achieves
up to 30\% relative WER reduction for named entities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言大模型在更新知识时面临跨语言参数干扰问题，现有方法成本高且效果不佳。

Method: LangEdit采用零空间约束框架，将参数更新投影到先前更新子空间的正交补空间，确保更新独立性。

Result: 在三种模型架构、六种语言和四项任务上的实验表明，LangEdit显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LangEdit为多语言大模型的高效准确知识更新提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Efficiently updating multilingual knowledge in large language models (LLMs),
while preserving consistent factual representations across languages, remains a
long-standing and unresolved challenge. While deploying separate editing
systems for each language might seem viable, this approach incurs substantial
costs due to the need to manage multiple models. A more efficient solution
involves integrating knowledge updates across all languages into a unified
model. However, performing sequential edits across languages often leads to
destructive parameter interference, significantly degrading multilingual
generalization and the accuracy of injected knowledge. To address this
challenge, we propose LangEdit, a novel null-space constrained framework
designed to precisely isolate language-specific knowledge updates. The core
innovation of LangEdit lies in its ability to project parameter updates for
each language onto the orthogonal complement of previous updated subspaces.
This approach mathematically guarantees update independence while preserving
multilingual generalization capabilities. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation
across three model architectures, six languages, and four downstream tasks,
demonstrating that LangEdit effectively mitigates parameter interference and
outperforms existing state-of-the-art editing methods. Our results highlight
its potential for enabling efficient and accurate multilingual knowledge
updates in LLMs. The code is available at

Result: 实验表明，ReCUT在多个数学推理数据集上显著减少推理长度30-50%，同时保持或提高准确性。

Conclusion: ReCUT有效平衡推理准确性和长度，优于现有基线方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting have substantially
improved the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
these methods often suffer from overthinking, leading to unnecessarily lengthy
or redundant reasoning traces. Existing approaches attempt to mitigate this
issue through curating multiple reasoning chains for training LLMs, but their
effectiveness is often constrained by the quality of the generated data and
prone to overfitting. To address the challenge, we propose Reasoning
Compression ThroUgh Stepwise Trials (ReCUT), a novel method aimed at balancing
the accuracy and length of reasoning trajectory. Specifically, ReCUT employs a
stepwise exploration mechanism and a long-short switched sampling strategy,
enabling LLMs to incrementally generate diverse reasoning paths. These paths
are evaluated and used to construct preference pairs to train two specialized
models (Gemini LLMs)-one optimized for reasoning accuracy, the other for
shorter reasoning. A final integrated model is obtained by interpolating the
parameters of these two models. Experimental results across multiple math
reasoning datasets and backbone models demonstrate that ReCUT significantly
reduces reasoning lengths by approximately 30-50%, while maintaining or
improving reasoning accuracy compared to various baselines. All codes and data
will be released via https://github.com/NEUIR/ReCUT.

Conclusion: SlowFast Sampling通过优化采样策略，充分释放了扩散语言模型在快速高质量生成上的潜力。

Abstract: Diffusion-based language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising
alternative to traditional autoregressive LLMs by enabling parallel token
generation and significantly reducing inference latency. However, existing
sampling strategies for dLLMs, such as confidence-based or semi-autoregressive
decoding, often suffer from static behavior, leading to suboptimal efficiency
and limited flexibility. In this paper, we propose SlowFast Sampling, a novel
dynamic sampling strategy that adaptively alternates between exploratory and
accelerated decoding stages. Our method is guided by three golden principles:
certainty principle, convergence principle, and positional principle, which
govern when and where tokens can be confidently and efficiently decoded. We
further integrate our strategy with dLLM-Cache to reduce redundant computation.
Extensive experiments across benchmarks and models show that SlowFast Sampling
achieves up to 15.63$\times$ speedup on LLaDA with minimal accuracy drop, and
up to 34.22$\times$ when combined with caching. Notably, our approach
outperforms strong autoregressive baselines like LLaMA3 8B in throughput,
demonstrating that well-designed sampling can unlock the full potential of
dLLMs for fast and high-quality generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨多语言环境下wav2vec2模型如何编码语音信息，尤其是非英语语言。

Method: 使用探测分类器和几何分析，研究音素、声调和说话者信息的表示。

Result: 所有语言中，音素、声调和说话者信息的子空间基本正交，层间模式相似，匹配语言在后期层略有优势。

Conclusion: wav2vec2的表示结构主要独立于预训练语音材料。

Abstract: Analyses of self-supervised speech models have begun to reveal where and how
they represent different types of information. However, almost all analyses
have focused on English. Here, we examine how wav2vec2 models trained on four
different languages encode both language-matched and non-matched speech. We use
probing classifiers and geometric analyses to examine how phones, lexical
tones, and speaker information are represented. We show that for all
pretraining and test languages, the subspaces encoding phones, tones, and
speakers are largely orthogonal, and that layerwise patterns of probing
accuracy are similar, with a relatively small advantage for matched-language
phone and tone (but not speaker) probes in the later layers. Our findings
suggest that the structure of representations learned by wav2vec2 is largely
independent of the speech material used during pretraining.

Result: 在MedDG和KaMed基准测试中，MedRef在生成质量和医学实体准确性上优于现有基线。

Conclusion: MedRef在真实医疗应用中表现出高效性和可靠性。

Abstract: Medical dialogue systems (MDS) have emerged as crucial online platforms for
enabling multi-turn, context-aware conversations with patients. However,
existing MDS often struggle to (1) identify relevant medical knowledge and (2)
generate personalized, medically accurate responses. To address these
challenges, we propose MedRef, a novel MDS that incorporates knowledge refining
and dynamic prompt adjustment. First, we employ a knowledge refining mechanism
to filter out irrelevant medical data, improving predictions of critical
medical entities in responses. Additionally, we design a comprehensive prompt
structure that incorporates historical details and evident details. To enable
real-time adaptability to diverse patient conditions, we implement two key
modules, Triplet Filter and Demo Selector, providing appropriate knowledge and
demonstrations equipped in the system prompt. Extensive experiments on MedDG
and KaMed benchmarks show that MedRef outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in
both generation quality and medical entity accuracy, underscoring its
effectiveness and reliability for real-world healthcare applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大语言模型（LLMs）通过微调获取新知识时的双重性：既能从新事实中泛化，又容易产生幻觉。作者提出这种现象源于一种称为‘上下文外推理’（OCR）的机制，并通过实验和理论分析验证了其作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在解释LLMs在微调中表现出的双重性（泛化与幻觉），揭示其背后的统一机制。

Method: 通过实验验证OCR在五种主流LLMs中的作用，并设计合成事实回忆任务，分析单层单头注意力模型的性能。

Result: OCR机制是泛化和幻觉的共同原因，矩阵分解对模型性能至关重要，梯度下降的隐式偏好解释了OCR的高效学习能力。

Conclusion: 研究为OCR现象提供了理论框架，为分析和缓解知识注入中的不良行为提供了新视角。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can acquire new knowledge through fine-tuning,
but this process exhibits a puzzling duality: models can generalize remarkably
from new facts, yet are also prone to hallucinating incorrect information.
However, the reasons for this phenomenon remain poorly understood. In this
work, we argue that both behaviors stem from a single mechanism known as
out-of-context reasoning (OCR): the ability to deduce implications by
associating concepts, even those without a causal link. Our experiments across
five prominent LLMs confirm that OCR indeed drives both generalization and
hallucination, depending on whether the associated concepts are causally
related. To build a rigorous theoretical understanding of this phenomenon, we
then formalize OCR as a synthetic factual recall task. We empirically show that
a one-layer single-head attention-only transformer with factorized output and
value matrices can learn to solve this task, while a model with combined
weights cannot, highlighting the crucial role of matrix factorization. Our
theoretical analysis shows that the OCR capability can be attributed to the
implicit bias of gradient descent, which favors solutions that minimize the
nuclear norm of the combined output-value matrix. This mathematical structure
explains why the model learns to associate facts and implications with high
sample efficiency, regardless of whether the correlation is causal or merely
spurious. Ultimately, our work provides a theoretical foundation for
understanding the OCR phenomenon, offering a new lens for analyzing and
mitigating undesirable behaviors from knowledge injection.

Conclusion: BioClinical ModernBERT为生物医学和临床NLP提供了高效且适应性强的解决方案。

Abstract: Encoder-based transformer models are central to biomedical and clinical
Natural Language Processing (NLP), as their bidirectional self-attention makes
them well-suited for efficiently extracting structured information from
unstructured text through discriminative tasks. However, encoders have seen
slower development compared to decoder models, leading to limited domain
adaptation in biomedical and clinical settings. We introduce BioClinical
ModernBERT, a domain-adapted encoder that builds on the recent ModernBERT
release, incorporating long-context processing and substantial improvements in
speed and performance for biomedical and clinical NLP. BioClinical ModernBERT
is developed through continued pretraining on the largest biomedical and
clinical corpus to date, with over 53.5 billion tokens, and addresses a key
limitation of prior clinical encoders by leveraging 20 datasets from diverse
institutions, domains, and geographic regions, rather than relying on data from
a single source. It outperforms existing biomedical and clinical encoders on
four downstream tasks spanning a broad range of use cases. We release both base
(150M parameters) and large (396M parameters) versions of BioClinical
ModernBERT, along with training checkpoints to support further research.

Result: 实验表明EFG框架与人工评估相关性更强，尤其在形式质量评估上表现优于粗粒度模型。

Conclusion: LLM作为评估工具，结合明确的原子属性，可为形式数学推理提供可扩展、可解释且可靠的评估支持。

Abstract: Autoformalization plays a crucial role in formal mathematical reasoning by
enabling the automatic translation of natural language statements into formal
languages. While recent advances using large language models (LLMs) have shown
promising results, methods for automatically evaluating autoformalization
remain underexplored. As one moves to more complex domains (e.g., advanced
mathematics), human evaluation requires significant time and domain expertise,
especially as the complexity of the underlying statements and background
knowledge increases. LLM-as-a-judge presents a promising approach for
automating such evaluation. However, existing methods typically employ
coarse-grained and generic evaluation criteria, which limit their effectiveness
for advanced formal mathematical reasoning, where quality hinges on nuanced,
multi-granular dimensions. In this work, we take a step toward addressing this
gap by introducing a systematic, automatic method to evaluate autoformalization
tasks. The proposed method is based on an epistemically and formally grounded
ensemble (EFG) of LLM judges, defined on criteria encompassing logical
preservation (LP), mathematical consistency (MC), formal validity (FV), and
formal quality (FQ), resulting in a transparent assessment that accounts for
different contributing factors. We validate the proposed framework to serve as
a proxy for autoformalization assessment within the domain of formal
mathematics. Overall, our experiments demonstrate that the EFG ensemble of LLM
judges is a suitable emerging proxy for evaluation, more strongly correlating
with human assessments than a coarse-grained model, especially when assessing
formal qualities. These findings suggest that LLM-as-judges, especially when
guided by a well-defined set of atomic properties, could offer a scalable,
interpretable, and reliable support for evaluating formal mathematical
reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如SAEs）在因果评估和可解释性方面存在不足，需要更直接的方法来分解模型的计算。

Method: 使用半非负矩阵分解（SNMF）直接分解MLP激活，生成稀疏线性组合的特征，并与输入关联以提高可解释性。

Result: SNMF在因果导向任务中表现优于SAEs和监督基线，且特征与人类可解释概念一致。

Conclusion: SNMF是一种简单有效的工具，可用于识别LLM中的可解释特征和概念表示。

Abstract: A central goal for mechanistic interpretability has been to identify the
right units of analysis in large language models (LLMs) that causally explain
their outputs. While early work focused on individual neurons, evidence that
neurons often encode multiple concepts has motivated a shift toward analyzing
directions in activation space. A key question is how to find directions that
capture interpretable features in an unsupervised manner. Current methods rely
on dictionary learning with sparse autoencoders (SAEs), commonly trained over
residual stream activations to learn directions from scratch. However, SAEs
often struggle in causal evaluations and lack intrinsic interpretability, as
their learning is not explicitly tied to the computations of the model. Here,
we tackle these limitations by directly decomposing MLP activations with
semi-nonnegative matrix factorization (SNMF), such that the learned features
are (a) sparse linear combinations of co-activated neurons, and (b) mapped to
their activating inputs, making them directly interpretable. Experiments on
Llama 3.1, Gemma 2 and GPT-2 show that SNMF derived features outperform SAEs
and a strong supervised baseline (difference-in-means) on causal steering,
while aligning with human-interpretable concepts. Further analysis reveals that
specific neuron combinations are reused across semantically-related features,
exposing a hierarchical structure in the MLP's activation space. Together,
these results position SNMF as a simple and effective tool for identifying
interpretable features and dissecting concept representations in LLMs.

Result: 模型能有效预测对话中的信念更新，并可通过更复杂的建模适应现实对话场景。

Conclusion: 动态认知摩擦模型为LLMs对齐提供了新视角，未来可进一步优化以适应复杂场景。

Abstract: Recent developments in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human
preferences have significantly enhanced their utility in human-AI collaborative
scenarios. However, such approaches often neglect the critical role of
"epistemic friction," or the inherent resistance encountered when updating
beliefs in response to new, conflicting, or ambiguous information. In this
paper, we define dynamic epistemic friction as the resistance to epistemic
integration, characterized by the misalignment between an agent's current
belief state and new propositions supported by external evidence. We position
this within the framework of Dynamic Epistemic Logic (Van Benthem and Pacuit,
2011), where friction emerges as nontrivial belief-revision during the
interaction. We then present analyses from a situated collaborative task that
demonstrate how this model of epistemic friction can effectively predict belief
updates in dialogues, and we subsequently discuss how the model of belief
alignment as a measure of epistemic resistance or friction can naturally be
made more sophisticated to accommodate the complexities of real-world dialogue
scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在语言模型预训练中数据混合的优化效率低且计算成本高，需要一种更高效的方法来识别最佳数据分布。

Method: Domain2Vec通过构建元域词汇表，将数据集分解为域向量（分布），并基于分布对齐假设（DA²）优化数据混合。

Result: 实验表明，Domain2Vec仅需51.5%的计算量即可达到相同验证损失，并在相同计算预算下平均提升下游任务性能2.83%。

Conclusion: Domain2Vec为语言模型预训练提供了一种高效、可扩展的数据混合优化方法。

Abstract: We introduce~\textsc{Domain2Vec}, a novel approach that decomposes any
dataset into a linear combination of several \emph{meta-domains}, a new concept
designed to capture the key underlying features of datasets.
\textsc{Domain2Vec} maintains a vocabulary of meta-domains and uses a
classifier to decompose any given dataset into a domain vector that corresponds
to a distribution over this vocabulary. These domain vectors enable the
identification of the optimal data mixture for language model (LM) pretraining
in a training-free manner under the \emph{\textbf{D}istribution
\textbf{A}lignment \textbf{A}ssumption} (DA$^{2}$), which suggests that when
the data distributions of the training set and the validation set are better
aligned, a lower validation loss is achieved. Moreover, \textsc{Domain2vec} can
be seamlessly integrated into previous works to model the relationship between
domain vectors and LM performance, greatly enhancing the efficiency and
scalability of previous methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
\textsc{Domain2Vec} helps find the data mixture that enhances downstream task
performance with minimal computational overhead. Specifically,
\textsc{Domain2Vec} achieves the same validation loss on Pile-CC using only
$51.5\%$ of the computation required when training on the original mixture of
The Pile dataset. Under equivalent compute budget, \textsc{Domain2Vec} improves
downstream performance by an average of $2.83\%$.

yields a knowledge rule base that provides explicit expert knowledge to assist
LLMs in Chinese harmful content detection. In addition, we propose a

Result: 模型能识别无用思维，但恢复能力差，大模型表现更糟，小模型对有害思维干扰更小。

Conclusion: 需改进模型的自我评估能力，以提升推理效果和系统安全性。

Abstract: Recent reasoning models show the ability to reflect, backtrack, and
self-validate their reasoning, which is crucial in spotting mistakes and
arriving at accurate solutions. A natural question that arises is how
effectively models can perform such self-reevaluation. We tackle this question
by investigating how well reasoning models identify and recover from four types
of unhelpful thoughts: uninformative rambling thoughts, thoughts irrelevant to
the question, thoughts misdirecting the question as a slightly different
question, and thoughts that lead to incorrect answers. We show that models are
effective at identifying most unhelpful thoughts but struggle to recover from
the same thoughts when these are injected into their thinking process, causing
significant performance drops. Models tend to naively continue the line of
reasoning of the injected irrelevant thoughts, which showcases that their
self-reevaluation abilities are far from a general "meta-cognitive" awareness.
Moreover, we observe non/inverse-scaling trends, where larger models struggle
more than smaller ones to recover from short irrelevant thoughts, even when
instructed to reevaluate their reasoning. We demonstrate the implications of
these findings with a jailbreak experiment using irrelevant thought injection,
showing that the smallest models are the least distracted by
harmful-response-triggering thoughts. Overall, our findings call for
improvement in self-reevaluation of reasoning models to develop better
reasoning and safer systems.

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在视频编辑性能上优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该方法为高效、灵活的视频编辑提供了新思路。

Abstract: Video editing using diffusion models has achieved remarkable results in
generating high-quality edits for videos. However, current methods often rely
on large-scale pretraining, limiting flexibility for specific edits.
First-frame-guided editing provides control over the first frame, but lacks
flexibility over subsequent frames. To address this, we propose a mask-based
LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) tuning method that adapts pretrained Image-to-Video
(I2V) models for flexible video editing. Our approach preserves background
regions while enabling controllable edits propagation. This solution offers
efficient and adaptable video editing without altering the model architecture.
To better steer this process, we incorporate additional references, such as
alternate viewpoints or representative scene states, which serve as visual
anchors for how content should unfold. We address the control challenge using a
mask-driven LoRA tuning strategy that adapts a pre-trained image-to-video model
to the editing context. The model must learn from two distinct sources: the
input video provides spatial structure and motion cues, while reference images
offer appearance guidance. A spatial mask enables region-specific learning by
dynamically modulating what the model attends to, ensuring that each area draws
from the appropriate source. Experimental results show our method achieves
superior video editing performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Conventional vision backbones, despite their success, often construct
features through a largely uniform cascade of operations, offering limited
explicit pathways for adaptive, iterative refinement. This raises a compelling
question: can principles from classical search algorithms instill a more
algorithmic, structured, and logical processing flow within these networks,
leading to representations built through more interpretable, perhaps
reasoning-like decision processes? We introduce DeepTraverse, a novel vision
architecture directly inspired by algorithmic search strategies, enabling it to
learn features through a process of systematic elucidation and adaptive
refinement distinct from conventional approaches. DeepTraverse operationalizes
this via two key synergistic components: recursive exploration modules that
methodically deepen feature analysis along promising representational paths
with parameter sharing for efficiency, and adaptive calibration modules that
dynamically adjust feature salience based on evolving global context. The
resulting algorithmic interplay allows DeepTraverse to intelligently construct
and refine feature patterns. Comprehensive evaluations across a diverse suite
of image classification benchmarks show that DeepTraverse achieves highly
competitive classification accuracy and robust feature discrimination, often
outperforming conventional models with similar or larger parameter counts. Our
work demonstrates that integrating such algorithmic priors provides a
principled and effective strategy for building more efficient, performant, and
structured vision backbones.

embodiments, outperforming the state-of-the-art in-context learning approach
using autoregressive vision-language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLA模型因计算和内存冗余严重限制了实际部署，而现有加速方法未能全面解决这些问题。

Method: 结合三种策略：语言模块冗余层剪枝、视觉处理路径优化、扩散动作头的中间特征缓存。

Result: 在CogACT模型上实现1.93倍加速，FLOPs降至28.9%，任务成功率仅下降0.6%。

Conclusion: EfficientVLA为VLA模型提供了一种高效且实用的加速方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, particularly diffusion-based
architectures, demonstrate transformative potential for embodied intelligence
but are severely hampered by high computational and memory demands stemming
from extensive inherent and inference-time redundancies. While existing
acceleration efforts often target isolated inefficiencies, such piecemeal
solutions typically fail to holistically address the varied computational and
memory bottlenecks across the entire VLA pipeline, thereby limiting practical
deployability. We introduce EfficientVLA, a structured and training-free
inference acceleration framework that systematically eliminates these barriers
by cohesively exploiting multifaceted redundancies. EfficientVLA
synergistically integrates three targeted strategies: (1) pruning of
functionally inconsequential layers from the language module, guided by an
analysis of inter-layer redundancies; (2) optimizing the visual processing
pathway through a task-aware strategy that selects a compact, diverse set of
visual tokens, balancing task-criticality with informational coverage; and (3)
alleviating temporal computational redundancy within the iterative
diffusion-based action head by strategically caching and reusing key
intermediate features. We apply our method to a standard VLA model CogACT,
yielding a 1.93X inference speedup and reduces FLOPs to 28.9%, with only a 0.6%
success rate drop in the SIMPLER benchmark.

Conclusion: ICCWD的发布有望帮助设计更优的未成年人检测方法。

Abstract: Platforms and the law regulate digital content depicting minors (defined as
individuals under 18 years of age) differently from other types of content.
Given the sheer amount of content that needs to be assessed, machine
learning-based automation tools are commonly used to detect content depicting
minors. To our knowledge, no dataset or benchmark currently exists for
detecting these identification methods in a multi-modal environment. To fill
this gap, we release the Image-Caption Children in the Wild Dataset (ICCWD), an
image-caption dataset aimed at benchmarking tools that detect depictions of
minors. Our dataset is richer than previous child image datasets, containing
images of children in a variety of contexts, including fictional depictions and
partially visible bodies. ICCWD contains 10,000 image-caption pairs manually
labeled to indicate the presence or absence of a child in the image. To
demonstrate the possible utility of our dataset, we use it to benchmark three
different detectors, including a commercial age estimation system applied to
images. Our results suggest that child detection is a challenging task, with
the best method achieving a 75.3% true positive rate. We hope the release of
our dataset will aid in the design of better minor detection methods in a wide
range of scenarios.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great effectiveness for fine-tuning
large language models (LLMs) using tasks that are challenging yet easily
verifiable, such as math reasoning or code generation. However, extending this
success to visual perception in vision-language models (VLMs) has been impeded
by the scarcity of vision-centric tasks that are simultaneously challenging and
unambiguously verifiable. To this end, we introduce ViCrit (Visual Caption
Hallucination Critic), an RL proxy task that trains VLMs to localize a subtle,
synthetic visual hallucination injected into paragraphs of human-written image
captions. Starting from a 200-word captions, we inject a single, subtle visual
description error-altering a few words on objects, attributes, counts, or
spatial relations-and task the model to pinpoint the corrupted span given the
image and the modified caption. This formulation preserves the full perceptual
difficulty while providing a binary, exact-match reward that is easy to compute
and unambiguous. Models trained with the ViCrit Task exhibit substantial gains
across a variety of VL benchmarks. Crucially, the improvements transfer beyond
natural-image training data to abstract image reasoning and visual math,
showing promises of learning to perceive rather than barely memorizing seen
objects. To facilitate evaluation, we further introduce ViCrit-Bench, a
category-balanced diagnostic benchmark that systematically probes perception
errors across diverse image domains and error types. Together, our results
demonstrate that fine-grained hallucination criticism is an effective and
generalizable objective for enhancing visual perception in VLMs.

Conclusion: RoCA在跨域场景中表现出色，为端到端自动驾驶的跨域部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving has recently emerged as a new paradigm,
offering significant potential. However, few studies have looked into the
practical challenge of deployment across domains (e.g., cities). Although
several works have incorporated Large Language Models (LLMs) to leverage their
open-world knowledge, LLMs do not guarantee cross-domain driving performance
and may incur prohibitive retraining costs during domain adaptation. In this
paper, we propose RoCA, a novel framework for robust cross-domain E2E
autonomous driving. RoCA formulates the joint probabilistic distribution over
the tokens that encode ego and surrounding vehicle information in the E2E
pipeline. Instantiating with a Gaussian process (GP), RoCA learns a set of
basis tokens with corresponding trajectories, which span diverse driving
scenarios. Then, given any driving scene, it is able to probabilistically infer
the future trajectory. By using RoCA together with a base E2E model in
source-domain training, we improve the generalizability of the base model,
without requiring extra inference computation. In addition, RoCA enables robust
adaptation on new target domains, significantly outperforming direct
finetuning. We extensively evaluate RoCA on various cross-domain scenarios and
show that it achieves strong domain generalization and adaptation performance.

Result: 实验表明，SPARKE在提升多样性的同时，未显著增加计算成本。

Conclusion: SPARKE是一种高效且可扩展的提示感知多样性引导方法。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in high-fidelity image
synthesis and prompt-guided generative modeling. However, ensuring adequate
diversity in generated samples of prompt-guided diffusion models remains a
challenge, particularly when the prompts span a broad semantic spectrum and the
diversity of generated data needs to be evaluated in a prompt-aware fashion
across semantically similar prompts. Recent methods have introduced guidance
via diversity measures to encourage more varied generations. In this work, we
extend the diversity measure-based approaches by proposing the Scalable
Prompt-Aware R\'eny Kernel Entropy Diversity Guidance (SPARKE) method for
prompt-aware diversity guidance. SPARKE utilizes conditional entropy for
diversity guidance, which dynamically conditions diversity measurement on
similar prompts and enables prompt-aware diversity control. While the
entropy-based guidance approach enhances prompt-aware diversity, its reliance
on the matrix-based entropy scores poses computational challenges in
large-scale generation settings. To address this, we focus on the special case
of Conditional latent RKE Score Guidance, reducing entropy computation and
gradient-based optimization complexity from the $O(n^3)$ of general entropy
measures to $O(n)$. The reduced computational complexity allows for
diversity-guided sampling over potentially thousands of generation rounds on
different prompts. We numerically test the SPARKE method on several
text-to-image diffusion models, demonstrating that the proposed method improves
the prompt-aware diversity of the generated data without incurring significant
computational costs. We release our code on the project page:

Conclusion: 该方法能够隐式学习地表反射率动态，提升复杂地形下的泛化能力，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Accurate retrieval of surface solar radiation (SSR) from satellite imagery
critically depends on estimating the background reflectance that a spaceborne
sensor would observe under clear-sky conditions. Deviations from this baseline
can then be used to detect cloud presence and guide radiative transfer models
in inferring atmospheric attenuation. Operational retrieval algorithms
typically approximate background reflectance using monthly statistics, assuming
surface properties vary slowly relative to atmospheric conditions. However,
this approach fails in mountainous regions where intermittent snow cover and
changing snow surfaces are frequent. We propose an attention-based emulator for
SSR retrieval that implicitly learns to infer clear-sky surface reflectance
from raw satellite image sequences. Built on the Temporo-Spatial Vision
Transformer, our approach eliminates the need for hand-crafted features such as
explicit albedo maps or cloud masks. The emulator is trained on instantaneous
SSR estimates from the HelioMont algorithm over Switzerland, a region
characterized by complex terrain and dynamic snow cover. Inputs include
multi-spectral SEVIRI imagery from the Meteosat Second Generation platform,
augmented with static topographic features and solar geometry. The target
variable is HelioMont's SSR, computed as the sum of its direct and diffuse
horizontal irradiance components, given at a spatial resolution of 1.7 km. We
show that, when provided a sufficiently long temporal context, the model
matches the performances of albedo-informed models, highlighting the model's
ability to internally learn and exploit latent surface reflectance dynamics.
Our geospatial analysis shows this effect is most powerful in mountainous
regions and improves generalization in both simple and complex topographic
settings. Code and datasets are publicly available at

Motivation: 由于线性探测（LP）无法充分评估掩码图像建模（MIM）模型的潜力，且现有注意力探测方法存在参数冗余和计算效率低的问题，作者提出了一种更高效的探测方法。

Method: 引入高效探测（EP），采用多查询交叉注意力机制，减少冗余投影和可训练参数，提升计算效率。

Result: EP在七个基准测试中优于LP和现有注意力探测方法，计算速度提升10倍，并在低样本和分层设置中表现优异。

Conclusion: EP是一种高效、通用且可解释的探测方法，适用于多种预训练范式。

Abstract: As fine-tuning (FT) becomes increasingly impractical at scale, probing is
emerging as the preferred evaluation protocol for self-supervised learning
(SSL). Yet, the standard linear probing (LP) fails to adequately reflect the
potential of models trained with Masked Image Modeling (MIM), due to the
distributed nature of patch tokens. This motivates the need for attentive
probing, an alternative that uses attention to selectively aggregate
patch-level features. Despite its growing adoption, attentive probing remains
under-explored, with existing methods suffering from excessive parameterization
and poor computational efficiency.
  In this work, we revisit attentive probing through the lens of the
accuracy-efficiency trade-off. We conduct a systematic study of existing
methods, analyzing their mechanisms and benchmarking their performance. We
introduce efficient probing (EP), a multi-query cross-attention mechanism that
eliminates redundant projections, reduces the number of trainable parameters,
and achieves up to a 10$\times$ speed-up over conventional multi-head
attention. Despite its simplicity, EP outperforms LP and prior attentive
probing approaches across seven benchmarks, generalizes well beyond MIM to
diverse pre-training paradigms, produces interpretable attention maps, and
achieves strong gains in low-shot and layer-wise settings. Code available at

Result: 在DeepFashion2和ConCon-Chi基准测试中，个性化检索准确率比现有方法提升4%-22%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过低秩适应和参数加法，有效平衡个人化与通用知识，显著提升检索性能。

Abstract: Personalized vision-language retrieval seeks to recognize new concepts (e.g.
"my dog Fido") from only a few examples. This task is challenging because it
requires not only learning a new concept from a few images, but also
integrating the personal and general knowledge together to recognize the
concept in different contexts. In this paper, we show how to effectively adapt
the internal representation of a vision-language dual encoder model for
personalized vision-language retrieval. We find that regularized low-rank
adaption of a small set of parameters in the language encoder's final layer
serves as a highly effective alternative to textual inversion for recognizing
the personal concept while preserving general knowledge. Additionally, we
explore strategies for combining parameters of multiple learned personal
concepts, finding that parameter addition is effective. To evaluate how well
general knowledge is preserved in a finetuned representation, we introduce a
metric that measures image retrieval accuracy based on captions generated by a
vision language model (VLM). Our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on
two benchmarks for personalized image retrieval with natural language queries -
DeepFashion2 and ConCon-Chi - outperforming the prior art by 4%-22% on personal
retrievals.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose ScoreMix, a novel yet simple data augmentation
strategy leveraging the score compositional properties of diffusion models to
enhance discriminator performance, particularly under scenarios with limited
labeled data. By convexly mixing the scores from different class-conditioned
trajectories during diffusion sampling, we generate challenging synthetic
samples that significantly improve discriminative capabilities in all studied
benchmarks. We systematically investigate class-selection strategies for mixing
and discover that greater performance gains arise when combining classes
distant in the discriminator's embedding space, rather than close in the
generator's condition space. Moreover, we empirically show that, under standard
metrics, the correlation between the generator's learned condition space and
the discriminator's embedding space is minimal. Our approach achieves notable
performance improvements without extensive parameter searches, demonstrating
practical advantages for training discriminative models while effectively
mitigating problems regarding collections of large datasets. Paper website:

Result: 在AIST++数据集和人类评估中，DanceChat在质量和多样性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DanceChat通过LLM的显式指导，解决了音乐到舞蹈生成中的多样性和对齐问题。

Abstract: Music-to-dance generation aims to synthesize human dance motion conditioned
on musical input. Despite recent progress, significant challenges remain due to
the semantic gap between music and dance motion, as music offers only abstract
cues, such as melody, groove, and emotion, without explicitly specifying the
physical movements. Moreover, a single piece of music can produce multiple
plausible dance interpretations. This one-to-many mapping demands additional
guidance, as music alone provides limited information for generating diverse
dance movements. The challenge is further amplified by the scarcity of paired
music and dance data, which restricts the model\^a\u{A}\'Zs ability to learn
diverse dance patterns. In this paper, we introduce DanceChat, a Large Language
Model (LLM)-guided music-to-dance generation approach. We use an LLM as a
choreographer that provides textual motion instructions, offering explicit,
high-level guidance for dance generation. This approach goes beyond implicit
learning from music alone, enabling the model to generate dance that is both
more diverse and better aligned with musical styles. Our approach consists of
three components: (1) an LLM-based pseudo instruction generation module that
produces textual dance guidance based on music style and structure, (2) a
multi-modal feature extraction and fusion module that integrates music, rhythm,
and textual guidance into a shared representation, and (3) a diffusion-based
motion synthesis module together with a multi-modal alignment loss, which
ensures that the generated dance is aligned with both musical and textual cues.
Extensive experiments on AIST++ and human evaluations show that DanceChat
outperforms state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Abstract: California is a global leader in agricultural production, contributing 12.5%
of the United States total output and ranking as the fifth-largest food and
cotton supplier in the world. Despite the availability of extensive historical
yield data from the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service, accurate and
timely crop yield forecasting remains a challenge due to the complex interplay
of environmental, climatic, and soil-related factors. In this study, we
introduce a comprehensive crop yield benchmark dataset covering over 70 crops
across all California counties from 2008 to 2022. The benchmark integrates
diverse data sources, including Landsat satellite imagery, daily climate
records, monthly evapotranspiration, and high-resolution soil properties. To
effectively learn from these heterogeneous inputs, we develop a multi-modal
deep learning model tailored for county-level, crop-specific yield forecasting.
The model employs stratified feature extraction and a timeseries encoder to
capture spatial and temporal dynamics during the growing season. Static inputs
such as soil characteristics and crop identity inform long-term variability.
Our approach achieves an overall R2 score of 0.76 across all crops of unseen
test dataset, highlighting strong predictive performance across California
diverse agricultural regions. This benchmark and modeling framework offer a
valuable foundation for advancing agricultural forecasting, climate adaptation,
and precision farming. The full dataset and codebase are publicly available at

Conclusion: DySS在性能和效率上均优于现有方法，适用于自动驾驶感知任务。

Abstract: Camera-based 3D object detection in Bird's Eye View (BEV) is one of the most
important perception tasks in autonomous driving. Earlier methods rely on dense
BEV features, which are costly to construct. More recent works explore sparse
query-based detection. However, they still require a large number of queries
and can become expensive to run when more video frames are used. In this paper,
we propose DySS, a novel method that employs state-space learning and dynamic
queries. More specifically, DySS leverages a state-space model (SSM) to
sequentially process the sampled features over time steps. In order to
encourage the model to better capture the underlying motion and correspondence
information, we introduce auxiliary tasks of future prediction and masked
reconstruction to better train the SSM. The state of the SSM then provides an
informative yet efficient summarization of the scene. Based on the state-space
learned features, we dynamically update the queries via merge, remove, and
split operations, which help maintain a useful, lean set of detection queries
throughout the network. Our proposed DySS achieves both superior detection
performance and efficient inference. Specifically, on the nuScenes test split,
DySS achieves 65.31 NDS and 57.4 mAP, outperforming the latest state of the
art. On the val split, DySS achieves 56.2 NDS and 46.2 mAP, as well as a

TL;DR: CIDer是一个新型的多模态情感识别框架，通过自蒸馏和因果推理模块解决模态缺失和分布外数据问题，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态情感识别（MER）面临模态缺失和分布外数据（OOD）的双重挑战，现有方法实用性受限。

Method: 提出CIDer框架，包含自蒸馏模块（MSSD）和因果推理模块（MACI），并引入RMFM任务。

Result: CIDer在RMFM和OOD场景下表现稳健，参数更少且训练更快。

Conclusion: CIDer通过创新设计解决了MER中的关键问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) face challenges
in addressing both modality missing and Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data
simultaneously. Existing methods often rely on specific models or introduce
excessive parameters, which limits their practicality. To address these issues,
we propose a novel robust MER framework, Causal Inference Distiller (CIDer),
and introduce a new task, Random Modality Feature Missing (RMFM), to generalize
the definition of modality missing. CIDer integrates two key components: a
Model-Specific Self-Distillation (MSSD) module and a Model-Agnostic Causal
Inference (MACI) module. MSSD enhances robustness under the RMFM task through a
weight-sharing self-distillation approach applied across low-level features,
attention maps, and high-level representations. Additionally, a Word-level
Self-aligned Attention Module (WSAM) reduces computational complexity, while a
Multimodal Composite Transformer (MCT) facilitates efficient multimodal fusion.
To tackle OOD challenges, MACI employs a tailored causal graph to mitigate
label and language biases using a Multimodal Causal Module (MCM) and
fine-grained counterfactual texts. Notably, MACI can independently enhance OOD
generalization with minimal additional parameters. Furthermore, we also
introduce the new repartitioned MER OOD datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that CIDer achieves robust performance in both RMFM and OOD
scenarios, with fewer parameters and faster training compared to
state-of-the-art methods. The implementation of this work is publicly
accessible at https://github.com/gw-zhong/CIDer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有幻觉检测方法计算成本高、结果绝对化的问题，提升视觉语言模型的可靠性。

Method: 构建HalLoc数据集，包含多种任务的标注样本；开发低开销基线模型，支持实时检测。

Result: HalLoc数据集和基线模型公开可用，支持概率性检测，提升模型可靠性。

Conclusion: HalLoc为视觉语言模型的幻觉检测提供了高效解决方案，增强了实际应用的信任度。

Abstract: Hallucinations pose a significant challenge to the reliability of large
vision-language models, making their detection essential for ensuring accuracy
in critical applications. Current detection methods often rely on
computationally intensive models, leading to high latency and resource demands.
Their definitive outcomes also fail to account for real-world scenarios where
the line between hallucinated and truthful information is unclear. To address
these issues, we propose HalLoc, a dataset designed for efficient,
probabilistic hallucination detection. It features 150K token-level annotated
samples, including hallucination types, across Visual Question Answering (VQA),
instruction-following, and image captioning tasks. This dataset facilitates the
development of models that detect hallucinations with graded confidence,
enabling more informed user interactions. Additionally, we introduce a baseline
model trained on HalLoc, offering low-overhead, concurrent hallucination
detection during generation. The model can be seamlessly integrated into
existing VLMs, improving reliability while preserving efficiency. The prospect
of a robust plug-and-play hallucination detection module opens new avenues for
enhancing the trustworthiness of vision-language models in real-world
applications. The HalLoc dataset and code are publicly available at:

TL;DR: 该研究通过迁移学习和不确定性量化（UQ）评估了深度学习模型在皮肤癌分类中的表现，发现CLIP-based视觉变换器结合SVM性能最佳，且集成方法在准确性和不确定性处理间取得平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 皮肤癌的准确诊断对早期治疗至关重要，但现有深度学习模型受限于数据稀缺和缺乏不确定性意识。

Method: 使用迁移学习（多种预训练特征提取器和分类器）和不确定性量化（MCD、集成、EMCD）在HAM10000数据集上进行评估。

Result: CLIP-based视觉变换器（如LAION CLIP ViT-H/14）结合SVM表现最佳；集成方法在准确性和不确定性处理间表现良好，EMCD对不确定预测更敏感。

Conclusion: 将UQ整合到基于深度学习的医学诊断中，可提升性能和临床应用的可靠性。

Abstract: Accurate and reliable skin cancer diagnosis is critical for early treatment
and improved patient outcomes. Deep learning (DL) models have shown promise in
automating skin cancer classification, but their performance can be limited by
data scarcity and a lack of uncertainty awareness. In this study, we present a
comprehensive evaluation of DL-based skin lesion classification using transfer
learning and uncertainty quantification (UQ) on the HAM10000 dataset. In the
first phase, we benchmarked several pre-trained feature extractors-including
Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) variants, Residual Network-50
(ResNet50), Densely Connected Convolutional Network (DenseNet121), Visual
Geometry Group network (VGG16), and EfficientNet-V2-Large-combined with a range
of traditional classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), eXtreme
Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and logistic regression. Our results show that
CLIP-based vision transformers, particularly LAION CLIP ViT-H/14 with SVM,
deliver the highest classification performance. In the second phase, we
incorporated UQ using Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD), Ensemble, and Ensemble Monte
Carlo Dropout (EMCD) to assess not only prediction accuracy but also the
reliability of model outputs. We evaluated these models using uncertainty-aware
metrics such as uncertainty accuracy(UAcc), uncertainty sensitivity(USen),
uncertainty specificity(USpe), and uncertainty precision(UPre). The results
demonstrate that ensemble methods offer a good trade-off between accuracy and
uncertainty handling, while EMCD is more sensitive to uncertain predictions.
This study highlights the importance of integrating UQ into DL-based medical
diagnosis to enhance both performance and trustworthiness in real-world
clinical applications.

Motivation: 现有评估方法忽视了时间推理和程序有效性，VRBench填补了这一空白。

Method: 采用多阶段过滤和专家评审筛选视频，开发人机协作框架生成多步推理链，设计多阶段评估流程。

Result: 评估了12个LLM和16个VLM，提供了多步推理领域的深入分析。

Conclusion: VRBench为多步推理领域提供了重要基准和见解。

Abstract: We present VRBench, the first long narrative video benchmark crafted for
evaluating large models' multi-step reasoning capabilities, addressing
limitations in existing evaluations that overlook temporal reasoning and
procedural validity. It comprises 1,010 long videos (with an average duration
of 1.6 hours), along with 9,468 human-labeled multi-step question-answering
pairs and 30,292 reasoning steps with timestamps. These videos are curated via
a multi-stage filtering process including expert inter-rater reviewing to
prioritize plot coherence. We develop a human-AI collaborative framework that
generates coherent reasoning chains, each requiring multiple temporally
grounded steps, spanning seven types (e.g., event attribution, implicit
inference). VRBench designs a multi-phase evaluation pipeline that assesses
models at both the outcome and process levels. Apart from the MCQs for the
final results, we propose a progress-level LLM-guided scoring metric to
evaluate the quality of the reasoning chain from multiple dimensions
comprehensively. Through extensive evaluations of 12 LLMs and 16 VLMs on
VRBench, we undertake a thorough analysis and provide valuable insights that
advance the field of multi-step reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 皮肤癌是全球最常见的癌症，手动生成SOAP笔记耗时且导致临床医生疲劳，需要一种自动化解决方案。

Method: 采用弱监督多模态框架，结合病变图像和稀疏临床文本生成SOAP笔记，减少对人工标注的依赖。

Result: 性能与GPT-4o、Claude和DeepSeek Janus Pro相当，并引入了MedConceptEval和CCS两个新指标评估临床质量。

Conclusion: 该方法可扩展且临床实用，减轻了临床医生负担，同时减少了对大规模标注数据的需求。

Abstract: Skin carcinoma is the most prevalent form of cancer globally, accounting for
over $8 billion in annual healthcare expenditures. In clinical settings,
physicians document patient visits using detailed SOAP (Subjective, Objective,
Assessment, and Plan) notes. However, manually generating these notes is
labor-intensive and contributes to clinician burnout. In this work, we propose
a weakly supervised multimodal framework to generate clinically structured SOAP
notes from limited inputs, including lesion images and sparse clinical text.
Our approach reduces reliance on manual annotations, enabling scalable,
clinically grounded documentation while alleviating clinician burden and
reducing the need for large annotated data. Our method achieves performance
comparable to GPT-4o, Claude, and DeepSeek Janus Pro across key clinical
relevance metrics. To evaluate clinical quality, we introduce two novel metrics
MedConceptEval and Clinical Coherence Score (CCS) which assess semantic
alignment with expert medical concepts and input features, respectively.

Motivation: 随着元宇宙的兴起，全向视频（ODV）逐渐从专业生成内容（PGC）转向用户生成内容（UGC），但音视频质量评估（AVQA）的研究仍有限。

Method: 构建了一个包含300个视频的UGC ODV数据集，并进行了主观AVQA实验。随后设计了一个包含视频特征提取、音频特征提取和音视频融合模块的基线模型。

Result: 实验结果表明，基线模型在提出的数据集上表现最优。

Conclusion: 该研究为UGC-ODV AVQA领域的发展提供了数据集和有效的基线模型。

Abstract: In response to the rising prominence of the Metaverse, omnidirectional videos
(ODVs) have garnered notable interest, gradually shifting from
professional-generated content (PGC) to user-generated content (UGC). However,
the study of audio-visual quality assessment (AVQA) within ODVs remains
limited. To address this, we construct a dataset of UGC omnidirectional audio
and video (A/V) content. The videos are captured by five individuals using two
different types of omnidirectional cameras, shooting 300 videos covering 10
different scene types. A subjective AVQA experiment is conducted on the dataset
to obtain the Mean Opinion Scores (MOSs) of the A/V sequences. After that, to
facilitate the development of UGC-ODV AVQA fields, we construct an effective
AVQA baseline model on the proposed dataset, of which the baseline model
consists of video feature extraction module, audio feature extraction and
audio-visual fusion module. The experimental results demonstrate that our model
achieves optimal performance on the proposed dataset.

Motivation: 探索是否可以通过视频直接学习上下文图像编辑模型，避免依赖特定任务流水线和专家模型。

Method: 提出了一种可扩展的视频标注方法，设计了一个块因果扩散变换器，训练于三个代理任务：下一图像预测、当前分割预测和下一分割预测。

Result: 模型在多轮图像编辑基准测试中表现优异，并展示了多概念组合、故事生成和编辑链应用的能力。

Conclusion: 研究表明，直接从视频学习上下文图像编辑是可行的，且模型在多种任务中表现出色。

Abstract: In-context image editing aims to modify images based on a contextual sequence
comprising text and previously generated images. Existing methods typically
depend on task-specific pipelines and expert models (e.g., segmentation and
inpainting) to curate training data. In this work, we explore whether an
in-context image editing model can be learned directly from videos. We
introduce a scalable approach to annotate videos as interleaved multimodal
sequences. To effectively learn from this data, we design a block-causal
diffusion transformer trained on three proxy tasks: next-image prediction,
current segmentation prediction, and next-segmentation prediction.
Additionally, we propose a novel multi-turn image editing benchmark to advance
research in this area. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model
exhibits strong in-context image editing capabilities and achieves
state-of-the-art results on two multi-turn image editing benchmarks. Despite
being trained exclusively on videos, our model also shows promising abilities
in multi-concept composition, story generation, and chain-of-editing
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督学习方法在跨场景泛化能力上存在不足，而VLMs提供了一种无需微调即可泛化的新途径。

Method: 使用两种VLMs（Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct和Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct）对5000张学生面部表情图像进行零样本分析。

Result: Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct在识别困惑和快乐情绪上表现更优，但两种模型均无法检测分心行为。

Conclusion: VLMs在学术情绪分析中具有潜力，尤其是Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct在识别困惑情绪上表现突出，但需进一步改进以检测分心行为。

Abstract: Students' academic emotions significantly influence their social behavior and
learning performance. Traditional approaches to automatically and accurately
analyze these emotions have predominantly relied on supervised machine learning
algorithms. However, these models often struggle to generalize across different
contexts, necessitating repeated cycles of data collection, annotation, and
training. The emergence of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offers a promising
alternative, enabling generalization across visual recognition tasks through
zero-shot prompting without requiring fine-tuning. This study investigates the
potential of VLMs to analyze students' academic emotions via facial expressions
in an online learning environment. We employed two VLMs,
Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct and Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, to analyze 5,000
images depicting confused, distracted, happy, neutral, and tired expressions
using zero-shot prompting. Preliminary results indicate that both models
demonstrate moderate performance in academic facial expression recognition,
with Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct outperforming Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct.
Notably, both models excel in identifying students' happy emotions but fail to
detect distracted behavior. Additionally, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct exhibits
relatively high performance in recognizing students' confused expressions,
highlighting its potential for practical applications in identifying content
that causes student confusion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D高斯泼溅方法需要大量校准视图，稀疏输入时易过拟合，导致渲染质量下降。

Method: 利用立体基础模型估计相机位姿并重建密集点云；通过多尺度2D外观特征采样和自注意力机制的点交互网络增强点表示；使用轻量级MLP解码高斯参数。

Result: 在多样化基准测试中显著优于NeRF方法，在少样本设置下与最先进的3DGS方法竞争。

Conclusion: 该方法在稀疏视图输入下实现了高质量的实时渲染，解决了3DGS的过拟合问题。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) is an innovative rendering technique that
surpasses the neural radiance field (NeRF) in both rendering speed and visual
quality by leveraging an explicit 3D scene representation. Existing 3DGS
approaches require a large number of calibrated views to generate a consistent
and complete scene representation. When input views are limited, 3DGS tends to
overfit the training views, leading to noticeable degradation in rendering
quality. To address this limitation, we propose a Point-wise Feature-Aware
Gaussian Splatting framework that enables real-time, high-quality rendering
from sparse training views. Specifically, we first employ the latest stereo
foundation model to estimate accurate camera poses and reconstruct a dense
point cloud for Gaussian initialization. We then encode the colour attributes
of each 3D Gaussian by sampling and aggregating multiscale 2D appearance
features from sparse inputs. To enhance point-wise appearance representation,
we design a point interaction network based on a self-attention mechanism,
allowing each Gaussian point to interact with its nearest neighbors. These
enriched features are subsequently decoded into Gaussian parameters through two
lightweight multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) for final rendering. Extensive
experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms NeRF-based approaches and achieves competitive performance under
few-shot settings compared to the state-of-the-art 3DGS methods.

Result: 实验证明GeoCAD在生成质量、有效性和文本-CAD一致性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: GeoCAD成功实现了局部几何可控的CAD生成，代码将开源。

Abstract: Local geometry-controllable computer-aided design (CAD) generation aims to
modify local parts of CAD models automatically, enhancing design efficiency. It
also ensures that the shapes of newly generated local parts follow
user-specific geometric instructions (e.g., an isosceles right triangle or a
rectangle with one corner cut off). However, existing methods encounter
challenges in achieving this goal. Specifically, they either lack the ability
to follow textual instructions or are unable to focus on the local parts. To
address this limitation, we introduce GeoCAD, a user-friendly and local
geometry-controllable CAD generation method. Specifically, we first propose a
complementary captioning strategy to generate geometric instructions for local
parts. This strategy involves vertex-based and VLLM-based captioning for
systematically annotating simple and complex parts, respectively. In this way,
we caption $\sim$221k different local parts in total. In the training stage,
given a CAD model, we randomly mask a local part. Then, using its geometric
instruction and the remaining parts as input, we prompt large language models
(LLMs) to predict the masked part. During inference, users can specify any
local part for modification while adhering to a variety of predefined geometric
instructions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of GeoCAD in
generation quality, validity and text-to-CAD consistency. Code will be
available at https://github.com/Zhanwei-Z/GeoCAD.

Motivation: 由于地理、历史和社会政治因素的差异，城市文化和建筑风格存在显著差异。传统研究方法依赖专家解读和历史文献，难以标准化。

Method: 构建了UrbanDiffBench数据集，并开发了基于视觉语言模型的框架UrbanSense，用于定量生成和比较城市风格表示。

Result: 实验结果显示，超过80%的生成描述通过t检验（p<0.05），主观评价的高Phi分数（城市0.912，时期0.833）证实了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够量化并解释城市风格的演变，为未来设计提供了科学依据。

Abstract: Urban cultures and architectural styles vary significantly across cities due
to geographical, chronological, historical, and socio-political factors.
Understanding these differences is essential for anticipating how cities may
evolve in the future. As representative cases of historical continuity and
modern innovation in China, Beijing and Shenzhen offer valuable perspectives
for exploring the transformation of urban streetscapes. However, conventional
approaches to urban cultural studies often rely on expert interpretation and
historical documentation, which are difficult to standardize across different
contexts. To address this, we propose a multimodal research framework based on
vision-language models, enabling automated and scalable analysis of urban
streetscape style differences. This approach enhances the objectivity and
data-driven nature of urban form research. The contributions of this study are
as follows: First, we construct UrbanDiffBench, a curated dataset of urban
streetscapes containing architectural images from different periods and
regions. Second, we develop UrbanSense, the first vision-language-model-based
framework for urban streetscape analysis, enabling the quantitative generation
and comparison of urban style representations. Third, experimental results show
that Over 80% of generated descriptions pass the t-test (p less than 0.05).
High Phi scores (0.912 for cities, 0.833 for periods) from subjective
evaluations confirm the method's ability to capture subtle stylistic
differences. These results highlight the method's potential to quantify and
interpret urban style evolution, offering a scientifically grounded lens for
future design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中医学图像分辨率差异大，传统配准方法需固定分辨率重采样，导致伪影。

Method: RKM 扩展了 KeyMorph 框架，通过输出真实世界坐标的关键点，避免重采样。

Result: 实验证明 RKM 在腹部 MRI 和脑部数据集的配准任务中表现优越。

Conclusion: RKM 提供了一种更优的医学图像配准解决方案。

Abstract: Many real-world settings require registration of a pair of medical images
that differ in spatial resolution, which may arise from differences in image
acquisition parameters like pixel spacing, slice thickness, and field-of-view.
However, all previous machine learning-based registration techniques resample
images onto a fixed resolution. This is suboptimal because resampling can
introduce artifacts due to interpolation. To address this, we present
RealKeyMorph (RKM), a resolution-agnostic method for image registration. RKM is
an extension of KeyMorph, a registration framework which works by training a
network to learn corresponding keypoints for a given pair of images, after
which a closed-form keypoint matching step is used to derive the transformation
that aligns them. To avoid resampling and enable operating on the raw data, RKM
outputs keypoints in real-world coordinates of the scanner. To do this, we
leverage the affine matrix produced by the scanner (e.g., MRI machine) that
encodes the mapping from voxel coordinates to real world coordinates. By
transforming keypoints into real-world space and integrating this into the
training process, RKM effectively enables the extracted keypoints to be
resolution-agnostic. In our experiments, we demonstrate the advantages of RKM
on the registration task for orthogonal 2D stacks of abdominal MRIs, as well as
3D volumes with varying resolutions in brain datasets.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖端到端映射，难以捕捉深层语言结构和逻辑推理，导致生成动作缺乏可控性和一致性。

Method: 采用Chain-of-Thought机制分解指令，结合Group Relative Policy Optimization强化学习算法联合优化推理链和动作生成。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上表现优于现有方法，尤其在复杂语义理解和长期时间一致性场景中。

Conclusion: Motion-R1通过结构化推理显著提升了文本到动作生成的质量和多样性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models, especially in natural language
understanding and reasoning, have opened new possibilities for text-to-motion
generation. Although existing approaches have made notable progress in semantic
alignment and motion synthesis, they often rely on end-to-end mapping
strategies that fail to capture deep linguistic structures and logical
reasoning. Consequently, generated motions tend to lack controllability,
consistency, and diversity. To address these limitations, we propose Motion-R1,
a unified motion-language modeling framework that integrates a Chain-of-Thought
mechanism. By explicitly decomposing complex textual instructions into
logically structured action paths, Motion-R1 provides high-level semantic
guidance for motion generation, significantly enhancing the model's ability to
interpret and execute multi-step, long-horizon, and compositionally rich
commands. To train our model, we adopt Group Relative Policy Optimization, a
reinforcement learning algorithm designed for large models, which leverages
motion quality feedback to optimize reasoning chains and motion synthesis
jointly. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate
that Motion-R1 achieves competitive or superior performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods, particularly in scenarios requiring nuanced semantic
understanding and long-term temporal coherence. The code, model and data will
be publicly available.

performance compared to state-of-the-art lightweight models. MHLA notably
improves inference speed, allowing FaceLiVT to deliver high accuracy with lower

Abstract: The infrared and visible images fusion (IVIF) is receiving increasing
attention from both the research community and industry due to its excellent
results in downstream applications. Existing deep learning approaches often
utilize convolutional neural networks to extract image features. However, the
inherently capacity of convolution operations to capture global context can
lead to information loss, thereby restricting fusion performance. To address
this limitation, we propose an end-to-end fusion network named the
Frequency-Spatial Attention Transformer Fusion Network (FSATFusion). The
FSATFusion contains a frequency-spatial attention Transformer (FSAT) module
designed to effectively capture discriminate features from source images. This
FSAT module includes a frequency-spatial attention mechanism (FSAM) capable of
extracting significant features from feature maps. Additionally, we propose an
improved Transformer module (ITM) to enhance the ability to extract global
context information of vanilla Transformer. We conducted both qualitative and
quantitative comparative experiments, demonstrating the superior fusion quality
and efficiency of FSATFusion compared to other state-of-the-art methods.
Furthermore, our network was tested on two additional tasks without any
modifications, to verify the excellent generalization capability of FSATFusion.
Finally, the object detection experiment demonstrated the superiority of
FSATFusion in downstream visual tasks. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 研究为自注意力机制提供了更深入的理论解释，同时通过改进架构提升了实际性能。

Abstract: The self-attention mechanism, a cornerstone of Transformer-based
state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, is largely heuristic-driven and
fundamentally challenging to interpret. Establishing a robust theoretical
foundation to explain its remarkable success and limitations has therefore
become an increasingly prominent focus in recent research. Some notable
directions have explored understanding self-attention through the lens of image
denoising and nonparametric regression. While promising, existing frameworks
still lack a deeper mechanistic interpretation of various architectural
components that enhance self-attention, both in its original formulation and
subsequent variants. In this work, we aim to advance this understanding by
developing a unifying image processing framework, capable of explaining not
only the self-attention computation itself but also the role of components such
as positional encoding and residual connections, including numerous later
variants. We also pinpoint potential distinctions between the two concepts
building upon our framework, and make effort to close this gap. We introduce
two independent architectural modifications within transformers. While our
primary objective is interpretability, we empirically observe that image
processing-inspired modifications can also lead to notably improved accuracy
and robustness against data contamination and adversaries across language and
vision tasks as well as better long sequence understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究海底人为物体的埋藏状态对理解局部沉积动力学、评估生态风险、污染物迁移以及危险材料（如弹药）的回收或缓解策略至关重要。

Method: 结合深度基础模型特征与多视角摄影测量，通过CAD模型对齐观测图像并拟合局部平面近似海底，推断埋藏深度。

Result: 在54个物体（包括桶和弹药）的验证中，平均埋藏深度误差约为10厘米，并能反映沉积物迁移过程的空间埋藏模式。

Conclusion: PoseIDON方法实现了海底埋藏的非侵入式、可扩展测绘，支持污染场地的环境评估。

Abstract: The burial state of anthropogenic objects on the seafloor provides insight
into localized sedimentation dynamics and is also critical for assessing
ecological risks, potential pollutant transport, and the viability of recovery
or mitigation strategies for hazardous materials such as munitions. Accurate
burial depth estimation from remote imagery remains difficult due to partial
occlusion, poor visibility, and object degradation. This work introduces a
computer vision pipeline, called PoseIDON, which combines deep foundation model
features with multiview photogrammetry to estimate six degrees of freedom
object pose and the orientation of the surrounding seafloor from ROV video.
Burial depth is inferred by aligning CAD models of the objects with observed
imagery and fitting a local planar approximation of the seafloor. The method is
validated using footage of 54 objects, including barrels and munitions,
recorded at a historic ocean dumpsite in the San Pedro Basin. The model
achieves a mean burial depth error of approximately 10 centimeters and resolves
spatial burial patterns that reflect underlying sediment transport processes.
This approach enables scalable, non-invasive mapping of seafloor burial and
supports environmental assessment at contaminated sites.

Result: 在DeiT上提升2.1%准确率，减少45% FLOPs，性能优于均匀增加标记密度的方法。

Conclusion: DART在多种模型中一致提升性能，计算开销低，代码开源。

Abstract: Recently, non-convolutional models such as the Vision Transformer (ViT) and
Vision Mamba (Vim) have achieved remarkable performance in computer vision
tasks. However, their reliance on fixed-size patches often results in excessive
encoding of background regions and omission of critical local details,
especially when informative objects are sparsely distributed. To address this,
we introduce a fully differentiable Dynamic Adaptive Region Tokenizer (DART),
which adaptively partitions images into content-dependent patches of varying
sizes. DART combines learnable region scores with piecewise differentiable
quantile operations to allocate denser tokens to information-rich areas.
Despite introducing only approximately 1 million (1M) additional parameters,
DART improves accuracy by 2.1% on DeiT (ImageNet-1K). Unlike methods that
uniformly increase token density to capture fine-grained details, DART offers a
more efficient alternative, achieving 45% FLOPs reduction with superior
performance. Extensive experiments on DeiT, Vim, and VideoMamba confirm that
DART consistently enhances accuracy while incurring minimal or even reduced
computational overhead. Code is available at

TL;DR: 论文提出ReconMOST框架，利用数据驱动的扩散模型进行多层海水温度重建，解决了传统方法数据稀疏、计算复杂的问题，并在全球范围内实现高精度重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统海洋温度重建方法因数据稀疏、算法复杂和高计算成本受限，而现有机器学习方法仅适用于海表和局部区域。本文旨在解决这些问题，提出一种全局多层重建方案。

Method: 通过预训练无条件扩散模型学习历史数值模拟数据，生成物理一致的海洋温度分布模式；在生成阶段，利用高精度观测数据引导反向扩散过程，实现精确重建。

Result: 在CMIP6和EN4数据上的实验显示，MSE值分别为0.049（引导）、0.680（重建）和0.633（总体），证明了方法的有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ReconMOST框架在全球多层海洋温度重建中表现出色，能处理92.5%的缺失数据，同时保持高精度和泛化能力。

Abstract: Accurate reconstruction of ocean is essential for reflecting global climate
dynamics and supporting marine meteorological research. Conventional methods
face challenges due to sparse data, algorithmic complexity, and high
computational costs, while increasing usage of machine learning (ML) method
remains limited to reconstruction problems at the sea surface and local
regions, struggling with issues like cloud occlusion. To address these
limitations, this paper proposes ReconMOST, a data-driven guided diffusion
model framework for multi-layer sea temperature reconstruction. Specifically,
we first pre-train an unconditional diffusion model using a large collection of
historical numerical simulation data, enabling the model to attain physically
consistent distribution patterns of ocean temperature fields. During the
generation phase, sparse yet high-accuracy in-situ observational data are
utilized as guidance points for the reverse diffusion process, generating
accurate reconstruction results. Importantly, in regions lacking direct
observational data, the physically consistent spatial distribution patterns
learned during pre-training enable implicitly guided and physically plausible
reconstructions. Our method extends ML-based SST reconstruction to a global,
multi-layer setting, handling over 92.5% missing data while maintaining
reconstruction accuracy, spatial resolution, and superior generalization
capability. We pre-train our model on CMIP6 numerical simulation data and
conduct guided reconstruction experiments on CMIP6 and EN4 analysis data. The
results of mean squared error (MSE) values achieve 0.049 on guidance, 0.680 on
reconstruction, and 0.633 on total, respectively, demonstrating the
effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework. Our source code is

Result: 在20多个图像理解基准测试中表现优异，在图像生成基准GenEval中展现强大生成能力。

Conclusion: Pisces证明了图像理解与生成的协同关系，解耦视觉编码器的优势，推动了统一多模态模型的发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled multimodal
foundation models to tackle both image understanding and generation within a
unified framework. Despite these gains, unified models often underperform
compared to specialized models in either task. A key challenge in developing
unified models lies in the inherent differences between the visual features
needed for image understanding versus generation, as well as the distinct
training processes required for each modality. In this work, we introduce
Pisces, an auto-regressive multimodal foundation model that addresses this
challenge through a novel decoupled visual encoding architecture and tailored
training techniques optimized for multimodal generation. Combined with
meticulous data curation, pretraining, and finetuning, Pisces achieves
competitive performance in both image understanding and image generation. We
evaluate Pisces on over 20 public benchmarks for image understanding, where it
demonstrates strong performance across a wide range of tasks. Additionally, on
GenEval, a widely adopted benchmark for image generation, Pisces exhibits
robust generative capabilities. Our extensive analysis reveals the synergistic
relationship between image understanding and generation, and the benefits of
using separate visual encoders, advancing the field of unified multimodal
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 红外小目标检测在复杂背景下面临低信杂比、目标形态多样和缺乏视觉线索等挑战，现有深度学习方法因目标内在变异性和弱先验导致性能不稳定。

Method: 提出LRRNet框架，采用压缩-重构-减法（CRS）范式，直接在图像域建模低秩背景表示，无需基于块处理或显式矩阵分解。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上，LRRNet优于38种先进方法，检测精度、鲁棒性和计算效率显著提升，平均速度达82.34 FPS，且在噪声环境下表现稳健。

Conclusion: LRRNet首次通过端到端深度网络直接学习低秩背景结构，为红外小目标检测提供了高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) remains a long-standing challenge in
complex backgrounds due to low signal-to-clutter ratios (SCR), diverse target
morphologies, and the absence of distinctive visual cues. While recent deep
learning approaches aim to learn discriminative representations, the intrinsic
variability and weak priors of small targets often lead to unstable
performance. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end IRSTD framework,
termed LRRNet, which leverages the low-rank property of infrared image
backgrounds. Inspired by the physical compressibility of cluttered scenes, our
approach adopts a compression--reconstruction--subtraction (CRS) paradigm to
directly model structure-aware low-rank background representations in the image
domain, without relying on patch-based processing or explicit matrix
decomposition. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to directly
learn low-rank background structures using deep neural networks in an
end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets
demonstrate that LRRNet outperforms 38 state-of-the-art methods in terms of
detection accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. Remarkably, it
achieves real-time performance with an average speed of 82.34 FPS. Evaluations
on the challenging NoisySIRST dataset further confirm the model's resilience to
sensor noise. The source code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线视频内容的快速增长需要更有效的摘要技术，传统单模态方法难以捕捉视频的完整语义。

Method: MF2Summ采用五阶段流程：特征提取、跨模态注意力交互、特征融合、片段预测和关键镜头选择，结合Transformer和NMS算法。

Result: 在SumMe和TVSum数据集上，MF2Summ表现优异，F1分数分别比DSNet模型提高1.9%和0.6%。

Conclusion: MF2Summ通过多模态融合显著提升了视频摘要的性能，优于现有方法。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of online video content necessitates effective video
summarization techniques. Traditional methods, often relying on a single
modality (typically visual), struggle to capture the full semantic richness of
videos. This paper introduces MF2Summ, a novel video summarization model based
on multimodal content understanding, integrating both visual and auditory
information. MF2Summ employs a five-stage process: feature extraction,
cross-modal attention interaction, feature fusion, segment prediction, and key
shot selection. Visual features are extracted using a pre-trained GoogLeNet
model, while auditory features are derived using SoundNet. The core of our
fusion mechanism involves a cross-modal Transformer and an alignment-guided
self-attention Transformer, designed to effectively model inter-modal
dependencies and temporal correspondences. Segment importance, location, and
center-ness are predicted, followed by key shot selection using Non-Maximum
Suppression (NMS) and the Kernel Temporal Segmentation (KTS) algorithm.
Experimental results on the SumMe and TVSum datasets demonstrate that MF2Summ
achieves competitive performance, notably improving F1-scores by 1.9\% and
0.6\% respectively over the DSNet model, and performing favorably against other
state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 传统基于显式运动的生成式视频编码在人体视频压缩中表现不佳，因复杂多样的运动模式导致重建结果失真和运动不准确。

Result: 实验证明IMT范式有效，能实现高效压缩和高保真合成。

Conclusion: IMT为GHVC提供了一种更优的解决方案，克服了显式运动引导的局限性。

Abstract: Beyond traditional hybrid-based video codec, generative video codec could
achieve promising compression performance by evolving high-dimensional signals
into compact feature representations for bitstream compactness at the encoder
side and developing explicit motion fields as intermediate supervision for
high-quality reconstruction at the decoder side. This paradigm has achieved
significant success in face video compression. However, compared to facial
videos, human body videos pose greater challenges due to their more complex and
diverse motion patterns, i.e., when using explicit motion guidance for
Generative Human Video Coding (GHVC), the reconstruction results could suffer
severe distortions and inaccurate motion. As such, this paper highlights the
limitations of explicit motion-based approaches for human body video
compression and investigates the GHVC performance improvement with the aid of
Implicit Motion Transformation, namely IMT. In particular, we propose to
characterize complex human body signal into compact visual features and
transform these features into implicit motion guidance for signal
reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed IMT paradigm, which can facilitate GHVC to achieve high-efficiency
compression and high-fidelity synthesis.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱图像（HSI）因其高维和丰富的光谱信息与自然图像不同，现有对抗攻击方法对其效果有限，需要针对性改进。

Result: 实验表明，该方法生成的对抗样本在公开数据集上对黑盒模型具有高可迁移性，且在防御策略下仍保持攻击性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了HSI对抗样本的可迁移性和攻击鲁棒性。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which pose
security challenges to hyperspectral image (HSI) classification technologies
based on DNNs. In the domain of natural images, numerous transfer-based
adversarial attack methods have been studied. However, HSIs differ from natural
images due to their high-dimensional and rich spectral information. Current
research on HSI adversarial examples remains limited and faces challenges in
fully utilizing the structural and feature information of images. To address
these issues, this paper proposes a novel method to enhance the transferability
of the adversarial examples for HSI classification models. First, while keeping
the image structure unchanged, the proposed method randomly divides the image
into blocks in both spatial and spectral dimensions. Then, various
transformations are applied on a block by block basis to increase input
diversity and mitigate overfitting. Second, a feature distancing loss targeting
intermediate layers is designed, which measures the distance between the
amplified features of the original examples and the features of the adversarial
examples as the primary loss, while the output layer prediction serves as the
auxiliary loss. This guides the perturbation to disrupt the features of the
true class in adversarial examples, effectively enhancing transferability.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the adversarial examples generated by
the proposed method achieve effective transferability to black-box models on
two public HSI datasets. Furthermore, the method maintains robust attack
performance even under defense strategies.

Result: GHN-QAT显著提升了4位量化的精度，并在2位量化中表现优于随机初始化。

Conclusion: GHN-QAT为量化DNN设计提供了新思路，未来可结合量化感知训练进一步优化。

Abstract: Deep neural network (DNN) quantization for fast, efficient inference has been
an important tool in limiting the cost of machine learning (ML) model
inference. Quantization-specific model development techniques such as
regularization, quantization-aware training, and quantization-robustness
penalties have served to greatly boost the accuracy and robustness of modern
DNNs. However, very little exploration has been done on improving the initial
conditions of DNN training for quantization. Just as random weight
initialization has been shown to significantly impact test accuracy of floating
point models, it would make sense that different weight initialization methods
impact quantization robustness of trained models. We present an extensive study
examining the effects of different weight initializations on a variety of CNN
building blocks commonly used in efficient CNNs. This analysis reveals that
even with varying CNN architectures, the choice of random weight initializer
can significantly affect final quantization robustness. Next, we explore a new
method for quantization-robust CNN initialization -- using Graph Hypernetworks
(GHN) to predict parameters of quantized DNNs. Besides showing that
GHN-predicted parameters are quantization-robust after regular float32
pretraining (of the GHN), we find that finetuning GHNs to predict parameters
for quantized graphs (which we call GHN-QAT) can further improve quantized
accuracy of CNNs. Notably, GHN-QAT shows significant accuracy improvements for
even 4-bit quantization and better-than-random accuracy for 2-bits. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first in-depth study on quantization-aware DNN
weight initialization. GHN-QAT offers a novel approach to quantized DNN model
design. Future investigations, such as using GHN-QAT-initialized parameters for
quantization-aware training, can further streamline the DNN quantization
process.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is crucial for clinical diagnosis, yet existing
models are limited by their reliance on explicit human instructions and lack
the active reasoning capabilities to understand complex clinical questions.
While recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
improved medical question-answering (QA) tasks, most methods struggle to
generate precise segmentation masks, limiting their application in automatic
medical diagnosis. In this paper, we introduce medical image reasoning
segmentation, a novel task that aims to generate segmentation masks based on
complex and implicit medical instructions. To address this, we propose
MedSeg-R, an end-to-end framework that leverages the reasoning abilities of
MLLMs to interpret clinical questions while also capable of producing
corresponding precise segmentation masks for medical images. It is built on two
core components: 1) a global context understanding module that interprets
images and comprehends complex medical instructions to generate multi-modal
intermediate tokens, and 2) a pixel-level grounding module that decodes these
tokens to produce precise segmentation masks and textual responses.
Furthermore, we introduce MedSeg-QA, a large-scale dataset tailored for the
medical image reasoning segmentation task. It includes over 10,000 image-mask
pairs and multi-turn conversations, automatically annotated using large
language models and refined through physician reviews. Experiments show
MedSeg-R's superior performance across several benchmarks, achieving high
segmentation accuracy and enabling interpretable textual analysis of medical

Abstract: The growing sophistication of deepfakes presents substantial challenges to
the integrity of media and the preservation of public trust. Concurrently,
vision-language models (VLMs), large language models enhanced with visual
reasoning capabilities, have emerged as promising tools across various domains,
sparking interest in their applicability to deepfake detection. This study
conducts a structured zero-shot evaluation of four prominent VLMs: ChatGPT,
Claude, Gemini, and Grok, focusing on three primary deepfake types: faceswap,
reenactment, and synthetic generation. Leveraging a meticulously assembled
benchmark comprising authentic and manipulated images from diverse sources, we
evaluate each model's classification accuracy and reasoning depth. Our analysis
indicates that while VLMs can produce coherent explanations and detect
surface-level anomalies, they are not yet dependable as standalone detection
systems. We highlight critical failure modes, such as an overemphasis on
stylistic elements and vulnerability to misleading visual patterns like vintage
aesthetics. Nevertheless, VLMs exhibit strengths in interpretability and
contextual analysis, suggesting their potential to augment human expertise in
forensic workflows. These insights imply that although general-purpose models
currently lack the reliability needed for autonomous deepfake detection, they
hold promise as integral components in hybrid or human-in-the-loop detection
frameworks.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the Sheet Music Benchmark (SMB), a dataset of six
hundred and eighty-five pages specifically designed to benchmark Optical Music

textures, including monophony, pianoform, quartet, and others, all encoded in
Common Western Modern Notation using the Humdrum **kern format. Alongside SMB,
we introduce the OMR Normalized Edit Distance (OMR-NED), a new metric tailored
explicitly for evaluating OMR performance. OMR-NED builds upon the widely-used
Symbol Error Rate (SER), offering a fine-grained and detailed error analysis
that covers individual musical elements such as note heads, beams, pitches,
accidentals, and other critical notation features. The resulting numeric score
provided by OMR-NED facilitates clear comparisons, enabling researchers and
end-users alike to identify optimal OMR approaches. Our work thus addresses a

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 蜂蜜品种多样，市场价值不同，但难以一次性收集所有品种训练模型。类增量学习（CIL）技术可解决这一问题。

Method: 研究比较了多种CIL算法，并提出结合CB算法的新方法，通过重新初始化较少使用的神经元来提升网络可塑性。

Result: 实验表明，CB方法将大多数CIL算法的性能提高了1-7%。

Conclusion: CB方法有效提升了CIL算法的性能，为蜂蜜品种分类提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Honey is an important commodity in the global market. Honey types of
different botanical origins provide diversified flavors and health benefits,
thus having different market values. Developing accurate and effective
botanical origin-distinguishing techniques is crucial to protect consumers'
interests. However, it is impractical to collect all the varieties of honey
products at once to train a model for botanical origin differentiation.
Therefore, researchers developed class-incremental learning (CIL) techniques to
address this challenge. This study examined and compared multiple CIL
algorithms on a real-world honey hyperspectral imaging dataset. A novel
technique is also proposed to improve the performance of class-incremental
learning algorithms by combining with a continual backpropagation (CB)
algorithm. The CB method addresses the issue of loss-of-plasticity by
reinitializing a proportion of less-used hidden neurons to inject variability
into neural networks. Experiments showed that CB improved the performance of
most CIL methods by 1-7\%.

*Shuyang Li,Shuang Wang,Zhuangzhuang Sun,Jing Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PSLG-SAM框架通过两阶段方法（粗定位和精细分割）解决RRSIS任务，减少标注负担并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有RRSIS方法对密集标注的依赖和复杂场景解释的挑战。

Method: 两阶段框架：粗定位阶段使用视觉定位网络，精细分割阶段利用SAM模型结合聚类和优化策略。

Result: 在RRSIS-D和RRSIS-M数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PSLG-SAM有效减少标注需求并提升分割精度，适用于复杂场景。

Abstract: The Reference Remote Sensing Image Segmentation (RRSIS) task generates
segmentation masks for specified objects in images based on textual
descriptions, which has attracted widespread attention and research interest.
Current RRSIS methods rely on multi-modal fusion backbones and semantic
segmentation heads but face challenges like dense annotation requirements and
complex scene interpretation. To address these issues, we propose a framework
named \textit{prompt-generated semantic localization guiding Segment Anything
Model}(PSLG-SAM), which decomposes the RRSIS task into two stages: coarse
localization and fine segmentation. In coarse localization stage, a visual
grounding network roughly locates the text-described object. In fine
segmentation stage, the coordinates from the first stage guide the Segment
Anything Model (SAM), enhanced by a clustering-based foreground point generator
and a mask boundary iterative optimization strategy for precise segmentation.
Notably, the second stage can be train-free, significantly reducing the
annotation data burden for the RRSIS task. Additionally, decomposing the RRSIS
task into two stages allows for focusing on specific region segmentation,
avoiding interference from complex scenes.We further contribute a high-quality,
multi-category manually annotated dataset. Experimental validation on two
datasets (RRSIS-D and RRSIS-M) demonstrates that PSLG-SAM achieves significant
performance improvements and surpasses existing state-of-the-art models.Our
code will be made publicly available.

Conclusion: J-DDL显著提升了战斗机表面损伤检测的自动化水平，为未来研究提供了基础。

Abstract: Ensuring the safety and extended operational life of fighter aircraft
necessitates frequent and exhaustive inspections. While surface defect
detection is feasible for human inspectors, manual methods face critical
limitations in scalability, efficiency, and consistency due to the vast surface
area, structural complexity, and operational demands of aircraft maintenance.
We propose a smart surface damage detection and localization system for fighter
aircraft, termed J-DDL. J-DDL integrates 2D images and 3D point clouds of the
entire aircraft surface, captured using a combined system of laser scanners and
cameras, to achieve precise damage detection and localization. Central to our
system is a novel damage detection network built on the YOLO architecture,
specifically optimized for identifying surface defects in 2D aircraft images.
Key innovations include lightweight Fasternet blocks for efficient feature
extraction, an optimized neck architecture incorporating Efficient Multiscale
Attention (EMA) modules for superior feature aggregation, and the introduction
of a novel loss function, Inner-CIOU, to enhance detection accuracy. After
detecting damage in 2D images, the system maps the identified anomalies onto
corresponding 3D point clouds, enabling accurate 3D localization of defects
across the aircraft surface. Our J-DDL not only streamlines the inspection
process but also ensures more comprehensive and detailed coverage of large and
complex aircraft exteriors. To facilitate further advancements in this domain,
we have developed the first publicly available dataset specifically focused on
aircraft damage. Experimental evaluations validate the effectiveness of our
framework, underscoring its potential to significantly advance automated
aircraft inspection technologies.

Conclusion: CogStream任务和CogReasoner模型为流媒体视频推理提供了新的解决方案，代码即将发布。

Abstract: Despite advancements in Video Large Language Models (Vid-LLMs) improving
multimodal understanding, challenges persist in streaming video reasoning due
to its reliance on contextual information. Existing paradigms feed all
available historical contextual information into Vid-LLMs, resulting in a
significant computational burden for visual data processing. Furthermore, the
inclusion of irrelevant context distracts models from key details. This paper
introduces a challenging task called Context-guided Streaming Video Reasoning
(CogStream), which simulates real-world streaming video scenarios, requiring
models to identify the most relevant historical contextual information to
deduce answers for questions about the current stream. To support CogStream, we
present a densely annotated dataset featuring extensive and hierarchical
question-answer pairs, generated by a semi-automatic pipeline. Additionally, we
present CogReasoner as a baseline model. It efficiently tackles this task by
leveraging visual stream compression and historical dialogue retrieval.
Extensive experiments prove the effectiveness of this method. Code will be
released soon.

Abstract: Explaining why the species lives at a particular location is important for
understanding ecological systems and conserving biodiversity. However, existing
ecological workflows are fragmented and often inaccessible to non-specialists.
We propose an end-to-end visual-to-causal framework that transforms a species
image into interpretable causal insights about its habitat preference. The
system integrates species recognition, global occurrence retrieval,
pseudo-absence sampling, and climate data extraction. We then discover causal
structures among environmental features and estimate their influence on species
occurrence using modern causal inference methods. Finally, we generate
statistically grounded, human-readable causal explanations from structured
templates and large language models. We demonstrate the framework on a bee and
a flower species and report early results as part of an ongoing project,
showing the potential of the multimodal AI assistant backed up by a recommended
ecological modeling practice for describing species habitat in
human-understandable language.

Motivation: 现有指标难以检测高性能人脸识别系统中的细微人口统计偏差，尤其是在分数分布的尾部。

Method: 引入Comprehensive Equity Index (CEI)，分别分析真实和冒名顶替分数分布，可配置尾部概率，并考虑整体分布形状。还提出了自动化版本CEI^A。

Result: 实验表明，CEI在检测细微偏差方面优于现有方法，适用于多种数据集和模型。

Conclusion: CEI为操作化的人脸识别公平性评估提供了鲁棒且敏感的工具，方法可推广至其他统计分布尾部分析问题。

Abstract: Demographic bias in high-performance face recognition (FR) systems often
eludes detection by existing metrics, especially with respect to subtle
disparities in the tails of the score distribution. We introduce the
Comprehensive Equity Index (CEI), a novel metric designed to address this
limitation. CEI uniquely analyzes genuine and impostor score distributions
separately, enabling a configurable focus on tail probabilities while also
considering overall distribution shapes. Our extensive experiments (evaluating
state-of-the-art FR systems, intentionally biased models, and diverse datasets)
confirm CEI's superior ability to detect nuanced biases where previous methods
fall short. Furthermore, we present CEI^A, an automated version of the metric
that enhances objectivity and simplifies practical application. CEI provides a
robust and sensitive tool for operational FR fairness assessment. The proposed
methods have been developed particularly for bias evaluation in face biometrics
but, in general, they are applicable for comparing statistical distributions in
any problem where one is interested in analyzing the distribution tails.

Dense visual SLAM, leveraging RGB-D camera systems, offers advantages but faces
challenges in achieving real-time performance, robustness, and scalability for
large-scale scenes. Recent approaches utilizing neural implicit scene
representations show promise but suffer from high computational costs and
memory requirements. ESLAM introduced a plane-based tensor decomposition but
still struggled with memory growth. Addressing these challenges, we propose a
more efficient visual SLAM model, called LRSLAM, utilizing low-rank tensor
decomposition methods. Our approach, leveraging the Six-axis and CP
decompositions, achieves better convergence rates, memory efficiency, and
reconstruction/localization quality than existing state-of-the-art approaches.
Evaluation across diverse indoor RGB-D datasets demonstrates LRSLAM's superior
performance in terms of parameter efficiency, processing time, and accuracy,
retaining reconstruction and localization quality. Our code will be publicly

Abstract: In e-commerce and digital marketing, generating high-fidelity human-product
demonstration videos is important for effective product presentation. However,
most existing frameworks either fail to preserve the identities of both humans
and products or lack an understanding of human-product spatial relationships,
leading to unrealistic representations and unnatural interactions. To address
these challenges, we propose a Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based framework. Our
method simultaneously preserves human identities and product-specific details,
such as logos and textures, by injecting paired human-product reference
information and utilizing an additional masked cross-attention mechanism. We
employ a 3D body mesh template and product bounding boxes to provide precise
motion guidance, enabling intuitive alignment of hand gestures with product
placements. Additionally, structured text encoding is used to incorporate
category-level semantics, enhancing 3D consistency during small rotational
changes across frames. Trained on a hybrid dataset with extensive data
augmentation strategies, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art techniques
in maintaining the identity integrity of both humans and products and
generating realistic demonstration motions. Project page:

Abstract: Learning medical visual representations from image-report pairs through joint
learning has garnered increasing research attention due to its potential to
alleviate the data scarcity problem in the medical domain. The primary
challenges stem from the lengthy reports that feature complex discourse
relations and semantic pathologies. Previous works have predominantly focused
on instance-wise or token-wise cross-modal alignment, often neglecting the
importance of pathological-level consistency. This paper presents a novel
framework PLACE that promotes the Pathological-Level Alignment and enriches the
fine-grained details via Correlation Exploration without additional human
annotations. Specifically, we propose a novel pathological-level cross-modal
alignment (PCMA) approach to maximize the consistency of pathology observations
from both images and reports. To facilitate this, a Visual Pathology
Observation Extractor is introduced to extract visual pathological observation
representations from localized tokens. The PCMA module operates independently
of any external disease annotations, enhancing the generalizability and
robustness of our methods. Furthermore, we design a proxy task that enforces
the model to identify correlations among image patches, thereby enriching the
fine-grained details crucial for various downstream tasks. Experimental results
demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves new state-of-the-art
performance on multiple downstream tasks, including classification,
image-to-text retrieval, semantic segmentation, object detection and report
generation.

Method: 利用文本生成图像模型生成多样化图像，结合类热图和可学习原型增强局部特征表示，并融合提示调优和适配器学习。

Result: 在多个基准测试中平均提升3.47%的识别性能。

Conclusion: T2I-PAL无需全语义标注图像，减少人工标注负担，且兼容现有CLIP框架。

Abstract: Benefited from image-text contrastive learning, pre-trained vision-language
models, e.g., CLIP, allow to direct leverage texts as images (TaI) for
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). While CLIP is capable of making image
features to be similar to the corresponding text features, the modality gap
remains a nontrivial issue and limits image recognition performance of TaI.
Using multi-label image recognition (MLR) as an example, we present a novel
method, called T2I-PAL to tackle the modality gap issue when using only text
captions for PEFT. The core design of T2I-PAL is to leverage pre-trained
text-to-image generation models to generate photo-realistic and diverse images
from text captions, thereby reducing the modality gap. To further enhance MLR,
T2I-PAL incorporates a class-wise heatmap and learnable prototypes. This
aggregates local similarities, making the representation of local visual
features more robust and informative for multi-label recognition. For better
PEFT, we further combine both prompt tuning and adapter learning to enhance
classification performance. T2I-PAL offers significant advantages: it
eliminates the need for fully semantically annotated training images, thereby
reducing the manual annotation workload, and it preserves the intrinsic mode of
the CLIP model, allowing for seamless integration with any existing CLIP
framework. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, including MS-COCO,
VOC2007, and NUS-WIDE, show that our T2I-PAL can boost recognition performance
by 3.47% in average above the top-ranked state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: HyperSphereDiff通过几何对齐和不确定性建模，显著提升了超球面数据的生成性能。

Abstract: Do contemporary diffusion models preserve the class geometry of
hyperspherical data? Standard diffusion models rely on isotropic Gaussian noise
in the forward process, inherently favoring Euclidean spaces. However, many
real-world problems involve non-Euclidean distributions, such as hyperspherical
manifolds, where class-specific patterns are governed by angular geometry
within hypercones. When modeled in Euclidean space, these angular subtleties
are lost, leading to suboptimal generative performance. To address this
limitation, we introduce HyperSphereDiff to align hyperspherical structures
with directional noise, preserving class geometry and effectively capturing
angular uncertainty. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that
this approach aligns the generative process with the intrinsic geometry of
hyperspherical data, resulting in more accurate and geometry-aware generative
models. We evaluate our framework on four object datasets and two face
datasets, showing that incorporating angular uncertainty better preserves the
underlying hyperspherical manifold. Resources are available at:

Conclusion: 非对称随机掩码策略在自蒸馏框架中有效，能增强模型鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a
wide range of vision tasks. In particular, self-distillation frameworks such as
DINO have contributed significantly to these advances. Within such frameworks,
random masking is often utilized to improve training efficiency and introduce
regularization. However, recent studies have raised concerns that
indiscriminate random masking may inadvertently eliminate critical semantic
information, motivating the development of more informed masking strategies. In
this study, we explore the role of random masking in the self-distillation
setting, focusing on the DINO framework. Specifically, we apply random masking
exclusively to the student's global view, while preserving the student's local
views and the teacher's global view in their original, unmasked forms. This
design leverages DINO's multi-view augmentation scheme to retain clean
supervision while inducing robustness through masked inputs. We evaluate our
approach using DINO-Tiny on the mini-ImageNet dataset and show that random
masking under this asymmetric setup yields more robust and fine-grained
attention maps, ultimately enhancing downstream performance.

Conclusion: HEA-MM框架为航空制造提供了一种高效的误差评估工具。

Abstract: The most essential feature of aviation equipment is high quality, including
high performance, high stability and high reliability. In this paper, we
propose a novel hierarchical error assessment framework for aircraft CAD models
within a manufacturing-and-measurement platform, termed HEA-MM. HEA-MM employs
structured light scanners to obtain comprehensive 3D measurements of
manufactured workpieces. The measured point cloud is registered with the
reference CAD model, followed by an error analysis conducted at three
hierarchical levels: global, part, and feature. At the global level, the error
analysis evaluates the overall deviation of the scanned point cloud from the
reference CAD model. At the part level, error analysis is performed on these
patches underlying the point clouds. We propose a novel optimization-based
primitive refinement method to obtain a set of meaningful patches of point
clouds. Two basic operations, splitting and merging, are introduced to refine
the coarse primitives. At the feature level, error analysis is performed on
circular holes, which are commonly found in CAD models. To facilitate it, a
two-stage algorithm is introduced for the detection of circular holes. First,
edge points are identified using a tensor-voting algorithm. Then, multiple
circles are fitted through a hypothesize-and-clusterize framework, ensuring
accurate detection and analysis of the circular features. Experimental results
on various aircraft CAD models demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
method.

TL;DR: SSP框架通过语义解耦的空间分区方法，解决了高密度场景中定向目标检测的样本分配和实例混淆问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高密度场景中定向目标检测的标注成本高，现有方法因规则设计僵化导致样本分配不足和实例混淆。

Method: SSP结合规则驱动的先验注入和数据驱动的标签净化，提出像素级和语义级空间分区方法，优化样本分配和伪标签生成。

Result: 在DOTA-v1.0等数据集上，SSP在点监督下达到45.78% mAP，优于SOTA方法PointOBB-v2 4.10%。

Conclusion: SSP框架有效提升了定向目标检测的性能，尤其在密集场景中表现优异。

Abstract: Recent remote sensing tech advancements drive imagery growth, making oriented
object detection rapid development, yet hindered by labor-intensive annotation
for high-density scenes. Oriented object detection with point supervision
offers a cost-effective solution for densely packed scenes in remote sensing,
yet existing methods suffer from inadequate sample assignment and instance
confusion due to rigid rule-based designs. To address this, we propose SSP
(Semantic-decoupled Spatial Partition), a unified framework that synergizes
rule-driven prior injection and data-driven label purification. Specifically,
SSP introduces two core innovations: 1) Pixel-level Spatial Partition-based
Sample Assignment, which compactly estimates the upper and lower bounds of
object scales and mines high-quality positive samples and hard negative samples
through spatial partitioning of pixel maps. 2) Semantic Spatial Partition-based
Box Extraction, which derives instances from spatial partitions modulated by
semantic maps and reliably converts them into bounding boxes to form
pseudo-labels for supervising the learning of downstream detectors. Experiments
on DOTA-v1.0 and others demonstrate SSP\' s superiority: it achieves 45.78% mAP
under point supervision, outperforming SOTA method PointOBB-v2 by 4.10%.
Furthermore, when integrated with ORCNN and ReDet architectures, the SSP
framework achieves mAP values of 47.86% and 48.50%, respectively. The code is

TL;DR: LatentCSI利用预训练的潜在扩散模型（LDM）从WiFi CSI测量生成物理环境图像，避免了传统方法的复杂计算，并通过文本引导实现可控性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法如GANs计算复杂且效率低，LatentCSI旨在通过轻量级网络和LDM实现高效高质量的图像生成。

Method: 使用轻量级网络将CSI振幅映射到LDM的潜在空间，结合文本引导的扩散模型和预训练解码器生成高分辨率图像。

Result: 在公开数据集和自采数据集上验证，LatentCSI在计算效率和感知质量上优于基线方法，并支持文本引导控制。

Conclusion: LatentCSI提供了一种高效、高质量的图像生成方法，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: We present LatentCSI, a novel method for generating images of the physical
environment from WiFi CSI measurements that leverages a pretrained latent
diffusion model (LDM). Unlike prior approaches that rely on complex and
computationally intensive techniques such as GANs, our method employs a
lightweight neural network to map CSI amplitudes directly into the latent space
of an LDM. We then apply the LDM's denoising diffusion model to the latent
representation with text-based guidance before decoding using the LDM's
pretrained decoder to obtain a high-resolution image. This design bypasses the
challenges of pixel-space image generation and avoids the explicit image
encoding stage typically required in conventional image-to-image pipelines,
enabling efficient and high-quality image synthesis. We validate our approach
on two datasets: a wide-band CSI dataset we collected with off-the-shelf WiFi
devices and cameras; and a subset of the publicly available MM-Fi dataset. The
results demonstrate that LatentCSI outperforms baselines of comparable
complexity trained directly on ground-truth images in both computational
efficiency and perceptual quality, while additionally providing practical
advantages through its unique capacity for text-guided controllability.

Conclusion: MSTAR为场景文本检索提供了一种高效、灵活的解决方案，显著降低了标注成本并提升了性能。

Abstract: Scene text retrieval has made significant progress with the assistance of
accurate text localization. However, existing approaches typically require
costly bounding box annotations for training. Besides, they mostly adopt a
customized retrieval strategy but struggle to unify various types of queries to
meet diverse retrieval needs. To address these issues, we introduce Muti-query
Scene Text retrieval with Attention Recycling (MSTAR), a box-free approach for
scene text retrieval. It incorporates progressive vision embedding to
dynamically capture the multi-grained representation of texts and harmonizes
free-style text queries with style-aware instructions. Additionally, a
multi-instance matching module is integrated to enhance vision-language
alignment. Furthermore, we build the Multi-Query Text Retrieval (MQTR) dataset,
the first benchmark designed to evaluate the multi-query scene text retrieval
capability of models, comprising four query types and 16k images. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method across seven public
datasets and the MQTR dataset. Notably, MSTAR marginally surpasses the previous
state-of-the-art model by 6.4% in MAP on Total-Text while eliminating box
annotation costs. Moreover, on the MQTR benchmark, MSTAR significantly
outperforms the previous models by an average of 8.5%. The code and datasets

Motivation: 现有文本到纹理合成方法因扩散过程中纹理信息整合不足和视角选择固定，导致纹理一致性差。

Result: 在Objaverse和ShapeNet数据集上，TexTailor在生成视角一致纹理方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TexTailor通过改进纹理整合和视角选择，显著提升了纹理合成的质量和一致性。

Abstract: We present TexTailor, a novel method for generating consistent object
textures from textual descriptions. Existing text-to-texture synthesis
approaches utilize depth-aware diffusion models to progressively generate
images and synthesize textures across predefined multiple viewpoints. However,
these approaches lead to a gradual shift in texture properties across
viewpoints due to (1) insufficient integration of previously synthesized
textures at each viewpoint during the diffusion process and (2) the
autoregressive nature of the texture synthesis process. Moreover, the
predefined selection of camera positions, which does not account for the
object's geometry, limits the effective use of texture information synthesized
from different viewpoints, ultimately degrading overall texture consistency. In
TexTailor, we address these issues by (1) applying a resampling scheme that
repeatedly integrates information from previously synthesized textures within
the diffusion process, and (2) fine-tuning a depth-aware diffusion model on
these resampled textures. During this process, we observed that using only a
few training images restricts the model's original ability to generate
high-fidelity images aligned with the conditioning, and therefore propose an
performance preservation loss to mitigate this issue. Additionally, we improve
the synthesis of view-consistent textures by adaptively adjusting camera
positions based on the object's geometry. Experiments on a subset of the
Objaverse dataset and the ShapeNet car dataset demonstrate that TexTailor
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in synthesizing view-consistent textures.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了医学影像中文本与影像对齐问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Latent Diffusion Models have shown remarkable results in text-guided image
synthesis in recent years. In the domain of natural (RGB) images, recent works
have shown that such models can be adapted to various vision-language
downstream tasks with little to no supervision involved. On the contrary,
text-to-image Latent Diffusion Models remain relatively underexplored in the
field of medical imaging, primarily due to limited data availability (e.g., due
to privacy concerns). In this work, focusing on the chest X-ray modality, we
first demonstrate that a standard text-conditioned Latent Diffusion Model has
not learned to align clinically relevant information in free-text radiology
reports with the corresponding areas of the given scan. Then, to alleviate this
issue, we propose a fine-tuning framework to improve multi-modal alignment in a
pre-trained model such that it can be efficiently repurposed for downstream
tasks such as phrase grounding. Our method sets a new state-of-the-art on a
standard benchmark dataset (MS-CXR), while also exhibiting robust performance
on out-of-distribution data (VinDr-CXR). Our code will be made publicly
available.

Conclusion: SymmFlow为多任务学习提供了高效统一的解决方案，代码将开源。

Abstract: Flow Matching has emerged as a powerful framework for learning continuous
transformations between distributions, enabling high-fidelity generative
modeling. This work introduces Symmetrical Flow Matching (SymmFlow), a new
formulation that unifies semantic segmentation, classification, and image
generation within a single model. Using a symmetric learning objective,
SymmFlow models forward and reverse transformations jointly, ensuring
bi-directional consistency, while preserving sufficient entropy for generative
diversity. A new training objective is introduced to explicitly retain semantic
information across flows, featuring efficient sampling while preserving
semantic structure, allowing for one-step segmentation and classification
without iterative refinement. Unlike previous approaches that impose strict
one-to-one mapping between masks and images, SymmFlow generalizes to flexible
conditioning, supporting both pixel-level and image-level class labels.
Experimental results on various benchmarks demonstrate that SymmFlow achieves
state-of-the-art performance on semantic image synthesis, obtaining FID scores
of 11.9 on CelebAMask-HQ and 7.0 on COCO-Stuff with only 25 inference steps.
Additionally, it delivers competitive results on semantic segmentation and
shows promising capabilities in classification tasks. The code will be publicly

Motivation: 现有视频生成模型在特定维度（如实例保留、运动合理性）上仍需微调，但传统方法依赖人工标注和高计算资源。

Method: 设计基于提示的数据引擎和奖励引导的训练策略，利用预训练视觉语言模型的反馈优化样本权重。

Result: 在VBench-2.0基准测试中，GigaVideo-1平均提升4%性能，仅需4 GPU小时。

Conclusion: GigaVideo-1高效且无需人工标注，为视频生成微调提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Recent progress in diffusion models has greatly enhanced video generation
quality, yet these models still require fine-tuning to improve specific
dimensions like instance preservation, motion rationality, composition, and
physical plausibility. Existing fine-tuning approaches often rely on human
annotations and large-scale computational resources, limiting their
practicality. In this work, we propose GigaVideo-1, an efficient fine-tuning
framework that advances video generation without additional human supervision.
Rather than injecting large volumes of high-quality data from external sources,
GigaVideo-1 unlocks the latent potential of pre-trained video diffusion models
through automatic feedback. Specifically, we focus on two key aspects of the
fine-tuning process: data and optimization. To improve fine-tuning data, we
design a prompt-driven data engine that constructs diverse, weakness-oriented
training samples. On the optimization side, we introduce a reward-guided
training strategy, which adaptively weights samples using feedback from
pre-trained vision-language models with a realism constraint. We evaluate
GigaVideo-1 on the VBench-2.0 benchmark using Wan2.1 as the baseline across 17
evaluation dimensions. Experiments show that GigaVideo-1 consistently improves
performance on almost all the dimensions with an average gain of about 4% using
only 4 GPU-hours. Requiring no manual annotations and minimal real data,
GigaVideo-1 demonstrates both effectiveness and efficiency. Code, model, and
data will be publicly available.

Motivation: 现有原型方法在医学图像中可视化不一致且过于细粒度，难以解释病灶范围。

Method: PiPViT利用ViT捕获长距离依赖关系，结合对比学习和多分辨率输入处理，学习可解释的原型。

Result: 在视网膜OCT图像分类任务中，PiPViT性能与现有方法相当，且原型更具临床意义。

Conclusion: PiPViT能透明解释决策，辅助临床诊断。

Abstract: Background and Objective: Prototype-based methods improve interpretability by
learning fine-grained part-prototypes; however, their visualization in the
input pixel space is not always consistent with human-understandable
biomarkers. In addition, well-known prototype-based approaches typically learn
extremely granular prototypes that are less interpretable in medical imaging,
where both the presence and extent of biomarkers and lesions are critical.
  Methods: To address these challenges, we propose PiPViT (Patch-based Visual
Interpretable Prototypes), an inherently interpretable prototypical model for
image recognition. Leveraging a vision transformer (ViT), PiPViT captures
long-range dependencies among patches to learn robust, human-interpretable
prototypes that approximate lesion extent only using image-level labels.
Additionally, PiPViT benefits from contrastive learning and multi-resolution
input processing, which enables effective localization of biomarkers across
scales.
  Results: We evaluated PiPViT on retinal OCT image classification across four
datasets, where it achieved competitive quantitative performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods while delivering more meaningful explanations.
Moreover, quantitative evaluation on a hold-out test set confirms that the
learned prototypes are semantically and clinically relevant. We believe PiPViT
can transparently explain its decisions and assist clinicians in understanding
diagnostic outcomes. Github page: https://github.com/marziehoghbaie/PiPViT

Conclusion: 该方法为高效、低资源消耗的Deepfake检测提供了可行方案。

Abstract: In the digital age, Deepfake present a formidable challenge by using advanced
artificial intelligence to create highly convincing manipulated content,
undermining information authenticity and security. These sophisticated
fabrications surpass traditional detection methods in complexity and realism.
To address this issue, we aim to harness cutting-edge deep learning
methodologies to engineer an innovative deepfake detection model. However, most
of the models designed for deepfake detection are large, causing heavy storage
and memory consumption. In this research, we propose a lightweight convolution
neural network (CNN) with squeeze and excitation block attention (SE) for
Deepfake detection. The SE block module is designed to perform dynamic
channel-wise feature recalibration. The SE block allows the network to
emphasize informative features and suppress less useful ones, which leads to a
more efficient and effective learning module. This module is integrated with a
simple sequential model to perform Deepfake detection. The model is smaller in
size and it achieves competing accuracy with the existing models for deepfake
detection tasks. The model achieved an overall classification accuracy of
94.14% and AUC-ROC score of 0.985 on the Style GAN dataset from the Diverse
Fake Face Dataset. Our proposed approach presents a promising avenue for
combating the Deepfake challenge with minimal computational resources,
developing efficient and scalable solutions for digital content verification.

Motivation: 传统CAPTCHA方案在深度学习攻击下易受攻击，现有对抗攻击方法依赖原图特征，导致图像失真且适用性受限。

Method: 提出UAC框架，利用大语言模型生成对抗样本；目标攻击采用EDICT方法优化扩散模型的双隐变量；非目标攻击采用BP-UAC策略，结合多模态梯度和双路径优化。

Result: BP-UAC在多种系统中实现高攻击成功率，生成的CAPTCHA对人类和DNN均难以区分。

Conclusion: UAC框架有效提升CAPTCHA的多样性和对抗攻击效果，适用于多种攻击场景。

Abstract: With the rapid advancements in deep learning, traditional CAPTCHA schemes are
increasingly vulnerable to automated attacks powered by deep neural networks
(DNNs). Existing adversarial attack methods often rely on original image
characteristics, resulting in distortions that hinder human interpretation and
limit applicability in scenarios lacking initial input images. To address these
challenges, we propose the Unsourced Adversarial CAPTCHA (UAC), a novel
framework generating high-fidelity adversarial examples guided by
attacker-specified text prompts. Leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM), UAC
enhances CAPTCHA diversity and supports both targeted and untargeted attacks.
For targeted attacks, the EDICT method optimizes dual latent variables in a
diffusion model for superior image quality. In untargeted attacks, especially
for black-box scenarios, we introduce bi-path unsourced adversarial CAPTCHA
(BP-UAC), a two-step optimization strategy employing multimodal gradients and
bi-path optimization for efficient misclassification. Experiments show BP-UAC
achieves high attack success rates across diverse systems, generating natural
CAPTCHAs indistinguishable to humans and DNNs.

Motivation: 解决未成年人数据不足和分布偏移问题，提升年龄估计和未成年人检测的准确性。

Method: 使用冻结的FaRL视觉-语言骨干网络，结合紧凑的两层MLP，共享特征于一个年龄回归头和四个二元未成年人检测头。采用α-重加权焦点损失和年龄平衡的小批量采样。

Result: 在ASORES-39k测试集上，年龄估计误差从5.733降至5.656年，18岁以下检测F2分数从0.801提升至0.857。在ASWIFT-20k测试集上，召回率保持0.99，F2分数从0.742提升至0.833。

Conclusion: 多任务架构和优化策略显著提升了未成年人检测的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Accurate automatic screening of minors in unconstrained images demands models
that are robust to distribution shift and resilient to the children
under-representation in publicly available data. To overcome these issues, we
propose a multi-task architecture with dedicated under/over-age discrimination
tasks based on a frozen FaRL vision-language backbone joined with a compact
two-layer MLP that shares features across one age-regression head and four
binary under-age heads for age thresholds of 12, 15, 18, and 21 years, focusing
on the legally critical age range. To address the severe class imbalance, we
introduce an $\alpha$-reweighted focal-style loss and age-balanced mini-batch
sampling, which equalizes twelve age bins during stochastic optimization.
Further improvement is achieved with an age gap that removes edge cases from
the loss.
  Moreover, we set a rigorous evaluation by proposing the Overall Under-Age
Benchmark, with 303k cleaned training images and 110k test images, defining
both the "ASORES-39k" restricted overall test, which removes the noisiest
domains, and the age estimation wild shifts test "ASWIFT-20k" of 20k-images,
stressing extreme pose ($>$45{\deg}), expression, and low image quality to
emulate real-world shifts.
  Trained on the cleaned overall set with resampling and age gap, our multiage
model "F" lowers the root-mean-square-error on the ASORES-39k restricted test
from 5.733 (age-only baseline) to 5.656 years and lifts under-18 detection from
F2 score of 0.801 to 0.857 at 1% false-adult rate. Under the domain shift to
the wild data of ASWIFT-20k, the same configuration nearly sustains 0.99 recall
while boosting F2 from 0.742 to 0.833 with respect to the age-only baseline,
demonstrating strong generalization under distribution shift. For the under-12
and under-15 tasks, the respective boosts in F2 are from 0.666 to 0.955 and
from 0.689 to 0.916, respectively.

Result: 在EgoObjects数据集上验证，HyperCLIC在多粒度任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: HyperCLIC能有效处理层次化数据，提升多粒度泛化能力。

Abstract: Continual learning has traditionally focused on classifying either instances
or classes, but real-world applications, such as robotics and self-driving
cars, require models to handle both simultaneously. To mirror real-life
scenarios, we introduce the task of continual learning of instances and
classes, at the same time. This task challenges models to adapt to multiple
levels of granularity over time, which requires balancing fine-grained instance
recognition with coarse-grained class generalization. In this paper, we
identify that classes and instances naturally form a hierarchical structure. To
model these hierarchical relationships, we propose HyperCLIC, a continual
learning algorithm that leverages hyperbolic space, which is uniquely suited
for hierarchical data due to its ability to represent tree-like structures with
low distortion and compact embeddings. Our framework incorporates hyperbolic
classification and distillation objectives, enabling the continual embedding of
hierarchical relations. To evaluate performance across multiple granularities,
we introduce continual hierarchical metrics. We validate our approach on
EgoObjects, the only dataset that captures the complexity of hierarchical
object recognition in dynamic real-world environments. Empirical results show
that HyperCLIC operates effectively at multiple granularities with improved
hierarchical generalization.

Conclusion: UMBD框架能无缝集成现有COD模型，结合判别与生成优势，显著提升检测性能。

Abstract: Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) presents inherent challenges due to the
subtle visual differences between targets and their backgrounds. While existing
methods have made notable progress, there remains significant potential for
post-processing refinement that has yet to be fully explored. To address this
limitation, we propose the Uncertainty-Masked Bernoulli Diffusion (UMBD) model,
the first generative refinement framework specifically designed for COD. UMBD
introduces an uncertainty-guided masking mechanism that selectively applies
Bernoulli diffusion to residual regions with poor segmentation quality,
enabling targeted refinement while preserving correctly segmented areas. To
support this process, we design the Hybrid Uncertainty Quantification Network
(HUQNet), which employs a multi-branch architecture and fuses uncertainty from
multiple sources to improve estimation accuracy. This enables adaptive guidance
during the generative sampling process. The proposed UMBD framework can be
seamlessly integrated with a wide range of existing Encoder-Decoder-based COD
models, combining their discriminative capabilities with the generative
advantages of diffusion-based refinement. Extensive experiments across multiple
COD benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance improvements, achieving
average gains of 5.5% in MAE and 3.2% in weighted F-measure with only modest
computational overhead. Code will be released.

Abstract: Quality management in semiconductor manufacturing often relies on template
matching with known golden standards. For Indium-Phosphide (InP) multi-project
wafer manufacturing, low production scale and high design variability lead to
such golden standards being typically unavailable. Defect detection, in turn,
is manual and labor-intensive. This work addresses this challenge by proposing
a methodology to generate a synthetic golden standard using Deep Neural
Networks, trained to simulate photo-realistic InP wafer images from CAD data.
We evaluate various training objectives and assess the quality of the simulated
images on both synthetic data and InP wafer photographs. Our
deep-learning-based method outperforms a baseline decision-tree-based approach,
enabling the use of a 'simulated golden die' from CAD plans in any user-defined
region of a wafer for more efficient defect detection. We apply our method to a
template matching procedure, to demonstrate its practical utility in surface
defect detection.

TL;DR: IQE-CLIP是一种基于CLIP的零样本和少样本异常检测框架，专为医学领域设计，通过结合文本和视觉信息生成异常敏感的嵌入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CLIP方法在医学领域异常检测中表现不足，且依赖特定场景的提示设计。

Method: 提出IQE-CLIP，结合类基和可学习提示令牌，并设计实例感知查询模块。

Result: 在六个医学数据集上取得最优性能。

Conclusion: IQE-CLIP在医学异常检测中表现出色，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models, such as CLIP, have significantly
improved performance in zero- and few-shot anomaly detection (ZFSAD) tasks.
However, most existing CLIP-based methods assume prior knowledge of categories
and rely on carefully designed prompts tailored to specific scenarios. While
these text prompts capture semantic information in the textual space, they
often fail to distinguish normal and anomalous instances in the joint embedding
space. Moreover, most ZFSAD approaches focus on industrial domains, with
limited exploration in medical tasks. To address these limitations, we propose
IQE-CLIP, a novel framework for ZFSAD in the medical domain. We show that query
embeddings integrating both textual and instance-aware visual information serve
as more effective indicators of anomalies. Specifically, we introduce
class-based and learnable prompting tokens to better adapt CLIP to the medical
setting. Furthermore, we design an instance-aware query module that extracts
region-level contextual information from both modalities, enabling the
generation of anomaly-sensitive embeddings. Extensive experiments on six
medical datasets demonstrate that IQE-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both zero-shot and few-shot settings. Code and data are

TL;DR: PosterCraft是一个统一框架，用于生成高质量海报，通过多阶段优化流程提升文本渲染、布局和美学效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成美观海报需要复杂的文本渲染和艺术内容整合，现有方法模块化且布局固定，难以实现灵活设计。

Method: 采用级联工作流：大规模文本渲染优化、区域感知微调、美学文本强化学习和联合视觉语言反馈细化。

Result: 在渲染准确性、布局连贯性和视觉吸引力上显著优于开源基线，接近商业系统水平。

Conclusion: PosterCraft通过自动化数据构建和多阶段优化，实现了高质量海报生成，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Generating aesthetic posters is more challenging than simple design images:
it requires not only precise text rendering but also the seamless integration
of abstract artistic content, striking layouts, and overall stylistic harmony.
To address this, we propose PosterCraft, a unified framework that abandons
prior modular pipelines and rigid, predefined layouts, allowing the model to
freely explore coherent, visually compelling compositions. PosterCraft employs
a carefully designed, cascaded workflow to optimize the generation of
high-aesthetic posters: (i) large-scale text-rendering optimization on our
newly introduced Text-Render-2M dataset; (ii) region-aware supervised
fine-tuning on HQ-Poster100K; (iii) aesthetic-text-reinforcement learning via
best-of-n preference optimization; and (iv) joint vision-language feedback
refinement. Each stage is supported by a fully automated data-construction
pipeline tailored to its specific needs, enabling robust training without
complex architectural modifications. Evaluated on multiple experiments,
PosterCraft significantly outperforms open-source baselines in rendering
accuracy, layout coherence, and overall visual appeal-approaching the quality
of SOTA commercial systems. Our code, models, and datasets can be found in the

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于笔画的循环放大器（SbCA）模型，用于超大规模图像超分辨率任务，解决了传统方法在超出训练范围时性能下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统任意尺度图像超分辨率方法在超出训练范围时性能显著下降，导致模糊问题。

Method: SbCA通过笔画向量放大器和细节补全模块分解图像为矢量图形并进行放大，采用循环策略迭代优化细节。

Result: 实验表明，SbCA在超大规模上采样任务（如×100）中显著优于现有方法，生成高质量图像。

Conclusion: SbCA有效解决了分布漂移问题，消除了伪影和模糊，实现了高保真图像重建。

Abstract: Prior Arbitrary-Scale Image Super-Resolution (ASISR) methods often experience
a significant performance decline when the upsampling factor exceeds the range
covered by the training data, introducing substantial blurring. To address this
issue, we propose a unified model, Stroke-based Cyclic Amplifier (SbCA), for
ultra-large upsampling tasks. The key of SbCA is the stroke vector amplifier,
which decomposes the image into a series of strokes represented as vector
graphics for magnification. Then, the detail completion module also restores
missing details, ensuring high-fidelity image reconstruction. Our cyclic
strategy achieves ultra-large upsampling by iteratively refining details with
this unified SbCA model, trained only once for all, while keeping sub-scales
within the training range. Our approach effectively addresses the distribution
drift issue and eliminates artifacts, noise and blurring, producing
high-quality, high-resolution super-resolved images. Experimental validations
on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms existing methods in ultra-large upsampling tasks
(e.g. $\times100$), delivering visual quality far superior to state-of-the-art
techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类通过观察世界获取物理知识并应用于动态场景推理，现有方法缺乏物理知识整合和多样化场景验证。

Method: SlotPi结合了基于哈密顿原理的物理模块和时空预测模块，用于动态预测。

Result: 模型在预测和视觉问答任务中表现优异，并在真实世界数据集上验证了其适应性。

Conclusion: SlotPi的强适应性为开发更先进的世界模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning about dynamics governed by physical laws through
visual observation, akin to human capabilities in the real world, poses
significant challenges. Currently, object-centric dynamic simulation methods,
which emulate human behavior, have achieved notable progress but overlook two
critical aspects: 1) the integration of physical knowledge into models. Humans
gain physical insights by observing the world and apply this knowledge to
accurately reason about various dynamic scenarios; 2) the validation of model
adaptability across diverse scenarios. Real-world dynamics, especially those
involving fluids and objects, demand models that not only capture object
interactions but also simulate fluid flow characteristics. To address these
gaps, we introduce SlotPi, a slot-based physics-informed object-centric
reasoning model. SlotPi integrates a physical module based on Hamiltonian
principles with a spatio-temporal prediction module for dynamic forecasting.
Our experiments highlight the model's strengths in tasks such as prediction and
Visual Question Answering (VQA) on benchmark and fluid datasets. Furthermore,
we have created a real-world dataset encompassing object interactions, fluid
dynamics, and fluid-object interactions, on which we validated our model's
capabilities. The model's robust performance across all datasets underscores
its strong adaptability, laying a foundation for developing more advanced world
models.

Abstract: This work introduces a robot navigation controller that combines event
cameras and other sensors with reinforcement learning to enable real-time
human-centered navigation and obstacle avoidance. Unlike conventional
image-based controllers, which operate at fixed rates and suffer from motion
blur and latency, this approach leverages the asynchronous nature of event
cameras to process visual information over flexible time intervals, enabling
adaptive inference and control. The framework integrates event-based
perception, additional range sensing, and policy optimization via Deep
Deterministic Policy Gradient, with an initial imitation learning phase to
improve sample efficiency. Promising results are achieved in simulated
environments, demonstrating robust navigation, pedestrian following, and
obstacle avoidance. A demo video is available at the project website.

TL;DR: 提出了一种零样本、基于文本查询的视频摘要方法，无需训练数据，通过结合视频语言模型和大语言模型，实现了用户可控的视频摘要生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频数据的爆炸性增长需要灵活的用户可控摘要工具，现有方法依赖数据集或无法结合用户自然语言意图。

Method: 通过分段视频、生成场景描述、利用LLM评分，并通过新指标（一致性和独特性）传播分数，生成细粒度帧重要性。

Result: 在SumMe和TVSum上超越所有无监督方法，并在QFVS基准上表现优异。

Conclusion: 预训练多模态模型结合提示和分数传播，为通用文本查询视频摘要提供了强大基础。

Abstract: The explosive growth of video data intensified the need for flexible
user-controllable summarization tools that can operate without domain-specific
training data. Existing methods either rely on datasets, limiting
generalization, or cannot incorporate user intent expressed in natural
language. We introduce Prompts-to-Summaries: the first zero-shot,
text-queryable video summarizer that converts off-the-shelf video-language
models (VidLMs) captions into user-guided skims via large language models
(LLMs) judging, without the use of training data at all, beating all
unsupervised and matching supervised methods. Our pipeline (i) segments raw
video footage into coherent scenes, (ii) generates rich scene-level
descriptions through a memory-efficient, batch-style VidLM prompting scheme
that scales to hours-long videos on a single GPU, (iii) leverages an LLM as a
judge to assign scene-level importance scores under a carefully crafted prompt,
and finally, (iv) propagates those scores to short segments level via two new
metrics: consistency (temporal coherency) and uniqueness (novelty), yielding
fine-grained frame importance. On SumMe and TVSum, our data-free approach
surpasses all prior data-hungry unsupervised methods. It also performs
competitively on the Query-Focused Video Summarization (QFVS) benchmark,
despite using no training data and the competing methods requiring supervised
frame-level importance. To spur further research, we release VidSum-Reason, a
new query-driven dataset featuring long-tailed concepts and multi-step
reasoning; our framework attains robust F1 scores and serves as the first
challenging baseline. Overall, our results demonstrate that pretrained
multimodal models, when orchestrated with principled prompting and score
propagation, already provide a powerful foundation for universal,
text-queryable video summarization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统无监督DIR方法在稀疏特征和大位移场景下表现不佳，SmoothProper旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 集成基于对偶的优化层和定制交互项，实现信号传播、平滑性和结构一致性。

Result: 在视网膜血管数据集上，注册误差降至1.88像素，首次有效解决两大挑战。

Conclusion: SmoothPrope是一种高效、无需调参的无监督DIR方法，适用于复杂场景。

Abstract: Learning-based deformable image registration (DIR) accelerates alignment by
amortizing traditional optimization via neural networks. Label supervision
further enhances accuracy, enabling efficient and precise nonlinear alignment
of unseen scans. However, images with sparse features amid large smooth
regions, such as retinal vessels, introduce aperture and large-displacement
challenges that unsupervised DIR methods struggle to address. This limitation
occurs because neural networks predict deformation fields in a single forward
pass, leaving fields unconstrained post-training and shifting the
regularization burden entirely to network weights. To address these issues, we
introduce SmoothProper, a plug-and-play neural module enforcing smoothness and
promoting message passing within the network's forward pass. By integrating a
duality-based optimization layer with tailored interaction terms, SmoothProper
efficiently propagates flow signals across spatial locations, enforces
smoothness, and preserves structural consistency. It is model-agnostic,
seamlessly integrates into existing registration frameworks with minimal
parameter overhead, and eliminates regularizer hyperparameter tuning.
Preliminary results on a retinal vessel dataset exhibiting aperture and
large-displacement challenges demonstrate our method reduces registration error
to 1.88 pixels on 2912x2912 images, marking the first unsupervised DIR approach
to effectively address both challenges. The source code will be available at

Motivation: 现有方法在遮挡情况下的手-物体姿态估计效果不佳，主要因为缺乏全局结构感知和推理能力。

Method: 提出目标聚焦掩码策略，结合多尺度特征和符号距离场（SDF）与点云融合，增强遮挡区域的鲁棒性。

Result: 在DexYCB和HO3Dv2基准测试中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: HOMAE通过融合全局上下文与局部几何信息，显著提升了遮挡情况下的姿态估计效果。

Abstract: Hand-object pose estimation from monocular RGB images remains a significant
challenge mainly due to the severe occlusions inherent in hand-object
interactions. Existing methods do not sufficiently explore global structural
perception and reasoning, which limits their effectiveness in handling occluded
hand-object interactions. To address this challenge, we propose an
occlusion-aware hand-object pose estimation method based on masked
autoencoders, termed as HOMAE. Specifically, we propose a target-focused
masking strategy that imposes structured occlusion on regions of hand-object
interaction, encouraging the model to learn context-aware features and reason
about the occluded structures. We further integrate multi-scale features
extracted from the decoder to predict a signed distance field (SDF), capturing
both global context and fine-grained geometry. To enhance geometric perception,
we combine the implicit SDF with an explicit point cloud derived from the SDF,
leveraging the complementary strengths of both representations. This fusion
enables more robust handling of occluded regions by combining the global
context from the SDF with the precise local geometry provided by the point
cloud. Extensive experiments on challenging DexYCB and HO3Dv2 benchmarks
demonstrate that HOMAE achieves state-of-the-art performance in hand-object
pose estimation. We will release our code and model.

Result: 在MLVU、LVBench和LongVideoBench上分别提升9.6%、6.6%和3.9%，超越现有MLLM基线。

Conclusion: 代理系统在解决LVU关键挑战中展现出潜力。

Abstract: Long video understanding (LVU) presents a significant challenge for current
multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) due to the task's inherent complexity
and context window constraint. It is widely assumed that addressing LVU tasks
requires foundation MLLMs with extended context windows, strong visual
perception capabilities, and proficient domain expertise. In this work, we
challenge this common belief by introducing VideoDeepResearch, a novel agentic
framework for long video understanding. Our approach relies solely on a
text-only large reasoning model (LRM) combined with a modular multi-modal
toolkit, including multimodal retrievers and visual perceivers, all of which
are readily available in practice. For each LVU task, the system formulates a
problem-solving strategy through reasoning, while selectively accessing and
utilizing essential video content via tool using. We conduct extensive
experiments on popular LVU benchmarks, including MLVU, Video-MME, and LVBench.
Our results demonstrate that VideoDeepResearch achieves substantial
improvements over existing MLLM baselines, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art by 9.6%, 6.6%, and 3.9% on MLVU (test), LVBench, and
LongVideoBench, respectively. These findings highlight the promise of agentic
systems in overcoming key challenges in LVU problems.

Conclusion: PTQ4VM是视频抠图领域首个系统性的PTQ框架，显著提升了量化模型的性能，为实际应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Video matting is crucial for applications such as film production and virtual
reality, yet deploying its computationally intensive models on
resource-constrained devices presents challenges. Quantization is a key
technique for model compression and acceleration. As an efficient approach,
Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is still in its nascent stages for video
matting, facing significant hurdles in maintaining accuracy and temporal
coherence. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel and general
PTQ framework specifically designed for video matting models, marking, to the
best of our knowledge, the first systematic attempt in this domain. Our
contributions include: (1) A two-stage PTQ strategy that combines
block-reconstruction-based optimization for fast, stable initial quantization
and local dependency capture, followed by a global calibration of quantization
parameters to minimize accuracy loss. (2) A Statistically-Driven Global Affine
Calibration (GAC) method that enables the network to compensate for cumulative
statistical distortions arising from factors such as neglected BN layer
effects, even reducing the error of existing PTQ methods on video matting tasks
up to 20%. (3) An Optical Flow Assistance (OFA) component that leverages
temporal and semantic priors from frames to guide the PTQ process, enhancing
the model's ability to distinguish moving foregrounds in complex scenes and
ultimately achieving near full-precision performance even under ultra-low-bit
quantization. Comprehensive quantitative and visual results show that our
PTQ4VM achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy performance across different
bit-widths compared to the existing quantization methods. We highlight that the
4-bit PTQ4VM even achieves performance close to the full-precision counterpart
while enjoying 8x FLOP savings.

Result: CreatiPoster在图形设计生成方面超越开源和商业系统，并发布10万份无版权多层设计数据集。

Conclusion: CreatiPoster推动了AI辅助图形设计的民主化，支持多种应用场景。

Abstract: Graphic design plays a crucial role in both commercial and personal contexts,
yet creating high-quality, editable, and aesthetically pleasing graphic
compositions remains a time-consuming and skill-intensive task, especially for
beginners. Current AI tools automate parts of the workflow, but struggle to
accurately incorporate user-supplied assets, maintain editability, and achieve
professional visual appeal. Commercial systems, like Canva Magic Design, rely
on vast template libraries, which are impractical for replicate. In this paper,
we introduce CreatiPoster, a framework that generates editable, multi-layer
compositions from optional natural-language instructions or assets. A protocol
model, an RGBA large multimodal model, first produces a JSON specification
detailing every layer (text or asset) with precise layout, hierarchy, content
and style, plus a concise background prompt. A conditional background model
then synthesizes a coherent background conditioned on this rendered foreground
layers. We construct a benchmark with automated metrics for graphic-design
generation and show that CreatiPoster surpasses leading open-source approaches
and proprietary commercial systems. To catalyze further research, we release a
copyright-free corpus of 100,000 multi-layer designs. CreatiPoster supports
diverse applications such as canvas editing, text overlay, responsive resizing,
multilingual adaptation, and animated posters, advancing the democratization of
AI-assisted graphic design. Project homepage:

Motivation: 现有ZSGM方法假设文本偏移与图像偏移在CLIP嵌入空间中完全对齐，导致生成图像质量下降。本文旨在分析偏移不对齐现象并提出改进方案。

Method: 通过实证研究分析CLIP嵌入空间中文本与图像偏移的不对齐现象，并提出迭代细化适应方法（AIR）来优化生成质量。

Result: 在26种实验设置中，AIR方法在定性和定量评估中均达到最优性能。

Conclusion: AIR方法通过关注偏移不对齐问题，显著提升了零样本生成模型在目标域中的图像质量。

Abstract: Zero-shot generative model adaptation (ZSGM) aims to adapt a pre-trained
generator to a target domain using only text guidance and without any samples
from the target domain. Central to recent ZSGM approaches are directional loss
which use the text guidance in the form of aligning the image offset with text
offset in the embedding space of a vision-language model like CLIP. This is
similar to the analogical reasoning in NLP where the offset between one pair of
words is used to identify a missing element in another pair by aligning the
offset between these two pairs. However, a major limitation of existing ZSGM
methods is that the learning objective assumes the complete alignment between
image offset and text offset in the CLIP embedding space, resulting in quality
degrade in generated images. Our work makes two main contributions. Inspired by
the offset misalignment studies in NLP, as our first contribution, we perform
an empirical study to analyze the misalignment between text offset and image
offset in CLIP embedding space for various large publicly available datasets.
Our important finding is that offset misalignment in CLIP embedding space is
correlated with concept distance, i.e., close concepts have a less offset
misalignment. To address the limitations of the current approaches, as our
second contribution, we propose Adaptation with Iterative Refinement (AIR)
which is the first ZSGM approach to focus on improving target domain image
quality based on our new insight on offset misalignment.Qualitative,
quantitative, and user study in 26 experiment setups consistently demonstrate
the proposed AIR approach achieves SOTA performance. Additional experiments are
in Supp.

Result: 在768×1280分辨率下，M4V比基于注意力的方法减少45%的FLOPs，并生成高质量视频。

Conclusion: M4V在降低计算成本的同时，显著提升了文本到视频生成的质量和效率。

Abstract: Text-to-video generation has significantly enriched content creation and
holds the potential to evolve into powerful world simulators. However, modeling
the vast spatiotemporal space remains computationally demanding, particularly
when employing Transformers, which incur quadratic complexity in sequence
processing and thus limit practical applications. Recent advancements in
linear-time sequence modeling, particularly the Mamba architecture, offer a
more efficient alternative. Nevertheless, its plain design limits its direct
applicability to multi-modal and spatiotemporal video generation tasks. To
address these challenges, we introduce M4V, a Multi-Modal Mamba framework for
text-to-video generation. Specifically, we propose a multi-modal diffusion
Mamba (MM-DiM) block that enables seamless integration of multi-modal
information and spatiotemporal modeling through a multi-modal token
re-composition design. As a result, the Mamba blocks in M4V reduce FLOPs by 45%
compared to the attention-based alternative when generating videos at
768$\times$1280 resolution. Additionally, to mitigate the visual quality
degradation in long-context autoregressive generation processes, we introduce a
reward learning strategy that further enhances per-frame visual realism.
Extensive experiments on text-to-video benchmarks demonstrate M4V's ability to
produce high-quality videos while significantly lowering computational costs.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法将视觉序列构建为空间块进行自回归生成，但图像块本质上是并行的，与自回归建模的因果性相矛盾。

Method: 使用嵌套频谱标记化将图像转换为有序频谱标记，按频率从低到高排列，然后以从粗到细的方式自回归生成频谱标记序列。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K上进行了图像重建和自回归生成实验，SpectralAR仅用64个标记和310M参数就达到了3.02 gFID。

Conclusion: SpectralAR通过频谱视角实现了视觉序列的因果性，同时保持了标记效率，无需额外复杂设计。

Abstract: Autoregressive visual generation has garnered increasing attention due to its
scalability and compatibility with other modalities compared with diffusion
models. Most existing methods construct visual sequences as spatial patches for
autoregressive generation. However, image patches are inherently parallel,
contradicting the causal nature of autoregressive modeling. To address this, we
propose a Spectral AutoRegressive (SpectralAR) visual generation framework,
which realizes causality for visual sequences from the spectral perspective.
Specifically, we first transform an image into ordered spectral tokens with
Nested Spectral Tokenization, representing lower to higher frequency
components. We then perform autoregressive generation in a coarse-to-fine
manner with the sequences of spectral tokens. By considering different levels
of detail in images, our SpectralAR achieves both sequence causality and token
efficiency without bells and whistles. We conduct extensive experiments on
ImageNet-1K for image reconstruction and autoregressive generation, and
SpectralAR achieves 3.02 gFID with only 64 tokens and 310M parameters. Project

### [178] [MMMG: A Massive, Multidisciplinary, Multi-Tier Generation Benchmark for Text-to-Image Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10963)
*Yuxuan Luo,Yuhui Yuan,Junwen Chen,Haonan Cai,Ziyi Yue,Yuwei Yang,Fatima Zohra Daha,Ji Li,Zhouhui Lian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了知识图像生成任务及MMMG基准，用于评估图像生成模型的推理能力，发现现有模型表现不佳，并发布了开源基线FLUX-Reason。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识图像对人类文明和学习至关重要，但生成此类图像需要多模态推理能力，现有模型表现不足。

Method: 引入MMMG基准，包含4,456个专家验证的图像-提示对，采用知识图谱表示和MMMG-Score评估生成图像。

Result: 评估16种先进模型发现推理能力不足，GPT-4o得分仅50.20；开源基线FLUX-Reason得分34.45。

Conclusion: MMMG基准揭示了图像生成模型的推理缺陷，FLUX-Reason为未来研究提供了有效基线。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce knowledge image generation as a new task,
alongside the Massive Multi-Discipline Multi-Tier Knowledge-Image Generation
Benchmark (MMMG) to probe the reasoning capability of image generation models.
Knowledge images have been central to human civilization and to the mechanisms
of human learning--a fact underscored by dual-coding theory and the
picture-superiority effect. Generating such images is challenging, demanding
multimodal reasoning that fuses world knowledge with pixel-level grounding into
clear explanatory visuals. To enable comprehensive evaluation, MMMG offers
4,456 expert-validated (knowledge) image-prompt pairs spanning 10 disciplines,
6 educational levels, and diverse knowledge formats such as charts, diagrams,
and mind maps. To eliminate confounding complexity during evaluation, we adopt
a unified Knowledge Graph (KG) representation. Each KG explicitly delineates a
target image's core entities and their dependencies. We further introduce
MMMG-Score to evaluate generated knowledge images. This metric combines factual
fidelity, measured by graph-edit distance between KGs, with visual clarity
assessment. Comprehensive evaluations of 16 state-of-the-art text-to-image
generation models expose serious reasoning deficits--low entity fidelity, weak
relations, and clutter--with GPT-4o achieving an MMMG-Score of only 50.20,
underscoring the benchmark's difficulty. To spur further progress, we release
FLUX-Reason (MMMG-Score of 34.45), an effective and open baseline that combines
a reasoning LLM with diffusion models and is trained on 16,000 curated
knowledge image-prompt pairs.

TL;DR: CDPruner是一种新型视觉令牌修剪方法，通过最大化条件多样性来优化多模态大语言模型的推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉令牌冗余导致的推理成本高问题，现有方法存在重复令牌或忽略指令相关性的缺陷。

Method: 提出基于条件多样性的修剪方法CDPruner，利用DPP最大化令牌子集的多样性。

Result: 在多种MLLMs上实现SOTA性能，显著降低计算开销（如LLaVA的FLOPs减少95%）。

Conclusion: CDPruner通过条件多样性修剪，高效平衡性能与计算成本，适用于多种MLLMs。

Abstract: In multimodal large language models (MLLMs), the length of input visual
tokens is often significantly greater than that of their textual counterparts,
leading to a high inference cost. Many works aim to address this issue by
removing redundant visual tokens. However, current approaches either rely on
attention-based pruning, which retains numerous duplicate tokens, or use
similarity-based pruning, overlooking the instruction relevance, consequently
causing suboptimal performance. In this paper, we go beyond attention or
similarity by proposing a novel visual token pruning method named CDPruner,
which maximizes the conditional diversity of retained tokens. We first define
the conditional similarity between visual tokens conditioned on the
instruction, and then reformulate the token pruning problem with determinantal
point process (DPP) to maximize the conditional diversity of the selected
subset. The proposed CDPruner is training-free and model-agnostic, allowing
easy application to various MLLMs. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLMs
show that CDPruner establishes new state-of-the-art on various vision-language
benchmarks. By maximizing conditional diversity through DPP, the selected
subset better represents the input images while closely adhering to user
instructions, thereby preserving strong performance even with high reduction
ratios. When applied to LLaVA, CDPruner reduces FLOPs by 95\% and CUDA latency
by 78\%, while maintaining 94\% of the original accuracy. Our code is available
at https://github.com/Theia-4869/CDPruner.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出GenWorld数据集和SpannDetector模型，用于检测高质量AI生成视频，填补了真实世界数据集的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI生成视频技术的发展威胁信息可信度，但缺乏高质量真实数据集阻碍检测器发展。

Method: 构建GenWorld数据集，模拟真实场景并采用多种生成模型；提出SpannDetector模型，利用多视角一致性检测。

Result: 实验表明SpannDetector优于现有方法，揭示了基于物理合理性的可解释检测方向。

Conclusion: GenWorld和SpannDetector为AI生成视频检测领域提供了新思路和工具。

Abstract: The flourishing of video generation technologies has endangered the
credibility of real-world information and intensified the demand for
AI-generated video detectors. Despite some progress, the lack of high-quality
real-world datasets hinders the development of trustworthy detectors. In this
paper, we propose GenWorld, a large-scale, high-quality, and real-world
simulation dataset for AI-generated video detection. GenWorld features the
following characteristics: (1) Real-world Simulation: GenWorld focuses on
videos that replicate real-world scenarios, which have a significant impact due
to their realism and potential influence; (2) High Quality: GenWorld employs
multiple state-of-the-art video generation models to provide realistic and
high-quality forged videos; (3) Cross-prompt Diversity: GenWorld includes
videos generated from diverse generators and various prompt modalities (e.g.,
text, image, video), offering the potential to learn more generalizable
forensic features. We analyze existing methods and find they fail to detect
high-quality videos generated by world models (i.e., Cosmos), revealing
potential drawbacks of ignoring real-world clues. To address this, we propose a
simple yet effective model, SpannDetector, to leverage multi-view consistency
as a strong criterion for real-world AI-generated video detection. Experiments
show that our method achieves superior results, highlighting a promising
direction for explainable AI-generated video detection based on physical
plausibility. We believe that GenWorld will advance the field of AI-generated
video detection. Project Page: https://chen-wl20.github.io/GenWorld

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于超二次曲面的高效3D占用预测方法QuadricFormer，通过几何多样性和概率混合模型提升建模效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在3D占用预测中效率低下，无法准确建模复杂几何结构。

Method: 使用超二次曲面作为场景基元，开发概率超二次曲面混合模型，并提出QuadricFormer模型及剪枝-分裂模块。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上实现最优性能，同时保持高效。

Conclusion: QuadricFormer通过几何表达性和高效建模，显著提升了3D占用预测的性能和效率。

Abstract: 3D occupancy prediction is crucial for robust autonomous driving systems as
it enables comprehensive perception of environmental structures and semantics.
Most existing methods employ dense voxel-based scene representations, ignoring
the sparsity of driving scenes and resulting in inefficiency. Recent works
explore object-centric representations based on sparse Gaussians, but their
ellipsoidal shape prior limits the modeling of diverse structures. In
real-world driving scenes, objects exhibit rich geometries (e.g., cuboids,
cylinders, and irregular shapes), necessitating excessive ellipsoidal Gaussians
densely packed for accurate modeling, which leads to inefficient
representations. To address this, we propose to use geometrically expressive
superquadrics as scene primitives, enabling efficient representation of complex
structures with fewer primitives through their inherent shape diversity. We
develop a probabilistic superquadric mixture model, which interprets each
superquadric as an occupancy probability distribution with a corresponding
geometry prior, and calculates semantics through probabilistic mixture.
Building on this, we present QuadricFormer, a superquadric-based model for
efficient 3D occupancy prediction, and introduce a pruning-and-splitting module
to further enhance modeling efficiency by concentrating superquadrics in
occupied regions. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate
that QuadricFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining
superior efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为HeadHunter的系统框架，用于在扩散模型中精细控制注意力头的扰动，以优化生成质量和视觉属性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有注意力扰动方法缺乏确定扰动位置的原则性方法，尤其是在DiT架构中，质量相关计算分布在多层中。

Method: 研究了注意力扰动的粒度，从层级到单个注意力头，提出HeadHunter框架和SoftPAG方法，通过线性插值调整扰动强度。

Result: 在Stable Diffusion 3和FLUX.1等模型上验证，展示了在生成质量提升和风格特定引导方面的优越性能。

Conclusion: 首次在扩散模型中进行了头级注意力扰动分析，揭示了注意力层的可解释性分工，为有效扰动策略的设计提供了实用方法。

Abstract: Recent guidance methods in diffusion models steer reverse sampling by
perturbing the model to construct an implicit weak model and guide generation
away from it. Among these approaches, attention perturbation has demonstrated
strong empirical performance in unconditional scenarios where classifier-free
guidance is not applicable. However, existing attention perturbation methods
lack principled approaches for determining where perturbations should be
applied, particularly in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architectures where
quality-relevant computations are distributed across layers. In this paper, we
investigate the granularity of attention perturbations, ranging from the layer
level down to individual attention heads, and discover that specific heads
govern distinct visual concepts such as structure, style, and texture quality.
Building on this insight, we propose "HeadHunter", a systematic framework for
iteratively selecting attention heads that align with user-centric objectives,
enabling fine-grained control over generation quality and visual attributes. In
addition, we introduce SoftPAG, which linearly interpolates each selected
head's attention map toward an identity matrix, providing a continuous knob to
tune perturbation strength and suppress artifacts. Our approach not only
mitigates the oversmoothing issues of existing layer-level perturbation but
also enables targeted manipulation of specific visual styles through
compositional head selection. We validate our method on modern large-scale
DiT-based text-to-image models including Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX.1,
demonstrating superior performance in both general quality enhancement and
style-specific guidance. Our work provides the first head-level analysis of
attention perturbation in diffusion models, uncovering interpretable
specialization within attention layers and enabling practical design of
effective perturbation strategies.

TL;DR: InstaInpaint是一种基于参考的前馈框架，能在0.4秒内完成3D场景修复，速度提升1000倍，同时保持高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D场景修复方法依赖耗时计算，无法满足实时或在线应用需求。

Method: 提出自监督掩码微调策略，训练定制化大型重建模型（LRM），并通过关键设计提升泛化性、纹理一致性和几何正确性。

Result: 在两大标准基准测试中保持最优性能，并适用于对象插入和多区域修复等下游任务。

Conclusion: InstaInpaint在速度和性能上均显著优于现有方法，适用于实时应用。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D scene reconstruction enable real-time viewing in
virtual and augmented reality. To support interactive operations for better
immersiveness, such as moving or editing objects, 3D scene inpainting methods
are proposed to repair or complete the altered geometry. However, current
approaches rely on lengthy and computationally intensive optimization, making
them impractical for real-time or online applications. We propose InstaInpaint,
a reference-based feed-forward framework that produces 3D-scene inpainting from
a 2D inpainting proposal within 0.4 seconds. We develop a self-supervised
masked-finetuning strategy to enable training of our custom large
reconstruction model (LRM) on the large-scale dataset. Through extensive
experiments, we analyze and identify several key designs that improve
generalization, textural consistency, and geometric correctness. InstaInpaint
achieves a 1000x speed-up from prior methods while maintaining a
state-of-the-art performance across two standard benchmarks. Moreover, we show
that InstaInpaint generalizes well to flexible downstream applications such as
object insertion and multi-region inpainting. More video results are available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成模型在新视角合成中依赖2D补全和3D恢复的分离流程，导致几何失真和表面平滑问题。

Method: 提出SceneCompleter框架，包含几何-外观双流扩散模型和场景编码器，联合合成RGBD空间的新视角。

Result: 方法在多样数据集上展示了更高的视觉一致性和几何合理性。

Conclusion: SceneCompleter通过融合结构和纹理信息，实现了更优的生成式新视角合成效果。

Abstract: Generative models have gained significant attention in novel view synthesis
(NVS) by alleviating the reliance on dense multi-view captures. However,
existing methods typically fall into a conventional paradigm, where generative
models first complete missing areas in 2D, followed by 3D recovery techniques
to reconstruct the scene, which often results in overly smooth surfaces and
distorted geometry, as generative models struggle to infer 3D structure solely
from RGB data. In this paper, we propose SceneCompleter, a novel framework that
achieves 3D-consistent generative novel view synthesis through dense 3D scene
completion. SceneCompleter achieves both visual coherence and 3D-consistent
generative scene completion through two key components: (1) a
geometry-appearance dual-stream diffusion model that jointly synthesizes novel
views in RGBD space; (2) a scene embedder that encodes a more holistic scene
understanding from the reference image. By effectively fusing structural and
textural information, our method demonstrates superior coherence and
plausibility in generative novel view synthesis across diverse datasets.

Motivation: 探索观众集体行为如何影响表演，以及这种互动中代理行为、体验与权力之间的复杂关系。

Method: 观众在表演关键时刻投票决定机器人行为，表演后通过调查和数据收集分析观众感受与实际影响。

Result: 观众感觉自己的选择有意义，但投票数据表明行为模式高度一致。

Conclusion: 表演揭示了代理行为与体验之间的张力，为算法化数字系统中代理感的类似现象提供了现场类比。

Abstract: We describe DANCE^2, an interactive dance performance in which audience
members channel their collective agency into a dancer-robot duet by voting on
the behavior of a wearable robot affixed to the dancer's body. At key moments
during the performance, the audience is invited to either continue the
choreography or override it, shaping the unfolding interaction through
real-time collective input. While post-performance surveys revealed that
participants felt their choices meaningfully influenced the performance, voting
data across four public performances exhibited strikingly consistent patterns.
This tension between what audience members do, what they feel, and what
actually changes highlights a complex interplay between agentive behavior, the
experience of agency, and power. We reflect on how choreography, interaction
design, and the structure of the performance mediate this relationship,
offering a live analogy for algorithmically curated digital systems where
agency is felt, but not exercised.

Abstract: Developing literacy with unfamiliar data visualization techniques such as
Parallel Coordinate Plots (PCPs) can be a significant challenge for students.
We adopted the Revised Bloom's taxonomy to instruct students on Parallel
Coordinate Plots (PCPs) using Mastery Learning in the classroom. To evaluate
Mastery Learning's impact, we conducted an intervention in a Data Visualization
course to teach students about PCPs using the Revised Bloom's taxonomy with and
without Mastery Learning. Based on our intervention, we found that while
students in both groups performed similarly on the first two (Remember,
Understand) modules, the students in the Mastery Learning group performed
better on modules that required more advanced thinking (Analyze, Evaluate) and
demonstrated a better comprehension of PCPs. We provide all the materials
developed including the six-module Bloom's Taxonomy PCP literacy (BTPL) test

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AI在移民家庭中的使用，关注代际、语言和文化挑战，挑战传统的技能导向AI素养模型。

Method: 通过对20个韩国移民家庭的半结构化访谈，分析父母和青少年对AI工具的使用实践。

Result: 发现两种关键实践：父母的解释性把关和青少年的便利性批判延迟，表明AI素养是动态的家庭共建过程。

Conclusion: 为信息科学和人机交互提供了新的AI素养概念扩展，并提出了更公平、文化敏感的家庭中心AI系统设计建议。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes deeply integrated into family life,
immigrant families must navigate unique intergenerational, linguistic, and
cultural challenges. This study examines how Korean immigrant families in the
United States negotiate the use of AI tools such as ChatGPT and smart
assistants in their homes. Through 20 semi-structured interviews with parents
and teens, we identify two key practices that shape their engagement:
interpretive gatekeeping, where parents mediate their children's AI use through
a lens of cultural and ethical values, and convenient critical deferment, where
teens strategically postpone critical evaluation of AI for immediate academic
and social utility. These intertwined practices challenge conventional,
skills-based models of AI literacy, revealing it instead as a dynamic and
relational practice co-constructed through ongoing family negotiation. We
contribute to information science and HCI by offering a new conceptual
extension for intergenerational AI literacy and providing design implications
for more equitable, culturally attuned, and family-centered AI systems.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence holds significant potential to enhance human
creativity. However, achieving this vision requires a clearer understanding of
how such enhancement can be effectively realized. Adopting the perspective of
distributed creativity, we identify three primary modes through which AI can
contribute to creative processes: Support, where AI acts as a tool; Synergy,
where AI and humans collaborate in complementary ways; and Symbiosis, where
human and AI cognition become so integrated that they form a unified creative
system. These modes are defined along two key dimensions: the level of
technical autonomy exhibited by the AI system and the degree of perceived
agency attributed to it. We examine how each configuration influences different
levels of creativity - from everyday problem-solving to paradigm-shifting
innovation - and discuss the theoretical, ethical, and design implications.

Abstract: This paper proposes a shift from compliance-centered web accessibility to a
care-driven model that prioritizes user autonomy, using neurodivergent users as
a catalyst case for broader personalization needs. While accessibility
standards offer a flexible framework, they are often interpreted and
implemented as static compliance checklists, our approach reframes it as a
flexible, user-centered process. We introduce a customizable Comfort Mode
framework that allows users to adapt interface settings, such as contrast,
typography, motion, and scaling, according to their individual needs, while
retaining the brand's core visual identity. Grounded in psychological and
cognitive accessibility principles, our design supports personalization without
sacrificing creative freedom. We present both minimal and advanced
implementation models with mock-ups, demonstrating how inclusive design can be
seamlessly integrated at minimal cost. This approach aims to broaden digital
inclusivity by offering autonomy to those who require it, without imposing
changes on those who do not. The proposed system is adaptable, scalable, and
suitable for a wide range of users and brands, offering a new paradigm where
user autonomy, aesthetic integrity, and accessibility converge not through
compromise, but through choice.

Result: 在文章撰写和可视化生成场景中验证，IDEA能产生更优设计结果。

Conclusion: IDEA展示了跨领域适应性和高效设计能力。

Abstract: Design spaces serve as a conceptual framework that enables designers to
explore feasible solutions through the selection and combination of design
elements. However, effective decision-making remains heavily dependent on the
designer's experience, and the absence of mathematical formalization prevents
computational support for automated design processes. To bridge this gap, we
introduce a structured representation that models design spaces with orthogonal
dimensions and discrete selectable elements. Building on this model, we present
IDEA, a decision-making framework for augmenting design intelligence through
design space exploration to generate effective outcomes. Specifically, IDEA
leverages large language models (LLMs) for constraint generation, incorporates
a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm guided by these constraints to
explore the design space efficiently, and instantiates abstract decisions into
domain-specific implementations. We validate IDEA in two design scenarios:
data-driven article composition and pictorial visualization generation,
supported by example results, expert interviews, and a user study. The
evaluation demonstrates the IDEA's adaptability across domains and its
capability to produce superior design outcomes.

Motivation: 了解IDE界面设计对ADHD学生的影响，填补相关研究空白。

Method: 采用"大声思考"实验和定性访谈，分析学生对Visual Studio Code的使用体验。

Result: 发现三个主题：自信心、互动和学习，当前IDE设计导致学生挫败感。

Conclusion: 需改进IDE设计，以提升ADHD学生的可用性和学习体验。

Abstract: Coding forms a key part of computer science education in universities. As
part of this education, Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are
essential tools for coding. However, it is currently unknown how the design of
an IDE's interface impacts on students with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity
Disorder (ADHD).
  In this study we investigated the use of IDEs by students with ADHD. We
conducted a think aloud study with nine university computing students, followed
by qualitative observational interviews to analyse their learning and
engagement with the Visual Studio Code IDE. The paper reports on these
experiences and seeks to understand the role IDEs play in the educational
setting.
  Our work also examines how digital accessibility and usability are considered
in the current design of IDEs. We analysed the qualitative data using a
thematic analysis and identified three primary themes: self-confidence,
interaction, and learning as well as various sub-themes.
  The themes and their sub-themes illustrate key areas of consideration when
designing IDEs for students with ADHD. The primary findings highlight
experiences of frustration and barriers in the current design and layout of
IDEs.
  Through our participatory approach we provide a rare insight into ADHD user
experiences around usability and accessibility, and describe the need for
better design of development environments to ensure a positive learning
experience for the students.

Abstract: Text animation, a foundational element in video creation, enables efficient
and cost-effective communication, thriving in advertisements, journalism, and
social media. However, traditional animation workflows present significant
usability barriers for non-professionals, with intricate operational procedures
severely hindering creative productivity. To address this, we propose a Large
Language Model (LLM)-aided text animation editing system that enables real-time
intent tracking and flexible editing. The system introduces an agent-based
dual-stream pipeline that integrates context-aware inline suggestions and
conversational guidance as well as employs a semantic-animation mapping to
facilitate LLM-driven creative intent translation. Besides, the system supports
synchronized text-animation previews and parametric adjustments via unified
controls to improve editing workflow. A user study evaluates the system,
highlighting its ability to help non-professional users complete animation
workflows while validating the pipeline. The findings encourage further
exploration of integrating LLMs into a comprehensive video creation workflow.

Motivation: 预测用户意图抓取的物体可为交互环境提供关键上下文信息，并缓解点对点延迟的影响。

Method: 通过记录16名参与者在抓取真实和合成物体时的手部运动数据，使用简单的LSTM网络进行分析。

Result: LSTM网络能预测抓取时间（精度优于21毫秒）和距离（精度优于1厘米），目标大小预测准确率超过97%。

Conclusion: 研究结果为设计自适应、细粒度的交互用户界面提供了重要依据，适用于普适和混合现实环境。

Abstract: The ability to predict the object the user intends to grasp offers essential
contextual information and may help to leverage the effects of point-to-point
latency in interactive environments. This paper explores the feasibility and
accuracy of real-time recognition of uninstrumented objects based on hand
kinematics during reach-to-grasp actions. In a data collection study, we
recorded the hand motions of 16 participants while reaching out to grasp and
then moving real and synthetic objects. Our results demonstrate that even a
simple LSTM network can predict the time point at which the user grasps an
object with a precision better than 21 ms and the current distance to this
object with a precision better than 1 cm. The target's size can be determined
in advance with an accuracy better than 97%. Our results have implications for
designing adaptive and fine-grained interactive user interfaces in ubiquitous
and mixed-reality environments.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种记录手工艺实践中即兴行为的基本语法，并通过CraftLink界面验证其有效性，旨在促进知识共享。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统手工艺知识记录过于线性，忽略了即兴和适应性的隐性知识，限制了知识的传播和手工艺的深度理解。

Method: 结合专家访谈和多学科文献，开发了一种记录即兴行为的基本语法，并通过CraftLink界面分析专家视频，生成半自动文档。

Result: 用户研究（N=7）表明，该语法能有效捕捉和分享专家知识，为计算系统支持社区知识共享提供了新途径。

Conclusion: 该研究为手工艺知识的系统性记录和共享提供了新方法，强调了隐性知识的重要性。

Abstract: Craft practices rely on evolving archives of skill and knowledge, developed
through generations of craftspeople experimenting with designs, materials, and
techniques. Better documentation of these practices enables the sharing of
knowledge and expertise between sites and generations. However, most
documentation focuses solely on the linear steps leading to final artifacts,
neglecting the tacit knowledge necessary to improvise, or adapt workflows to
meet the unique demands of each craft project. This omission limits knowledge
sharing and reduces craft to a mechanical endeavor, rather than a sophisticated
way of seeing, thinking, and doing. Drawing on expert interviews and literature
from HCI, CSCW and the social sciences, we develop an elementary grammar to
document improvisational actions of real-world craft practices. We demonstrate
the utility of this grammar with an interface called CraftLink that can be used
to analyze expert videos and semi-automatically generate documentation to
convey material and contextual variations of craft practices. Our user study
with expert crocheters (N=7) using this interface evaluates our grammar's
effectiveness in capturing and sharing expert knowledge with other
craftspeople, offering new pathways for computational systems to support
collaborative archives of knowledge and practice within communities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交连接的减少对心理健康和幸福感构成威胁，而GAI技术在社交应用中的影响尚不明确，因此需要系统研究。

Method: 通过分析2020年以来的30项研究，总结了GAI应用的设计领域、目标社交形式及设计评估方法。

Result: 研究发现GAI在故事讲述、情感技能训练等领域有潜力，但需关注文化偏见和可访问性等社会伦理问题。

Conclusion: GAI支持动态个性化互动，但需更注重公平设计和包容性评估策略。

Abstract: Reduced social connectedness increasingly poses a threat to mental health,
life expectancy, and general well-being. Generative AI (GAI) technologies, such
as large language models (LLMs) and image generation tools, are increasingly
integrated into applications aimed at enhancing human social experiences.
Despite their growing presence, little is known about how these technologies
influence social interactions. This scoping review investigates how GAI-based
applications are currently designed to facilitate social interaction, what
forms of social engagement they target, and which design and evaluation
methodologies designers use to create and evaluate them. Through an analysis of
30 studies published since 2020, we identify key trends in application domains
including storytelling, socio-emotional skills training, reminiscence,
collaborative learning, music making, and general conversation. We highlight
the role of participatory and co-design approaches in fostering both effective
technology use and social engagement, while also examining socio-ethical
concerns such as cultural bias and accessibility. This review underscores the
potential of GAI to support dynamic and personalized interactions, but calls
for greater attention to equitable design practices and inclusive evaluation
strategies.

Result: 情感表达通过语言和视觉渠道多样化呈现，视觉元素的精心设计能提升观众互动。

Conclusion: 未来需开展大规模定量研究，探索视觉特征如何影响社交媒体视频传播，以支持患者管理疾病体验。

Abstract: Individuals with schizophrenia frequently experience intense emotions and
often turn to vlogging as a medium for emotional expression. While previous
research has predominantly focused on text based disclosure, little is known
about how individuals construct narratives around emotions and emotional
experiences in video blogs. Our study addresses this gap by analyzing 200
YouTube videos created by individuals with schizophrenia. Drawing on media
research and self presentation theories, we developed a visual analysis
framework to disentangle these videos. Our analysis revealed diverse practices
of emotion disclosure through both verbal and visual channels, highlighting the
dynamic interplay between these modes of expression. We found that the
deliberate construction of visual elements, including environmental settings
and specific aesthetic choices, appears to foster more supportive and engaged
viewer responses. These findings underscore the need for future large scale
quantitative research examining how visual features shape video mediated
communication on social media platforms. Such investigations would inform the
development of care centered video sharing platforms that better support
individuals managing illness experiences.

Conclusion: 该研究为减少目标被试数据需求的高性能SSVEP-BCI提供了潜在解决方案。

Abstract: Steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)-based brain-computer interfaces
(BCIs) can achieve high recognition accuracy with sufficient training data.
Transfer learning presents a promising solution to alleviate data requirements
for the target subject by leveraging data from source subjects; however,
effectively addressing individual variability among both target and source
subjects remains a challenge. This paper proposes a novel transfer learning
framework, termed instance-based task-related component analysis (iTRCA), which
leverages knowledge from source subjects while considering their individual
contributions. iTRCA extracts two types of features: (1) the subject-general
feature, capturing shared information between source and target subjects in a
common latent space, and (2) the subject-specific feature, preserving the
unique characteristics of the target subject. To mitigate negative transfer, we
further design an enhanced framework, subject selection-based iTRCA (SS-iTRCA),
which integrates a similarity-based subject selection strategy to identify
appropriate source subjects for transfer based on their task-related components
(TRCs). Comparative evaluations on the Benchmark, BETA, and a self-collected
dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed iTRCA and SS-iTRCA
frameworks. This study provides a potential solution for developing
high-performance SSVEP-based BCIs with reduced target subject data.

Result: 在三个多模态数据集上的实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 本文方法在多模态增量学习中表现出色，解决了信息整合和遗忘问题。

Abstract: Unlike traditional Multimodal Class-Incremental Learning (MCIL) methods that
focus only on vision and text, this paper explores MCIL across vision, audio
and text modalities, addressing challenges in integrating complementary
information and mitigating catastrophic forgetting. To tackle these issues, we
propose an MCIL method based on multimodal pre-trained models. Firstly, a
Multimodal Incremental Feature Extractor (MIFE) based on Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) structure is introduced to achieve effective incremental fine-tuning for
AudioCLIP. Secondly, to enhance feature discriminability and generalization, we
propose an Adaptive Audio-Visual Fusion Module (AAVFM) that includes a masking
threshold mechanism and a dynamic feature fusion mechanism, along with a
strategy to enhance text diversity. Thirdly, a novel multimodal
class-incremental contrastive training loss is proposed to optimize cross-modal
alignment in MCIL. Finally, two MCIL-specific evaluation metrics are introduced
for comprehensive assessment. Extensive experiments on three multimodal
datasets validate the effectiveness of our method.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为NOCL的新框架，通过节点描述和节点概念技术，将LLM应用于非文本属性图，并显著减少输入长度，同时统一多级图任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图神经网络依赖监督学习，自监督方法仍需标签微调，而LLM在图上应用面临挑战。NOCL旨在解决这些问题。

Method: NOCL采用节点描述将异构属性转为自然语言，节点概念压缩语义嵌入，并使用图表示描述符统一任务格式。

Result: 实验表明NOCL在监督学习中表现优异，且在零样本场景下泛化能力更强。

Conclusion: NOCL为图基础模型提供了新方向，解决了LLM在图上的应用限制。

Abstract: Graphs are essential for modeling complex interactions across domains such as
social networks, biology, and recommendation systems. Traditional Graph Neural
Networks, particularly Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs), rely heavily on
supervised learning, limiting their generalization and applicability in
label-scarce scenarios. Recent self-supervised approaches still require labeled
fine-tuning, limiting their effectiveness in zero-shot scenarios. Meanwhile,
Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in natural language tasks but face
significant challenges when applied to graphs, including preserving reasoning
abilities, managing extensive token lengths from rich node attributes, and
being limited to textual-attributed graphs (TAGs) and a single level task. To
overcome these limitations, we propose the Node-Oriented Conceptualization LLM
(NOCL), a novel framework that leverages two core techniques: 1) node
description, which converts heterogeneous node attributes into structured
natural language, extending LLM from TAGs to non-TAGs; 2) node concept, which
encodes node descriptions into compact semantic embeddings using pretrained
language models, significantly reducing token lengths by up to 93.9% compared
to directly using node descriptions. Additionally, our NOCL employs graph
representation descriptors to unify graph tasks at various levels into a
shared, language-based query format, paving a new direction for Graph
Foundation Models. Experimental results validate NOCL's competitive supervised
performance relative to traditional MPNNs and hybrid LLM-MPNN methods and
demonstrate superior generalization in zero-shot settings.

Motivation: 传统逆向设计方法耗时且计算量大，深度学习可提高效率。

Method: 采用串联神经网络（TNN），结合MLP、CNN和LSTM算法，解决一对多映射问题。

Result: LSTM-LSTM-TNN精度最高但训练时间最长，CNN-LSTM-TNN在精度和速度上表现最优。

Conclusion: CNN-LSTM-TNN是光学逆向设计中的理想解决方案，兼具高效和准确。

Abstract: Optical properties of thin film are greatly influenced by the thickness of
each layer. Accurately predicting these thicknesses and their corresponding
optical properties is important in the optical inverse design of thin films.
However, traditional inverse design methods usually demand extensive numerical
simulations and optimization procedures, which are time-consuming. In this
paper, we utilize deep learning for the inverse design of the transmission
spectra of SiO2/TiO2 multilayer thin films. We implement a tandem neural
network (TNN), which can solve the one-to-many mapping problem that greatly
degrades the performance of deep-learning-based inverse designs. In general,
the TNN has been implemented by a back-to-back connection of an inverse neural
network and a pre-trained forward neural network, both of which have been
implemented based on multilayer perceptron (MLP) algorithms. In this paper, we
propose to use not only MLP, but also convolutional neural network (CNN) or
long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithms in the configuration of the TNN. We
show that an LSTM-LSTM-based TNN yields the highest accuracy but takes the
longest training time among nine configurations of TNNs. We also find that a
CNN-LSTM-based TNN will be an optimal solution in terms of accuracy and speed
because it could integrate the strengths of the CNN and LSTM algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DPO方法忽视偏好对的固有质量和学习效用差异，导致数据利用和性能不佳。

Method: 提出Omni-DPO框架，联合考虑偏好对的固有质量和模型学习动态，动态加权样本。

Result: 在文本理解和数学推理任务中，Omni-DPO显著优于基线方法，如Gemma-2-9b-it在Arena-Hard上超越Claude 3 Opus 6.7分。

Conclusion: Omni-DPO通过动态加权策略，有效提升了数据利用和模型性能，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a cornerstone of
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) due to its simplicity and
efficiency. However, existing DPO-based approaches typically treat all
preference pairs uniformly, ignoring critical variations in their inherent
quality and learning utility, leading to suboptimal data utilization and
performance. To address this challenge, we propose Omni-DPO, a dual-perspective
optimization framework that jointly accounts for (1) the inherent quality of
each preference pair and (2) the model's evolving performance on those pairs.
By adaptively weighting samples according to both data quality and the model's
learning dynamics during training, Omni-DPO enables more effective training
data utilization and achieves better performance. Experimental results on
various models and benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and generalization
capabilities of Omni-DPO. On textual understanding tasks, Gemma-2-9b-it
finetuned with Omni-DPO beats the leading LLM, Claude 3 Opus, by a significant
margin of 6.7 points on the Arena-Hard benchmark. On mathematical reasoning
tasks, Omni-DPO consistently outperforms the baseline methods across all
benchmarks, providing strong empirical evidence for the effectiveness and
robustness of our approach. Code and models will be available at

Motivation: 尽管LLM在解决复杂任务上表现出色，但其不确定性的量化仍是一个关键问题，限制了其在高风险领域的应用。此外，LLM对提示的敏感性及封闭性进一步增加了挑战。

Method: 通过贝叶斯视角将提示视为文本参数，利用小规模训练数据进行贝叶斯推断，并提出了MHLP算法（结合提示优化与标准MCMC方法）。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在预测准确性和不确定性量化方面均有提升，适用于多种LLM基准和UQ任务。

Conclusion: 研究为将贝叶斯方法融入LLM提供了可行路径，有助于构建更可靠和校准的LLM系统。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly capable of
solving challenging real-world tasks, accurately quantifying their uncertainty
remains a critical open problem, which limits their applicability in
high-stakes domains. This challenge is further compounded by the closed-source,
black-box nature of many state-of-the-art LLMs. Moreover, LLM-based systems can
be highly sensitive to the prompts that bind them together, which often require
significant manual tuning (i.e., prompt engineering). In this work, we address
these challenges by viewing LLM-based systems through a Bayesian lens. We
interpret prompts as textual parameters in a statistical model, allowing us to
use a small training dataset to perform Bayesian inference over these prompts.
This novel perspective enables principled uncertainty quantification over both
the model's textual parameters and its downstream predictions, while also
incorporating prior beliefs about these parameters expressed in free-form text.
To perform Bayesian inference, a difficult problem even for well-studied data
modalities, we introduce Metropolis-Hastings through LLM Proposals (MHLP), a
novel Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that combines prompt
optimization techniques with standard MCMC methods. MHLP is a turnkey
modification to existing LLM pipelines, including those that rely exclusively
on closed-source models. Empirically, we demonstrate that our method yields
improvements in both predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification (UQ) on
a range of LLM benchmarks and UQ tasks. More broadly, our work demonstrates a
viable path for incorporating methods from the rich Bayesian literature into
the era of LLMs, paving the way for more reliable and calibrated LLM-based
systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于信息理论的框架，用于优化分层变分自编码器（HVAE）中潜在维度的分配，以提高分布外（OOD）检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在安全关键应用中，OOD检测至关重要，但现有HVAE方法因潜在维度分配不当导致性能不佳。

Method: 通过信息理论原则，形式化信息损失与表示衰减的权衡，提出最优潜在维度分配比例$r^{\ast}$。

Result: 实验表明，调整该比例显著提升了OOD检测性能，优于基线HVAE配置。

Conclusion: 该框架为潜在结构设计提供了理论指导，增强了深度生成模型的OOD检测鲁棒性。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is a critical task in machine learning,
particularly for safety-critical applications where unexpected inputs must be
reliably flagged. While hierarchical variational autoencoders (HVAEs) offer
improved representational capacity over traditional VAEs, their performance is
highly sensitive to how latent dimensions are distributed across layers.
Existing approaches often allocate latent capacity arbitrarily, leading to
ineffective representations or posterior collapse. In this work, we introduce a
theoretically grounded framework for optimizing latent dimension allocation in
HVAEs, drawing on principles from information theory to formalize the trade-off
between information loss and representational attenuation. We prove the
existence of an optimal allocation ratio $r^{\ast}$ under a fixed latent
budget, and empirically show that tuning this ratio consistently improves OOD
detection performance across datasets and architectures. Our approach
outperforms baseline HVAE configurations and provides practical guidance for
principled latent structure design, leading to more robust OOD detection with
deep generative models.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We consider a kernelized bandit problem with a compact arm set ${X} \subset
\mathbb{R}^d $ and a fixed but unknown reward function $f^*$ with a finite norm
in some Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). We propose a class of
computationally efficient kernelized bandit algorithms, which we call
GP-Generic, based on a novel concept: exploration distributions. This class of
algorithms includes Upper Confidence Bound-based approaches as a special case,
but also allows for a variety of randomized algorithms. With careful choice of
exploration distribution, our proposed generic algorithm realizes a wide range
of concrete algorithms that achieve $\tilde{O}(\gamma_T\sqrt{T})$ regret
bounds, where $\gamma_T$ characterizes the RKHS complexity. This matches known
results for UCB- and Thompson Sampling-based algorithms; we also show that in
practice, randomization can yield better practical results.

Conclusion: 该方法为大规模图像聚类应用提供了可靠的无监督表示学习基础，兼具可解释性和可扩展性。

Abstract: This research implements an advanced unsupervised clustering system for MNIST
handwritten digits through two-phase deep autoencoder architecture. A deep
neural autoencoder requires a training process during phase one to develop
minimal yet interpretive representations of images by minimizing reconstruction
errors. During the second phase we unify the reconstruction error with a KMeans
clustering loss for learned latent embeddings through a joint distance-based
objective. Our model contains three elements which include batch normalization
combined with dropout and weight decay for achieving generalized and stable
results. The framework achieves superior clustering performance during
extensive tests which used intrinsic measurements including Silhouette Score
and Davies-Bouldin Index coupled with extrinsic metrics NMI and ARI when
processing image features. The research uses t-SNE visualization to present
learned embeddings that show distinct clusters for digits. Our approach reaches
an optimal combination between data reconstruction accuracy and cluster
separation purity when adding the benefit of understandable results and
scalable implementations. The approach creates a dependable base that helps
deploy unsupervised representation learning in different large-scale image
clustering applications.

Abstract: We present a novel federated multi-task learning method that leverages
cross-client similarity to enable personalized learning for each client. To
avoid transmitting the entire model to the parameter server, we propose a
communication-efficient scheme that introduces a feature anchor, a compact
vector representation that summarizes the features learned from the client's
local classes. This feature anchor is shared with the server to account for
local clients' distribution. In addition, the clients share the classification
heads, a lightweight linear layer, and perform a graph-based regularization to
enable collaboration among clients. By modeling collaboration between clients
as a dynamic graph and continuously updating and refining this graph, we can
account for any drift from the clients. To ensure beneficial knowledge transfer
and prevent negative collaboration, we leverage a community detection-based
approach that partitions this dynamic graph into homogeneous communities,
maximizing the sum of task similarities, represented as the graph edges'
weights, within each community. This mechanism restricts collaboration to
highly similar clients within their formed communities, ensuring positive
interaction and preserving personalization. Extensive experiments on two
heterogeneous datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, we show that our method exhibits
superior computation and communication efficiency and promotes fairness across
clients.

deficits such as dysarthria, without the need for high-risk surgical
interventions. The ultimate aim of the 2025 PNPL competition is to produce the
conditions for an "ImageNet moment" or breakthrough in non-invasive neural
decoding, by harnessing the collective power of the machine learning community.
  To facilitate this vision we present the largest within-subject MEG dataset
recorded to date (LibriBrain) together with a user-friendly Python library
(pnpl) for easy data access and integration with deep learning frameworks. For
the competition we define two foundational tasks (i.e. Speech Detection and
Phoneme Classification from brain data), complete with standardised data splits
and evaluation metrics, illustrative benchmark models, online tutorial code, a
community discussion board, and public leaderboard for submissions. To promote
accessibility and participation the competition features a Standard track that
emphasises algorithmic innovation, as well as an Extended track that is
expected to reward larger-scale computing, accelerating progress toward a
non-invasive brain-computer interface for speech.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种非负扩散（NnD）方法，用于高效生成和推断非负物理对象（如3D云），显著降低了计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然对象通常复杂且多变，传统模拟方法计算成本高，难以扩展。

Method: 采用基于分数的扩散生成模型，结合退火Langevin动力学，确保生成过程中的非负性。

Result: 生成的3D云符合物理趋势，专家难以区分其与真实云的差异。

Conclusion: NnD方法在保持物理意义的同时，显著提升了计算效率。

Abstract: Most natural objects have inherent complexity and variability. While some
simple objects can be modeled from first principles, many real-world phenomena,
such as cloud formation, require computationally expensive simulations that
limit scalability. This work focuses on a class of physically meaningful,
nonnegative objects that are computationally tractable but costly to simulate.
To dramatically reduce computational costs, we propose nonnegative diffusion
(NnD). This is a learned generative model using score based diffusion. It
adapts annealed Langevin dynamics to enforce, by design, non-negativity
throughout iterative scene generation and analysis (inference). NnD trains on
high-quality physically simulated objects. Once trained, it can be used for
generation and inference. We demonstrate generation of 3D volumetric clouds,
comprising inherently nonnegative microphysical fields. Our generated clouds
are consistent with cloud physics trends. They are effectively not
distinguished as non-physical by expert perception.

TL;DR: GRAIL是一个新的基准框架，用于评估动态环境中基于图的主动学习方法，引入多样性、用户负担等新指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于图的主动学习方法主要关注静态数据集和预测准确性，忽视了用户中心因素和动态环境适应性。

Method: 提出GRAIL框架，引入新指标评估持续有效性、多样性和用户负担，并在动态真实数据集上进行实验。

Result: 实验揭示了预测性能和用户负担之间的权衡，展示了现有方法的局限性。

Conclusion: GRAIL强调了平衡节点重要性、查询多样性和网络拓扑的重要性，为动态环境中的图主动学习提供了评估机制。

Abstract: Graph-based Active Learning (AL) leverages the structure of graphs to
efficiently prioritize label queries, reducing labeling costs and user burden
in applications like health monitoring, human behavior analysis, and sensor
networks. By identifying strategically positioned nodes, graph AL minimizes
data collection demands while maintaining model performance, making it a
valuable tool for dynamic environments. Despite its potential, existing graph
AL methods are often evaluated on static graph datasets and primarily focus on
prediction accuracy, neglecting user-centric considerations such as sampling
diversity, query fairness, and adaptability to dynamic settings. To bridge this
gap, we introduce GRAIL, a novel benchmarking framework designed to evaluate
graph AL strategies in dynamic, real-world environments. GRAIL introduces novel
metrics to assess sustained effectiveness, diversity, and user burden, enabling
a comprehensive evaluation of AL methods under varying conditions. Extensive
experiments on datasets featuring dynamic, real-life human sensor data reveal
trade-offs between prediction performance and user burden, highlighting
limitations in existing AL strategies. GRAIL demonstrates the importance of
balancing node importance, query diversity, and network topology, providing an
evaluation mechanism for graph AL solutions in dynamic environments.

Motivation: 研究无感知设置下的多玩家多臂老虎机问题，其中玩家无法感知碰撞信息，且每个臂具有未知容量，提出了一种新的算法以解决协调和容量发现的挑战。

Method: 提出了A-CAPELLA算法，通过协作假设测试协议实现同步连续消除和容量估计，利用精心设计的碰撞模式。

Result: 算法在无感知设置下实现了对数级遗憾，证明了在未知臂容量情况下的高效学习能力。

Conclusion: A-CAPELLA算法在无感知多玩家多臂老虎机问题中表现高效，为未知臂容量的分布式学习提供了理论支持。

Abstract: We study the decentralized multi-player multi-armed bandits (MMAB) problem
under a no-sensing setting, where each player receives only their own reward
and obtains no information about collisions. Each arm has an unknown capacity,
and if the number of players pulling an arm exceeds its capacity, all players
involved receive zero reward. This setting generalizes the classical
unit-capacity model and introduces new challenges in coordination and capacity
discovery under severe feedback limitations. We propose A-CAPELLA (Algorithm
for Capacity-Aware Parallel Elimination for Learning and Allocation), a
decentralized algorithm that achieves logarithmic regret in this generalized
regime. Our main contribution is a collaborative hypothesis testing protocol
that enables synchronized successive elimination and capacity estimation
through carefully structured collision patterns. This represents a provably
efficient learning result in decentralized no-sensing MMAB with unknown arm
capacities.

TL;DR: 论文研究了离线域随机化（ODR），通过最大似然估计拟合模拟器参数分布，证明了其一致性，并提出了改进的E-DROPO方法以增强鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习代理从模拟到现实部署时存在性能差距，传统域随机化（DR）未利用离线数据。

Method: 提出离线域随机化（ODR），基于离线数据拟合模拟器参数分布，并证明其理论一致性。

Result: ODR的模拟到现实误差比均匀DR更紧，改进的E-DROPO方法提升了零样本迁移鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ODR为模拟到现实迁移提供了理论支持，E-DROPO进一步提升了实际性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement-learning agents often struggle when deployed from simulation to
the real-world. A dominant strategy for reducing the sim-to-real gap is domain
randomization (DR) which trains the policy across many simulators produced by
sampling dynamics parameters, but standard DR ignores offline data already
available from the real system. We study offline domain randomization (ODR),
which first fits a distribution over simulator parameters to an offline
dataset. While a growing body of empirical work reports substantial gains with
algorithms such as DROPO, the theoretical foundations of ODR remain largely
unexplored. In this work, we (i) formalize ODR as a maximum-likelihood
estimation over a parametric simulator family, (ii) prove consistency of this
estimator under mild regularity and identifiability conditions, showing it
converges to the true dynamics as the dataset grows, (iii) derive gap bounds
demonstrating ODRs sim-to-real error is up to an O(M) factor tighter than
uniform DR in the finite-simulator case (and analogous gains in the continuous
setting), and (iv) introduce E-DROPO, a new version of DROPO which adds an
entropy bonus to prevent variance collapse, yielding broader randomization and
more robust zero-shot transfer in practice.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为BYOL-γ增强GCBC的方法，通过改进状态表示的时间一致性，提升目标条件行为克隆（GCBC）在组合泛化任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标条件行为克隆（GCBC）在训练任务中表现良好，但在需要组合泛化的新任务中表现不佳，原因是状态表示缺乏时间一致性。

Method: 提出BYOL-γ增强GCBC，通过改进表示学习目标，无需对比样本或TD学习即可近似后继表示。

Result: 该方法在需要组合泛化的任务中表现出竞争力。

Conclusion: BYOL-γ增强GCBC通过改进时间一致性，有效提升了GCBC的组合泛化能力。

Abstract: Behavioral cloning (BC) methods trained with supervised learning (SL) are an
effective way to learn policies from human demonstrations in domains like
robotics. Goal-conditioning these policies enables a single generalist policy
to capture diverse behaviors contained within an offline dataset. While
goal-conditioned behavior cloning (GCBC) methods can perform well on
in-distribution training tasks, they do not necessarily generalize zero-shot to
tasks that require conditioning on novel state-goal pairs, i.e. combinatorial
generalization. In part, this limitation can be attributed to a lack of
temporal consistency in the state representation learned by BC; if temporally
related states are encoded to similar latent representations, then the
out-of-distribution gap for novel state-goal pairs would be reduced. Hence,
encouraging this temporal consistency in the representation space should
facilitate combinatorial generalization. Successor representations, which
encode the distribution of future states visited from the current state, nicely
encapsulate this property. However, previous methods for learning successor
representations have relied on contrastive samples, temporal-difference (TD)
learning, or both. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective
representation learning objective, $\text{BYOL-}\gamma$ augmented GCBC, which
is not only able to theoretically approximate the successor representation in
the finite MDP case without contrastive samples or TD learning, but also,
results in competitive empirical performance across a suite of challenging
tasks requiring combinatorial generalization.

Result: 结果表明RNN通过方向相关的激活通道表示计划，类似于价值函数，并通过专用核扩展路径。

Conclusion: 结论是该网络通过学习可理解的机制利用测试时计算，其机制与经典搜索类似但有所不同。

Abstract: We partially reverse-engineer a convolutional recurrent neural network (RNN)
trained to play the puzzle game Sokoban with model-free reinforcement learning.
Prior work found that this network solves more levels with more test-time
compute. Our analysis reveals several mechanisms analogous to components of
classic bidirectional search. For each square, the RNN represents its plan in
the activations of channels associated with specific directions. These
state-action activations are analogous to a value function - their magnitudes
determine when to backtrack and which plan branch survives pruning. Specialized
kernels extend these activations (containing plan and value) forward and
backward to create paths, forming a transition model. The algorithm is also
unlike classical search in some ways. State representation is not unified;
instead, the network considers each box separately. Each layer has its own plan
representation and value function, increasing search depth. Far from being
inscrutable, the mechanisms leveraging test-time compute learned in this
network by model-free training can be understood in familiar terms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了三种新的生存分析模型（iSurvM、iSurvQ、iSurvJ），结合不精确概率理论和注意力机制，有效处理复杂数据和重度截尾问题，性能优于传统Beran估计器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统非参数方法（如Beran估计器）在处理复杂数据结构和重度截尾时表现不佳，需要更灵活且无需参数假设的模型。

Method: 1. 用区间值概率分布表示截尾数据；2. 基于核的Nadaraya-Watson回归与注意力权重计算不精确概率分布；3. 提出三种训练决策策略对应三种模型。

Result: 实验表明，新模型（尤其是iSurvJ）在准确性和计算复杂度上均优于Beran估计器。

Conclusion: 新模型为生存分析提供了更灵活高效的解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Survival analysis is a fundamental tool for modeling time-to-event data in
healthcare, engineering, and finance, where censored observations pose
significant challenges. While traditional methods like the Beran estimator
offer nonparametric solutions, they often struggle with the complex data
structures and heavy censoring. This paper introduces three novel survival
models, iSurvM (the imprecise Survival model based on Mean likelihood
functions), iSurvQ (the imprecise Survival model based on the Quantiles of
likelihood functions), and iSurvJ (the imprecise Survival model based on the
Joint learning), that combine imprecise probability theory with attention
mechanisms to handle censored data without parametric assumptions. The first
idea behind the models is to represent censored observations by interval-valued
probability distributions for each instance over time intervals between events
moments. The second idea is to employ the kernel-based Nadaraya-Watson
regression with trainable attention weights for computing the imprecise
probability distribution over time intervals for the entire dataset. The third
idea is to consider three decision strategies for training, which correspond to
the proposed three models. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets
demonstrate that the proposed models, especially iSurvJ, consistently
outperform the Beran estimator from the accuracy and computational complexity
points of view. Codes implementing the proposed models are publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心衰是全球重大健康挑战，早期检测可改善预后。现有心率监测工具依赖群体平均值，缺乏个性化。

Method: 研究结合生理模型与神经网络，提出PMB-NN框架，通过氧摄取数据估计心率，并在12名参与者中进行测试。

Result: PMB-NN模型表现优异，中位R²为0.8，RMSE为8.3 bpm，优于传统生理模型（p=0.002）。

Conclusion: PMB-NN框架为个性化实时心脏监测提供了可能，未来可应用于日常活动中的心衰风险检测。

Abstract: Heart failure (HF) poses a significant global health challenge, with early
detection offering opportunities for improved outcomes. Abnormalities in heart
rate (HR), particularly during daily activities, may serve as early indicators
of HF risk. However, existing HR monitoring tools for HF detection are limited
by their reliability on population-based averages. The estimation of
individualized HR serves as a dynamic digital twin, enabling precise tracking
of cardiac health biomarkers. Current HR estimation methods, categorized into
physiologically-driven and purely data-driven models, struggle with efficiency
and interpretability. This study introduces a novel physiological-model-based
neural network (PMB-NN) framework for HR estimation based on oxygen uptake
(VO2) data during daily physical activities. The framework was trained and
tested on individual datasets from 12 participants engaged in activities
including resting, cycling, and running. By embedding physiological
constraints, which were derived from our proposed simplified human movement
physiological model (PM), into the neural network training process, the PMB-NN
model adheres to human physiological principles while achieving high estimation
accuracy, with a median R$^2$ score of 0.8 and an RMSE of 8.3 bpm. Comparative
statistical analysis demonstrates that the PMB-NN achieves performance on par
with the benchmark neural network model while significantly outperforming
traditional physiological model (p=0.002). In addition, our PMB-NN is adept at
identifying personalized parameters of the PM, enabling the PM to generate
reasonable HR estimation. The proposed framework with a precise VO2 estimation
system derived from body movements enables the future possibilities of
personalized and real-time cardiac monitoring during daily life physical
activities.

Method: 引入平衡双曲学习，通过双曲类嵌入算法优化层次失真和子层次平衡，并扩展分布外评分函数以支持双曲原型。

Result: 在13个数据集和13种评分函数上的实验表明，该方法优于现有技术和对比方法，并支持层次化分布外泛化。

Conclusion: 良好的层次双曲嵌入是区分分布内外样本的有效方法。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution recognition forms an important and well-studied problem
in deep learning, with the goal to filter out samples that do not belong to the
distribution on which a network has been trained. The conclusion of this paper
is simple: a good hierarchical hyperbolic embedding is preferred for
discriminating in- and out-of-distribution samples. We introduce Balanced
Hyperbolic Learning. We outline a hyperbolic class embedding algorithm that
jointly optimizes for hierarchical distortion and balancing between shallow and
wide subhierarchies. We then use the class embeddings as hyperbolic prototypes
for classification on in-distribution data. We outline how to generalize
existing out-of-distribution scoring functions to operate with hyperbolic
prototypes. Empirical evaluations across 13 datasets and 13 scoring functions
show that our hyperbolic embeddings outperform existing out-of-distribution
approaches when trained on the same data with the same backbones. We also show
that our hyperbolic embeddings outperform other hyperbolic approaches, beat
state-of-the-art contrastive methods, and natively enable hierarchical
out-of-distribution generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对比学习方法（如SimCLR和SupCon）缺乏不确定性量化机制，限制了其应用范围。

Method: VCL通过最大化证据下界（ELBO），将InfoNCE损失作为重构项，并添加KL散度正则化，建模后验分布为投影正态分布。

Result: VCL缓解了维度崩溃，增强了与类别标签的互信息，分类准确率与基线相当或更高，同时提供不确定性估计。

Conclusion: VCL为对比学习提供了概率基础，成为新的对比学习方法基础。

Abstract: Deterministic embeddings learned by contrastive learning (CL) methods such as
SimCLR and SupCon achieve state-of-the-art performance but lack a principled
mechanism for uncertainty quantification. We propose Variational Contrastive
Learning (VCL), a decoder-free framework that maximizes the evidence lower
bound (ELBO) by interpreting the InfoNCE loss as a surrogate reconstruction
term and adding a KL divergence regularizer to a uniform prior on the unit
hypersphere. We model the approximate posterior $q_\theta(z|x)$ as a projected
normal distribution, enabling the sampling of probabilistic embeddings. Our two
instantiations--VSimCLR and VSupCon--replace deterministic embeddings with
samples from $q_\theta(z|x)$ and incorporate a normalized KL term into the
loss. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that VCL mitigates
dimensional collapse, enhances mutual information with class labels, and
matches or outperforms deterministic baselines in classification accuracy, all
the while providing meaningful uncertainty estimates through the posterior
model. VCL thus equips contrastive learning with a probabilistic foundation,
serving as a new basis for contrastive approaches.

Result: 在MuJoCo连续控制任务中，WBSAC比现有算法更具样本效率。

Conclusion: WBSAC通过结合悲观和乐观策略，有效提升了稀疏奖励环境中的学习效率。

Abstract: Deep off-policy actor-critic algorithms have emerged as the leading framework
for reinforcement learning in continuous control domains. However, most of
these algorithms suffer from poor sample efficiency, especially in environments
with sparse rewards. In this paper, we take a step towards addressing this
issue by providing a principled directed exploration strategy. We propose
Wasserstein Barycenter Soft Actor-Critic (WBSAC) algorithm, which benefits from
a pessimistic actor for temporal difference learning and an optimistic actor to
promote exploration. This is achieved by using the Wasserstein barycenter of
the pessimistic and optimistic policies as the exploration policy and adjusting
the degree of exploration throughout the learning process. We compare WBSAC
with state-of-the-art off-policy actor-critic algorithms and show that WBSAC is
more sample-efficient on MuJoCo continuous control tasks.

Conclusion: 扩散模型的采样轨迹具有几何规律性，动态规划方法可高效优化采样过程。

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models employ stochastic differential equations
(SDEs) and their equivalent probability flow ordinary differential equations
(ODEs) to establish a smooth transformation between complex high-dimensional
data distributions and tractable prior distributions. In this paper, we reveal
a striking geometric regularity in the deterministic sampling dynamics: each
simulated sampling trajectory lies within an extremely low-dimensional
subspace, and all trajectories exhibit an almost identical ''boomerang'' shape,
regardless of the model architecture, applied conditions, or generated content.
We characterize several intriguing properties of these trajectories,
particularly under closed-form solutions based on kernel-estimated data
modeling. We also demonstrate a practical application of the discovered
trajectory regularity by proposing a dynamic programming-based scheme to better
align the sampling time schedule with the underlying trajectory structure. This
simple strategy requires minimal modification to existing ODE-based numerical
solvers, incurs negligible computational overhead, and achieves superior image
generation performance, especially in regions with only $5 \sim 10$ function
evaluations.

Abstract: Equivariant diffusion models have achieved impressive performance in 3D
molecule generation. These models incorporate Euclidean symmetries of 3D
molecules by utilizing an SE(3)-equivariant denoising network. However,
specialized equivariant architectures limit the scalability and efficiency of
diffusion models. In this paper, we propose an approach that relaxes such
equivariance constraints. Specifically, our approach learns a sample-dependent
SO(3) transformation for each molecule to construct an aligned latent space. A
non-equivariant diffusion model is then trained over the aligned
representations. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach performs
significantly better than previously reported non-equivariant models. It yields
sample quality comparable to state-of-the-art equivariant diffusion models and
offers improved training and sampling efficiency. Our code is available at

*Tina Behrouzi,Sana Tonekaboni,Rahul G. Krishnan,Anna Goldenberg*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DynaSubVAE是一种动态子群变分自编码器框架，通过联合表示学习和自适应OOD检测，动态更新潜在结构以捕捉新趋势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实观测数据中常存在与全局模式偏离的异质子群，现有模型往往忽略这些群体，导致预测不准确甚至有害。

Method: DynaSubVAE结合非参数聚类机制（受高斯混合模型启发），基于嵌入相似性发现和建模潜在子群。

Result: 实验表明，DynaSubVAE在近OOD和远OOD检测中表现优异，尤其在类OOD场景（训练中缺失整个类）中表现突出。

Conclusion: 动态子群机制在OOD准确性和后悔精度上优于独立聚类方法（如GMM和KMeans++）。

Abstract: Real-world observational data often contain existing or emerging
heterogeneous subpopulations that deviate from global patterns. The majority of
models tend to overlook these underrepresented groups, leading to inaccurate or
even harmful predictions. Existing solutions often rely on detecting these
samples as Out-of-domain (OOD) rather than adapting the model to new emerging
patterns. We introduce DynaSubVAE, a Dynamic Subgrouping Variational
Autoencoder framework that jointly performs representation learning and
adaptive OOD detection. Unlike conventional approaches, DynaSubVAE evolves with
the data by dynamically updating its latent structure to capture new trends. It
leverages a novel non-parametric clustering mechanism, inspired by Gaussian
Mixture Models, to discover and model latent subgroups based on embedding
similarity. Extensive experiments show that DynaSubVAE achieves competitive
performance in both near-OOD and far-OOD detection, and excels in class-OOD
scenarios where an entire class is missing during training. We further
illustrate that our dynamic subgrouping mechanism outperforms standalone
clustering methods such as GMM and KMeans++ in terms of both OOD accuracy and
regret precision.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型（LLMs）在边缘设备上部署时的模型压缩问题，结合剪枝和量化方法。

Method: 基于迭代硬阈值（IHT）的投影梯度下降方法，统一处理激活感知权重剪枝和量化。

Result: AWP在剪枝和量化任务上优于现有方法，并提供了理论收敛保证。

Conclusion: AWP是一种高效且理论支持的模型压缩方法，适用于LLMs的部署。

Abstract: To address the enormous size of Large Language Models (LLMs), model
compression methods, such as quantization and pruning, are often deployed,
especially on edge devices. In this work, we focus on layer-wise post-training
quantization and pruning. Drawing connections between activation-aware weight
pruning and sparse approximation problems, and motivated by the success of
Iterative Hard Thresholding (IHT), we propose a unified method for
Activation-aware Weight pruning and quantization via Projected gradient descent
(AWP). Our experiments demonstrate that AWP outperforms state-of-the-art LLM
pruning and quantization methods. Theoretical convergence guarantees of the
proposed method for pruning are also provided.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究通过ECG和PCG信号的多模态分析，探索其相互重建和生物标志物提取的潜力，发现非线性模型（如非因果LSTM）在重建中表现最佳，且PCG到ECG的重建更可行。运动和多受试者场景具有挑战性，但基于包络的建模提高了跨受试者泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ECG和PCG分别捕捉心脏的电活动和机械活动，但两者之间的信息重叠和相互重建潜力尚未完全理解，尤其是在不同生理条件和个体间。

Method: 使用EPHNOGRAM数据集，结合线性和非线性机器学习模型（如非因果LSTM），分析ECG和PCG的共同和独有特征，并探索其相互重建能力。

Result: 非线性模型（尤其是非因果LSTM）在重建中表现最佳，PCG到ECG的重建更可行。运动和多受试者场景具有挑战性，但包络建模提高了泛化能力。部分ECG生物标志物可从PCG中估计。

Conclusion: 研究深化了对心脏电机械模态关系的理解，为新型多模态心脏监测技术提供了潜在应用。

Abstract: Simultaneous electrocardiography (ECG) and phonocardiogram (PCG) provide a
comprehensive, multimodal perspective on cardiac function by capturing the
heart's electrical and mechanical activities, respectively. However, the
distinct and overlapping information content of these signals, as well as their
potential for mutual reconstruction and biomarker extraction, remains
incompletely understood, especially under varying physiological conditions and
across individuals.
  In this study, we systematically investigate the common and exclusive
characteristics of ECG and PCG using the EPHNOGRAM dataset of simultaneous
ECG-PCG recordings during rest and exercise. We employ a suite of linear and
nonlinear machine learning models, including non-causal LSTM networks, to
reconstruct each modality from the other and analyze the influence of
causality, physiological state, and cross-subject variability. Our results
demonstrate that nonlinear models, particularly non-causal LSTM, provide
superior reconstruction performance, with reconstructing ECG from PCG proving
more tractable than the reverse. Exercise and cross-subject scenarios present
significant challenges, but envelope-based modeling that utilizes instantaneous
amplitude features substantially improves cross-subject generalizability for
cross-modal learning. Furthermore, we demonstrate that clinically relevant ECG
biomarkers, such as fiducial points and QT intervals, can be estimated from PCG
in cross-subject settings.
  These findings advance our understanding of the relationship between
electromechanical cardiac modalities, in terms of both waveform characteristics
and the timing of cardiac events, with potential applications in novel
multimodal cardiac monitoring technologies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LaMAGIC2提出了一种新的SFCI方法，用于语言模型驱动的模拟拓扑生成，解决了现有方法的低效和低精度问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代应用对模拟拓扑设计的定制化需求高，但现有方法存在效率低和精度不足的问题。

Method: 采用SFCI（简洁浮点输入规范表示）方法，通过标识符改进组件类型识别，降低复杂度并提高数值精度。

Result: 实验显示，LaMAGIC2在0.01的严格容差下成功率提高34%，MSE降低10倍，且在更多顶点电路中表现更优。

Conclusion: LaMAGIC2为模拟拓扑生成提供了一个高效且高精度的框架。

Abstract: Automation of analog topology design is crucial due to customized
requirements of modern applications with heavily manual engineering efforts.
The state-of-the-art work applies a sequence-to-sequence approach and
supervised finetuning on language models to generate topologies given user
specifications. However, its circuit formulation is inefficient due to O(|V |2)
token length and suffers from low precision sensitivity to numeric inputs. In
this work, we introduce LaMAGIC2, a succinct float-input canonical formulation
with identifier (SFCI) for language model-based analog topology generation.
SFCI addresses these challenges by improving component-type recognition through
identifier-based representations, reducing token length complexity to O(|V |),
and enhancing numeric precision sensitivity for better performance under tight
tolerances. Our experiments demonstrate that LaMAGIC2 achieves 34% higher
success rates under a tight tolerance of 0.01 and 10X lower MSEs compared to a
prior method. LaMAGIC2 also exhibits better transferability for circuits with
more vertices with up to 58.5% improvement. These advancements establish
LaMAGIC2 as a robust framework for analog topology generation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为DC-Clustering的新型联邦聚类方法，支持在水平和垂直数据分割共存的复杂场景下进行聚类，同时保护隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦聚类方法仅适用于简单数据分割场景，无法处理复杂分布式结构，因此需要一种更灵活的方法。

Method: DC-Clustering通过共享中间表示而非原始数据实现隐私保护，支持k-means和谱聚类，仅需一轮中央服务器通信。

Result: 实验表明，DC-Clustering的性能与集中式聚类相当，适用于分布式异构数据。

Conclusion: DC-Clustering填补了联邦学习研究的空白，具有隐私保护、通信高效和灵活性等优势，适用于医疗和金融等领域。

Abstract: In recent years, the growing need to leverage sensitive data across
institutions has led to increased attention on federated learning (FL), a
decentralized machine learning paradigm that enables model training without
sharing raw data. However, existing FL-based clustering methods, known as
federated clustering, typically assume simple data partitioning scenarios such
as horizontal or vertical splits, and cannot handle more complex distributed
structures. This study proposes data collaboration clustering (DC-Clustering),
a novel federated clustering method that supports clustering over complex data
partitioning scenarios where horizontal and vertical splits coexist. In
DC-Clustering, each institution shares only intermediate representations
instead of raw data, ensuring privacy preservation while enabling collaborative
clustering. The method allows flexible selection between k-means and spectral
clustering, and achieves final results with a single round of communication
with the central server. We conducted extensive experiments using synthetic and
open benchmark datasets. The results show that our method achieves clustering
performance comparable to centralized clustering where all data are pooled.
DC-Clustering addresses an important gap in current FL research by enabling
effective knowledge discovery from distributed heterogeneous data. Its
practical properties -- privacy preservation, communication efficiency, and
flexibility -- make it a promising tool for privacy-sensitive domains such as
healthcare and finance.

TL;DR: 提出一种元学习方法，用于从多个噪声标注者中学习，通过利用相关任务的标注数据解决数据不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在众包等服务中，标注者的技能或偏见导致标签噪声，现有方法需大量噪声数据，但实践中数据可能不足。

Method: 嵌入任务样本到潜在空间，构建概率模型估计标注者能力，并通过EM算法优化分类器，元学习神经网络以提高测试性能。

Result: 在合成噪声和真实众包数据集上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法能高效利用少量标注数据，提升分类性能。

Abstract: We propose a meta-learning method for learning from multiple noisy
annotators. In many applications such as crowdsourcing services, labels for
supervised learning are given by multiple annotators. Since the annotators have
different skills or biases, given labels can be noisy. To learn accurate
classifiers, existing methods require many noisy annotated data. However,
sufficient data might be unavailable in practice. To overcome the lack of data,
the proposed method uses labeled data obtained in different but related tasks.
The proposed method embeds each example in tasks to a latent space by using a
neural network and constructs a probabilistic model for learning a
task-specific classifier while estimating annotators' abilities on the latent
space. This neural network is meta-learned to improve the expected test
classification performance when the classifier is adapted to a given small
amount of annotated data. This classifier adaptation is performed by maximizing
the posterior probability via the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm.
Since each step in the EM algorithm is easily computed as a closed-form and is
differentiable, the proposed method can efficiently backpropagate the loss
through the EM algorithm to meta-learn the neural network. We show the
effectiveness of our method with real-world datasets with synthetic noise and
real-world crowdsourcing datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SDP松弛方法在深度神经网络验证中表现优越，但随着网络深度增加，严格可行性可能丧失，影响数值稳定性和最优性。

Method: 通过理论和实证分析，识别内点消失问题，并设计五种解决方案以增强可行性条件。

Result: 新方法成功解决了88%的现有方法无法处理的问题，占总问题的41%。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了SDP验证的根本挑战，并提出实用解决方案，为更可靠的DNN系统开发提供支持。

Abstract: Semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation has emerged as a promising approach
for neural network verification, offering tighter bounds than other convex
relaxation methods for deep neural networks (DNNs) with ReLU activations.
However, we identify a critical limitation in the SDP relaxation when applied
to deep networks: interior-point vanishing, which leads to the loss of strict
feasibility -- a crucial condition for the numerical stability and optimality
of SDP. Through rigorous theoretical and empirical analysis, we demonstrate
that as the depth of DNNs increases, the strict feasibility is likely to be
lost, creating a fundamental barrier to scaling SDP-based verification. To
address the interior-point vanishing, we design and investigate five solutions
to enhance the feasibility conditions of the verification problem. Our methods
can successfully solve 88% of the problems that could not be solved by existing
methods, accounting for 41% of the total. Our analysis also reveals that the
valid constraints for the lower and upper bounds for each ReLU unit are
traditionally inherited from prior work without solid reasons, but are actually
not only unbeneficial but also even harmful to the problem's feasibility. This
work provides valuable insights into the fundamental challenges of SDP-based
DNN verification and offers practical solutions to improve its applicability to
deeper neural networks, contributing to the development of more reliable and
secure systems with DNNs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在多模态图学习中缺乏统一的评估基准，难以衡量不同方法的进展。

Method: 通过Graph-MLLM基准系统评估三种范式（Encoder、Aligner、Predictor），并分析视觉与文本属性的结合效果。

Result: 视觉与文本属性结合提升性能；将视觉属性转为文本描述效果更佳；微调MLLMs在多数场景下达到最优。

Conclusion: Graph-MLLM为多模态图学习提供了公平评估工具，并展示了微调MLLMs的潜力。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in representing and understanding diverse modalities. However,
they typically focus on modality alignment in a pairwise manner while
overlooking structural relationships across data points. Integrating
multimodality with structured graph information (i.e., multimodal graphs, MMGs)
is essential for real-world applications such as social networks, healthcare,
and recommendation systems. Existing MMG learning methods fall into three
paradigms based on how they leverage MLLMs: Encoder, Aligner, and Predictor.
MLLM-as-Encoder focuses on enhancing graph neural networks (GNNs) via
multimodal feature fusion; MLLM-as-Aligner aligns multimodal attributes in
language or hidden space to enable LLM-based graph reasoning; MLLM-as-Predictor
treats MLLMs as standalone reasoners with in-context learning or fine-tuning.
Despite their advances, the MMG field lacks a unified benchmark to fairly
evaluate across these approaches, making it unclear what progress has been
made. To bridge this gap, we present Graph-MLLM, a comprehensive benchmark for
multimodal graph learning by systematically evaluating these three paradigms
across six datasets with different domains. Through extensive experiments, we
observe that jointly considering the visual and textual attributes of the nodes
benefits graph learning, even when using pre-trained text-to-image alignment
models (e.g., CLIP) as encoders. We also find that converting visual attributes
into textual descriptions further improves performance compared to directly
using visual inputs. Moreover, we observe that fine-tuning MLLMs on specific
MMGs can achieve state-of-the-art results in most scenarios, even without
explicit graph structure information. We hope that our open-sourced library
will facilitate rapid, equitable evaluation and inspire further innovative
research in this field.

Result: Col-UCB实现了最优的极小极大和实例依赖协作遗憾，适应共享动作集结构。

Conclusion: 协作在特定结构下优于独立学习，Col-UCB提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We study the impact of sharing exploration in multi-armed bandits in a
grouped setting where a set of groups have overlapping feasible action sets
[Baek and Farias '24]. In this grouped bandit setting, groups share reward
observations, and the objective is to minimize the collaborative regret,
defined as the maximum regret across groups. This naturally captures
applications in which one aims to balance the exploration burden between groups
or populations -- it is known that standard algorithms can lead to
significantly imbalanced exploration cost between groups. We address this
problem by introducing an algorithm Col-UCB that dynamically coordinates
exploration across groups. We show that Col-UCB achieves both optimal minimax
and instance-dependent collaborative regret up to logarithmic factors. These
bounds are adaptive to the structure of shared action sets between groups,
providing insights into when collaboration yields significant benefits over
each group learning their best action independently.

Result: 实验结果表明，元学习方法显著优于预训练模型，提高了预测精度。

Conclusion: 该方法为开放编辑平台上的傀儡账户检测提供了新思路，并发布了新数据集以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Malicious sockpuppet detection on Wikipedia is critical to preserving access
to reliable information on the internet and preventing the spread of
disinformation. Prior machine learning approaches rely on stylistic and
meta-data features, but do not prioritise adaptability to author-specific
behaviours. As a result, they struggle to effectively model the behaviour of
specific sockpuppet-groups, especially when text data is limited. To address
this, we propose the application of meta-learning, a machine learning technique
designed to improve performance in data-scarce settings by training models
across multiple tasks. Meta-learning optimises a model for rapid adaptation to
the writing style of a new sockpuppet-group. Our results show that
meta-learning significantly enhances the precision of predictions compared to
pre-trained models, marking an advancement in combating sockpuppetry on open
editing platforms. We release a new dataset of sockpuppet investigations to
foster future research in both sockpuppetry and meta-learning fields.

Motivation: 解决现有学习优化器（如VeLO）因依赖JAX和缺乏用户友好包而难以被广泛使用的问题。

Method: 开发PyLO库，支持CUDA加速，并整合现有优化工具（如学习率调度和权重衰减）。

Result: PyLO显著提升了训练速度（如ViT B/16的吞吐量从39.36提高到205.59样本/秒），并证明学习优化器与其他工具结合能带来更大收益。

Conclusion: PyLO为学习优化器的实际应用提供了便捷途径，展示了其在真实大规模任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Learned optimizers have been an active research topic over the past decade,
with increasing progress toward practical, general-purpose optimizers that can
serve as drop-in replacements for widely used methods like Adam. However,
recent advances -- such as VeLO, which was meta-trained for 4000 TPU-months --
remain largely inaccessible to the broader community, in part due to their
reliance on JAX and the absence of user-friendly packages for applying the
optimizers after meta-training. To address this gap, we introduce PyLO, a
PyTorch-based library that brings learned optimizers to the broader machine
learning community through familiar, widely adopted workflows. Unlike prior
work focused on synthetic or convex tasks, our emphasis is on applying learned
optimization to real-world large-scale pre-training tasks. Our release includes
a CUDA-accelerated version of the small_fc_lopt learned optimizer architecture
from (Metz et al., 2022a), delivering substantial speedups -- from 39.36 to
205.59 samples/sec throughput for training ViT B/16 with batch size 32. PyLO
also allows us to easily combine learned optimizers with existing optimization
tools such as learning rate schedules and weight decay. When doing so, we find
that learned optimizers can substantially benefit. Our code is available at

Abstract: Air pollution has become a significant health risk in developing countries.
While governments routinely publish air-quality index (AQI) data to track
pollution, these values fail to capture the local reality, as sensors are often
very sparse. In this paper, we address this gap by predicting AQI in 1 km^2
neighborhoods, using the example of AirDelhi dataset. Using Spatio-temporal
GNNs we surpass existing works by 71.654 MSE a 79% reduction, even on unseen
coordinates. New insights about AQI such as the existence of strong repetitive
short-term patterns and changing spatial relations are also discovered. The
code is available on GitHub.

Result: HELiX在多个实验领域中表现优异，且在某些情况下比从奖励中学习更高效。

Conclusion: 本文为从通用语言反馈中设计交互式学习算法迈出了第一步。

Abstract: Interactively learning from observation and language feedback is an
increasingly studied area driven by the emergence of large language model (LLM)
agents. While impressive empirical demonstrations have been shown, so far a
principled framing of these decision problems remains lacking. In this paper,
we formalize the Learning from Language Feedback (LLF) problem, assert
sufficient assumptions to enable learning despite latent rewards, and introduce
$\textit{transfer eluder dimension}$ as a complexity measure to characterize
the hardness of LLF problems. We show that transfer eluder dimension captures
the intuition that information in the feedback changes the learning complexity
of the LLF problem. We demonstrate cases where learning from rich language
feedback can be exponentially faster than learning from reward. We develop a
no-regret algorithm, called $\texttt{HELiX}$, that provably solves LLF problems
through sequential interactions, with performance guarantees that scale with
the transfer eluder dimension of the problem. Across several empirical domains,
we show that $\texttt{HELiX}$ performs well even when repeatedly prompting LLMs
does not work reliably. Our contributions mark a first step towards designing
principled interactive learning algorithms from generic language feedback.

Conclusion: 该方法为生理信号分析奠定了基础，多模态设计对可穿戴健康监测和临床诊断具有潜在影响。

Abstract: Physiological signals are often corrupted by motion artifacts, baseline
drift, and other low-SNR disturbances, which pose significant challenges for
analysis. Additionally, these signals exhibit strong non-stationarity, with
sharp peaks and abrupt changes that evolve continuously, making them difficult
to represent using traditional time-domain or filtering methods. To address
these issues, a novel wavelet-based approach for physiological signal analysis
is presented, aiming to capture multi-scale time-frequency features in various
physiological signals. Leveraging this technique, two large-scale pretrained
models specific to EMG and ECG are introduced for the first time, achieving
superior performance and setting new baselines in downstream tasks.
Additionally, a unified multi-modal framework is constructed by integrating
pretrained EEG model, where each modality is guided through its dedicated
branch and fused via learnable weighted fusion. This design effectively
addresses challenges such as low signal-to-noise ratio, high inter-subject
variability, and device mismatch, outperforming existing methods on multi-modal
tasks. The proposed wavelet-based architecture lays a solid foundation for
analysis of diverse physiological signals, while the multi-modal design points
to next-generation physiological signal processing with potential impact on
wearable health monitoring, clinical diagnostics, and broader biomedical
applications.

Conclusion: HANO为模拟非弹性材料提供了有效的数据驱动替代方案，适合与传统数值求解器集成。

Abstract: This study presents an end-to-end learning framework for data-driven modeling
of path-dependent inelastic materials using neural operators. The framework is
built on the premise that irreversible evolution of material responses,
governed by hidden dynamics, can be inferred from observable data.
  We develop the History-Aware Neural Operator (HANO), an autoregressive model
that predicts path-dependent material responses from short segments of recent
strain-stress history without relying on hidden state variables, thereby
overcoming self-consistency issues commonly encountered in recurrent neural
network (RNN)-based models. Built on a Fourier-based neural operator backbone,
HANO enables discretization-invariant learning. To enhance its ability to
capture both global loading patterns and critical local path dependencies, we
embed a hierarchical self-attention mechanism that facilitates multiscale
feature extraction.
  Beyond ensuring self-consistency, HANO mitigates sensitivity to initial
hidden states, a commonly overlooked issue that can lead to instability in
recurrent models when applied to generalized loading paths. By modeling
stress-strain evolution as a continuous operator rather than relying on fixed
input-output mappings, HANO naturally accommodates varying path discretizations
and exhibits robust performance under complex conditions, including irregular
sampling, multi-cycle loading, noisy data, and pre-stressed states. We evaluate
HANO on two benchmark problems: elastoplasticity with hardening and progressive
anisotropic damage in brittle solids. Results show that HANO consistently
outperforms baseline models in predictive accuracy, generalization, and
robustness. With its demonstrated capabilities, HANO provides an effective
data-driven surrogate for simulating inelastic materials and is well-suited for
integration with classical numerical solvers.

TL;DR: TreeLoRA提出了一种基于分层梯度相似性的低秩适配器方法，用于大预训练模型的高效持续学习，通过Bandit技术和稀疏梯度更新优化计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中数据以流式环境收集，需要持续学习来更新模型，同时避免灾难性遗忘。大预训练模型的计算需求使得效率成为关键问题。

Method: 利用分层梯度相似性构建层间适配器，采用Bandit技术和稀疏梯度更新来优化任务相似性估计和参数优化。

Result: 在视觉Transformer和大型语言模型上的实验验证了方法的有效性和高效性。

Conclusion: TreeLoRA为大规模预训练模型的持续学习提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Many real-world applications collect data in a streaming environment, where
learning tasks are encountered sequentially. This necessitates continual
learning (CL) to update models online, enabling adaptation to new tasks while
preserving past knowledge to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Nowadays, with
the flourish of large pre-trained models (LPMs), efficiency has become
increasingly critical for CL, due to their substantial computational demands
and growing parameter sizes. In this paper, we introduce TreeLoRA (K-D Tree of
Low-Rank Adapters), a novel approach that constructs layer-wise adapters by
leveraging hierarchical gradient similarity to enable efficient CL,
particularly for LPMs. To reduce the computational burden of task similarity
estimation, we employ bandit techniques to develop an algorithm based on lower
confidence bounds to efficiently explore the task structure. Furthermore, we
use sparse gradient updates to facilitate parameter optimization, making the
approach better suited for LPMs. Theoretical analysis is provided to justify
the rationale behind our approach, and experiments on both vision transformers
(ViTs) and large language models (LLMs) demonstrate the effectiveness and
efficiency of our approach across various domains, including vision and natural
language processing tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了针对大型语言模型（LLMs）的属性推断攻击，提出了PropInfer基准任务，并设计了两种攻击方法，揭示了LLMs在微调过程中可能泄露敏感信息的漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在特定领域（如医疗、金融和法律）的微调应用增多，如何保护数据集级别的敏感属性（如患者人口统计或疾病流行率）成为重要问题。此前研究主要关注判别模型和生成模型，但LLMs的属性推断攻击尚未明确。

Method: 论文提出了PropInfer基准任务，基于ChatDoctor数据集，涵盖多种属性类型和任务配置。设计了两种攻击方法：基于提示的生成攻击和基于词频信号的影子模型攻击。

Result: 实验表明，这两种攻击方法在多个预训练LLMs上均取得成功，揭示了LLMs在微调过程中存在未识别的漏洞。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了LLMs在微调过程中可能泄露敏感信息的风险，为未来LLMs的安全设计和隐私保护提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly fine-tuned on domain-specific
datasets to support applications in fields such as healthcare, finance, and
law. These fine-tuning datasets often have sensitive and confidential
dataset-level properties -- such as patient demographics or disease prevalence
-- that are not intended to be revealed. While prior work has studied property
inference attacks on discriminative models (e.g., image classification models)
and generative models (e.g., GANs for image data), it remains unclear if such
attacks transfer to LLMs. In this work, we introduce PropInfer, a benchmark
task for evaluating property inference in LLMs under two fine-tuning paradigms:
question-answering and chat-completion. Built on the ChatDoctor dataset, our
benchmark includes a range of property types and task configurations. We
further propose two tailored attacks: a prompt-based generation attack and a
shadow-model attack leveraging word frequency signals. Empirical evaluations
across multiple pretrained LLMs show the success of our attacks, revealing a
previously unrecognized vulnerability in LLMs.

Result: 在1500多个模型的数据集中，识别出一个三节点线性因果结构，揭示了从通用问题解决到数学推理能力的因果方向。

Conclusion: 研究强调了控制基础模型变异的必要性，以准确揭示潜在模型能力间的因果关系。

Abstract: Faithful evaluation of language model capabilities is crucial for deriving
actionable insights that can inform model development. However, rigorous causal
evaluations in this domain face significant methodological challenges,
including complex confounding effects and prohibitive computational costs
associated with extensive retraining. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
causal representation learning framework wherein observed benchmark performance
is modeled as a linear transformation of a few latent capability factors.
Crucially, these latent factors are identified as causally interrelated after
appropriately controlling for the base model as a common confounder. Applying
this approach to a comprehensive dataset encompassing over 1500 models
evaluated across six benchmarks from the Open LLM Leaderboard, we identify a
concise three-node linear causal structure that reliably explains the observed
performance variations. Further interpretation of this causal structure
provides substantial scientific insights beyond simple numerical rankings:
specifically, we reveal a clear causal direction starting from general
problem-solving capabilities, advancing through instruction-following
proficiency, and culminating in mathematical reasoning ability. Our results
underscore the essential role of carefully controlling base model variations
during evaluation, a step critical to accurately uncovering the underlying
causal relationships among latent model capabilities.

Conclusion: EQA-RM为EQA任务提供了高效、可解释的奖励模型，并开源代码与数据集。

Abstract: Reward Models (RMs), vital for large model alignment, are underexplored for
complex embodied tasks like Embodied Question Answering (EQA) where nuanced
evaluation of agents' spatial, temporal, and logical understanding is critical
yet not considered by generic approaches. We introduce EQA-RM, a novel
generative multimodal reward model specifically architected for EQA, trained
via our innovative Contrastive Group Relative Policy Optimization (C-GRPO)
strategy to learn fine-grained behavioral distinctions. The generative nature
of EQA-RM provides interpretable, structured reward feedback (beyond simple
scalars), uniquely enabling test-time scaling to dynamically adjust evaluation
granularity, from concise scores to detailed critiques of reasoning and
grounding, at inference without retraining. Concurrently, we introduce
EQARewardBench, a new benchmark built on OpenEQA for standardized EQA reward
model assessment. Demonstrating high sample efficiency, EQA-RM (fine-tuning
Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct) achieves 61.9\% accuracy on EQA-RM-Bench with only 700
samples, outperforming strong proprietary baselines, including

Result: 程序评判减少了偏见，一致性提升15.83%，偏见响应减少23.7%，在CHAT-HARD子集上表现优于LLM评分。

Conclusion: PAJAMA提供了一种高效、低成本且可解释的LLM生成内容评估方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used to evaluate the quality of LLM
generations and responses, but this leads to significant challenges: high API
costs, uncertain reliability, inflexible pipelines, and inherent biases. To
address these, we introduce PAJAMA (Program-As-a-Judge for Automated Model
Assessment), a new alternative that uses LLMs to synthesize executable judging
programs instead of directly scoring responses. These synthesized programs can
be stored and run locally, costing orders of magnitude less while providing
interpretable, and auditable judging logic that can be easily adapted.
Program-based judges mitigate biases, improving judgment consistency by 15.83%
and reducing biased responses by 23.7% on average compared to a
Qwen2.5-14B-based LLM-as-a-judge. When program judgments are distilled into a
model, PAJAMA outperforms LLM-as-a-judge on the challenging CHAT-HARD subset of
RewardBench, outperforming metrics by 2.19% on Prometheus and 8.67% on the
JudgeLM dataset, all at three orders of magnitude lower cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 野火蔓延预测的复杂性导致多日模拟结果与观测数据存在偏差，因此需要数据同化方法改进预测准确性。

Method: 使用cGAN从VIIRS和GOES卫星数据及地形数据中估计火灾蔓延时间，训练数据来自WRF-SFIRE模型模拟的历史火灾。

Result: 在五场太平洋地区野火中验证，平均Sorensen-Dice系数为0.81，地形对推断影响较小。

Conclusion: 该方法有效整合了卫星测量与模型物理，提高了火灾蔓延预测的准确性。

Abstract: Increasing wildfire occurrence has spurred growing interest in wildfire
spread prediction. However, even the most complex wildfire models diverge from
observed progression during multi-day simulations, motivating need for data
assimilation. A useful approach to assimilating measurement data into complex
coupled atmosphere-wildfire models is to estimate wildfire progression from
measurements and use this progression to develop a matching atmospheric state.
In this study, an approach is developed for estimating fire progression from
VIIRS active fire measurements, GOES-derived ignition times, and terrain height
data. A conditional Generative Adversarial Network is trained with simulations
of historic wildfires from the atmosphere-wildfire model WRF-SFIRE, thus
allowing incorporation of WRF-SFIRE physics into estimates. Fire progression is
succinctly represented by fire arrival time, and measurements for training are
obtained by applying an approximate observation operator to WRF-SFIRE
solutions, eliminating need for satellite data during training. The model is
trained on tuples of fire arrival times, measurements, and terrain, and once
trained leverages measurements of real fires and corresponding terrain data to
generate samples of fire arrival times. The approach is validated on five
Pacific US wildfires, with results compared against high-resolution perimeters
measured via aircraft, finding an average Sorensen-Dice coefficient of 0.81.
The influence of terrain height on the arrival time inference is also evaluated
and it is observed that terrain has minimal influence when the inference is
conditioned on satellite measurements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界的时间序列数据（如医疗、气候、金融）通常不规则、多模态且杂乱，现有基准假设数据干净、规则采样，与实际应用存在差距。

Method: 提出Time-IMM数据集捕捉九种不规则性，并开发IMM-TSF基准库，支持异步融合和多种集成策略。

Result: 实验表明，显式建模多模态和不规则性显著提升预测性能。

Conclusion: Time-IMM和IMM-TSF为现实条件下时间序列分析提供了基础工具。

Abstract: Time series data in real-world applications such as healthcare, climate
modeling, and finance are often irregular, multimodal, and messy, with varying
sampling rates, asynchronous modalities, and pervasive missingness. However,
existing benchmarks typically assume clean, regularly sampled, unimodal data,
creating a significant gap between research and real-world deployment. We
introduce Time-IMM, a dataset specifically designed to capture cause-driven
irregularity in multimodal multivariate time series. Time-IMM represents nine
distinct types of time series irregularity, categorized into trigger-based,
constraint-based, and artifact-based mechanisms. Complementing the dataset, we
introduce IMM-TSF, a benchmark library for forecasting on irregular multimodal
time series, enabling asynchronous integration and realistic evaluation.
IMM-TSF includes specialized fusion modules, including a timestamp-to-text
fusion module and a multimodality fusion module, which support both
recency-aware averaging and attention-based integration strategies. Empirical
results demonstrate that explicitly modeling multimodality on irregular time
series data leads to substantial gains in forecasting performance. Time-IMM and
IMM-TSF provide a foundation for advancing time series analysis under
real-world conditions. The dataset is publicly available at
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blacksnail789521/time-imm/data, and the
benchmark library can be accessed at

Motivation: 传统cLHS方法可能忽略重要的环境集群，导致采样不全面。

Method: 使用光谱聚类将研究区域划分为K个同质区域，然后在每个区域内应用cLHS选择采样点。

Result: 光谱-cLHS方法比标准cLHS更均匀地覆盖协变量特征空间和空间异质性。

Conclusion: 该方法能提供更平衡的训练数据，从而提高SOC预测的准确性。

Abstract: Soil organic carbon (SOC) monitoring often relies on selecting representative
field sampling locations based on environmental covariates. We propose a novel
hybrid methodology that integrates spectral clustering - an unsupervised
machine learning technique with conditioned Latin hypercube sampling (cLHS) to
enhance the representativeness of SOC sampling. In our approach, spectral
clustering partitions the study area into $K$ homogeneous zones using
multivariate covariate data, and cLHS is then applied within each zone to
select sampling locations that collectively capture the full diversity of
environmental conditions. This hybrid spectral-cLHS method ensures that even
minor but important environmental clusters are sampled, addressing a key
limitation of vanilla cLHS which can overlook such areas. We demonstrate on a
real SOC mapping dataset that spectral-cLHS provides more uniform coverage of
covariate feature space and spatial heterogeneity than standard cLHS. This
improved sampling design has the potential to yield more accurate SOC
predictions by providing better-balanced training data for machine learning
models.

Conclusion: KANs 在现代工业系统辨识中具有显著的应用潜力。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) are emerging as a powerful framework for
interpretable and efficient system identification in dynamic systems. By
leveraging the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, KANs enable function
approximation through learnable activation functions, offering improved
scalability, accuracy, and interpretability compared to traditional neural
networks. This paper investigates the application of KANs to model and analyze
the dynamics of a buck converter system, focusing on state-space parameter
estimation along with discovering the system equations. Using simulation data,
the methodology involves approximating state derivatives with KANs,
constructing interpretable state-space representations, and validating these
models through numerical experiments. The results demonstrate the ability of
KANs to accurately identify system dynamics, verify model consistency, and
detect parameter changes, providing valuable insights into their applicability

through a time- and data-dependent transformation that is equivariant to rigid
transformations. Through a series of experiments on standard molecule
generation benchmarks, we demonstrate the competitive performance of END
compared to several strong baselines for both unconditional and conditional
generation.

Abstract: This study investigates the performance of machine learning models in

We evaluate four models, namely LSTM with Feed Forward Error Correction (FFEC),

Training window lengths range from 7 to 90 days, allowing assessment of model
adaptability under constrained data availability. Results indicate that
LightGBM consistently achieves the highest forecasting accuracy and robustness,
particularly with 45 and 60 day training windows, which balance temporal
relevance and learning depth. Furthermore, LightGBM demonstrates superior
detection of seasonal effects and peak price events compared to LSTM and other

Conclusion: 该方法能高效自动化PCB设计优化，节省时间和成本。

Abstract: The design and optimization of Printed Circuit Board (PCB) schematics is
crucial for the development of high-quality electronic devices. Thereby, an
important task is to optimize drafts by adding components that improve the
robustness and reliability of the circuit, e.g., pull-up resistors or
decoupling capacitors. Since there is a shortage of skilled engineers and
manual optimizations are very time-consuming, these best practices are often
neglected. However, this typically leads to higher costs for troubleshooting in
later development stages as well as shortened product life cycles, resulting in
an increased amount of electronic waste that is difficult to recycle. Here, we
present an approach for automating the addition of new components into PCB
schematics by representing them as bipartite graphs and utilizing a node pair
prediction model based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). We apply our approach
to three highly relevant PCB design optimization tasks and compare the
performance of several popular GNN architectures on real-world datasets labeled
by human experts. We show that GNNs can solve these problems with high accuracy
and demonstrate that our approach offers the potential to automate PCB design
optimizations in a time- and cost-efficient manner.

Motivation: 现有公平性评估方法依赖单点估计，忽略抽样误差，对小规模群体处理不足，尤其在交叉分析中问题更严重。

Method: 结合中心极限定理推导置信区间和Wald检验（大群体），以及贝叶斯Dirichlet-多项式估计器（小群体）。

Result: 验证了方法在基准数据集上的有效性，提供了可解释且统计严谨的决策。

Conclusion: 框架适用于不同数据规模和交叉性，解决了公平性评估中的统计脆弱性问题。

Abstract: Determining whether an algorithmic decision-making system discriminates
against a specific demographic typically involves comparing a single point
estimate of a fairness metric against a predefined threshold. This practice is
statistically brittle: it ignores sampling error and treats small demographic
subgroups the same as large ones. The problem intensifies in intersectional
analyses, where multiple sensitive attributes are considered jointly, giving
rise to a larger number of smaller groups. As these groups become more
granular, the data representing them becomes too sparse for reliable
estimation, and fairness metrics yield excessively wide confidence intervals,
precluding meaningful conclusions about potential unfair treatments.
  In this paper, we introduce a unified, size-adaptive, hypothesis-testing
framework that turns fairness assessment into an evidence-based statistical
decision. Our contribution is twofold. (i) For sufficiently large subgroups, we
prove a Central-Limit result for the statistical parity difference, leading to
analytic confidence intervals and a Wald test whose type-I (false positive)
error is guaranteed at level $\alpha$. (ii) For the long tail of small
intersectional groups, we derive a fully Bayesian Dirichlet-multinomial
estimator; Monte-Carlo credible intervals are calibrated for any sample size
and naturally converge to Wald intervals as more data becomes available. We
validate our approach empirically on benchmark datasets, demonstrating how our
tests provide interpretable, statistically rigorous decisions under varying
degrees of data availability and intersectionality.

TL;DR: 本文通过利用mixability概念，改进了非平稳在线学习中动态遗憾的界限，特别是针对具有更强曲率的损失函数（如平方或逻辑损失）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态遗憾最小化研究主要集中在凸函数上，而具有更强曲率的函数（如平方或逻辑损失）尚未充分探索。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用指数权重方法结合固定共享更新，利用mixability性质简化分析框架。

Result: 证明了对于mixable损失，动态遗憾界限为$\mathcal{O}(d T^{1/3} P_T^{2/3} \log T)$，优于现有结果。

Conclusion: 通过mixability性质，本文提供了一个简单而强大的分析框架，显著改进了动态遗憾界限。

Abstract: Non-stationary online learning has drawn much attention in recent years.
Despite considerable progress, dynamic regret minimization has primarily
focused on convex functions, leaving the functions with stronger curvature
(e.g., squared or logistic loss) underexplored. In this work, we address this
gap by showing that the regret can be substantially improved by leveraging the
concept of mixability, a property that generalizes exp-concavity to effectively
capture loss curvature. Let $d$ denote the dimensionality and $P_T$ the path
length of comparators that reflects the environmental non-stationarity. We
demonstrate that an exponential-weight method with fixed-share updates achieves
an $\mathcal{O}(d T^{1/3} P_T^{2/3} \log T)$ dynamic regret for mixable losses,
improving upon the best-known $\mathcal{O}(d^{10/3} T^{1/3} P_T^{2/3} \log T)$
result (Baby and Wang, 2021) in $d$. More importantly, this improvement arises
from a simple yet powerful analytical framework that exploits the mixability,
which avoids the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker-based analysis required by existing work.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种两阶段方法，用于准确数字化受信号重叠影响的单导联心电图记录，显著提升了现有技术的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在处理信号重叠的单导联心电图记录时的不足，提升数字化精度。

Method: 采用两阶段流程：1) 使用U-Net分割网络隔离主要ECG信号；2) 通过自适应网格检测模块将二进制掩码转换为时间序列信号。

Result: U-Net的IoU为0.87；数字化方法在非重叠和重叠信号上均优于基线（MSE和Pearson相关系数显著提升）。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了心电图记录的数字化精度，尤其是在信号重叠情况下，为研究和临床应用提供了可靠工具。

Abstract: This paper addresses the persistent challenge of accurately digitizing
paper-based electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings, with a particular focus on
robustly handling single leads compromised by signal overlaps-a common yet
under-addressed issue in existing methodologies. We propose a two-stage
pipeline designed to overcome this limitation. The first stage employs a U-Net
based segmentation network, trained on a dataset enriched with overlapping
signals and fortified with custom data augmentations, to accurately isolate the
primary ECG trace. The subsequent stage converts this refined binary mask into
a time-series signal using established digitization techniques, enhanced by an
adaptive grid detection module for improved versatility across different ECG
formats and scales. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our
approach. The U-Net architecture achieves an IoU of 0.87 for the fine-grained
segmentation task. Crucially, our proposed digitization method yields superior
performance compared to a well-established baseline technique across both
non-overlapping and challenging overlapping ECG samples. For non-overlapping
signals, our method achieved a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.0010 and a Pearson
Correlation Coefficient (rho) of 0.9644, compared to 0.0015 and 0.9366,
respectively, for the baseline. On samples with signal overlap, our method
achieved an MSE of 0.0029 and a rho of 0.9641, significantly improving upon the
baseline's 0.0178 and 0.8676. This work demonstrates an effective strategy to
significantly enhance digitization accuracy, especially in the presence of
signal overlaps, thereby laying a strong foundation for the reliable conversion
of analog ECG records into analyzable digital data for contemporary research
and clinical applications. The implementation is publicly available at this
GitHub repository: https://github.com/masoudrahimi39/ECG-code.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于低秩分解的图学习方法，通过黎曼优化技术解决高维问题，并在实验中验证了其高效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从节点数据学习无向图时的高维问题，传统方法在变量数量大时难以扩展。

Method: 利用条件相关矩阵的低秩分解，结合黎曼优化技术，提出了一种低秩约束的GLasso算法变体。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在合成和真实数据上实现了高效的维度与性能权衡。

Conclusion: 提出的低秩图学习方法在高维场景下具有显著优势，为图信号处理提供了新思路。

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of learning an undirected graph from data
gathered at each nodes. Within the graph signal processing framework, the
topology of such graph can be linked to the support of the conditional
correlation matrix of the data. The corresponding graph learning problem then
scales to the squares of the number of variables (nodes), which is usually
problematic at large dimension. To tackle this issue, we propose a graph
learning framework that leverages a low-rank factorization of the conditional
correlation matrix. In order to solve for the resulting optimization problems,
we derive tools required to apply Riemannian optimization techniques for this
particular structure. The proposal is then particularized to a low-rank
constrained counterpart of the GLasso algorithm, i.e., the penalized maximum
likelihood estimation of a Gaussian graphical model. Experiments on synthetic
and real data evidence that a very efficient dimension-versus-performance
trade-off can be achieved with this approach.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的理论分析，指出MISL方法在无监督强化学习中缺乏对技能多样性和可分性的理论保证，并提出了一种新的解耦度量LSEPIN。进一步，通过信息几何分析，提出了基于Wasserstein距离的新目标WSEP，并证明了其对下游任务适应的有效性。最后，提出了PWSEP算法，理论上可以发现所有最优初始策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MISL方法在无监督强化学习中缺乏对技能多样性和可分性的理论分析，且无法保证这些性质对下游任务适应的重要性。

Method: 提出了解耦度量LSEPIN，并通过信息几何分析将KL散度替换为Wasserstein距离，提出了新的技能学习目标WSEP和算法PWSEP。

Result: WSEP和PWSEP在理论上对下游任务适应更有效，且能发现更多初始策略。

Conclusion: 基于Wasserstein距离的方法（WSEP和PWSEP）在无监督强化学习中优于MISL，能更好地支持下游任务适应。

Abstract: Unsupervised reinforcement learning (URL) aims to learn general skills for
unseen downstream tasks. Mutual Information Skill Learning (MISL) addresses URL
by maximizing the mutual information between states and skills but lacks
sufficient theoretical analysis, e.g., how well its learned skills can
initialize a downstream task's policy. Our new theoretical analysis in this
paper shows that the diversity and separability of learned skills are
fundamentally critical to downstream task adaptation but MISL does not
necessarily guarantee these properties. To complement MISL, we propose a novel
disentanglement metric LSEPIN. Moreover, we build an information-geometric
connection between LSEPIN and downstream task adaptation cost. For better
geometric properties, we investigate a new strategy that replaces the KL
divergence in information geometry with Wasserstein distance. We extend the
geometric analysis to it, which leads to a novel skill-learning objective WSEP.
It is theoretically justified to be helpful to downstream task adaptation and
it is capable of discovering more initial policies for downstream tasks than
MISL. We finally propose another Wasserstein distance-based algorithm PWSEP
that can theoretically discover all optimal initial policies.

*Yucong Luo,Yitong Zhou,Mingyue Cheng,Jiahao Wang,Daoyu Wang,Tingyue Pan,Jintao Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出Time-R1框架，通过两阶段强化微调提升LLMs在时间序列预测中的多步推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列预测方法缺乏显式推理过程，而LLMs的多步推理能力为解决这一问题提供了可能，但提示工程存在计算成本高、隐私风险等问题。

Method: 提出Time-R1框架，包括监督微调阶段和强化学习阶段，设计了细粒度多目标奖励和GRIP方法优化推理路径。

Result: 实验表明Time-R1在多个数据集上显著提升了预测性能。

Conclusion: Time-R1通过强化微调成功增强了LLMs的时间序列推理能力，为时间序列预测提供了新思路。

Abstract: To advance time series forecasting (TSF), various methods have been proposed
to improve prediction accuracy, evolving from statistical techniques to
data-driven deep learning architectures. Despite their effectiveness, most
existing methods still adhere to a fast thinking paradigm-relying on extracting
historical patterns and mapping them to future values as their core modeling
philosophy, lacking an explicit thinking process that incorporates intermediate
time series reasoning. Meanwhile, emerging slow-thinking LLMs (e.g., OpenAI-o1)
have shown remarkable multi-step reasoning capabilities, offering an
alternative way to overcome these issues. However, prompt engineering alone
presents several limitations - including high computational cost, privacy
risks, and limited capacity for in-depth domain-specific time series reasoning.
To address these limitations, a more promising approach is to train LLMs to
develop slow thinking capabilities and acquire strong time series reasoning
skills. For this purpose, we propose Time-R1, a two-stage reinforcement
fine-tuning framework designed to enhance multi-step reasoning ability of LLMs
for time series forecasting. Specifically, the first stage conducts supervised
fine-tuning for warmup adaptation, while the second stage employs reinforcement
learning to improve the model's generalization ability. Particularly, we design
a fine-grained multi-objective reward specifically for time series forecasting,
and then introduce GRIP (group-based relative importance for policy
optimization), which leverages non-uniform sampling to further encourage and
optimize the model's exploration of effective reasoning paths. Experiments
demonstrate that Time-R1 significantly improves forecast performance across
diverse datasets.

*Alexander Lobashev,Dmitry Guskov,Maria Larchenko,Mikhail Tamm*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新方法，通过重建Fisher信息度量来分析生成模型的潜在空间几何结构，包括统计物理模型和扩散模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究生成模型潜在空间的几何结构，特别是扩散模型中相变现象的表现。

Method: 通过近似潜在变量的后验分布，学习对数配分函数，从而定义Fisher度量。

Result: 在Ising和TASEP模型上验证了方法的有效性，并揭示了扩散模型中相变的复杂结构。

Conclusion: 该方法为理解扩散模型潜在空间的复杂结构及其与相变现象的联系提供了新视角。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for analyzing the latent space geometry of
generative models, including statistical physics models and diffusion models,
by reconstructing the Fisher information metric. The method approximates the
posterior distribution of latent variables given generated samples and uses
this to learn the log-partition function, which defines the Fisher metric for
exponential families. Theoretical convergence guarantees are provided, and the
method is validated on the Ising and TASEP models, outperforming existing
baselines in reconstructing thermodynamic quantities. Applied to diffusion
models, the method reveals a fractal structure of phase transitions in the
latent space, characterized by abrupt changes in the Fisher metric. We
demonstrate that while geodesic interpolations are approximately linear within
individual phases, this linearity breaks down at phase boundaries, where the
diffusion model exhibits a divergent Lipschitz constant with respect to the
latent space. These findings provide new insights into the complex structure of
diffusion model latent spaces and their connection to phenomena like phase
transitions. Our source code is available at

### [260] [Data Shifts Hurt CoT: A Theoretical Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10647)
*Lang Yin,Debangshu Banerjee,Gagandeep Singh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoT提升LLM输出质量，但在数据分布偏移和污染下，其表现可能比直接预测更差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究数据分布偏移和污染对CoT在解决$k$-parity问题中的影响。

Method: 分析CoT分解在$k$-parity问题中的表现，结合分布偏移和数据污染。

Result: CoT在数据偏移和污染下表现更差，揭示了其机制原因。

Conclusion: CoT在现实数据中的局限性需进一步研究。

Abstract: Chain of Thought (CoT) has been applied to various large language models
(LLMs) and proven to be effective in improving the quality of outputs. In
recent studies, transformers are proven to have absolute upper bounds in terms
of expressive power, and consequently, they cannot solve many computationally
difficult problems. However, empowered by CoT, transformers are proven to be
able to solve some difficult problems effectively, such as the $k$-parity
problem. Nevertheless, those works rely on two imperative assumptions: (1)
identical training and testing distribution, and (2) corruption-free training
data with correct reasoning steps. However, in the real world, these
assumptions do not always hold. Although the risks of data shifts have caught
attention, our work is the first to rigorously study the exact harm caused by
such shifts to the best of our knowledge. Focusing on the $k$-parity problem,
in this work we investigate the joint impact of two types of data shifts: the
distribution shifts and data poisoning, on the quality of trained models
obtained by a well-established CoT decomposition. In addition to revealing a
surprising phenomenon that CoT leads to worse performance on learning parity
than directly generating the prediction, our technical results also give a
rigorous and comprehensive explanation of the mechanistic reasons of such
impact.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SatSOM的自组织映射扩展方法，通过饱和机制减少神经元的学习率和邻域半径，以改善持续学习中的知识保留问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自组织映射在持续学习场景中因灾难性遗忘导致的知识保留问题。

Method: 引入饱和机制，动态调整神经元的学习率和邻域半径，冻结已训练好的神经元并引导学习到未充分利用的区域。

Result: SatSOM能有效减少灾难性遗忘，提升知识保留能力。

Conclusion: SatSOM为自组织映射在持续学习中的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Continual learning poses a fundamental challenge for neural systems, which
often suffer from catastrophic forgetting when exposed to sequential tasks.
Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs), despite their interpretability and efficiency, are
not immune to this issue. In this paper, we introduce Saturation
Self-Organizing Maps (SatSOM)-an extension of SOMs designed to improve
knowledge retention in continual learning scenarios. SatSOM incorporates a
novel saturation mechanism that gradually reduces the learning rate and
neighborhood radius of neurons as they accumulate information. This effectively
freezes well-trained neurons and redirects learning to underutilized areas of
the map.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPLICE是一种通过斜投影移除敏感概念并保留标签协方差的方法，优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代神经网络常编码无用概念，影响公平性和可解释性，现有方法可能损害有用信号。

Method: SPLICE通过斜投影移除敏感概念，同时精确保留其与目标标签的协方差。

Result: 在Bias in Bios和Winobias等基准测试中，SPLICE优于基线，移除受保护属性且最小化主任务信息损失。

Conclusion: SPLICE是唯一能移除线性概念预测性并保持目标协方差的解决方案，具有理论和实证优势。

Abstract: Modern neural networks often encode unwanted concepts alongside task-relevant
information, leading to fairness and interpretability concerns. Existing
post-hoc approaches can remove undesired concepts but often degrade useful
signals. We introduce SPLICE-Simultaneous Projection for LInear concept removal
and Covariance prEservation-which eliminates sensitive concepts from
representations while exactly preserving their covariance with a target label.
SPLICE achieves this via an oblique projection that "splices out" the unwanted
direction yet protects important label correlations. Theoretically, it is the
unique solution that removes linear concept predictability and maintains target
covariance with minimal embedding distortion. Empirically, SPLICE outperforms
baselines on benchmarks such as Bias in Bios and Winobias, removing protected
attributes while minimally damaging main-task information.

TL;DR: ConTextTab结合了表格原生ICL框架与语义理解，通过多模态嵌入和真实数据训练，在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有表格原生ICL架构仅依赖合成数据，未能充分利用真实数据的语义；而基于大语言模型的ICL模型受限于架构，无法处理大量上下文。

Method: 引入ConTextTab，结合语义理解与表格原生ICL框架，采用多模态嵌入并基于大规模真实数据训练。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，并在语义丰富的CARTE基准上创下新纪录。

Conclusion: ConTextTab成功整合了语义理解与表格原生ICL的优势，为表格预测任务提供了高效且语义丰富的解决方案。

Abstract: Tabular in-context learning (ICL) has recently achieved state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance on several tabular prediction tasks. Previously restricted
to classification problems on small tables, recent advances such as TabPFN and
TabICL have extended its use to larger datasets. While being architecturally
efficient and well-adapted to tabular data structures, current table-native ICL
architectures, being trained exclusively on synthetic data, do not fully
leverage the rich semantics and world knowledge contained in real-world tabular
data. On another end of this spectrum, tabular ICL models based on pretrained
large language models such as TabuLa-8B integrate deep semantic understanding
and world knowledge but are only able to make use of a small amount of context
due to inherent architectural limitations. With the aim to combine the best of
both these worlds, we introduce ConTextTab, integrating semantic understanding
and alignment into a table-native ICL framework. By employing specialized
embeddings for different data modalities and by training on large-scale
real-world tabular data, our model is competitive with SOTA across a broad set
of benchmarks while setting a new standard on the semantically rich CARTE
benchmark.

Motivation: 解决临床QA中精确证据检索和可靠答案生成的挑战，尤其是在监督有限的情况下。

Method: 将任务分为句子级证据识别和带引用的答案合成，利用DSPy的MIPROv2优化器自动探索提示空间，并通过自一致性投票提升证据召回率。

Result: 在BioNLP 2025 ArchEHR-QA任务中排名第二，测试集得分为51.5，显著优于零样本和少样本提示方法。

Conclusion: 数据驱动的提示优化是模型微调的高效替代方案，提升了医疗AI助手的可靠性。

Abstract: Automated question answering (QA) over electronic health records (EHRs) can
bridge critical information gaps for clinicians and patients, yet it demands
both precise evidence retrieval and faithful answer generation under limited
supervision. In this work, we present Neural, the runner-up in the BioNLP 2025
ArchEHR-QA shared task on evidence-grounded clinical QA. Our proposed method
decouples the task into (1) sentence-level evidence identification and (2)
answer synthesis with explicit citations. For each stage, we automatically
explore the prompt space with DSPy's MIPROv2 optimizer, jointly tuning
instructions and few-shot demonstrations on the development set. A
self-consistency voting scheme further improves evidence recall without
sacrificing precision. On the hidden test set, our method attains an overall
score of 51.5, placing second stage while outperforming standard zero-shot and
few-shot prompting by over 20 and 10 points, respectively. These results
indicate that data-driven prompt optimization is a cost-effective alternative
to model fine-tuning for high-stakes clinical QA, advancing the reliability of
AI assistants in healthcare.

Result: FGN在多种确定性和概率性指标上表现优异，能准确预测热带气旋路径，并捕捉空间结构。

Conclusion: FGN是一种高效的集合预报方法，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML)-based weather models have rapidly risen to prominence
due to their greater accuracy and speed than traditional forecasts based on
numerical weather prediction (NWP), recently outperforming traditional
ensembles in global probabilistic weather forecasting. This paper presents FGN,
a simple, scalable and flexible modeling approach which significantly
outperforms the current state-of-the-art models. FGN generates ensembles via
learned model-perturbations with an ensemble of appropriately constrained
models. It is trained directly to minimize the continuous rank probability
score (CRPS) of per-location forecasts. It produces state-of-the-art ensemble
forecasts as measured by a range of deterministic and probabilistic metrics,
makes skillful ensemble tropical cyclone track predictions, and captures joint
spatial structure despite being trained only on marginals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在单调分类中，如何以最小的成本（即揭示标签的点数）找到接近最优误差的分类器。

Method: 提出了新的算法，能够在误差允许相对超过最优值的情况下，最小化揭示标签的点数。

Result: 给出了几乎匹配的上界和下界，覆盖了所有可能的$\epsilon$范围。

Conclusion: 这是首次在单调分类中实现相对误差控制的研究，填补了此前仅能控制绝对误差的空白。

Abstract: In monotone classification, the input is a multi-set $P$ of points in
$\mathbb{R}^d$, each associated with a hidden label from $\{-1, 1\}$. The goal
is to identify a monotone function $h$, which acts as a classifier, mapping
from $\mathbb{R}^d$ to $\{-1, 1\}$ with a small {\em error}, measured as the
number of points $p \in P$ whose labels differ from the function values $h(p)$.
The cost of an algorithm is defined as the number of points having their labels
revealed. This article presents the first study on the lowest cost required to
find a monotone classifier whose error is at most $(1 + \epsilon) \cdot k^*$
where $\epsilon \ge 0$ and $k^*$ is the minimum error achieved by an optimal
monotone classifier -- in other words, the error is allowed to exceed the
optimal by at most a relative factor. Nearly matching upper and lower bounds
are presented for the full range of $\epsilon$. All previous work on the
problem can only achieve an error higher than the optimal by an absolute
factor.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的能量函数log-sum-ReLU（LSR），用于Dense Associative Memory网络，基于Epanechnikov核，具有指数容量和精确记忆检索能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统log-sum-exponential（LSE）函数需要指数分离函数，而LSR无需此条件，同时引入新的局部极小值，保留完美模式恢复特性。

Method: 基于Epanechnikov核设计LSR能量函数，通过实验验证其性能。

Result: LSR具有更多局部极小值（记忆），且与LSE模型相比具有相似的对数似然。在图像数据集上表现出创造性和新颖性。

Conclusion: LSR在大型记忆存储和生成任务中具有潜力。

Abstract: We propose a novel energy function for Dense Associative Memory (DenseAM)
networks, the log-sum-ReLU (LSR), inspired by optimal kernel density
estimation. Unlike the common log-sum-exponential (LSE) function, LSR is based
on the Epanechnikov kernel and enables exact memory retrieval with exponential
capacity without requiring exponential separation functions. Moreover, it
introduces abundant additional \emph{emergent} local minima while preserving
perfect pattern recovery -- a characteristic previously unseen in DenseAM
literature. Empirical results show that LSR energy has significantly more local
minima (memories) that have comparable log-likelihood to LSE-based models.
Analysis of LSR's emergent memories on image datasets reveals a degree of
creativity and novelty, hinting at this method's potential for both large-scale
memory storage and generative tasks.

Result: 探针性能接近中型LLM监控器，计算成本降低六个数量级，支持构建分层监控系统。

Conclusion: 激活探针是高效监控高风险交互的可行方案，未来可进一步研究分层系统。

Abstract: Monitoring is an important aspect of safely deploying Large Language Models
(LLMs). This paper examines activation probes for detecting "high-stakes"
interactions -- where the text indicates that the interaction might lead to
significant harm -- as a critical, yet underexplored, target for such
monitoring. We evaluate several probe architectures trained on synthetic data,
and find them to exhibit robust generalization to diverse, out-of-distribution,
real-world data. Probes' performance is comparable to that of prompted or
finetuned medium-sized LLM monitors, while offering computational savings of
six orders-of-magnitude. Our experiments also highlight the potential of
building resource-aware hierarchical monitoring systems, where probes serve as
an efficient initial filter and flag cases for more expensive downstream
analysis. We release our novel synthetic dataset and codebase to encourage
further study.

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了动态深度学习系统（DDLSs）的效率鲁棒性，首次提出了效率攻击的综合分类，并分析了现有防御机制的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态深度学习系统（DDLSs）通过动态调整推理计算提高效率，但也引入了新的攻击面，效率对抗攻击利用这些动态机制降低系统性能。

Method: 通过深入研究，分类了基于三种动态行为的效率攻击：（i）动态计算攻击，（ii）动态迭代攻击，（iii）动态输出攻击。

Result: 分析了针对DDLSs效率的对抗策略，揭示了现有防御机制的不足。

Conclusion: 未来需要新的缓解策略来保护适应性强的DDLSs。

Abstract: Deep Learning Systems (DLSs) are increasingly deployed in real-time
applications, including those in resourceconstrained environments such as
mobile and IoT devices. To address efficiency challenges, Dynamic Deep Learning
Systems (DDLSs) adapt inference computation based on input complexity, reducing
overhead. While this dynamic behavior improves efficiency, such behavior
introduces new attack surfaces. In particular, efficiency adversarial attacks
exploit these dynamic mechanisms to degrade system performance. This paper
systematically explores efficiency robustness of DDLSs, presenting the first
comprehensive taxonomy of efficiency attacks. We categorize these attacks based
on three dynamic behaviors: (i) attacks on dynamic computations per inference,
(ii) attacks on dynamic inference iterations, and (iii) attacks on dynamic
output production for downstream tasks. Through an in-depth evaluation, we
analyze adversarial strategies that target DDLSs efficiency and identify key
challenges in securing these systems. In addition, we investigate existing
defense mechanisms, demonstrating their limitations against increasingly
popular efficiency attacks and the necessity for novel mitigation strategies to
secure future adaptive DDLSs.

Abstract: The rise of digital payments has accelerated the need for intelligent and
scalable systems to detect fraud. This research presents an end-to-end,
feature-rich machine learning framework for detecting credit card transaction
anomalies and fraud using real-world data. The study begins by merging
transactional, cardholder, merchant, and merchant category datasets from a
relational database to create a unified analytical view. Through the feature
engineering process, we extract behavioural signals such as average spending,
deviation from historical patterns, transaction timing irregularities, and
category frequency metrics. These features are enriched with temporal markers
such as hour, day of week, and weekend indicators to expose all latent patterns
that indicate fraudulent behaviours. Exploratory data analysis reveals
contextual transaction trends across all the dataset features. Using the
transactional data, we train and evaluate a range of unsupervised models:
Isolation Forest, One Class SVM, and a deep autoencoder trained to reconstruct
normal behavior. These models flag the top 1% of reconstruction errors as
outliers. PCA visualizations illustrate each models ability to separate
anomalies into a two-dimensional latent space. We further segment the
transaction landscape using K-Means clustering and DBSCAN to identify dense
clusters of normal activity and isolate sparse, suspicious regions.

*Pierre-François Massiani,Alexander von Rohr,Lukas Haverbeck,Sebastian Trimpe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何在未知干扰下通过熵正则化和约束惩罚实现强化学习的鲁棒安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管强化学习（RL）近期取得进展，但在未知干扰下学习满足状态约束的策略仍是一个开放问题。

Method: 通过分析熵正则化和约束惩罚的相互作用，提出了一种将严格安全约束松弛为惩罚的方法，从而用标准无约束RL近似求解。

Result: 实验表明，熵正则化能促进鲁棒约束满足，而松弛约束的方法在保持安全性和最优性的同时提高了对干扰的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 熵正则化与鲁棒性的联系为RL中的鲁棒安全性提供了一种简单奖励塑形的新途径。

Abstract: Despite the many recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL), the question
of learning policies that robustly satisfy state constraints under unknown
disturbances remains open. In this paper, we offer a new perspective on
achieving robust safety by analyzing the interplay between two well-established
techniques in model-free RL: entropy regularization, and constraints
penalization. We reveal empirically that entropy regularization in constrained
RL inherently biases learning toward maximizing the number of future viable
actions, thereby promoting constraints satisfaction robust to action noise.
Furthermore, we show that by relaxing strict safety constraints through
penalties, the constrained RL problem can be approximated arbitrarily closely
by an unconstrained one and thus solved using standard model-free RL. This
reformulation preserves both safety and optimality while empirically improving
resilience to disturbances. Our results indicate that the connection between
entropy regularization and robustness is a promising avenue for further
empirical and theoretical investigation, as it enables robust safety in RL
through simple reward shaping.

Motivation: 分类器混合物（随机集成）被提出以提高对抗攻击的鲁棒性，但现有攻击方法不适用于此类分类器。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过几何分析提出攻击的两个理想属性，并设计了一种新的攻击方法（lattice climber attack），在二元线性设置下提供理论保证。

Conclusion: lattice climber attack 是一种有效的攻击分类器混合物的方法，填补了现有攻击方法的不足。

Abstract: Finite mixtures of classifiers (a.k.a. randomized ensembles) have been
proposed as a way to improve robustness against adversarial attacks. However,
existing attacks have been shown to not suit this kind of classifier. In this
paper, we discuss the problem of attacking a mixture in a principled way and
introduce two desirable properties of attacks based on a geometrical analysis
of the problem (effectiveness and maximality). We then show that existing
attacks do not meet both of these properties. Finally, we introduce a new
attack called {\em lattice climber attack} with theoretical guarantees in the
binary linear setting, and demonstrate its performance by conducting
experiments on synthetic and real datasets.

Conclusion: Duo方法通过结合高斯扩散技术，显著提升了均匀状态扩散模型的性能，为快速文本生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Uniform-state discrete diffusion models hold the promise of fast text
generation due to their inherent ability to self-correct. However, they are
typically outperformed by autoregressive models and masked diffusion models. In
this work, we narrow this performance gap by leveraging a key insight:
Uniform-state diffusion processes naturally emerge from an underlying Gaussian
diffusion. Our method, Duo, transfers powerful techniques from Gaussian
diffusion to improve both training and sampling. First, we introduce a
curriculum learning strategy guided by the Gaussian process, doubling training
speed by reducing variance. Models trained with curriculum learning surpass
autoregressive models in zero-shot perplexity on 3 of 7 benchmarks. Second, we
present Discrete Consistency Distillation, which adapts consistency
distillation from the continuous to the discrete setting. This algorithm
unlocks few-step generation in diffusion language models by accelerating
sampling by two orders of magnitude. We provide the code and model checkpoints

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为NoLoCo的新型优化方法，通过部分随机平均模型权重，避免了显式同步参数，显著减少了通信开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模语言模型训练通常需要高带宽互联的计算集群，成本高昂且扩展性受限。现有低通信训练方法仍需同步参数，在低带宽网络中效率低下。

Method: NoLoCo采用Nesterov动量优化器的变体，通过随机选择部分模型权重进行平均，实现隐式同步，无需集体通信。

Result: 实验表明，NoLoCo在125M至6.8B参数的模型上，通信开销显著低于现有方法，同步速度更快，收敛速度提升4%。

Conclusion: NoLoCo为低带宽网络中的大规模模型训练提供了高效解决方案，减少了通信成本和加速器闲置时间。

Abstract: Training large language models is generally done via optimization methods on
clusters containing tens of thousands of accelerators, communicating over a
high-bandwidth interconnect. Scaling up these clusters is expensive and can
become impractical, imposing limits on the size of models that can be trained.
Several recent studies have proposed training methods that are less
communication intensive, avoiding the need for a highly connected compute
cluster. These state-of-the-art low communication training methods still employ
a synchronization step for model parameters, which, when performed over all
model replicas, can become costly on a low-bandwidth network.
  In this work, we propose a novel optimization method, NoLoCo, that does not
explicitly synchronize all model parameters during training and, as a result,
does not require any collective communication. NoLoCo implicitly synchronizes
model weights via a novel variant of the Nesterov momentum optimizer by
partially averaging model weights with a randomly selected other one. We
provide both a theoretical convergence analysis for our proposed optimizer as
well as empirical results from language model training.
  We benchmark NoLoCo on a wide range of accelerator counts and model sizes,
between 125M to 6.8B parameters. Our method requires significantly less
communication overhead than fully sharded data parallel training or even widely
used low communication training method, DiLoCo. The synchronization step itself
is estimated to be one magnitude faster than the all-reduce used in DiLoCo for
few hundred accelerators training over the internet. We also do not have any
global blocking communication that reduces accelerator idling time. Compared to
DiLoCo, we also observe up to $4\%$ faster convergence rate with wide range of
model sizes and accelerator counts.

Result: CausalFM在条件平均处理效应估计中表现优异，适用于合成和半合成基准测试。

Conclusion: CausalFM为因果推断提供通用框架，有望改变实践中的因果推断方式。

Abstract: Prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) have recently been proposed as a promising
way to train tabular foundation models. PFNs are transformers that are
pre-trained on synthetic data generated from a prespecified prior distribution
and that enable Bayesian inference through in-context learning. In this paper,
we introduce CausalFM, a comprehensive framework for training PFN-based
foundation models in various causal inference settings. First, we formalize the
construction of Bayesian priors for causal inference based on structural causal
models (SCMs) in a principled way and derive necessary criteria for the
validity of such priors. Building on this, we propose a novel family of prior
distributions using causality-inspired Bayesian neural networks that enable
CausalFM to perform Bayesian causal inference in various settings, including
back-door, front-door, and instrumental variable adjustment. Finally, we
instantiate CausalFM and explicitly train a foundation model for estimating
conditional average treatment effects (CATEs) using back-door adjustment. We
show that CausalFM performs competitively for CATE estimation using various
synthetic and semi-synthetic benchmarks. In sum, our framework can be used as a
general recipe to train foundation models for various causal inference
settings. In contrast to the current state-of-the-art in causal inference,
CausalFM offers a novel paradigm with the potential to fundamentally change how
practitioners perform causal inference in medicine, economics, and other
disciplines.

Conclusion: PSMs为神经序列模型提供了一种通用框架，兼具表达能力和效率，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Modern neural sequence models are designed to meet the dual mandate of
parallelizable training and fast sequential inference. Recent developments have
given rise to various models, such as Gated Linear Attention (GLA) and Mamba,
that achieve such ``sequential-parallel duality.'' This raises a natural
question: can we characterize the full class of neural sequence models that
support near-constant-time parallel evaluation and linear-time, constant-space
sequential inference? We begin by describing a broad class of such models --
state space models -- as those whose state updates can be computed using the
classic parallel prefix scan algorithm with a custom associative aggregation
operator. We then define a more general class, Prefix-Scannable Models (PSMs),
by relaxing the state aggregation operator to allow arbitrary (potentially
non-associative) functions such as softmax attention. This generalization
unifies many existing architectures, including element-wise RNNs (e.g., Mamba)
and linear transformers (e.g., GLA, Mamba2, mLSTM), while also introducing new
models with softmax-like operators that achieve O(1) amortized compute per
token and log(N) memory for sequence length N. We empirically evaluate such
models on illustrative small-scale language modeling and canonical synthetic
tasks, including state tracking and associative recall. Empirically, we find
that PSMs retain the expressivity of transformer-based architectures while
matching the inference efficiency of state space models -- in some cases
exhibiting better length generalization than either.

Motivation: LLM在招聘等高风险应用中的偏见问题可能对职业和生计产生直接影响，需探索更有效的偏见缓解策略。

Method: 通过识别并中和模型激活中的敏感属性方向，采用内部偏见缓解方法，在推理时应用仿射概念编辑。

Result: 在引入现实细节后，模型表现出显著的种族和性别偏见（面试率差异高达12%）。内部缓解方法将偏见降至1%以下，同时保持模型性能。

Conclusion: 建议采用更现实的评估方法，并部署内部偏见缓解策略，以确保LLM在招聘中的公平性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes hiring
applications, making decisions that directly impact people's careers and
livelihoods. While prior studies suggest simple anti-bias prompts can eliminate
demographic biases in controlled evaluations, we find these mitigations fail
when realistic contextual details are introduced. We address these failures
through internal bias mitigation: by identifying and neutralizing sensitive
attribute directions within model activations, we achieve robust bias reduction
across all tested scenarios. Across leading commercial (GPT-4o, Claude 4
Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Flash) and open-source models (Gemma-2 27B, Gemma-3,
Mistral-24B), we find that adding realistic context such as company names,
culture descriptions from public careers pages, and selective hiring
constraints (e.g.,``only accept candidates in the top 10\%") induces
significant racial and gender biases (up to 12\% differences in interview
rates). When these biases emerge, they consistently favor Black over White
candidates and female over male candidates across all tested models and
scenarios. Moreover, models can infer demographics and become biased from
subtle cues like college affiliations, with these biases remaining invisible
even when inspecting the model's chain-of-thought reasoning. To address these
limitations, our internal bias mitigation identifies race and gender-correlated
directions and applies affine concept editing at inference time. Despite using
directions from a simple synthetic dataset, the intervention generalizes
robustly, consistently reducing bias to very low levels (typically under 1\%,
always below 2.5\%) while largely maintaining model performance. Our findings
suggest that practitioners deploying LLMs for hiring should adopt more
realistic evaluation methodologies and consider internal mitigation strategies
for equitable outcomes.

Conclusion: SEAL是实现语言模型自我适应能力的重要进展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are powerful but static; they lack mechanisms to
adapt their weights in response to new tasks, knowledge, or examples. We
introduce Self-Adapting LLMs (SEAL), a framework that enables LLMs to
self-adapt by generating their own finetuning data and update directives. Given
a new input, the model produces a self-edit-a generation that may restructure
the information in different ways, specify optimization hyperparameters, or
invoke tools for data augmentation and gradient-based updates. Through
supervised finetuning (SFT), these self-edits result in persistent weight
updates, enabling lasting adaptation. To train the model to produce effective
self-edits, we use a reinforcement learning loop with the downstream
performance of the updated model as the reward signal. Unlike prior approaches
that rely on separate adaptation modules or auxiliary networks, SEAL directly
uses the model's own generation to control its adaptation process. Experiments
on knowledge incorporation and few-shot generalization show that SEAL is a
promising step toward language models capable of self-directed adaptation. Our
website and code is available at https://jyopari.github.io/posts/seal.

Motivation: 解决LLM遗忘学习中的无意遗忘问题，提升模型在合规、版权和隐私需求下的实用性。

Method: 提出轻量级代理数据归因指标，设计自适应非均匀遗忘权重分配目标。

Result: 在TOFU基准测试中，GUARD显著提升保留性能，减少效用损失达194.92%。

Conclusion: GUARD有效平衡遗忘与保留，为LLM遗忘学习提供新方向。

Abstract: Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is becoming increasingly important
due to regulatory compliance, copyright protection, and privacy concerns.
However, a key challenge in LLM unlearning is unintended forgetting, where the
removal of specific data inadvertently impairs the utility of the model and its
retention of valuable, desired information. While prior work has primarily
focused on architectural innovations, the influence of data-level factors on
unlearning performance remains underexplored. As a result, existing methods
often suffer from degraded retention when forgetting high-impact data. To
address this, we propose GUARD-a novel framework for Guided Unlearning And
Retention via Data attribution. At its core, GUARD introduces a lightweight
proxy data attribution metric tailored for LLM unlearning, which quantifies the
"alignment" between the forget and retain sets while remaining computationally
efficient. Building on this, we design a novel unlearning objective that
assigns adaptive, nonuniform unlearning weights to samples, inversely
proportional to their proxy attribution scores. Through such a reallocation of
unlearning power, GUARD mitigates unintended losses in retention. We provide
rigorous theoretical guarantees that GUARD significantly enhances retention
while maintaining forgetting metrics comparable to prior methods. Extensive
experiments on the TOFU benchmark across multiple LLM architectures demonstrate
that GUARD substantially improves utility preservation while ensuring effective
unlearning. Notably, GUARD reduces utility sacrifice on the Retain Set by up to
194.92% in terms of Truth Ratio when forgetting 10% of the training data.

Result: EG-CFG在多样化编程任务中表现优异，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: EG-CFG通过动态执行反馈显著提升代码生成能力，支持并行探索多样化解决方案。

Abstract: We present a novel approach to neural code generation that incorporates
real-time execution signals into the language model generation process. While
large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive code generation
capabilities, they typically do not utilize execution feedback during
inference, a critical signal that human programmers regularly leverage. Our
method, Execution-Guided Classifier-Free Guidance (EG-CFG), dynamically
incorporates execution signals as the model generates code, providing
line-by-line feedback that guides the generation process toward executable
solutions. EG-CFG employs a multi-stage process: first, we conduct beam search
to sample candidate program completions for each line; second, we extract
execution signals by executing these candidates against test cases; and
finally, we incorporate these signals into the prompt during generation. By
maintaining consistent signals across tokens within the same line and
refreshing signals at line boundaries, our approach provides coherent guidance
while preserving syntactic structure. Moreover, the method naturally supports
native parallelism at the task level in which multiple agents operate in
parallel, exploring diverse reasoning paths and collectively generating a broad
set of candidate solutions. Our experiments across diverse coding tasks
demonstrate that EG-CFG significantly improves code generation performance
compared to standard approaches, achieving state-of-the-art results across
various levels of complexity, from foundational problems to challenging
competitive programming tasks. Our code is available at:

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and multimodal
counterparts have spurred significant interest in developing web agents -- AI
systems capable of autonomously navigating and completing tasks within web
environments. While holding tremendous promise for automating complex web
interactions, current approaches face substantial challenges due to the
fundamental mismatch between human-designed interfaces and LLM capabilities.
Current methods struggle with the inherent complexity of web inputs, whether
processing massive DOM trees, relying on screenshots augmented with additional
information, or bypassing the user interface entirely through API interactions.
This position paper advocates for a paradigm shift in web agent research:
rather than forcing web agents to adapt to interfaces designed for humans, we
should develop a new interaction paradigm specifically optimized for agentic
capabilities. To this end, we introduce the concept of an Agentic Web Interface
(AWI), an interface specifically designed for agents to navigate a website. We
establish six guiding principles for AWI design, emphasizing safety,
efficiency, and standardization, to account for the interests of all primary
stakeholders. This reframing aims to overcome fundamental limitations of
existing interfaces, paving the way for more efficient, reliable, and
transparent web agent design, which will be a collaborative effort involving
the broader ML community.

Result: 在困难逆问题中显著提升样本质量和测量一致性，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ReGuidance首次为DPS提供理论保证，同时提升奖励和样本真实性。

Abstract: There has been a flurry of activity around using pretrained diffusion models
as informed data priors for solving inverse problems, and more generally around
steering these models using reward models. Training-free methods like diffusion
posterior sampling (DPS) and its many variants have offered flexible heuristic
algorithms for these tasks, but when the reward is not informative enough,
e.g., in hard inverse problems with low signal-to-noise ratio, these techniques
veer off the data manifold, failing to produce realistic outputs. In this work,
we devise a simple wrapper, ReGuidance, for boosting both the sample realism
and reward achieved by these methods. Given a candidate solution $\hat{x}$
produced by an algorithm of the user's choice, we propose inverting the
solution by running the unconditional probability flow ODE in reverse starting
from $\hat{x}$, and then using the resulting latent as an initialization for
DPS. We evaluate our wrapper on hard inverse problems like large box
in-painting and super-resolution with high upscaling. Whereas state-of-the-art
baselines visibly fail, we find that applying our wrapper on top of these
baselines significantly boosts sample quality and measurement consistency. We
complement these findings with theory proving that on certain multimodal data
distributions, ReGuidance simultaneously boosts the reward and brings the
candidate solution closer to the data manifold. To our knowledge, this
constitutes the first rigorous algorithmic guarantee for DPS.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了几何在上下文学习中的作用，并为研究非线性模型的上下文学习提供了新工具。

Abstract: While in-context learning (ICL) has achieved remarkable success in natural
language and vision domains, its theoretical understanding--particularly in the
context of structured geometric data--remains unexplored. In this work, we
initiate a theoretical study of ICL for regression of H\"older functions on
manifolds. By establishing a novel connection between the attention mechanism
and classical kernel methods, we derive generalization error bounds in terms of
the prompt length and the number of training tasks. When a sufficient number of
training tasks are observed, transformers give rise to the minimax regression
rate of H\"older functions on manifolds, which scales exponentially with the
intrinsic dimension of the manifold, rather than the ambient space dimension.
Our result also characterizes how the generalization error scales with the
number of training tasks, shedding light on the complexity of transformers as
in-context algorithm learners. Our findings provide foundational insights into
the role of geometry in ICL and novels tools to study ICL of nonlinear models.

law offering enhanced predictive accuracy across scales. By systematically
constructing a model loss surface $L(N,D)$, Farseer achieves a significantly
better fit to empirical data than prior laws (e.g., Chinchilla's law). Our
methodology yields accurate, robust, and highly generalizable predictions,
demonstrating excellent extrapolation capabilities, improving upon Chinchilla's
law by reducing extrapolation error by 433\%. This allows for the reliable
evaluation of competing training strategies across all $(N,D)$ settings,
enabling conclusions from small-scale ablation studies to be confidently
extrapolated to predict large-scale performance. Furthermore, Farseer provides
new insights into optimal compute allocation, better reflecting the nuanced
demands of modern LLM training. To validate our approach, we trained an
extensive suite of approximately 1,000 LLMs across diverse scales and
configurations, consuming roughly 3 million NVIDIA H100 GPU hours. We are
comprehensively open-sourcing all models, data, results, and logs at

Abstract: A wide range of scientific problems, such as those described by
continuous-time dynamical systems and partial differential equations (PDEs),
are naturally formulated on function spaces. While function spaces are
typically infinite-dimensional, deep learning has predominantly advanced
through applications in computer vision and natural language processing that
focus on mappings between finite-dimensional spaces. Such fundamental
disparities in the nature of the data have limited neural networks from
achieving a comparable level of success in scientific applications as seen in
other fields. Neural operators are a principled way to generalize neural
networks to mappings between function spaces, offering a pathway to replicate
deep learning's transformative impact on scientific problems. For instance,
neural operators can learn solution operators for entire classes of PDEs, e.g.,
physical systems with different boundary conditions, coefficient functions, and
geometries. A key factor in deep learning's success has been the careful
engineering of neural architectures through extensive empirical testing.
Translating these neural architectures into neural operators allows operator
learning to enjoy these same empirical optimizations. However, prior neural
operator architectures have often been introduced as standalone models, not
directly derived as extensions of existing neural network architectures. In
this paper, we identify and distill the key principles for constructing
practical implementations of mappings between infinite-dimensional function
spaces. Using these principles, we propose a recipe for converting several
popular neural architectures into neural operators with minimal modifications.
This paper aims to guide practitioners through this process and details the
steps to make neural operators work in practice. Our code can be found at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究扩散桥方法中不同损失函数的性能差异，尤其是LV和rKL损失在优化目标上的区别。

Method: 通过理论分析和实验验证，比较LV损失和rKL-LD损失在扩散桥方法中的表现。

Result: 实验证明rKL-LD损失在性能和训练稳定性上优于LV损失，且需要更少的超参数优化。

Conclusion: rKL-LD损失是扩散桥方法中更优的选择，解决了LV损失的理论问题并提升了实际效果。

Abstract: Diffusion bridges are a promising class of deep-learning methods for sampling
from unnormalized distributions. Recent works show that the Log Variance (LV)
loss consistently outperforms the reverse Kullback-Leibler (rKL) loss when
using the reparametrization trick to compute rKL-gradients. While the on-policy
LV loss yields identical gradients to the rKL loss when combined with the
log-derivative trick for diffusion samplers with non-learnable forward
processes, this equivalence does not hold for diffusion bridges or when
diffusion coefficients are learned. Based on this insight we argue that for
diffusion bridges the LV loss does not represent an optimization objective that
can be motivated like the rKL loss via the data processing inequality. Our
analysis shows that employing the rKL loss with the log-derivative trick
(rKL-LD) does not only avoid these conceptual problems but also consistently
outperforms the LV loss. Experimental results with different types of diffusion
bridges on challenging benchmarks show that samplers trained with the rKL-LD
loss achieve better performance. From a practical perspective we find that
rKL-LD requires significantly less hyperparameter optimization and yields more
stable training behavior.

TL;DR: AniMaker是一个多智能体框架，通过高效生成多候选视频片段和故事感知的片段选择，解决了多场景视频生成的连贯性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频生成模型在多场景和角色转换时存在叙事不连贯和节奏问题，AniMaker旨在解决这些问题。

Method: AniMaker采用多智能体框架，包括导演、摄影、评审和后制代理，结合MCTS-Gen和AniEval技术优化生成和评估。

Result: 实验表明，AniMaker在质量和效率上均优于现有方法，并通过VBench和AniEval框架验证了其优越性。

Conclusion: AniMaker推动了AI生成故事动画向生产标准迈进，解决了多场景视频生成的挑战。

Abstract: Despite rapid advancements in video generation models, generating coherent
storytelling videos that span multiple scenes and characters remains
challenging. Current methods often rigidly convert pre-generated keyframes into
fixed-length clips, resulting in disjointed narratives and pacing issues.
Furthermore, the inherent instability of video generation models means that
even a single low-quality clip can significantly degrade the entire output
animation's logical coherence and visual continuity. To overcome these
obstacles, we introduce AniMaker, a multi-agent framework enabling efficient
multi-candidate clip generation and storytelling-aware clip selection, thus
creating globally consistent and story-coherent animation solely from text
input. The framework is structured around specialized agents, including the
Director Agent for storyboard generation, the Photography Agent for video clip
generation, the Reviewer Agent for evaluation, and the Post-Production Agent
for editing and voiceover. Central to AniMaker's approach are two key technical
components: MCTS-Gen in Photography Agent, an efficient Monte Carlo Tree Search
(MCTS)-inspired strategy that intelligently navigates the candidate space to
generate high-potential clips while optimizing resource usage; and AniEval in
Reviewer Agent, the first framework specifically designed for multi-shot
animation evaluation, which assesses critical aspects such as story-level
consistency, action completion, and animation-specific features by considering
each clip in the context of its preceding and succeeding clips. Experiments
demonstrate that AniMaker achieves superior quality as measured by popular
metrics including VBench and our proposed AniEval framework, while
significantly improving the efficiency of multi-candidate generation, pushing
AI-generated storytelling animation closer to production standards.

Result: 证明了存在高阶非耦合学习动力学可以局部收敛到孤立完全混合策略NE，但也发现学习动力学的非普适性。引入ABR属性并探讨其与NE的兼容性。

Conclusion: 论文揭示了混合策略NE的可学习性及其限制，为设计更高效的学习算法提供了理论基础。

Abstract: We study learnability of mixed-strategy Nash Equilibrium (NE) in general
finite games using higher-order replicator dynamics as well as classes of
higher-order uncoupled heterogeneous dynamics. In higher-order uncoupled
learning dynamics, players have no access to utilities of opponents (uncoupled)
but are allowed to use auxiliary states to further process information
(higher-order). We establish a link between uncoupled learning and feedback
stabilization with decentralized control. Using this association, we show that
for any finite game with an isolated completely mixed-strategy NE, there exist
higher-order uncoupled learning dynamics that lead (locally) to that NE. We
further establish the lack of universality of learning dynamics by linking
learning to the control theoretic concept of simultaneous stabilization. We
construct two games such that any higher-order dynamics that learn the
completely mixed-strategy NE of one of these games can never learn the
completely mixed-strategy NE of the other. Next, motivated by imposing natural
restrictions on allowable learning dynamics, we introduce the Asymptotic Best
Response (ABR) property. Dynamics with the ABR property asymptotically learn a
best response in environments that are asymptotically stationary. We show that
the ABR property relates to an internal stability condition on higher-order
learning dynamics. We provide conditions under which NE are compatible with the
ABR property. Finally, we address learnability of mixed-strategy NE in the
bandit setting using a bandit version of higher-order replicator dynamics.

Motivation: 元宇宙中高分辨率虚拟场景的无线传输面临带宽不足和信道质量差的问题，导致延迟和数据错误，影响用户体验。

Method: 设计了包含VR视频语义传输、视频合成和3D虚拟场景重建三个模块的SC-CEE-Meta架构，通过语义通信减少数据传输量。

Result: 在Meta Quest Pro上验证，SC-CEE-Meta能将无线传输延迟降低96.05%，并在恶劣信道条件下提升图像质量43.99%。

Conclusion: SC-CEE-Meta架构有效解决了元宇宙中的数据传输问题，显著提升了用户体验。

Abstract: With technology advancing and the pursuit of new audiovisual experiences
strengthening, the metaverse has gained surging enthusiasm. However, it faces
practical hurdles as substantial data like high-resolution virtual scenes must
be transmitted between cloud platforms and VR devices. Specifically, the VR
device's wireless transmission hampered by insufficient bandwidth, causes speed
and delay problems. Meanwhile, poor channel quality leads to data errors and
worsens user experience. To solve this, we've proposed the Semantic
Communication-Enabled Cloud-Edge-End Collaborative Immersive Metaverse Service
(SC-CEE-Meta) Architecture, which includes three modules: VR video semantic
transmission, video synthesis, and 3D virtual scene reconstruction. By
deploying semantic modules on VR devices and edge servers and sending key
semantic info instead of focusing on bit-level reconstruction, it can cut
latency, resolve the resource-bandwidth conflict, and better withstand channel
interference. Also, the cloud deploys video synthesis and 3D scene
reconstruction preprocessing, while edge devices host 3D reconstruction
rendering modules, all for immersive services. Verified on Meta Quest Pro, the
SC-CEE-Meta can reduce wireless transmission delay by 96.05\% and boost image
quality by 43.99\% under poor channel condition.

Motivation: 交通场景中的事故预测（TAA）面临数据偏差和因果部分难以识别的问题，需要一种无需额外标注的方法。

Method: 提出AVD模型，通过文本提示生成因果视频帧，并结合EQ-TAA的等变三重损失进行训练。

Result: 实验表明，AVD和EQ-TAA在性能上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AVD和EQ-TAA为交通场景中的事故预测提供了一种高效且无需额外标注的解决方案。

Abstract: Traffic Accident Anticipation (TAA) in traffic scenes is a challenging
problem for achieving zero fatalities in the future. Current approaches
typically treat TAA as a supervised learning task needing the laborious
annotation of accident occurrence duration. However, the inherent long-tailed,
uncertain, and fast-evolving nature of traffic scenes has the problem that real
causal parts of accidents are difficult to identify and are easily dominated by
data bias, resulting in a background confounding issue. Thus, we propose an
Attentive Video Diffusion (AVD) model that synthesizes additional accident
video clips by generating the causal part in dashcam videos, i.e., from normal
clips to accident clips. AVD aims to generate causal video frames based on
accident or accident-free text prompts while preserving the style and content
of frames for TAA after video generation. This approach can be trained using
datasets collected from various driving scenes without any extra annotations.
Additionally, AVD facilitates an Equivariant TAA (EQ-TAA) with an equivariant
triple loss for an anchor accident-free video clip, along with the generated
pair of contrastive pseudo-normal and pseudo-accident clips. Extensive
experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of AVD and EQ-TAA,
and competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods has been
obtained.

Motivation: 现有的3D城市模型缺乏建筑物历史和功能等上下文信息，而多媒体文档（如图片、视频或文本）通常包含此类信息。结合两者可以提升城市分析和理解。

Method: 提出四种方法将多媒体文档整合到3D城市场景中，并设计用户引导模式以辅助媒体消费和场景理解。

Result: 在法国里昂地区的多个项目中验证了这些技术的实用性，例如通过数字导览为标志性建筑提供上下文或展示区域的历史演变。

Conclusion: 整合多媒体文档到3D场景中能有效增强城市理解的上下文信息，并为空间导航的文档搜索提供新途径。

Abstract: Digital 3D representations of urban areas, through their growing
availability, are a helpful tool to better understand a territory. However,
they lack contextual information about, for example, the history or
functionality of buildings. On another side, multimedia documents like images,
videos or texts usually contain such information. Crossing these two types of
data can therefore help in the analysis and understanding of the organization
of our cities. This could also be used to develop document search based on
spatial navigation, instead of the classical textual query. In this paper, we
propose four approaches to integrate multimedia documents in a 3D urban scene,
allowing to contextualize the scene with any type of media. We combine these
integration approaches with user guidance modes that allows to guide the user
through the consumption of these media and support its understanding of the
territory. We demonstrate the usefulness of these techniques in the context of
different projects within the Lyon area (France). The use of multimedia
documents integrated into a digital tour allows, for example, the iconic
buildings to be contextualised or to understand the evolution of a territory
through time.

<details>

Motivation: 现有HER2评估模型通常单独分析H&E或IHC图像，而临床需要两者的协同解释，但双模态获取复杂且成本高。

Method: 1）动态分支选择器；2）双向跨模态GAN；3）混合训练协议。

Result: 单模态H&E预测准确率从71.44%提升至94.25%，双模态准确率达95.09%，IHC单模态可靠性为90.28%。

Conclusion: 该框架在资源有限的环境中具有广泛应用潜力，显著提升了HER2评估的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Current HER2 assessment models for breast cancer predominantly analyze H&E or
IHC images in isolation,despite clinical reliance on their synergistic
interpretation. However, concurrent acquisition of both modalities is often
hindered by workflow complexity and cost constraints. We propose an adaptive
bimodal framework enabling flexible single-/dual-modality HER2 prediction
through three innovations: 1) A dynamic branch selector that activates either
single-modality reconstruction or dual-modality joint inference based on input
completeness; 2) A bidirectional cross-modal GAN performing context-aware
feature-space reconstruction of missing modalities; 3) A hybrid training
protocol integrating adversarial learning and multi-task optimization. This
architecture elevates single-modality H&E prediction accuracy from 71.44% to
94.25% while achieving 95.09% dual-modality accuracy, maintaining 90.28%
reliability with sole IHC inputs. The framework's "dual-preferred,
single-compatible" design delivers near-bimodal performance without requiring
synchronized acquisition, particularly benefiting resource-limited settings
through IHC infrastructure cost reduction. Experimental validation confirms
22.81%/12.90% accuracy improvements over H&E/IHC baselines respectively, with
cross-modal reconstruction enhancing F1-scores to 0.9609 (HE to IHC) and 0.9251
(IHC to HE). By dynamically routing inputs through reconstruction-enhanced or
native fusion pathways, the system mitigates performance degradation from
missing data while preserving computational efficiency (78.55% parameter
reduction in lightweight variant). This elastic architecture demonstrates
significant potential for democratizing precise HER2 assessment across diverse
healthcare settings.

Method: 采用FLAME多模态情感绑定策略和注意力潜扩散模型，结合对比学习和内容感知注意力层。

Result: 在多数指标上优于现有方法，情感相似度提升21.6%，同时保持自然的面部动态。

Conclusion: 该方法通过多模态融合和扩散模型显著提升了3D面部动画的情感表达能力和多样性。

Abstract: Audio-driven emotional 3D facial animation encounters two significant
challenges: (1) reliance on single-modal control signals (videos, text, or
emotion labels) without leveraging their complementary strengths for
comprehensive emotion manipulation, and (2) deterministic regression-based
mapping that constrains the stochastic nature of emotional expressions and
non-verbal behaviors, limiting the expressiveness of synthesized animations. To
address these challenges, we present a diffusion-based framework for
controllable expressive 3D facial animation. Our approach introduces two key
innovations: (1) a FLAME-centered multimodal emotion binding strategy that
aligns diverse modalities (text, audio, and emotion labels) through contrastive
learning, enabling flexible emotion control from multiple signal sources, and
(2) an attention-based latent diffusion model with content-aware attention and
emotion-guided layers, which enriches motion diversity while maintaining
temporal coherence and natural facial dynamics. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches across most
metrics, achieving a 21.6\% improvement in emotion similarity while preserving
physiologically plausible facial dynamics. Project Page:

Conclusion: 该框架为叙事内容分析、交互式故事讲述和多模态推理提供了可扩展的基础。

Abstract: This paper presents a hierarchical knowledge graph framework for the
structured understanding of visual narratives, focusing on multimodal media
such as comics. The proposed method decomposes narrative content into multiple
levels, from macro-level story arcs to fine-grained event segments. It
represents them through integrated knowledge graphs that capture semantic,
spatial, and temporal relationships. At the panel level, we construct
multimodal graphs that link visual elements such as characters, objects, and
actions with corresponding textual components, including dialogue and captions.
These graphs are integrated across narrative levels to support reasoning over
story structure, character continuity, and event progression.
  We apply our approach to a manually annotated subset of the Manga109 dataset
and demonstrate its ability to support symbolic reasoning across diverse
narrative tasks, including action retrieval, dialogue tracing, character
appearance mapping, and panel timeline reconstruction. Evaluation results show
high precision and recall across tasks, validating the coherence and
interpretability of the framework. This work contributes a scalable foundation
for narrative-based content analysis, interactive storytelling, and multimodal
reasoning in visual media.

Method: 使用IEMOCAP语料库中的双人交互数据，结合语音特征（如韵律、MFCCs）和3D面部、手部运动捕捉，量化表达活跃度并预测语音到手势的映射。

Result: 非重叠语音引发更高的表达活跃度，尤其是下半脸和嘴部；悲伤在非重叠时表达更强，愤怒在重叠时抑制手势；韵律和MFCCs在发音区域预测准确性最高。

Conclusion: 多模态情感耦合的动态分析有助于优化情感检测系统，尤其在时间同步和上下文敏感性方面。

Abstract: Human emotional expression emerges through coordinated vocal, facial, and
gestural signals. While speech face alignment is well established, the broader
dynamics linking emotionally expressive speech to regional facial and hand
motion remains critical for gaining a deeper insight into how emotional and
behavior cues are communicated in real interactions. Further modulating the
coordination is the structure of conversational exchange like sequential turn
taking, which creates stable temporal windows for multimodal synchrony, and
simultaneous speech, often indicative of high arousal moments, disrupts this
alignment and impacts emotional clarity. Understanding these dynamics enhances
realtime emotion detection by improving the accuracy of timing and synchrony
across modalities in both human interactions and AI systems. This study
examines multimodal emotion coupling using region specific motion capture from
dyadic interactions in the IEMOCAP corpus. Speech features included low level
prosody, MFCCs, and model derived arousal, valence, and categorical emotions
(Happy, Sad, Angry, Neutral), aligned with 3D facial and hand marker
displacements. Expressive activeness was quantified through framewise
displacement magnitudes, and speech to gesture prediction mapped speech
features to facial and hand movements. Nonoverlapping speech consistently
elicited greater activeness particularly in the lower face and mouth. Sadness
showed increased expressivity during nonoverlap, while anger suppressed
gestures during overlaps. Predictive mapping revealed highest accuracy for
prosody and MFCCs in articulatory regions while arousal and valence had lower
and more context sensitive correlations. Notably, hand speech synchrony was
enhanced under low arousal and overlapping speech, but not for valence.

Abstract: Multimodal intent recognition (MIR) seeks to accurately interpret user
intentions by integrating verbal and non-verbal information across video, audio
and text modalities. While existing approaches prioritize text analysis, they
often overlook the rich semantic content embedded in non-verbal cues. This
paper presents a novel Wavelet-Driven Multimodal Intent Recognition(WDMIR)
framework that enhances intent understanding through frequency-domain analysis
of non-verbal information. To be more specific, we propose: (1) a
wavelet-driven fusion module that performs synchronized decomposition and
integration of video-audio features in the frequency domain, enabling
fine-grained analysis of temporal dynamics; (2) a cross-modal interaction
mechanism that facilitates progressive feature enhancement from bimodal to
trimodal integration, effectively bridging the semantic gap between verbal and
non-verbal information. Extensive experiments on MIntRec demonstrate that our
approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing previous methods by
1.13% on accuracy. Ablation studies further verify that the wavelet-driven
fusion module significantly improves the extraction of semantic information
from non-verbal sources, with a 0.41% increase in recognition accuracy when
analyzing subtle emotional cues.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have rapidly evolved beyond text
generation, now spanning diverse output modalities including images, music,
video, human motion, and 3D objects, by integrating language with other sensory
modalities under unified architectures. This survey categorises six primary
generative modalities and examines how foundational techniques, namely
Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), Mixture of Experts (MoE), Reinforcement
Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting,
enable cross-modal capabilities. We analyze key models, architectural trends,
and emergent cross-modal synergies, while highlighting transferable techniques
and unresolved challenges. Architectural innovations like transformers and
diffusion models underpin this convergence, enabling cross-modal transfer and
modular specialization. We highlight emerging patterns of synergy, and identify
open challenges in evaluation, modularity, and structured reasoning. This
survey offers a unified perspective on MLLM development and identifies critical
paths toward more general-purpose, adaptive, and interpretable multimodal
systems.

### [302] [Can Sound Replace Vision in LLaVA With Token Substitution?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10416)
*Ali Vosoughi,Jing Bi,Pinxin Liu,Yunlong Tang,Chenliang Xu*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: SoundCLIP探索了在多模态大语言模型中直接集成音频和视觉输入的方法，通过替换CLIP的视觉标记为音频表示，并研究了两种配置。实验表明，音频到视频检索性能显著提升，但文本生成质量下降，揭示了跨模态对齐与生成任务之间的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态系统通常依赖文本对齐表示，限制了音频信息的利用。SoundCLIP旨在直接集成音频和视觉输入，以提升音频理解任务的性能。

Method: SoundCLIP通过两种方式集成音频：1) 通过多层感知器将音频特征投影到CLIP的视觉流形；2) 保留原始音频嵌入。实验使用了五种先进的音频编码器。

Result: 音频到视频检索性能显著提升（Top-1准确率提高44个百分点），但文本生成质量下降。语言预训练的编码器（如CLAP、Whisper）在生成任务中表现更好。

Conclusion: 跨模态对齐并非对所有多模态任务都有益，需要在检索准确性和文本生成质量之间找到平衡。WhisperCLIP和AVE-2数据集为未来研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: While multimodal systems have achieved impressive advances, they typically
rely on text-aligned representations rather than directly integrating audio and
visual inputs. This reliance can limit the use of acoustic information in tasks
requiring nuanced audio understanding. In response, SoundCLIP explores direct
audio-visual integration within multimodal large language models (MLLMs) by
substituting CLIP's visual tokens with audio representations and selecting
sound-relevant patch tokens in models such as LLaVA. We investigate two
configurations: (1) projecting audio features into CLIP's visual manifold via a
multilayer perceptron trained with InfoNCE on paired audio-video segments, and
(2) preserving raw audio embeddings with minimal dimensional adjustments.
Experiments with five state-of-the-art audio encoders reveal a fundamental
trade-off. While audio-to-video retrieval performance increases dramatically
(up to 44 percentage points in Top-1 accuracy) when audio is projected into
CLIP's space, text generation quality declines. Encoders pre-trained with text
supervision (CLAP, Whisper, ImageBind) maintain stronger generative
capabilities than those focused primarily on audiovisual alignment (Wav2CLIP,
AudioCLIP), highlighting the value of language exposure for generation tasks.
We introduce WhisperCLIP, an architecture that fuses intermediate
representations from Whisper, as well as AudioVisual Event Evaluation (AVE-2),
a dataset of 580,147 three-second audiovisual clips with fine-grained alignment
annotations. Our findings challenge the assumption that stronger cross-modal
alignment necessarily benefits all multimodal tasks; instead, a Pareto frontier
emerges wherein optimal performance depends on balancing retrieval accuracy
with text generation quality. Codes and datasets:

Abstract: Robotics and artificial intelligence hold significant potential for advancing
precision agriculture. While robotic systems have been successfully deployed

challenging, particularly because end users often lack technical expertise. In
this paper, we present an end-to-end system that leverages large language
models (LLMs), specifically ChatGPT, to enable users to assign complex data
collection tasks to autonomous robots using natural language instructions. To
enhance reusability, mission plans are encoded using an existing IEEE task
specification standard, and are executed on robots via ROS2 nodes that bridge
high-level mission descriptions with existing ROS libraries. Through extensive
experiments, we highlight the strengths and limitations of LLMs in this
context, particularly regarding spatial reasoning and solving complex routing
challenges, and show how our proposed implementation overcomes them.

Motivation: 自动驾驶系统的安全验证需要了解场景参数的联合概率分布，而现有方法（高斯混合模型和高斯Copula模型）在建模多模态数据和依赖关系时存在局限性。

Method: 提出高斯混合Copula模型，分别建模边缘分布和依赖关系，并与高斯混合模型和高斯Copula模型进行对比。

Result: 在1800万个场景实例的评估中，高斯混合Copula模型在似然和Sinkhorn距离上表现更优。

Conclusion: 高斯混合Copula模型为未来基于场景的验证框架提供了更可靠的基础。

Abstract: This paper presents the first application of Gaussian Mixture Copula Models
to the statistical modeling of driving scenarios for the safety validation of
automated driving systems. Knowledge of the joint probability distribution of
scenario parameters is essential for scenario-based safety assessment, where
risk quantification depends on the likelihood of concrete parameter
combinations. Gaussian Mixture Copula Models bring together the multimodal
expressivity of Gaussian Mixture Models and the flexibility of copulas,
enabling separate modeling of marginal distributions and dependencies. We
benchmark Gaussian Mixture Copula Models against previously proposed approaches
- Gaussian Mixture Models and Gaussian Copula Models - using real-world driving
data drawn from scenarios defined in United Nations Regulation No. 157. Our
evaluation across 18 million scenario instances demonstrates that Gaussian
Mixture Copula Models provide a better fit to the data in terms of both
likelihood and Sinkhorn distance. These results suggest that Gaussian Mixture
Copula Models are a compelling foundation for future scenario-based validation
frameworks.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is transforming precision agriculture, offering
farmers new tools to streamline their daily operations. While these
technological advances promise increased efficiency, they often introduce
additional complexity and steep learning curves that are particularly
challenging for non-technical users who must balance tech adoption with
existing workloads. In this paper, we present a natural language (NL) robotic
mission planner that enables non-specialists to control heterogeneous robots
through a common interface. By leveraging large language models (LLMs) and
predefined primitives, our architecture seamlessly translates human language
into intermediate descriptions that can be executed by different robotic
platforms. With this system, users can formulate complex agricultural missions
without writing any code. In the work presented in this paper, we extend our
previous system tailored for wheeled robot mission planning through a new class
of experiments involving robotic manipulation and computer vision tasks. Our
results demonstrate that the architecture is both general enough to support a
diverse set of robots and powerful enough to execute complex mission requests.
This work represents a significant step toward making robotic automation in
precision agriculture more accessible to non-technical users.

Conclusion: 模块化框架为可扩展和高效的导航系统奠定了基础，未来可通过增强环境先验和扩展多模态输入进一步改进。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) presents a complex challenge in embodied
AI, requiring agents to interpret natural language instructions and navigate
through visually rich, unfamiliar environments. Recent advances in large
vision-language models (LVLMs), such as CLIP and Flamingo, have significantly
improved multimodal understanding but introduced new challenges related to
computational cost and real-time deployment. In this project, we propose a
modular, plug-and-play navigation framework that decouples vision-language
understanding from action planning. By integrating a frozen vision-language
model, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, with lightweight planning logic, we aim to
achieve flexible, fast, and adaptable navigation without extensive model
fine-tuning. Our framework leverages prompt engineering, structured history
management, and a two-frame visual input strategy to enhance decision-making
continuity across navigation steps. We evaluate our system on the Room-to-Room
benchmark within the VLN-CE setting using the Matterport3D dataset and
Habitat-Lab simulation environment. Although our initial results reveal
challenges in generalizing to unseen environments under strict evaluation
settings, our modular approach lays a foundation for scalable and efficient
navigation systems, highlighting promising directions for future improvement
through enhanced environmental priors and expanded multimodal input
integration.

Result: 在不同机器人上验证了多操作模式的可行性和编程便捷性。

Conclusion: 该框架通过灵活的模式切换和优化设计，显著提升了任务效率和操作精度。

Abstract: Probabilistic Virtual Fixtures (VFs) enable the adaptive selection of the
most suitable haptic feedback for each phase of a task, based on learned or
perceived uncertainty. While keeping the human in the loop remains essential,
for instance, to ensure high precision, partial automation of certain task
phases is critical for productivity. We present a unified framework for
probabilistic VFs that seamlessly switches between manual fixtures,
semi-automated fixtures (with the human handling precise tasks), and full
autonomy. We introduce a novel probabilistic Dynamical System-based VF for
coarse guidance, enabling the robot to autonomously complete certain task
phases while keeping the human operator in the loop. For tasks requiring
precise guidance, we extend probabilistic position-based trajectory fixtures
with automation allowing for seamless human interaction as well as
geometry-awareness and optimal impedance gains. For manual tasks requiring very
precise guidance, we also extend visual servoing fixtures with the same
geometry-awareness and impedance behaviour. We validate our approach
experimentally on different robots, showcasing multiple operation modes and the
ease of programming fixtures.

Result: 仿真验证了所提控制器在不同场景下的有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方案鲁棒性强，易于在不同工业机器人系统中实现。

Abstract: Image-based visual servoing (IBVS) methods have been well developed and used
in many applications, especially in pose (position and orientation) alignment.
However, most research papers focused on developing control solutions when 3D
point features can be detected inside the field of view. This work proposes an
innovative feedforward-feedback adaptive control algorithm structure with the
Youla Parameterization method. A designed feature estimation loop ensures
stable and fast motion control when point features are outside the field of
view. As 3D point features move inside the field of view, the IBVS feedback
loop preserves the precision of the pose at the end of the control period.
Also, an adaptive controller is developed in the feedback loop to stabilize the
system in the entire range of operations. The nonlinear camera and robot
manipulator model is linearized and decoupled online by an adaptive algorithm.
The adaptive controller is then computed based on the linearized model
evaluated at current linearized point. The proposed solution is robust and easy
to implement in different industrial robotic systems. Various scenarios are
used in simulations to validate the effectiveness and robust performance of the
proposed controller.

Motivation: 在机器人导航和操作中，准确确定相机相对于环境的位姿是关键。然而，在基于图像的视觉伺服控制中，过约束问题可能导致相机陷入局部最小值，影响稳定性。

Result: 仿真结果表明，该方法有效避免了局部最小值，使相机能够准确高效地达到目标位姿。

Conclusion: 该控制策略为立体相机在视觉伺服控制中的位姿估计提供了稳定且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: In robot navigation and manipulation, accurately determining the camera's
pose relative to the environment is crucial for effective task execution. In
this paper, we systematically prove that this problem corresponds to the
Perspective-3-Point (P3P) formulation, where exactly three known 3D points and
their corresponding 2D image projections are used to estimate the pose of a
stereo camera. In image-based visual servoing (IBVS) control, the system
becomes overdetermined, as the 6 degrees of freedom (DoF) of the stereo camera
must align with 9 observed 2D features in the scene. When more constraints are
imposed than available DoFs, global stability cannot be guaranteed, as the
camera may become trapped in a local minimum far from the desired configuration
during servoing. To address this issue, we propose a novel control strategy for
accurately positioning a calibrated stereo camera. Our approach integrates a
feedforward controller with a Youla parameterization-based feedback controller,
ensuring robust servoing performance. Through simulations, we demonstrate that
our method effectively avoids local minima and enables the camera to reach the
desired pose accurately and efficiently.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决模型不确定性高时安全控制任务中安全过滤器可能失效的问题。

Method: 结合控制屏障函数和高斯过程，动态收集数据以确保安全。

Result: 方法在零均值先验动力学模型下可证明安全，无需备用控制器。

Conclusion: 首次实现无需备用控制器的安全学习控制方法。

Abstract: Control tasks with safety requirements under high levels of model uncertainty
are increasingly common. Machine learning techniques are frequently used to
address such tasks, typically by leveraging model error bounds to specify
robust constraint-based safety filters. However, if the learned model
uncertainty is very high, the corresponding filters are potentially invalid,
meaning no control input satisfies the constraints imposed by the safety
filter. While most works address this issue by assuming some form of safe
backup controller, ours tackles it by collecting additional data on the fly
using a Gaussian process bandit-type algorithm. We combine a control barrier
function with a learned model to specify a robust certificate that ensures
safety if feasible. Whenever infeasibility occurs, we leverage the control
barrier function to guide exploration, ensuring the collected data contributes
toward the closed-loop system safety. By combining a safety filter with
exploration in this manner, our method provably achieves safety in a setting
that allows for a zero-mean prior dynamics model, without requiring a backup
controller. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first safe learning-based
control method that achieves this.

Conclusion: 多尺度贝叶斯优化方法在复杂动态系统中表现优异，为核聚变控制提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Machine learning algorithms often struggle to control complex real-world
systems. In the case of nuclear fusion, these challenges are exacerbated, as
the dynamics are notoriously complex, data is poor, hardware is subject to
failures, and experiments often affect dynamics beyond the experiment's
duration. Existing tools like reinforcement learning, supervised learning, and
Bayesian optimization address some of these challenges but fail to provide a
comprehensive solution. To overcome these limitations, we present a multi-scale
Bayesian optimization approach that integrates a high-frequency data-driven
dynamics model with a low-frequency Gaussian process. By updating the Gaussian
process between experiments, the method rapidly adapts to new data, refining
the predictions of the less reliable dynamical model. We validate our approach
by controlling tearing instabilities in the DIII-D nuclear fusion plant.
Offline testing on historical data shows that our method significantly
outperforms several baselines. Results on live experiments on the DIII-D
tokamak, conducted under high-performance plasma scenarios prone to
instabilities, shows a 50% success rate, marking a 117% improvement over
historical outcomes.

Conclusion: 该方法能够泛化并适应多样化的拓扑结构和条件，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Lane-topology prediction is a critical component of safe and reliable
autonomous navigation. An accurate understanding of the road environment aids
this task. We observe that this information often follows conventions encoded
in natural language, through design codes that reflect the road structure and
road names that capture the road functionality. We augment this information in
a lightweight manner to SMERF, a map-prior-based online lane-topology
prediction model, by combining structured road metadata from OSM maps and
lane-width priors from Road design manuals with the road centerline encodings.
We evaluate our method on two geo-diverse complex intersection scenarios. Our
method shows improvement in both lane and traffic element detection and their
association. We report results using four topology-aware metrics to
comprehensively assess the model performance. These results demonstrate the
ability of our approach to generalize and scale to diverse topologies and
conditions.

Abstract: This work demonstrates how autonomously learning aspects of robotic operation
from sparsely-labeled, real-world data of deployed, engineered solutions at
industrial scale can provide with solutions that achieve improved performance.
Specifically, it focuses on multi-suction robot picking and performs a
comprehensive study on the application of multi-modal visual encoders for
predicting the success of candidate robotic picks. Picking diverse items from
unstructured piles is an important and challenging task for robot manipulation
in real-world settings, such as warehouses. Methods for picking from clutter
must work for an open set of items while simultaneously meeting latency
constraints to achieve high throughput. The demonstrated approach utilizes
multiple input modalities, such as RGB, depth and semantic segmentation, to
estimate the quality of candidate multi-suction picks. The strategy is trained
from real-world item picking data, with a combination of multimodal pretrain
and finetune. The manuscript provides comprehensive experimental evaluation
performed over a large item-picking dataset, an item-picking dataset targeted
to include partial occlusions, and a package-picking dataset, which focuses on
containers, such as boxes and envelopes, instead of unpackaged items. The
evaluation measures performance for different item configurations, pick scenes,
and object types. Ablations help to understand the effects of in-domain
pretraining, the impact of different modalities and the importance of
finetuning. These ablations reveal both the importance of training over
multiple modalities but also the ability of models to learn during pretraining
the relationship between modalities so that during finetuning and inference,
only a subset of them can be used as input.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统FOT方法在高自动化级别下测试效率低下且成本高昂，亟需改进方法以提升验证效率。

Method: 系统识别并评估了FOT的减少方法（RAs），基于ISO 21448提出了通用模型和基础模型，并应用四种标准评估RAs。

Result: 研究发现现有方法虽有潜力，但均存在不足，且无法完全替代FOT。

Conclusion: FOT在ADAS和ADS安全验证中仍不可或缺，未来需进一步研究改进方法。

Abstract: The safety validation of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and
Automated Driving Systems (ADS) increasingly demands efficient and reliable
methods to quantify residual risk while adhering to international standards
such as ISO 21448. Traditionally, Field Operational Testing (FOT) has been
pivotal for macroscopic safety validation of automotive driving functions up to
SAE automation level 2. However, state-of-the-art derivations for empirical
safety demonstrations using FOT often result in impractical testing efforts,
particularly at higher automation levels. Even at lower automation levels, this
limitation - coupled with the substantial costs associated with FOT - motivates
the exploration of approaches to enhance the efficiency of FOT-based
macroscopic safety validation. Therefore, this publication systematically
identifies and evaluates state-of-the-art Reduction Approaches (RAs) for FOT,
including novel methods reported in the literature. Based on an analysis of ISO
21448, two models are derived: a generic model capturing the argumentation
components of the standard, and a base model, exemplarily applied to Automatic
Emergency Braking (AEB) systems, establishing a baseline for the real-world
driving requirement for a Quantitative Safety Validation of Residual Risk
(QSVRR). Subsequently, the RAs are assessed using four criteria:
quantifiability, threats to validity, missing links, and black box
compatibility, highlighting potential benefits, inherent limitations, and
identifying key areas for further research. Our evaluation reveals that, while
several approaches offer potential, none are free from missing links or other
substantial shortcomings. Moreover, no identified alternative can fully replace
FOT, reflecting its crucial role in the safety validation of ADAS and ADS.

Abstract: Robotic navigation in dense, cluttered environments such as agricultural
canopies presents significant challenges due to physical and visual occlusion
caused by leaves and branches. Traditional vision-based or model-dependent
approaches often fail in these settings, where physical interaction without
damaging foliage and branches is necessary to reach a target. We present a
novel reactive controller that enables safe navigation for a robotic arm in a
contact-rich, cluttered, deformable environment using end-effector position and
real-time tactile feedback. Our proposed framework's interaction strategy is
based on a trade-off between minimizing disturbance by maneuvering around
obstacles and pushing through them to move towards the target. We show that
over 35 trials in 3 experimental plant setups with an occluded target, the
proposed controller successfully reached the target in all trials without
breaking any branch and outperformed the state-of-the-art model-free controller
in robustness and adaptability. This work lays the foundation for safe,
adaptive interaction in cluttered, contact-rich deformable environments,
enabling future agricultural tasks such as pruning and harvesting in plant
canopies.

Method: 通过两项真实世界研究，使用混合检索和生成模型的对话AI后端，在博物馆环境中与188名参与者互动。

Result: 群体敏感对话设计未显著影响满意度，但揭示了多模态策略的需求。

Conclusion: 研究为群体对话适应提供了新见解，对HAI、HRI和HMI领域有贡献。

Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of a group-adaptive conversation design in
two socially interactive agents (SIAs) through two real-world studies. Both
SIAs - Furhat, a social robot, and MetaHuman, a virtual agent - were equipped
with a conversational artificial intelligence (CAI) backend combining hybrid
retrieval and generative models. The studies were carried out in an in-the-wild
setting with a total of $N = 188$ participants who interacted with the SIAs -
in dyads, triads or larger groups - at a German museum. Although the results
did not reveal a significant effect of the group-sensitive conversation design
on perceived satisfaction, the findings provide valuable insights into the
challenges of adapting CAI for multi-party interactions and across different
embodiments (robot vs.\ virtual agent), highlighting the need for multimodal
strategies beyond linguistic pluralization. These insights contribute to the
fields of Human-Agent Interaction (HAI), Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), and
broader Human-Machine Interaction (HMI), providing insights for future research
on effective dialogue adaptation in group settings.

Abstract: Constructing a physically realistic and accurately scaled simulated 3D world
is crucial for the training and evaluation of embodied intelligence tasks. The
diversity, realism, low cost accessibility and affordability of 3D data assets
are critical for achieving generalization and scalability in embodied AI.
However, most current embodied intelligence tasks still rely heavily on
traditional 3D computer graphics assets manually created and annotated, which
suffer from high production costs and limited realism. These limitations
significantly hinder the scalability of data driven approaches. We present
EmbodiedGen, a foundational platform for interactive 3D world generation. It
enables the scalable generation of high-quality, controllable and
photorealistic 3D assets with accurate physical properties and real-world scale
in the Unified Robotics Description Format (URDF) at low cost. These assets can
be directly imported into various physics simulation engines for fine-grained
physical control, supporting downstream tasks in training and evaluation.
EmbodiedGen is an easy-to-use, full-featured toolkit composed of six key
modules: Image-to-3D, Text-to-3D, Texture Generation, Articulated Object
Generation, Scene Generation and Layout Generation. EmbodiedGen generates
diverse and interactive 3D worlds composed of generative 3D assets, leveraging
generative AI to address the challenges of generalization and evaluation to the
needs of embodied intelligence related research. Code is available at

Conclusion: Lie群表述的空间表示法为机器人控制提供了紧凑且高效的计算方案。

Abstract: Optimal control in general, and flatness-based control in particular, of
robotic arms necessitate to compute the first and second time derivatives of
the joint torques/forces required to achieve a desired motion. In view of the
required computational efficiency, recursive $O(n)$-algorithms were proposed to
this end. Aiming at compact yet efficient formulations, a Lie group formulation
was recently proposed, making use of body-fixed and hybrid representation of
twists and wrenches. In this paper a formulation is introduced using the
spatial representation. The second-order inverse dynamics algorithm is
accompanied by a fourth-order forward and inverse kinematics algorithm. An
advantage of all Lie group formulations is that they can be parameterized in
terms of vectorial quantities that are readily available. The method is
demonstrated for the 7 DOF Franka Emika Panda robot.

Result: 在模拟和真实环境中均表现优异，支持开放词汇目标理解和泛化导航。

Conclusion: VLFly展示了在复杂环境中实现语言引导导航的潜力。

Abstract: Vision-and-language navigation (VLN) is a long-standing challenge in
autonomous robotics, aiming to empower agents with the ability to follow human
instructions while navigating complex environments. Two key bottlenecks remain
in this field: generalization to out-of-distribution environments and reliance
on fixed discrete action spaces. To address these challenges, we propose
Vision-Language Fly (VLFly), a framework tailored for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
(UAVs) to execute language-guided flight. Without the requirement for
localization or active ranging sensors, VLFly outputs continuous velocity
commands purely from egocentric observations captured by an onboard monocular
camera. The VLFly integrates three modules: an instruction encoder based on a
large language model (LLM) that reformulates high-level language into
structured prompts, a goal retriever powered by a vision-language model (VLM)
that matches these prompts to goal images via vision-language similarity, and a
waypoint planner that generates executable trajectories for real-time UAV
control. VLFly is evaluated across diverse simulation environments without
additional fine-tuning and consistently outperforms all baselines. Moreover,
real-world VLN tasks in indoor and outdoor environments under direct and
indirect instructions demonstrate that VLFly achieves robust open-vocabulary
goal understanding and generalized navigation capabilities, even in the
presence of abstract language input.

Abstract: Accurate in-hand pose estimation is crucial for robotic object manipulation,
but visual occlusion remains a major challenge for vision-based approaches.
This paper presents an approach to robotic in-hand object pose estimation,
combining visual and tactile information to accurately determine the position
and orientation of objects grasped by a robotic hand. We address the challenge
of visual occlusion by fusing visual information from a wrist-mounted RGB-D
camera with tactile information from vision-based tactile sensors mounted on
the fingertips of a robotic gripper. Our approach employs a weighting and
sensor fusion module to combine point clouds from heterogeneous sensor types
and control each modality's contribution to the pose estimation process. We use
an augmented Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm adapted for weighted point
clouds to estimate the 6D object pose. Our experiments show that incorporating
tactile information significantly improves pose estimation accuracy,
particularly when occlusion is high. Our method achieves an average pose
estimation error of 7.5 mm and 16.7 degrees, outperforming vision-only
baselines by up to 20%. We also demonstrate the ability of our method to
perform precise object manipulation in a real-world insertion task.

Motivation: 现有语言条件操作任务假设指令与环境完美对齐，限制了在现实场景中的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Method: 构建包含14,000多样本的数据集，提出RationalVLA模型，结合视觉语言模型和操作策略。

Result: RationalVLA在RAMA上成功率高14.5%，任务长度短0.94，且在真实应用中验证了有效性。

Conclusion: RAMA和RationalVLA为处理现实世界中复杂指令提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: A fundamental requirement for real-world robotic deployment is the ability to
understand and respond to natural language instructions. Existing
language-conditioned manipulation tasks typically assume that instructions are
perfectly aligned with the environment. This assumption limits robustness and
generalization in realistic scenarios where instructions may be ambiguous,
irrelevant, or infeasible. To address this problem, we introduce RAtional
MAnipulation (RAMA), a new benchmark that challenges models with both unseen
executable instructions and defective ones that should be rejected. In RAMA, we
construct a dataset with over 14,000 samples, including diverse defective
instructions spanning six dimensions: visual, physical, semantic, motion,
safety, and out-of-context. We further propose the Rational
Vision-Language-Action model (RationalVLA). It is a dual system for robotic
arms that integrates the high-level vision-language model with the low-level
manipulation policy by introducing learnable latent space embeddings. This
design enables RationalVLA to reason over instructions, reject infeasible
commands, and execute manipulation effectively. Experiments demonstrate that
RationalVLA outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on RAMA by a 14.5% higher
success rate and 0.94 average task length, while maintaining competitive
performance on standard manipulation tasks. Real-world trials further validate
its effectiveness and robustness in practical applications. Our project page is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自主水面船在海洋科学中日益重要，但精确的状态估计（尤其是姿态）对海底测绘至关重要。传统方法依赖固定地标的相对位置测量，而开放海洋中的ASV主要观测的是后退的地平线。

Method: 利用前向单目相机估计地平线相关的横滚和俯仰角，结合双天线GPS航向测量，提出了一种新的InEKF框架，用于整合部分方向数据。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在开放海洋环境中对ASV状态估计具有高效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的部分方向测量方法为ASV状态估计提供了一种有效的解决方案，尤其在开放海洋环境中表现优异。

Abstract: Autonomous surface vessels (ASVs) are increasingly vital for marine science,
offering robust platforms for underwater mapping and inspection. Accurate state
estimation, particularly of vehicle pose, is paramount for precise seafloor
mapping, as even small surface deviations can have significant consequences
when sensing the seafloor below. To address this challenge, we propose an
Invariant Extended Kalman Filter (InEKF) framework designed to integrate
partial orientation measurements. While conventional estimation often relies on
relative position measurements to fixed landmarks, open ocean ASVs primarily
observe a receding horizon. We leverage forward-facing monocular cameras to
estimate roll and pitch with respect to this horizon, which provides
yaw-ambiguous partial orientation information. To effectively utilize these
measurements within the InEKF, we introduce a novel framework for incorporating
such partial orientation data. This approach contrasts with traditional InEKF
implementations that assume full orientation measurements and is particularly
relevant for planar vehicle motion constrained to a "seafaring plane." This
paper details the developed InEKF framework; its integration with horizon-based
roll/pitch observations and dual-antenna GPS heading measurements for ASV state
estimation; and provides a comparative analysis against the InEKF using full
orientation and a Multiplicative EKF (MEKF). Our results demonstrate the
efficacy and robustness of the proposed partial orientation measurements for
accurate ASV state estimation in open ocean environments.

Conclusion: 该方法为机器人在未知复杂地形中的导航和探索提供了高效工具，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: An alternative data-driven modeling approach has been proposed and employed
to gain fundamental insights into robot motion interaction with granular
terrain at certain length scales. The approach is based on an integration of
dimension reduction (Sequentially Truncated Higher-Order Singular Value
Decomposition), surrogate modeling (Gaussian Process), and data assimilation
techniques (Reduced Order Particle Filter). This approach can be used online
and is based on offline data, obtained from the offline collection of
high-fidelity simulation data and a set of sparse experimental data. The
results have shown that orders of magnitude reduction in computational time can
be obtained from the proposed data-driven modeling approach compared with
physics-based high-fidelity simulations. With only simulation data as input,
the data-driven prediction technique can generate predictions that have
comparable accuracy as simulations. With both simulation data and sparse
physical experimental measurement as input, the data-driven approach with its
embedded data assimilation techniques has the potential in outperforming only
high-fidelity simulations for the long-horizon predictions. In addition, it is
demonstrated that the data-driven modeling approach can also reproduce the
scaling relationship recovered by physics-based simulations for maximum
resistive forces, which may indicate its general predictability beyond a
case-by-case basis. The results are expected to help robot navigation and
exploration in unknown and complex terrains during both online and offline
phases.

Result: 高信任时人类更倾向自主部署机器人；长解释修复信任最佳，否认防止信任流失最有效。

Conclusion: 模型为实时调整人类对自主系统信任提供了基础，信任估计与自报告值一致，具有可解释性。

Abstract: With increasing efficiency and reliability, autonomous systems are becoming
valuable assistants to humans in various tasks. In the context of
robot-assisted delivery, we investigate how robot performance and trust repair
strategies impact human trust. In this task, while handling a secondary task,
humans can choose to either send the robot to deliver autonomously or manually
control it. The trust repair strategies examined include short and long
explanations, apology and promise, and denial.
  Using data from human participants, we model human behavior using an
Input-Output Hidden Markov Model (IOHMM) to capture the dynamics of trust and
human action probabilities. Our findings indicate that humans are more likely
to deploy the robot autonomously when their trust is high. Furthermore, state
transition estimates show that long explanations are the most effective at
repairing trust following a failure, while denial is most effective at
preventing trust loss.
  We also demonstrate that the trust estimates generated by our model are
isomorphic to self-reported trust values, making them interpretable. This model
lays the groundwork for developing optimal policies that facilitate real-time
adjustment of human trust in autonomous systems.

friction coefficient, effectively emulating changes in gripping force. Second,
we derive a sliding motion model for objects clamped in a parallel gripper with
two symmetric, variable-friction contact patches. Third, we propose a motion
planner that coordinates end-effector finger trajectories and fingertip
vibrations to achieve the desired object pose. In real-world trials, Vib2Move
consistently yields final positioning errors below 6 mm, demonstrating
reliable, high-precision manipulation across a variety of planar objects. For

Method: 提出GenManip平台，利用LLM驱动的任务场景图自动生成多样化任务，并开发GenManip-Bench基准评估策略泛化能力。

Result: 实验表明，基于基础模型的模块化系统在多样化场景中泛化能力更强，而端到端策略通过数据扩展也能获益。

Abstract: Robotic manipulation in real-world settings remains challenging, especially
regarding robust generalization. Existing simulation platforms lack sufficient
support for exploring how policies adapt to varied instructions and scenarios.
Thus, they lag behind the growing interest in instruction-following foundation
models like LLMs, whose adaptability is crucial yet remains underexplored in
fair comparisons. To bridge this gap, we introduce GenManip, a realistic
tabletop simulation platform tailored for policy generalization studies. It
features an automatic pipeline via LLM-driven task-oriented scene graph to
synthesize large-scale, diverse tasks using 10K annotated 3D object assets. To
systematically assess generalization, we present GenManip-Bench, a benchmark of
200 scenarios refined via human-in-the-loop corrections. We evaluate two policy
types: (1) modular manipulation systems integrating foundation models for
perception, reasoning, and planning, and (2) end-to-end policies trained
through scalable data collection. Results show that while data scaling benefits
end-to-end methods, modular systems enhanced with foundation models generalize
more effectively across diverse scenarios. We anticipate this platform to
facilitate critical insights for advancing policy generalization in realistic
conditions. Project Page: https://genmanip.axi404.top/.

Conclusion: EyeRobot展示了手眼协调行为的有效性，为单摄像头下的大范围操作提供了解决方案。

Abstract: Humans do not passively observe the visual world -- we actively look in order
to act. Motivated by this principle, we introduce EyeRobot, a robotic system
with gaze behavior that emerges from the need to complete real-world tasks. We
develop a mechanical eyeball that can freely rotate to observe its surroundings
and train a gaze policy to control it using reinforcement learning. We
accomplish this by first collecting teleoperated demonstrations paired with a
360 camera. This data is imported into a simulation environment that supports
rendering arbitrary eyeball viewpoints, allowing episode rollouts of eye gaze
on top of robot demonstrations. We then introduce a BC-RL loop to train the
hand and eye jointly: the hand (BC) agent is trained from rendered eye
observations, and the eye (RL) agent is rewarded when the hand produces correct
action predictions. In this way, hand-eye coordination emerges as the eye looks
towards regions which allow the hand to complete the task. EyeRobot implements
a foveal-inspired policy architecture allowing high resolution with a small
compute budget, which we find also leads to the emergence of more stable
fixation as well as improved ability to track objects and ignore distractors.
We evaluate EyeRobot on five panoramic workspace manipulation tasks requiring
manipulation in an arc surrounding the robot arm. Our experiments suggest
EyeRobot exhibits hand-eye coordination behaviors which effectively facilitate
manipulation over large workspaces with a single camera. See project site for

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦音频分类面临数据异构性、模型异构性和数据中毒三大挑战，现有方法缺乏统一解决方案。

Method: FedMLAC采用双模型架构（个性化本地模型和轻量级全局插件模型），结合双向知识蒸馏和层剪枝聚合策略。

Result: 在多个音频分类基准测试中，FedMLAC在分类准确性和抗噪性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FedMLAC为联邦音频分类提供了一种高效、鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) provides a privacy-preserving paradigm for training
audio classification (AC) models across distributed clients without sharing raw
data. However, Federated Audio Classification (FedAC) faces three critical
challenges that substantially hinder performance: data heterogeneity, model
heterogeneity, and data poisoning. While prior works have attempted to address
these issues, they are typically treated independently, lacking a unified and
robust solution suited to real-world federated audio scenarios. To bridge this
gap, we propose FedMLAC, a unified mutual learning framework designed to
simultaneously tackle these challenges in FedAC. Specifically, FedMLAC
introduces a dual-model architecture on each client, comprising a personalized
local AC model and a lightweight, globally shared Plug-in model. Through
bidirectional knowledge distillation, the Plug-in model enables global
knowledge transfer while adapting to client-specific data distributions, thus
supporting both generalization and personalization. To further enhance
robustness against corrupted audio data, we develop a Layer-wise Pruning
Aggregation (LPA) strategy that filters unreliable Plug-in model updates based
on parameter deviations during server-side aggregation. Extensive experiments
on four diverse audio classification benchmarks, spanning both speech and
non-speech tasks, demonstrate that FedMLAC consistently outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods in terms of classification accuracy and robustness to
noisy data.

Abstract: We present a method for fine-grained control over music generation through
inference-time interventions on an autoregressive generative music transformer
called MusicGen. Our approach enables timbre transfer, style transfer, and
genre fusion by steering the residual stream using weights of linear probes
trained on it, or by steering the attention layer activations in a similar
manner. We observe that modelling this as a regression task provides improved
performance, hypothesizing that the mean-squared-error better preserve
meaningful directional information in the activation space. Combined with the
global conditioning offered by text prompts in MusicGen, our method provides
both global and local control over music generation. Audio samples illustrating
our method are available at our demo page.

Abstract: Discrete audio tokens are compact representations that aim to preserve
perceptual quality, phonetic content, and speaker characteristics while
enabling efficient storage and inference, as well as competitive performance
across diverse downstream tasks.They provide a practical alternative to
continuous features, enabling the integration of speech and audio into modern
large language models (LLMs). As interest in token-based audio processing
grows, various tokenization methods have emerged, and several surveys have
reviewed the latest progress in the field. However, existing studies often
focus on specific domains or tasks and lack a unified comparison across various
benchmarks. This paper presents a systematic review and benchmark of discrete
audio tokenizers, covering three domains: speech, music, and general audio. We
propose a taxonomy of tokenization approaches based on encoder-decoder,
quantization techniques, training paradigm, streamability, and application
domains. We evaluate tokenizers on multiple benchmarks for reconstruction,
downstream performance, and acoustic language modeling, and analyze trade-offs
through controlled ablation studies. Our findings highlight key limitations,
practical considerations, and open challenges, providing insight and guidance
for future research in this rapidly evolving area. For more information,

Conclusion: 优化架构设计可有效增强音频-LLM的跨模态信息传递能力。

Abstract: The integration of audio perception capabilities into Large Language Models
(LLMs) has enabled significant advances in Audio-LLMs. Although
application-focused developments, particularly in curating training data for
specific capabilities e.g., audio reasoning, have progressed rapidly, the
underlying mechanisms that govern efficient transfer of rich semantic
representations from audio encoders to LLMs remain under-explored. We
conceptualize effective audio-LLM interaction as the LLM's ability to
proficiently probe the audio encoder representations to satisfy textual
queries. This paper presents a systematic investigation on how architectural
design choices can affect that. Beginning with a standard Pengi/LLaVA-style
audio-LLM architecture, we propose and evaluate several modifications guided by
hypotheses derived from mechanistic interpretability studies and LLM
operational principles. Our experiments demonstrate that: (1) delaying audio
integration until the LLM's initial layers establish textual context that
enhances its ability to probe the audio representations for relevant
information; (2) the LLM can proficiently probe audio representations
exclusively through LLM layer's attention submodule, without requiring
propagation to its Feed-Forward Network (FFN) submodule; (3) an efficiently
integrated ensemble of diverse audio encoders provides richer, complementary
representations, thereby broadening the LLM's capacity to probe a wider
spectrum of audio information. All hypotheses are evaluated using an identical
three-stage training curriculum on a dataset of 5.6 million audio-text pairs,
ensuring controlled comparisons. Our final architecture, which incorporates all
proposed modifications, achieves relative improvements from 10\% to 60\% over
the baseline, validating our approach to optimizing cross-modal information
transfer in audio-LLMs. Project page: https://ta012.github.io/PAL/

Abstract: Spatial Semantic Segmentation of Sound Scenes (S5) aims to enhance
technologies for sound event detection and separation from multi-channel input
signals that mix multiple sound events with spatial information. This is a
fundamental basis of immersive communication. The ultimate goal is to separate
sound event signals with 6 Degrees of Freedom (6DoF) information into dry sound
object signals and metadata about the object type (sound event class) and
representing spatial information, including direction. However, because several
existing challenge tasks already provide some of the subset functions, this
task for this year focuses on detecting and separating sound events from
multi-channel spatial input signals. This paper outlines the S5 task setting of
the Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE) 2025
Challenge Task 4 and the DCASE2025 Task 4 Dataset, newly recorded and curated
for this task. We also report experimental results for an S5 system trained and
evaluated on this dataset. The full version of this paper will be published
after the challenge results are made public.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的声学掩蔽方法BNMusic，通过生成个性化音乐来减少环境噪音的感知，替代传统的音量增加方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统声学掩蔽技术因主导声音与噪音不匹配（如节拍错位）需过度增加音量，效果有限。受跨模态生成技术启发，研究提出新方法。

Method: BNMusic框架分两阶段：1）基于用户文本提示生成音乐；2）自适应放大音乐片段以增强掩蔽效果并保持音质。

Result: 在MusicBench、EPIC-SOUNDS和ESC-50数据集上的实验表明，该方法能有效将噪音与节奏对齐的音乐融合，减少噪音感知。

Conclusion: BNMusic通过生成个性化音乐，显著改善了声学体验，为声学掩蔽提供了新思路。

Abstract: While being disturbed by environmental noises, the acoustic masking technique
is a conventional way to reduce the annoyance in audio engineering that seeks
to cover up the noises with other dominant yet less intrusive sounds. However,
misalignment between the dominant sound and the noise-such as mismatched
downbeats-often requires an excessive volume increase to achieve effective
masking. Motivated by recent advances in cross-modal generation, in this work,
we introduce an alternative method to acoustic masking, aiming to reduce the
noticeability of environmental noises by blending them into personalized music
generated based on user-provided text prompts. Following the paradigm of music
generation using mel-spectrogram representations, we propose a Blending Noises
into Personalized Music (BNMusic) framework with two key stages. The first
stage synthesizes a complete piece of music in a mel-spectrogram representation
that encapsulates the musical essence of the noise. In the second stage, we
adaptively amplify the generated music segment to further reduce noise
perception and enhance the blending effectiveness, while preserving auditory
quality. Our experiments with comprehensive evaluations on MusicBench,
EPIC-SOUNDS, and ESC-50 demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework,
highlighting the ability to blend environmental noise with rhythmically
aligned, adaptively amplified, and enjoyable music segments, minimizing the
noticeability of the noise, thereby improving overall acoustic experiences.

Abstract: Keyphrase generation refers to the task of producing a set of words or
phrases that summarises the content of a document. Continuous efforts have been
dedicated to this task over the past few years, spreading across multiple lines
of research, such as model architectures, data resources, and use-case
scenarios. Yet, the current state of keyphrase generation remains unknown as
there has been no attempt to review and analyse previous work. In this paper,
we bridge this gap by presenting an analysis of over 50 research papers on
keyphrase generation, offering a comprehensive overview of recent progress,
limitations, and open challenges. Our findings highlight several critical
issues in current evaluation practices, such as the concerning similarity among
commonly-used benchmark datasets and inconsistencies in metric calculations
leading to overestimated performances. Additionally, we address the limited
availability of pre-trained models by releasing a strong PLM-based model for
keyphrase generation as an effort to facilitate future research.

Result: 研究发现合成测试集在评估中可能存在显著偏见，但对相对系统性能比较的影响较小。

Conclusion: 合成测试集可用于IR系统评估，但需注意其偏见对绝对性能评估的影响。

Abstract: Test collections are crucial for evaluating Information Retrieval (IR)
systems. Creating a diverse set of user queries for these collections can be
challenging, and obtaining relevance judgments, which indicate how well
retrieved documents match a query, is often costly and resource-intensive.
Recently, generating synthetic datasets using Large Language Models (LLMs) has
gained attention in various applications. While previous work has used LLMs to
generate synthetic queries or documents to improve ranking models, using LLMs
to create synthetic test collections is still relatively unexplored. Previous
work~\cite{rahmani2024synthetic} showed that synthetic test collections have
the potential to be used for system evaluation, however, more analysis is
needed to validate this claim. In this paper, we thoroughly investigate the
reliability of synthetic test collections constructed using LLMs, where LLMs
are used to generate synthetic queries, labels, or both. In particular, we
examine the potential biases that might occur when such test collections are
used for evaluation. We first empirically show the presence of such bias in
evaluation results and analyse the effects it might have on system evaluation.
We further validate the presence of such bias using a linear mixed-effects
model. Our analysis shows that while the effect of bias present in evaluation
results obtained using synthetic test collections could be significant, for
e.g.~computing absolute system performance, its effect may not be as
significant in comparing relative system performance. Codes and data are

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于对比学习的矩阵补全方法（MCCL），通过提取局部邻域子图并生成两种不同的图表示，结合去噪和特征对齐，提高了模型的泛化能力和预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于图神经网络（GNN）的矩阵补全方法对噪声边敏感且容易过拟合，限制了其泛化能力。

Method: MCCL方法提取局部邻域子图，生成两种图表示：一种通过注意力机制去噪，另一种通过图变分自编码器对齐特征分布。通过互学习损失函数协调两种表示。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上，MCCL在预测分数（RMSE提升0.8%）和排名指标（提升36%）上均表现优异。

Conclusion: MCCL通过对比学习显著提升了矩阵补全的泛化能力和预测效果。

Abstract: Matrix completion is a widely adopted framework in recommender systems, as
predicting the missing entries in the user-item rating matrix enables a
comprehensive understanding of user preferences. However, current graph neural
network (GNN)-based approaches are highly sensitive to noisy or irrelevant
edges--due to their inherent message-passing mechanisms--and are prone to
overfitting, which limits their generalizability. To overcome these challenges,
we propose a novel method called Matrix Completion using Contrastive Learning
(MCCL). Our approach begins by extracting local neighborhood subgraphs for each
interaction and subsequently generates two distinct graph representations. The
first representation emphasizes denoising by integrating GNN layers with an
attention mechanism, while the second is obtained via a graph variational
autoencoder that aligns the feature distribution with a standard prior. A
mutual learning loss function is employed during training to gradually
harmonize these representations, enabling the model to capture common patterns
and significantly enhance its generalizability. Extensive experiments on
several real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach not only improves the
numerical accuracy of the predicted scores--achieving up to a 0.8% improvement
in RMSE--but also produces superior rankings with improvements of up to 36% in
ranking metrics.

<details>

Motivation: 现有GNN-based KGRS在稀疏交互场景下性能不佳，复杂模型和机制（如注意力）可能增加学习难度。

Method: LightKG采用简化GNN层（标量对编码）和线性聚合框架，并引入高效对比层直接最小化节点相似性。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上，LightKG平均推荐准确率提升5.8%，训练时间减少84.3%。

Conclusion: LightKG在稀疏和密集场景下均优于现有KGRS，且训练效率显著提升。

Abstract: Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become the dominant approach for
Knowledge Graph-aware Recommender Systems (KGRSs) due to their proven
effectiveness. Building upon GNN-based KGRSs, Self-Supervised Learning (SSL)
has been incorporated to address the sparity issue, leading to longer training
time. However, through extensive experiments, we reveal that: (1)compared to
other KGRSs, the existing GNN-based KGRSs fail to keep their superior
performance under sparse interactions even with SSL. (2) More complex models
tend to perform worse in sparse interaction scenarios and complex mechanisms,
like attention mechanism, can be detrimental as they often increase learning
difficulty. Inspired by these findings, we propose LightKG, a simple yet
powerful GNN-based KGRS to address sparsity issues. LightKG includes a
simplified GNN layer that encodes directed relations as scalar pairs rather
than dense embeddings and employs a linear aggregation framework, greatly
reducing the complexity of GNNs. Additionally, LightKG incorporates an
efficient contrastive layer to implement SSL. It directly minimizes the node
similarity in original graph, avoiding the time-consuming subgraph generation
and comparison required in previous SSL methods. Experiments on four benchmark
datasets show that LightKG outperforms 12 competitive KGRSs in both sparse and
dense scenarios while significantly reducing training time. Specifically, it
surpasses the best baselines by an average of 5.8\% in recommendation accuracy
and saves 84.3\% of training time compared to KGRSs with SSL. Our code is

Motivation: 数字游戏中长期用户价值（LTV）预测对盈利策略至关重要，但现有方法因延迟支付行为、稀疏数据和异常值而表现不佳。

Method: SHORE结合短期预测任务（如LTV-15和LTV-30）作为辅助任务，并采用混合损失函数（包括保序多类分类和动态Huber损失）来减少零膨胀和异常值的影响。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验表明，SHORE在在线部署中减少了47.91%的预测误差，显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: SHORE在工业级LTV预测中表现出高效性和鲁棒性，适用于数字游戏的盈利策略。

Abstract: In digital gaming, long-term user lifetime value (LTV) prediction is
essential for monetization strategy, yet presents major challenges due to
delayed payment behavior, sparse early user data, and the presence of
high-value outliers. While existing models typically rely on either short-cycle
observations or strong distributional assumptions, such approaches often
underestimate long-term value or suffer from poor robustness. To address these
issues, we propose SHort-cycle auxiliary with Order-preserving REgression
(SHORE), a novel LTV prediction framework that integrates short-horizon
predictions (e.g., LTV-15 and LTV-30) as auxiliary tasks to enhance long-cycle
targets (e.g., LTV-60). SHORE also introduces a hybrid loss function combining
order-preserving multi-class classification and a dynamic Huber loss to
mitigate the influence of zero-inflation and outlier payment behavior.
Extensive offline and online experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate
that SHORE significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving a 47.91\%
relative reduction in prediction error in online deployment. These results
highlight SHORE's practical effectiveness and robustness in industrial-scale
LTV prediction for digital games.

Conclusion: MGOE是图基多任务推荐领域的突破性成果，显著提升了推荐系统性能。

Abstract: Graph-based multi-task learning at billion-scale presents a significant
challenge, as different tasks correspond to distinct billion-scale graphs.
Traditional multi-task learning methods often neglect these graph structures,
relying solely on individual user and item embeddings. However, disregarding
graph structures overlooks substantial potential for improving performance. In
this paper, we introduce the Macro Graph of Expert (MGOE) framework, the first
approach capable of leveraging macro graph embeddings to capture task-specific
macro features while modeling the correlations between task-specific experts.
Specifically, we propose the concept of a Macro Graph Bottom, which, for the
first time, enables multi-task learning models to incorporate graph information
effectively. We design the Macro Prediction Tower to dynamically integrate
macro knowledge across tasks. MGOE has been deployed at scale, powering
multi-task learning for the homepage of a leading billion-scale recommender
system. Extensive offline experiments conducted on three public benchmark
datasets demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art multi-task learning
methods, establishing MGOE as a breakthrough in multi-task graph-based
recommendation. Furthermore, online A/B tests confirm the superiority of MGOE
in billion-scale recommender systems.

Conclusion: GCCP在保持效率的同时提升了效果，接近计算密集型方法。

Abstract: Recent advancements have successfully harnessed the power of Large Language
Models (LLMs) for zero-shot document ranking, exploring a variety of prompting
strategies. Comparative approaches like pairwise and listwise achieve high
effectiveness but are computationally intensive and thus less practical for
larger-scale applications. Scoring-based pointwise approaches exhibit superior
efficiency by independently and simultaneously generating the relevance scores
for each candidate document. However, this independence ignores critical
comparative insights between documents, resulting in inconsistent scoring and
suboptimal performance. In this paper, we aim to improve the effectiveness of
pointwise methods while preserving their efficiency through two key
innovations: (1) We propose a novel Global-Consistent Comparative Pointwise
Ranking (GCCP) strategy that incorporates global reference comparisons between
each candidate and an anchor document to generate contrastive relevance scores.
We strategically design the anchor document as a query-focused summary of
pseudo-relevant candidates, which serves as an effective reference point by
capturing the global context for document comparison. (2) These contrastive
relevance scores can be efficiently Post-Aggregated with existing pointwise
methods, seamlessly integrating essential Global Context information in a
training-free manner (PAGC). Extensive experiments on the TREC DL and BEIR
benchmark demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms previous
pointwise methods while maintaining comparable efficiency. Our method also
achieves competitive performance against comparative methods that require
substantially more computational resources. More analyses further validate the
efficacy of our anchor construction strategy.

Conclusion: 广义SSH模型展现出丰富的拓扑现象，为1D拓扑系统研究提供了多角度视角。

Abstract: The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model serves as a canonical example of a
one-dimensional topological insulator, yet its behavior under more complex,
realistic conditions remains a fertile ground for research. This paper presents
a comprehensive computational investigation into generalized SSH models,
exploring the interplay between topology, quasi-periodic disorder,
non-Hermiticity, and time-dependent driving. Using exact diagonalization and
specialized numerical solvers, we map the system's phase space through its
spectral properties and localization characteristics, quantified by the Inverse
Participation Ratio (IPR). We demonstrate that while the standard SSH model
exhibits topologically protected edge states, these are destroyed by a
localization transition induced by strong Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper (AAH)
modulation. Further, we employ unsupervised machine learning (PCA) to
autonomously classify the system's phases, revealing that strong localization
can obscure underlying topological signatures. Extending the model beyond
Hermiticity, we uncover the non-Hermitian skin effect, a dramatic localization
of all bulk states at a boundary. Finally, we apply a periodic Floquet drive to
a topologically trivial chain, successfully engineering a Floquet topological
insulator characterized by the emergence of anomalous edge states at the
boundaries of the quasi-energy zone. These findings collectively provide a
multi-faceted view of the rich phenomena hosted in generalized 1D topological
systems.

viability of next-generation solid state batteries. However, challenges persist
due to difficulties in experimentally characterizing buried interfaces and
limits in simulation speed and accuracy. We conduct large-scale explicit
reactive simulations with quantum accuracy for a symmetric battery cell,
{\symcell}, enabled by active learning and deep equivariant neural network
interatomic potentials. To automatically characterize the coupled reactions and
interdiffusion at the interface, we formulate and use unsupervised
classification techniques based on clustering in the space of local atomic
environments. Our analysis reveals the formation of a previously unreported
crystalline disordered phase, Li$_2$S$_{0.72}$P$_{0.14}$Cl$_{0.14}$, in the
SEI, that evaded previous predictions based purely on thermodynamics,
underscoring the importance of explicit modeling of full reaction and transport
kinetics. Our simulations agree with and explain experimental observations of
the SEI formations and elucidate the Li creep mechanisms, critical to dendrite
initiation, characterized by significant Li motion along the interface. Our
approach is to crease a digital twin from first principles, without adjustable
parameters fitted to experiment. As such, it offers capabilities to gain
insights into atomistic dynamics governing complex heterogeneous processes in
solid-state synthesis and electrochemistry.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于最小深度的阈值方案，用于在双重不平衡条件下进行特征选择，提高了随机森林中变量选择的稳定性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高维分类任务中，双重不平衡（类别不平衡和维度不对称）导致传统特征选择方法在随机森林中表现不稳定或误导。

Method: 利用树拓扑结构评估变量相关性，提出基于最小深度的阈值方案。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据集上的实验表明，该方法比传统最小深度选择更简洁且准确。

Conclusion: 该方法为双重不平衡条件下的变量选择提供了实用且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Feature selection is a critical step in high-dimensional classification
tasks, particularly under challenging conditions of double imbalance, namely
settings characterized by both class imbalance in the response variable and
dimensional asymmetry in the data $(n \gg p)$. In such scenarios, traditional
feature selection methods applied to Random Forests (RF) often yield unstable
or misleading importance rankings. This paper proposes a novel thresholding
scheme for feature selection based on minimal depth, which exploits the tree
topology to assess variable relevance. Extensive experiments on simulated and
real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach produces more
parsimonious and accurate subsets of variables compared to conventional minimal
depth-based selection. The method provides a practical and interpretable
solution for variable selection in RF under double imbalance conditions.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度强化学习（DRL）的自动化IMPT重新规划框架，通过个性化训练提升头颈癌治疗计划质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 头颈癌治疗中解剖结构变化可能导致剂量分布偏差，手动重新规划耗时耗力，需自动化解决方案。

Method: 采用DQN和PPO两种DRL算法，基于患者CT和模拟解剖变化数据，通过调整优化优先级最大化计划质量。

Result: 实验显示DRL显著提升计划评分（DQN:139.78，PPO:142.74），优于人工重新规划（137.20）。

Conclusion: DRL框架有效解决质子治疗中的几何和剂量学挑战，为自适应治疗提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Anatomical changes during intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) for
head-and-neck cancer (HNC) can shift Bragg peaks, risking tumor underdosing and
organ-at-risk overdosing. As a result, treatment replanning is often required
to maintain clinically acceptable treatment quality. However, current manual
replanning processes are resource-intensive and time-consuming. We propose a
patient-specific deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for automated IMPT
replanning, with a reward-shaping mechanism based on a $150$-point plan quality
score addressing competing clinical objectives. We formulate the planning
process as an RL problem where agents learn control policies to adjust
optimization priorities, maximizing plan quality. Unlike population-based
approaches, our framework trains personalized agents for each patient using
their planning CT (Computed Tomography) and augmented anatomies simulating
anatomical changes (tumor progression and regression). This patient-specific
approach leverages anatomical similarities throughout treatment, enabling
effective plan adaptation. We implemented two DRL algorithms, Deep Q-Network
and Proximal Policy Optimization, using dose-volume histograms (DVHs) as state
representations and a $22$-dimensional action space of priority adjustments.
Evaluation on five HNC patients using actual replanning CT data showed both DRL
agents improved initial plan scores from $120.63 \pm 21.40$ to $139.78 \pm
6.84$ (DQN) and $142.74 \pm 5.16$ (PPO), surpassing manual replans generated by
a human planner ($137.20 \pm 5.58$). Clinical validation confirms that
improvements translate to better tumor coverage and OAR sparing across diverse
anatomical changes. This work demonstrates DRL's potential in addressing
geometric and dosimetric complexities of adaptive proton therapy, offering
efficient offline adaptation solutions and advancing online adaptive proton
therapy.

Motivation: 心脏亚结构在胸部放疗规划中至关重要，但现有深度学习方法在多模态和重叠结构上泛化能力不足。

Method: MAGIC采用nnU-Net架构，通过复制的编码和解码分支实现多模态分割，训练数据涵盖Sim-CT、MR-Linac和CCTA三种模态。

Result: MAGIC在57%的案例中优于对比模型，平均DSC得分为0.75(Sim-CT)、0.68(MR-Linac)和0.80(CCTA)。

Abstract: Cardiac substructures are essential in thoracic radiation therapy planning to
minimize risk of radiation-induced heart disease. Deep learning (DL) offers
efficient methods to reduce contouring burden but lacks generalizability across
different modalities and overlapping structures. This work introduces and
validates a Modality-AGnostic Image Cascade (MAGIC) for comprehensive and
multi-modal cardiac substructure segmentation. MAGIC is implemented through
replicated encoding and decoding branches of an nnU-Net-based, U-shaped
backbone conserving the function of a single model. Twenty cardiac
substructures (heart, chambers, great vessels (GVs), valves, coronary arteries
(CAs), and conduction nodes) from simulation CT (Sim-CT), low-field MR-Linac,
and cardiac CT angiography (CCTA) modalities were manually delineated and used
to train (n=76), validate (n=15), and test (n=30) MAGIC. Twelve comparison
models (four segmentation subgroups across three modalities) were equivalently
trained. All methods were compared for training efficiency and against
reference contours using the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and two-tailed
Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test (threshold, p<0.05). Average DSC scores were
0.75(0.16) for Sim-CT, 0.68(0.21) for MR-Linac, and 0.80(0.16) for CCTA. MAGIC
outperforms the comparison in 57% of cases, with limited statistical
differences. MAGIC offers an effective and accurate segmentation solution that
is lightweight and capable of segmenting multiple modalities and overlapping
structures in a single model. MAGIC further enables clinical implementation by
simplifying the computational requirements and offering unparalleled
flexibility for clinical settings.

Conclusion: 研究为优化神经形态网络学习复杂动态系统提供了实用方法，仅需外部控制参数即可实现。

Abstract: This study investigates how dynamical systems may be learned and modelled
with a neuromorphic network which is itself a dynamical system. The
neuromorphic network used in this study is based on a complex electrical
circuit comprised of memristive elements that produce neuro-synaptic nonlinear
responses to input electrical signals. To determine how computation may be
performed using the physics of the underlying system, the neuromorphic network
was simulated and evaluated on autonomous prediction of a multivariate chaotic
time series, implemented with a reservoir computing framework. Through
manipulating only input electrodes and voltages, optimal nonlinear dynamical
responses were found when input voltages maximise the number of memristive
components whose internal dynamics explore the entire dynamical range of the
memristor model. Increasing the network coverage with the input electrodes was
found to suppress other nonlinear responses that are less conducive to
learning. These results provide valuable insights into how a practical
neuromorphic network device can be optimised for learning complex dynamical
systems using only external control parameters.

Abstract: We investigate the phase diagram and memory retrieval capabilities of
bipartite energy-based neural networks, namely Restricted Boltzmann Machines
(RBMs), as a function of the prior distribution imposed on their hidden units -
including binary, multi-state, and ReLU-like activations. Drawing connections
to the Hopfield model and employing analytical tools from statistical physics
of disordered systems, we explore how the architectural choices and activation
functions shape the thermodynamic properties of these models. Our analysis
reveals that standard RBMs with binary hidden nodes and extensive connectivity
suffer from reduced critical capacity, limiting their effectiveness as
associative memories. To address this, we examine several modifications, such
as introducing local biases and adopting richer hidden unit priors. These
adjustments restore ordered retrieval phases and markedly improve recall
performance, even at finite temperatures. Our theoretical findings, supported
by finite-size Monte Carlo simulations, highlight the importance of hidden unit
design in enhancing the expressive power of RBMs.

Conclusion: 该方法为动力学方程的大规模不确定性量化提供了高效且物理一致的解决方案。

Abstract: The high dimensionality of kinetic equations with stochastic parameters poses
major computational challenges for uncertainty quantification (UQ). Traditional
Monte Carlo (MC) sampling methods, while widely used, suffer from slow
convergence and high variance, which become increasingly severe as the
dimensionality of the parameter space grows. To accelerate MC sampling, we
adopt a multiscale control variates strategy that leverages low-fidelity
solutions from simplified kinetic models to reduce variance. To further improve
sampling efficiency and preserve the underlying physics, we introduce surrogate
models based on structure and asymptotic preserving neural networks (SAPNNs).
These deep neural networks are specifically designed to satisfy key physical
properties, including positivity, conservation laws, entropy dissipation, and
asymptotic limits. By training the SAPNNs on low-fidelity models and enriching
them with selected high-fidelity samples from the full Boltzmann equation, our
method achieves significant variance reduction while maintaining physical
consistency and asymptotic accuracy. The proposed methodology enables efficient
large-scale prediction in kinetic UQ and is validated across both homogeneous
and nonhomogeneous multiscale regimes. Numerical results demonstrate improved
accuracy and computational efficiency compared to standard MC techniques.

Abstract: A modern digital pathology vendor-agnostic binary slide format specifically
targeting the unmet need of efficient real-time transfer and display has not
yet been established. Growing adoption of digital pathology only intensifies
the need for an intermediary digital slide format with an emphasis on
performance for use between slide servers and image management software or for
inter-institutional transmission of cases. Although the DICOM standard is a
well-established format widely used for long-term storage of both images and
critically associated metadata, its inherent limitations on maximum image
dimensions can impact retrieval speed, particularly when accessing whole slide
images using a pyramidal structure of slide viewer applications. Here, we
introduce the Iris file extension, a binary file container specification
explicitly designed for whole slide image systems that can abstract the file
structure outline into memory for immediate tile access. The Iris file
extension adds modern compression support, a dynamic structure with optional
file features, computationally trivial deep file validation and corruption
recovery capabilities, and slide annotation support. In addition to the file
specification document, we provide source code to allow for (de)serialization
and validation of a binary stream against the standard and corresponding binary
builds with C++, Python, and JavaScript language bindings. We further provide
full encoder and decoder implementation source code, as well as binary builds
(as part of the separate Iris Codec Community module) with language bindings
for C++ and Python to allow for easy integration with existing WSI solutions.

Motivation: 动态MRI具有时空对称性，现有方法未能充分利用时间对称性，导致重建效果受限。

Method: 提出DUN-SRE网络，结合(2+1)D等变卷积架构，统一数据一致性和近端映射模块，确保时空对称性约束。

Result: 在心脏CINE MRI数据集上表现优异，尤其在保留旋转对称结构方面。

Conclusion: DUN-SRE在动态MRI重建任务中具有广泛适用性和强泛化能力。

Abstract: Dynamic Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) exhibits transformation symmetries,
including spatial rotation symmetry within individual frames and temporal
symmetry along the time dimension. Explicit incorporation of these symmetry
priors in the reconstruction model can significantly improve image quality,
especially under aggressive undersampling scenarios. Recently, Equivariant
convolutional neural network (ECNN) has shown great promise in exploiting
spatial symmetry priors. However, existing ECNNs critically fail to model
temporal symmetry, arguably the most universal and informative structural prior
in dynamic MRI reconstruction. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel Deep
Unrolling Network with Spatiotemporal Rotation Equivariance (DUN-SRE) for
Dynamic MRI Reconstruction. The DUN-SRE establishes spatiotemporal equivariance
through a (2+1)D equivariant convolutional architecture. In particular, it
integrates both the data consistency and proximal mapping module into a unified
deep unrolling framework. This architecture ensures rigorous propagation of
spatiotemporal rotation symmetry constraints throughout the reconstruction
process, enabling more physically accurate modeling of cardiac motion dynamics
in cine MRI. In addition, a high-fidelity group filter parameterization
mechanism is developed to maintain representation precision while enforcing
symmetry constraints. Comprehensive experiments on Cardiac CINE MRI datasets
demonstrate that DUN-SRE achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in
preserving rotation-symmetric structures, offering strong generalization
capability to a broad range of dynamic MRI reconstruction tasks.

Abstract: Precise segmentation of brain tumors, particularly contrast-enhancing regions
visible in post-contrast MRI (areas highlighted by contrast agent injection),
is crucial for accurate clinical diagnosis and treatment planning but remains
challenging. However, current methods exhibit notable performance degradation
in segmenting these enhancing brain tumor areas, largely due to insufficient
consideration of MRI-specific tumor features such as complex textures and
directional variations. To address this, we propose the Harmonized Frequency
Fusion Network (HFF-Net), which rethinks brain tumor segmentation from a
frequency-domain perspective. To comprehensively characterize tumor regions, we
develop a Frequency Domain Decomposition (FDD) module that separates MRI images
into low-frequency components, capturing smooth tumor contours and
high-frequency components, highlighting detailed textures and directional
edges. To further enhance sensitivity to tumor boundaries, we introduce an
Adaptive Laplacian Convolution (ALC) module that adaptively emphasizes critical
high-frequency details using dynamically updated convolution kernels. To
effectively fuse tumor features across multiple scales, we design a Frequency
Domain Cross-Attention (FDCA) integrating semantic, positional, and
slice-specific information. We further validate and interpret frequency-domain
improvements through visualization, theoretical reasoning, and experimental
analyses. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that
HFF-Net achieves an average relative improvement of 4.48\% (ranging from 2.39\%
to 7.72\%) in the mean Dice scores across the three major subregions, and an
average relative improvement of 7.33% (ranging from 5.96% to 8.64%) in the
segmentation of contrast-enhancing tumor regions, while maintaining favorable
computational efficiency and clinical applicability. Code:

Conclusion: CCELLA在医学图像生成中表现出色，解决了数据稀缺问题，提升了生成质量和下游任务性能。

Abstract: Latent diffusion models (LDM) could alleviate data scarcity challenges
affecting machine learning development for medical imaging. However, medical
LDM training typically relies on performance- or scientific
accessibility-limiting strategies including a reliance on short-prompt text
encoders, the reuse of non-medical LDMs, or a requirement for fine-tuning with
large data volumes. We propose a Class-Conditioned Efficient Large Language
model Adapter (CCELLA) to address these limitations. CCELLA is a novel
dual-head conditioning approach that simultaneously conditions the LDM U-Net
with non-medical large language model-encoded text features through
cross-attention and with pathology classification through the timestep
embedding. We also propose a joint loss function and a data-efficient LDM
training framework. In combination, these strategies enable
pathology-conditioned LDM training for high-quality medical image synthesis
given limited data volume and human data annotation, improving LDM performance
and scientific accessibility. Our method achieves a 3D FID score of 0.025 on a
size-limited prostate MRI dataset, significantly outperforming a recent
foundation model with FID 0.071. When training a classifier for prostate cancer
prediction, adding synthetic images generated by our method to the training
dataset improves classifier accuracy from 69% to 74%. Training a classifier
solely on our method's synthetic images achieved comparable performance to
training on real images alone.

Abstract: Supervised machine learning has enabled accurate pathology detection in brain
MRI, but requires training data from diseased subjects that may not be readily
available in some scenarios, for example, in the case of rare diseases.
Reconstruction-based unsupervised anomaly detection, in particular using
diffusion models, has gained popularity in the medical field as it allows for
training on healthy images alone, eliminating the need for large
disease-specific cohorts. These methods assume that a model trained on normal
data cannot accurately represent or reconstruct anomalies. However, this
assumption often fails with models failing to reconstruct healthy tissue or
accurately reconstruct abnormal regions i.e., failing to remove anomalies. In
this work, we introduce a novel conditional diffusion model framework for
anomaly detection and healthy image reconstruction in brain MRI. Our weakly
supervised approach integrates synthetically generated pseudo-pathology images
into the modeling process to better guide the reconstruction of healthy images.
To generate these pseudo-pathologies, we apply fluid-driven anomaly
randomization to augment real pathology segmentation maps from an auxiliary
dataset, ensuring that the synthetic anomalies are both realistic and
anatomically coherent. We evaluate our model's ability to detect pathology,
using both synthetic anomaly datasets and real pathology from the ATLAS
dataset. In our extensive experiments, our model: (i) consistently outperforms
variational autoencoders, and conditional and unconditional latent diffusion;
and (ii) surpasses on most datasets, the performance of supervised inpainting
methods with access to paired diseased/healthy images.

Abstract: Recent advances in medical imaging have established deep learning-based
segmentation as the predominant approach, though it typically requires large
amounts of manually annotated data. However, obtaining annotations for
intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) remains particularly challenging due to the
tedious and costly labeling process. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged
as a promising solution to address the scarcity of labeled data, especially in
volumetric medical image segmentation. Unlike conventional SSL methods that
primarily focus on high-confidence pseudo-labels or consistency regularization,
we propose SWDL-Net, a novel SSL framework that exploits the complementary
advantages of Laplacian pyramid and deep convolutional upsampling. The
Laplacian pyramid excels at edge sharpening, while deep convolutions enhance
detail precision through flexible feature mapping. Our framework achieves
superior segmentation of lesion details and boundaries through a difference
learning mechanism that effectively integrates these complementary approaches.
Extensive experiments on a 271-case ICH dataset and public benchmarks
demonstrate that SWDL-Net outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in
scenarios with only 2% labeled data. Additional evaluations on the publicly
available Brain Hemorrhage Segmentation Dataset (BHSD) with 5% labeled data
further confirm the superiority of our approach. Code and data have been

Result: 实验表明，ConStyX在多域数据上表现出优越的泛化性能。

Conclusion: ConStyX有效解决了域泛化问题，提升了医学图像分割模型的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Medical images are usually collected from multiple domains, leading to domain
shifts that impair the performance of medical image segmentation models. Domain
Generalization (DG) aims to address this issue by training a robust model with
strong generalizability. Recently, numerous domain randomization-based DG
methods have been proposed. However, these methods suffer from the following
limitations: 1) constrained efficiency of domain randomization due to their
exclusive dependence on image style perturbation, and 2) neglect of the adverse
effects of over-augmented images on model training. To address these issues, we
propose a novel domain randomization-based DG method, called content style
augmentation (ConStyX), for generalizable medical image segmentation.
Specifically, ConStyX 1) augments the content and style of training data,
allowing the augmented training data to better cover a wider range of data
domains, and 2) leverages well-augmented features while mitigating the negative
effects of over-augmented features during model training. Extensive experiments
across multiple domains demonstrate that our ConStyX achieves superior
generalization performance. The code is available at

Abstract: Following the successful paradigm shift of large language models, leveraging
pre-training on a massive corpus of data and fine-tuning on different
downstream tasks, generalist models have made their foray into computer vision.
The introduction of Segment Anything Model (SAM) set a milestone on
segmentation of natural images, inspiring the design of a multitude of
architectures for medical image segmentation. In this survey we offer a
comprehensive and in-depth investigation on generalist models for medical image
segmentation. We start with an introduction on the fundamentals concepts
underpinning their development. Then, we provide a taxonomy on the different
declinations of SAM in terms of zero-shot, few-shot, fine-tuning, adapters, on
the recent SAM 2, on other innovative models trained on images alone, and
others trained on both text and images. We thoroughly analyze their
performances at the level of both primary research and best-in-literature,
followed by a rigorous comparison with the state-of-the-art task-specific
models. We emphasize the need to address challenges in terms of compliance with
regulatory frameworks, privacy and security laws, budget, and trustworthy
artificial intelligence (AI). Finally, we share our perspective on future
directions concerning synthetic data, early fusion, lessons learnt from
generalist models in natural language processing, agentic AI and physical AI,
and clinical translation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学图像分割方法（CNN、Transformer及混合架构）各有局限性，RWKV模型因其线性计算复杂度和长程建模能力成为新选择，但尚未充分探索预训练VRWKV的潜力。

Method: 提出Med-URWKV，基于U-Net框架，结合ImageNet预训练的VRWKV编码器，首次在医学领域实现纯RWKV分割模型。

Result: 在七个数据集上，Med-URWKV性能优于或媲美从头训练的RWKV模型，验证了预训练编码器的有效性。

Conclusion: Med-URWKV展示了预训练RWKV在医学图像分割中的潜力，代码将开源。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a fundamental and key technology in
computer-aided diagnosis and treatment. Previous methods can be broadly
classified into three categories: convolutional neural network (CNN) based,
Transformer based, and hybrid architectures that combine both. However, each of
them has its own limitations, such as restricted receptive fields in CNNs or
the computational overhead caused by the quadratic complexity of Transformers.
Recently, the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) model has emerged as a
promising alternative for various vision tasks, offering strong long-range
modeling capabilities with linear computational complexity. Some studies have
also adapted RWKV to medical image segmentation tasks, achieving competitive
performance. However, most of these studies focus on modifications to the
Vision-RWKV (VRWKV) mechanism and train models from scratch, without exploring
the potential advantages of leveraging pre-trained VRWKV models for medical
image segmentation tasks. In this paper, we propose Med-URWKV, a pure
RWKV-based architecture built upon the U-Net framework, which incorporates
ImageNet-based pretraining to further explore the potential of RWKV in medical
image segmentation tasks. To the best of our knowledge, Med-URWKV is the first
pure RWKV segmentation model in the medical field that can directly reuse a
large-scale pre-trained VRWKV encoder. Experimental results on seven datasets
demonstrate that Med-URWKV achieves comparable or even superior segmentation
performance compared to other carefully optimized RWKV models trained from
scratch. This validates the effectiveness of using a pretrained VRWKV encoder
in enhancing model performance. The codes will be released.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于深度学习的AI算法，用于数字病理学中的质量保证，通过分析切片并分类10种预定义伪影或背景，提高伪影检测的准确性和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字病理学中的质量保证是一个关键但未被充分探索的领域，现有工具未充分利用深度学习技术。伪影对AI诊断模型的性能有负面影响，亟需创新方法。

Method: 提出一种AI算法，通过分析切片并分类伪影类型，生成伪影地图以指导人工检查。使用InceptionResNet模型，在不同切片大小和放大倍数下进行消融研究。

Result: 通过实验验证，提出了一种混合设计，结合单伪影二元模型和多实例模型，优化了伪影检测效果。

Conclusion: 该算法显著减少了人工检查时间，为数字病理学质量保证提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Quality assurance is a critical but underexplored area in digital pathology,
where even minor artifacts can have significant effects. Artifacts have been
shown to negatively impact the performance of AI diagnostic models. In current
practice, trained staff manually review digitized images prior to release of
these slides to pathologists which are then used to render a diagnosis.
Conventional image processing approaches, provide a foundation for detecting
artifacts on digital pathology slides. However, current tools do not leverage
deep learning, which has the potential to improve detection accuracy and
scalability. Despite these advancements, methods for quality assurance in
digital pathology remain limited, presenting a gap for innovation.
  We propose an AI algorithm designed to screen digital pathology slides by
analyzing tiles and categorizing them into one of 10 predefined artifact types
or as background. This algorithm identifies and localizes artifacts, creating a
map that highlights regions of interest. By directing human operators to
specific tiles affected by artifacts, the algorithm minimizes the time and
effort required to manually review entire slides for quality issues.
  From internal archives and The Cancer Genome Atlas, 133 whole slide images
were selected and 10 artifacts were annotated using an internally developed
software ZAPP (Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL). Ablation study of multiple
models at different tile sizes and magnification was performed. InceptionResNet
was selected. Single artifact models were trained and tested, followed by a
limited multiple instance model with artifacts that performed well together
(chatter, fold, and pen). From the results of this study we suggest a hybrid
design for artifact screening composed of both single artifact binary models as
well as multiple instance models to optimize detection of each artifact.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于SNR和计算资源自适应的分布式CNN框架，通过智能遗传算法优化网络配置，显著提升了低信噪比和有限计算资源下的分类精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有固定分割DNN和静态配置方法无法适应动态计算预算和信道条件的问题。

Method: 采用学习辅助智能遗传算法（LAIGA）优化CNN超参数空间，结合随机森林学习辅助避免无效探索。

Result: 在低SNR（-10dB）和有限计算资源（1M至70M FLOPs）下，分类精度比现有方法提升10%。

Conclusion: 提出的自适应框架在动态环境中表现优越，为IoT设备与边缘服务器的无线图像分类提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Sensor-based local inference at IoT devices faces severe computational
limitations, often requiring data transmission over noisy wireless channels for
server-side processing. To address this, split-network Deep Neural Network
(DNN) based Joint Source-Channel Coding (JSCC) schemes are used to extract and
transmit relevant features instead of raw data. However, most existing methods
rely on fixed network splits and static configurations, lacking adaptability to
varying computational budgets and channel conditions. In this paper, we propose
a novel SNR- and computation-adaptive distributed CNN framework for wireless
image classification across IoT devices and edge servers. We introduce a
learning-assisted intelligent Genetic Algorithm (LAIGA) that efficiently
explores the CNN hyperparameter space to optimize network configuration under
given FLOPs constraints and given SNR. LAIGA intelligently discards the
infeasible network configurations that exceed computational budget at IoT
device. It also benefits from the Random Forests based learning assistance to
avoid a thorough exploration of hyperparameter space and to induce application
specific bias in candidate optimal configurations. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms fixed-split architectures
and existing SNR-adaptive methods, especially under low SNR and limited
computational resources. We achieve a 10\% increase in classification accuracy
as compared to existing JSCC based SNR-adaptive multilayer framework at an SNR
as low as -10dB across a range of available computational budget (1M to 70M
FLOPs) at IoT device.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于CUDA生态在并行计算中的主导地位，其他硬件平台需要支持CUDA代码以实现性能可移植性，但现有方法在通用性和开发成本上存在局限。

Method: 提出了一种结合AI编译器和自动优化技术的新框架，并引入图数据增强方法和HPCTransEval基准测试。

Result: 实验表明，该框架显著提升了LLM在CUDA转译中的性能，尤其是在CUDA到CPU的转译任务中。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了LLM在解决CUDA生态兼容性问题中的潜力，为高性能代码转译提供了新思路。

Abstract: The rapid growth of deep learning has driven exponential increases in model
parameters and computational demands. NVIDIA GPUs and their CUDA-based software
ecosystem provide robust support for parallel computing, significantly
alleviating computational bottlenecks. Meanwhile, due to the cultivation of
user programming habits and the high performance of GPUs, the CUDA ecosystem
has established a dominant position in the field of parallel software. This
dominance requires other hardware platforms to support CUDA-based software with
performance portability. However, translating CUDA code to other platforms
poses significant challenges due to differences in parallel programming
paradigms and hardware architectures. Existing approaches rely on language
extensions, domain-specific languages (DSLs), or compilers but face limitations
in workload coverage and generalizability. Moreover, these methods often incur
substantial development costs. Recently, LLMs have demonstrated extraordinary
potential in various vertical domains, especially in code-related tasks.
However, the performance of existing LLMs in CUDA transpilation, particularly
for high-performance code, remains suboptimal. The main reason for this
limitation lies in the lack of high-quality training datasets. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel framework for generating high-performance CUDA
and corresponding platform code pairs, leveraging AI compiler and automatic
optimization technology. We further enhance the framework with a graph-based
data augmentation method and introduce HPCTransEval, a benchmark for evaluating
LLM performance on CUDA transpilation. We conduct experiments using CUDA-to-CPU
transpilation as a case study on leading LLMs. The result demonstrates that our
framework significantly improves CUDA transpilation, highlighting the potential
of LLMs to address compatibility challenges within the CUDA ecosystem.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于对话延续训练的音频理解模型，利用大语言模型的对话能力，解决音频描述中的变异性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决音频描述中的变异性问题，同时实现无需多任务指令调零的指令跟随能力。

Method: 通过对话延续训练，模型学习生成对话式响应而非直接生成目标描述，从而更深入理解音频内容。

Result: 在多个音频数据集和问答测试中，模型展现出对未见指令的零样本跟随能力。

Conclusion: 对话延续训练是一种有效的方法，能够在无需额外指令调优的情况下，提升音频理解模型的指令跟随能力。

Abstract: We propose an instruction-following audio comprehension model that leverages
the dialogue continuation ability of large language models (LLMs). Instead of
directly generating target captions in training data, the proposed method
trains a model to produce responses as if the input caption triggered a
dialogue. This dialogue continuation training mitigates the caption variation
problem. Learning to continue a dialogue effectively captures the caption's
meaning beyond its surface-level words. As a result, our model enables
zero-shot instruction-following capability without multitask instruction
tuning, even trained solely on audio captioning datasets. Experiments on
AudioCaps, WavCaps, and Clotho datasets with AudioBench audio-scene
question-answering tests demonstrate our model's ability to follow various
unseen instructions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前ASR系统大多仅关注语音转录，而忽略了说话人角色识别，这对对话AI至关重要。

Method: 通过为Whisper模型添加角色特定标记，并使用SOT进行微调，实现联合ASR和说话人角色标注。

Result: 在两个真实对话数据集上，该方法比基线方法降低了10%以上的多说话人WER。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了作为统一模型实现说话人角色感知语音转录的可行性。

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition systems have made significant progress with
large-scale pre-trained models. However, most current systems focus solely on
transcribing the speech without identifying speaker roles, a function that is
critical for conversational AI. In this work, we investigate the use of
serialized output training (SOT) for joint ASR and speaker role tagging. By
augmenting Whisper with role-specific tokens and fine-tuning it with SOT, we
enable the model to generate role-aware transcriptions in a single decoding
pass. We compare the SOT approach against a self-supervised previous baseline
method on two real-world conversational datasets. Our findings show that this
approach achieves more than 10% reduction in multi-talker WER, demonstrating
its feasibility as a unified model for speaker-role aware speech transcription.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于数据稀缺和域不匹配（如不同电子听诊器、患者群体和录音环境），呼吸音分类性能难以提升。

Method: 设计了双编码器的DDE-MAE模型，分别捕捉疾病相关和无关信息，实现特征解耦。

Result: 在ICBHI数据集上取得了有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: DDE-MAE通过特征解耦有效减少了域不匹配问题，提升了呼吸音分类性能。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have been applied to audio spectrograms for respiratory
sound classification, but it remains challenging to achieve satisfactory
performance due to the scarcity of available data. Moreover, domain mismatch
may be introduced into the trained models as a result of the respiratory sound
samples being collected from various electronic stethoscopes, patient
demographics, and recording environments. To tackle this issue, we proposed a
modified MaskedAutoencoder(MAE) model, named Disentangling Dual-Encoder MAE
(DDE-MAE) for respiratory sound classification. Two independent encoders were
designed to capture disease-related and disease-irrelevant information
separately, achieving feature disentanglement to reduce the domain mismatch.
Our method achieves a competitive performance on the ICBHI dataset.

Abstract: Voice conversion has emerged as a pivotal technology in numerous applications
ranging from assistive communication to entertainment. In this paper, we
present RT-VC, a zero-shot real-time voice conversion system that delivers
ultra-low latency and high-quality performance. Our approach leverages an
articulatory feature space to naturally disentangle content and speaker
characteristics, facilitating more robust and interpretable voice
transformations. Additionally, the integration of differentiable digital signal
processing (DDSP) enables efficient vocoding directly from articulatory
features, significantly reducing conversion latency. Experimental evaluations
demonstrate that, while maintaining synthesis quality comparable to the current
state-of-the-art (SOTA) method, RT-VC achieves a CPU latency of 61.4 ms,
representing a 13.3\% reduction in latency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音识别器通常在特定环境下表现最佳，但适配到新环境（如新说话人）时，数据量少且无标签，导致传统方法不鲁棒。

Method: 1. 使用条件熵作为损失函数，基于完整假设而非单一伪标签；2. 引入短向量形式的说话人编码，减少数据需求。

Result: 在远场噪声增强的Common Voice数据集上，1分钟适配数据下词错误率相对降低20%，10分钟时提升至29%。

Conclusion: 该方法在少量数据下显著提升了语音识别器的适配鲁棒性。

Abstract: Speech recognisers usually perform optimally only in a specific environment
and need to be adapted to work well in another. For adaptation to a new
speaker, there is often too little data for fine-tuning to be robust, and that
data is usually unlabelled. This paper proposes a combination of approaches to
make adaptation to a single minute of data robust. First, instead of estimating
the adaptation parameters with cross-entropy on a single error-prone hypothesis
or "pseudo-label", this paper proposes a novel loss function, the conditional
entropy over complete hypotheses. Using multiple hypotheses makes adaptation
more robust to errors in the initial recognition. Second, a "speaker code"
characterises a speaker in a vector short enough that it requires little data
to estimate. On a far-field noise-augmented version of Common Voice, the
proposed scheme yields a 20% relative improvement in word error rate on one
minute of adaptation data, increasing on 10 minutes to 29%.

Result: 专用单细胞框架（如scVI、CLAIRE和scGPT）在批校正中表现优异，通用自监督方法（如VICReg和SimCLR）在细胞类型注释和多模态数据整合中更优。随机掩码是最有效的数据增强技术。

Conclusion: 需要开发专用的单细胞多模态数据整合框架，scSSL-Bench为自监督学习在单细胞分析中的应用提供了标准化评估平台和具体建议。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has proven to be a powerful approach for
extracting biologically meaningful representations from single-cell data. To
advance our understanding of SSL methods applied to single-cell data, we
present scSSL-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates nineteen SSL
methods. Our evaluation spans nine datasets and focuses on three common
downstream tasks: batch correction, cell type annotation, and missing modality
prediction. Furthermore, we systematically assess various data augmentation
strategies. Our analysis reveals task-specific trade-offs: the specialized
single-cell frameworks, scVI, CLAIRE, and the finetuned scGPT excel at
uni-modal batch correction, while generic SSL methods, such as VICReg and
SimCLR, demonstrate superior performance in cell typing and multi-modal data
integration. Random masking emerges as the most effective augmentation
technique across all tasks, surpassing domain-specific augmentations. Notably,
our results indicate the need for a specialized single-cell multi-modal data
integration framework. scSSL-Bench provides a standardized evaluation platform
and concrete recommendations for applying SSL to single-cell analysis,
advancing the convergence of deep learning and single-cell genomics.

Result: 模型性能与序列似然性高度相关，且序列长度对预测范围有显著影响。

Conclusion: 使用gLMs预测突变效应时，需综合考虑序列似然性和长度。

Abstract: Genomic language models (gLMs) show potential for generating novel,
functional DNA sequences for synthetic biology, but doing so requires them to
learn not just evolutionary plausibility, but also sequence-to-function
relationships. We introduce a set of prediction tasks called Nullsettes, which
assesses a model's ability to predict loss-of-function mutations created by
translocating key control elements in synthetic expression cassettes. Across 12
state-of-the-art models, we find that mutation effect prediction performance
strongly correlates with the predicted likelihood of the nonmutant.
Furthermore, the range of likelihood values predictive of strong model
performance is highly dependent on sequence length. Our work highlights the
importance of considering both sequence likelihood and sequence length when
using gLMs for mutation effect prediction.

Conclusion: 该算法能有效识别同质子集，为疾病研究和治疗提供支持。

Abstract: We design an efficient algorithm that outputs a linear classifier for
identifying homogeneous subsets (equivalently subcohorts) from large
inhomogeneous datasets. Our theoretical contribution is a rounding technique,
similar to that of Goemans and Williamson (1994), that approximates the optimal
solution of the underlying optimization problem within a factor of $0.82$. As
an application, we use our algorithm to design a simple test that can identify
homogeneous subcohorts of patients, that are mainly comprised of metastatic
cases, from the RNA microarray dataset for breast cancer by Curtis et al.
(2012). Furthermore, we also use the test output by the algorithm to
systematically identify subcohorts of patients in which statistically
significant changes in methylation levels of tumor suppressor genes co-occur
with statistically significant changes in nuclear receptor expression.
Identifying such homogeneous subcohorts of patients can be useful for the
discovery of disease pathways and therapeutics, specific to the subcohort.

facilities. We propose instead computing approximation ratios of the
complemented Gini index of utilities, and consider how well both deterministic
and randomized mechanisms approximate this. In addition, as Nash welfare is
often put forwards as an equitable compromise between egalitarian and
utilitarian outcomes, we consider how well mechanisms approximate the Nash
welfare.

Motivation: 线性流控制策略在强扰动序列中可能失效，因此需要开发更有效的策略。

Result: 学习到的策略优于比例控制，且能泛化到任意长扰动序列；四分之一弦长俯仰控制效果更优。

Conclusion: 提出的框架具有通用性，结合加速技术可解决更复杂的流控制问题。

Abstract: A linear flow control strategy designed for weak disturbances may not remain
effective in sequences of strong disturbances due to nonlinear interactions,
but it is sensible to leverage it for developing a better strategy. In the
present study, we propose a transformer-based reinforcement learning (RL)
framework to learn an effective control strategy for regulating aerodynamic
lift in gust sequences via pitch control. The transformer addresses the
challenge of partial observability from limited surface pressure sensors. We
demonstrate that the training can be accelerated with two techniques --
pretraining with an expert policy (here, linear control) and task-level
transfer learning (here, extending a policy trained on isolated gusts to
multiple gusts). We show that the learned strategy outperforms the best
proportional control, with the performance gap widening as the number of gusts
increases. The control strategy learned in an environment with a small number
of successive gusts is shown to effectively generalize to an environment with
an arbitrarily long sequence of gusts. We investigate the pivot configuration
and show that quarter-chord pitching control can achieve superior lift
regulation with substantially less control effort compared to mid-chord
pitching control. Through a decomposition of the lift, we attribute this
advantage to the dominant added-mass contribution accessible via quarter-chord
pitching. The success on multiple configurations shows the generalizability of
the proposed transformer-based RL framework, which offers a promising approach
to solve more computationally demanding flow control problems when combined

*Rui Zhang,Qi Meng,Han Wan,Yang Liu,Zhi-Ming Ma,Hao Sun*

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: OmniFluids提出了一种统一的物理预训练算子学习框架，结合物理预训练、粗网格算子蒸馏和少样本微调，显著提升了流体动力学模拟的效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统计算流体动力学方法计算成本高，而现有深度学习方法（如PINNs和神经算子）需要大量数据或调参。OmniFluids旨在解决这些限制，实现高效且通用的流体模拟。

Method: OmniFluids框架包括物理预训练、粗网格算子蒸馏和少样本微调，结合混合算子、多帧解码器和因子化傅里叶层等关键组件。

Result: 在多种二维和三维基准测试中，OmniFluids在流场重建和湍流统计精度上优于现有AI方法，速度比传统求解器快10-100倍，并能从稀疏噪声数据中恢复未知物理参数。

Conclusion: OmniFluids为有限数据下的复杂流体系统提供了一种高效且通用的替代建模新范式。

Abstract: High-fidelity and efficient simulation of fluid dynamics drive progress in
various scientific and engineering applications. Traditional computational
fluid dynamics methods offer strong interpretability and guaranteed
convergence, but rely on fine spatial and temporal meshes, incurring
prohibitive computational costs. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and
neural operators aim to accelerate PDE solvers using deep learning techniques.
However, PINNs require extensive retraining and careful tuning, and purely
data-driven operators demand large labeled datasets. Hybrid physics-aware
methods embed numerical discretizations into network architectures or loss
functions, but achieve marginal speed gains and become unstable when balancing
coarse priors against high-fidelity measurements. To this end, we introduce
OmniFluids, a unified physics pre-trained operator learning framework that
integrates physics-only pre-training, coarse-grid operator distillation, and
few-shot fine-tuning, which enables fast inference and accurate prediction
under limited or zero data supervision. For architectural design, the key
components of OmniFluids include a mixture of operators, a multi-frame decoder,
and factorized Fourier layers, which enable efficient and scalable modeling of
diverse physical tasks while maintaining seamless integration with
physics-based supervision. Across a broad range of two- and three-dimensional
benchmarks, OmniFluids significantly outperforms state-of-the-art AI-driven
methods in flow field reconstruction and turbulence statistics accuracy,
delivering 10-100x speedups compared to classical solvers, and accurately
recovers unknown physical parameters from sparse, noisy data. This work
establishes a new paradigm for efficient and generalizable surrogate modeling
in complex fluid systems under limited data availability.

### [375] [Collective Bargaining in the Information Economy Can Address AI-Driven Power Concentration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10272)
*Nicholas Vincent,Matthew Prewitt,Hanlin Li*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 论文主张通过集体谈判重构AI信息市场，以避免信息市场失灵和资本集中，并提出技术和政策干预措施。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI系统依赖的信息市场存在不公平现象，信息生产者（如记者、研究人员）缺乏议价能力，可能导致资本集中和信息生态崩溃。

Method: 提出通过集体谈判、技术工具（如联邦数据管理）和政策干预（如支持数据中介组织）来协调市场。

Result: 集体谈判和协调可创造市场摩擦和对齐激励，促进可持续的AI发展。

Conclusion: 通过集体谈判和政策支持，可以实现信息经济的可持续发展，避免市场失灵和生态崩溃。

Abstract: This position paper argues that there is an urgent need to restructure
markets for the information that goes into AI systems. Specifically, producers
of information goods (such as journalists, researchers, and creative
professionals) need to be able to collectively bargain with AI product builders
in order to receive reasonable terms and a sustainable return on the
informational value they contribute. We argue that without increased market
coordination or collective bargaining on the side of these primary information
producers, AI will exacerbate a large-scale "information market failure" that
will lead not only to undesirable concentration of capital, but also to a
potential "ecological collapse" in the informational commons. On the other
hand, collective bargaining in the information economy can create market
frictions and aligned incentives necessary for a pro-social, sustainable AI
future. We provide concrete actions that can be taken to support a
coalition-based approach to achieve this goal. For example, researchers and
developers can establish technical mechanisms such as federated data management
tools and explainable data value estimations, to inform and facilitate
collective bargaining in the information economy. Additionally, regulatory and
policy interventions may be introduced to support trusted data intermediary
organizations representing guilds or syndicates of information producers.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了城市数字孪生中模型整合的复杂性，提出了一种开放的Urban Model Platform，支持去中心化模型集成和多模型方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市数字孪生需要整合大量数字资源以实现可持续和综合的城市规划，但现有方法多为集中式，限制了模型的多样性和开放性。

Method: 采用参与式设计方法，与德国汉堡市合作，开发了一个开放的Urban Model Platform，支持开放标准和多模型集成。

Result: 该平台既能作为城市数字孪生的技术基础，又能作为社会技术框架，支持协作和多元化的城市过程表示。

Conclusion: 开放的Urban Model Platform为解决城市数字孪生中的复杂性和多样性问题提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Urban digital twins are increasingly perceived as a way to pool the growing
digital resources of cities for the purpose of a more sustainable and
integrated urban planning. Models and simulations are central to this
undertaking: They enable "what if?" scenarios, create insights and describe
relationships between the vast data that is being collected. However, the
process of integrating and subsequently using models in urban digital twins is
an inherently complex undertaking. It raises questions about how to represent
urban complexity, how to deal with uncertain assUrban Model Platformtions and
modeling paradigms, and how to capture underlying power relations. Existent
approaches in the domain largely focus on monolithic and centralized solutions
in the tradition of neoliberal city-making, oftentimes prohibiting pluralistic
and open interoperable models. Using a participatory design for participatory
systems approach together with the City of Hamburg, Germany, we find that an
open Urban Model Platform can function both as a public technological backbone
for modeling and simulation in urban digital twins and as a socio-technical
framework for a collaborative and pluralistic representation of urban
processes. Such a platform builds on open standards, allows for a decentralized
integration of models, enables communication between models and supports a
multi-model approach to representing urban systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 新法西斯主义在西方社会迅速增长，威胁民主和少数群体，需采取行动遏制其蔓延。

Method: 开发新法西斯主义编码方案，收集论坛数据（如Iron March和Stormfront.org），通过众包标注千条帖子，训练并测试SLMs和LLMs分类模型。

Result: 发现论坛中新法西斯言论普遍存在，成功训练出首个新法西斯话语分类模型。

Conclusion: 社会背景是新法西斯言论研究的关键，需持续对抗此类政治运动以维护民主社会。

Abstract: Neo-fascism is a political and societal ideology that has been having
remarkable growth in the last decade in the United States of America (USA), as
well as in other Western societies. It poses a grave danger to democracy and
the minorities it targets, and it requires active actions against it to avoid
escalation. This work presents the first-of-its-kind neo-fascist coding scheme
for digital discourse in the USA societal context, overseen by political
science researchers. Our work bridges the gap between Natural Language
Processing (NLP) and political science against this phenomena. Furthermore, to
test the coding scheme, we collect a tremendous amount of activity on the
internet from notable neo-fascist groups (the forums of Iron March and
Stormfront.org), and the guidelines are applied to a subset of the collected
posts. Through crowdsourcing, we annotate a total of a thousand posts that are
labeled as neo-fascist or non-neo-fascist. With this labeled data set, we
fine-tune and test both Small Language Models (SLMs) and Large Language Models
(LLMs), obtaining the very first classification models for neo-fascist
discourse. We find that the prevalence of neo-fascist rhetoric in this kind of
forum is ever-present, making them a good target for future research. The
societal context is a key consideration for neo-fascist speech when conducting
NLP research. Finally, the work against this kind of political movement must be
pressed upon and continued for the well-being of a democratic society.
Disclaimer: This study focuses on detecting neo-fascist content in text,
similar to other hate speech analyses, without labeling individuals or
organizations.

Conclusion: LLMs在个性化学习回答生成中具有潜力，示例的引入能有效提升其表现，为在线学习提供了新的支持工具。

Abstract: Online learning has experienced rapid growth due to its flexibility and
accessibility. Personalization, adapted to the needs of individual learners, is
crucial for enhancing the learning experience, particularly in online settings.
A key aspect of personalization is providing learners with answers customized
to their specific questions. This paper therefore explores the potential of
Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate personalized answers to learners'
questions, thereby enhancing engagement and reducing the workload on educators.
To evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in this context, we conducted a
comprehensive study using the StackExchange platform in two distinct areas:
language learning and programming. We developed a framework and a dataset for
validating automatically generated personalized answers. Subsequently, we
generated personalized answers using different strategies, including 0-shot,
1-shot, and few-shot scenarios. The generated answers were evaluated using
three methods: 1. BERTScore, 2. LLM evaluation, and 3. human evaluation. Our
findings indicated that providing LLMs with examples of desired answers (from
the learner or similar learners) can significantly enhance the LLMs' ability to
tailor responses to individual learners' needs.

*Ziv Scully,Alexander Terenin*

TL;DR: 本文探讨了Gittins指数在实际问题中的应用，尽管其理论性强且适用范围有限，但通过示例展示了其解决实际问题的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gittins指数虽在理论上重要，但被认为缺乏实际应用价值。本文旨在证明其在实际问题中的实用性。

Method: 通过示例驱动的介绍，展示Gittins指数在多种问题中的应用，包括最优和次优解。

Result: Gittins指数在贝叶斯优化和队列尾延迟最小化等实际问题中表现优异。

Conclusion: Gittins指数不仅具有理论意义，还能有效解决实际问题。

Abstract: The Gittins index is a tool that optimally solves a variety of
decision-making problems involving uncertainty, including multi-armed bandit
problems, minimizing mean latency in queues, and search problems like the
Pandora's box model. However, despite the above examples and later extensions
thereof, the space of problems that the Gittins index can solve perfectly
optimally is limited, and its definition is rather subtle compared to those of
other multi-armed bandit algorithms. As a result, the Gittins index is often
regarded as being primarily a concept of theoretical importance, rather than a
practical tool for solving decision-making problems.
  The aim of this tutorial is to demonstrate that the Gittins index can be
fruitfully applied to practical problems. We start by giving an example-driven
introduction to the Gittins index, then walk through several examples of
problems it solves - some optimally, some suboptimally but still with excellent
performance. Two practical highlights in the latter category are applying the
Gittins index to Bayesian optimization, and applying the Gittins index to
minimizing tail latency in queues.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种将Levy的CBPV lambda演算编码到pi演算的方法，并证明了其正确性和完备性。编码针对内部pi演算（pi-i-calculus）进行了优化，解决了de Bruijn索引的挑战，并满足Gorla提出的五项编码标准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于解决CBPV lambda演算在pi演算中的编码问题，同时优化形式化过程中的技术挑战，如de Bruijn索引和双模拟的一致性。

Method: 方法包括手工证明编码的正确性和完备性，并针对pi-i-calculus进行优化。此外，还比较了Milner的编码方法。

Result: 结果表明编码在pi-i-calculus中具有正确性和完备性，且满足Gorla的标准。部分证明已在Coq中形式化。

Conclusion: 结论是提出的编码方法有效且合理，但部分引理仍需进一步形式化验证。

Abstract: In this report we define an encoding of Levys call-by-push-value
lambda-calculus (CBPV) in the pi-calculus, and prove that our encoding is both
sound and complete. We present informal (by-hand) proofs of soundness,
completeness, and all required lemmas. The encoding is specialized to the
internal pi-calculus (pi-i-calculus) to circumvent certain challenges
associated with using de Bruijn index in a formalization, and it also helps
with bisimulation as early-, late- and open-bisimulation coincide in this
setting, furthermore bisimulation is a congruence. Additionally, we argue that
our encoding also satisfies the five criteria for good encodings proposed by
Gorla, as well as show similarities between Milners and our encoding. This
paper includes encodings from CBPV in the pi-i-calculus, asynchronous polyadic
pi-calculus and the local pi-calculus. We begin a formalization of the proof in
Coq for the soundness and completeness of the encoding in the pi-i-calculus.
Not all lemmas used in the formalization are themselves formally proven.
However, we argue that the non-proven lemmas are reasonable, as they are proven
by hand, or amount to Coq formalities that are straightforward given informal
arguments.

TL;DR: StepProof提出了一种新的自动形式化方法，支持句子级别的验证，显著提高了证明成功率和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 交互式定理证明器（ITP）缺乏自然语言接口，现有自动形式化方法仅能验证完整证明，无法进行句子级验证。

Method: StepProof将完整证明分解为多个可验证的子证明，实现句子级验证，并支持对自然语言证明的微调。

Result: 实验表明，StepProof在证明成功率和效率上优于传统方法，且手动微调能进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: StepProof填补了自动形式化在句子级验证上的空白，为ITP的自然语言接口提供了新思路。

Abstract: Interactive theorem provers (ITPs) are powerful tools for the formal
verification of mathematical proofs down to the axiom level. However, their
lack of a natural language interface remains a significant limitation. Recent
advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enhanced the understanding of
natural language inputs, paving the way for autoformalization - the process of
translating natural language proofs into formal proofs that can be verified.
Despite these advancements, existing autoformalization approaches are limited
to verifying complete proofs and lack the capability for finer, sentence-level
verification. To address this gap, we propose StepProof, a novel
autoformalization method designed for granular, step-by-step verification.
StepProof breaks down complete proofs into multiple verifiable subproofs,
enabling sentence-level verification. Experimental results demonstrate that
StepProof significantly improves proof success rates and efficiency compared to
traditional methods. Additionally, we found that minor manual adjustments to
the natural language proofs, tailoring them for step-level verification,
further enhanced StepProof's performance in autoformalization.

Result: 证明了算法的样本复杂度上界和理论下界，并在特定条件下与无噪声情况一致。

Conclusion: 解决了开放性问题，表明在高信噪比下，噪声情况与无噪声情况的复杂度一致。

Abstract: In this paper, we establish sample complexity bounds for learning
high-dimensional simplices in $\mathbb{R}^K$ from noisy data. Specifically, we
consider $n$ i.i.d. samples uniformly drawn from an unknown simplex in
$\mathbb{R}^K$, each corrupted by additive Gaussian noise of unknown variance.
We prove an algorithm exists that, with high probability, outputs a simplex
within $\ell_2$ or total variation (TV) distance at most $\varepsilon$ from the
true simplex, provided $n \ge (K^2/\varepsilon^2)
e^{\mathcal{O}(K/\mathrm{SNR}^2)}$, where $\mathrm{SNR}$ is the signal-to-noise
ratio. Extending our prior work~\citep{saberi2023sample}, we derive new
information-theoretic lower bounds, showing that simplex estimation within TV
distance $\varepsilon$ requires at least $n \ge \Omega(K^3
\sigma^2/\varepsilon^2 + K/\varepsilon)$ samples, where $\sigma^2$ denotes the
noise variance. In the noiseless scenario, our lower bound $n \ge
\Omega(K/\varepsilon)$ matches known upper bounds up to constant factors. We
resolve an open question by demonstrating that when $\mathrm{SNR} \ge
\Omega(K^{1/2})$, noisy-case complexity aligns with the noiseless case. Our
analysis leverages sample compression techniques (Ashtiani et al., 2018) and
introduces a novel Fourier-based method for recovering distributions from noisy
observations, potentially applicable beyond simplex learning.

Conclusion: 3MSBM为多边际设置中的匹配框架训练开辟了新途径，具有更好的收敛性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Understanding complex systems by inferring trajectories from sparse sample
snapshots is a fundamental challenge in a wide range of domains, e.g.,
single-cell biology, meteorology, and economics. Despite advancements in Bridge
and Flow matching frameworks, current methodologies rely on pairwise
interpolation between adjacent snapshots. This hinders their ability to capture
long-range temporal dependencies and potentially affects the coherence of the
inferred trajectories. To address these issues, we introduce \textbf{Momentum
Multi-Marginal Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching (3MSBM)}, a novel matching
framework that learns smooth measure-valued splines for stochastic systems that
satisfy multiple positional constraints. This is achieved by lifting the
dynamics to phase space and generalizing stochastic bridges to be conditioned
on several points, forming a multi-marginal conditional stochastic optimal
control problem. The underlying dynamics are then learned by minimizing a
variational objective, having fixed the path induced by the multi-marginal
conditional bridge. As a matching approach, 3MSBM learns transport maps that
preserve intermediate marginals throughout training, significantly improving
convergence and scalability. Extensive experimentation in a series of
real-world applications validates the superior performance of 3MSBM compared to
existing methods in capturing complex dynamics with temporal dependencies,
opening new avenues for training matching frameworks in multi-marginal
settings.

Conclusion: 该框架为理解在线学习中的连续谱提供了灵活工具，并展示了无先验知识学习的可能性。

Abstract: There has been much recent interest in understanding the continuum from
adversarial to stochastic settings in online learning, with various frameworks
including smoothed settings proposed to bridge this gap. We consider the more
general and flexible framework of distributionally constrained adversaries in
which instances are drawn from distributions chosen by an adversary within some
constrained distribution class [RST11]. Compared to smoothed analysis, we
consider general distributional classes which allows for a fine-grained
understanding of learning settings between fully stochastic and fully
adversarial for which a learner can achieve non-trivial regret. We give a
characterization for which distribution classes are learnable in this context
against both oblivious and adaptive adversaries, providing insights into the
types of interplay between the function class and distributional constraints on
adversaries that enable learnability. In particular, our results recover and
generalize learnability for known smoothed settings. Further, we show that for
several natural function classes including linear classifiers, learning can be
achieved without any prior knowledge of the distribution class -- in other
words, a learner can simultaneously compete against any constrained adversary
within learnable distribution classes.

Conclusion: 不同类别的语义决策发生在不同中间时间点，揭示了扩散生成过程中语义信息的动态特性。

Abstract: It is well known that semantic and structural features of the generated
images emerge at different times during the reverse dynamics of diffusion, a
phenomenon that has been connected to physical phase transitions in magnets and
other materials. In this paper, we introduce a general information-theoretic
approach to measure when these class-semantic "decisions" are made during the
generative process. By using an online formula for the optimal Bayesian
classifier, we estimate the conditional entropy of the class label given the
noisy state. We then determine the time intervals corresponding to the highest
information transfer between noisy states and class labels using the time
derivative of the conditional entropy. We demonstrate our method on
one-dimensional Gaussian mixture models and on DDPM models trained on the
CIFAR10 dataset. As expected, we find that the semantic information transfer is
highest in the intermediate stages of diffusion while vanishing during the
final stages. However, we found sizable differences between the entropy rate
profiles of different classes, suggesting that different "semantic decisions"
are located at different intermediate times.

Motivation: 传统Softmax函数通过温度参数提供软控制，但无法强制施加硬性约束（如上下界），这在需要可靠和可信模型的场景中至关重要。

Method: 提出了BCSoftmax函数，作为解决带约束优化问题的方法，并开发了高效计算算法。还引入了两种基于BCSoftmax的后校准方法，通过学习输出概率或logits的上下界来校准模型。

Result: 在TinyImageNet、CIFAR-100和20NewsGroups数据集上实验验证了方法的有效性，校准指标有所提升。

Conclusion: BCSoftmax及其校准方法能够有效提升模型的可靠性，适用于需要可信预测的下游任务。

Abstract: Controlling the output probabilities of softmax-based models is a common
problem in modern machine learning. Although the $\mathrm{Softmax}$ function
provides soft control via its temperature parameter, it lacks the ability to
enforce hard constraints, such as box constraints, on output probabilities,
which can be critical in certain applications requiring reliable and
trustworthy models. In this work, we propose the box-constrained softmax
($\mathrm{BCSoftmax}$) function, a novel generalization of the
$\mathrm{Softmax}$ function that explicitly enforces lower and upper bounds on
output probabilities. While $\mathrm{BCSoftmax}$ is formulated as the solution
to a box-constrained optimization problem, we develop an exact and efficient
computation algorithm for $\mathrm{BCSoftmax}$. As a key application, we
introduce two post-hoc calibration methods based on $\mathrm{BCSoftmax}$. The
proposed methods mitigate underconfidence and overconfidence in predictive
models by learning the lower and upper bounds of the output probabilities or
logits after model training, thereby enhancing reliability in downstream
decision-making tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods
experimentally using the TinyImageNet, CIFAR-100, and 20NewsGroups datasets,
achieving improvements in calibration metrics.

Result: 在静态场景中与现有方法相当，但在允许中间策略部署时显著优于离线方法。

Conclusion: 自适应数据收集和PAC-Bayesian框架的结合在实验中表现出显著优势。

Abstract: Off-policy learning serves as the primary framework for learning optimal
policies from logged interactions collected under a static behavior policy. In
this work, we investigate the more practical and flexible setting of adaptive
off-policy learning, where policies are iteratively refined and re-deployed to
collect higher-quality data. Building on the success of PAC-Bayesian learning
with Logarithmic Smoothing (LS) in static settings, we extend this framework to
the adaptive scenario using tools from online PAC-Bayesian theory. Furthermore,
we demonstrate that a principled adjustment to the LS estimator naturally
accommodates multiple rounds of deployment and yields faster convergence rates
under mild conditions. Our method matches the performance of leading offline
approaches in static settings, and significantly outperforms them when
intermediate policy deployments are allowed. Empirical evaluations across
diverse scenarios highlight both the advantages of adaptive data collection and
the strength of the PAC-Bayesian formulation.

Result: 新估计器简单且能显著降低方差，理论和实验结果均验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为A/B测试提供了一种更高效的估计工具，尤其适用于相似系统的比较。

Abstract: We address the problem of A/B testing, a widely used protocol for evaluating
the potential improvement achieved by a new decision system compared to a
baseline. This protocol segments the population into two subgroups, each
exposed to a version of the system and estimates the improvement as the
difference between the measured effects. In this work, we demonstrate that the
commonly used difference-in-means estimator, while unbiased, can be improved.
We introduce a family of unbiased off-policy estimators that achieves lower
variance than the standard approach. Among this family, we identify the
estimator with the lowest variance. The resulting estimator is simple, and
offers substantial variance reduction when the two tested systems exhibit
similarities. Our theoretical analysis and experimental results validate the
effectiveness and practicality of the proposed method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在隐藏混杂因素存在时因果效应估计的挑战，利用非参数工具变量回归方法。

Method: 采用基于谱特征的两阶段最小二乘估计器，并推导其泛化误差界。

Result: 性能取决于两个关键因素：谱对齐强度和特征值衰减速度，分为好、坏、丑三种情景。

Conclusion: 谱对齐和特征值衰减速度决定了方法的有效性，实验验证了分类的合理性。

Abstract: We address the problem of causal effect estimation in the presence of hidden
confounders, using nonparametric instrumental variable (IV) regression. A
leading strategy employs spectral features - that is, learned features spanning
the top eigensubspaces of the operator linking treatments to instruments. We
derive a generalization error bound for a two-stage least squares estimator
based on spectral features, and gain insights into the method's performance and
failure modes. We show that performance depends on two key factors, leading to
a clear taxonomy of outcomes. In a good scenario, the approach is optimal. This
occurs with strong spectral alignment, meaning the structural function is
well-represented by the top eigenfunctions of the conditional operator, coupled
with this operator's slow eigenvalue decay, indicating a strong instrument.
Performance degrades in a bad scenario: spectral alignment remains strong, but
rapid eigenvalue decay (indicating a weaker instrument) demands significantly
more samples for effective feature learning. Finally, in the ugly scenario,
weak spectral alignment causes the method to fail, regardless of the
eigenvalues' characteristics. Our synthetic experiments empirically validate
this taxonomy.

Abstract: Obtaining high-quality labeled datasets is often costly, requiring either
extensive human annotation or expensive experiments. We propose a method that
supplements such "expert" labels with AI predictions from pre-trained models to

probably approximately correct labels: with high probability, the overall
labeling error is small. This solution enables rigorous yet efficient dataset
curation using modern AI models. We demonstrate the benefits of the methodology
through text annotation with large language models, image labeling with
pre-trained vision models, and protein folding analysis with AlphaFold.

Motivation: 探索分类器自由引导在离散扩散模型中的作用，特别是其对采样行为和输出分布的影响。

Method: 假设无分数误差和离散化误差，推导了引导反向动力学的显式解，并通过实验验证理论分析。

Result: 引导会放大特定类别的区域，抑制共享区域，且在不同维度（1D和2D）中表现出不同的行为。大引导强度下，总变差的衰减率呈双指数增长。

Conclusion: 引导不仅影响输出分布，还控制采样轨迹的动态行为，理论分析得到了实验支持。

Abstract: We study masked discrete diffusion models with classifier-free guidance
(CFG). Assuming no score error nor discretization error, we derive an explicit
solution to the guided reverse dynamics, so that how guidance influences the
sampling behavior can be precisely characterized. When the full data
distribution is a mixture over classes and the goal is to sample from a
specific class, guidance amplifies class-specific regions while suppresses
regions shared with other classes. This effect depends on the guidance strength
$w$ and induces distinct covariance structures in the sampled distribution.
Notably, we observe quantitatively different behaviors in $1$D and $2$D. We
also show that for large $w$, the decay rate of the total variation
($\mathrm{TV}$) along the reverse dynamics is double-exponential in $w$ for
both $1$D and $2$D. These findings highlight the role of guidance, not just in
shaping the output distribution, but also in controlling the dynamics of the
sampling trajectory. Our theoretical analysis is supported by experiments that
illustrate the geometric effects of guidance and its impact on convergence.

Result: 模拟结果显示，该算法在有限能量下显著提高了观测精度，且无需过滤高频信息。

Conclusion: 该算法为眼到手配置提供了一种高效且节能的相机位置优化方案。

Abstract: Visual servoing technology has been well developed and applied in many
automated manufacturing tasks, especially in tools' pose alignment. To access a
full global view of tools, most applications adopt eye-to-hand configuration or
eye-to-hand/eye-in-hand cooperation configuration in an automated manufacturing
environment. Most research papers mainly put efforts into developing control
and observation architectures in various scenarios, but few of them have
discussed the importance of the camera's location in eye-to-hand configuration.
In a manufacturing environment, the quality of camera estimations may vary
significantly from one observation location to another, as the combined effects
of environmental conditions result in different noise levels of a single image
shot at different locations. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for the
camera's moving policy so that it explores the camera workspace and searches
for the optimal location where the images' noise level is minimized. Also, this
algorithm ensures the camera ends up at a suboptimal (if the optimal one is
unreachable) location among the locations already searched, with limited energy
available for moving the camera. Unlike a simple brute force approach, the
algorithm enables the camera to explore space more efficiently by adapting the
search policy from learning the environment. With the aid of an image averaging
technique, this algorithm, in use of a solo camera, achieves the observation
accuracy in eye-to-hand configurations to a desirable extent without filtering
out high-frequency information in the original image. An automated
manufacturing application has been simulated and the results show the success
of this algorithm's improvement of observation precision with limited energy.

Motivation: 传统扩散模型在反问题中需要完整的反向扩散过程，且对噪声中间状态敏感，导致在非线性求解器（如FWI）中不稳定。

Method: 提出了一种框架，将预训练的DDPM作为基于分数的生成扩散先验，通过分数重匹配策略直接集成到FWI中，避免了反向扩散采样。

Result: 数值实验表明，该方法比传统和基于GAN的FWI方法具有更高的保真度和鲁棒性，且计算高效。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持计算效率的同时，显著提升了FWI的反演质量和稳定性，适用于地震成像等反问题。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently shown promise as powerful generative priors
for inverse problems. However, conventional applications require solving the
full reverse diffusion process and operating on noisy intermediate states,
which poses challenges for physics-constrained computational seismic imaging.
In particular, such instability is pronounced in non-linear solvers like those
used in Full Waveform Inversion (FWI), where wave propagation through noisy
velocity fields can lead to numerical artifacts and poor inversion quality. In
this work, we propose a simple yet effective framework that directly integrates
a pretrained Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) as a score-based
generative diffusion prior into FWI through a score rematching strategy. Unlike
traditional diffusion approaches, our method avoids the reverse diffusion
sampling and needs fewer iterations. We operate the image inversion entirely in
the clean image space, eliminating the need to operate through noisy velocity
models. The generative diffusion prior can be introduced as a simple
regularization term in the standard FWI update rule, requiring minimal
modification to existing FWI pipelines. This promotes stable wave propagation
and can improve convergence behavior and inversion quality. Numerical
experiments suggest that the proposed method offers enhanced fidelity and
robustness compared to conventional and GAN-based FWI approaches, while
remaining practical and computationally efficient for seismic imaging and other
inverse problem tasks.

Motivation: 旨在利用雷达数据和电离层无线电波传播模型，自动构建分类器以分析电离层散射数据。

Method: 基于12个SuperDARN和SECIRA雷达网络两年数据，结合无线电波传播模型和数学质量评估标准，训练包含2669个系数的分类模型。

Result: 确定了37个数据类别（25个常见），其中14个类别可明确区分，并对10个类别进行了初步解释。分类结果与已知物理机制一致。

Conclusion: 分类器有效，关键参数包括信号轨迹形状、散射高度和多普勒速度，为电离层研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: The paper presents a method for automatic constructing a classifier for
processed data obtained by decameter coherent scatter radars. Method is based
only on the radar data obtained, the results of automatic modeling of radio
wave propagation in the ionosphere, and mathematical criteria for estimating
the quality of the models. The final classifier is the model trained at data
obtained by 12 radars of the SuperDARN and SECIRA networks over two years for
each radar. The number of the model coefficients is 2669. For the
classification, the model uses both the calculated parameters of radio wave
propagation in the model ionosphere and the parameters directly measured by the
radar. Calibration of radiowave elevation measurements at each radar was made
using meteor trail scattered signals. The analysis showed that the optimal
number of classes in the data is 37, of which 25 are frequently observed. The
analysis made it possible to choose 14 classes from them, which are confidently
separated in other variants of model training. A preliminary interpretation of
10 of them was carried out. The dynamics of observation of various classes and
their dependence on the geographical latitude of radars at different levels of
solar and geomagnetic activity were presented, it was shown that it does not
contradict with known physical mechanisms. The analysis showed that the most
important parameters to identify the classes are the shape of the signal
ray-tracing trajectory in its second half, the ray-traced scattering height and
the Doppler velocity measured by the radar.

Motivation: 便携式鞋垫传感器在GRF测量中成本低且便携，但精度不足，需要一种方法提升其准确性。

Method: 采用时间感知知识蒸馏框架，利用小批量数据中的相似性和时序特征，捕捉目标与输入数据的互补关系和序列特性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在GRF估计中优于现有基线，准确性接近跑步机测量。

Conclusion: 时间感知知识蒸馏框架有效提升了便携式传感器在GRF估计中的精度，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Human gait analysis with wearable sensors has been widely used in various
applications, such as daily life healthcare, rehabilitation, physical therapy,
and clinical diagnostics and monitoring. In particular, ground reaction force
(GRF) provides critical information about how the body interacts with the
ground during locomotion. Although instrumented treadmills have been widely
used as the gold standard for measuring GRF during walking, their lack of
portability and high cost make them impractical for many applications. As an
alternative, low-cost, portable, wearable insole sensors have been utilized to
measure GRF; however, these sensors are susceptible to noise and disturbance
and are less accurate than treadmill measurements. To address these challenges,
we propose a Time-aware Knowledge Distillation framework for GRF estimation
from insole sensor data. This framework leverages similarity and temporal
features within a mini-batch during the knowledge distillation process,
effectively capturing the complementary relationships between features and the
sequential properties of the target and input data. The performance of the
lightweight models distilled through this framework was evaluated by comparing
GRF estimations from insole sensor data against measurements from an
instrumented treadmill. Empirical results demonstrated that Time-aware
Knowledge Distillation outperforms current baselines in GRF estimation from
wearable sensor data.

Conclusion: 提出了干预措施，帮助中小型企业克服网络安全挑战。

Abstract: Key decision-makers in small and medium businesses (SMBs) often lack the
awareness and knowledge to implement cybersecurity measures effectively. To
gain a deeper understanding of how SMB executives navigate cybersecurity
decision-making, we deployed a mixed-method approach, conducting
semi-structured interviews (n=21) and online surveys (n=322) with SMB key
decision-makers. Using thematic analysis, we revealed SMB decision-makers'
perceived risks in terms of the digital assets they valued, and found reasons
for their choice of defense measures and factors impacting security perception.
We employed the situational awareness model to characterize decision-makers
based on cybersecurity awareness, identifying those who have comparatively low
awareness in the fight against adversaries. We further explored the
relationship between awareness and business attributes, and constructed a
holistic structural equation model to understand how awareness can be improved.
Finally, we proposed interventions to help SMBs overcome potential challenges.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对齐大型语言模型（LLM）通常需要大量人工标注的偏好数据，成本高且耗时。现有合成数据方法依赖复杂迭代提示或辅助模型，亟需更简单高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出Refusal-Aware Adaptive Injection (RAAI)框架，通过检测LLM的拒绝信号并自适应注入预定义短语，生成有害但流畅的补全内容。

Result: RAAI将有害响应率从基线2.15%提升至平均61.04%。利用生成数据微调LLM可增强模型对有害提示的鲁棒性，同时保持标准任务性能。

Conclusion: RAAI展示了如何将LLM攻击方法转化为可扩展且可控的安全对齐工具。

Abstract: Safely aligning large language models (LLMs) often demands extensive
human-labeled preference data, a process that's both costly and time-consuming.
While synthetic data offers a promising alternative, current methods frequently
rely on complex iterative prompting or auxiliary models. To address this, we
introduce Refusal-Aware Adaptive Injection (RAAI), a straightforward,
training-free, and model-agnostic framework that repurposes LLM attack
techniques. RAAI works by detecting internal refusal signals and adaptively
injecting predefined phrases to elicit harmful, yet fluent, completions. Our
experiments show RAAI effectively jailbreaks LLMs, increasing the harmful
response rate from a baseline of 2.15% to up to 61.04% on average across four
benchmarks. Crucially, fine-tuning LLMs with the synthetic data generated by
RAAI improves model robustness against harmful prompts while preserving general
capabilities on standard tasks like MMLU and ARC. This work highlights how LLM
attack methodologies can be reframed as practical tools for scalable and
controllable safety alignment.

Motivation: 研究LLMs在代码生成中对越狱攻击的特定脆弱性，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 提出MalwareBench数据集，包含3,520个越狱提示，基于320个手动设计的恶意代码生成需求，覆盖11种越狱方法和29种代码功能类别。

Result: 主流LLMs对恶意代码的平均拒绝率为60.93%，结合越狱攻击算法后降至39.92%。

Conclusion: LLMs的代码安全能力仍面临重大挑战。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has heightened
concerns about their security, particularly their vulnerability to jailbreak
attacks that leverage crafted prompts to generate malicious outputs. While
prior research has been conducted on general security capabilities of LLMs,
their specific susceptibility to jailbreak attacks in code generation remains
largely unexplored. To fill this gap, we propose MalwareBench, a benchmark
dataset containing 3,520 jailbreaking prompts for malicious code-generation,
designed to evaluate LLM robustness against such threats. MalwareBench is based
on 320 manually crafted malicious code generation requirements, covering 11
jailbreak methods and 29 code functionality categories. Experiments show that
mainstream LLMs exhibit limited ability to reject malicious code-generation
requirements, and the combination of multiple jailbreak methods further reduces
the model's security capabilities: specifically, the average rejection rate for
malicious content is 60.93%, dropping to 39.92% when combined with jailbreak
attack algorithms. Our work highlights that the code security capabilities of
LLMs still pose significant challenges.

Method: 提出Private Memorization Editing (PME)，检测并编辑模型记忆的PII。

Result: PME有效减少PII泄露，某些情况下将隐私攻击准确率降至零。

Conclusion: PME是一种有效的隐私防御策略，不影响模型性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) memorize, and thus, among huge amounts of
uncontrolled data, may memorize Personally Identifiable Information (PII),
which should not be stored and, consequently, not leaked. In this paper, we
introduce Private Memorization Editing (PME), an approach for preventing
private data leakage that turns an apparent limitation, that is, the LLMs'
memorization ability, into a powerful privacy defense strategy. While attacks
against LLMs have been performed exploiting previous knowledge regarding their
training data, our approach aims to exploit the same kind of knowledge in order
to make a model more robust. We detect a memorized PII and then mitigate the
memorization of PII by editing a model knowledge of its training data. We
verify that our procedure does not affect the underlying language model while
making it more robust against privacy Training Data Extraction attacks. We
demonstrate that PME can effectively reduce the number of leaked PII in a
number of configurations, in some cases even reducing the accuracy of the
privacy attacks to zero.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着RAG发展为共享知识库的服务平台，保护贡献数据的版权变得至关重要，但现有方法仅关注文本知识，图像知识缺乏保护。

Method: AQUA采用两种互补方法嵌入水印：基于缩写的触发器和空间关系线索，确保水印信号在图像检索到文本生成的间接传播中存活。

Result: 实验表明，AQUA在多模型和数据集上实现了鲁棒、隐蔽且可靠的版权追踪。

Conclusion: AQUA填补了多模态RAG保护的关键空白，为图像知识提供了高效且隐蔽的版权保护方案。

Abstract: As Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) evolves into service-oriented
platforms (Rag-as-a-Service) with shared knowledge bases, protecting the
copyright of contributed data becomes essential. Existing watermarking methods
in RAG focus solely on textual knowledge, leaving image knowledge unprotected.
In this work, we propose AQUA, the first watermark framework for image
knowledge protection in Multimodal RAG systems. AQUA embeds semantic signals
into synthetic images using two complementary methods: acronym-based triggers
and spatial relationship cues. These techniques ensure watermark signals
survive indirect watermark propagation from image retriever to textual
generator, being efficient, effective and imperceptible. Experiments across
diverse models and datasets show that AQUA enables robust, stealthy, and
reliable copyright tracing, filling a key gap in multimodal RAG protection.

Motivation: 大型语言模型代理在敏感数据访问中可能引发隐私泄露风险，需系统性审计方法。

Method: 提出CMPL框架，采用迭代探测策略模拟多轮对话，测试隐私指令的漏洞。

Result: CMPL能发现现有单轮防御无法检测的隐私风险，并提供了量化风险指标和开放基准。

Conclusion: CMPL为对话隐私审计提供了有效工具，支持多领域和多模态数据的隐私风险评估。

Abstract: Large Language Model agents have begun to appear as personal assistants,
customer service bots, and clinical aides. While these applications deliver
substantial operational benefits, they also require continuous access to
sensitive data, which increases the likelihood of unauthorized disclosures.
This study proposes an auditing framework for conversational privacy that
quantifies and audits these risks. The proposed Conversational Manipulation for
Privacy Leakage (CMPL) framework, is an iterative probing strategy designed to
stress-test agents that enforce strict privacy directives. Rather than focusing
solely on a single disclosure event, CMPL simulates realistic multi-turn
interactions to systematically uncover latent vulnerabilities. Our evaluation
on diverse domains, data modalities, and safety configurations demonstrate the
auditing framework's ability to reveal privacy risks that are not deterred by
existing single-turn defenses. In addition to introducing CMPL as a diagnostic
tool, the paper delivers (1) an auditing procedure grounded in quantifiable
risk metrics and (2) an open benchmark for evaluation of conversational privacy
across agent implementations.

TL;DR: GenBreak框架通过微调大型语言模型（LLM）系统探索文本到图像（T2I）模型的漏洞，生成既能绕过安全机制又具有高毒性的对抗性提示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究在评估T2I模型安全性时存在局限性，缺乏可靠工具来发现真正高风险的提示。

Method: 结合监督微调和强化学习，通过多奖励信号指导LLM生成对抗性提示。

Result: 生成的提示在商业T2I模型中表现出强大的黑盒攻击效果，揭示了实际安全隐患。

Conclusion: GenBreak为评估T2I模型安全性提供了有效工具，揭示了其潜在风险。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models such as Stable Diffusion have advanced rapidly and
are now widely used in content creation. However, these models can be misused
to generate harmful content, including nudity or violence, posing significant
safety risks. While most platforms employ content moderation systems,
underlying vulnerabilities can still be exploited by determined adversaries.
Recent research on red-teaming and adversarial attacks against T2I models has
notable limitations: some studies successfully generate highly toxic images but
use adversarial prompts that are easily detected and blocked by safety filters,
while others focus on bypassing safety mechanisms but fail to produce genuinely
harmful outputs, neglecting the discovery of truly high-risk prompts.
Consequently, there remains a lack of reliable tools for evaluating the safety
of defended T2I models. To address this gap, we propose GenBreak, a framework
that fine-tunes a red-team large language model (LLM) to systematically explore
underlying vulnerabilities in T2I generators. Our approach combines supervised
fine-tuning on curated datasets with reinforcement learning via interaction
with a surrogate T2I model. By integrating multiple reward signals, we guide
the LLM to craft adversarial prompts that enhance both evasion capability and
image toxicity, while maintaining semantic coherence and diversity. These
prompts demonstrate strong effectiveness in black-box attacks against
commercial T2I generators, revealing practical and concerning safety
weaknesses.

TL;DR: 研究发现某些机器遗忘方法在简单提示攻击下可能失效，评估了八种遗忘技术，发现部分方法（如ELM）仍易受攻击，挑战了遗忘有效性的普遍假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证机器遗忘方法的实际效果，揭示其在提示攻击下的脆弱性。

Method: 系统评估八种遗忘技术，采用输出、logit和探针分析。

Result: 部分方法（如RMU、TAR）表现稳健，但ELM在特定攻击下恢复57.3%准确率。

Conclusion: 需开发更可靠的评估框架以区分真实知识移除与表面输出抑制。

Abstract: In this work, we show that some machine unlearning methods may fail when
subjected to straightforward prompt attacks. We systematically evaluate eight
unlearning techniques across three model families, and employ output-based,
logit-based, and probe analysis to determine to what extent supposedly
unlearned knowledge can be retrieved. While methods like RMU and TAR
demonstrate robust unlearning, ELM remains vulnerable to specific prompt
attacks (e.g., Hindi filler text in original prompt recovering 57.3% accuracy).
Our logit analysis also confirms that unlearned models are generally not hiding
knowledge by modifying the way the answer is formatted, as the correlation
between output and logit accuracy is strong. These results challenge prevailing
assumptions about unlearning effectiveness and highlight the need for
evaluation frameworks that can reliably distinguish between true knowledge
removal and superficial output suppression. We also publicly make available our
evaluation framework to easily evaluate prompting techniques to retrieve
unlearning knowledge.

Motivation: 微调LLMs常涉及敏感数据，但现有研究未充分评估其隐私风险，尤其是MIAs的威胁。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过实证分析MIAs的机制，提出SOFT技术，利用选择性数据混淆和可调参数来减少隐私泄露。

Result: 实验表明，SOFT在六个领域和多种LLM架构中有效降低隐私风险，同时保持模型性能。

Conclusion: SOFT为微调LLMs提供了一种实用且可扩展的隐私保护解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success and are widely
adopted for diverse applications. However, fine-tuning these models often
involves private or sensitive information, raising critical privacy concerns.
In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive study evaluating the
vulnerability of fine-tuned LLMs to membership inference attacks (MIAs). Our
empirical analysis demonstrates that MIAs exploit the loss reduction during
fine-tuning, making them highly effective in revealing membership information.
These findings motivate the development of our defense. We propose SOFT
(\textbf{S}elective data \textbf{O}bfuscation in LLM
\textbf{F}ine-\textbf{T}uning), a novel defense technique that mitigates
privacy leakage by leveraging influential data selection with an adjustable
parameter to balance utility preservation and privacy protection. Our extensive
experiments span six diverse domains and multiple LLM architectures and scales.
Results show that SOFT effectively reduces privacy risks while maintaining
competitive model performance, offering a practical and scalable solution to
safeguard sensitive information in fine-tuned LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多智能体LLM系统的联合应用潜力，填补现有研究中规范和评估的空白。

Method: 扩展了系统架构和原型，引入多智能体系统规范，并通过网络安全任务进行测试。

Result: 测试表明，基于OpenAI和DeepSeek LLM的智能体能正确完成问答、服务器安全和网络安全任务。

Conclusion: 多智能体LLM系统在特定领域具有潜力，需进一步规范化和系统化评估。

Abstract: Recent advancements in LLMs indicate potential for novel applications, e.g.,
through reasoning capabilities in the latest OpenAI and DeepSeek models. For
applying these models in specific domains beyond text generation, LLM-based
multi-agent approaches can be utilized that solve complex tasks by combining
reasoning techniques, code generation, and software execution. Applications
might utilize these capabilities and the knowledge of specialized LLM agents.
However, while many evaluations are performed on LLMs, reasoning techniques,
and applications individually, their joint specification and combined
application is not explored well. Defined specifications for multi-agent LLM
systems are required to explore their potential and their suitability for
specific applications, allowing for systematic evaluations of LLMs, reasoning
techniques, and related aspects. This paper reports the results of exploratory
research to specify and evaluate these aspects through a multi-agent system.
The system architecture and prototype are extended from previous research and a
specification is introduced for multi-agent systems. Test cases involving
cybersecurity tasks indicate feasibility of the architecture and evaluation
approach. In particular, the results show the evaluation of question answering,
server security, and network security tasks that were completed correctly by
agents with LLMs from OpenAI and DeepSeek.

Motivation: 传统数据安全方法在未来量子计算机时代可能失效，因此需要更强大的保护手段。

Method: 采用量子密钥分发（QKD）和BB84协议生成安全密钥，并使用量子一次性密码本（QOTP）进行数据加密。

Result: 研究表明，量子密码学方法能有效保护云数据，即使面对量子计算机攻击。

Conclusion: 量子密码学为云计算提供了当前和未来的安全解决方案，确保数据存储和共享的安全性。

Abstract: Cloud computing has made storing and accessing data easier but keeping it
secure is a big challenge nowadays. Traditional methods of ensuring data may
not be strong enough in the future when powerful quantum computers become
available. To solve this problem, this study uses quantum cryptography to
protect data in the cloud environment. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) creates
secure keys by sending information using quantum particles like photons.
Specifically, we use the BB84 protocol, a simple and reliable way to make
secure keys that cannot be stolen without detection. To protect the data, we
use the Quantum One Time pad (QOTP) for encryption and decryption, ensuring the
data stays completely private. This study shows how these Quantum methods can
be applied in cloud systems to provide a strong defense against hackers, even
if they have access to quantum computers. The combination of QKD, BB84, and
QOTP creates a safe and reliable way to keep data secure when it is stored or
shared in the cloud. Using quantum cryptography, this paper provides a way to
ensure data security now and in the future, making cloud computing safer for
everyone to store their data securely and safely.

Motivation: 尽管LLM取得了显著进展，但其部署暴露了安全漏洞，尤其是绕过安全机制的越狱攻击。防护栏作为外部防御机制，缺乏统一分类和评估框架。

Method: 通过系统化知识（SoK）方法，提出六维分类法和安全-效率-实用性评估框架，分析现有防护栏的优劣和通用性。

Result: 研究发现现有防护栏的优缺点，并探讨了其在不同攻击类型中的通用性，为优化防御组合提供了见解。

Conclusion: 该研究为未来LLM防护栏的研究和开发提供了结构化基础，旨在推动其稳健部署。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, but their
deployment has exposed critical vulnerabilities, particularly to jailbreak
attacks that circumvent safety mechanisms. Guardrails--external defense
mechanisms that monitor and control LLM interaction--have emerged as a
promising solution. However, the current landscape of LLM guardrails is
fragmented, lacking a unified taxonomy and comprehensive evaluation framework.
In this Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) paper, we present the first holistic
analysis of jailbreak guardrails for LLMs. We propose a novel,
multi-dimensional taxonomy that categorizes guardrails along six key
dimensions, and introduce a Security-Efficiency-Utility evaluation framework to
assess their practical effectiveness. Through extensive analysis and
experiments, we identify the strengths and limitations of existing guardrail
approaches, explore their universality across attack types, and provide
insights into optimizing defense combinations. Our work offers a structured
foundation for future research and development, aiming to guide the principled
advancement and deployment of robust LLM guardrails. The code is available at

TL;DR: TED-LaST 是一种新型防御策略，通过标签监督的动态跟踪和自适应层强调，增强了对自适应后门攻击的检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络（DNNs）易受后门攻击，现有拓扑演化动力学（TED）检测方法对自适应攻击的鲁棒性不足。

Method: 提出 TED-LaST，结合标签监督动态跟踪和自适应层强调，改进 TED 的鲁棒性。

Result: 在多个数据集和模型上验证，TED-LaST 能有效对抗复杂后门攻击。

Conclusion: TED-LaST 为后门检测设定了新标准，显著提升了 DNN 的安全性。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where
attackers implant hidden triggers during training to maliciously control model
behavior. Topological Evolution Dynamics (TED) has recently emerged as a
powerful tool for detecting backdoor attacks in DNNs. However, TED can be
vulnerable to backdoor attacks that adaptively distort topological
representation distributions across network layers. To address this limitation,
we propose TED-LaST (Topological Evolution Dynamics against Laundry, Slow
release, and Target mapping attack strategies), a novel defense strategy that
enhances TED's robustness against adaptive attacks. TED-LaST introduces two key
innovations: label-supervised dynamics tracking and adaptive layer emphasis.
These enhancements enable the identification of stealthy threats that evade
traditional TED-based defenses, even in cases of inseparability in topological
space and subtle topological perturbations. We review and classify data
poisoning tricks in state-of-the-art adaptive attacks and propose enhanced
adaptive attack with target mapping, which can dynamically shift malicious
tasks and fully leverage the stealthiness that adaptive attacks possess. Our
comprehensive experiments on multiple datasets (CIFAR-10, GTSRB, and
ImageNet100) and model architectures (ResNet20, ResNet101) show that TED-LaST
effectively counteracts sophisticated backdoors like Adap-Blend, Adapt-Patch,
and the proposed enhanced adaptive attack. TED-LaST sets a new benchmark for
robust backdoor detection, substantially enhancing DNN security against
evolving threats.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于SilentBadDiffusion（SBD）的多元素（ME）攻击方法，通过增加每个毒样本的有毒视觉-文本元素数量来增强攻击能力，同时引入离散余弦变换（DCT）以保持隐蔽性。实验结果表明，该方法在两个新数据集上的表现接近或优于基准数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成扩散模型（如Stable Diffusion）可能被攻击者利用训练数据复制能力发起版权侵权攻击。现有方法SBD在攻击性能上表现优异，但可用数据资源有限且部分受限，且攻击效果在少量毒样本情况下不理想。

Method: 提出了多元素（ME）攻击方法，基于SBD增加每个毒样本的有毒元素数量，并引入DCT以保持隐蔽性。同时，提供了新的数据集用于研究此类攻击。

Result: 在两个新数据集上，ME方法的版权侵权率（CIR）和首次攻击轮次（FAE）分别为16.78%/39.50和51.20%/23.60，接近或优于基准数据集。在低采样率（5%）下，ME和DCT的表现优于原始SBD。

Conclusion: ME攻击方法在增强攻击能力的同时保持了隐蔽性，新数据集为相关研究提供了更多资源，实验结果表明其优于现有方法。

Abstract: The capability of generative diffusion models (DMs) like Stable Diffusion
(SD) in replicating training data could be taken advantage of by attackers to
launch the Copyright Infringement Attack, with duplicated poisoned image-text
pairs. SilentBadDiffusion (SBD) is a method proposed recently, which shew
outstanding performance in attacking SD in text-to-image tasks. However, the
feasible data resources in this area are still limited, some of them are even
constrained or prohibited due to the issues like copyright ownership or
inappropriate contents; And not all of the images in current datasets are
suitable for the proposed attacking methods; Besides, the state-of-the-art
(SoTA) performance of SBD is far from ideal when few generated poisoning
samples could be adopted for attacks. In this paper, we raised new datasets
accessible for researching in attacks like SBD, and proposed Multi-Element (ME)
attack method based on SBD by increasing the number of poisonous visual-text
elements per poisoned sample to enhance the ability of attacking, while
importing Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) for the poisoned samples to maintain
the stealthiness. The Copyright Infringement Rate (CIR) / First Attack Epoch
(FAE) we got on the two new datasets were 16.78% / 39.50 and 51.20% / 23.60,
respectively close to or even outperformed benchmark Pokemon and Mijourney
datasets. In condition of low subsampling ratio (5%, 6 poisoned samples), MESI
and DCT earned CIR / FAE of 0.23% / 84.00 and 12.73% / 65.50, both better than
original SBD, which failed to attack at all.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对Tree-Ring水印技术的新型攻击方法，仅需利用公开的变分自编码器即可显著降低检测器的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tree-Ring水印技术因其高隐蔽性和抗攻击性而受到关注，但现有攻击方法依赖强假设。本文旨在探索一种更实际的攻击方式。

Method: 通过利用训练目标扩散模型时使用的公开变分自编码器，攻击者近似模型的潜在空间，从而实施更有效的代理攻击。

Result: 攻击使Tree-Ring检测器的AUC从0.993降至0.153（ROC曲线）和0.994降至0.385（PR曲线），同时保持图像质量。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了复用公开自编码器训练扩散模型的风险，并指出Tree-Ring检测器的精度不足，需改进以适用于实际部署。

Abstract: We present a novel attack specifically designed against Tree-Ring, a
watermarking technique for diffusion models known for its high imperceptibility
and robustness against removal attacks. Unlike previous removal attacks, which
rely on strong assumptions about attacker capabilities, our attack only
requires access to the variational autoencoder that was used to train the
target diffusion model, a component that is often publicly available. By
leveraging this variational autoencoder, the attacker can approximate the
model's intermediate latent space, enabling more effective surrogate-based
attacks. Our evaluation shows that this approach leads to a dramatic reduction
in the AUC of Tree-Ring detector's ROC and PR curves, decreasing from 0.993 to
0.153 and from 0.994 to 0.385, respectively, while maintaining high image
quality. Notably, our attacks outperform existing methods that assume full
access to the diffusion model. These findings highlight the risk of reusing
public autoencoders to train diffusion models -- a threat not considered by
current industry practices. Furthermore, the results suggest that the Tree-Ring
detector's precision, a metric that has been overlooked by previous
evaluations, falls short of the requirements for real-world deployment.

Motivation: 现代车辆安全性日益重要，但CAN总线缺乏强大安全措施，易受网络攻击。现有IDS并非完全可靠，对抗攻击可能绕过检测。

Method: 通过白盒、灰盒和黑盒三种攻击场景，评估梯度对抗攻击对汽车IDS的效果，并分析攻击对数据集质量、目标IDS和攻击者知识的依赖性。

Result: 攻击效果受数据集质量、目标IDS和攻击者知识程度影响显著，攻击在汽车领域具有挑战性。

Conclusion: 研究表明，对抗攻击的可行性和效果与多种因素相关，需进一步优化IDS以应对此类威胁。

Abstract: The security of modern vehicles has become increasingly important, with the
controller area network (CAN) bus serving as a critical communication backbone
for various Electronic Control Units (ECUs). The absence of robust security
measures in CAN, coupled with the increasing connectivity of vehicles, makes
them susceptible to cyberattacks. While intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have
been developed to counter such threats, they are not foolproof. Adversarial
attacks, particularly evasion attacks, can manipulate inputs to bypass
detection by IDSs. This paper extends our previous work by investigating the
feasibility and impact of gradient-based adversarial attacks performed with
different degrees of knowledge against automotive IDSs. We consider three
scenarios: white-box (attacker with full system knowledge), grey-box (partial
system knowledge), and the more realistic black-box (no knowledge of the IDS'
internal workings or data). We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed
attacks against state-of-the-art IDSs on two publicly available datasets.
Additionally, we study effect of the adversarial perturbation on the attack
impact and evaluate real-time feasibility by precomputing evasive payloads for
timed injection based on bus traffic. Our results demonstrate that, besides
attacks being challenging due to the automotive domain constraints, their
effectiveness is strongly dependent on the dataset quality, the target IDS, and
the attacker's degree of knowledge.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM安全防御无法应对分解攻击，恶意意图通过看似良性的子任务序列隐藏，亟需更有效的监控方法。

Method: 提出外部监控器，构建多样化数据集验证攻击有效性，设计轻量级顺序监控框架实时防御。

Result: 分解攻击平均成功率达87%；轻量级监控框架防御成功率达93%，成本降低90%，延迟减少50%。

Conclusion: 轻量级顺序监控框架能有效防御分解攻击，具备实际部署可行性。

Abstract: Current LLM safety defenses fail under decomposition attacks, where a
malicious goal is decomposed into benign subtasks that circumvent refusals. The
challenge lies in the existing shallow safety alignment techniques: they only
detect harm in the immediate prompt and do not reason about long-range intent,
leaving them blind to malicious intent that emerges over a sequence of
seemingly benign instructions. We therefore propose adding an external monitor
that observes the conversation at a higher granularity. To facilitate our study
of monitoring decomposition attacks, we curate the largest and most diverse
dataset to date, including question-answering, text-to-image, and agentic
tasks. We verify our datasets by testing them on frontier LLMs and show an 87%
attack success rate on average on GPT-4o. This confirms that decomposition
attack is broadly effective. Additionally, we find that random tasks can be
injected into the decomposed subtasks to further obfuscate malicious intents.
To defend in real time, we propose a lightweight sequential monitoring
framework that cumulatively evaluates each subtask. We show that a carefully
prompt engineered lightweight monitor achieves a 93% defense success rate,
beating reasoning models like o3 mini as a monitor. Moreover, it remains robust
against random task injection and cuts cost by 90% and latency by 50%. Our
findings suggest that lightweight sequential monitors are highly effective in
mitigating decomposition attacks and are viable in deployment.

TL;DR: FastFLUX是一种架构级剪枝框架，旨在提升FLUX模型的推理效率，通过BRLL方法和ST训练策略，在保持图像质量的同时显著加速推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像生成模型（如FLUX）参数庞大，推理速度慢且部署困难，现有加速方法性能下降明显且训练成本高。

Method: 提出Block-wise Replacement with Linear Layers (BRLL)方法替换复杂残差分支，并结合Sandwich Training (ST)策略进行局部微调。

Result: FastFLUX在剪除20%层级结构后仍保持高质量图像生成，并显著提升推理速度。

Conclusion: FastFLUX通过架构优化有效解决了FLUX模型的推理效率问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) generation have led to the
emergence of highly expressive models such as diffusion transformers (DiTs),
exemplified by FLUX. However, their massive parameter sizes lead to slow
inference, high memory usage, and poor deployability. Existing acceleration
methods (e.g., single-step distillation and attention pruning) often suffer
from significant performance degradation and incur substantial training costs.
To address these limitations, we propose FastFLUX, an architecture-level
pruning framework designed to enhance the inference efficiency of FLUX. At its
core is the Block-wise Replacement with Linear Layers (BRLL) method, which
replaces structurally complex residual branches in ResBlocks with lightweight
linear layers while preserving the original shortcut connections for stability.
Furthermore, we introduce Sandwich Training (ST), a localized fine-tuning
strategy that leverages LoRA to supervise neighboring blocks, mitigating
performance drops caused by structural replacement. Experiments show that our
FastFLUX maintains high image quality under both qualitative and quantitative
evaluations, while significantly improving inference speed, even with 20\% of
the hierarchy pruned. Our code will be available soon.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散模型依赖高质量数据集，但低质量图像中蕴含的信息被忽视。

Method: 提出Ambient Diffusion Omni框架，利用图像的光谱幂律衰减和局部性特性，从所有可用图像中提取信号。

Result: 在ImageNet上实现最佳FID，提升文本到图像生成的质量和多样性。

Conclusion: 噪声可平衡高质量分布与混合分布之间的偏差，理论分析验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: We show how to use low-quality, synthetic, and out-of-distribution images to
improve the quality of a diffusion model. Typically, diffusion models are
trained on curated datasets that emerge from highly filtered data pools from
the Web and other sources. We show that there is immense value in the
lower-quality images that are often discarded. We present Ambient Diffusion
Omni, a simple, principled framework to train diffusion models that can extract
signal from all available images during training. Our framework exploits two
properties of natural images -- spectral power law decay and locality. We first
validate our framework by successfully training diffusion models with images
synthetically corrupted by Gaussian blur, JPEG compression, and motion blur. We
then use our framework to achieve state-of-the-art ImageNet FID, and we show
significant improvements in both image quality and diversity for text-to-image
generative modeling. The core insight is that noise dampens the initial skew
between the desired high-quality distribution and the mixed distribution we
actually observe. We provide rigorous theoretical justification for our
approach by analyzing the trade-off between learning from biased data versus
limited unbiased data across diffusion times.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统密度均衡映射方法存在精度有限、极端情况下产生重叠伪影以及从2D扩展到3D时需重新设计算法的问题。

Method: 使用深度神经网络，引入强制密度均匀性和几何规则性的损失函数，并采用分层方法预测粗粒度和密集级别的变换。

Result: LDEM在多种密度分布下表现出优于传统方法的密度均衡性和双射性，并可轻松应用于表面重网格化。

Conclusion: LDEM为密度均衡映射的可扩展和鲁棒计算提供了新可能性。

Abstract: Density-equalizing map (DEM) serves as a powerful technique for creating
shape deformations with the area changes reflecting an underlying density
function. In recent decades, DEM has found widespread applications in fields
such as data visualization, geometry processing, and medical imaging.
Traditional approaches to DEM primarily rely on iterative numerical solvers for
diffusion equations or optimization-based methods that minimize handcrafted
energy functionals. However, these conventional techniques often face several
challenges: they may suffer from limited accuracy, produce overlapping
artifacts in extreme cases, and require substantial algorithmic redesign when
extended from 2D to 3D, due to the derivative-dependent nature of their energy
formulations. In this work, we propose a novel learning-based
density-equalizing mapping framework (LDEM) using deep neural networks.
Specifically, we introduce a loss function that enforces density uniformity and
geometric regularity, and utilize a hierarchical approach to predict the
transformations at both the coarse and dense levels. Our method demonstrates
superior density-equalizing and bijectivity properties compared to prior
methods for a wide range of simple and complex density distributions, and can
be easily applied to surface remeshing with different effects. Also, it
generalizes seamlessly from 2D to 3D domains without structural changes to the
model architecture or loss formulation. Altogether, our work opens up new
possibilities for scalable and robust computation of density-equalizing maps
for practical applications.

Conclusion: 该方法降低了数据采集门槛，提升了虚拟试衣的实用性和用户体验。

Abstract: Existing image-based virtual try-on methods are often limited to the front
view and lack real-time performance. While per-garment virtual try-on methods
have tackled these issues by capturing per-garment datasets and training
per-garment neural networks, they still encounter practical limitations: (1)
the robotic mannequin used to capture per-garment datasets is prohibitively
expensive for widespread adoption and fails to accurately replicate natural
human body deformation; (2) the synthesized garments often misalign with the
human body. To address these challenges, we propose a low-barrier approach for
collecting per-garment datasets using real human bodies, eliminating the
necessity for a customized robotic mannequin. We also introduce a hybrid person
representation that enhances the existing intermediate representation with a
simplified DensePose map. This ensures accurate alignment of synthesized
garment images with the human body and enables human-garment interaction
without the need for customized wearable devices. We performed qualitative and
quantitative evaluations against other state-of-the-art image-based virtual
try-on methods and conducted ablation studies to demonstrate the superiority of
our method regarding image quality and temporal consistency. Finally, our user
study results indicated that most participants found our virtual try-on system
helpful for making garment purchasing decisions.

*Junchao Huang,Xinting Hu,Zhuotao Tian,Shaoshuai Shi,Li Jiang*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: Edit360是一个无需调整的框架，将2D编辑扩展到多视角一致的3D编辑，解决了现有方法在视角限制和一致性上的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在3D资产编辑中面临多视角一致性和灵活性不足的挑战，限制了实际应用。

Method: 基于视频扩散模型，Edit360通过锚点视图选择和编辑传播机制，在潜在和注意力空间中实现多视角信息对齐与合并。

Result: Edit360能够从任意视角进行用户定制编辑，并生成高质量的多视角序列，支持3D内容重建。

Conclusion: Edit360为3D资产编辑提供了灵活且一致的解决方案，推动了可定制3D内容创作的发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved image
generation and editing, but extending these capabilities to 3D assets remains
challenging, especially for fine-grained edits that require multi-view
consistency. Existing methods typically restrict editing to predetermined
viewing angles, severely limiting their flexibility and practical applications.
We introduce Edit360, a tuning-free framework that extends 2D modifications to
multi-view consistent 3D editing. Built upon video diffusion models, Edit360
enables user-specific editing from arbitrary viewpoints while ensuring
structural coherence across all views. The framework selects anchor views for
2D modifications and propagates edits across the entire 360-degree range. To
achieve this, Edit360 introduces a novel Anchor-View Editing Propagation
mechanism, which effectively aligns and merges multi-view information within
the latent and attention spaces of diffusion models. The resulting edited
multi-view sequences facilitate the reconstruction of high-quality 3D assets,
enabling customizable 3D content creation.

*Chengxu Zuo,Jiawei Huang,Xiao Jiang,Yuan Yao,Xiangren Shi,Rui Cao,Xinyu Yi,Feng Xu,Shihui Guo,Yipeng Qin*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型的动态校准方法，打破了传统IMU校准中绝对静态假设的限制，实现了实时校准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统IMU校准方法依赖绝对静态假设，限制了应用场景。本文旨在通过动态校准扩展IMU的使用范围。

Method: 基于两个宽松假设（短时间窗口内矩阵变化可忽略；运动多样性），使用Transformer模型学习矩阵映射，并设计校准触发器。

Result: 首次实现了隐式IMU校准和稀疏IMU长期精准运动捕捉。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了IMU校准的灵活性和实用性，为稀疏IMU运动捕捉开辟了新途径。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic calibration method for sparse
inertial motion capture systems, which is the first to break the restrictive
absolute static assumption in IMU calibration, i.e., the coordinate drift RG'G
and measurement offset RBS remain constant during the entire motion, thereby
significantly expanding their application scenarios. Specifically, we achieve
real-time estimation of RG'G and RBS under two relaxed assumptions: i) the
matrices change negligibly in a short time window; ii) the human movements/IMU
readings are diverse in such a time window. Intuitively, the first assumption
reduces the number of candidate matrices, and the second assumption provides
diverse constraints, which greatly reduces the solution space and allows for
accurate estimation of RG'G and RBS from a short history of IMU readings in
real time. To achieve this, we created synthetic datasets of paired RG'G, RBS
matrices and IMU readings, and learned their mappings using a Transformer-based
model. We also designed a calibration trigger based on the diversity of IMU
readings to ensure that assumption ii) is met before applying our method. To
our knowledge, we are the first to achieve implicit IMU calibration (i.e.,
seamlessly putting IMUs into use without the need for an explicit calibration
process), as well as the first to enable long-term and accurate motion capture
using sparse IMUs. The code and dataset are available at

TL;DR: CARE是一个用于酶分类和检索的标准化基准和数据集套件，包含分类和检索任务，并提供了基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏评估机器学习方法预测酶功能的标准化基准，因此需要CARE来填补这一空白。

Result: CARE提供了基线方法，并展示了CREEP与CLIPZyme的比较结果。

Conclusion: CARE为酶功能预测提供了标准化评估工具，并推动了该领域的研究。

Abstract: Enzymes are important proteins that catalyze chemical reactions. In recent
years, machine learning methods have emerged to predict enzyme function from
sequence; however, there are no standardized benchmarks to evaluate these
methods. We introduce CARE, a benchmark and dataset suite for the
Classification And Retrieval of Enzymes (CARE). CARE centers on two tasks: (1)
classification of a protein sequence by its enzyme commission (EC) number and
(2) retrieval of an EC number given a chemical reaction. For each task, we
design train-test splits to evaluate different kinds of out-of-distribution
generalization that are relevant to real use cases. For the classification
task, we provide baselines for state-of-the-art methods. Because the retrieval
task has not been previously formalized, we propose a method called Contrastive
Reaction-EnzymE Pretraining (CREEP) as one of the first baselines for this task
and compare it to the recent method, CLIPZyme. CARE is available at
https://github.com/jsunn-y/CARE/.

TL;DR: 论文提出了三种识别蛋白质关键残基的方法，基于随机几何图（RGG）学习，并通过分子动力学模拟验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别蛋白质关键残基对理解其功能至关重要。

Method: 1. 基于RGG学习，利用残基对状态变量的相关性矩阵；2. 提出有机阈值法；3. 开发新的关键性度量方法，通过比较全图和缺一残基图的后验概率差异。

Result: 三种方法的结果与实验验证的关键残基进行了比较。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效识别关键残基，为蛋白质功能研究提供新工具。

Abstract: Identification of critical residues of a protein is actively pursued, since
such residues are essential for protein function. We present three ways of
recognising critical residues of an example protein, the evolution of which is
tracked via molecular dynamical simulations. Our methods are based on learning
a Random Geometric Graph (RGG) variable, where the state variable of each of
156 residues, is attached to a node of this graph, with the RGG learnt using
the matrix of correlations between state variables of each residue-pair. Given
the categorical nature of the state variable, correlation between a residue
pair is computed using Cramer's V. We advance an organic thresholding to learn
an RGG, and compare results against extant thresholding techniques, when
parametrising criticality as the nodal degree in the learnt RGG. Secondly, we
develop a criticality measure by ranking the computed differences between the
posterior probability of the full graph variable defined on all 156 residues,
and that of the graph with all but one residue omitted. A third parametrisation
of criticality informs on the dynamical variation of nodal degrees as the
protein evolves during the simulation. Finally, we compare results obtained
with the three distinct criticality parameters, against
experimentally-ascertained critical residues.

TL;DR: LayoutCoder是一个基于多模态大语言模型的框架，用于从网页图像生成UI代码，通过三个关键模块解决布局理解和代码生成问题，并在性能上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化UI2Code任务对提高开发效率至关重要，但现有深度学习方法依赖大量标注数据且泛化能力不足，多模态大语言模型虽具潜力但难以处理复杂布局。

Method: LayoutCoder包含三个模块：元素关系构建、UI布局解析和布局引导的代码融合，分别处理组件分组、布局树生成和代码生成。

Result: 在Snap2Code和Design2Code数据集上，LayoutCoder在BLEU和CLIP分数上分别平均提升10.14%和3.95%。

Conclusion: LayoutCoder通过结合布局理解和代码生成，显著提升了UI2Code任务的性能，为实际应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Converting user interfaces into code (UI2Code) is a crucial step in website
development, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. The automation of
UI2Code is essential to streamline this task, beneficial for improving the
development efficiency. There exist deep learning-based methods for the task;
however, they heavily rely on a large amount of labeled training data and
struggle with generalizing to real-world, unseen web page designs. The advent
of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) presents potential for alleviating
the issue, but they are difficult to comprehend the complex layouts in UIs and
generate the accurate code with layout preserved. To address these issues, we
propose LayoutCoder, a novel MLLM-based framework generating UI code from
real-world webpage images, which includes three key modules: (1) Element
Relation Construction, which aims at capturing UI layout by identifying and
grouping components with similar structures; (2) UI Layout Parsing, which aims
at generating UI layout trees for guiding the subsequent code generation
process; and (3) Layout-Guided Code Fusion, which aims at producing the
accurate code with layout preserved. For evaluation, we build a new benchmark
dataset which involves 350 real-world websites named Snap2Code, divided into
seen and unseen parts for mitigating the data leakage issue, besides the
popular dataset Design2Code. Extensive evaluation shows the superior
performance of LayoutCoder over the state-of-the-art approaches. Compared with
the best-performing baseline, LayoutCoder improves 10.14% in the BLEU score and
3.95% in the CLIP score on average across all datasets.

TL;DR: 该研究通过将大型语言模型（如GPT-3.5 Turbo和GPT-4o）集成到软件开发工作流中，实现了代码问题的自动检测与修订。结合静态代码分析框架和检索增强生成（RAG），显著减少了代码问题，提高了开发效率。

Motivation: 旨在利用LLMs提升代码质量，减少开发时间和资源消耗，同时解决模型幻觉问题。

Method: 采用静态代码分析框架检测问题，结合LLMs和RAG进行自动化修订，并通过代码比较工具纠正错误。

Result: 代码问题显著减少，验证了LLMs与静态分析结合的有效性。

Conclusion: LLMs、静态分析和RAG的结合能够高效提升代码质量，优化开发流程。

Abstract: This study examined code issue detection and revision automation by
integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo and
GPT-4o into software development workflows. A static code analysis framework
detects issues such as bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells within a
large-scale software project. Detailed information on each issue was extracted
and organized to facilitate automated code revision using LLMs. An iterative
prompt engineering process is applied to ensure that prompts are structured to
produce accurate and organized outputs aligned with the project requirements.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is implemented to enhance the relevance
and precision of the revisions, enabling LLM to access and integrate real-time
external knowledge. The issue of LLM hallucinations - where the model generates
plausible but incorrect outputs - is addressed by a custom-built "Code
Comparison App," which identifies and corrects erroneous changes before
applying them to the codebase. Subsequent scans using the static code analysis
framework revealed a significant reduction in code issues, demonstrating the
effectiveness of combining LLMs, static analysis, and RAG to improve code
quality, streamline the software development process, and reduce time and
resource expenditure.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种评估LLM代码生成的合成管道和基于角色的方法，以量化输入变化对生成代码质量的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM降低了编写代码的门槛，但生成代码的质量受用户背景和提示质量影响，需量化这种敏感性。

Method: 提出了独立于具体任务和LLM的合成评估管道和基于角色的系统评估方法。

Result: 实验证明了方法的实用性，并公开了代码供社区使用。

Conclusion: 该研究为评估LLM代码生成提供了广泛适用的工具，有助于理解输入变化对输出的影响。

Abstract: Code generation is one of the most active areas of application of Large
Language Models (LLMs). While LLMs lower barriers to writing code and
accelerate development process, the overall quality of generated programs
depends on the quality of given prompts. Specifically, functionality and
quality of generated code can be sensitive to user's background and familiarity
with software development. It is therefore important to quantify LLM's
sensitivity to variations in the input. To this end we propose a synthetic
evaluation pipeline for code generation with LLMs, as well as a systematic
persona-based evaluation approach to expose qualitative differences of LLM
responses dependent on prospective user background. Both proposed methods are
completely independent from specific programming tasks and LLMs, and thus are
widely applicable. We provide experimental evidence illustrating utility of our
methods and share our code for the benefit of the community.

Motivation: 研究用户对AI功能在移动应用中的感知与评价，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 利用292个AI驱动的应用和894K条用户评论，开发多阶段分析流程，包括分类、情感提取和聚类。

Result: 用户反馈集中在少数主题上，正面评价关注生产力和可靠性，负面反馈涉及技术问题和定价。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能更准确地反映用户对AI功能的真实体验，揭示了通用满意度和领域特定问题。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered features have rapidly proliferated
across mobile apps in various domains, including productivity, education,
entertainment, and creativity. However, how users perceive, evaluate, and
critique these AI features remains largely unexplored, primarily due to the
overwhelming volume of user feedback. In this work, we present the first
comprehensive, large-scale study of user feedback on AI-powered mobile apps,
leveraging a curated dataset of 292 AI-driven apps across 14 categories with
894K AI-specific reviews from Google Play. We develop and validate a
multi-stage analysis pipeline that begins with a human-labeled benchmark and
systematically evaluates large language models (LLMs) and prompting strategies.
Each stage, including review classification, aspect-sentiment extraction, and
clustering, is validated for accuracy and consistency. Our pipeline enables
scalable, high-precision analysis of user feedback, extracting over one million
aspect-sentiment pairs clustered into 18 positive and 15 negative user topics.
Our analysis reveals that users consistently focus on a narrow set of themes:
positive comments emphasize productivity, reliability, and personalized
assistance, while negative feedback highlights technical failures (e.g.,
scanning and recognition), pricing concerns, and limitations in language
support. Our pipeline surfaces both satisfaction with one feature and
frustration with another within the same review. These fine-grained,
co-occurring sentiments are often missed by traditional approaches that treat
positive and negative feedback in isolation or rely on coarse-grained analysis.
To this end, our approach provides a more faithful reflection of the real-world
user experiences with AI-powered apps. Category-aware analysis further uncovers
both universal drivers of satisfaction and domain-specific frustrations.

Motivation: 硬件复杂性增加了验证资源的压力，需要机器学习方法提升调试效率，但现有方法难以生成多样且可扩展的错误数据集。

Method: BugGen采用多代理闭环架构，通过模块分区、目标选择和迭代优化，确保生成错误的语法正确性和功能可检测性。

Result: 在OpenTitan IP块上生成500个独特错误，功能准确率达94%，并发现104个未检测错误，验证效率是人工的5倍。

Conclusion: BugGen为高质量错误数据集生成提供了可扩展解决方案，显著提升了验证效率和机器学习辅助调试的实用性。

Abstract: Hardware complexity continues to strain verification resources, motivating
the adoption of machine learning (ML) methods to improve debug efficiency.
However, ML-assisted debugging critically depends on diverse and scalable bug
datasets, which existing manual or automated bug insertion methods fail to
reliably produce. We introduce BugGen, a first of its kind, fully autonomous,
multi-agent pipeline leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to systematically
generate, insert, and validate realistic functional bugs in RTL. BugGen
partitions modules, selects mutation targets via a closed-loop agentic
architecture, and employs iterative refinement and rollback mechanisms to
ensure syntactic correctness and functional detectability. Evaluated across
five OpenTitan IP blocks, BugGen produced 500 unique bugs with 94% functional
accuracy and achieved a throughput of 17.7 validated bugs per hour-over five
times faster than typical manual expert insertion. Additionally, BugGen
identified 104 previously undetected bugs in OpenTitan regressions,
highlighting its utility in exposing verification coverage gaps. Compared
against Certitude, BugGen demonstrated over twice the syntactic accuracy,
deeper exposure of testbench blind spots, and more functionally meaningful and
complex bug scenarios. Furthermore, when these BugGen-generated datasets were
employed to train ML-based failure triage models, we achieved high
classification accuracy (88.1%-93.2%) across different IP blocks, confirming
the practical utility and realism of generated bugs. BugGen thus provides a
scalable solution for generating high-quality bug datasets, significantly
enhancing verification efficiency and ML-assisted debugging.

Motivation: 构建大规模数据集对训练和评估LLMs的软件工程能力至关重要，但传统方法成本高且效率低。

Method: SWE-Factory整合了三个自动化组件：SWE-Builder（多智能体系统）、标准化退出码评分方法和自动化fail2pass验证。

Result: 实验显示，SWE-Factory能高效构建有效任务实例（如GPT-4.1-mini每实例$0.045），评分准确率100%，验证精度0.92。

Conclusion: SWE-Factory为GitHub问题解决任务提供了高效、低成本的自动化解决方案，有望加速高质量数据集的构建。

Abstract: Constructing large-scale datasets for the GitHub issue resolution task is
crucial for both training and evaluating the software engineering capabilities
of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the traditional process for creating
such benchmarks is notoriously challenging and labor-intensive, particularly in
the stages of setting up evaluation environments, grading test outcomes, and
validating task instances. In this paper, we propose SWE-Factory, an automated
pipeline designed to address these challenges. To tackle these issues, our
pipeline integrates three core automated components. First, we introduce
SWE-Builder, a multi-agent system that automates evaluation environment
construction, which employs four specialized agents that work in a
collaborative, iterative loop and leverages an environment memory pool to
enhance efficiency. Second, we introduce a standardized, exit-code-based
grading method that eliminates the need for manually writing custom parsers.
Finally, we automate the fail2pass validation process using these reliable exit
code signals. Experiments on 671 issues across four programming languages show
that our pipeline can effectively construct valid task instances; for example,
with GPT-4.1-mini, our SWE-Builder constructs 269 valid instances at $0.045 per
instance, while with Gemini-2.5-flash, it achieves comparable performance at
the lowest cost of $0.024 per instance. We also demonstrate that our
exit-code-based grading achieves 100% accuracy compared to manual inspection,
and our automated fail2pass validation reaches a precision of 0.92 and a recall
of 1.00. We hope our automated pipeline will accelerate the collection of
large-scale, high-quality GitHub issue resolution datasets for both training
and evaluation. Our code and datasets are released at
https://github.com/DeepSoftwareAnalytics/swe-factory.

Motivation: 月球表面无线通信系统需要满足自主性、抗干扰性和环境适应性等严格要求，而现有Space-O-RAN的决策逻辑仅依赖静态策略且缺乏语义集成。

Method: 通过引入Model Context Protocol (MCP)和Agent-to-Agent (A2A)通信协议，构建语义代理层，实现跨实时、近实时和非实时控制层的上下文感知决策。

Result: 分布式认知代理在月球车、着陆器和基站中部署，支持延迟自适应推理和带宽感知语义压缩，并与MCP服务器交互以处理遥测、运动规划和任务约束。

Conclusion: 该方案显著提升了月球表面无线通信系统的自主性和适应性，为未来任务提供了更高效的通信支持。

Abstract: Lunar surface operations impose stringent requirements on wireless
communication systems, including autonomy, robustness to disruption, and the
ability to adapt to environmental and mission-driven context. While Space-O-RAN
provides a distributed orchestration model aligned with 3GPP standards, its
decision logic is limited to static policies and lacks semantic integration. We
propose a novel extension incorporating a semantic agentic layer enabled by the
Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication protocols,
allowing context-aware decision making across real-time, near-real-time, and
non-real-time control layers. Distributed cognitive agents deployed in rovers,
landers, and lunar base stations implement wireless-aware coordination
strategies, including delay-adaptive reasoning and bandwidth-aware semantic
compression, while interacting with multiple MCP servers to reason over
telemetry, locomotion planning, and mission constraints.

Motivation: O-RAN的分散架构带来了复杂的测试挑战，现有手动测试框架效率低且易出错，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: AI5GTest利用Gen-LLM、Val-LLM和Debug-LLM三个LLM模型分别生成测试流程、验证合规性和分析故障原因，并结合人工审核机制。

Result: AI5GTest显著减少了测试时间，同时保持了高验证准确性。

Conclusion: AI5GTest为O-RAN组件的自动化测试提供了高效、可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: The advent of Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN) has transformed the
telecommunications industry by promoting interoperability, vendor diversity,
and rapid innovation. However, its disaggregated architecture introduces
complex testing challenges, particularly in validating multi-vendor components
against O-RAN ALLIANCE and 3GPP specifications. Existing frameworks, such as
those provided by Open Testing and Integration Centres (OTICs), rely heavily on
manual processes, are fragmented and prone to human error, leading to
inconsistency and scalability issues. To address these limitations, we present
AI5GTest -- an AI-powered, specification-aware testing framework designed to
automate the validation of O-RAN components. AI5GTest leverages a cooperative
Large Language Models (LLM) framework consisting of Gen-LLM, Val-LLM, and
Debug-LLM. Gen-LLM automatically generates expected procedural flows for test
cases based on 3GPP and O-RAN specifications, while Val-LLM cross-references
signaling messages against these flows to validate compliance and detect
deviations. If anomalies arise, Debug-LLM performs root cause analysis,
providing insight to the failure cause. To enhance transparency and
trustworthiness, AI5GTest incorporates a human-in-the-loop mechanism, where the
Gen-LLM presents top-k relevant official specifications to the tester for
approval before proceeding with validation. Evaluated using a range of test
cases obtained from O-RAN TIFG and WG5-IOT test specifications, AI5GTest
demonstrates a significant reduction in overall test execution time compared to
traditional manual methods, while maintaining high validation accuracy.

parameters, a 20.12K maximum tensor size, and 10.08M floating-point operations
(FLOPs). Moreover, it generalizes across various TC tasks, with accuracies
ranging from 94% to 99%. To enable deployment, the model is quantized to INT8,
suffering only a marginal 1-2% accuracy drop relative to its Float32
counterpart. We evaluate real-world inference performance on two
microcontrollers: the high-performance STM32F746G-DISCO and the cost-sensitive
Nucleo-F401RE. The deployed model achieves inference latencies of 31.43ms and
115.40ms, with energy consumption of 7.86 mJ and 29.10 mJ per inference,
respectively. These results demonstrate the feasibility of on-device encrypted
traffic analysis, paving the way for scalable, low-power IoT security
solutions.

Conclusion: 论文为碰撞和冲击的建模提供了方法讨论和参数分析。

Abstract: Collisions and impacts are the principal reasons for impulsive motions, which
we frequently see in dynamic responses of systems. Precise modelling of impacts
is a challenging problem due to the lack of the accurate and commonly accepted
constitutive law that governs their mechanics. Rigid-body approach and soft
contact methods are discussed in this paper and examined in the presented
numerical examples. The main focus is set to impacts in systems with multiple
unilateral contacts and collisions with elastic elements of the reference.
Parameters of interconnecting unilateral springs are under discussion.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于分层图的A-Star启发式算法，用于在动态犯罪环境中优化警力资源分配，以拦截罪犯。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在动态犯罪环境中，罪犯位置不断变化，且交通网络庞大，如何高效分配有限的警力资源拦截罪犯是一个重大挑战。

Method: 采用分层图表示法，每个时间步复制交通网络，并使用A-Star启发式算法计算近最优的防御策略。

Result: 与混合整数线性规划（MILP）方法相比，该方法在计算效率和解决方案质量上表现更优。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效应对问题的复杂性，并在短时间内提供高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Intercepting a criminal using limited police resources presents a significant
challenge in dynamic crime environments, where the criminal's location
continuously changes over time. The complexity is further heightened by the
vastness of the transportation network. To tackle this problem, we propose a
layered graph representation, in which each time step is associated with a
duplicate of the transportation network. For any given set of attacker
strategies, a near-optimal defender strategy is computed using the A-Star
heuristic algorithm applied to the layered graph. The defender's goal is to
maximize the probability of successful interdiction. We evaluate the
performance of the proposed method by comparing it with a Mixed-Integer Linear
Programming (MILP) approach used for the defender. The comparison considers
both computational efficiency and solution quality. The results demonstrate
that our approach effectively addresses the complexity of the problem and
delivers high-quality solutions within a short computation time.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: VQC-MLPNet是一种新型混合量子-经典架构，通过量子电路动态生成经典多层感知器（MLP）的参数，解决了变分量子电路（VQC）在表达性、优化和噪声敏感性方面的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 变分量子电路（VQC）在量子机器学习中具有潜力，但受限于表达性不足、优化困难和噪声敏感等问题。

Method: 提出VQC-MLPNet，利用振幅编码和参数化量子操作为经典MLP动态生成参数，结合统计学习和神经切线核分析提供理论保证。

Result: 理论分析表明，VQC-MLPNet在表示能力和训练稳定性上显著优于传统量子电路和现有混合架构，实验验证了其在噪声环境下的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: VQC-MLPNet为量子增强学习提供了理论和实践上的稳健框架，推动了量子计算在NISQ时代及以后的应用。

Abstract: Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) offer a novel pathway for quantum machine
learning, yet their practical application is hindered by inherent limitations
such as constrained linear expressivity, optimization challenges, and acute
sensitivity to quantum hardware noise. This work introduces VQC-MLPNet, a
scalable and robust hybrid quantum-classical architecture designed to overcome
these obstacles. By innovatively employing quantum circuits to dynamically
generate parameters for classical Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) via amplitude
encoding and parameterized quantum operations, VQC-MLPNet substantially expands
representation capabilities and augments training stability. We provide
rigorous theoretical guarantees via statistical learning techniques and Neural
Tangent Kernel analysis, explicitly deriving upper bounds on approximation,
uniform deviation, and optimization errors. These theoretical insights
demonstrate exponential improvements in representation capacity relative to
quantum circuit depth and the number of qubits, providing clear computational
advantages over standalone quantum circuits and existing hybrid quantum
architectures. Our theoretical claims are empirically corroborated through
extensive experiments, including classifying semiconductor quantum-dot charge
states and predicting genomic transcription factor binding sites, demonstrating
resilient performance even under realistic IBM quantum noise simulations. This
research establishes a theoretically sound and practically robust framework,
advancing the frontiers of quantum-enhanced learning for unconventional
computing paradigms in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum era and beyond.

with a live REPL. By embedding Lisp expressions within generation and
intercepting them via a middleware layer, the system allows for stateful
external memory, reflective programming, and dynamic tool creation. We present
a design framework and architectural principles to guide future implementations
of interactive AI systems that integrate symbolic programming with neural

*Sarker Miraz Mahfuz,Thomas Slawig*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: 利用条件变分自编码器（CVAE）从少量生物地球化学模型参数映射到三维稳态年周期，显著减少spin-up所需的迭代次数和计算时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统spin-up方法计算成本高，需要大量迭代才能达到稳态，因此探索更高效的初始值生成方法以加速收敛。

Method: 使用CVAE构建参数到稳态年周期的映射，并将其预测结果作为spin-up的初始值。

Result: CVAE预测的初始值可将spin-up迭代次数减少50%-95%，显著优于传统均匀初始值或训练数据均值。

Conclusion: CVAE方法为spin-up提供了高效的初始值生成方案，大幅降低计算成本。

Abstract: We used precomputed steady states obtained by a spin-up for a global marine
ecosystem model as training data to build a mapping from the small number of
biogeochemical model parameters onto the three-dimensional converged steady
annual cycle. The mapping was performed by a conditional variational
autoencoder (CVAE) with mass correction. Applied for test data, we show that
the prediction obtained by the CVAE already gives a reasonable good
approximation of the steady states obtained by a regular spin-up. However, the
predictions do not reach the same level of annual periodicity as those obtained
in the original spin-up data. Thus, we took the predictions as initial values
for a spin-up. We could show that the number of necessary iterations,
corresponding to model years, to reach a prescribed stopping criterion in the
spin-up could be significantly reduced compared to the use of the originally
uniform, constant initial value. The amount of reduction depends on the applied
stopping criterion, measuring the periodicity of the solution. The savings in
needed iterations and, thus, computing time for the spin-up ranges from 50 to
95\%, depending on the stopping criterion for the spin-up. We compared these
results with the use of the mean of the training data as an initial value. We
found that this also accelerates the spin-up, but only by a much lower factor.

Motivation: 研究多尺度损失公式在天气预报模型中的应用，以改进小尺度变率的约束。

Method: 在AIFS-CRPS模型中测试多尺度损失，通过优化afCRPS进行训练。

Result: 多尺度损失有效约束小尺度变率，且未对预报技能产生负面影响。

Conclusion: 多尺度损失为未来尺度感知模型训练提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: We assess the impact of a multi-scale loss formulation for training
probabilistic machine-learned weather forecasting models. The multi-scale loss
is tested in AIFS-CRPS, a machine-learned weather forecasting model developed
at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). AIFS-CRPS is
trained by directly optimising the almost fair continuous ranked probability
score (afCRPS). The multi-scale loss better constrains small scale variability
without negatively impacting forecast skill. This opens up promising directions
for future work in scale-aware model training.

Motivation: 现有方法计算成本高或缺乏模拟罕见极端事件的能力，需要更高效的方法评估气候变暖下的极端天气风险。

Method: 利用可微分混合气候模型NeuralGCM，优化初始条件生成物理一致的最坏情况热浪轨迹。

Result: 应用于2021年西北太平洋热浪，温度异常比75成员集合中最极端成员高3.7°C，显示出大气阻塞和罗斯贝波模式的增强。

Conclusion: 可微分气候模型能高效探索极端事件的上限，为气候变化下的极端天气情景提供新方法。

Abstract: Understanding the plausible upper bounds of extreme weather events is
essential for risk assessment in a warming climate. Existing methods, based on
large ensembles of physics-based models, are often computationally expensive or
lack the fidelity needed to simulate rare, high-impact extremes. Here, we
present a novel framework that leverages a differentiable hybrid climate model,
NeuralGCM, to optimize initial conditions and generate physically consistent
worst-case heatwave trajectories. Applied to the 2021 Pacific Northwest
heatwave, our method produces temperature anomalies up to 3.7 $^\circ$C above
the most extreme member of a 75-member ensemble. These trajectories feature
intensified atmospheric blocking and amplified Rossby wave patterns--hallmarks
of severe heat events. Our results demonstrate that differentiable climate
models can efficiently explore the upper tails of event likelihoods, providing
a powerful new approach for constructing targeted storylines of extreme weather
under climate change.

### [1] [Prescriptive Agents based on Rag for Automated Maintenance (PARAM)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04714)
*Chitranshu Harbola,Anupam Purwar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）的智能系统，用于工业机械的预防性维护，结合振动频率分析和多代理生成技术，提供可操作的维护建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业机械维护需要及时干预以避免灾难性故障并优化运行效率，传统方法仅限于异常检测，缺乏具体维护建议。

Method: 系统将轴承振动数据（BPFO、BPFI、BSF、FTF频率）转换为自然语言供LLM处理，结合多代理组件分析维护手册和网络信息，生成结构化维护建议。

Result: 实验验证表明，系统能有效检测异常并提供上下文相关的维护指导，填补了状态监测与可操作维护计划之间的空白。

Conclusion: 该研究推动了LLM在工业维护中的应用，为跨机械组件和工业领域的预防性维护提供了可扩展框架。

Abstract: Industrial machinery maintenance requires timely intervention to prevent
catastrophic failures and optimize operational efficiency. This paper presents
an integrated Large Language Model (LLM)-based intelligent system for
prescriptive maintenance that extends beyond traditional anomaly detection to
provide actionable maintenance recommendations. Building upon our prior LAMP
framework for numerical data analysis, we develop a comprehensive solution that
combines bearing vibration frequency analysis with multi agentic generation for
intelligent maintenance planning. Our approach serializes bearing vibration
data (BPFO, BPFI, BSF, FTF frequencies) into natural language for LLM
processing, enabling few-shot anomaly detection with high accuracy. The system
classifies fault types (inner race, outer race, ball/roller, cage faults) and
assesses severity levels. A multi-agentic component processes maintenance
manuals using vector embeddings and semantic search, while also conducting web
searches to retrieve comprehensive procedural knowledge and access up-to-date
maintenance practices for more accurate and in-depth recommendations. The
Gemini model then generates structured maintenance recommendations includes
immediate actions, inspection checklists, corrective measures, parts
requirements, and timeline specifications. Experimental validation in bearing
vibration datasets demonstrates effective anomaly detection and contextually
relevant maintenance guidance. The system successfully bridges the gap between
condition monitoring and actionable maintenance planning, providing industrial
practitioners with intelligent decision support. This work advances the
application of LLMs in industrial maintenance, offering a scalable framework
for prescriptive maintenance across machinery components and industrial
sectors.

### [2] [GeoFlow: Agentic Workflow Automation for Geospatial Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04719)
*Amulya Bhattaram,Justin Chung,Stanley Chung,Ranit Gupta,Janani Ramamoorthy,Kartikeya Gullapalli,Diana Marculescu,Dimitrios Stamoulis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GeoFlow是一种自动生成地理空间任务代理工作流的方法，通过明确工具调用目标提升代理成功率并减少令牌使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在推理分解上较为模糊，且未明确API选择，GeoFlow旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 为每个代理提供详细的工具调用目标，指导运行时地理空间API的调用。

Result: GeoFlow将代理成功率提升6.8%，令牌使用量减少至四分之一。

Conclusion: GeoFlow通过明确工具调用目标，显著提升了代理性能和效率。

Abstract: We present GeoFlow, a method that automatically generates agentic workflows
for geospatial tasks. Unlike prior work that focuses on reasoning decomposition
and leaves API selection implicit, our method provides each agent with detailed
tool-calling objectives to guide geospatial API invocation at runtime. GeoFlow
increases agentic success by 6.8% and reduces token usage by up to fourfold
across major LLM families compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过对抗性棋盘游戏评估大型语言模型（LLM）性能的框架，弥补了主流问答基准的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用对抗性棋盘游戏作为战略推理和智能的典型领域，评估LLM的综合性能。

Method: 开发了Qi Town平台，支持5种游戏和20个LLM驱动的玩家，使用Elo评分系统和性能循环图（PLG）定量评估技术能力，并通过积极情绪评分（PSS）评估心理适应性。

Result: 实验表明，尽管技术差异显著，大多数LLM在对抗环境中表现出比人类更强的适应性和乐观态度，但PLG揭示了其技能发挥的不稳定性。

Conclusion: 该框架为LLM评估提供了新视角，揭示了其在对抗环境中的潜力和局限性，值得进一步研究。

Abstract: Adversarial board games, as a paradigmatic domain of strategic reasoning and
intelligence, have long served as both a popular competitive activity and a
benchmark for evaluating artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Building on this
foundation, we propose an adversarial benchmarking framework to assess the
comprehensive performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) through board games
competition, compensating the limitation of data dependency of the mainstream
Question-and-Answer (Q&A) based benchmark method. We introduce Qi Town, a
specialized evaluation platform that supports 5 widely played games and
involves 20 LLM-driven players. The platform employs both the Elo rating system
and a novel Performance Loop Graph (PLG) to quantitatively evaluate the
technical capabilities of LLMs, while also capturing Positive Sentiment Score
(PSS) throughout gameplay to assess mental fitness. The evaluation is
structured as a round-robin tournament, enabling systematic comparison across
players. Experimental results indicate that, despite technical differences,
most LLMs remain optimistic about winning and losing, demonstrating greater
adaptability to high-stress adversarial environments than humans. On the other
hand, the complex relationship between cyclic wins and losses in PLGs exposes
the instability of LLMs' skill play during games, warranting further
explanation and exploration.

### [4] [Fine-Tuning Small Language Models (SLMs) for Autonomous Web-based Geographical Information Systems (AWebGIS)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04846)
*Mahdi Nazari Ashani,Ali Asghar Alesheikh,Saba Kazemi,Kimya Kheirkhah,Yasin Mohammadi,Fatemeh Rezaie,Amir Mahdi Manafi,Hedieh Zarkesh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 比较了三种实现AWebGIS的方法，发现基于客户端小型语言模型（SLM）的方法在准确性和隐私保护上表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决云基础大型语言模型（LLM）在AWebGIS中依赖互联网、隐私和扩展性问题。

Method: 比较了三种方法：1）云基础LLM；2）半自动化离线方法；3）客户端SLM。

Result: 客户端SLM方法在准确性（0.93）和效率上表现最优，且减轻服务器负担。

Conclusion: 客户端SLM方法可行，为AWebGIS提供了高效、隐私保护的解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous web-based geographical information systems (AWebGIS) aim to
perform geospatial operations from natural language input, providing intuitive,
intelligent, and hands-free interaction. However, most current solutions rely
on cloud-based large language models (LLMs), which require continuous internet
access and raise users' privacy and scalability issues due to centralized
server processing. This study compares three approaches to enabling AWebGIS:
(1) a fully-automated online method using cloud-based LLMs (e.g., Cohere); (2)
a semi-automated offline method using classical machine learning classifiers
such as support vector machine and random forest; and (3) a fully autonomous
offline (client-side) method based on a fine-tuned small language model (SLM),
specifically T5-small model, executed in the client's web browser. The third
approach, which leverages SLMs, achieved the highest accuracy among all
methods, with an exact matching accuracy of 0.93, Levenshtein similarity of
0.99, and recall-oriented understudy for gisting evaluation ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-L
scores of 0.98. Crucially, this client-side computation strategy reduces the
load on backend servers by offloading processing to the user's device,
eliminating the need for server-based inference. These results highlight the
feasibility of browser-executable models for AWebGIS solutions.

*Huiya Zhao,Yinghao Zhu,Zixiang Wang,Yasha Wang,Junyi Gao,Liantao Ma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HealthFlow是一种自进化的AI代理，通过元级进化机制提升战略规划能力，显著优于现有框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI代理在医疗研究中依赖静态策略的局限性，提升战略规划能力。

Method: 引入HealthFlow，通过元级进化机制自主优化高层问题解决策略，并开发EHRFlowBench基准测试。

Result: 实验表明HealthFlow显著优于现有代理框架。

Conclusion: 该研究标志着从工具使用者向自进化任务管理者的转变，为更自主的AI科学发现铺路。

Abstract: The efficacy of AI agents in healthcare research is hindered by their
reliance on static, predefined strategies. This creates a critical limitation:
agents can become better tool-users but cannot learn to become better strategic
planners, a crucial skill for complex domains like healthcare. We introduce
HealthFlow, a self-evolving AI agent that overcomes this limitation through a
novel meta-level evolution mechanism. HealthFlow autonomously refines its own
high-level problem-solving policies by distilling procedural successes and
failures into a durable, strategic knowledge base. To anchor our research and
facilitate reproducible evaluation, we introduce EHRFlowBench, a new benchmark
featuring complex, realistic health data analysis tasks derived from
peer-reviewed clinical research. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
HealthFlow's self-evolving approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
agent frameworks. This work marks a necessary shift from building better
tool-users to designing smarter, self-evolving task-managers, paving the way
for more autonomous and effective AI for scientific discovery.

### [6] [Large Language Models Reasoning Abilities Under Non-Ideal Conditions After RL-Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04848)
*Chang Tian,Matthew B. Blaschko,Mingzhe Xing,Xiuxing Li,Yinliang Yue,Marie-Francine Moens*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 强化学习（RL）用于提升大语言模型（LLMs）的推理能力，但在非理想场景下表现显著下降。研究提出三种非理想场景并评估模型表现，发现当前方法未能有效解决推理缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试在理想化设置下评估LLMs的推理能力，忽视了非理想场景下的表现。研究旨在揭示RL在非理想场景中的局限性。

Method: 通过RL微调三种LLMs和一种大型视觉语言模型（LVLM），并在八种公共数据集上测试其在非理想场景（如摘要推理、细粒度噪声抑制和上下文过滤）中的表现。

Result: RL微调在理想化设置下提升推理能力，但在非理想场景中表现显著下降。提出的补救方法未能完全解决推理缺陷。

Conclusion: 大模型的推理能力被高估，需在非理想场景下评估模型表现。代码和数据将公开。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a key technique for enhancing the
reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), with policy-gradient
algorithms dominating the post-training stage because of their efficiency and
effectiveness. However, most existing benchmarks evaluate large-language-model
reasoning under idealized settings, overlooking performance in realistic,
non-ideal scenarios. We identify three representative non-ideal scenarios with
practical relevance: summary inference, fine-grained noise suppression, and
contextual filtering. We introduce a new research direction guided by
brain-science findings that human reasoning remains reliable under imperfect
inputs. We formally define and evaluate these challenging scenarios. We
fine-tune three LLMs and a state-of-the-art large vision-language model (LVLM)
using RL with a representative policy-gradient algorithm and then test their
performance on eight public datasets. Our results reveal that while RL
fine-tuning improves baseline reasoning under idealized settings, performance
declines significantly across all three non-ideal scenarios, exposing critical
limitations in advanced reasoning capabilities. Although we propose a
scenario-specific remediation method, our results suggest current methods leave
these reasoning deficits largely unresolved. This work highlights that the
reasoning abilities of large models are often overstated and underscores the
importance of evaluating models under non-ideal scenarios. The code and data
will be released at XXXX.

### [7] [Cognitive Duality for Adaptive Web Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05081)
*Jiarun Liu,Chunhong Zhang,Zheng Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合离线模仿学习和在线探索的Web导航智能体框架CogniWeb，受人类双系统认知理论启发，实现了高效且性能优越的解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Web导航是评估通用人工智能（AGI）的关键领域，但现有方法未能有效整合离线学习和在线探索。

Method: 受人类双系统认知理论启发，将智能体分解为快速直觉处理（System 1）和慢速深思熟虑（System 2），并在CogniWeb中实现这一框架。

Result: 在WebArena上的评估显示，CogniWeb实现了43.96%的成功率，同时显著提高了效率（减少75%的token使用）。

Conclusion: CogniWeb通过结合双系统认知理论，为Web导航智能体提供了高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: Web navigation represents a critical and challenging domain for evaluating
artificial general intelligence (AGI), demanding complex decision-making within
high-entropy, dynamic environments with combinatorially explosive action
spaces. Current approaches to building autonomous web agents either focus on
offline imitation learning or online exploration, but rarely integrate both
paradigms effectively. Inspired by the dual-process theory of human cognition,
we derive a principled decomposition into fast System 1 and slow System 2
cognitive processes. This decomposition provides a unifying perspective on
existing web agent methodologies, bridging the gap between offline learning of
intuitive reactive behaviors and online acquisition of deliberative planning
capabilities. We implement this framework in CogniWeb, a modular agent
architecture that adaptively toggles between fast intuitive processing and
deliberate reasoning based on task complexity. Our evaluation on WebArena
demonstrates that CogniWeb achieves competitive performance (43.96% success
rate) while maintaining significantly higher efficiency (75% reduction in token
usage).

### [8] [Beyond Automation: Socratic AI, Epistemic Agency, and the Implications of the Emergence of Orchestrated Multi-Agent Learning Architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05116)
*Peer-Benedikt Degen,Igor Asanov*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨生成式AI在高等教育中的角色转变，提出并验证了一种基于建构主义理论的苏格拉底式AI导师，证明其能显著提升学生的批判性思维和反思能力，同时提出了多代理系统（MAS）的概念及其在教育中的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究生成式AI如何从边缘工具转变为通用基础设施，重塑知识生成与验证方式，并探索其在教育中的潜力。

Method: 通过对照实验，比较65名德国师范生使用苏格拉底式AI导师与普通AI聊天机器人的效果。

Result: 使用苏格拉底式AI导师的学生在批判性、独立性和反思性思维方面表现显著更好。

Conclusion: 研究为混合学习生态系统提供了实证支持和概念框架，强调人机协作与教学一致性。

Abstract: Generative AI is no longer a peripheral tool in higher education. It is
rapidly evolving into a general-purpose infrastructure that reshapes how
knowledge is generated, mediated, and validated. This paper presents findings
from a controlled experiment evaluating a Socratic AI Tutor, a large language
model designed to scaffold student research question development through
structured dialogue grounded in constructivist theory. Conducted with 65
pre-service teacher students in Germany, the study compares interaction with
the Socratic Tutor to engagement with an uninstructed AI chatbot. Students
using the Socratic Tutor reported significantly greater support for critical,
independent, and reflective thinking, suggesting that dialogic AI can stimulate
metacognitive engagement and challenging recent narratives of de-skilling due
to generative AI usage. These findings serve as a proof of concept for a
broader pedagogical shift: the use of multi-agent systems (MAS) composed of
specialised AI agents. To conceptualise this, we introduce the notion of
orchestrated MAS, modular, pedagogically aligned agent constellations, curated
by educators, that support diverse learning trajectories through differentiated
roles and coordinated interaction. To anchor this shift, we propose an adapted
offer-and-use model, in which students appropriate instructional offers from
these agents. Beyond technical feasibility, we examine system-level
implications for higher education institutions and students, including funding
necessities, changes to faculty roles, curriculars, competencies and assessment
practices. We conclude with a comparative cost-effectiveness analysis
highlighting the scalability of such systems. In sum, this study contributes
both empirical evidence and a conceptual roadmap for hybrid learning ecosystems
that embed human-AI co-agency and pedagogical alignment.

### [9] [The Docking Game: Loop Self-Play for Fast, Dynamic, and Accurate Prediction of Flexible Protein--Ligand Binding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05006)
*Youzhi Zhang,Yufei Li,Gaofeng Meng,Hongbin Liu,Jiebo Luo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于博弈论的新型分子对接框架（Docking Game），通过LoopPlay算法显著提升了对接准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分子对接模型在配体对接中表现不佳，主要由于配体和蛋白质结构复杂性的差异。

Method: 将蛋白质-配体交互建模为双玩家博弈，开发LoopPlay算法，通过内外循环交替训练玩家模块。

Result: 在公开基准数据集上，LoopPlay比现有方法准确率提升约10%。

Conclusion: 该框架有望提高药物发现中分子对接的准确性。

Abstract: Molecular docking is a crucial aspect of drug discovery, as it predicts the
binding interactions between small-molecule ligands and protein pockets.
However, current multi-task learning models for docking often show inferior
performance in ligand docking compared to protein pocket docking. This
disparity arises largely due to the distinct structural complexities of ligands
and proteins. To address this issue, we propose a novel game-theoretic
framework that models the protein-ligand interaction as a two-player game
called the Docking Game, with the ligand docking module acting as the ligand
player and the protein pocket docking module as the protein player. To solve
this game, we develop a novel Loop Self-Play (LoopPlay) algorithm, which
alternately trains these players through a two-level loop. In the outer loop,
the players exchange predicted poses, allowing each to incorporate the other's
structural predictions, which fosters mutual adaptation over multiple
iterations. In the inner loop, each player dynamically refines its predictions
by incorporating its own predicted ligand or pocket poses back into its model.
We theoretically show the convergence of LoopPlay, ensuring stable
optimization. Extensive experiments conducted on public benchmark datasets
demonstrate that LoopPlay achieves approximately a 10\% improvement in
predicting accurate binding modes compared to previous state-of-the-art
methods. This highlights its potential to enhance the accuracy of molecular
docking in drug discovery.

### [10] [Can Large Language Models Integrate Spatial Data? Empirical Insights into Reasoning Strengths and Computational Weaknesses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05009)
*Bin Han,Robert Wolfe,Anat Caspi,Bill Howe*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了利用大语言模型（LLMs）整合城市空间数据的潜力，发现LLMs在空间推理方面存在局限，但结合特定特征后表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统规则方法和机器学习在整合异构、噪声空间数据时存在不足，LLMs提供了一种灵活替代方案。

Method: 研究LLMs的空间推理能力，并采用“审查-优化”方法修正错误响应。

Result: LLMs在特定条件下表现优异，但需依赖相关特征以减少空间推理需求。

Conclusion: LLMs是传统规则方法的有效替代，未来可探索多模态整合和多样化数据支持。

Abstract: We explore the application of large language models (LLMs) to empower domain
experts in integrating large, heterogeneous, and noisy urban spatial datasets.
Traditional rule-based integration methods are unable to cover all edge cases,
requiring manual verification and repair. Machine learning approaches require
collecting and labeling of large numbers of task-specific samples. In this
study, we investigate the potential of LLMs for spatial data integration. Our
analysis first considers how LLMs reason about environmental spatial
relationships mediated by human experience, such as between roads and
sidewalks. We show that while LLMs exhibit spatial reasoning capabilities, they
struggle to connect the macro-scale environment with the relevant computational
geometry tasks, often producing logically incoherent responses. But when
provided relevant features, thereby reducing dependence on spatial reasoning,
LLMs are able to generate high-performing results. We then adapt a
review-and-refine method, which proves remarkably effective in correcting
erroneous initial responses while preserving accurate responses. We discuss
practical implications of employing LLMs for spatial data integration in
real-world contexts and outline future research directions, including
post-training, multi-modal integration methods, and support for diverse data
formats. Our findings position LLMs as a promising and flexible alternative to
traditional rule-based heuristics, advancing the capabilities of adaptive
spatial data integration.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MedMKEB是首个针对医学多模态大语言模型知识编辑的系统性基准测试，评估可靠性、通用性、局部性、可移植性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学知识不断更新，需要高效编辑模型知识而无需从头训练，但目前缺乏多模态医学知识编辑的基准测试。

Method: 基于高质量医学视觉问答数据集构建MedMKEB，设计编辑任务（如反事实修正、语义泛化等），并引入专家验证。

Result: 实验显示现有知识编辑方法在医学领域存在局限性，需开发专门策略。

Conclusion: MedMKEB将推动可信赖且高效的医学知识编辑算法发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
significantly improved medical AI, enabling it to unify the understanding of
visual and textual information. However, as medical knowledge continues to
evolve, it is critical to allow these models to efficiently update outdated or
incorrect information without retraining from scratch. Although textual
knowledge editing has been widely studied, there is still a lack of systematic
benchmarks for multimodal medical knowledge editing involving image and text
modalities. To fill this gap, we present MedMKEB, the first comprehensive
benchmark designed to evaluate the reliability, generality, locality,
portability, and robustness of knowledge editing in medical multimodal large
language models. MedMKEB is built on a high-quality medical visual
question-answering dataset and enriched with carefully constructed editing
tasks, including counterfactual correction, semantic generalization, knowledge
transfer, and adversarial robustness. We incorporate human expert validation to
ensure the accuracy and reliability of the benchmark. Extensive single editing
and sequential editing experiments on state-of-the-art general and medical
MLLMs demonstrate the limitations of existing knowledge-based editing
approaches in medicine, highlighting the need to develop specialized editing
strategies. MedMKEB will serve as a standard benchmark to promote the
development of trustworthy and efficient medical knowledge editing algorithms.

### [12] [EasySize: Elastic Analog Circuit Sizing via LLM-Guided Heuristic Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05113)
*Xinyue Wu,Fan Hu,Shaik Jani Babu,Yi Zhao,Xinfei Guo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EasySize是一个基于Qwen3-8B模型的轻量级门尺寸优化框架，适用于不同工艺节点和电路拓扑，显著减少对人工经验和计算资源的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有AI方法在模拟电路门尺寸优化中通用性差、依赖大模型和跨工艺节点可移植性不足的问题。

Method: 结合微调的Qwen3-8B模型和动态任务特定损失函数，通过全局差分进化和局部粒子群优化进行启发式搜索。

Result: 在180nm、45nm和22nm工艺节点上表现优异，优于AutoCkt框架，减少86.67%的任务仿真资源。

Conclusion: EasySize能显著简化模拟电路设计流程，减少对人工和计算资源的依赖，未来将开源。

Abstract: Analog circuit design is a time-consuming, experience-driven task in chip
development. Despite advances in AI, developing universal, fast, and stable
gate sizing methods for analog circuits remains a significant challenge. Recent
approaches combine Large Language Models (LLMs) with heuristic search
techniques to enhance generalizability, but they often depend on large model
sizes and lack portability across different technology nodes. To overcome these
limitations, we propose EasySize, the first lightweight gate sizing framework
based on a finetuned Qwen3-8B model, designed for universal applicability
across process nodes, design specifications, and circuit topologies. EasySize
exploits the varying Ease of Attainability (EOA) of performance metrics to
dynamically construct task-specific loss functions, enabling efficient
heuristic search through global Differential Evolution (DE) and local Particle
Swarm Optimization (PSO) within a feedback-enhanced flow. Although finetuned
solely on 350nm node data, EasySize achieves strong performance on 5
operational amplifier (Op-Amp) netlists across 180nm, 45nm, and 22nm technology
nodes without additional targeted training, and outperforms AutoCkt, a
widely-used Reinforcement Learning based sizing framework, on 86.67\% of tasks
with more than 96.67\% of simulation resources reduction. We argue that
EasySize can significantly reduce the reliance on human expertise and
computational resources in gate sizing, thereby accelerating and simplifying
the analog circuit design process. EasySize will be open-sourced at a later
date.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于异构图神经网络（HGNN）的方法，用于修复流程挖掘中事件日志的缺失属性，相比现有方法表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的事件日志常因数据采集问题导致信息缺失，现有方法（如基于流程模型或机器学习）存在局限性，需要更自然且表达能力强的解决方案。

Method: 开发了一种异构图神经网络模型，能够处理不完整事件，并修复所有缺失属性。

Result: 在两个合成日志和四个真实日志上评估，该方法在修复所有事件属性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: HGNN模型在事件日志修复中具有显著优势，能够全面恢复缺失属性。

Abstract: The quality of event logs in Process Mining is crucial when applying any form
of analysis to them. In real-world event logs, the acquisition of data can be
non-trivial (e.g., due to the execution of manual activities and related manual
recording or to issues in collecting, for each event, all its attributes), and
often may end up with events recorded with some missing information. Standard
approaches to the problem of trace (or log) reconstruction either require the
availability of a process model that is used to fill missing values by
leveraging different reasoning techniques or employ a Machine Learning/Deep
Learning model to restore the missing values by learning from similar cases. In
recent years, a new type of Deep Learning model that is capable of handling
input data encoded as graphs has emerged, namely Graph Neural Networks. Graph
Neural Network models, and even more so Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks,
offer the advantage of working with a more natural representation of complex
multi-modal sequences like the execution traces in Process Mining, allowing for
more expressive and semantically rich encodings.
  In this work, we focus on the development of a Heterogeneous Graph Neural
Network model that, given a trace containing some incomplete events, will
return the full set of attributes missing from those events. We evaluate our
work against a state-of-the-art approach leveraging autoencoders on two
synthetic logs and four real event logs, on different types of missing values.
Different from state-of-the-art model-free approaches, which mainly focus on
repairing a subset of event attributes, the proposed approach shows very good
performance in reconstructing all different event attributes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG方法仅从文本或图像中检索，难以处理需要多跳推理或最新知识的复杂查询。

Method: QA-Dragon引入领域路由器和搜索路由器，动态选择检索策略，支持多模态、多轮和多跳推理。

Result: 在KDD Cup 2025的Meta CRAG-MM挑战中，QA-Dragon显著提升性能，单源任务提升5.06%，多源任务提升6.35%，多轮任务提升5.03%。

Conclusion: QA-Dragon通过动态检索策略和多模态协同，有效解决了复杂VQA任务中的知识检索和推理问题。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been introduced to mitigate
hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by incorporating
external knowledge into the generation process, and it has become a widely
adopted approach for knowledge-intensive Visual Question Answering (VQA).
However, existing RAG methods typically retrieve from either text or images in
isolation, limiting their ability to address complex queries that require
multi-hop reasoning or up-to-date factual knowledge. To address this
limitation, we propose QA-Dragon, a Query-Aware Dynamic RAG System for
Knowledge-Intensive VQA. Specifically, QA-Dragon introduces a domain router to
identify the query's subject domain for domain-specific reasoning, along with a
search router that dynamically selects optimal retrieval strategies. By
orchestrating both text and image search agents in a hybrid setup, our system
supports multimodal, multi-turn, and multi-hop reasoning, enabling it to tackle
complex VQA tasks effectively. We evaluate our QA-Dragon on the Meta CRAG-MM
Challenge at KDD Cup 2025, where it significantly enhances the reasoning
performance of base models under challenging scenarios. Our framework achieves
substantial improvements in both answer accuracy and knowledge overlap scores,
outperforming baselines by 5.06% on the single-source task, 6.35% on the
multi-source task, and 5.03% on the multi-turn task.

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合架构，将基于决策树的符号推理与大型语言模型（LLM）的生成能力结合，通过多智能体框架实现协调推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法中符号与神经模块松散耦合的问题，提供更统一、可解释的推理系统。

Method: 将决策树和随机森林作为可调用模块嵌入统一推理系统，LLM负责归纳推理和交互规划，中央协调器维护状态一致性。

Result: 在多个推理基准测试中表现优异，如ProofWriter（+7.2%）、GSM8k（+5.3%）和ARC（+6.0%）。

Conclusion: 该架构为通用神经符号推理提供了鲁棒、可解释且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a hybrid architecture that integrates decision tree-based symbolic
reasoning with the generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs)
within a coordinated multi-agent framework. Unlike prior approaches that
loosely couple symbolic and neural modules, our design embeds decision trees
and random forests as callable oracles within a unified reasoning system.
Tree-based modules enable interpretable rule inference and causal logic, while
LLM agents handle abductive reasoning, generalization, and interactive
planning. A central orchestrator maintains belief state consistency and
mediates communication across agents and external tools, enabling reasoning
over both structured and unstructured inputs.
  The system achieves strong performance on reasoning benchmarks. On
\textit{ProofWriter}, it improves entailment consistency by +7.2\% through
logic-grounded tree validation. On GSM8k, it achieves +5.3\% accuracy gains in
multistep mathematical problems via symbolic augmentation. On \textit{ARC}, it
boosts abstraction accuracy by +6.0\% through integration of symbolic oracles.
Applications in clinical decision support and scientific discovery show how the
system encodes domain rules symbolically while leveraging LLMs for contextual
inference and hypothesis generation. This architecture offers a robust,
interpretable, and extensible solution for general-purpose neuro-symbolic
reasoning.

Method: 通过历史分析和当代使用模式，提出一个多维框架，定义'agent'的最低要求，并探讨其实现挑战。

Result: 提出的框架为系统描述提供精确词汇，同时保留术语的多面性，并建议标准化术语和框架采用。

Conclusion: 该框架有助于提高研究清晰度和可重复性，支持更有效的政策制定。

Abstract: The term 'agent' in artificial intelligence has long carried multiple
interpretations across different subfields. Recent developments in AI
capabilities, particularly in large language model systems, have amplified this
ambiguity, creating significant challenges in research communication, system
evaluation and reproducibility, and policy development. This paper argues that
the term 'agent' requires redefinition. Drawing from historical analysis and
contemporary usage patterns, we propose a framework that defines clear minimum
requirements for a system to be considered an agent while characterizing
systems along a multidimensional spectrum of environmental interaction,
learning and adaptation, autonomy, goal complexity, and temporal coherence.
This approach provides precise vocabulary for system description while
preserving the term's historically multifaceted nature. After examining
potential counterarguments and implementation challenges, we provide specific
recommendations for moving forward as a field, including suggestions for
terminology standardization and framework adoption. The proposed approach
offers practical tools for improving research clarity and reproducibility while
supporting more effective policy development.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs的社会推理和说服能力，为未来AI系统在法律环境中的自主协商和立法设计提供了参考。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have extended their
capabilities from basic text processing to complex reasoning tasks, including
legal interpretation, argumentation, and strategic interaction. However,
empirical understanding of LLM behavior in open-ended, multi-agent settings
especially those involving deliberation over legal and ethical dilemmas remains
limited. We introduce NomicLaw, a structured multi-agent simulation where LLMs
engage in collaborative law-making, responding to complex legal vignettes by
proposing rules, justifying them, and voting on peer proposals. We
quantitatively measure trust and reciprocity via voting patterns and
qualitatively assess how agents use strategic language to justify proposals and
influence outcomes. Experiments involving homogeneous and heterogeneous LLM
groups demonstrate how agents spontaneously form alliances, betray trust, and
adapt their rhetoric to shape collective decisions. Our results highlight the
latent social reasoning and persuasive capabilities of ten open-source LLMs and
provide insights into the design of future AI systems capable of autonomous
negotiation, coordination and drafting legislation in legal settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Reasoning with minimal models has always been at the core of many knowledge
representation techniques, but we still have only a limited understanding of
this problem in Description Logics (DLs). Minimization of some selected
predicates, letting the remaining predicates vary or be fixed, as proposed in
circumscription, has been explored and exhibits high complexity. The case of
`pure' minimal models, where the extension of all predicates must be minimal,
has remained largely uncharted. We address this problem in popular DLs and
obtain surprisingly negative results: concept satisfiability in minimal models
is undecidable already for $\mathcal{EL}$. This undecidability also extends to
a very restricted fragment of tuple-generating dependencies. To regain
decidability, we impose acyclicity conditions on the TBox that bring the
worst-case complexity below double exponential time and allow us to establish a
connection with the recently studied pointwise circumscription; we also derive
results in data complexity. We conclude with a brief excursion to the DL-Lite
family, where a positive result was known for DL-Lite$_{\text{core}}$, but our
investigation establishes ExpSpace-hardness already for its extension
DL-Lite$_{\text{horn}}$.

TL;DR: StructVRM提出了一种结构化可验证奖励模型，用于解决多模态模型在复杂推理任务中部分正确性的问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统奖励机制仅提供整体二元评分，无法处理复杂多子问题的任务，限制了模型的学习效果。

Method: StructVRM通过训练模型验证器，提供细粒度的子问题级反馈，评估语义和数学等价性，而非严格的字符串匹配。

Result: Seed-StructVRM在12个多模态基准测试中的6个及新STEM-Bench上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: 结构化可验证奖励训练是提升多模态模型复杂推理能力的有效方法。

Abstract: Existing Vision-Language Models often struggle with complex, multi-question
reasoning tasks where partial correctness is crucial for effective learning.
Traditional reward mechanisms, which provide a single binary score for an
entire response, are too coarse to guide models through intricate problems with
multiple sub-parts. To address this, we introduce StructVRM, a method that
aligns multimodal reasoning with Structured and Verifiable Reward Models. At
its core is a model-based verifier trained to provide fine-grained,
sub-question-level feedback, assessing semantic and mathematical equivalence
rather than relying on rigid string matching. This allows for nuanced, partial
credit scoring in previously intractable problem formats. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of StructVRM. Our trained model, Seed-StructVRM,
achieves state-of-the-art performance on six out of twelve public multimodal
benchmarks and our newly curated, high-difficulty STEM-Bench. The success of
StructVRM validates that training with structured, verifiable rewards is a
highly effective approach for advancing the capabilities of multimodal models
in complex, real-world reasoning domains.

Result: 在Porto地铁数据集上实验，F-measure超过98%，准确率达99%，且在类不平衡和噪声下表现稳定。

Conclusion: 该方法具有实际应用价值，能有效支持铁路系统的主动维护决策，提升可靠性和安全性。

Abstract: This work contributes to a real-time data-driven predictive maintenance
solution for Intelligent Transportation Systems. The proposed method implements
a processing pipeline comprised of sample pre-processing, incremental
classification with Machine Learning models, and outcome explanation. This
novel online processing pipeline has two main highlights: (i) a dedicated
sample pre-processing module, which builds statistical and frequency-related
features on the fly, and (ii) an explainability module. This work is the first
to perform online fault prediction with natural language and visual
explainability. The experiments were performed with the MetroPT data set from
the metro operator of Porto, Portugal. The results are above 98 % for F-measure
and 99 % for accuracy. In the context of railway predictive maintenance,
achieving these high values is crucial due to the practical and operational
implications of accurate failure prediction. In the specific case of a high
F-measure, this ensures that the system maintains an optimal balance between
detecting the highest possible number of real faults and minimizing false
alarms, which is crucial for maximizing service availability. Furthermore, the
accuracy obtained enables reliability, directly impacting cost reduction and
increased safety. The analysis demonstrates that the pipeline maintains high
performance even in the presence of class imbalance and noise, and its
explanations effectively reflect the decision-making process. These findings
validate the methodological soundness of the approach and confirm its practical
applicability for supporting proactive maintenance decisions in real-world
railway operations. Therefore, by identifying the early signs of failure, this
pipeline enables decision-makers to understand the underlying problems and act
accordingly swiftly.

Motivation: VLMs在复杂动态环境中缺乏细节关注和精确动作规划能力，导致性能不佳，而现实任务需要高级空间推理和长期规划。

Method: 引入DeepPHY框架，通过多难度模拟环境和细粒度评估指标系统评估VLMs的物理推理能力。

Result: 评估显示，即使最先进的VLMs也难以将描述性物理知识转化为精确的预测控制。

Conclusion: DeepPHY为评估VLMs的物理推理能力提供了系统方法，揭示了现有模型的局限性。

Abstract: Although Vision Language Models (VLMs) exhibit strong perceptual abilities
and impressive visual reasoning, they struggle with attention to detail and
precise action planning in complex, dynamic environments, leading to subpar
performance. Real-world tasks typically require complex interactions, advanced
spatial reasoning, long-term planning, and continuous strategy refinement,
usually necessitating understanding the physics rules of the target scenario.
However, evaluating these capabilities in real-world scenarios is often
prohibitively expensive. To bridge this gap, we introduce DeepPHY, a novel
benchmark framework designed to systematically evaluate VLMs' understanding and
reasoning about fundamental physical principles through a series of challenging
simulated environments. DeepPHY integrates multiple physical reasoning
environments of varying difficulty levels and incorporates fine-grained
evaluation metrics. Our evaluation finds that even state-of-the-art VLMs
struggle to translate descriptive physical knowledge into precise, predictive
control.

speculative tools into practical lab partners. We show how coupling LLMs with
graph neural networks, quantum calculations and real-time spectroscopy shrinks
discovery cycles and supports greener, data-driven chemistry. We discuss
limitations, including biased datasets, opaque reasoning and the need for
safety gates that prevent unintentional hazards. Finally, we outline community
initiatives open benchmarks, federated learning and explainable interfaces that
aim to democratize access while keeping humans firmly in control. These
advances chart a path towards rapid, reliable and inclusive molecular

Conclusion: 论文呼吁开发时空感知的对齐方法，以适应不同地区的文化、政治和法律背景，确保AI系统的全球适用性和透明度。

Abstract: AI (super) alignment describes the challenge of ensuring (future) AI systems
behave in accordance with societal norms and goals. While a quickly evolving
literature is addressing biases and inequalities, the geographic variability of
alignment remains underexplored. Simply put, what is considered appropriate,
truthful, or legal can differ widely across regions due to cultural norms,
political realities, and legislation. Alignment measures applied to AI/ML
workflows can sometimes produce outcomes that diverge from statistical
realities, such as text-to-image models depicting balanced gender ratios in
company leadership despite existing imbalances. Crucially, some model outputs
are globally acceptable, while others, e.g., questions about Kashmir, depend on
knowing the user's location and their context. This geographic sensitivity is
not new. For instance, Google Maps renders Kashmir's borders differently based
on user location. What is new is the unprecedented scale and automation with
which AI now mediates knowledge, expresses opinions, and represents geographic
reality to millions of users worldwide, often with little transparency about
how context is managed. As we approach Agentic AI, the need for
spatio-temporally aware alignment, rather than one-size-fits-all approaches, is
increasingly urgent. This paper reviews key geographic research problems,
suggests topics for future work, and outlines methods for assessing alignment
sensitivity.

Method: 使用LLM-as-judge分析，将194,955个基准问题映射到欧盟AI法案的能力分类中。

Result: 发现评估生态严重偏向行为倾向（如幻觉倾向53.7%），而关键功能能力（如失控场景）几乎未被覆盖。

Conclusion: 研究为政策制定者和开发者提供了改进评估工具的关键依据，以促进更安全合规的AI。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of General Purpose AI (GPAI) models necessitates robust
evaluation frameworks, especially with emerging regulations like the EU AI Act
and its associated Code of Practice (CoP). Current AI evaluation practices
depend heavily on established benchmarks, but these tools were not designed to
measure the systemic risks that are the focus of the new regulatory landscape.
This research addresses the urgent need to quantify this "benchmark-regulation
gap." We introduce Bench-2-CoP, a novel, systematic framework that uses
validated LLM-as-judge analysis to map the coverage of 194,955 questions from
widely-used benchmarks against the EU AI Act's taxonomy of model capabilities
and propensities. Our findings reveal a profound misalignment: the evaluation
ecosystem is overwhelmingly focused on a narrow set of behavioral propensities,
such as "Tendency to hallucinate" (53.7% of the corpus) and "Discriminatory
bias" (28.9%), while critical functional capabilities are dangerously
neglected. Crucially, capabilities central to loss-of-control scenarios,
including evading human oversight, self-replication, and autonomous AI
development, receive zero coverage in the entire benchmark corpus. This
translates to a near-total evaluation gap for systemic risks like "Loss of
Control" (0.4% coverage) and "Cyber Offence" (0.8% coverage). This study
provides the first comprehensive, quantitative analysis of this gap, offering
critical insights for policymakers to refine the CoP and for developers to
build the next generation of evaluation tools, ultimately fostering safer and
more compliant AI.

Motivation: ERC数据稀缺且存在偏差，LLM虽强但成本高，需资源高效解决方案。

Method: 利用小型通用LLM生成6个新数据集，补充三大ERC基准，评估其对分类和标签不平衡的影响。

Result: 生成数据集显著提升ERC分类器性能，增强模型鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 小型LLM生成的数据集有效补充ERC任务，提升模型表现。

Abstract: Emotion recognition in conversations (ERC) focuses on identifying emotion
shifts within interactions, representing a significant step toward advancing
machine intelligence. However, ERC data remains scarce, and existing datasets
face numerous challenges due to their highly biased sources and the inherent
subjectivity of soft labels. Even though Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated their quality in many affective tasks, they are typically
expensive to train, and their application to ERC tasks--particularly in data
generation--remains limited. To address these challenges, we employ a small,
resource-efficient, and general-purpose LLM to synthesize ERC datasets with
diverse properties, supplementing the three most widely used ERC benchmarks. We
generate six novel datasets, with two tailored to enhance each benchmark. We
evaluate the utility of these datasets to (1) supplement existing datasets for
ERC classification, and (2) analyze the effects of label imbalance in ERC. Our
experimental results indicate that ERC classifier models trained on the
generated datasets exhibit strong robustness and consistently achieve
statistically significant performance improvements on existing ERC benchmarks.

Conclusion: 结合数据选择和全阶段后训练，InfiAlign提供了一种可扩展且数据高效的对齐大推理模型的实用方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive reasoning abilities on
a wide range of complex tasks. However, enhancing these capabilities through
post-training remains resource intensive, particularly in terms of data and
computational cost. Although recent efforts have sought to improve sample
efficiency through selective data curation, existing methods often rely on
heuristic or task-specific strategies that hinder scalability. In this work, we
introduce InfiAlign, a scalable and sample-efficient post-training framework
that integrates supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) to align LLMs for enhanced reasoning. At the core of
InfiAlign is a robust data selection pipeline that automatically curates
high-quality alignment data from open-source reasoning datasets using
multidimensional quality metrics. This pipeline enables significant performance
gains while drastically reducing data requirements and remains extensible to
new data sources. When applied to the Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Base model, our SFT model
achieves performance on par with DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, while using only
approximately 12% of the training data, and demonstrates strong generalization
across diverse reasoning tasks. Additional improvements are obtained through
the application of DPO, with particularly notable gains in mathematical
reasoning tasks. The model achieves an average improvement of 3.89% on AIME
24/25 benchmarks. Our results highlight the effectiveness of combining
principled data selection with full-stage post-training, offering a practical
solution for aligning large reasoning models in a scalable and data-efficient
manner. The model checkpoints are available at

Motivation: 现有RAG方法主要针对非结构化数据，处理结构化知识（如知识图谱）时表现不佳，且当前图谱检索方法难以同时捕捉整体结构和控制精度。

Conclusion: GRAIL通过交互式检索范式，显著提升了图谱检索的推理性能，为结构化知识处理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) integrated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) techniques have exhibited remarkable performance across a wide range of
domains. However, existing RAG approaches primarily operate on unstructured
data and demonstrate limited capability in handling structured knowledge such
as knowledge graphs. Meanwhile, current graph retrieval methods fundamentally
struggle to capture holistic graph structures while simultaneously facing
precision control challenges that manifest as either critical information gaps
or excessive redundant connections, collectively undermining reasoning
performance. To address this challenge, we propose GRAIL: Graph-Retrieval
Augmented Interactive Learning, a framework designed to interact with
large-scale graphs for retrieval-augmented reasoning. Specifically, GRAIL
integrates LLM-guided random exploration with path filtering to establish a
data synthesis pipeline, where a fine-grained reasoning trajectory is
automatically generated for each task. Based on the synthesized data, we then
employ a two-stage training process to learn a policy that dynamically decides
the optimal actions at each reasoning step. The overall objective of
precision-conciseness balance in graph retrieval is decoupled into fine-grained
process-supervised rewards to enhance data efficiency and training stability.
In practical deployment, GRAIL adopts an interactive retrieval paradigm,
enabling the model to autonomously explore graph paths while dynamically
balancing retrieval breadth and precision. Extensive experiments have shown
that GRAIL achieves an average accuracy improvement of 21.01% and F1
improvement of 22.43% on three knowledge graph question-answering datasets. Our

TL;DR: 提出了一种通用的、模块化的框架，用于评估代理任务完成情况，不依赖任务领域，通过分解任务和验证每个步骤来模拟人类评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法（如LLM-as-a-Judge）仅关注最终输出，忽略了逐步推理过程，而Agent-as-a-Judge系统通常局限于特定领域。

Method: 框架将任务分解为子任务，利用代理的输出和推理信息逐步验证，模块化设计并汇总结果生成最终评估。

Result: 在GAIA和BigCodeBench基准测试中，Judge Agent的任务成功预测与人类评估更接近，比GPT-4o基线分别提高了4.76%和10.52%的准确率。

Conclusion: 该通用评估框架具有潜力，能够更准确地评估代理任务完成情况。

Abstract: The increasing adoption of foundation models as agents across diverse domains
necessitates a robust evaluation framework. Current methods, such as
LLM-as-a-Judge, focus only on final outputs, overlooking the step-by-step
reasoning that drives agentic decision-making. Meanwhile, existing
Agent-as-a-Judge systems, where one agent evaluates another's task completion,
are typically designed for narrow, domain-specific settings. To address this
gap, we propose a generalizable, modular framework for evaluating agent task
completion independent of the task domain. The framework emulates human-like
evaluation by decomposing tasks into sub-tasks and validating each step using
available information, such as the agent's output and reasoning. Each module
contributes to a specific aspect of the evaluation process, and their outputs
are aggregated to produce a final verdict on task completion. We validate our
framework by evaluating the Magentic-One Actor Agent on two benchmarks, GAIA
and BigCodeBench. Our Judge Agent predicts task success with closer agreement
to human evaluations, achieving 4.76% and 10.52% higher alignment accuracy,
respectively, compared to the GPT-4o based LLM-as-a-Judge baseline. This
demonstrates the potential of our proposed general-purpose evaluation
framework.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LORI是一种基于AI的工具，用于从推荐信中自动评估申请者的领导能力，利用自然语言处理和大型语言模型（如RoBERTa和LLAMA），在测试数据中表现出高准确性和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推荐信（LORs）能提供标准化考试分数之外的信息，但人工审阅耗时耗力。研究旨在通过自动化工具支持招生委员会高效评估申请者的领导能力。

Method: 采用自然语言处理和大型语言模型（RoBERTa和LLAMA）分析推荐信，识别领导力相关属性（如团队合作、沟通、创新）。

Result: RoBERTa模型在测试数据中表现优异，加权F1分数为91.6%，精确率为92.4%，召回率为91.6%。

Conclusion: LORI工具在研究生招生中能高效、准确地评估领导能力，不仅优化流程，还提供更全面的候选人能力评估。

Abstract: Letters of recommendation (LORs) provide valuable insights into candidates'
capabilities and experiences beyond standardized test scores. However,
reviewing these text-heavy materials is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To
address this challenge and support the admission committee in providing
feedback for students' professional growth, our study introduces LORI: LOR
Insights, a novel AI-based detection tool for assessing leadership skills in
LORs submitted by online master's program applicants. By employing natural
language processing and leveraging large language models using RoBERTa and
LLAMA, we seek to identify leadership attributes such as teamwork,
communication, and innovation. Our latest RoBERTa model achieves a weighted F1
score of 91.6%, a precision of 92.4%, and a recall of 91.6%, showing a strong
level of consistency in our test data. With the growing importance of
leadership skills in the STEM sector, integrating LORI into the graduate
admissions process is crucial for accurately assessing applicants' leadership
capabilities. This approach not only streamlines the admissions process but
also automates and ensures a more comprehensive evaluation of candidates'
capabilities.

*Rui Lu,Jinhe Bi,Yunpu Ma,Feng Xiao,Yuntao Du,Yijun Tian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MV-Debate是一个多视角代理辩论框架，用于统一多模态有害内容检测，通过动态反思门控提升准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体中多模态内容的复杂性使得有害意图（如讽刺、仇恨言论或虚假信息）难以识别，需要跨模态分析和动态适应。

Method: MV-Debate整合四个互补的辩论代理（表面分析师、深度推理者、模态对比者和社会情境分析者），通过迭代辩论和反思门控优化检测结果。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上，MV-Debate显著优于单一模型和现有多代理辩论基线。

Conclusion: 多代理辩论框架在提升社交媒体有害意图检测的可靠性方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Social media has evolved into a complex multimodal environment where text,
images, and other signals interact to shape nuanced meanings, often concealing
harmful intent. Identifying such intent, whether sarcasm, hate speech, or
misinformation, remains challenging due to cross-modal contradictions, rapid
cultural shifts, and subtle pragmatic cues. To address these challenges, we
propose MV-Debate, a multi-view agent debate framework with dynamic reflection
gating for unified multimodal harmful content detection. MV-Debate assembles
four complementary debate agents, a surface analyst, a deep reasoner, a
modality contrast, and a social contextualist, to analyze content from diverse
interpretive perspectives. Through iterative debate and reflection, the agents
refine responses under a reflection-gain criterion, ensuring both accuracy and
efficiency. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that MV-Debate
significantly outperforms strong single-model and existing multi-agent debate
baselines. This work highlights the promise of multi-agent debate in advancing
reliable social intent detection in safety-critical online contexts.

### [32] [The Missing Reward: Active Inference in the Era of Experience](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05619)
*Bo Wen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出主动推理（AIF）为解决AI自主学习的瓶颈问题，减少对人类奖励工程的依赖，并填补当前AI系统的“自主性差距”。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI系统依赖大量高质量训练数据和人工设计的奖励函数，难以实现真正的自主学习，存在可扩展性挑战。

Method: 通过主动推理（AIF）替代外部奖励信号，利用自由能最小化的内在驱动力，结合大型语言模型作为生成世界模型。

Result: AIF框架能够使AI系统自主平衡探索与利用，高效学习并保持与人类价值观的一致性。

Conclusion: AIF为开发自主AI提供了一条可行路径，同时满足计算和物理约束。

Abstract: This paper argues that Active Inference (AIF) provides a crucial foundation
for developing autonomous AI agents capable of learning from experience without
continuous human reward engineering. As AI systems begin to exhaust
high-quality training data and rely on increasingly large human workforces for
reward design, the current paradigm faces significant scalability challenges
that could impede progress toward genuinely autonomous intelligence. The
proposal for an ``Era of Experience,'' where agents learn from self-generated
data, is a promising step forward. However, this vision still depends on
extensive human engineering of reward functions, effectively shifting the
bottleneck from data curation to reward curation. This highlights what we
identify as the \textbf{grounded-agency gap}: the inability of contemporary AI
systems to autonomously formulate, adapt, and pursue objectives in response to
changing circumstances. We propose that AIF can bridge this gap by replacing
external reward signals with an intrinsic drive to minimize free energy,
allowing agents to naturally balance exploration and exploitation through a
unified Bayesian objective. By integrating Large Language Models as generative
world models with AIF's principled decision-making framework, we can create
agents that learn efficiently from experience while remaining aligned with
human values. This synthesis offers a compelling path toward AI systems that
can develop autonomously while adhering to both computational and physical
constraints.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出LearnerAgent，一个基于大语言模型的多智能体框架，模拟真实教学环境，研究人类学习行为。通过心理特征构建学习者类型，分析其动态学习进展，发现不同类型学习者的认知和行为模式与其心理特征一致，并揭示了大语言模型的默认行为特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以捕捉学习动态或提供可解释性，因此需要一种新框架来模拟真实教学环境，研究人类学习行为。

Method: 引入LearnerAgent，基于大语言模型构建多智能体框架，设计心理特征学习者（如深度、表面、懒惰学习者）和无特征通用学习者，通过知识获取、策略选择、测试和互动跟踪学习进展。

Result: 1）深度学习者实现持续认知增长；2）学习者行为与心理特征一致；3）通用学习者自我效能感高；4）大语言模型默认行为为“勤奋但脆弱的表面学习者”。

Conclusion: LearnerAgent能有效模拟真实场景，揭示大语言模型行为特征，为心理学和智能系统研究提供新视角。

Abstract: Capturing human learning behavior based on deep learning methods has become a
major research focus in both psychology and intelligent systems. Recent
approaches rely on controlled experiments or rule-based models to explore
cognitive processes. However, they struggle to capture learning dynamics, track
progress over time, or provide explainability. To address these challenges, we
introduce LearnerAgent, a novel multi-agent framework based on Large Language
Models (LLMs) to simulate a realistic teaching environment. To explore
human-like learning dynamics, we construct learners with psychologically
grounded profiles-such as Deep, Surface, and Lazy-as well as a persona-free
General Learner to inspect the base LLM's default behavior. Through weekly
knowledge acquisition, monthly strategic choices, periodic tests, and peer
interaction, we can track the dynamic learning progress of individual learners
over a full-year journey. Our findings are fourfold: 1) Longitudinal analysis
reveals that only Deep Learner achieves sustained cognitive growth. Our
specially designed "trap questions" effectively diagnose Surface Learner's
shallow knowledge. 2) The behavioral and cognitive patterns of distinct
learners align closely with their psychological profiles. 3) Learners'
self-concept scores evolve realistically, with the General Learner developing
surprisingly high self-efficacy despite its cognitive limitations. 4)
Critically, the default profile of base LLM is a "diligent but brittle Surface
Learner"-an agent that mimics the behaviors of a good student but lacks true,
generalizable understanding. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that
LearnerAgent aligns well with real scenarios, yielding more insightful findings
about LLMs' behavior.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升对话转录的可读性和信息丰富性，通过添加说话者特征元数据标签（如年龄、性别、情感）。

Method: 结合冻结的音频基础模型（如Whisper或WavLM）和冻结的LLAMA语言模型，通过轻量级连接器桥接音频和语言表示，无需任务特定微调。

Result: 在说话者分析任务中表现优异，同时保持模块化和速度；LLAMA模型在某些场景下直接比较x-向量，实现了8.8%的等错误率。

Conclusion: 该方法通过冻结模型和轻量级连接器，实现了高效的说话者特征元数据添加，为对话转录后处理提供了新思路。

Abstract: In dialogue transcription pipelines, Large Language Models (LLMs) are
frequently employed in post-processing to improve grammar, punctuation, and
readability. We explore a complementary post-processing step: enriching
transcribed dialogues by adding metadata tags for speaker characteristics such
as age, gender, and emotion. Some of the tags are global to the entire
dialogue, while some are time-variant. Our approach couples frozen audio
foundation models, such as Whisper or WavLM, with a frozen LLAMA language model
to infer these speaker attributes, without requiring task-specific fine-tuning
of either model. Using lightweight, efficient connectors to bridge audio and
language representations, we achieve competitive performance on speaker
profiling tasks while preserving modularity and speed. Additionally, we
demonstrate that a frozen LLAMA model can compare x-vectors directly, achieving
an Equal Error Rate of 8.8% in some scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的BPE算法（Parity-aware BPE），旨在解决传统BPE算法在低资源语言中表现不佳的问题，通过平衡不同语言的压缩率，实现更公平的tokenization。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统BPE算法在低资源语言中表现不佳，导致tokenization结果不理想，加剧了语言间的计算和金融不平等。

Method: 提出Parity-aware BPE算法，在每一步合并时优先优化当前压缩率最差的语言，以牺牲少量全局压缩率为代价，实现跨语言公平性。

Result: 实验表明，Parity-aware BPE能显著平衡不同语言的token数量，对全局压缩率和下游任务的语言模型性能影响可忽略。

Conclusion: Parity-aware BPE是一种有效的改进方法，能够在不显著影响性能的情况下，提升低资源语言的tokenization公平性。

Abstract: Tokenization is the first -- and often least scrutinized -- step of most NLP
pipelines. Standard algorithms for learning tokenizers rely on frequency-based
objectives, which favor languages dominant in the training data and
consequently leave lower-resource languages with tokenizations that are
disproportionately longer, morphologically implausible, or even riddled with
<UNK> placeholders. This phenomenon ultimately amplifies computational and
financial inequalities between users from different language backgrounds. To
remedy this, we introduce Parity-aware Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), a variant of
the widely-used BPE algorithm. At every merge step, Parity-aware BPE maximizes
the compression gain of the currently worst-compressed language, trading a
small amount of global compression for cross-lingual parity. We find
empirically that Parity-aware BPE leads to more equitable token counts across
languages, with negligible impact on global compression rate and no substantial
effect on language-model performance in downstream tasks.

Motivation: 探索如何通过音高重音检测模块提升ASR系统的性能，尤其是在有限资源条件下。

Method: 提出了一种联合ASR和音高重音检测的模型，利用半监督语音表示。

Result: 音高重音检测的F1分数显著提升41%，ASR的WER在LibriSpeech上降低了28.3%。

Conclusion: 研究表明，扩展预训练语音模型以保留或重新学习重要的韵律线索（如音高重音）至关重要。

Abstract: We show the performance of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems that
use semi-supervised speech representations can be boosted by a complimentary
pitch accent detection module, by introducing a joint ASR and pitch accent
detection model. The pitch accent detection component of our model achieves a
significant improvement on the state-of-the-art for the task, closing the gap
in F1-score by 41%. Additionally, the ASR performance in joint training
decreases WER by 28.3% on LibriSpeech, under limited resource fine-tuning. With
these results, we show the importance of extending pretrained speech models to
retain or re-learn important prosodic cues such as pitch accent.

TL;DR: RCR-Router是一种模块化、角色感知的上下文路由框架，用于多代理LLM系统，旨在通过动态选择语义相关内存子集来提高协作效率，同时减少令牌消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有协调方案依赖静态或全上下文路由策略，导致令牌消耗过多、内存冗余且适应性差。

Method: RCR-Router通过轻量级评分策略动态选择内存子集，并迭代整合代理输出到共享内存中。

Result: 在三个多跳QA基准测试中，RCR-Router减少令牌使用（高达30%），同时保持或提高答案质量。

Conclusion: 结构化内存路由和输出感知评估对可扩展多代理LLM系统至关重要。

Abstract: Multi-agent large language model (LLM) systems have shown strong potential in
complex reasoning and collaborative decision-making tasks. However, most
existing coordination schemes rely on static or full-context routing
strategies, which lead to excessive token consumption, redundant memory
exposure, and limited adaptability across interaction rounds. We introduce
RCR-Router, a modular and role-aware context routing framework designed to
enable efficient, adaptive collaboration in multi-agent LLMs. To our knowledge,
this is the first routing approach that dynamically selects semantically
relevant memory subsets for each agent based on its role and task stage, while
adhering to a strict token budget. A lightweight scoring policy guides memory
selection, and agent outputs are iteratively integrated into a shared memory
store to facilitate progressive context refinement. To better evaluate model
behavior, we further propose an Answer Quality Score metric that captures
LLM-generated explanations beyond standard QA accuracy. Experiments on three
multi-hop QA benchmarks -- HotPotQA, MuSiQue, and 2WikiMultihop -- demonstrate
that RCR-Router reduces token usage (up to 30%) while improving or maintaining
answer quality. These results highlight the importance of structured memory
routing and output-aware evaluation in advancing scalable multi-agent LLM
systems.

Motivation: 研究大语言模型的人格稳定性，以评估其在安全部署中的行为一致性。

Method: 使用传统和LLM适应的人格测量工具，系统测试模型在不同条件下的响应变异性。

Result: 发现模型响应变异性高，干预措施可能增加不稳定性，人格对齐策略可能不足。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs缺乏行为一致性基础，人格对齐策略在安全关键应用中可能不适用。

Abstract: Large language models require consistent behavioral patterns for safe
deployment, yet their personality-like traits remain poorly understood. We
present PERSIST (PERsonality Stability in Synthetic Text), a comprehensive
evaluation framework testing 25+ open-source models (1B-671B parameters) across
500,000+ responses. Using traditional (BFI-44, SD3) and novel LLM-adapted
personality instruments, we systematically vary question order, paraphrasing,
personas, and reasoning modes. Our findings challenge fundamental deployment
assumptions: (1) Even 400B+ models exhibit substantial response variability (SD
> 0.4); (2) Minor prompt reordering alone shifts personality measurements by up
to 20%; (3) Interventions expected to stabilize behavior, such as
chain-of-thought reasoning, detailed personas instruction, inclusion of
conversation history, can paradoxically increase variability; (4) LLM-adapted
instruments show equal instability to human-centric versions, confirming
architectural rather than translational limitations. This persistent
instability across scales and mitigation strategies suggests current LLMs lack
the foundations for genuine behavioral consistency. For safety-critical
applications requiring predictable behavior, these findings indicate that
personality-based alignment strategies may be fundamentally inadequate.

Result: 模糊表达的回答平均评分低25.6%，基准有效识别模型特定偏见。

Conclusion: 该研究为检测和衡量AI系统中的语言歧视提供了基础框架，适用于自动化决策中的公平性问题。

Abstract: This paper introduces a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating how Large
Language Models (LLMs) respond to linguistic shibboleths: subtle linguistic
markers that can inadvertently reveal demographic attributes such as gender,
social class, or regional background. Through carefully constructed interview
simulations using 100 validated question-response pairs, we demonstrate how
LLMs systematically penalize certain linguistic patterns, particularly hedging
language, despite equivalent content quality. Our benchmark generates
controlled linguistic variations that isolate specific phenomena while
maintaining semantic equivalence, which enables the precise measurement of
demographic bias in automated evaluation systems. We validate our approach
along multiple linguistic dimensions, showing that hedged responses receive
25.6% lower ratings on average, and demonstrate the benchmark's effectiveness
in identifying model-specific biases. This work establishes a foundational
framework for detecting and measuring linguistic discrimination in AI systems,
with broad applications to fairness in automated decision-making contexts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉语言聚类的框架，用于更全面地评估视觉活动识别系统，解决了动词语义和图像解释的模糊性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准精确匹配评估方法无法捕捉动词语义和图像解释的模糊性，导致模型性能评估不完整。

Method: 提出了一种视觉语言聚类框架，构建动词意义聚类，以更全面地评估模型性能。

Result: 在imSitu数据集上，每张图像平均映射到2.8个意义聚类，每个聚类代表图像的不同视角。聚类评估方法比标准方法更符合人类判断。

Conclusion: 聚类评估方法提供了更细致的模型性能评估，更符合人类对图像动作的理解。

Abstract: Evaluating visual activity recognition systems is challenging due to inherent
ambiguities in verb semantics and image interpretation. When describing actions
in images, synonymous verbs can refer to the same event (e.g., brushing vs.
grooming), while different perspectives can lead to equally valid but distinct
verb choices (e.g., piloting vs. operating). Standard exact-match evaluation,
which relies on a single gold answer, fails to capture these ambiguities,
resulting in an incomplete assessment of model performance. To address this, we
propose a vision-language clustering framework that constructs verb sense
clusters, providing a more robust evaluation. Our analysis of the imSitu
dataset shows that each image maps to an average of 2.8 sense clusters, with
each cluster representing a distinct perspective of the image. We evaluate
multiple activity recognition models and compare our cluster-based evaluation
with standard evaluation methods. Additionally, our human alignment analysis
suggests that the cluster-based evaluation better aligns with human judgements,
offering a more nuanced assessment of model performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自杀事件中SDoH因素提取的挑战，如长尾分布、关键压力源分析和模型可解释性不足。

Method: 采用多阶段语言模型框架，与BioBERT、GPT-3.5-turbo和DeepSeek-R1对比，并通过用户研究评估解释效果。

Result: 框架在SDoH因素提取和相关上下文检索任务中表现更优，且小模型微调可降低成本。多阶段设计提高了可解释性。

Conclusion: 该方法提高了从非结构化文本中提取自杀相关SDoH的准确性和透明度，有助于早期风险识别和预防策略。

Abstract: Background: Understanding social determinants of health (SDoH) factors
contributing to suicide incidents is crucial for early intervention and
prevention. However, data-driven approaches to this goal face challenges such
as long-tailed factor distributions, analyzing pivotal stressors preceding
suicide incidents, and limited model explainability. Methods: We present a
multi-stage large language model framework to enhance SDoH factor extraction
from unstructured text. Our approach was compared to other state-of-the-art
language models (i.e., pre-trained BioBERT and GPT-3.5-turbo) and reasoning
models (i.e., DeepSeek-R1). We also evaluated how the model's explanations help
people annotate SDoH factors more quickly and accurately. The analysis included
both automated comparisons and a pilot user study. Results: We show that our
proposed framework demonstrated performance boosts in the overarching task of
extracting SDoH factors and in the finer-grained tasks of retrieving relevant
context. Additionally, we show that fine-tuning a smaller, task-specific model
achieves comparable or better performance with reduced inference costs. The
multi-stage design not only enhances extraction but also provides intermediate
explanations, improving model explainability. Conclusions: Our approach
improves both the accuracy and transparency of extracting suicide-related SDoH
from unstructured texts. These advancements have the potential to support early
identification of individuals at risk and inform more effective prevention
strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法假设情感元素均匀分布，但实际对话中存在多个语义独立的子对话，跨对话学习会引入噪声。

Method: 利用结构熵最小化算法划分对话为语义独立的子对话，采用两步框架（先提取情感元素，后匹配四元组）。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在DiaASQ任务中达到最优性能且计算成本更低。

Conclusion: 通过语义子对话划分和两步提取框架，有效解决了噪声问题并提升了性能。

Abstract: Dialogues Aspect-based Sentiment Quadruple Extraction (DiaASQ) aims to
extract all target-aspect-opinion-sentiment quadruples from a given
multi-round, multi-participant dialogue. Existing methods typically learn word
relations across entire dialogues, assuming a uniform distribution of sentiment
elements. However, we find that dialogues often contain multiple semantically
independent sub-dialogues without clear dependencies between them. Therefore,
learning word relationships across the entire dialogue inevitably introduces
additional noise into the extraction process. To address this, our method
focuses on partitioning dialogues into semantically independent sub-dialogues.
Achieving completeness while minimizing these sub-dialogues presents a
significant challenge. Simply partitioning based on reply relationships is
ineffective. Instead, we propose utilizing a structural entropy minimization
algorithm to partition the dialogues. This approach aims to preserve relevant
utterances while distinguishing irrelevant ones as much as possible.
Furthermore, we introduce a two-step framework for quadruple extraction: first
extracting individual sentiment elements at the utterance level, then matching
quadruples at the sub-dialogue level. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in DiaASQ with much lower
computational costs.

Abstract: Meaning Representation (AMR) is a semantic formalism that encodes sentence
meaning as rooted, directed, acyclic graphs, where nodes represent concepts and
edges denote semantic relations. Finetuning decoder only Large Language Models
(LLMs) represent a promising novel straightfoward direction for AMR parsing.
This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of finetuning four distinct LLM

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文挑战了多任务学习中多适配器或多头的趋势，提出简化多头架构或单适配器LoRA也能高效完成任务，并提出Align-LoRA通过对齐任务表征进一步提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务学习中，当前方法倾向于使用多适配器或多头结构以捕捉任务特定知识，但作者发现这种复杂性可能并非必要。

Method: 提出简化多头架构和单适配器LoRA，并进一步设计Align-LoRA，通过显式损失对齐任务表征。

Result: 简化架构和单适配器LoRA表现优异，Align-LoRA显著超越基线方法。

Conclusion: 多任务学习的关键在于学习共享表征而非任务特定特征，Align-LoRA为LLM适应多任务提供了更简单有效的范式。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) is essential for adapting Large
Language Models (LLMs). In practice, LLMs are often required to handle a
diverse set of tasks from multiple domains, a scenario naturally addressed by
multi-task learning (MTL). Within this MTL context, a prevailing trend involves
LoRA variants with multiple adapters or heads, which advocate for structural
diversity to capture task-specific knowledge. Our findings present a direct
challenge to this paradigm. We first show that a simplified multi-head
architecture with high inter-head similarity substantially outperforms complex
multi-adapter and multi-head systems. This leads us to question the
multi-component paradigm itself, and we further demonstrate that a standard
single-adapter LoRA, with a sufficiently increased rank, also achieves highly
competitive performance. These results lead us to a new hypothesis: effective
MTL generalization hinges on learning robust shared representations, not
isolating task-specific features. To validate this, we propose Align-LoRA,
which incorporates an explicit loss to align task representations within the
shared adapter space. Experiments confirm that Align-LoRA significantly
surpasses all baselines, establishing a simpler yet more effective paradigm for
adapting LLMs to multiple tasks. The code is available at

Conclusion: 多模态显式推理的有效性展示了该方法在复杂现实场景中可扩展和可解释的事实核查潜力。

Abstract: The growing rate of multimodal misinformation, where claims are supported by
both text and images, poses significant challenges to fact-checking systems
that rely primarily on textual evidence. In this work, we have proposed a
unified framework for fine-grained multimodal fact verification called
"MultiCheck", designed to reason over structured textual and visual signals.
Our architecture combines dedicated encoders for text and images with a fusion
module that captures cross-modal relationships using element-wise interactions.
A classification head then predicts the veracity of a claim, supported by a
contrastive learning objective that encourages semantic alignment between
claim-evidence pairs in a shared latent space. We evaluate our approach on the
Factify 2 dataset, achieving a weighted F1 score of 0.84, substantially
outperforming the baseline. These results highlight the effectiveness of
explicit multimodal reasoning and demonstrate the potential of our approach for
scalable and interpretable fact-checking in complex, real-world scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的知识局限性促使检索增强生成（RAG）成为关键方法，但长检索上下文会导致熵增长和注意力稀释，影响性能。

Method: 提出BEE-RAG框架，利用平衡上下文熵重新定义注意力动态，实现熵不变性；引入零样本推理策略和多重要性估计，以及参数高效的自适应微调机制。

Result: 在多个RAG任务上的实验验证了BEE-RAG的有效性。

Conclusion: BEE-RAG通过熵工程和自适应机制显著提升了RAG系统的性能，适应不同上下文长度。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs),
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a critical approach to
supplement the inherent knowledge limitations of LLMs. However, due to the
typically large volume of retrieved information, RAG tends to operate with long
context lengths. From the perspective of entropy engineering, we identify
unconstrained entropy growth and attention dilution due to long retrieval
context as significant factors affecting RAG performance. In this paper, we
propose the balanced entropy-engineered RAG (BEE-RAG) framework, which improves
the adaptability of RAG systems to varying context lengths through the
principle of entropy invariance. By leveraging balanced context entropy to
reformulate attention dynamics, BEE-RAG separates attention sensitivity from
context length, ensuring a stable entropy level. Building upon this, we
introduce a zero-shot inference strategy for multi-importance estimation and a
parameter-efficient adaptive fine-tuning mechanism to obtain the optimal
balancing factor for different settings. Extensive experiments across multiple
RAG tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of BEE-RAG.

Motivation: 研究LLMs对输入信息位置的敏感性及其对性能的影响，旨在优化模型对关键信息的注意力分配。

Method: 提出AttnRank框架，通过校准集估计模型的注意力偏好，并重新排序输入内容以匹配高注意力位置。

Result: 在多项任务中，AttnRank显著提升了10种不同架构和规模的LLMs的性能。

Conclusion: AttnRank是一种高效、无需训练的方法，能有效优化LLMs的注意力分配，提升性能。

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is significantly sensitive to
the contextual position of information in the input. To investigate the
mechanism behind this positional bias, our extensive experiments reveal a
consistent phenomenon we term the attention basin: when presented with a
sequence of structured items (e.g., retrieved documents or few-shot examples),
models systematically assign higher attention to the items at the beginning and
end of the sequence, while neglecting those in the middle. Crucially, our
analysis further reveals that allocating higher attention to critical
information is key to enhancing model performance. Based on these insights, we
introduce Attention-Driven Reranking (AttnRank), a two-stage framework that (i)
estimates a model's intrinsic positional attention preferences using a small
calibration set, and (ii) reorders retrieved documents or few-shot examples to
align the most salient content with these high-attention positions. AttnRank is
a model-agnostic, training-free, and plug-and-play method with minimal
computational overhead. Experiments on multi-hop QA and few-shot in-context
learning tasks demonstrate that AttnRank achieves substantial improvements
across 10 large language models of varying architectures and scales, without
modifying model parameters or training procedures.

Abstract: The integration of large language models into healthcare necessitates a
rigorous evaluation of their ethical reasoning, an area current benchmarks
often overlook. We introduce PrinciplismQA, a comprehensive benchmark with
3,648 questions designed to systematically assess LLMs' alignment with core
medical ethics. Grounded in Principlism, our benchmark features a high-quality
dataset. This includes multiple-choice questions curated from authoritative
textbooks and open-ended questions sourced from authoritative medical ethics
case study literature, all validated by medical experts. Our experiments reveal
a significant gap between models' ethical knowledge and their practical
application, especially in dynamically applying ethical principles to
real-world scenarios. Most LLMs struggle with dilemmas concerning Beneficence,
often over-emphasizing other principles. Frontier closed-source models, driven
by strong general capabilities, currently lead the benchmark. Notably, medical
domain fine-tuning can enhance models' overall ethical competence, but further
progress requires better alignment with medical ethical knowledge.
PrinciplismQA offers a scalable framework to diagnose these specific ethical
weaknesses, paving the way for more balanced and responsible medical AI.

Abstract: The surge in rich multimodal content on social media platforms has greatly
advanced Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA), with Large Language Models (LLMs)
further accelerating progress in this field. Current approaches primarily
leverage the knowledge and reasoning capabilities of parameter-heavy
(Multimodal) LLMs for sentiment classification, overlooking autonomous
multimodal sentiment reasoning generation in resource-constrained environments.
Therefore, we focus on the Resource-Limited Joint Multimodal Sentiment
Reasoning and Classification task, JMSRC, which simultaneously performs
multimodal sentiment reasoning chain generation and sentiment classification
only with a lightweight model. We propose a Multimodal Chain-of-Thought
Reasoning Distillation model, MulCoT-RD, designed for JMSRC that employs a
"Teacher-Assistant-Student" distillation paradigm to address deployment
constraints in resource-limited environments. We first leverage a
high-performance Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to generate the initial
reasoning dataset and train a medium-sized assistant model with a multi-task
learning mechanism. A lightweight student model is jointly trained to perform
efficient multimodal sentiment reasoning generation and classification.
Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that MulCoT-RD with only 3B
parameters achieves strong performance on JMSRC, while exhibiting robust
generalization and enhanced interpretability.

Conclusion: 该方法通过保留功能网络提升了剪枝性能，为大型语言模型压缩提供了新思路。

Abstract: Structured pruning is one of the representative techniques for compressing
large language models (LLMs) to reduce GPU memory consumption and accelerate
inference speed. It offers significant practical value in improving the
efficiency of LLMs in real-world applications. Current structured pruning
methods typically rely on assessment of the importance of the structure units
and pruning the units with less importance. Most of them overlooks the
interaction and collaboration among artificial neurons that are crucial for the
functionalities of LLMs, leading to a disruption in the macro functional
architecture of LLMs and consequently a pruning performance degradation.
Inspired by the inherent similarities between artificial neural networks and
functional neural networks in the human brain, we alleviate this challenge and
propose to prune LLMs by identifying and preserving functional networks within
LLMs in this study. To achieve this, we treat an LLM as a digital brain and
decompose the LLM into functional networks, analogous to identifying functional
brain networks in neuroimaging data. Afterwards, an LLM is pruned by preserving
the key neurons within these functional networks. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method can successfully identify and locate
functional networks and key neurons in LLMs, enabling efficient model pruning.

Method: CodeBoost包含最大团选择、双向预测、错误感知预测、异构增强和异构奖励五个关键组件。

Result: 实验表明，CodeBoost能持续提升多种代码LLM的性能。

Conclusion: CodeBoost是一种可扩展且高效的训练框架。

Abstract: Code large language models (LLMs) have become indispensable tools for
building efficient and automated coding pipelines. Existing models are
typically post-trained using reinforcement learning (RL) from general-purpose
LLMs using "human instruction-final answer" pairs, where the instructions are
usually from manual annotations. However, collecting high-quality coding
instructions is both labor-intensive and difficult to scale. On the other hand,
code snippets are abundantly available from various sources. This imbalance
presents a major bottleneck in instruction-based post-training. We propose
CodeBoost, a post-training framework that enhances code LLMs purely from code
snippets, without relying on human-annotated instructions. CodeBoost introduces
the following key components: (1) maximum-clique curation, which selects a
representative and diverse training corpus from code; (2) bi-directional
prediction, which enables the model to learn from both forward and backward
prediction objectives; (3) error-aware prediction, which incorporates learning
signals from both correct and incorrect outputs; (4) heterogeneous
augmentation, which diversifies the training distribution to enrich code
semantics; and (5) heterogeneous rewarding, which guides model learning through
multiple reward types including format correctness and execution feedback from
both successes and failures. Extensive experiments across several code LLMs and
benchmarks verify that CodeBoost consistently improves performance,
demonstrating its effectiveness as a scalable and effective training pipeline.

Method: 通过系统性错误注入实验验证"晚期脆弱性"现象，并提出ASCoT方法，包括自适应验证管理器（AVM）和多视角自校正引擎（MSCE）。

Result: ASCoT在GSM8K和MATH基准测试中表现优异，超越标准CoT方法。

Conclusion: 强调诊断LLM推理特定失败模式的重要性，提倡转向自适应、针对脆弱性的校正机制。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has significantly advanced the reasoning
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the reliability of these
reasoning chains remains a critical challenge. A widely held "cascading
failure" hypothesis suggests that errors are most detrimental when they occur
early in the reasoning process. This paper challenges that assumption through
systematic error-injection experiments, revealing a counter-intuitive
phenomenon we term "Late-Stage Fragility": errors introduced in the later
stages of a CoT chain are significantly more likely to corrupt the final answer
than identical errors made at the beginning. To address this specific
vulnerability, we introduce the Adaptive Self-Correction Chain-of-Thought
(ASCoT) method. ASCoT employs a modular pipeline in which an Adaptive
Verification Manager (AVM) operates first, followed by the Multi-Perspective
Self-Correction Engine (MSCE). The AVM leverages a Positional Impact Score
function I(k) that assigns different weights based on the position within the
reasoning chains, addressing the Late-Stage Fragility issue by identifying and
prioritizing high-risk, late-stage steps. Once these critical steps are
identified, the MSCE applies robust, dual-path correction specifically to the
failure parts. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as GSM8K and MATH
demonstrate that ASCoT achieves outstanding accuracy, outperforming strong
baselines, including standard CoT. Our work underscores the importance of
diagnosing specific failure modes in LLM reasoning and advocates for a shift
from uniform verification strategies to adaptive, vulnerability-aware
correction mechanisms.

Abstract: Meta-reviewing is a pivotal stage in the peer-review process, serving as the
final step in determining whether a paper is recommended for acceptance. Prior
research on meta-reviewing has treated this as a summarization problem over
review reports. However, complementary to this perspective, meta-reviewing is a
decision-making process that requires weighing reviewer arguments and placing
them within a broader context. Prior research has demonstrated that
decision-makers can be effectively assisted in such scenarios via dialogue
agents. In line with this framing, we explore the practical challenges for
realizing dialog agents that can effectively assist meta-reviewers. Concretely,
we first address the issue of data scarcity for training dialogue agents by
generating synthetic data using Large Language Models (LLMs) based on a
self-refinement strategy to improve the relevance of these dialogues to expert
domains. Our experiments demonstrate that this method produces higher-quality
synthetic data and can serve as a valuable resource towards training
meta-reviewing assistants. Subsequently, we utilize this data to train dialogue
agents tailored for meta-reviewing and find that these agents outperform
\emph{off-the-shelf} LLM-based assistants for this task. Finally, we apply our
agents in real-world meta-reviewing scenarios and confirm their effectiveness
in enhancing the efficiency of meta-reviewing.\footnote{Code and Data:

that "thinks" in the same continuous SONAR embedding space, yet is supervised
through token-level cross-entropy propagated via the frozen SONAR decoder. This
hybrid objective retains the semantic abstraction of LCM while eliminating its
diffusion sampler and restoring a likelihood-based training signal. Across

Method: 提出CGRS方法，动态抑制模型在高置信度时的反射触发，无需重新训练或修改架构。

Result: 在四个推理基准测试中，CGRS平均减少18.5%至41.9%的token使用量，同时保持准确性。

Conclusion: CGRS在高效推理中具有实用价值，适用于不同架构和规模的模型。

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Language Models (LRLMs) employ long chain-of-thought
reasoning with complex reflection behaviors, typically signaled by specific
trigger words (e.g., "Wait" and "Alternatively") to enhance performance.
However, these reflection behaviors can lead to the overthinking problem where
the generation of redundant reasoning steps that unnecessarily increase token
usage, raise inference costs, and reduce practical utility. In this paper, we
propose Certainty-Guided Reflection Suppression (CGRS), a novel method that
mitigates overthinking in LRLMs while maintaining reasoning accuracy. CGRS
operates by dynamically suppressing the model's generation of reflection
triggers when it exhibits high confidence in its current response, thereby
preventing redundant reflection cycles without compromising output quality. Our
approach is model-agnostic, requires no retraining or architectural
modifications, and can be integrated seamlessly with existing autoregressive
generation pipelines. Extensive experiments across four reasoning benchmarks
(i.e., AIME24, AMC23, MATH500, and GPQA-D) demonstrate CGRS's effectiveness: it
reduces token usage by an average of 18.5% to 41.9% while preserving accuracy.
It also achieves the optimal balance between length reduction and performance
compared to state-of-the-art baselines. These results hold consistently across
model architectures (e.g., DeepSeek-R1-Distill series, QwQ-32B, and Qwen3
family) and scales (4B to 32B parameters), highlighting CGRS's practical value
for efficient reasoning.

Conclusion: 个性化不足以保证手语虚拟形象的可理解性，需改进动画质量和交互界面，并采用参与式设计。

Abstract: This paper presents an investigation into the impact of adding adjustment
features to an existing sign language (SL) avatar on a Microsoft Hololens 2
device. Through a detailed analysis of interactions of expert German Sign
Language (DGS) users with both adjustable and non-adjustable avatars in a
specific use case, this study identifies the key factors influencing the
comprehensibility, the user experience (UX), and the acceptability of such a
system. Despite user preference for adjustable settings, no significant
improvements in UX or comprehensibility were observed, which remained at low
levels, amid missing SL elements (mouthings and facial expressions) and
implementation issues (indistinct hand shapes, lack of feedback and menu
positioning). Hedonic quality was rated higher than pragmatic quality,
indicating that users found the system more emotionally or aesthetically
pleasing than functionally useful. Stress levels were higher for the adjustable
avatar, reflecting lower performance, greater effort and more frustration.
Additionally, concerns were raised about whether the Hololens adjustment
gestures are intuitive and easy to familiarise oneself with. While
acceptability of the concept of adjustability was generally positive, it was
strongly dependent on usability and animation quality. This study highlights
that personalisation alone is insufficient, and that SL avatars must be
comprehensible by default. Key recommendations include enhancing mouthing and
facial animation, improving interaction interfaces, and applying participatory
design.

information needs. Professional search tasks often demand high levels of user
expertise and transparency. The BioASQ CLEF 2025 challenge, using
expert-formulated questions, can serve as a platform to study these issues. We
explored the performance of current reasoning and nonreasoning LLMs like
Gemini-Flash 2.0, o3-mini, o4-mini and DeepSeek-R1. A key aspect of our
methodology was a self-feedback mechanism where LLMs generated, evaluated, and
then refined their outputs for query expansion and for multiple answer types
(yes/no, factoid, list, ideal). We investigated whether this iterative
self-correction improves performance and if reasoning models are more capable
of generating useful feedback. Preliminary results indicate varied performance
for the self-feedback strategy across models and tasks. This work offers
insights into LLM self-correction and informs future work on comparing the
effectiveness of LLM-generated feedback with direct human expert input in these
search systems.

TL;DR: MyCulture是一个评估LLMs在马来西亚文化理解上的新基准，采用开放式多选题形式以减少猜测和格式偏见，揭示LLMs在文化理解上的显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs因训练数据偏向高资源语言（如英语和中文）导致的文化偏见问题，特别是在低资源语言环境下。

Method: 设计MyCulture基准，涵盖马来西亚文化的六个方面，采用开放式多选题格式，分析结构和语言偏见。

Result: 评估显示LLMs在文化理解上存在显著差异，突显了文化基础和语言包容性基准的必要性。

Conclusion: MyCulture为LLMs的文化评估提供了更公平和区分力强的工具，强调了文化多样性和语言包容性的重要性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit cultural biases due to training
data dominated by high-resource languages like English and Chinese. This poses
challenges for accurately representing and evaluating diverse cultural
contexts, particularly in low-resource language settings. To address this, we
introduce MyCulture, a benchmark designed to comprehensively evaluate LLMs on
Malaysian culture across six pillars: arts, attire, customs, entertainment,
food, and religion presented in Bahasa Melayu. Unlike conventional benchmarks,
MyCulture employs a novel open-ended multiple-choice question format without
predefined options, thereby reducing guessing and mitigating format bias. We
provide a theoretical justification for the effectiveness of this open-ended
structure in improving both fairness and discriminative power. Furthermore, we
analyze structural bias by comparing model performance on structured versus
free-form outputs, and assess language bias through multilingual prompt
variations. Our evaluation across a range of regional and international LLMs
reveals significant disparities in cultural comprehension, highlighting the
urgent need for culturally grounded and linguistically inclusive benchmarks in
the development and assessment of LLMs.

Abstract: Existing evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) on static benchmarks is
vulnerable to data contamination and leaderboard overfitting, critical issues
that obscure true model capabilities. To address this, we introduce LLMEval-3,
a framework for dynamic evaluation of LLMs. LLMEval-3 is built on a proprietary
bank of 220k graduate-level questions, from which it dynamically samples unseen
test sets for each evaluation run. Its automated pipeline ensures integrity via
contamination-resistant data curation, a novel anti-cheating architecture, and
a calibrated LLM-as-a-judge process achieving 90% agreement with human experts,
complemented by a relative ranking system for fair comparison. An 20-month
longitudinal study of nearly 50 leading models reveals a performance ceiling on
knowledge memorization and exposes data contamination vulnerabilities
undetectable by static benchmarks. The framework demonstrates exceptional
robustness in ranking stability and consistency, providing strong empirical
validation for the dynamic evaluation paradigm. LLMEval-3 offers a robust and
credible methodology for assessing the true capabilities of LLMs beyond
leaderboard scores, promoting the development of more trustworthy evaluation
standards.

Motivation: 大语言模型在高层次语义任务上表现优异，但在需要精确控制的细粒度任务上存在不足，TASE旨在填补这一评估空白。

Method: TASE包含35,927个实例的评估集和可扩展的合成数据生成管道，涵盖中英韩三种语言，测试标记感知和结构理解能力。

Result: 评估30多个主流模型后，发现人类表现远超模型，尤其在标记级推理任务上。

Conclusion: TASE揭示了当前模型的局限性，为未来低层次语言理解和跨语言泛化改进提供了诊断工具。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance
on high-level semantic tasks, they often struggle with fine-grained,
token-level understanding and structural reasoning--capabilities that are
essential for applications requiring precision and control. We introduce TASE,
a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' ability to perceive and
reason about token-level information across languages. TASE covers 10 tasks
under two core categories: token awareness and structural understanding,
spanning Chinese, English, and Korean, with a 35,927-instance evaluation set
and a scalable synthetic data generation pipeline for training. Tasks include
character counting, token alignment, syntactic structure parsing, and length
constraint satisfaction. We evaluate over 30 leading commercial and open-source
LLMs, including O3, Claude 4, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and DeepSeek-R1, and train a
custom Qwen2.5-14B model using the GRPO training method. Results show that
human performance significantly outpaces current LLMs, revealing persistent
weaknesses in token-level reasoning. TASE sheds light on these limitations and
provides a new diagnostic lens for future improvements in low-level language
understanding and cross-lingual generalization. Our code and dataset are

Abstract: We systematically examine, analyze, and compare representative creativity

LLM-as-a-Judge--across diverse creative domains, including creative writing,
unconventional problem-solving, and research ideation. Our analyses reveal that
these metrics exhibit limited consistency, capturing different dimensions of
creativity. We highlight key limitations, including the creativity index's
focus on lexical diversity, perplexity's sensitivity to model confidence, and
syntactic templates' inability to capture conceptual creativity. Additionally,
LLM-as-a-Judge shows instability and bias. Our findings underscore the need for
more robust, generalizable evaluation frameworks that better align with human
judgments of creativity.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为LAG的新方法，通过逻辑分解和依赖感知推理增强大语言模型的知识密集型任务表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在知识密集型任务中容易产生幻觉，且现有检索增强生成方法在复杂推理场景中表现不佳。

Method: LAG将复杂问题分解为原子子问题，按逻辑依赖顺序解决，并引入逻辑终止机制防止错误传播。

Result: 实验表明LAG显著提升了推理鲁棒性，减少了幻觉，并与人类认知更一致。

Conclusion: LAG为现有RAG系统提供了一种有原则的替代方案，增强了逻辑推理能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
a wide range of tasks, yet exhibit critical limitations in knowledge-intensive
tasks, often generating hallucinations when faced with questions requiring
specialized expertise. While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates
this by integrating external knowledge, it struggles with complex reasoning
scenarios due to its reliance on direct semantic retrieval and lack of
structured logical organization. Inspired by Cartesian principles from
\textit{Discours de la m\'ethode}, this paper introduces Logic-Augmented
Generation (LAG), a novel paradigm that reframes knowledge augmentation through
systematic question decomposition and dependency-aware reasoning. Specifically,
LAG first decomposes complex questions into atomic sub-questions ordered by
logical dependencies. It then resolves these sequentially, using prior answers
to guide context retrieval for subsequent sub-questions, ensuring stepwise
grounding in logical chain. To prevent error propagation, LAG incorporates a
logical termination mechanism that halts inference upon encountering
unanswerable sub-questions and reduces wasted computation on excessive
reasoning. Finally, it synthesizes all sub-resolutions to generate verified
responses. Experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that LAG
significantly enhances reasoning robustness, reduces hallucination, and aligns
LLM problem-solving with human cognition, offering a principled alternative to
existing RAG systems.

Motivation: 研究LLMs在主动提问时的行为，以揭示其隐含的地理和文化偏见，而非通过传统提问方式触发模型的防护机制。

Method: 使用Geo20Q+数据集，在20 Questions游戏中测试LLMs，评估其在多语言和多配置下的表现。

Result: LLMs对全球北方和西方的实体推断更成功，且语言对性能差距影响较小。

Conclusion: 自由形式的评估框架能有效揭示LLMs的隐含偏见，地理和文化差异嵌入其推理过程中。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively tuned to mitigate explicit
biases, yet they often exhibit subtle implicit biases rooted in their
pre-training data. Rather than directly probing LLMs with human-crafted
questions that may trigger guardrails, we propose studying how models behave
when they proactively ask questions themselves. The 20 Questions game, a
multi-turn deduction task, serves as an ideal testbed for this purpose. We
systematically evaluate geographic performance disparities in entity deduction
using a new dataset, Geo20Q+, consisting of both notable people and culturally
significant objects (e.g., foods, landmarks, animals) from diverse regions. We
test popular LLMs across two gameplay configurations (canonical 20-question and
unlimited turns) and in seven languages (English, Hindi, Mandarin, Japanese,
French, Spanish, and Turkish). Our results reveal geographic disparities: LLMs
are substantially more successful at deducing entities from the Global North
than the Global South, and the Global West than the Global East. While
Wikipedia pageviews and pre-training corpus frequency correlate mildly with
performance, they fail to fully explain these disparities. Notably, the
language in which the game is played has minimal impact on performance gaps.
These findings demonstrate the value of creative, free-form evaluation
frameworks for uncovering subtle biases in LLMs that remain hidden in standard
prompting setups. By analyzing how models initiate and pursue reasoning goals
over multiple turns, we find geographic and cultural disparities embedded in
their reasoning processes. We release the dataset (Geo20Q+) and code at
https://sites.google.com/view/llmbias20q/home.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在法律领域的应用受到生成不忠实或幻觉输出的限制，现有方法未能有效保证上下文的忠实整合。

Method: 提出CoCoLex解码策略，基于模型置信度动态结合生成和复制分布，鼓励直接复制上下文。

Result: 在五个法律基准测试中，CoCoLex优于现有上下文感知解码方法，尤其在长文本生成任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: CoCoLex通过增强对上下文的忠实性，为法律文本生成提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Due to their ability to process long and complex contexts, LLMs can offer key
benefits to the Legal domain, but their adoption has been hindered by their
tendency to generate unfaithful, ungrounded, or hallucinatory outputs. While
Retrieval-Augmented Generation offers a promising solution by grounding
generations in external knowledge, it offers no guarantee that the provided
context will be effectively integrated. To address this, context-aware decoding
strategies have been proposed to amplify the influence of relevant context, but
they usually do not explicitly enforce faithfulness to the context. In this
work, we introduce Confidence-guided Copy-based Decoding for Legal Text
Generation (CoCoLex)-a decoding strategy that dynamically interpolates the
model produced vocabulary distribution with a distribution derived based on
copying from the context. CoCoLex encourages direct copying based on the
model's confidence, ensuring greater fidelity to the source. Experimental
results on five legal benchmarks demonstrate that CoCoLex outperforms existing
context-aware decoding methods, particularly in long-form generation tasks.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在多选问答中的不可靠性问题（如幻觉和过度自信），以提升高风险领域的应用可信度。

Method: 采用多次独立采样模型输出分布，以最频繁样本为参考计算预测熵，结合共形预测提供覆盖保证。

Result: 在六个大型语言模型和四个数据集上的实验表明，频率预测熵优于基于logit的方法，并能有效控制误覆盖率。

Conclusion: 该方法为黑盒场景下的不确定性量化提供了模型无关的框架，增强了大型语言模型在实际应用中的可信度。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in
multiple-choice question answering (MCQA), but their inherent unreliability,
such as hallucination and overconfidence, limits their application in high-risk
domains. To address this, we propose a frequency-based uncertainty
quantification method under black-box settings, leveraging conformal prediction
(CP) to ensure provable coverage guarantees. Our approach involves multiple
independent samplings of the model's output distribution for each input, with
the most frequent sample serving as a reference to calculate predictive entropy
(PE). Experimental evaluations across six LLMs and four datasets (MedMCQA,
MedQA, MMLU, MMLU-Pro) demonstrate that frequency-based PE outperforms
logit-based PE in distinguishing between correct and incorrect predictions, as
measured by AUROC. Furthermore, the method effectively controls the empirical
miscoverage rate under user-specified risk levels, validating that sampling
frequency can serve as a viable substitute for logit-based probabilities in
black-box scenarios. This work provides a distribution-free model-agnostic
framework for reliable uncertainty quantification in MCQA with guaranteed
coverage, enhancing the trustworthiness of LLMs in practical applications.

Motivation: 探讨不同语言背景下政治观点是否在MLLMs中存在跨语言差异。

Method: 通过提示MLLMs对政治声明表达（不）同意，评估其观点，并在对齐前后对比分析。

Result: 未对齐模型跨语言差异极少，对齐后观点在五种语言中几乎一致变化。

Conclusion: 西方语言背景下，政治观点在语言间传递，突显MLLMs在社会语言、文化和政治对齐上的挑战。

Abstract: Public opinion surveys show cross-cultural differences in political opinions
between socio-cultural contexts. However, there is no clear evidence whether
these differences translate to cross-lingual differences in multilingual large
language models (MLLMs). We analyze whether opinions transfer between languages
or whether there are separate opinions for each language in MLLMs of various
sizes across five Western languages. We evaluate MLLMs' opinions by prompting
them to report their (dis)agreement with political statements from voting
advice applications. To better understand the interaction between languages in
the models, we evaluate them both before and after aligning them with more left
or right views using direct preference optimization and English alignment data
only. Our findings reveal that unaligned models show only very few significant
cross-lingual differences in the political opinions they reflect. The political
alignment shifts opinions almost uniformly across all five languages. We
conclude that in Western language contexts, political opinions transfer between
languages, demonstrating the challenges in achieving explicit socio-linguistic,
cultural, and political alignment of MLLMs.

Abstract: Large language models have achieved substantial progress in mathematical
reasoning, yet their advancement is limited by the scarcity of high-quality,
high-difficulty training data. Existing synthesis methods largely rely on
transforming human-written templates, limiting both diversity and scalability.
We propose MathSmith, a novel framework for synthesizing challenging
mathematical problems to enhance LLM reasoning. Rather than modifying existing
problems, MathSmith constructs new ones from scratch by randomly sampling
concept-explanation pairs from PlanetMath, ensuring data independence and
avoiding contamination. To increase difficulty, we design nine predefined
strategies as soft constraints during rationales. We further adopts
reinforcement learning to jointly optimize structural validity, reasoning
complexity, and answer consistency. The length of the reasoning trace generated
under autoregressive prompting is used to reflect cognitive complexity,
encouraging the creation of more demanding problems aligned with
long-chain-of-thought reasoning. Experiments across five benchmarks,
categorized as easy & medium (GSM8K, MATH-500) and hard (AIME2024, AIME2025,
OlympiadBench), show that MathSmith consistently outperforms existing baselines
under both short and long CoT settings. Additionally, a weakness-focused
variant generation module enables targeted improvement on specific concepts.
Overall, MathSmith exhibits strong scalability, generalization, and
transferability, highlighting the promise of high-difficulty synthetic data in
advancing LLM reasoning capabilities.

Motivation: 现有奖励模型（规则和模型）存在鲁棒性和易受攻击问题，需改进。

Method: 提出Cooper框架，结合规则和模型奖励优势，动态构建正负样本对训练奖励模型，并引入混合标注策略和基于参考的奖励建模。

Result: Cooper缓解奖励攻击，提升RL性能，如Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct平均准确率提升0.54%。

Conclusion: 动态更新奖励模型是解决奖励攻击的有效方法，为RL中奖励模型整合提供参考。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
reasoning tasks, where reinforcement learning (RL) serves as a key algorithm
for enhancing their reasoning capabilities. Currently, there are two mainstream
reward paradigms: model-based rewards and rule-based rewards. However, both
approaches suffer from limitations: rule-based rewards lack robustness, while
model-based rewards are vulnerable to reward hacking. To address these issues,
we propose Cooper(Co-optimizing Policy Model and Reward Model), a RL framework
that jointly optimizes both the policy model and the reward model. Cooper
leverages the high precision of rule-based rewards when identifying correct
responses, and dynamically constructs and selects positive-negative sample
pairs for continued training the reward model. This design enhances robustness
and mitigates the risk of reward hacking. To further support Cooper, we
introduce a hybrid annotation strategy that efficiently and accurately
generates training data for the reward model. We also propose a reference-based
reward modeling paradigm, where the reward model takes a reference answer as
input. Based on this design, we train a reward model named VerifyRM, which
achieves higher accuracy on VerifyBench compared to other models of the same
size. We conduct reinforcement learning using both VerifyRM and Cooper. Our
experiments show that Cooper not only alleviates reward hacking but also
improves end-to-end RL performance, for instance, achieving a 0.54% gain in
average accuracy on Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct. Our findings demonstrate that
dynamically updating reward model is an effective way to combat reward hacking,
providing a reference for better integrating reward models into RL.

Motivation: 探索语言模型在具身任务中的推理能力，填补现有评估方法的不足。

Method: 通过文本环境表示，模拟物理属性和空间关系，评估1,500个场景中的表现。

Result: 模型在明确指令下表现良好（85-96%），但在动态工具推理（56-85%）和隐式协作（63-85%）中表现下降。微调对单任务有效但对多任务无效。

Conclusion: 具身推理对当前模型构成根本性挑战，OmniEAR为评估和推进具身AI系统提供了严格基准。

Abstract: Large language models excel at abstract reasoning but their capacity for
embodied agent reasoning remains largely unexplored. We present OmniEAR, a
comprehensive framework for evaluating how language models reason about
physical interactions, tool usage, and multi-agent coordination in embodied
tasks. Unlike existing benchmarks that provide predefined tool sets or explicit
collaboration directives, OmniEAR requires agents to dynamically acquire
capabilities and autonomously determine coordination strategies based on task
demands. Through text-based environment representation, we model continuous
physical properties and complex spatial relationships across 1,500 scenarios
spanning household and industrial domains. Our systematic evaluation reveals
severe performance degradation when models must reason from constraints: while
achieving 85-96% success with explicit instructions, performance drops to
56-85% for tool reasoning and 63-85% for implicit collaboration, with compound
tasks showing over 50% failure rates. Surprisingly, complete environmental
information degrades coordination performance, indicating models cannot filter
task-relevant constraints. Fine-tuning improves single-agent tasks dramatically
(0.6% to 76.3%) but yields minimal multi-agent gains (1.5% to 5.5%), exposing
fundamental architectural limitations. These findings demonstrate that embodied
reasoning poses fundamentally different challenges than current models can
address, establishing OmniEAR as a rigorous benchmark for evaluating and
advancing embodied AI systems. Our code and data are included in the
supplementary materials and will be open-sourced upon acceptance.

Result: 在六个长事实性基准测试中，模型平均减少23.1%的幻觉率，回答详细程度提高23%，且整体回答质量未下降。

Conclusion: 新奖励函数有效提升了R-LLMs的事实推理能力，解决了在线强化学习中的奖励滥用问题。

Abstract: Reasoning Large Language Models (R-LLMs) have significantly advanced complex
reasoning tasks but often struggle with factuality, generating substantially
more hallucinations than their non-reasoning counterparts on long-form
factuality benchmarks. However, extending online Reinforcement Learning (RL), a
key component in recent R-LLM advancements, to the long-form factuality setting
poses several unique challenges due to the lack of reliable verification
methods. Previous work has utilized automatic factuality evaluation frameworks
such as FActScore to curate preference data in the offline RL setting, yet we
find that directly leveraging such methods as the reward in online RL leads to
reward hacking in multiple ways, such as producing less detailed or relevant
responses. We propose a novel reward function that simultaneously considers the
factual precision, response detail level, and answer relevance, and applies
online RL to learn high quality factual reasoning. Evaluated on six long-form
factuality benchmarks, our factual reasoning model achieves an average
reduction of 23.1 percentage points in hallucination rate, a 23% increase in
answer detail level, and no degradation in the overall response helpfulness.

TL;DR: 论文研究了如何利用线性探针（linear probes）分析大型语言模型（LLMs）在多轮对话中的说服动态，发现探针在捕捉说服成功、被说服者个性和说服策略等方面表现优异，甚至优于基于提示的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLMs如何说服人类，并探索轻量级工具（如线性探针）在分析复杂行为（如说服）中的潜力。

Method: 应用线性探针分析多轮对话中的说服动态，结合认知科学训练探针捕捉说服成功、被说服者个性和说服策略。

Result: 探针能识别对话中被说服的关键点，并在某些任务（如揭示说服策略）中优于基于提示的方法。

Conclusion: 线性探针是研究复杂行为（如欺骗和操纵）的高效工具，尤其适用于多轮对话和大规模数据分析。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have started to demonstrate the ability to
persuade humans, yet our understanding of how this dynamic transpires is
limited. Recent work has used linear probes, lightweight tools for analyzing
model representations, to study various LLM skills such as the ability to model
user sentiment and political perspective. Motivated by this, we apply probes to
study persuasion dynamics in natural, multi-turn conversations. We leverage
insights from cognitive science to train probes on distinct aspects of
persuasion: persuasion success, persuadee personality, and persuasion strategy.
Despite their simplicity, we show that they capture various aspects of
persuasion at both the sample and dataset levels. For instance, probes can
identify the point in a conversation where the persuadee was persuaded or where
persuasive success generally occurs across the entire dataset. We also show
that in addition to being faster than expensive prompting-based approaches,
probes can do just as well and even outperform prompting in some settings, such
as when uncovering persuasion strategy. This suggests probes as a plausible
avenue for studying other complex behaviours such as deception and
manipulation, especially in multi-turn settings and large-scale dataset
analysis where prompting-based methods would be computationally inefficient.

*Mehrdad Zakershahrak,Samira Ghodratnama*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: H-NET++是一种分层动态分块模型，通过端到端训练学习语言感知的分割，解决了字节级语言模型在形态丰富语言中的计算挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决字节级语言模型在形态丰富语言（MRLs）中因单词占用多字节而面临的计算挑战。

Method: 提出H-NET++，包括轻量级Transformer上下文混合器、两级潜在超先验、专门处理拼写伪影（如波斯语ZWNJ）以及基于课程的分阶段序列长度训练。

Result: 在1.4B标记的波斯语语料库上，H-NET++实现了最佳结果：比BPE-based GPT-2-fa压缩率提高12%，ParsGLUE提升5.4pp，ZWNJ损坏鲁棒性提高53%，形态边界F1达73.8%。

Conclusion: 分层动态分块为MRLs提供了无需显式监督的有效无分词器解决方案，同时保持计算效率。

Abstract: Byte-level language models eliminate fragile tokenizers but face
computational challenges in morphologically-rich languages (MRLs), where words
span many bytes. We propose H-NET++, a hierarchical dynamic-chunking model that
learns linguistically-informed segmentation through end-to-end training. Key
innovations include: (1) a lightweight Transformer context-mixer (1.9M
parameters) for cross-chunk attention, (2) a two-level latent hyper-prior for
document-level consistency, (3) specialized handling of orthographic artifacts
(e.g. Persian ZWNJ), and (4) curriculum-based training with staged sequence
lengths. On a 1.4B-token Persian corpus, H-NET++ achieves state-of-the-art
results: 0.159 BPB reduction versus BPE-based GPT-2-fa (12% better
compression), 5.4pp gain on ParsGLUE, 53% improved robustness to ZWNJ
corruption, and 73.8% F1 on gold morphological boundaries. Our learned chunks
align with Persian morphology without explicit supervision, demonstrating that
hierarchical dynamic chunking provides an effective tokenizer-free solution for
MRLs while maintaining computational efficiency.

*Mohab Kishawy,Ali Abdellatif Hussein,Jun Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RetinexDual是一种基于Retinex理论的新框架，用于超高清图像恢复（UHD IR），通过两个互补子网络（SAMBA和FIA）解决传统方法的局限性，并在多个任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法（如下采样或频域转换）在超高清图像恢复中存在信息丢失或局部退化问题，RetinexDual旨在克服这些限制。

Method: RetinexDual包含两个子网络：SAMBA（用于反射分量校正，采用粗到细机制）和FIA（用于频域中的颜色和光照校正）。

Result: 在去雨、去模糊、去雾和低光增强等任务中，RetinexDual在质量和定量指标上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RetinexDual通过独特设计和多组件协作，显著提升了超高清图像恢复的性能。

Abstract: Advancements in image sensing have elevated the importance of
Ultra-High-Definition Image Restoration (UHD IR). Traditional methods, such as
extreme downsampling or transformation from the spatial to the frequency
domain, encounter significant drawbacks: downsampling induces irreversible
information loss in UHD images, while our frequency analysis reveals that pure
frequency-domain approaches are ineffective for spatially confined image
artifacts, primarily due to the loss of degradation locality. To overcome these
limitations, we present RetinexDual, a novel Retinex theory-based framework
designed for generalized UHD IR tasks. RetinexDual leverages two complementary
sub-networks: the Scale-Attentive maMBA (SAMBA) and the Frequency Illumination
Adaptor (FIA). SAMBA, responsible for correcting the reflectance component,
utilizes a coarse-to-fine mechanism to overcome the causal modeling of mamba,
which effectively reduces artifacts and restores intricate details. On the
other hand, FIA ensures precise correction of color and illumination
distortions by operating in the frequency domain and leveraging the global
context provided by it. Evaluating RetinexDual on four UHD IR tasks, namely
deraining, deblurring, dehazing, and Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE), shows
that it outperforms recent methods qualitatively and quantitatively. Ablation
studies demonstrate the importance of employing distinct designs for each
branch in RetinexDual, as well as the effectiveness of its various components.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了ENTRep挑战赛，旨在通过多模态（图像和文本）和双语支持改进ENT内窥镜分析的自动化方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前ENT内窥镜分析受限于设备、操作者差异及细微病变的识别，且缺乏公共基准支持分类和检索任务。

Method: 提出ENTRep数据集，包含专家标注的图像（解剖区域和异常状态）及双语描述，并定义了三个基准任务和标准化提交协议。

Result: 通过公开和私有测试集评估性能，并报告了顶尖团队的结果和讨论。

Conclusion: ENTRep为ENT内窥镜分析提供了多模态和双语支持的新基准，推动了自动化分析的发展。

Abstract: Automated analysis of endoscopic imagery is a critical yet underdeveloped
component of ENT (ear, nose, and throat) care, hindered by variability in
devices and operators, subtle and localized findings, and fine-grained
distinctions such as laterality and vocal-fold state. In addition to
classification, clinicians require reliable retrieval of similar cases, both
visually and through concise textual descriptions. These capabilities are
rarely supported by existing public benchmarks. To this end, we introduce
ENTRep, the ACM Multimedia 2025 Grand Challenge on ENT endoscopy analysis,
which integrates fine-grained anatomical classification with image-to-image and
text-to-image retrieval under bilingual (Vietnamese and English) clinical
supervision. Specifically, the dataset comprises expert-annotated images,
labeled for anatomical region and normal or abnormal status, and accompanied by
dual-language narrative descriptions. In addition, we define three benchmark
tasks, standardize the submission protocol, and evaluate performance on public
and private test splits using server-side scoring. Moreover, we report results
from the top-performing teams and provide an insight discussion.

TL;DR: CoMAD是一种轻量级、无参数的框架，通过从多个自监督ViT教师模型中蒸馏知识到紧凑学生网络，提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督学习模型通常独立预训练，忽略了互补性，且模型大、资源消耗高。CoMAD旨在统一多教师模型的优势，实现高效部署。

Method: 采用非对称掩码策略，学生仅看到25%的补丁，而教师接收不同的掩码。通过线性适配器和层归一化对齐教师嵌入，并使用联合共识门控融合知识。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K上，ViT-Tiny达到75.4% Top-1，密集预测任务中表现优异，刷新紧凑SSL蒸馏的SOTA。

Conclusion: CoMAD通过多教师蒸馏和共识机制，显著提升了紧凑模型的性能，适用于资源受限场景。

Abstract: Numerous self-supervised learning paradigms, such as contrastive learning and
masked image modeling, learn powerful representations from unlabeled data but
are typically pretrained in isolation, overlooking complementary insights and
yielding large models that are impractical for resource-constrained deployment.
To overcome these challenges, we introduce Consensus-oriented Masked
Distillation (CoMAD), a lightweight, parameter-free framework that unifies
knowledge from multiple current state-of-the-art self-supervised Vision
Transformers into a compact student network. CoMAD distills from three
pretrained ViT-Base teachers, MAE, MoCo v3, and iBOT, each offering distinct
semantic and contextual priors. Rather than naively averaging teacher outputs,
we apply asymmetric masking: the student sees only 25 percent of patches while
each teacher receives a progressively lighter, unique mask, forcing the student
to interpolate missing features under richer contexts. Teacher embeddings are
aligned to the student's space via a linear adapter and layer normalization,
then fused through our joint consensus gating, which weights each token by
combining cosine affinity with inter-teacher agreement. The student is trained
with dual-level KL divergence on visible tokens and reconstructed feature maps,
capturing both local and global structure. On ImageNet-1K, CoMAD's ViT-Tiny
achieves 75.4 percent Top-1, an increment of 0.4 percent over the previous
state-of-the-art. In dense-prediction transfers, it attains 47.3 percent mIoU
on ADE20K, and 44.5 percent box average precision and 40.5 percent mask average
precision on MS-COCO, establishing a new state-of-the-art in compact SSL
distillation.

TL;DR: RADAR提出了一种基于注意力机制的扩散模型，用于实时异常检测，避免了传统重建方法的计算成本高和模式偏差问题，并在多个数据集上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于重建的扩散模型在异常检测中存在计算成本高、模式偏差和噪声水平选择困难的问题，RADAR旨在解决这些问题。

Method: RADAR直接通过扩散模型生成异常图，避免了重建过程，提高了效率和准确性。

Result: 在MVTec-AD和3D打印材料数据集上，RADAR的F1分数分别提高了7%和13%。

Conclusion: RADAR是一种高效且准确的异常检测方法，适用于实时应用。

Abstract: Generative models have demonstrated significant success in anomaly detection
and segmentation over the past decade. Recently, diffusion models have emerged
as a powerful alternative, outperforming previous approaches such as GANs and
VAEs. In typical diffusion-based anomaly detection, a model is trained on
normal data, and during inference, anomalous images are perturbed to a
predefined intermediate step in the forward diffusion process. The
corresponding normal image is then reconstructed through iterative reverse
sampling.
  However, reconstruction-based approaches present three major challenges: (1)
the reconstruction process is computationally expensive due to multiple
sampling steps, making real-time applications impractical; (2) for complex or
subtle patterns, the reconstructed image may correspond to a different normal
pattern rather than the original input; and (3) Choosing an appropriate
intermediate noise level is challenging because it is application-dependent and
often assumes prior knowledge of anomalies, an assumption that does not hold in
unsupervised settings.
  We introduce Reconstruction-free Anomaly Detection with Attention-based
diffusion models in Real-time (RADAR), which overcomes the limitations of
reconstruction-based anomaly detection. Unlike current SOTA methods that
reconstruct the input image, RADAR directly produces anomaly maps from the
diffusion model, improving both detection accuracy and computational
efficiency. We evaluate RADAR on real-world 3D-printed material and the
MVTec-AD dataset. Our approach surpasses state-of-the-art diffusion-based and
statistical machine learning models across all key metrics, including accuracy,
precision, recall, and F1 score. Specifically, RADAR improves F1 score by 7% on
MVTec-AD and 13% on the 3D-printed material dataset compared to the next best
model.

Motivation: 人眼运动速度快（300°/s），传统高精度追踪设备昂贵，研究旨在开发低成本、高精度的解决方案，应用于VR/AR等领域。

Method: 采用事件相机输入，结合深度学习（CNN_LSTM模型）预测人眼中心位置。

Result: CNN_LSTM模型表现最佳，准确率约81%。

Conclusion: 未来工作将聚焦于Layer-wise Relevance Propagation（LRP），以提升模型可解释性和预测性能。

Abstract: This research project addresses the challenge of accurately tracking eye
movements during specific events by leveraging previous research. Given the
rapid movements of human eyes, which can reach speeds of 300{\deg}/s, precise
eye tracking typically requires expensive and high-speed cameras. Our primary
objective is to locate the eye center position (x, y) using inputs from an
event camera. Eye movement analysis has extensive applications in consumer
electronics, especially in VR and AR product development. Therefore, our
ultimate goal is to develop an interpretable and cost-effective algorithm using
deep learning methods to predict human attention, thereby improving device
comfort and enhancing overall user experience. To achieve this goal, we
explored various approaches, with the CNN\_LSTM model proving most effective,
achieving approximately 81\% accuracy. Additionally, we propose future work
focusing on Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) to further enhance the
model's interpretability and predictive performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在预测精度和计算效率之间难以平衡，LuKAN旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 使用离散小波变换编码时间信息，空间投影层捕捉关节依赖关系，核心为基于Lucas多项式的KAN层。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上表现优异，计算效率高。

Conclusion: LuKAN在精度和效率上均优于现有方法。

Abstract: The goal of 3D human motion prediction is to forecast future 3D poses of the
human body based on historical motion data. Existing methods often face
limitations in achieving a balance between prediction accuracy and
computational efficiency. In this paper, we present LuKAN, an effective model
based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) with Lucas polynomial activations.
Our model first applies the discrete wavelet transform to encode temporal
information in the input motion sequence. Then, a spatial projection layer is
used to capture inter-joint dependencies, ensuring structural consistency of
the human body. At the core of LuKAN is the Temporal Dependency Learner, which
employs a KAN layer parameterized by Lucas polynomials for efficient function
approximation. These polynomials provide computational efficiency and an
enhanced capability to handle oscillatory behaviors. Finally, the inverse
discrete wavelet transform reconstructs motion sequences in the time domain,
generating temporally coherent predictions. Extensive experiments on three
benchmark datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of our model
compared to strong baselines, as evidenced by both quantitative and qualitative
evaluations. Moreover, its compact architecture coupled with the linear
recurrence of Lucas polynomials, ensures computational efficiency.

TL;DR: VER-Bench是一个评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在细粒度视觉线索识别和复杂推理能力上的新框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试在评估MLLMs的视觉能力时存在不足，无法全面测试模型对细微视觉线索的理解和复杂推理能力。

Method: 提出VER-Bench，包含374个精心设计的问题，覆盖多种推理类型，每个问题附带视觉线索和相关推理证据。

Result: 发现当前模型在提取细微视觉证据和构建基于证据的推理方面存在局限性。

Conclusion: 需要提升模型在细粒度视觉证据提取、整合和推理方面的能力，以实现真正的视觉理解和类人分析。

Abstract: With the rapid development of MLLMs, evaluating their visual capabilities has
become increasingly crucial. Current benchmarks primarily fall into two main
types: basic perception benchmarks, which focus on local details but lack deep
reasoning (e.g., "what is in the image?"), and mainstream reasoning benchmarks,
which concentrate on prominent image elements but may fail to assess subtle
clues requiring intricate analysis. However, profound visual understanding and
complex reasoning depend more on interpreting subtle, inconspicuous local
details than on perceiving salient, macro-level objects. These details, though
occupying minimal image area, often contain richer, more critical information
for robust analysis. To bridge this gap, we introduce the VER-Bench, a novel
framework to evaluate MLLMs' ability to: 1) identify fine-grained visual clues,
often occupying on average just 0.25% of the image area; 2) integrate these
clues with world knowledge for complex reasoning. Comprising 374 carefully
designed questions across Geospatial, Temporal, Situational, Intent, System
State, and Symbolic reasoning, each question in VER-Bench is accompanied by
structured evidence: visual clues and question-related reasoning derived from
them. VER-Bench reveals current models' limitations in extracting subtle visual
evidence and constructing evidence-based arguments, highlighting the need to
enhance models's capabilities in fine-grained visual evidence extraction,
integration, and reasoning for genuine visual understanding and human-like
analysis. Dataset and additional materials are available

Motivation: Transformer检测器在遮挡、细粒度定位和计算效率上存在不足，需要改进。

Method: 提出DAMM框架，结合视觉语言模型的外观查询、多边形嵌入的位置查询和随机学习查询，并通过双流注意力模块分别优化语义和空间特征。

Conclusion: 多模态查询适应和双流注意力机制有效提升了检测器的性能。

Abstract: Transformer-based object detectors often struggle with occlusions,
fine-grained localization, and computational inefficiency caused by fixed
queries and dense attention. We propose DAMM, Dual-stream Attention with
Multi-Modal queries, a novel framework introducing both query adaptation and
structured cross-attention for improved accuracy and efficiency. DAMM
capitalizes on three types of queries: appearance-based queries from
vision-language models, positional queries using polygonal embeddings, and
random learned queries for general scene coverage. Furthermore, a dual-stream
cross-attention module separately refines semantic and spatial features,
boosting localization precision in cluttered scenes. We evaluated DAMM on four
challenging benchmarks, and it achieved state-of-the-art performance in average
precision (AP) and recall, demonstrating the effectiveness of multi-modal query
adaptation and dual-stream attention. Source code is at:

Conclusion: 研究强调了时间感知模型和基准的必要性，以提高多模态仇恨视频检测的鲁棒性和可解释性。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of online multimedia content has intensified the
spread of hate speech, presenting critical societal and regulatory challenges.
While recent work has advanced multimodal hateful video detection, most
approaches rely on coarse, video-level annotations that overlook the temporal
granularity of hateful content. This introduces substantial label noise, as
videos annotated as hateful often contain long non-hateful segments. In this
paper, we investigate the impact of such label ambiguity through a fine-grained
approach. Specifically, we trim hateful videos from the HateMM and
MultiHateClip English datasets using annotated timestamps to isolate explicitly
hateful segments. We then conduct an exploratory analysis of these trimmed
segments to examine the distribution and characteristics of both hateful and
non-hateful content. This analysis highlights the degree of semantic overlap
and the confusion introduced by coarse, video-level annotations. Finally,
controlled experiments demonstrated that time-stamp noise fundamentally alters
model decision boundaries and weakens classification confidence, highlighting
the inherent context dependency and temporal continuity of hate speech
expression. Our findings provide new insights into the temporal dynamics of
multimodal hateful videos and highlight the need for temporally aware models
and benchmarks for improved robustness and interpretability. Code and data are

Method: 提出Highlight-TTA框架，结合跨模态幻觉辅助任务，通过元辅助训练方案优化模型，并在测试时动态调整模型。

Result: 在三个基准数据集和三种先进模型上的实验表明，Highlight-TTA显著提升了高光检测性能。

Conclusion: Highlight-TTA通过测试时自适应和辅助任务优化，有效提升了视频高光检测的泛化能力和性能。

Abstract: Existing video highlight detection methods, although advanced, struggle to
generalize well to all test videos. These methods typically employ a generic
highlight detection model for each test video, which is suboptimal as it fails
to account for the unique characteristics and variations of individual test
videos. Such fixed models do not adapt to the diverse content, styles, or audio
and visual qualities present in new, unseen test videos, leading to reduced
highlight detection performance. In this paper, we propose Highlight-TTA, a
test-time adaptation framework for video highlight detection that addresses
this limitation by dynamically adapting the model during testing to better
align with the specific characteristics of each test video, thereby improving
generalization and highlight detection performance. Highlight-TTA is jointly
optimized with an auxiliary task, cross-modality hallucinations, alongside the
primary highlight detection task. We utilize a meta-auxiliary training scheme
to enable effective adaptation through the auxiliary task while enhancing the
primary task. During testing, we adapt the trained model using the auxiliary
task on the test video to further enhance its highlight detection performance.
Extensive experiments with three state-of-the-art highlight detection models
and three benchmark datasets show that the introduction of Highlight-TTA to
these models improves their performance, yielding superior results.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种方法，将基于透视图像训练的单目深度估计器（FMDEs）扩展到鱼眼图像，通过校准令牌调整潜在嵌入分布，无需重新训练或微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FMDEs在鱼眼图像上因相机参数变化（内参、畸变）导致深度估计错误，需解决分布偏移问题。

Method: 引入校准令牌作为轻量级适配机制，调整潜在嵌入以对齐分布，利用自监督学习，无需鱼眼图像数据。

Result: 在室内外场景中，使用单一令牌集显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了FMDEs在鱼眼图像上的分布偏移问题，无需额外训练数据或复杂调整。

Abstract: We propose a method to extend foundational monocular depth estimators
(FMDEs), trained on perspective images, to fisheye images. Despite being
trained on tens of millions of images, FMDEs are susceptible to the covariate
shift introduced by changes in camera calibration (intrinsic, distortion)
parameters, leading to erroneous depth estimates. Our method aligns the
distribution of latent embeddings encoding fisheye images to those of
perspective images, enabling the reuse of FMDEs for fisheye cameras without
retraining or finetuning. To this end, we introduce a set of Calibration Tokens
as a light-weight adaptation mechanism that modulates the latent embeddings for
alignment. By exploiting the already expressive latent space of FMDEs, we posit
that modulating their embeddings avoids the negative impact of artifacts and
loss introduced in conventional recalibration or map projection to a canonical
reference frame in the image space. Our method is self-supervised and does not
require fisheye images but leverages publicly available large-scale perspective
image datasets. This is done by recalibrating perspective images to fisheye
images, and enforcing consistency between their estimates during training. We
evaluate our approach with several FMDEs, on both indoors and outdoors, where
we consistently improve over state-of-the-art methods using a single set of
tokens for both. Code available at:

Result: 实验表明，TrueBiometric能够100%准确检测并修正被投毒图像，且不影响干净图像的准确性。

Conclusion: TrueBiometric为防御人脸识别系统中的后门攻击提供了更实用、准确和有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Biometric systems, such as face recognition systems powered by deep neural
networks (DNNs), rely on large and highly sensitive datasets. Backdoor attacks
can subvert these systems by manipulating the training process. By inserting a
small trigger, such as a sticker, make-up, or patterned mask, into a few
training images, an adversary can later present the same trigger during
authentication to be falsely recognized as another individual, thereby gaining
unauthorized access. Existing defense mechanisms against backdoor attacks still
face challenges in precisely identifying and mitigating poisoned images without
compromising data utility, which undermines the overall reliability of the
system. We propose a novel and generalizable approach, TrueBiometric:
Trustworthy Biometrics, which accurately detects poisoned images using a
majority voting mechanism leveraging multiple state-of-the-art large vision
language models. Once identified, poisoned samples are corrected using targeted
and calibrated corrective noise. Our extensive empirical results demonstrate
that TrueBiometric detects and corrects poisoned images with 100\% accuracy
without compromising accuracy on clean images. Compared to existing
state-of-the-art approaches, TrueBiometric offers a more practical, accurate,
and effective solution for mitigating backdoor attacks in face recognition
systems.

Abstract: In this paper, we describe a feedforward artificial neural network trained on
the ImageNet 2012 contest dataset [7] with the new method of [5] to an accuracy
rate of 98.3% with a 99.69 Top-1 rate, and an average of 285.9 labels that are
perfectly classified over the 10 batch partitions of the dataset. The best
performing model uses 322,430,160 parameters, with 4 decimal places precision.
We conjecture that the reason our model does not achieve a 100% accuracy rate
is due to a double-labeling problem, by which there are duplicate images in the
dataset with different labels.

TL;DR: ProMIM是一个增强视觉语言模型（VLM）的框架，通过结合掩码图像建模（MIM）改进现有提示学习方法，提升泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示学习方法（如CoOp和CoCoOp）在适应新任务时容易过拟合已知类别，泛化能力不足。

Method: ProMIM通过掩码可见图像块生成实例条件提示，增强特征鲁棒性，减少过拟合，且计算成本低。

Result: 实验表明，ProMIM在零样本和小样本分类任务中显著提升泛化性能。

Conclusion: ProMIM为视觉语言应用提供了一种轻量级、高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP excel in zero-shot learning but often
require resource-intensive training to adapt to new tasks. Prompt learning
techniques, such as CoOp and CoCoOp, offer efficient adaptation but tend to
overfit to known classes, limiting generalization to unseen categories. We
introduce ProMIM, a plug-and-play framework that enhances conditional prompt
learning by integrating masked image modeling (MIM) into existing VLM
pipelines. ProMIM leverages a simple yet effective masking strategy to generate
robust, instance-conditioned prompts, seamlessly augmenting methods like CoOp
and CoCoOp without altering their core architectures. By masking only visible
image patches and using these representations to guide prompt generation,
ProMIM improves feature robustness and mitigates overfitting, all while
introducing negligible additional computational cost. Extensive experiments
across zero-shot and few-shot classification tasks demonstrate that ProMIM
consistently boosts generalization performance when plugged into existing
approaches, providing a practical, lightweight solution for real-world
vision-language applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为TRKT的方法，通过关系感知知识挖掘和双流融合模块，解决了弱监督动态场景图生成中外部物体检测器的局限性，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 弱监督动态场景图生成（WS-DSGG）依赖外部物体检测器，但静态图像训练的检测器在动态场景中表现不佳，导致定位不准确和低置信度。

Method: TRKT包含关系感知知识挖掘（利用类别特定注意力图和帧间注意力增强）和双流融合模块（整合注意力图优化检测）。

Result: 在Action Genome数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: TRKT通过动态场景中的关系感知知识转移，显著提升了WS-DSGG的效果。

Abstract: Dynamic Scene Graph Generation (DSGG) aims to create a scene graph for each
video frame by detecting objects and predicting their relationships. Weakly
Supervised DSGG (WS-DSGG) reduces annotation workload by using an unlocalized
scene graph from a single frame per video for training. Existing WS-DSGG
methods depend on an off-the-shelf external object detector to generate pseudo
labels for subsequent DSGG training. However, detectors trained on static,
object-centric images struggle in dynamic, relation-aware scenarios required
for DSGG, leading to inaccurate localization and low-confidence proposals. To
address the challenges posed by external object detectors in WS-DSGG, we
propose a Temporal-enhanced Relation-aware Knowledge Transferring (TRKT)
method, which leverages knowledge to enhance detection in relation-aware
dynamic scenarios. TRKT is built on two key components:(1)Relation-aware
knowledge mining: we first employ object and relation class decoders that
generate category-specific attention maps to highlight both object regions and
interactive areas. Then we propose an Inter-frame Attention Augmentation
strategy that exploits optical flow for neighboring frames to enhance the
attention maps, making them motion-aware and robust to motion blur. This step
yields relation- and motion-aware knowledge mining for WS-DSGG. (2) we
introduce a Dual-stream Fusion Module that integrates category-specific
attention maps into external detections to refine object localization and boost
confidence scores for object proposals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
TRKT achieves state-of-the-art performance on Action Genome dataset. Our code
is avaliable at https://github.com/XZPKU/TRKT.git.

Motivation: 研究标准自监督学习方法在域偏移（如生物医学图像中的批次效应）下的鲁棒性问题。

Method: 在DINOv2架构中集成梯度反转层，实现域不变特征学习，应用于非小细胞肺癌的多重免疫荧光图像。

Result: AdvDINO减少了图像特异性偏差，揭示了具有不同蛋白质组学和预后意义的表型簇，并提高了生存预测性能。

Conclusion: AdvDINO不仅适用于生物医学图像，还可推广到其他域偏移问题显著的领域。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful approach for
learning visual representations without manual annotations. However, the
robustness of standard SSL methods to domain shift -- systematic differences
across data sources -- remains uncertain, posing an especially critical
challenge in biomedical imaging where batch effects can obscure true biological
signals. We present AdvDINO, a domain-adversarial self-supervised learning
framework that integrates a gradient reversal layer into the DINOv2
architecture to promote domain-invariant feature learning. Applied to a
real-world cohort of six-channel multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) whole slide
images from non-small cell lung cancer patients, AdvDINO mitigates
slide-specific biases to learn more robust and biologically meaningful
representations than non-adversarial baselines. Across $>5.46$ million mIF
image tiles, the model uncovers phenotype clusters with distinct proteomic
profiles and prognostic significance, and improves survival prediction in
attention-based multiple instance learning. While demonstrated on mIF data,
AdvDINO is broadly applicable to other imaging domains -- including radiology,
remote sensing, and autonomous driving -- where domain shift and limited
annotated data hinder model generalization and interpretability.

Conclusion: HOW-Seg通过人机交互动态优化预测，显著提升了开世界点云语义分割的性能和实用性。

Abstract: Open-world point cloud semantic segmentation (OW-Seg) aims to predict point
labels of both base and novel classes in real-world scenarios. However,
existing methods rely on resource-intensive offline incremental learning or
densely annotated support data, limiting their practicality. To address these
limitations, we propose HOW-Seg, the first human-in-the-loop framework for
OW-Seg. Specifically, we construct class prototypes, the fundamental
segmentation units, directly on the query data, avoiding the prototype bias
caused by intra-class distribution shifts between the support and query data.
By leveraging sparse human annotations as guidance, HOW-Seg enables
prototype-based segmentation for both base and novel classes. Considering the
lack of granularity of initial prototypes, we introduce a hierarchical
prototype disambiguation mechanism to refine ambiguous prototypes, which
correspond to annotations of different classes. To further enrich contextual
awareness, we employ a dense conditional random field (CRF) upon the refined
prototypes to optimize their label assignments. Through iterative human
feedback, HOW-Seg dynamically improves its predictions, achieving high-quality
segmentation for both base and novel classes. Experiments demonstrate that with
sparse annotations (e.g., one-novel-class-one-click), HOW-Seg matches or
surpasses the state-of-the-art generalized few-shot segmentation (GFS-Seg)
method under the 5-shot setting. When using advanced backbones (e.g.,
Stratified Transformer) and denser annotations (e.g., 10 clicks per sub-scene),
HOW-Seg achieves 85.27% mIoU on S3DIS and 66.37% mIoU on ScanNetv2,
significantly outperforming alternatives.

Result: 在稀疏视角3D合成中表现优异，PSNR提升3.27%。

Conclusion: 自适应加权和未确定性学习显著提升稀疏视角下的渲染质量和效率。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a competitive approach for novel view
synthesis (NVS) due to its advanced rendering efficiency through 3D Gaussian
projection and blending. However, Gaussians are treated equally weighted for
rendering in most 3DGS methods, making them prone to overfitting, which is
particularly the case in sparse-view scenarios. To address this, we investigate
how adaptive weighting of Gaussians affects rendering quality, which is
characterised by learned uncertainties proposed. This learned uncertainty
serves two key purposes: first, it guides the differentiable update of Gaussian
opacity while preserving the 3DGS pipeline integrity; second, the uncertainty
undergoes soft differentiable dropout regularisation, which strategically
transforms the original uncertainty into continuous drop probabilities that
govern the final Gaussian projection and blending process for rendering.
Extensive experimental results over widely adopted datasets demonstrate that
our method outperforms rivals in sparse-view 3D synthesis, achieving higher
quality reconstruction with fewer Gaussians in most datasets compared to
existing sparse-view approaches, e.g., compared to DropGaussian, our method
achieves 3.27\% PSNR improvements on the MipNeRF 360 dataset.

Conclusion: 可变画布尺寸和可调帧率显著提升了实时感知系统的性能，为边缘计算提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Real-time perception on edge platforms faces a core challenge: executing
high-resolution object detection under stringent latency constraints on limited
computing resources. Canvas-based attention scheduling was proposed in earlier
work as a mechanism to reduce the resource demands of perception subsystems. It
consolidates areas of interest in an input data frame onto a smaller area,
called a canvas frame, that can be processed at the requisite frame rate. This
paper extends prior canvas-based attention scheduling literature by (i)
allowing for variable-size canvas frames and (ii) employing selectable canvas
frame rates that may depart from the original data frame rate. We evaluate our
solution by running YOLOv11, as the perception module, on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin
Nano to inspect video frames from the Waymo Open Dataset. Our results show that
the additional degrees of freedom improve the attainable quality/cost
trade-offs, thereby allowing for a consistently higher mean average precision
(mAP) and recall with respect to the state of the art.

Result: SODEC在率失真感知性能上显著优于现有方法，解码速度提升超过20倍。

Conclusion: SODEC通过单步解码和保真度优化，实现了高效的图像压缩，解决了扩散模型的延迟和保真度问题。

Abstract: Diffusion-based image compression has demonstrated impressive perceptual
performance. However, it suffers from two critical drawbacks: (1) excessive
decoding latency due to multi-step sampling, and (2) poor fidelity resulting
from over-reliance on generative priors. To address these issues, we propose
SODEC, a novel single-step diffusion image compression model. We argue that in
image compression, a sufficiently informative latent renders multi-step
refinement unnecessary. Based on this insight, we leverage a pre-trained
VAE-based model to produce latents with rich information, and replace the
iterative denoising process with a single-step decoding. Meanwhile, to improve
fidelity, we introduce the fidelity guidance module, encouraging output that is
faithful to the original image. Furthermore, we design the rate annealing
training strategy to enable effective training under extremely low bitrates.
Extensive experiments show that SODEC significantly outperforms existing
methods, achieving superior rate-distortion-perception performance. Moreover,
compared to previous diffusion-based compression models, SODEC improves
decoding speed by more than 20$\times$. Code is released at:

Motivation: 现有基于学习的深度补全模型在OOD场景中性能显著下降，而基础模型在大规模训练中表现出鲁棒性，因此探索如何利用基础模型提升深度补全的鲁棒性。

Method: 利用深度基础模型提取RGB图像的环境线索，设计无参数的双空间传播方法（3D和2D），并引入可学习的校正模块逐步调整深度预测。

Conclusion: 该框架通过结合深度基础模型和无参数传播方法，显著提升了深度补全的鲁棒性，适用于多样化场景。

Abstract: Depth completion is a pivotal challenge in computer vision, aiming at
reconstructing the dense depth map from a sparse one, typically with a paired
RGB image. Existing learning based models rely on carefully prepared but
limited data, leading to significant performance degradation in
out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. Recent foundation models have demonstrated
exceptional robustness in monocular depth estimation through large-scale
training, and using such models to enhance the robustness of depth completion
models is a promising solution. In this work, we propose a novel depth
completion framework that leverages depth foundation models to attain
remarkable robustness without large-scale training. Specifically, we leverage a
depth foundation model to extract environmental cues, including structural and
semantic context, from RGB images to guide the propagation of sparse depth
information into missing regions. We further design a dual-space propagation
approach, without any learnable parameters, to effectively propagates sparse
depth in both 3D and 2D spaces to maintain geometric structure and local
consistency. To refine the intricate structure, we introduce a learnable
correction module to progressively adjust the depth prediction towards the real
depth. We train our model on the NYUv2 and KITTI datasets as in-distribution
datasets and extensively evaluate the framework on 16 other datasets. Our
framework performs remarkably well in the OOD scenarios and outperforms
existing state-of-the-art depth completion methods. Our models are released in

Result: 实验表明，方法在多种设置下性能提升高达9%，计算效率提升9倍。

Conclusion: 模态分离框架有效解决了模态间隙问题，显著提升了无监督域适应的性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) enables models trained on a labeled
source domain to handle new unlabeled domains. Recently, pre-trained
vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated promising zero-shot performance
by leveraging semantic information to facilitate target tasks. By aligning
vision and text embeddings, VLMs have shown notable success in bridging domain
gaps. However, inherent differences naturally exist between modalities, which
is known as modality gap. Our findings reveal that direct UDA with the presence
of modality gap only transfers modality-invariant knowledge, leading to
suboptimal target performance. To address this limitation, we propose a unified
modality separation framework that accommodates both modality-specific and
modality-invariant components. During training, different modality components
are disentangled from VLM features then handled separately in a unified manner.
At test time, modality-adaptive ensemble weights are automatically determined
to maximize the synergy of different components. To evaluate instance-level
modality characteristics, we design a modality discrepancy metric to categorize
samples into modality-invariant, modality-specific, and uncertain ones. The
modality-invariant samples are exploited to facilitate cross-modal alignment,
while uncertain ones are annotated to enhance model capabilities. Building upon
prompt tuning techniques, our methods achieve up to 9% performance gain with 9
times of computational efficiencies. Extensive experiments and analysis across
various backbones, baselines, datasets and adaptation settings demonstrate the
efficacy of our design.

Result: 熟悉性训练使早期层对全局上下文敏感，LoRA显著增强效果，自注意力范围扩大。

Conclusion: 快速权重架构为研究大脑快速全局上下文学习提供了可行计算模型。

Abstract: Recent neurophysiological studies have revealed that the early visual cortex
can rapidly learn global image context, as evidenced by a sparsification of
population responses and a reduction in mean activity when exposed to familiar
versus novel image contexts. This phenomenon has been attributed primarily to
local recurrent interactions, rather than changes in feedforward or feedback
pathways, supported by both empirical findings and circuit-level modeling.
Recurrent neural circuits capable of simulating these effects have been shown
to reshape the geometry of neural manifolds, enhancing robustness and
invariance to irrelevant variations. In this study, we employ a Vision
Transformer (ViT)-based autoencoder to investigate, from a functional
perspective, how familiarity training can induce sensitivity to global context
in the early layers of a deep neural network. We hypothesize that rapid
learning operates via fast weights, which encode transient or short-term memory
traces, and we explore the use of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to implement such
fast weights within each Transformer layer. Our results show that (1) The
proposed ViT-based autoencoder's self-attention circuit performs a manifold
transform similar to a neural circuit model of the familiarity effect. (2)
Familiarity training aligns latent representations in early layers with those
in the top layer that contains global context information. (3) Familiarity
training broadens the self-attention scope within the remembered image context.
(4) These effects are significantly amplified by LoRA-based fast weights.
Together, these findings suggest that familiarity training introduces global
sensitivity to earlier layers in a hierarchical network, and that a hybrid
fast-and-slow weight architecture may provide a viable computational model for
studying rapid global context learning in the brain.

Result: 在多个Re-ID数据集上取得最优结果，尤其在遮挡和细微属性差异场景中表现突出。

Conclusion: AG-ReID有效解决了遮挡Re-ID的挑战，同时保持标准场景的竞争力。

Abstract: Person re-identification (Re-ID) aims to match person images across different
camera views, with occluded Re-ID addressing scenarios where pedestrians are
partially visible. While pre-trained vision-language models have shown
effectiveness in Re-ID tasks, they face significant challenges in occluded
scenarios by focusing on holistic image semantics while neglecting fine-grained
attribute information. This limitation becomes particularly evident when
dealing with partially occluded pedestrians or when distinguishing between
individuals with subtle appearance differences. To address this limitation, we
propose Attribute-Guide ReID (AG-ReID), a novel framework that leverages
pre-trained models' inherent capabilities to extract fine-grained semantic
attributes without additional data or annotations. Our framework operates
through a two-stage process: first generating attribute pseudo-labels that
capture subtle visual characteristics, then introducing a dual-guidance
mechanism that combines holistic and fine-grained attribute information to
enhance image feature extraction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
AG-ReID achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple widely-used Re-ID
datasets, showing significant improvements in handling occlusions and subtle
attribute differences while maintaining competitive performance on standard
Re-ID scenarios.

Motivation: 解决视频持续学习中高内存需求的问题，尤其是长视频和连续数据流对存储的挑战。

Method: 采用压缩视觉技术存储视频编码而非原始数据，并通过动态刷新编码来应对灾难性遗忘问题。

Result: 在EpicKitchens-100和Kinetics-700数据集上，CRAM方法以显著减少的内存占用优于现有技术。

Conclusion: CRAM方法为视频持续学习提供了一种高效且内存友好的解决方案。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) promises to allow neural networks to learn from
continuous streams of inputs, instead of IID (independent and identically
distributed) sampling, which requires random access to a full dataset. This
would allow for much smaller storage requirements and self-sufficiency of
deployed systems that cope with natural distribution shifts, similarly to
biological learning. We focus on video CL employing a rehearsal-based approach,
which reinforces past samples from a memory buffer. We posit that part of the
reason why practical video CL is challenging is the high memory requirements of
video, further exacerbated by long-videos and continual streams, which are at
odds with the common rehearsal-buffer size constraints. To address this, we
propose to use compressed vision, i.e. store video codes (embeddings) instead
of raw inputs, and train a video classifier by IID sampling from this rolling
buffer. Training a video compressor online (so not depending on any pre-trained
networks) means that it is also subject to catastrophic forgetting. We propose
a scheme to deal with this forgetting by refreshing video codes, which requires
careful decompression with a previous version of the network and recompression
with a new one. We name our method Continually Refreshed Amodal Memory (CRAM).
We expand current video CL benchmarks to large-scale settings, namely
EpicKitchens-100 and Kinetics-700, storing thousands of relatively long videos
in under 2 GB, and demonstrate empirically that our video CL method outperforms
prior art with a significantly reduced memory footprint.

Conclusion: MCDRL通过因果驱动方法有效提升医学图像分割的领域泛化能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated remarkable
zero-shot capabilities in various computer vision tasks. However, their
application to medical imaging remains challenging due to the high variability
and complexity of medical data. Specifically, medical images often exhibit
significant domain shifts caused by various confounders, including equipment
differences, procedure artifacts, and imaging modes, which can lead to poor
generalization when models are applied to unseen domains. To address this
limitation, we propose Multimodal Causal-Driven Representation Learning
(MCDRL), a novel framework that integrates causal inference with the VLM to
tackle domain generalization in medical image segmentation. MCDRL is
implemented in two steps: first, it leverages CLIP's cross-modal capabilities
to identify candidate lesion regions and construct a confounder dictionary
through text prompts, specifically designed to represent domain-specific
variations; second, it trains a causal intervention network that utilizes this
dictionary to identify and eliminate the influence of these domain-specific
variations while preserving the anatomical structural information critical for
segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MCDRL consistently
outperforms competing methods, yielding superior segmentation accuracy and
exhibiting robust generalizability.

Conclusion: AU-IQA数据集填补了AI-UGC质量评估的空白，为未来研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: AI-based image enhancement techniques have been widely adopted in various
visual applications, significantly improving the perceptual quality of
user-generated content (UGC). However, the lack of specialized quality
assessment models has become a significant limiting factor in this field,
limiting user experience and hindering the advancement of enhancement methods.
While perceptual quality assessment methods have shown strong performance on
UGC and AIGC individually, their effectiveness on AI-enhanced UGC (AI-UGC)
which blends features from both, remains largely unexplored. To address this
gap, we construct AU-IQA, a benchmark dataset comprising 4,800 AI-UGC images

*Sadia Kamal,Tim Oates,Joy Wan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 皮肤癌是全球最常见的癌症，每年医疗支出超过80亿美元。早期诊断和准确及时的治疗对提高患者生存率至关重要。临床中，医生使用SOAP笔记记录患者就诊情况，但手动生成这些笔记耗时且易导致医生疲劳。本文提出skin-SOAP，一种弱监督多模态框架，从有限的输入（如病变图像和稀疏临床文本）生成结构化SOAP笔记，减少对人工标注的依赖，同时减轻医生负担。该方法在关键临床相关性指标上表现与GPT-4o、Claude和DeepSeek Janus Pro相当。

Motivation: 解决手动生成SOAP笔记的高耗时性和医生负担问题，同时减少对大量标注数据的依赖。

Method: 提出skin-SOAP，一种弱监督多模态框架，利用病变图像和稀疏临床文本生成结构化SOAP笔记。

Result: 在临床相关性指标上表现与GPT-4o、Claude和DeepSeek Janus Pro相当，并引入MedConceptEval和CCS两个新指标评估语义对齐和临床一致性。

Conclusion: skin-SOAP能有效减轻医生负担，减少对人工标注的依赖，同时保持临床相关性。

Abstract: Skin carcinoma is the most prevalent form of cancer globally, accounting for
over $8 billion in annual healthcare expenditures. Early diagnosis, accurate
and timely treatment are critical to improving patient survival rates. In
clinical settings, physicians document patient visits using detailed SOAP
(Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan) notes. However, manually
generating these notes is labor-intensive and contributes to clinician burnout.
In this work, we propose skin-SOAP, a weakly supervised multimodal framework to
generate clinically structured SOAP notes from limited inputs, including lesion
images and sparse clinical text. Our approach reduces reliance on manual
annotations, enabling scalable, clinically grounded documentation while
alleviating clinician burden and reducing the need for large annotated data.
Our method achieves performance comparable to GPT-4o, Claude, and DeepSeek
Janus Pro across key clinical relevance metrics. To evaluate this clinical
relevance, we introduce two novel metrics MedConceptEval and Clinical Coherence
Score (CCS) which assess semantic alignment with expert medical concepts and
input features, respectively.

*Md Redwanul Haque,Manzur Murshed,Manoranjan Paul,Tsz-Kwan Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的图像质量评估方法SCSSIM，专注于场景构图结构（SCS）的完整性，解决了传统方法在结构评估上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI模型的快速发展需要超越人类感知的图像质量评估方法，尤其是确保场景构图结构的完整性。

Method: SCSSIM是一种无需训练的解析性度量，通过图像的立方体层次分区统计量来量化SCS的保持情况。

Result: 实验表明SCSSIM对非构图失真具有高不变性，而对构图失真表现出单调递减，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SCSSIM是评估生成模型场景构图完整性的有力工具。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI models necessitates novel methods for
evaluating image quality that extend beyond human perception. A critical
concern for these models is the preservation of an image's underlying Scene
Composition Structure (SCS), which defines the geometric relationships among
objects and the background, their relative positions, sizes, orientations, etc.
Maintaining SCS integrity is paramount for ensuring faithful and structurally
accurate GenAI outputs. Traditional image similarity metrics often fall short
in assessing SCS. Pixel-level approaches are overly sensitive to minor visual
noise, while perception-based metrics prioritize human aesthetic appeal,
neither adequately capturing structural fidelity. Furthermore, recent
neural-network-based metrics introduce training overheads and potential
generalization issues. We introduce the SCS Similarity Index Measure (SCSSIM),
a novel, analytical, and training-free metric that quantifies SCS preservation
by exploiting statistical measures derived from the Cuboidal hierarchical
partitioning of images, robustly capturing non-object-based structural
relationships. Our experiments demonstrate SCSSIM's high invariance to
non-compositional distortions, accurately reflecting unchanged SCS. Conversely,
it shows a strong monotonic decrease for compositional distortions, precisely
indicating when SCS has been altered. Compared to existing metrics, SCSSIM
exhibits superior properties for structural evaluation, making it an invaluable
tool for developing and evaluating generative models, ensuring the integrity of
scene composition.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为HAMoBE的新框架，通过分层和自适应混合生物特征专家，显著提升了视频行人重识别的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频行人重识别方法未能有效选择和识别查询-图库对中最具区分性的特征，导致匹配效果不佳。

Method: HAMoBE框架利用预训练大模型（如CLIP）的多层特征，模拟人类感知机制，独立建模关键生物特征（外观、静态体型、动态步态）并自适应整合。

Result: 在MEVID等基准测试中，HAMoBE实现了显著性能提升（如Rank-1准确率提高13.0%）。

Conclusion: HAMoBE通过分层和自适应特征整合，有效解决了视频行人重识别中的特征选择问题，提升了匹配性能。

Abstract: Recently, research interest in person re-identification (ReID) has
increasingly focused on video-based scenarios, which are essential for robust
surveillance and security in varied and dynamic environments. However, existing
video-based ReID methods often overlook the necessity of identifying and
selecting the most discriminative features from both videos in a query-gallery
pair for effective matching. To address this issue, we propose a novel
Hierarchical and Adaptive Mixture of Biometric Experts (HAMoBE) framework,
which leverages multi-layer features from a pre-trained large model (e.g.,
CLIP) and is designed to mimic human perceptual mechanisms by independently
modeling key biometric features--appearance, static body shape, and dynamic
gait--and adaptively integrating them. Specifically, HAMoBE includes two
levels: the first level extracts low-level features from multi-layer
representations provided by the frozen large model, while the second level
consists of specialized experts focusing on long-term, short-term, and temporal
features. To ensure robust matching, we introduce a new dual-input decision
gating network that dynamically adjusts the contributions of each expert based
on their relevance to the input scenarios. Extensive evaluations on benchmarks
like MEVID demonstrate that our approach yields significant performance
improvements (e.g., +13.0% Rank-1 accuracy).

TL;DR: 论文提出了NiM基准和Spot-IT方法，用于评估和改进多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在复杂文档中定位和推理细粒度细节的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MLLMs在复杂文档中处理细粒度细节的能力尚未充分研究，需要一种方法来评估和改进这种能力。

Method: 引入NiM基准，并提出Spot-IT方法，通过智能补丁选择和高斯注意力增强MLLMs的能力。

Result: 实验显示Spot-IT在复杂布局中提取精确细节时显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: Spot-IT有效提升了MLLMs在细粒度文档理解任务中的表现，揭示了当前模型的局限性。

Abstract: While Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown impressive
capabilities in document understanding tasks, their ability to locate and
reason about fine-grained details within complex documents remains
understudied. Consider searching a restaurant menu for a specific nutritional
detail or identifying a disclaimer in a lengthy newspaper article tasks that
demand careful attention to small but significant details within a broader
narrative, akin to Finding Needles in Images (NiM). To address this gap, we
introduce NiM, a carefully curated benchmark spanning diverse real-world
documents including newspapers, menus, and lecture images, specifically
designed to evaluate MLLMs' capability in these intricate tasks. Building on
this, we further propose Spot-IT, a simple yet effective approach that enhances
MLLMs capability through intelligent patch selection and Gaussian attention,
motivated from how humans zoom and focus when searching documents. Our
extensive experiments reveal both the capabilities and limitations of current
MLLMs in handling fine-grained document understanding tasks, while
demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. Spot-IT achieves significant
improvements over baseline methods, particularly in scenarios requiring precise
detail extraction from complex layouts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在估计PBR材料时难以同时优化反照率和金属粗糙度，尤其是在复杂光照条件下。

Method: DualMat通过两条路径操作：一条在RGB潜在空间中优化反照率，另一条在紧凑潜在空间中精确估计金属粗糙度，并通过特征蒸馏确保一致性。使用整流流提高效率。

Result: 在Objaverse和真实数据上表现最佳，反照率估计提升28%，金属粗糙度预测误差减少39%。

Conclusion: DualMat通过双路径设计和特征蒸馏，显著提升了PBR材料估计的精度和效率。

Abstract: We present DualMat, a novel dual-path diffusion framework for estimating
Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials from single images under complex
lighting conditions. Our approach operates in two distinct latent spaces: an
albedo-optimized path leveraging pretrained visual knowledge through RGB latent
space, and a material-specialized path operating in a compact latent space
designed for precise metallic and roughness estimation. To ensure coherent
predictions between the albedo-optimized and material-specialized paths, we
introduce feature distillation during training. We employ rectified flow to
enhance efficiency by reducing inference steps while maintaining quality. Our
framework extends to high-resolution and multi-view inputs through patch-based
estimation and cross-view attention, enabling seamless integration into
image-to-3D pipelines. DualMat achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
Objaverse and real-world data, significantly outperforming existing methods
with up to 28% improvement in albedo estimation and 39% reduction in
metallic-roughness prediction errors.

TL;DR: DecoupleCSS提出了一种两阶段框架，通过解耦类别感知检测和类别无关分割，解决了持续语义分割中的灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CSS方法通常采用单阶段编码器-解码器架构，导致新旧类别学习干扰和次优的保留-可塑性平衡。

Method: DecoupleCSS分为两阶段：第一阶段使用预训练文本和图像编码器生成位置感知提示；第二阶段利用SAM模型生成精确分割掩码。

Result: 该方法在多种挑战性任务中实现了最先进的性能，平衡了保留和适应性。

Conclusion: DecoupleCSS通过解耦策略有效解决了CSS中的灾难性遗忘问题，提升了性能。

Abstract: Continual Semantic Segmentation (CSS) requires learning new classes without
forgetting previously acquired knowledge, addressing the fundamental challenge
of catastrophic forgetting in dense prediction tasks. However, existing CSS
methods typically employ single-stage encoder-decoder architectures where
segmentation masks and class labels are tightly coupled, leading to
interference between old and new class learning and suboptimal
retention-plasticity balance. We introduce DecoupleCSS, a novel two-stage
framework for CSS. By decoupling class-aware detection from class-agnostic
segmentation, DecoupleCSS enables more effective continual learning, preserving
past knowledge while learning new classes. The first stage leverages
pre-trained text and image encoders, adapted using LoRA, to encode
class-specific information and generate location-aware prompts. In the second
stage, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) is employed to produce precise
segmentation masks, ensuring that segmentation knowledge is shared across both
new and previous classes. This approach improves the balance between retention
and adaptability in CSS, achieving state-of-the-art performance across a
variety of challenging tasks. Our code is publicly available at:

Motivation: 图像着色任务因其在颜色恢复和自动动画着色等领域的应用而备受关注，但由于其高度不适定性，需要利用场景语义和纹理等线索。

Result: 未明确提及具体结果，但强调了方法的改进和比较。

Conclusion: 通过分类和对抗学习改进图像着色任务，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Image colorization, the task of adding colors to grayscale images, has been
the focus of significant research efforts in computer vision in recent years
for its various application areas such as color restoration and automatic
animation colorization [15, 1]. The colorization problem is challenging as it
is highly ill-posed with two out of three image dimensions lost, resulting in
large degrees of freedom. However, semantics of the scene as well as the
surface texture could provide important cues for colors: the sky is typically
blue, the clouds are typically white and the grass is typically green, and
there are huge amounts of training data available for learning such priors
since any colored image could serve as a training data point [20].
  Colorization is initially formulated as a regression task[5], which ignores
the multi-modal nature of color prediction. In this project, we explore
automatic image colorization via classification and adversarial learning. We
will build our models on prior works, apply modifications for our specific
scenario and make comparisons.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GAN和扩散方法依赖额外组件或算法来平衡迁移质量和身份一致性，但易引入额外误差，导致效果不佳。

Method: 基于FLUX-Kontext框架，直接以源图像为条件输入，并引入轻量级RefLoRAInjector解耦参考路径，同时设计了高效数据生成管道。

Result: 实验表明FLUX-Makeup在多样场景中表现鲁棒，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FLUX-Makeup通过简化框架和优化数据生成，实现了高保真、身份一致的化妆迁移。

Abstract: Makeup transfer aims to apply the makeup style from a reference face to a
target face and has been increasingly adopted in practical applications.
Existing GAN-based approaches typically rely on carefully designed loss
functions to balance transfer quality and facial identity consistency, while
diffusion-based methods often depend on additional face-control modules or
algorithms to preserve identity. However, these auxiliary components tend to
introduce extra errors, leading to suboptimal transfer results. To overcome
these limitations, we propose FLUX-Makeup, a high-fidelity,
identity-consistent, and robust makeup transfer framework that eliminates the
need for any auxiliary face-control components. Instead, our method directly
leverages source-reference image pairs to achieve superior transfer
performance. Specifically, we build our framework upon FLUX-Kontext, using the
source image as its native conditional input. Furthermore, we introduce
RefLoRAInjector, a lightweight makeup feature injector that decouples the
reference pathway from the backbone, enabling efficient and comprehensive
extraction of makeup-related information. In parallel, we design a robust and
scalable data generation pipeline to provide more accurate supervision during
training. The paired makeup datasets produced by this pipeline significantly
surpass the quality of all existing datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that FLUX-Makeup achieves state-of-the-art performance, exhibiting strong
robustness across diverse scenarios.

Motivation: PFMs在自监督预训练中表现出强大的表征能力，但其预训练背景的多样性和不透明性引入了潜在偏差，限制了泛化性和透明度。

Method: 提出AdaFusion框架，压缩和对齐来自不同模型的瓦片级特征，并基于组织表型上下文自适应融合。

Result: 在三个真实世界基准测试中，AdaFusion在分类和回归任务中均优于单个PFM，并提供模型生物语义专业化的可解释性。

Conclusion: AdaFusion能够桥接异构PFMs，既提升性能又增强模型特定归纳偏差的可解释性。

Abstract: Pathology foundation models (PFMs) have demonstrated strong representational
capabilities through self-supervised pre-training on large-scale, unannotated
histopathology image datasets. However, their diverse yet opaque pretraining
contexts, shaped by both data-related and structural/training factors,
introduce latent biases that hinder generalisability and transparency in
downstream applications. In this paper, we propose AdaFusion, a novel
prompt-guided inference framework that, to our knowledge, is among the very
first to dynamically integrate complementary knowledge from multiple PFMs. Our
method compresses and aligns tile-level features from diverse models and
employs a lightweight attention mechanism to adaptively fuse them based on
tissue phenotype context. We evaluate AdaFusion on three real-world benchmarks
spanning treatment response prediction, tumour grading, and spatial gene
expression inference. Our approach consistently surpasses individual PFMs
across both classification and regression tasks, while offering interpretable
insights into each model's biosemantic specialisation. These results highlight
AdaFusion's ability to bridge heterogeneous PFMs, achieving both enhanced
performance and interpretability of model-specific inductive biases.

TL;DR: PoseGen是一个新框架，通过单张参考图像和驱动姿态序列生成任意长度的视频，解决了扩散模型在身份漂移和短片段限制上的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前扩散模型在生成长视频时存在身份漂移和片段限制的问题，需要一种能精确控制身份和运动的方法。

Method: 采用in-context LoRA微调策略，在token级别注入身份信息，同时在通道级别控制姿态信息，并通过分段生成和共享KV缓存机制实现无缝拼接。

Result: PoseGen在身份保真度、姿态准确性和生成无限时长视频方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PoseGen通过创新的微调和分段生成方法，成功解决了长视频生成中的身份漂移和片段限制问题。

Abstract: Generating long, temporally coherent videos with precise control over subject
identity and motion is a formidable challenge for current diffusion models,
which often suffer from identity drift and are limited to short clips. We
introduce PoseGen, a novel framework that generates arbitrarily long videos of
a specific subject from a single reference image and a driving pose sequence.
Our core innovation is an in-context LoRA finetuning strategy that injects
subject appearance at the token level for identity preservation, while
simultaneously conditioning on pose information at the channel level for
fine-grained motion control. To overcome duration limits, PoseGen pioneers an
interleaved segment generation method that seamlessly stitches video clips
together, using a shared KV cache mechanism and a specialized transition
process to ensure background consistency and temporal smoothness. Trained on a
remarkably small 33-hour video dataset, extensive experiments show that PoseGen
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identity fidelity, pose
accuracy, and its unique ability to produce coherent, artifact-free videos of
unlimited duration.

TL;DR: SMP（Sculpting Margin Penalty）是一种新型的FSCIL方法，通过在不同阶段策略性地整合边际惩罚，解决了基类判别性和新类泛化性的平衡问题。


<details>

Motivation: 现实应用中数据隐私和获取成本高，导致增量任务中训练数据不足，性能下降。现有方法难以平衡基类判别性和新类泛化性。

Method: SMP引入MIAM机制（基任务学习）和MPCC策略（增量任务），分别通过边际惩罚优化基类判别性和决策边界。

Result: 在CIFAR100、ImageNet-R和CUB200上的实验表明，SMP在FSCIL中达到最优性能，平衡了基类和新类。

Conclusion: SMP通过边际惩罚策略有效提升FSCIL性能，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Real-world applications often face data privacy constraints and high
acquisition costs, making the assumption of sufficient training data in
incremental tasks unrealistic and leading to significant performance
degradation in class-incremental learning. Forward-compatible learning, which
prospectively prepares for future tasks during base task training, has emerged
as a promising solution for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL).
However, existing methods still struggle to balance base-class discriminability
and new-class generalization. Moreover, limited access to original data during
incremental tasks often results in ambiguous inter-class decision boundaries.
To address these challenges, we propose SMP (Sculpting Margin Penalty), a novel
FSCIL method that strategically integrates margin penalties at different stages
within the parameter-efficient fine-tuning paradigm. Specifically, we introduce
the Margin-aware Intra-task Adapter Merging (MIAM) mechanism for base task
learning. MIAM trains two sets of low-rank adapters with distinct
classification losses: one with a margin penalty to enhance base-class
discriminability, and the other without margin constraints to promote
generalization to future new classes. These adapters are then adaptively merged
to improve forward compatibility. For incremental tasks, we propose a Margin
Penalty-based Classifier Calibration (MPCC) strategy to refine decision
boundaries by fine-tuning classifiers on all seen classes' embeddings with a
margin penalty. Extensive experiments on CIFAR100, ImageNet-R, and CUB200
demonstrate that SMP achieves state-of-the-art performance in FSCIL while
maintaining a better balance between base and new classes.

TL;DR: AHDMIL框架通过两步训练过程快速分类病理图像，减少计算成本，提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多实例学习（MIL）在病理图像分类中计算成本高，需处理大量图像块。

Method: 提出AHDMIL框架，包含DMIN和DB-LIPN网络，通过自蒸馏和非对称蒸馏两步训练筛选无关图像块。

Result: 在四个数据集上表现优于现有方法，准确率提升5.3%，推理速度加快1.2倍。

Conclusion: AHDMIL在分类性能和推理速度上均显著提升，适用于高效病理图像分析。

Abstract: Although multi-instance learning (MIL) has succeeded in pathological image
classification, it faces the challenge of high inference costs due to the need
to process thousands of patches from each gigapixel whole slide image (WSI). To
address this, we propose AHDMIL, an Asymmetric Hierarchical Distillation
Multi-Instance Learning framework that enables fast and accurate classification
by eliminating irrelevant patches through a two-step training process. AHDMIL
comprises two key components: the Dynamic Multi-Instance Network (DMIN), which
operates on high-resolution WSIs, and the Dual-Branch Lightweight Instance
Pre-screening Network (DB-LIPN), which analyzes corresponding low-resolution
counterparts. In the first step, self-distillation (SD), DMIN is trained for
WSI classification while generating per-instance attention scores to identify
irrelevant patches. These scores guide the second step, asymmetric distillation
(AD), where DB-LIPN learns to predict the relevance of each low-resolution
patch. The relevant patches predicted by DB-LIPN have spatial correspondence
with patches in high-resolution WSIs, which are used for fine-tuning and
efficient inference of DMIN. In addition, we design the first
Chebyshev-polynomial-based Kolmogorov-Arnold (CKA) classifier in computational
pathology, which improves classification performance through learnable
activation layers. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate
that AHDMIL consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in both
classification performance and inference speed. For example, on the Camelyon16
dataset, it achieves a relative improvement of 5.3% in accuracy and accelerates
inference by 1.2.times. Across all datasets, area under the curve (AUC),
accuracy, f1 score, and brier score show consistent gains, with average
inference speedups ranging from 1.2 to 2.1 times. The code is available.

Motivation: 现有方法仅依赖单一文本输入，无法充分利用视觉细节，容易导致目标误识别。

Result: 在多个基准测试中优于现有方法，并在广义引用表达分割（GRES）基准上表现突出。

Conclusion: 通过多潜在表达和对比学习，显著提升了视觉定位任务的性能。

Abstract: Visual grounding tasks, such as referring image segmentation (RIS) and
referring expression comprehension (REC), aim to localize a target object based
on a given textual description. The target object in an image can be described
in multiple ways, reflecting diverse attributes such as color, position, and
more. However, most existing methods rely on a single textual input, which
captures only a fraction of the rich information available in the visual
domain. This mismatch between rich visual details and sparse textual cues can
lead to the misidentification of similar objects. To address this, we propose a
novel visual grounding framework that leverages multiple latent expressions
generated from a single textual input by incorporating complementary visual
details absent from the original description. Specifically, we introduce
subject distributor and visual concept injector modules to embed both
shared-subject and distinct-attributes concepts into the latent
representations, thereby capturing unique and target-specific visual cues. We
also propose a positive-margin contrastive learning strategy to align all
latent expressions with the original text while preserving subtle variations.
Experimental results show that our method not only outperforms state-of-the-art
RIS and REC approaches on multiple benchmarks but also achieves outstanding
performance on the generalized referring expression segmentation (GRES)
benchmark.

Motivation: 解决医学图像分割中数据稀缺、模态间域偏移和隐私限制等问题，开发一种能泛化到多模态的统一模型。

Method: 提出FedGIN框架，集成GIN模块以协调模态间强度分布，在联邦学习环境下训练模型，评估了有限数据集和完整数据集两种场景。

Result: 在有限数据场景中，FedGIN比无GIN的联邦学习提升12-18%的3D Dice分数；在完整数据场景中，性能接近集中式训练，跨模态泛化能力显著。

Conclusion: FedGIN在隐私保护下实现了高效的多模态医学图像分割，为临床工作流提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in AI-assisted diagnostics,
surgical planning, and treatment monitoring. Accurate and robust segmentation
models are essential for enabling reliable, data-driven clinical decision
making across diverse imaging modalities. Given the inherent variability in
image characteristics across modalities, developing a unified model capable of
generalizing effectively to multiple modalities would be highly beneficial.
This model could streamline clinical workflows and reduce the need for
modality-specific training. However, real-world deployment faces major
challenges, including data scarcity, domain shift between modalities (e.g., CT
vs. MRI), and privacy restrictions that prevent data sharing. To address these
issues, we propose FedGIN, a Federated Learning (FL) framework that enables
multimodal organ segmentation without sharing raw patient data. Our method
integrates a lightweight Global Intensity Non-linear (GIN) augmentation module
that harmonizes modality-specific intensity distributions during local
training. We evaluated FedGIN using two types of datasets: an imputed dataset
and a complete dataset. In the limited dataset scenario, the model was
initially trained using only MRI data, and CT data was added to assess its
performance improvements. In the complete dataset scenario, both MRI and CT
data were fully utilized for training on all clients. In the limited-data
scenario, FedGIN achieved a 12 to 18% improvement in 3D Dice scores on MRI test
cases compared to FL without GIN and consistently outperformed local baselines.
In the complete dataset scenario, FedGIN demonstrated near-centralized
performance, with a 30% Dice score improvement over the MRI-only baseline and a
10% improvement over the CT-only baseline, highlighting its strong
cross-modality generalization under privacy constraints.

Abstract: Assessing chronic pain behavior in mice is critical for preclinical studies.
However, existing methods mostly rely on manual labeling of behavioral
features, and humans lack a clear understanding of which behaviors best
represent chronic pain. For this reason, existing methods struggle to
accurately capture the insidious and persistent behavioral changes in chronic
pain. This study proposes a framework to automatically discover features
related to chronic pain without relying on human-defined action labels. Our
method uses universal action space projector to automatically extract mouse
action features, and avoids the potential bias of human labeling by retaining
the rich behavioral information in the original video. In this paper, we also
collected a mouse pain behavior dataset that captures the disease progression
of both neuropathic and inflammatory pain across multiple time points. Our
method achieves 48.41\% accuracy in a 15-class pain classification task,
significantly outperforming human experts (21.33\%) and the widely used method
B-SOiD (30.52\%). Furthermore, when the classification is simplified to only
three categories, i.e., neuropathic pain, inflammatory pain, and no pain, then
our method achieves an accuracy of 73.1\%, which is notably higher than that of
human experts (48\%) and B-SOiD (58.43\%). Finally, our method revealed
differences in drug efficacy for different types of pain on zero-shot
Gabapentin drug testing, and the results were consistent with past drug
efficacy literature. This study demonstrates the potential clinical application
of our method, which can provide new insights into pain research and related
drug development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低分辨率图像中几何模式（如纹理、边缘）变形导致的超分辨率恢复问题，通过嵌入旋转等变性保持原始结构的完整性。

Method: 重新设计编码器和隐式神经表示（INR）模块，引入旋转等变性能力，并进行理论分析验证其内在等变性误差。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据集上验证了方法的优越性，并可无缝集成到现有ASISR方法中提升性能。

Conclusion: 提出的旋转等变ASISR方法有效解决了几何模式变形问题，为图像超分辨率提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: The arbitrary-scale image super-resolution (ASISR), a recent popular topic in
computer vision, aims to achieve arbitrary-scale high-resolution recoveries
from a low-resolution input image. This task is realized by representing the
image as a continuous implicit function through two fundamental modules, a
deep-network-based encoder and an implicit neural representation (INR) module.
Despite achieving notable progress, a crucial challenge of such a highly
ill-posed setting is that many common geometric patterns, such as repetitive
textures, edges, or shapes, are seriously warped and deformed in the
low-resolution images, naturally leading to unexpected artifacts appearing in
their high-resolution recoveries. Embedding rotation equivariance into the
ASISR network is thus necessary, as it has been widely demonstrated that this
enhancement enables the recovery to faithfully maintain the original
orientations and structural integrity of geometric patterns underlying the
input image. Motivated by this, we make efforts to construct a rotation
equivariant ASISR method in this study. Specifically, we elaborately redesign
the basic architectures of INR and encoder modules, incorporating intrinsic
rotation equivariance capabilities beyond those of conventional ASISR networks.
Through such amelioration, the ASISR network can, for the first time, be
implemented with end-to-end rotational equivariance maintained from input to
output. We also provide a solid theoretical analysis to evaluate its intrinsic
equivariance error, demonstrating its inherent nature of embedding such an
equivariance structure. The superiority of the proposed method is substantiated
by experiments conducted on both simulated and real datasets. We also validate
that the proposed framework can be readily integrated into current ASISR
methods in a plug \& play manner to further enhance their performance.

TL;DR: X-MoGen是一个统一的跨物种文本驱动运动生成框架，结合人类和动物运动，通过两阶段架构和形态一致性模块解决形态差异问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常单独建模人类和动物运动，而跨物种联合方法能提供统一表示和更好的泛化能力，但形态差异仍是挑战。

Method: X-MoGen采用两阶段架构：1）学习T-pose先验和共享潜在空间；2）基于文本描述的掩码运动建模。形态一致性模块确保骨骼合理性。

Result: 在UniMo4D数据集上，X-MoGen在已知和未知物种上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: X-MoGen首次实现了人类和动物的统一文本驱动运动生成，并通过形态一致性模块和联合训练提升了性能。

Abstract: Text-driven motion generation has attracted increasing attention due to its
broad applications in virtual reality, animation, and robotics. While existing
methods typically model human and animal motion separately, a joint
cross-species approach offers key advantages, such as a unified representation
and improved generalization. However, morphological differences across species
remain a key challenge, often compromising motion plausibility. To address
this, we propose \textbf{X-MoGen}, the first unified framework for
cross-species text-driven motion generation covering both humans and animals.
X-MoGen adopts a two-stage architecture. First, a conditional graph variational
autoencoder learns canonical T-pose priors, while an autoencoder encodes motion
into a shared latent space regularized by morphological loss. In the second
stage, we perform masked motion modeling to generate motion embeddings
conditioned on textual descriptions. During training, a morphological
consistency module is employed to promote skeletal plausibility across species.
To support unified modeling, we construct \textbf{UniMo4D}, a large-scale
dataset of 115 species and 119k motion sequences, which integrates human and
animal motions under a shared skeletal topology for joint training. Extensive
experiments on UniMo4D demonstrate that X-MoGen outperforms state-of-the-art
methods on both seen and unseen species.

Motivation: 现有对抗补丁方法主要针对目标检测模型，在MLLM系统中表现不佳，需专门设计以应对其复杂架构和推理能力。

Method: PhysPatch结合语义掩码初始化、SVD局部对齐损失和势场掩码优化，提升补丁的物理可行性和迁移性。

Result: 实验表明，PhysPatch在多种MLLM上显著优于现有方法，能有效引导AD系统的感知和规划输出。

Conclusion: PhysPatch在物理可行区域放置对抗补丁，确保实际适用性和部署性，为MLLM安全性研究提供新方向。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are becoming integral to autonomous
driving (AD) systems due to their strong vision-language reasoning
capabilities. However, MLLMs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
particularly adversarial patch attacks, which can pose serious threats in
real-world scenarios. Existing patch-based attack methods are primarily
designed for object detection models and perform poorly when transferred to
MLLM-based systems due to the latter's complex architectures and reasoning
abilities. To address these limitations, we propose PhysPatch, a physically
realizable and transferable adversarial patch framework tailored for MLLM-based
AD systems. PhysPatch jointly optimizes patch location, shape, and content to
enhance attack effectiveness and real-world applicability. It introduces a
semantic-based mask initialization strategy for realistic placement, an
SVD-based local alignment loss with patch-guided crop-resize to improve
transferability, and a potential field-based mask refinement method. Extensive
experiments across open-source, commercial, and reasoning-capable MLLMs
demonstrate that PhysPatch significantly outperforms prior methods in steering
MLLM-based AD systems toward target-aligned perception and planning outputs.
Moreover, PhysPatch consistently places adversarial patches in physically
feasible regions of AD scenes, ensuring strong real-world applicability and
deployability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中，未见类别的目标常因低置信度检测、弱运动与外观约束及长期遮挡等问题挑战现有方法。

Method: MTT框架首先根据短时空相关性自适应聚类检测结果生成鲁棒轨迹，然后利用位置和外观等多线索估计最佳轨迹分区以减少长期关联中的错误传播。

Result: 在通用多目标跟踪基准上的大量实验证明了该框架的竞争力。

Conclusion: MTT通过轨迹增强和多线索关联有效解决了未见类别目标的跟踪问题。

Abstract: Tracking specific targets, such as pedestrians and vehicles, has been the
focus of recent vision-based multitarget tracking studies. However, in some
real-world scenarios, unseen categories often challenge existing methods due to
low-confidence detections, weak motion and appearance constraints, and
long-term occlusions. To address these issues, this article proposes a
tracklet-enhanced tracker called Multi-Tracklet Tracking (MTT) that integrates
flexible tracklet generation into a multi-tracklet association framework. This
framework first adaptively clusters the detection results according to their
short-term spatio-temporal correlation into robust tracklets and then estimates
the best tracklet partitions using multiple clues, such as location and
appearance over time to mitigate error propagation in long-term association.
Finally, extensive experiments on the benchmark for generic multiple object
tracking demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposed framework.

Conclusion: SPA++通过谱对齐和一致性正则化，显著提升了领域自适应的性能。

Abstract: Domain Adaptation (DA) aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source
domain to an unlabeled or sparsely labeled target domain under domain shifts.
Most prior works focus on capturing the inter-domain transferability but
largely overlook rich intra-domain structures, which empirically results in
even worse discriminability. To tackle this tradeoff, we propose a generalized
graph SPectral Alignment framework, SPA++. Its core is briefly condensed as
follows: (1)-by casting the DA problem to graph primitives, it composes a
coarse graph alignment mechanism with a novel spectral regularizer toward
aligning the domain graphs in eigenspaces; (2)-we further develop a
fine-grained neighbor-aware propagation mechanism for enhanced discriminability
in the target domain; (3)-by incorporating data augmentation and consistency
regularization, SPA++ can adapt to complex scenarios including most DA settings
and even challenging distribution scenarios. Furthermore, we also provide
theoretical analysis to support our method, including the generalization bound
of graph-based DA and the role of spectral alignment and smoothing consistency.
Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SPA++ consistently
outperforms existing cutting-edge methods, achieving superior robustness and
adaptability across various challenging adaptation scenarios.

Conclusion: SPEX是首个专注于光谱遥感影像土地覆盖提取的多模态视觉语言模型，性能优越且解释性强。

Abstract: Spectral information has long been recognized as a critical cue in remote
sensing observations. Although numerous vision-language models have been
developed for pixel-level interpretation, spectral information remains
underutilized, resulting in suboptimal performance, particularly in
multispectral scenarios. To address this limitation, we construct a
vision-language instruction-following dataset named SPIE, which encodes
spectral priors of land-cover objects into textual attributes recognizable by
large language models (LLMs), based on classical spectral index computations.
Leveraging this dataset, we propose SPEX, a multimodal LLM designed for
instruction-driven land cover extraction. To this end, we introduce several
carefully designed components and training strategies, including multiscale
feature aggregation, token context condensation, and multispectral visual
pre-training, to achieve precise and flexible pixel-level interpretation. To
the best of our knowledge, SPEX is the first multimodal vision-language model
dedicated to land cover extraction in spectral remote sensing imagery.
Extensive experiments on five public multispectral datasets demonstrate that
SPEX consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in extracting
typical land cover categories such as vegetation, buildings, and water bodies.
Moreover, SPEX is capable of generating textual explanations for its
predictions, thereby enhancing interpretability and user-friendliness. Code

TL;DR: EndoMatcher提出了一种通过大规模多域数据预训练的通用内窥镜图像匹配方法，解决了视觉条件困难和数据稀缺问题，显著提升了匹配性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 内窥镜图像中的密集特征匹配对机器人辅助任务至关重要，但视觉条件困难（如弱纹理、大视角变化）和标注数据稀缺使其具有挑战性。

Method: EndoMatcher采用双分支Vision Transformer提取多尺度特征，并通过双交互块增强对应学习；构建了首个多域内窥镜匹配数据集Endo-Mix6，并提出渐进式多目标训练策略。

Result: 在零样本匹配实验中，EndoMatcher在Hamlyn和Bladder数据集上分别将匹配内点数量提升了140.69%和201.43%，在Gastro-Matching数据集上MDPA提升了9.40%。

Conclusion: EndoMatcher在挑战性内窥镜条件下实现了密集且准确的匹配，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Generalizable dense feature matching in endoscopic images is crucial for
robot-assisted tasks, including 3D reconstruction, navigation, and surgical
scene understanding. Yet, it remains a challenge due to difficult visual
conditions (e.g., weak textures, large viewpoint variations) and a scarcity of
annotated data. To address these challenges, we propose EndoMatcher, a
generalizable endoscopic image matcher via large-scale, multi-domain data
pre-training. To address difficult visual conditions, EndoMatcher employs a
two-branch Vision Transformer to extract multi-scale features, enhanced by dual
interaction blocks for robust correspondence learning. To overcome data
scarcity and improve domain diversity, we construct Endo-Mix6, the first
multi-domain dataset for endoscopic matching. Endo-Mix6 consists of
approximately 1.2M real and synthetic image pairs across six domains, with
correspondence labels generated using Structure-from-Motion and simulated
transformations. The diversity and scale of Endo-Mix6 introduce new challenges
in training stability due to significant variations in dataset sizes,
distribution shifts, and error imbalance. To address them, a progressive
multi-objective training strategy is employed to promote balanced learning and
improve representation quality across domains. This enables EndoMatcher to
generalize across unseen organs and imaging conditions in a zero-shot fashion.
Extensive zero-shot matching experiments demonstrate that EndoMatcher increases
the number of inlier matches by 140.69% and 201.43% on the Hamlyn and Bladder
datasets over state-of-the-art methods, respectively, and improves the Matching
Direction Prediction Accuracy (MDPA) by 9.40% on the Gastro-Matching dataset,
achieving dense and accurate matching under challenging endoscopic conditions.

Motivation: 大型多模态模型（LMMs）在视觉语言任务中表现优异，但过多的视觉令牌导致高计算成本，现有剪枝方法简单且性能下降明显。

Method: 提出VFlowOpt框架，包括基于注意力相关性和信息熵的重要性图生成、渐进式剪枝与回收机制，以及视觉信息流引导的剪枝策略优化。

Conclusion: VFlowOpt通过优化剪枝策略，显著降低计算成本，同时保持模型性能，适用于不同LMMs。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) excel in visual-language tasks by leveraging
numerous visual tokens for fine-grained visual information, but this token
redundancy results in significant computational costs. Previous research aimed
at reducing visual tokens during inference typically leverages importance maps
derived from attention scores among vision-only tokens or vision-language
tokens to prune tokens across one or multiple pruning stages. Despite this
progress, pruning frameworks and strategies remain simplistic and
insufficiently explored, often resulting in substantial performance
degradation. In this paper, we propose VFlowOpt, a token pruning framework that
introduces an importance map derivation process and a progressive pruning
module with a recycling mechanism. The hyperparameters of its pruning strategy
are further optimized by a visual information flow-guided method. Specifically,
we compute an importance map for image tokens based on their attention-derived
context relevance and patch-level information entropy. We then decide which
tokens to retain or prune and aggregate the pruned ones as recycled tokens to
avoid potential information loss. Finally, we apply a visual information
flow-guided method that regards the last token in the LMM as the most
representative signal of text-visual interactions. This method minimizes the
discrepancy between token representations in LMMs with and without pruning,
thereby enabling superior pruning strategies tailored to different LMMs.
Experiments demonstrate that VFlowOpt can prune 90% of visual tokens while
maintaining comparable performance, leading to an 89% reduction in KV-Cache
memory and 3.8 times faster inference.

Conclusion: 该方法在无需源域数据的情况下，通过多模态信息融合有效提升了跨域少样本分割性能。

Abstract: Few-Shot Segmentation(FSS) aims to efficient segmentation of new objects with
few labeled samples. However, its performance significantly degrades when
domain discrepancies exist between training and deployment. Cross-Domain
Few-Shot Segmentation(CD-FSS) is proposed to mitigate such performance
degradation. Current CD-FSS methods primarily sought to develop segmentation
models on a source domain capable of cross-domain generalization. However,
driven by escalating concerns over data privacy and the imperative to minimize
data transfer and training expenses, the development of source-free CD-FSS
approaches has become essential. In this work, we propose a source-free CD-FSS
method that leverages both textual and visual information to facilitate target
domain task adaptation without requiring source domain data. Specifically, we
first append Task-Specific Attention Adapters (TSAA) to the feature pyramid of
a pretrained backbone, which adapt multi-level features extracted from the
shared pre-trained backbone to the target task. Then, the parameters of the
TSAA are trained through a Visual-Visual Embedding Alignment (VVEA) module and
a Text-Visual Embedding Alignment (TVEA) module. The VVEA module utilizes
global-local visual features to align image features across different views,
while the TVEA module leverages textual priors from pre-aligned multi-modal
features (e.g., from CLIP) to guide cross-modal adaptation. By combining the
outputs of these modules through dense comparison operations and subsequent
fusion via skip connections, our method produces refined prediction masks.
Under both 1-shot and 5-shot settings, the proposed approach achieves average
segmentation accuracy improvements of 2.18\% and 4.11\%, respectively, across
four cross-domain datasets, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art CD-FSS
methods. Code are available at https://github.com/ljm198134/TVGTANet.

Conclusion: ReasoningTrack通过推理和语言生成优化，显著提升了视觉语言跟踪的性能，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Vision-language tracking has received increasing attention in recent years,
as textual information can effectively address the inflexibility and inaccuracy
associated with specifying the target object to be tracked. Existing works
either directly fuse the fixed language with vision features or simply modify
using attention, however, their performance is still limited. Recently, some
researchers have explored using text generation to adapt to the variations in
the target during tracking, however, these works fail to provide insights into
the model's reasoning process and do not fully leverage the advantages of large
models, which further limits their overall performance. To address the
aforementioned issues, this paper proposes a novel reasoning-based
vision-language tracking framework, named ReasoningTrack, based on a
pre-trained vision-language model Qwen2.5-VL. Both SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning)
and reinforcement learning GRPO are used for the optimization of reasoning and
language generation. We embed the updated language descriptions and feed them
into a unified tracking backbone network together with vision features. Then,
we adopt a tracking head to predict the specific location of the target object.
In addition, we propose a large-scale long-term vision-language tracking
benchmark dataset, termed TNLLT, which contains 200 video sequences. 20
baseline visual trackers are re-trained and evaluated on this dataset, which
builds a solid foundation for the vision-language visual tracking task.
Extensive experiments on multiple vision-language tracking benchmark datasets
fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed reasoning-based natural
language generation strategy. The source code of this paper will be released on

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂工业场景中的气泡分割提供了高效解决方案，突破了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Segmenting gas bubbles in multiphase flows is a critical yet unsolved
challenge in numerous industrial settings, from metallurgical processing to
maritime drag reduction. Traditional approaches-and most recent learning-based
methods-assume near-spherical shapes, limiting their effectiveness in regimes
where bubbles undergo deformation, coalescence, or breakup. This complexity is
particularly evident in air lubrication systems, where coalesced bubbles form
amorphous and topologically diverse patches. In this work, we revisit the
problem through the lens of modern vision foundation models. We cast the task
as a transfer learning problem and demonstrate, for the first time, that a
fine-tuned Segment Anything Model SAM v2.1 can accurately segment highly
non-convex, irregular bubble structures using as few as 100 annotated images.

Conclusion: Arbiviewgen为自动驾驶中的任意视角图像生成提供了高效且无需额外数据的解决方案。

Abstract: Arbitrary viewpoint image generation holds significant potential for
autonomous driving, yet remains a challenging task due to the lack of
ground-truth data for extrapolated views, which hampers the training of
high-fidelity generative models. In this work, we propose Arbiviewgen, a novel
diffusion-based framework for the generation of controllable camera images from
arbitrary points of view. To address the absence of ground-truth data in unseen
views, we introduce two key components: Feature-Aware Adaptive View Stitching
(FAVS) and Cross-View Consistency Self-Supervised Learning (CVC-SSL). FAVS
employs a hierarchical matching strategy that first establishes coarse
geometric correspondences using camera poses, then performs fine-grained
alignment through improved feature matching algorithms, and identifies
high-confidence matching regions via clustering analysis. Building upon this,
CVC-SSL adopts a self-supervised training paradigm where the model reconstructs
the original camera views from the synthesized stitched images using a
diffusion model, enforcing cross-view consistency without requiring supervision
from extrapolated data. Our framework requires only multi-camera images and
their associated poses for training, eliminating the need for additional
sensors or depth maps. To our knowledge, Arbiviewgen is the first method
capable of controllable arbitrary view camera image generation in multiple
vehicle configurations.

Abstract: This report synthesizes eight seminal papers on the zero-shot adversarial
robustness of vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP. A central challenge in
this domain is the inherent trade-off between enhancing adversarial robustness
and preserving the model's zero-shot generalization capabilities. We analyze
two primary defense paradigms: Adversarial Fine-Tuning (AFT), which modifies
model parameters, and Training-Free/Test-Time Defenses, which preserve them. We
trace the evolution from alignment-preserving methods (TeCoA) to embedding
space re-engineering (LAAT, TIMA), and from input heuristics (AOM, TTC) to
latent-space purification (CLIPure). Finally, we identify key challenges and
future directions including hybrid defense strategies and adversarial
pre-training.

Abstract: Medical image understanding plays a crucial role in enabling automated
diagnosis and data-driven clinical decision support. However, its progress is
impeded by two primary challenges: the limited availability of high-quality
annotated medical data and an overreliance on global image features, which
often miss subtle but clinically significant pathological regions. To address
these issues, we introduce RegionMed-CLIP, a region-aware multimodal
contrastive learning framework that explicitly incorporates localized
pathological signals along with holistic semantic representations. The core of
our method is an innovative region-of-interest (ROI) processor that adaptively
integrates fine-grained regional features with the global context, supported by
a progressive training strategy that enhances hierarchical multimodal
alignment. To enable large-scale region-level representation learning, we
construct MedRegion-500k, a comprehensive medical image-text corpus that
features extensive regional annotations and multilevel clinical descriptions.
Extensive experiments on image-text retrieval, zero-shot classification, and
visual question answering tasks demonstrate that RegionMed-CLIP consistently
exceeds state-of-the-art vision language models by a wide margin. Our results
highlight the critical importance of region-aware contrastive pre-training and
position RegionMed-CLIP as a robust foundation for advancing multimodal medical
image understanding.

Abstract: Gender classification is attractive in a range of applications, including
surveillance and monitoring, corporate profiling, and human-computer
interaction. Individuals' identities may be gleaned from information about
their gender, which is a kind of soft biometric.Over the years, several methods
for determining a person's gender have been devised. Some of the most
well-known ones are based on physical characteristics like face, fingerprint,
palmprint, DNA, ears, gait, and iris. On the other hand, facial features
account for the vast majority of gender classification methods. Also, the iris
is a significant biometric trait because the iris, according to research,
remains basically constant during an individual's life. Besides that, the iris
is externally visible and is non-invasive to the user, which is important for
practical applications. Furthermore, there are already high-quality methods for
segmenting and encoding iris images, and the current methods facilitate
selecting and extracting attribute vectors from iris textures. This study
discusses several approaches to determining gender. The previous works of
literature are briefly reviewed. Additionally, there are a variety of
methodologies for different steps of gender classification. This study provides
researchers with knowledge and analysis of the existing gender classification
approaches. Also, it will assist researchers who are interested in this
specific area, as well as highlight the gaps and challenges in the field, and
finally provide suggestions and future paths for improvement.

Result: 实现了高效的3D特征场表示，仅需5%的高斯数量即可达到竞争性效果。

Conclusion: CF3方法在计算效率和几何细节保留方面表现优异。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has begun incorporating rich information from 2D
foundation models. However, most approaches rely on a bottom-up optimization
process that treats raw 2D features as ground truth, incurring increased
computational costs. We propose a top-down pipeline for constructing compact
and fast 3D Gaussian feature fields, namely, CF3. We first perform a fast
weighted fusion of multi-view 2D features with pre-trained Gaussians. This
approach enables training a per-Gaussian autoencoder directly on the lifted
features, instead of training autoencoders in the 2D domain. As a result, the
autoencoder better aligns with the feature distribution. More importantly, we
introduce an adaptive sparsification method that optimizes the Gaussian
attributes of the feature field while pruning and merging the redundant
Gaussians, constructing an efficient representation with preserved geometric
details. Our approach achieves a competitive 3D feature field using as little
as 5% of the Gaussians compared to Feature-3DGS.

Conclusion: SGDFuse为图像融合的核心挑战提供了强大解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion (IVIF) aims to combine the thermal
radiation information from infrared images with the rich texture details from
visible images to enhance perceptual capabilities for downstream visual tasks.
However, existing methods often fail to preserve key targets due to a lack of
deep semantic understanding of the scene, while the fusion process itself can
also introduce artifacts and detail loss, severely compromising both image
quality and task performance. To address these issues, this paper proposes
SGDFuse, a conditional diffusion model guided by the Segment Anything Model
(SAM), to achieve high-fidelity and semantically-aware image fusion. The core
of our method is to utilize high-quality semantic masks generated by SAM as
explicit priors to guide the optimization of the fusion process via a
conditional diffusion model. Specifically, the framework operates in a
two-stage process: it first performs a preliminary fusion of multi-modal
features, and then utilizes the semantic masks from SAM jointly with the
preliminary fused image as a condition to drive the diffusion model's
coarse-to-fine denoising generation. This ensures the fusion process not only
has explicit semantic directionality but also guarantees the high fidelity of
the final result. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SGDFuse achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both subjective and objective evaluations, as
well as in its adaptability to downstream tasks, providing a powerful solution
to the core challenges in image fusion. The code of SGDFuse is available at

Method: 引入B4DL基准，提出可扩展的数据生成流程和直接处理原始4D LiDAR的MLLM模型。

Result: 模型结合数据集与基准，为动态户外环境提供统一的时空推理解决方案。

Conclusion: B4DL填补了4D LiDAR在MLLM中的空白，推动了动态环境理解的研究。

Abstract: Understanding dynamic outdoor environments requires capturing complex object
interactions and their evolution over time. LiDAR-based 4D point clouds provide
precise spatial geometry and rich temporal cues, making them ideal for
representing real-world scenes. However, despite their potential, 4D LiDAR
remains underexplored in the context of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) due to the absence of high-quality, modality-specific annotations and
the lack of MLLM architectures capable of processing its high-dimensional
composition. To address these challenges, we introduce B4DL, a new benchmark
specifically designed for training and evaluating MLLMs on 4D LiDAR
understanding. In addition, we propose a scalable data generation pipeline and
an MLLM model that, for the first time, directly processes raw 4D LiDAR by
bridging it with language understanding. Combined with our dataset and
benchmark, our model offers a unified solution for spatio-temporal reasoning in
dynamic outdoor environments. We provide rendered 4D LiDAR videos, generated

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于小波变换的双频编码方法（WGDF），用于遥感图像中的变化检测，通过频域特征增强边缘细节和全局结构建模，显著提升了检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖空间域建模，特征表示多样性有限，难以捕捉细微变化区域。频域特征（尤其是小波域）可以放大频率分量的差异，增强边缘变化的感知。

Method: 使用离散小波变换（DWT）分解图像为高频和低频分量，分别设计高频分支（DFFE模块增强边缘细节）和低频分支（Transformer捕获全局语义），并通过FDID和PCDM模块优化特征建模，最后融合高低频特征。

Result: 在多个遥感数据集上的实验表明，WGDF显著减轻了边缘模糊问题，检测精度和鲁棒性优于现有方法。

Conclusion: WGDF通过频域特征建模和融合，有效提升了遥感图像变化检测的性能，尤其在边缘细节和全局结构表征方面表现突出。

Abstract: Change detection in remote sensing imagery plays a vital role in various
engineering applications, such as natural disaster monitoring, urban expansion
tracking, and infrastructure management. Despite the remarkable progress of
deep learning in recent years, most existing methods still rely on
spatial-domain modeling, where the limited diversity of feature representations
hinders the detection of subtle change regions. We observe that
frequency-domain feature modeling particularly in the wavelet domain an amplify
fine-grained differences in frequency components, enhancing the perception of
edge changes that are challenging to capture in the spatial domain. Thus, we
propose a method called Wavelet-Guided Dual-Frequency Encoding (WGDF).
Specifically, we first apply Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to decompose the
input images into high-frequency and low-frequency components, which are used
to model local details and global structures, respectively. In the
high-frequency branch, we design a Dual-Frequency Feature Enhancement (DFFE)
module to strengthen edge detail representation and introduce a
Frequency-Domain Interactive Difference (FDID) module to enhance the modeling
of fine-grained changes. In the low-frequency branch, we exploit Transformers
to capture global semantic relationships and employ a Progressive Contextual
Difference Module (PCDM) to progressively refine change regions, enabling
precise structural semantic characterization. Finally, the high- and
low-frequency features are synergistically fused to unify local sensitivity
with global discriminability. Extensive experiments on multiple remote sensing
datasets demonstrate that WGDF significantly alleviates edge ambiguity and
achieves superior detection accuracy and robustness compared to
state-of-the-art methods. The code will be available at
https://github.com/boshizhang123/WGDF.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于LLM的视觉语义抑郁评估方法（VS-LLM），用于自动化分析PPAT草图，以支持心理学家进行大规模心理状态评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PPAT草图解释依赖心理学家经验且耗时，需要一种自动化方法来提高效率和准确性。

Method: 提出VS-LLM方法，结合视觉和语义分析，自动化评估PPAT草图的抑郁状态。

Result: 实验结果显示，VS-LLM方法比心理学家评估方法提高了17.6%的准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法为基于PPAT草图的心理状态评估提供了有效工具，数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: The Drawing Projection Test (DPT) is an essential tool in art therapy,
allowing psychologists to assess participants' mental states through their
sketches. Specifically, through sketches with the theme of "a person picking an
apple from a tree (PPAT)", it can be revealed whether the participants are in
mental states such as depression. Compared with scales, the DPT can enrich
psychologists' understanding of an individual's mental state. However, the
interpretation of the PPAT is laborious and depends on the experience of the
psychologists. To address this issue, we propose an effective identification
method to support psychologists in conducting a large-scale automatic DPT.
Unlike traditional sketch recognition, DPT more focus on the overall evaluation
of the sketches, such as color usage and space utilization. Moreover, PPAT
imposes a time limit and prohibits verbal reminders, resulting in low drawing
accuracy and a lack of detailed depiction. To address these challenges, we
propose the following efforts: (1) Providing an experimental environment for
automated analysis of PPAT sketches for depression assessment; (2) Offering a
Visual-Semantic depression assessment based on LLM (VS-LLM) method; (3)
Experimental results demonstrate that our method improves by 17.6% compared to
the psychologist assessment method. We anticipate that this work will
contribute to the research in mental state assessment based on PPAT sketches'
elements recognition. Our datasets and codes are available at

Conclusion: CoCAViT通过改进架构和引入CoCA机制，显著提升了小模型的泛化能力和实时性能。

Abstract: In recent years, large-scale visual backbones have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in learning general-purpose features from images via extensive
pre-training. Concurrently, many efficient architectures have emerged that have
performance comparable to that of larger models on in-domain benchmarks.
However, we observe that for smaller models, the performance drop on
out-of-distribution (OOD) data is disproportionately larger, indicating a
deficiency in the generalization performance of existing efficient models. To
address this, we identify key architectural bottlenecks and inappropriate
design choices that contribute to this issue, retaining robustness for smaller
models. To restore the global field of pure window attention, we further
introduce a Coordinator-patch Cross Attention (CoCA) mechanism, featuring
dynamic, domain-aware global tokens that enhance local-global feature modeling
and adaptively capture robust patterns across domains with minimal
computational overhead. Integrating these advancements, we present CoCAViT, a
novel visual backbone designed for robust real-time visual representation.
Extensive experiments empirically validate our design. At a resolution of
224*224, CoCAViT-28M achieves 84.0% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K, with
significant gains on multiple OOD benchmarks, compared to competing models. It
also attains 52.2 mAP on COCO object detection and 51.3 mIOU on ADE20K semantic
segmentation, while maintaining low latency.

Conclusion: mKG-RAG通过结构化多模态知识提升了生成质量，为知识密集型VQA任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been proposed to expand
internal knowledge of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by incorporating
external knowledge databases into the generation process, which is widely used
for knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks. Despite impressive
advancements, vanilla RAG-based VQA methods that rely on unstructured documents
and overlook the structural relationships among knowledge elements frequently
introduce irrelevant or misleading content, reducing answer accuracy and
reliability. To overcome these challenges, a promising solution is to integrate
multimodal knowledge graphs (KGs) into RAG-based VQA frameworks to enhance the
generation by introducing structured multimodal knowledge. Therefore, in this
paper, we propose a novel multimodal knowledge-augmented generation framework
(mKG-RAG) based on multimodal KGs for knowledge-intensive VQA tasks.
Specifically, our approach leverages MLLM-powered keyword extraction and
vision-text matching to distill semantically consistent and modality-aligned
entities/relationships from multimodal documents, constructing high-quality
multimodal KGs as structured knowledge representations. In addition, a
dual-stage retrieval strategy equipped with a question-aware multimodal
retriever is introduced to improve retrieval efficiency while refining
precision. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms existing methods, setting a new state-of-the-art for
knowledge-based VQA.

Result: 实验显示，微调后的模型在八种语言上表现提升，生成更丰富的描述，验证了文化和语言能力的双重增强。

Conclusion: MELLA数据集有效提升了MLLM在低资源语言中的表现，强调了文化和语言能力的重要性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable performance in
high-resource languages. However, their effectiveness diminishes significantly
in the contexts of low-resource languages. Current multilingual enhancement
methods are often limited to text modality or rely solely on machine
translation. While such approaches help models acquire basic linguistic
capabilities and produce "thin descriptions", they neglect the importance of
multimodal informativeness and cultural groundedness, both of which are crucial
for serving low-resource language users effectively. To bridge this gap, in
this study, we identify two significant objectives for a truly effective MLLM
in low-resource language settings, namely 1) linguistic capability and 2)
cultural groundedness, placing special emphasis on cultural awareness. To
achieve these dual objectives, we propose a dual-source strategy that guides
the collection of data tailored to each goal, sourcing native web alt-text for
culture and MLLM-generated captions for linguistics. As a concrete
implementation, we introduce MELLA, a multimodal, multilingual dataset.
Experiment results show that after fine-tuning on MELLA, there is a general
performance improvement for the eight languages on various MLLM backbones, with
models producing "thick descriptions". We verify that the performance gains are
from both cultural knowledge enhancement and linguistic capability enhancement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型预训练视觉语言模型在目标检测任务中表现出色，但针对特定目标的微调通常会导致原始自然语言查询和零样本能力的丧失。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用类似文本反转（TI）的方法，通过仅学习新的或改进的token来扩展VLM的词汇表，同时保持原始模型权重冻结。

Result: 该方法在少量样本（如三个示例）下即可准确检测新对象，且与原始模型完全兼容，保留了其零样本能力。计算开销显著低于全模型微调。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在多种定量和定性实验中表现优于基线方法，有效解决了遗忘问题。

Abstract: Recent progress in large pre-trained vision language models (VLMs) has
reached state-of-the-art performance on several object detection benchmarks and
boasts strong zero-shot capabilities, but for optimal performance on specific
targets some form of finetuning is still necessary. While the initial VLM
weights allow for great few-shot transfer learning, this usually involves the
loss of the original natural language querying and zero-shot capabilities.
Inspired by the success of Textual Inversion (TI) in personalizing
text-to-image diffusion models, we propose a similar formulation for
open-vocabulary object detection. TI allows extending the VLM vocabulary by
learning new or improving existing tokens to accurately detect novel or
fine-grained objects from as little as three examples. The learned tokens are
completely compatible with the original VLM weights while keeping them frozen,
retaining the original model's benchmark performance, and leveraging its
existing capabilities such as zero-shot domain transfer (e.g., detecting a
sketch of an object after training only on real photos). The storage and
gradient calculations are limited to the token embedding dimension, requiring
significantly less compute than full-model fine-tuning. We evaluated whether
the method matches or outperforms the baseline methods that suffer from
forgetting in a wide variety of quantitative and qualitative experiments.

TL;DR: 3D Gabor Splatting (3DGabSplat) 提出了一种基于3D Gabor的基元，用于提升3D场景的高频细节表示，同时减少冗余基元和内存开销，显著提升了渲染质量和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）在实时渲染和高保真新视角合成方面表现突出，但其高斯函数本质上是低通的，难以捕捉高频细节，且存在冗余基元和内存开销问题。

Method: 提出3D Gabor Splatting（3DGabSplat），利用多方向3D频率响应的3D Gabor基元表示辐射场，并开发了高效的CUDA光栅化器和频率自适应机制。

Result: 实验表明，3DGabSplat在渲染质量和效率上优于3DGS及其变体，PSNR提升高达1.35 dB，同时减少了基元数量和内存消耗。

Conclusion: 3DGabSplat可无缝集成到现有3DGS框架中，显著提升新视角合成的质量和效率。

Abstract: Recent prominence in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has enabled real-time
rendering while maintaining high-fidelity novel view synthesis. However, 3DGS
resorts to the Gaussian function that is low-pass by nature and is restricted
in representing high-frequency details in 3D scenes. Moreover, it causes
redundant primitives with degraded training and rendering efficiency and
excessive memory overhead. To overcome these limitations, we propose 3D Gabor
Splatting (3DGabSplat) that leverages a novel 3D Gabor-based primitive with
multiple directional 3D frequency responses for radiance field representation
supervised by multi-view images. The proposed 3D Gabor-based primitive forms a
filter bank incorporating multiple 3D Gabor kernels at different frequencies to
enhance flexibility and efficiency in capturing fine 3D details. Furthermore,
to achieve novel view rendering, an efficient CUDA-based rasterizer is
developed to project the multiple directional 3D frequency components
characterized by 3D Gabor-based primitives onto the 2D image plane, and a
frequency-adaptive mechanism is presented for adaptive joint optimization of
primitives. 3DGabSplat is scalable to be a plug-and-play kernel for seamless
integration into existing 3DGS paradigms to enhance both efficiency and quality
of novel view synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 3DGabSplat
outperforms 3DGS and its variants using alternative primitives, and achieves
state-of-the-art rendering quality across both real-world and synthetic scenes.
Remarkably, we achieve up to 1.35 dB PSNR gain over 3DGS with simultaneously
reduced number of primitives and memory consumption.

Conclusion: PriorRG通过模拟临床工作流和整合先验知识，显著提升了胸部X光报告生成的临床准确性和流畅性。

Abstract: Chest X-ray report generation aims to reduce radiologists' workload by
automatically producing high-quality preliminary reports. A critical yet
underexplored aspect of this task is the effective use of patient-specific
prior knowledge -- including clinical context (e.g., symptoms, medical history)
and the most recent prior image -- which radiologists routinely rely on for
diagnostic reasoning. Most existing methods generate reports from single
images, neglecting this essential prior information and thus failing to capture
diagnostic intent or disease progression. To bridge this gap, we propose
PriorRG, a novel chest X-ray report generation framework that emulates
real-world clinical workflows via a two-stage training pipeline. In Stage 1, we
introduce a prior-guided contrastive pre-training scheme that leverages
clinical context to guide spatiotemporal feature extraction, allowing the model
to align more closely with the intrinsic spatiotemporal semantics in radiology
reports. In Stage 2, we present a prior-aware coarse-to-fine decoding for
report generation that progressively integrates patient-specific prior
knowledge with the vision encoder's hidden states. This decoding allows the
model to align with diagnostic focus and track disease progression, thereby
enhancing the clinical accuracy and fluency of the generated reports. Extensive
experiments on MIMIC-CXR and MIMIC-ABN datasets demonstrate that PriorRG
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 3.6% BLEU-4 and 3.8% F1 score
improvement on MIMIC-CXR, and a 5.9% BLEU-1 gain on MIMIC-ABN. Code and
checkpoints will be released upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Slice-Loc提出了一种两阶段的跨视角定位方法，通过分割图像生成冗余观测，并利用几何刚性公式和NFA模型验证定位可靠性，显著提升了定位精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨视角定位方法通常仅输出单一相机位姿，缺乏冗余观测，难以验证定位可靠性。

Method: Slice-Loc将查询图像分割为子图像，为每个子图像估计3-DoF位姿，通过几何刚性公式过滤错误位姿，并利用NFA模型量化定位可靠性。

Result: Slice-Loc将误差超过10米的比例降至3%以下，在DReSS数据集上，平均定位误差从4.47米降至1.86米，平均方向误差从3.42°降至1.24°。

Conclusion: Slice-Loc通过冗余观测和可靠性验证，显著提升了跨视角定位的精度和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Cross-view localization (CVL) matches ground-level images with aerial
references to determine the geo-position of a camera, enabling smart vehicles
to self-localize offline in GNSS-denied environments. However, most CVL methods
output only a single observation, the camera pose, and lack the redundant
observations required by surveying principles, making it challenging to assess
localization reliability through the mutual validation of observational data.
To tackle this, we introduce Slice-Loc, a two-stage method featuring an
a-contrario reliability validation for CVL. Instead of using the query image as
a single input, Slice-Loc divides it into sub-images and estimates the 3-DoF
pose for each slice, creating redundant and independent observations. Then, a
geometric rigidity formula is proposed to filter out the erroneous 3-DoF poses,
and the inliers are merged to generate the final camera pose. Furthermore, we
propose a model that quantifies the meaningfulness of localization by
estimating the number of false alarms (NFA), according to the distribution of
the locations of the sliced images. By eliminating gross errors, Slice-Loc
boosts localization accuracy and effectively detects failures. After filtering
out mislocalizations, Slice-Loc reduces the proportion of errors exceeding 10 m
to under 3\%. In cross-city tests on the DReSS dataset, Slice-Loc cuts the mean
localization error from 4.47 m to 1.86 m and the mean orientation error from
$\mathbf{3.42^{\circ}}$ to $\mathbf{1.24^{\circ}}$, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods. Code and dataset will be available at:

Motivation: 当前方法仅依赖全局图像特征，忽略了细粒度器官关系对准确报告的重要性，因此需要一种能捕捉这些关系的方法。

Method: 提出CT-GRAPH，利用分层图注意力网络建模解剖知识，结合预训练特征编码器和语言模型生成报告。

Result: 在CT-RATE数据集上，F1分数比现有方法提高了7.9%。

Conclusion: CT-GRAPH通过建模细粒度器官关系，显著提升了CT报告生成的性能。

Abstract: As medical imaging is central to diagnostic processes, automating the
generation of radiology reports has become increasingly relevant to assist
radiologists with their heavy workloads. Most current methods rely solely on
global image features, failing to capture fine-grained organ relationships
crucial for accurate reporting. To this end, we propose CT-GRAPH, a
hierarchical graph attention network that explicitly models radiological
knowledge by structuring anatomical regions into a graph, linking fine-grained
organ features to coarser anatomical systems and a global patient context. Our
method leverages pretrained 3D medical feature encoders to obtain global and
organ-level features by utilizing anatomical masks. These features are further
refined within the graph and then integrated into a large language model to
generate detailed medical reports. We evaluate our approach for the task of
report generation on the large-scale chest CT dataset CT-RATE. We provide an
in-depth analysis of pretrained feature encoders for CT report generation and
show that our method achieves a substantial improvement of absolute 7.9\% in F1
score over current state-of-the-art methods. The code is publicly available at

TL;DR: Uni-CoT是一个统一的链式思维框架，通过结合图像理解和生成能力，实现连贯的多模态推理，并在计算效率和性能上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在视觉语言推理任务中难以建模视觉状态转换或视觉轨迹不连贯的问题。

Method: 提出两层次推理范式：宏观层次用于任务规划，微观层次用于子任务执行，结合图像-文本监督和多任务目标进行训练。

Result: 在WISE、RISE和KRIS基准测试中表现最优，并展现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: Uni-CoT为多模态推理提供了一种高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has been widely adopted to enhance Large
Language Models (LLMs) by decomposing complex tasks into simpler, sequential
subtasks. However, extending CoT to vision-language reasoning tasks remains
challenging, as it often requires interpreting transitions of visual states to
support reasoning. Existing methods often struggle with this due to limited
capacity of modeling visual state transitions or incoherent visual trajectories
caused by fragmented architectures.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose Uni-CoT, a Unified Chain-of-Thought
framework that enables coherent and grounded multimodal reasoning within a
single unified model. The key idea is to leverage a model capable of both image
understanding and generation to reason over visual content and model evolving
visual states. However, empowering a unified model to achieve that is
non-trivial, given the high computational cost and the burden of training. To
address this, Uni-CoT introduces a novel two-level reasoning paradigm: A
Macro-Level CoT for high-level task planning and A Micro-Level CoT for subtask
execution. This design significantly reduces the computational overhead.
Furthermore, we introduce a structured training paradigm that combines
interleaved image-text supervision for macro-level CoT with multi-task
objectives for micro-level CoT. Together, these innovations allow Uni-CoT to
perform scalable and coherent multi-modal reasoning. Furthermore, thanks to our
design, all experiments can be efficiently completed using only 8 A100 GPUs
with 80GB VRAM each. Experimental results on reasoning-driven image generation
benchmark (WISE) and editing benchmarks (RISE and KRIS) indicates that Uni-CoT
demonstrates SOTA performance and strong generalization, establishing Uni-CoT
as a promising solution for multi-modal reasoning. Project Page and Code:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如MIL和静态GNN）难以捕捉组织结构的空间依赖性，且注意力机制缺乏特异性。

Method: 构建动态加权有向图，结合可学习空间偏移，自适应关注形态相关区域。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: 可变形注意力能有效捕捉复杂空间结构，提升病理图像分析效果。

Abstract: Accurate classification of Whole Slide Images (WSIs) and Regions of Interest
(ROIs) is a fundamental challenge in computational pathology. While mainstream
approaches often adopt Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), they struggle to
capture the spatial dependencies among tissue structures. Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) have emerged as a solution to model inter-instance relationships, yet
most rely on static graph topologies and overlook the physical spatial
positions of tissue patches. Moreover, conventional attention mechanisms lack
specificity, limiting their ability to focus on structurally relevant regions.
In this work, we propose a novel GNN framework with deformable attention for
pathology image analysis. We construct a dynamic weighted directed graph based
on patch features, where each node aggregates contextual information from its
neighbors via attention-weighted edges. Specifically, we incorporate learnable
spatial offsets informed by the real coordinates of each patch, enabling the
model to adaptively attend to morphologically relevant regions across the
slide. This design significantly enhances the contextual field while preserving
spatial specificity. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on
four benchmark datasets (TCGA-COAD, BRACS, gastric intestinal metaplasia
grading, and intestinal ROI classification), demonstrating the power of
deformable attention in capturing complex spatial structures in WSIs and ROIs.

TL;DR: 论文提出GUI-RC和GUI-RCPO方法，通过测试时空间投票和强化学习提升GUI定位精度，无需额外训练数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GUI定位方法依赖昂贵像素级标注，限制了性能提升。

Method: GUI-RC通过多预测空间投票识别共识区域；GUI-RCPO将共识转化为强化学习奖励，优化预测。

Result: GUI-RC提升精度2-3%，GUI-RCPO进一步优化至85.14%。

Conclusion: 测试时缩放和强化学习为GUI定位提供高效路径。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) grounding, the task of mapping natural
language instructions to precise screen coordinates, is fundamental to
autonomous GUI agents. While existing methods achieve strong performance
through extensive supervised training or reinforcement learning with labeled
rewards, they remain constrained by the cost and availability of pixel-level
annotations. We observe that when models generate multiple predictions for the
same GUI element, the spatial overlap patterns reveal implicit confidence
signals that can guide more accurate localization. Leveraging this insight, we
propose GUI-RC (Region Consistency), a test-time scaling method that constructs
spatial voting grids from multiple sampled predictions to identify consensus
regions where models show highest agreement. Without any training, GUI-RC
improves accuracy by 2-3% across various architectures on ScreenSpot
benchmarks. We further introduce GUI-RCPO (Region Consistency Policy
Optimization), which transforms these consistency patterns into rewards for
test-time reinforcement learning. By computing how well each prediction aligns
with the collective consensus, GUI-RCPO enables models to iteratively refine
their outputs on unlabeled data during inference. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the generality of our approach: GUI-RC boosts
Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct from 80.11% to 83.57% on ScreenSpot-v2, while GUI-RCPO
further improves it to 85.14% through self-supervised optimization. Our
approach reveals the untapped potential of test-time scaling and test-time
reinforcement learning for GUI grounding, offering a promising path toward more
robust and data-efficient GUI agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像生成模型（如扩散模型和掩码生成变换器）在组合生成时存在属性绑定和文本-图像对齐的挑战，而掩码生成变换器在此方面的研究较少。

Method: 提出UNCAGE方法，利用注意力图指导解掩码过程，优先处理清晰表示单个对象的标记。

Result: UNCAGE在多个基准测试和指标上均提升了性能，且推理开销可忽略不计。

Conclusion: UNCAGE是一种高效且无需额外训练的方法，显著提升了组合文本到图像生成的保真度。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation has been actively studied using Diffusion
Models and Autoregressive Models. Recently, Masked Generative Transformers have
gained attention as an alternative to Autoregressive Models to overcome the
inherent limitations of causal attention and autoregressive decoding through
bidirectional attention and parallel decoding, enabling efficient and
high-quality image generation. However, compositional T2I generation remains
challenging, as even state-of-the-art Diffusion Models often fail to accurately
bind attributes and achieve proper text-image alignment. While Diffusion Models
have been extensively studied for this issue, Masked Generative Transformers
exhibit similar limitations but have not been explored in this context. To
address this, we propose Unmasking with Contrastive Attention Guidance
(UNCAGE), a novel training-free method that improves compositional fidelity by
leveraging attention maps to prioritize the unmasking of tokens that clearly
represent individual objects. UNCAGE consistently improves performance in both
quantitative and qualitative evaluations across multiple benchmarks and
metrics, with negligible inference overhead. Our code is available at

Motivation: 物理对抗伪装在安全关键领域（如自动驾驶）中构成重大风险，现有技术因环境变化导致梯度优化不稳定和攻击效果不佳。

Method: 引入梯度校准策略确保梯度更新的连续性，开发梯度去相关方法消除多角度优化中的冗余或冲突更新。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了对抗性伪装的效果，同时强调了现实场景中需要更鲁棒的系统设计。

Abstract: The advancement of deep object detectors has greatly affected safety-critical
fields like autonomous driving. However, physical adversarial camouflage poses
a significant security risk by altering object textures to deceive detectors.
Existing techniques struggle with variable physical environments, facing two
main challenges: 1) inconsistent sampling point densities across distances
hinder the gradient optimization from ensuring local continuity, and 2)
updating texture gradients from multiple angles causes conflicts, reducing
optimization stability and attack effectiveness. To address these issues, we
propose a novel adversarial camouflage framework based on gradient
optimization. First, we introduce a gradient calibration strategy, which
ensures consistent gradient updates across distances by propagating gradients
from sparsely to unsampled texture points. Additionally, we develop a gradient
decorrelation method, which prioritizes and orthogonalizes gradients based on
loss values, enhancing stability and effectiveness in multi-angle optimization
by eliminating redundant or conflicting updates. Extensive experimental results
on various detection models, angles and distances show that our method
significantly exceeds the state of the art, with an average increase in attack
success rate (ASR) of 13.46% across distances and 11.03% across angles.
Furthermore, empirical evaluation in real-world scenarios highlights the need
for more robust system design.

TL;DR: SmoothSA改进Slot Attention（SA）在对象中心学习（OCL）中的表现，通过预热冷启动查询和区分视频帧间的处理，提升对象聚合精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冷启动查询缺乏样本特定信息，影响图像或视频首帧的精确聚合；非首帧查询已具备样本信息，需不同处理方式。

Method: SmoothSA通过预热冷启动查询（首帧）和区分首帧与非首帧的处理（视频），优化SA迭代和递归。

Result: 在对象发现、识别及下游任务中表现优异，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: SmoothSA通过平滑SA迭代和递归，显著提升了对象中心学习的性能。

Abstract: Slot Attention (SA) and its variants lie at the heart of mainstream
Object-Centric Learning (OCL). Objects in an image can be aggregated into
respective slot vectors, by \textit{iteratively} refining cold-start query
vectors, typically three times, via SA on image features. For video, such
aggregation is \textit{recurrently} shared across frames, with queries
cold-started on the first frame while transitioned from the previous frame's
slots on non-first frames. However, the cold-start queries lack sample-specific
cues thus hinder precise aggregation on the image or video's first frame; Also,
non-first frames' queries are already sample-specific thus require transforms
different from the first frame's aggregation. We address these issues for the
first time with our \textit{SmoothSA}: (1) To smooth SA iterations on the image
or video's first frame, we \textit{preheat} the cold-start queries with rich
information of input features, via a tiny module self-distilled inside OCL; (2)
To smooth SA recurrences across all video frames, we \textit{differentiate} the
homogeneous transforms on the first and non-first frames, by using full and
single iterations respectively. Comprehensive experiments on object discovery,
recognition and downstream benchmarks validate our method's effectiveness.
Further analyses intuitively illuminate how our method smooths SA iterations
and recurrences. Our code is available in the supplement.

Result: 在MS COCO和ImageNet-1k基准测试中，FIxLIP优于一阶方法，并能有效比较不同模型。

Conclusion: FIxLIP提供了高质量的解释，并在模型比较中展示了实用性。

Abstract: Language-image pre-training (LIP) enables the development of vision-language
models capable of zero-shot classification, localization, multimodal retrieval,
and semantic understanding. Various explanation methods have been proposed to
visualize the importance of input image-text pairs on the model's similarity
outputs. However, popular saliency maps are limited by capturing only
first-order attributions, overlooking the complex cross-modal interactions
intrinsic to such encoders. We introduce faithful interaction explanations of
LIP models (FIxLIP) as a unified approach to decomposing the similarity in
vision-language encoders. FIxLIP is rooted in game theory, where we analyze how
using the weighted Banzhaf interaction index offers greater flexibility and
improves computational efficiency over the Shapley interaction quantification
framework. From a practical perspective, we propose how to naturally extend
explanation evaluation metrics, like the pointing game and area between the
insertion/deletion curves, to second-order interaction explanations.
Experiments on MS COCO and ImageNet-1k benchmarks validate that second-order
methods like FIxLIP outperform first-order attribution methods. Beyond
delivering high-quality explanations, we demonstrate the utility of FIxLIP in
comparing different models like CLIP vs. SigLIP-2 and ViT-B/32 vs. ViT-L/16.

Result: 在MVTec数据集上实现了单尺度下的最先进性能。

Conclusion: FM为无监督异常检测提供了理论支持的高效框架，WT-Flow通过动态控制实现了异常样本的有效分离。

Abstract: We propose a new paradigm for unsupervised anomaly detection and localization
using Flow Matching (FM), which fundamentally addresses the model expressivity
limitations of conventional flow-based methods. To this end, we formalize the
concept of time-reversed Flow Matching (rFM) as a vector field regression along
a predefined probability path to transform unknown data distributions into
standard Gaussian. We bring two core observations that reshape our
understanding of FM. First, we rigorously prove that FM with linear
interpolation probability paths is inherently non-invertible. Second, our
analysis reveals that employing reversed Gaussian probability paths in
high-dimensional spaces can lead to trivial vector fields. This issue arises
due to the manifold-related constraints. Building on the second observation, we
propose Worst Transport (WT) displacement interpolation to reconstruct a
non-probabilistic evolution path. The proposed WT-Flow enhances dynamical
control over sample trajectories, constructing ''degenerate potential wells''
for anomaly-free samples while allowing anomalous samples to escape. This novel
unsupervised paradigm offers a theoretically grounded separation mechanism for
anomalous samples. Notably, FM provides a computationally tractable framework
that scales to complex data. We present the first successful application of FM
for the unsupervised anomaly detection task, achieving state-of-the-art
performance at a single scale on the MVTec dataset. The reproducible code for
training will be released upon camera-ready submission.

Conclusion: F2PASeg和PAS数据集为垂体手术的解剖结构分割提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Pituitary tumors often cause deformation or encapsulation of adjacent vital
structures. Anatomical structure segmentation can provide surgeons with early
warnings of regions that pose surgical risks, thereby enhancing the safety of
pituitary surgery. However, pixel-level annotated video stream datasets for
pituitary surgeries are extremely rare. To address this challenge, we introduce
a new dataset for Pituitary Anatomy Segmentation (PAS). PAS comprises 7,845
time-coherent images extracted from 120 videos. To mitigate class imbalance, we
apply data augmentation techniques that simulate the presence of surgical
instruments in the training data. One major challenge in pituitary anatomy
segmentation is the inconsistency in feature representation due to occlusions,
camera motion, and surgical bleeding. By incorporating a Feature Fusion module,
F2PASeg is proposed to refine anatomical structure segmentation by leveraging
both high-resolution image features and deep semantic embeddings, enhancing
robustness against intraoperative variations. Experimental results demonstrate
that F2PASeg consistently segments critical anatomical structures in real time,
providing a reliable solution for intraoperative pituitary surgery planning.

Result: 高保真压缩模型因图像真实性高而显著增加攻击难度，低保真模型则易被攻破。

Conclusion: 图像真实性是防御对抗攻击的关键因素，未来攻击技术需克服这一挑战。

Abstract: Previous work has suggested that preprocessing images through lossy
compression can defend against adversarial perturbations, but comprehensive
attack evaluations have been lacking. In this paper, we construct strong
white-box and adaptive attacks against various compression models and identify
a critical challenge for attackers: high realism in reconstructed images
significantly increases attack difficulty. Through rigorous evaluation across
multiple attack scenarios, we demonstrate that compression models capable of
producing realistic, high-fidelity reconstructions are substantially more
resistant to our attacks. In contrast, low-realism compression models can be
broken. Our analysis reveals that this is not due to gradient masking. Rather,
realistic reconstructions maintaining distributional alignment with natural
images seem to offer inherent robustness. This work highlights a significant
obstacle for future adversarial attacks and suggests that developing more
effective techniques to overcome realism represents an essential challenge for
comprehensive security evaluation.

Motivation: 预训练基础模型在现代或领域特定图像上表现良好，但因历史地图缺乏一致性而表现不佳。

Result: SMOL-MapSeg能准确分割OND知识定义的类别，并通过少量样本适应新类别，性能优于UNet基线。

Conclusion: OND知识提示方法有效提升了历史地图分割的准确性和适应性。

Abstract: Historical maps are valuable for studying changes to the Earth's surface.
With the rise of deep learning, models like UNet have been used to extract
information from these maps through semantic segmentation. Recently,
pre-trained foundation models have shown strong performance across domains such
as autonomous driving, medical imaging, and industrial inspection. However,
they struggle with historical maps. These models are trained on modern or
domain-specific images, where patterns can be tied to predefined concepts
through common sense or expert knowledge. Historical maps lack such consistency
-- similar concepts can appear in vastly different shapes and styles. To
address this, we propose On-Need Declarative (OND) knowledge-based prompting,
which introduces explicit prompts to guide the model on what patterns
correspond to which concepts. This allows users to specify the target concept
and pattern during inference (on-need inference). We implement this by
replacing the prompt encoder of the foundation model SAM with our OND prompting
mechanism and fine-tune it on historical maps. The resulting model is called
SMOL-MapSeg (Show Me One Label). Experiments show that SMOL-MapSeg can
accurately segment classes defined by OND knowledge. It can also adapt to
unseen classes through few-shot fine-tuning. Additionally, it outperforms a
UNet-based baseline in average segmentation performance.

Method: AutoIAD采用Manager-Driven中心智能体协调多个子智能体（数据准备、数据加载、模型设计、训练），并结合领域知识库，从原始工业图像数据开发异常检测模型。

Result: 实验表明，AutoIAD在任务完成率和模型性能（AUROC）上显著优于现有框架，并通过迭代优化减少幻觉问题。消融研究证实了Manager智能体和知识库模块的关键作用。

Conclusion: AutoIAD为工业异常检测提供了一种高效、自动化的解决方案，其框架设计和知识库集成是关键成功因素。

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection (IAD) is critical for manufacturing quality
control, but conventionally requires significant manual effort for various
application scenarios. This paper introduces AutoIAD, a multi-agent
collaboration framework, specifically designed for end-to-end automated
development of industrial visual anomaly detection. AutoIAD leverages a
Manager-Driven central agent to orchestrate specialized sub-agents (including
Data Preparation, Data Loader, Model Designer, Trainer) and integrates a
domain-specific knowledge base, which intelligently handles the entire pipeline
using raw industrial image data to develop a trained anomaly detection model.
We construct a comprehensive benchmark using MVTec AD datasets to evaluate
AutoIAD across various LLM backends. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
AutoIAD significantly outperforms existing general-purpose agentic
collaboration frameworks and traditional AutoML frameworks in task completion
rate and model performance (AUROC), while effectively mitigating issues like
hallucination through iterative refinement. Ablation studies further confirm
the crucial roles of the Manager central agent and the domain knowledge base
module in producing robust and high-quality IAD solutions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Diff3F框架的无监督手性特征提取方法，用于增强形状顶点的手性信息，并在多个下游任务中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手性信息在形状分析中普遍存在，但现有形状描述符缺乏手性感知能力，亟需开发相关特征提取方法。

Method: 基于Diff3F框架，利用2D基础模型提取手性特征，并通过无监督方式增强形状顶点的手性信息。

Result: 在左右解耦、形状匹配和部件分割等任务中，提取的手性特征表现出显著效果和实用性。

Conclusion: 该方法填补了形状分析中手性特征提取的空白，为相关应用提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Chirality information (i.e. information that allows distinguishing left from
right) is ubiquitous for various data modes in computer vision, including
images, videos, point clouds, and meshes. While chirality has been extensively
studied in the image domain, its exploration in shape analysis (such as point
clouds and meshes) remains underdeveloped. Although many shape vertex
descriptors have shown appealing properties (e.g. robustness to rigid-body
transformations), they are often not able to disambiguate between left and
right symmetric parts. Considering the ubiquity of chirality information in
different shape analysis problems and the lack of chirality-aware features
within current shape descriptors, developing a chirality feature extractor
becomes necessary and urgent. Based on the recent Diff3F framework, we propose
an unsupervised chirality feature extraction pipeline to decorate shape
vertices with chirality-aware information, extracted from 2D foundation models.
We evaluated the extracted chirality features through quantitative and
qualitative experiments across diverse datasets. Results from downstream tasks
including left-right disentanglement, shape matching, and part segmentation
demonstrate their effectiveness and practical utility. Project page:

### [159] [MagicHOI: Leveraging 3D Priors for Accurate Hand-object Reconstruction from Short Monocular Video Clips](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05506)
*Shibo Wang,Haonan He,Maria Parelli,Christoph Gebhardt,Zicong Fan,Jie Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MagicHOI提出了一种从单目视频中重建手和物体的方法，利用新视角合成扩散模型作为先验，解决了物体部分不可见的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖物体模板或假设物体完全可见，但在实际场景中，固定视角和静态抓握会导致物体部分不可见，重建结果不真实。

Method: MagicHOI结合新视角合成扩散模型，利用其作为先验来规范化不可见物体区域，并通过可见接触约束对齐手和物体。

Result: MagicHOI在3D手-物体重建任务中显著优于现有方法，新视角合成扩散先验有效规范化了不可见区域。

Conclusion: MagicHOI通过引入新视角合成扩散先验，提升了部分不可见物体的重建效果，为手-物体交互重建提供了新思路。

Abstract: Most RGB-based hand-object reconstruction methods rely on object templates,
while template-free methods typically assume full object visibility. This
assumption often breaks in real-world settings, where fixed camera viewpoints
and static grips leave parts of the object unobserved, resulting in implausible
reconstructions. To overcome this, we present MagicHOI, a method for
reconstructing hands and objects from short monocular interaction videos, even
under limited viewpoint variation. Our key insight is that, despite the
scarcity of paired 3D hand-object data, large-scale novel view synthesis
diffusion models offer rich object supervision. This supervision serves as a
prior to regularize unseen object regions during hand interactions. Leveraging
this insight, we integrate a novel view synthesis model into our hand-object
reconstruction framework. We further align hand to object by incorporating
visible contact constraints. Our results demonstrate that MagicHOI
significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art hand-object reconstruction
methods. We also show that novel view synthesis diffusion priors effectively
regularize unseen object regions, enhancing 3D hand-object reconstruction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种自监督预训练框架，用于从稀疏且噪声较多的事件数据中提取潜在信息，包括边缘和纹理线索，并在多个下游任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机数据稀疏且噪声多，传统方法难以有效提取特征，需要一种新方法来充分利用其高时间分辨率和动态范围的优势。

Method: 框架分为三个阶段：差异引导掩码建模、固定主干特征转换和聚焦对比学习，分别用于增强信息提取、保留学习表示和提升语义区分能力。

Result: 实验表明，该框架在物体识别、语义分割和光流估计等任务中均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的自监督预训练框架能有效提取事件数据中的潜在信息，并在多个任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Event camera, a novel neuromorphic vision sensor, records data with high
temporal resolution and wide dynamic range, offering new possibilities for
accurate visual representation in challenging scenarios. However, event data is
inherently sparse and noisy, mainly reflecting brightness changes, which
complicates effective feature extraction. To address this, we propose a
self-supervised pre-training framework to fully reveal latent information in
event data, including edge information and texture cues. Our framework consists
of three stages: Difference-guided Masked Modeling, inspired by the event
physical sampling process, reconstructs temporal intensity difference maps to
extract enhanced information from raw event data. Backbone-fixed Feature
Transition contrasts event and image features without updating the backbone to
preserve representations learned from masked modeling and stabilizing their
effect on contrastive learning. Focus-aimed Contrastive Learning updates the
entire model to improve semantic discrimination by focusing on high-value
regions. Extensive experiments show our framework is robust and consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on various downstream tasks, including
object recognition, semantic segmentation, and optical flow estimation. The
code and dataset are available at https://github.com/BIT-Vision/EventPretrain.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种增强的视觉行人跟踪框架，通过结合更丰富的特征表示和鲁棒的运动模型，解决了严重遮挡场景下的跟踪问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中行人跟踪常因遮挡导致特征丢失，传统方法依赖全身边界框特征和线性运动假设，在严重遮挡时表现不佳。

Method: 结合目标检测器的回归和分类分支特征，引入头部关键点检测模型以减少遮挡影响，并提出迭代卡尔曼滤波方法整合3D先验。

Result: 提出的方法在拥挤环境中提供了更鲁棒的多目标跟踪解决方案。

Conclusion: 通过改进外观和运动建模，该方法在遮挡严重的场景中表现更优。

Abstract: Visual pedestrian tracking represents a promising research field, with
extensive applications in intelligent surveillance, behavior analysis, and
human-computer interaction. However, real-world applications face significant
occlusion challenges. When multiple pedestrians interact or overlap, the loss
of target features severely compromises the tracker's ability to maintain
stable trajectories. Traditional tracking methods, which typically rely on
full-body bounding box features extracted from {Re-ID} models and linear
constant-velocity motion assumptions, often struggle in severe occlusion
scenarios. To address these limitations, this work proposes an enhanced
tracking framework that leverages richer feature representations and a more
robust motion model. Specifically, the proposed method incorporates detection
features from both the regression and classification branches of an object
detector, embedding spatial and positional information directly into the
feature representations. To further mitigate occlusion challenges, a head
keypoint detection model is introduced, as the head is less prone to occlusion
compared to the full body. In terms of motion modeling, we propose an iterative
Kalman filtering approach designed to align with modern detector assumptions,
integrating 3D priors to better complete motion trajectories in complex scenes.
By combining these advancements in appearance and motion modeling, the proposed
method offers a more robust solution for multi-object tracking in crowded
environments where occlusions are prevalent.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于特征空间随机平滑的新型图像质量评估（IQA）模型认证防御方法，相比直接在输入空间添加噪声的传统方法，该方法在保持图像质量的同时提供鲁棒性保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在输入图像中直接添加高斯噪声会降低视觉质量，而新方法通过在特征空间应用噪声，既保留了图像保真度，又提供了鲁棒性保证。

Method: 通过分析主干网络Jacobian矩阵的最大奇异值，将特征空间噪声水平与输入空间扰动关联起来，支持全参考（FR）和无参考（NR）IQA模型，无需架构修改。

Result: 在两种基准数据集上验证，涉及六种常用FR和NR IQA模型，与五种先进认证防御方法对比，结果显示与主观质量分数的相关性提升高达30.9%。

Conclusion: 该方法计算高效（每图仅需一次主干前向传播），推理时间减少99.5%（无认证时）和20.6%（认证时），在保持图像质量的同时显著提升鲁棒性。

Abstract: We propose a novel certified defense method for Image Quality Assessment
(IQA) models based on randomized smoothing with noise applied in the feature
space rather than the input space. Unlike prior approaches that inject Gaussian
noise directly into input images, often degrading visual quality, our method
preserves image fidelity while providing robustness guarantees. To formally
connect noise levels in the feature space with corresponding input-space
perturbations, we analyze the maximum singular value of the backbone network's
Jacobian. Our approach supports both full-reference (FR) and no-reference (NR)
IQA models without requiring any architectural modifications, suitable for
various scenarios. It is also computationally efficient, requiring a single
backbone forward pass per image. Compared to previous methods, it reduces
inference time by 99.5% without certification and by 20.6% when certification
is applied. We validate our method with extensive experiments on two benchmark
datasets, involving six widely-used FR and NR IQA models and comparisons
against five state-of-the-art certified defenses. Our results demonstrate
consistent improvements in correlation with subjective quality scores by up to
30.9%.

Conclusion: AI辅助方法可解决临床试验操作中的低效问题，加速药物开发并降低成本，同时保持合规性。

Abstract: Clinical trial data cleaning represents a critical bottleneck in drug
development, with manual review processes struggling to manage exponentially
increasing data volumes and complexity. This paper presents Octozi, an
artificial intelligence-assisted platform that combines large language models
with domain-specific heuristics to transform clinical data review. In a
controlled experimental study with experienced clinical reviewers (n=10), we
demonstrate that AI assistance increased data cleaning throughput by 6.03-fold
while simultaneously decreasing cleaning errors from 54.67% to 8.48% (a
6.44-fold improvement). Crucially, the system reduced false positive queries by
15.48-fold, minimizing unnecessary site burden. These improvements were
consistent across reviewers regardless of experience level, suggesting broad
applicability. Our findings indicate that AI-assisted approaches can address
fundamental inefficiencies in clinical trial operations, potentially
accelerating drug development timelines and reducing costs while maintaining
regulatory compliance. This work establishes a framework for integrating AI
into safety-critical clinical workflows and demonstrates the transformative
potential of human-AI collaboration in pharmaceutical clinical trials.

Motivation: 现有结构剪枝方法常忽略参数间的相互联系，导致性能下降。

Method: 引入Jacobian Criterion评估参数重要性，提出Equivalent Pruning机制通过自动编码器保留原始连接的贡献。

Result: Jacobian Criterion在保持模型性能上优于其他指标，Equivalent Pruning有效减少微调后的性能下降。

Conclusion: Optimal Brain Connection框架在结构剪枝中表现出色，兼顾参数间联系和性能保留。

Abstract: Structural pruning has been widely studied for its effectiveness in
compressing neural networks. However, existing methods often neglect the
interconnections among parameters. To address this limitation, this paper
proposes a structural pruning framework termed Optimal Brain Connection. First,
we introduce the Jacobian Criterion, a first-order metric for evaluating the
saliency of structural parameters. Unlike existing first-order methods that
assess parameters in isolation, our criterion explicitly captures both
intra-component interactions and inter-layer dependencies. Second, we propose
the Equivalent Pruning mechanism, which utilizes autoencoders to retain the
contributions of all original connection--including pruned ones--during
fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that the Jacobian Criterion
outperforms several popular metrics in preserving model performance, while the
Equivalent Pruning mechanism effectively mitigates performance degradation
after fine-tuning. Code: https://github.com/ShaowuChen/Optimal_Brain_Connection

Conclusion: SSTGNN是一种高效、轻量且可扩展的解决方案，适用于实际部署。

Abstract: The proliferation of generative video models has made detecting AI-generated
and manipulated videos an urgent challenge. Existing detection approaches often
fail to generalize across diverse manipulation types due to their reliance on
isolated spatial, temporal, or spectral information, and typically require
large models to perform well. This paper introduces SSTGNN, a lightweight
Spatial-Spectral-Temporal Graph Neural Network framework that represents videos
as structured graphs, enabling joint reasoning over spatial inconsistencies,
temporal artifacts, and spectral distortions. SSTGNN incorporates learnable
spectral filters and temporal differential modeling into a graph-based
architecture, capturing subtle manipulation traces more effectively. Extensive
experiments on diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that SSTGNN not only
achieves superior performance in both in-domain and cross-domain settings, but
also offers strong robustness against unseen manipulations. Remarkably, SSTGNN
accomplishes these results with up to 42.4$\times$ fewer parameters than
state-of-the-art models, making it highly lightweight and scalable for
real-world deployment.

Abstract: As the volume of video content online grows exponentially, the demand for
moderation of unsafe videos has surpassed human capabilities, posing both
operational and mental health challenges. While recent studies demonstrated the
merits of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in various video
understanding tasks, their application to multimodal content moderation, a
domain that requires nuanced understanding of both visual and textual cues,
remains relatively underexplored. In this work, we benchmark the capabilities
of MLLMs in brand safety classification, a critical subset of content
moderation for safe-guarding advertising integrity. To this end, we introduce a
novel, multimodal and multilingual dataset, meticulously labeled by
professional reviewers in a multitude of risk categories. Through a detailed
comparative analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MLLMs such as Gemini,
GPT, and Llama in multimodal brand safety, and evaluate their accuracy and cost
efficiency compared to professional human reviewers. Furthermore, we present an
in-depth discussion shedding light on limitations of MLLMs and failure cases.
We are releasing our dataset alongside this paper to facilitate future research
on effective and responsible brand safety and content moderation.

Motivation: 解决部分标注数据集中模糊动作和未标注动作的挑战，特别是在神经科学等领域中常见的行为标注不完整问题。

Method: 提出两步方法：1) Granularity-Guided Segmentation Module (GGSM) 识别已知和未知动作的时间区间；2) Unknown Action Segment Assignment (UASA) 基于嵌入相似性为未知动作分配语义类别。

Result: 在Breakfast、50Salads和Desktop Assembly三个数据集上，该方法显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: Action Discovery方法有效解决了部分标注数据集中的动作识别问题，为模糊和未标注动作提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce Action Discovery, a novel setup within Temporal Action
Segmentation that addresses the challenge of defining and annotating ambiguous
actions and incomplete annotations in partially labeled datasets. In this
setup, only a subset of actions - referred to as known actions - is annotated
in the training data, while other unknown actions remain unlabeled. This
scenario is particularly relevant in domains like neuroscience, where
well-defined behaviors (e.g., walking, eating) coexist with subtle or
infrequent actions that are often overlooked, as well as in applications where
datasets are inherently partially annotated due to ambiguous or missing labels.
To address this problem, we propose a two-step approach that leverages the
known annotations to guide both the temporal and semantic granularity of
unknown action segments. First, we introduce the Granularity-Guided
Segmentation Module (GGSM), which identifies temporal intervals for both known
and unknown actions by mimicking the granularity of annotated actions. Second,
we propose the Unknown Action Segment Assignment (UASA), which identifies
semantically meaningful classes within the unknown actions, based on learned
embedding similarities. We systematically explore the proposed setting of
Action Discovery on three challenging datasets - Breakfast, 50Salads, and
Desktop Assembly - demonstrating that our method considerably improves upon
existing baselines.

Abstract: With the growing demands of AI-generated content (AIGC), the need for
high-quality, diverse, and scalable data has become increasingly crucial.
However, collecting large-scale real-world data remains costly and
time-consuming, hindering the development of downstream applications. While
some works attempt to collect task-specific data via a rendering process, most
approaches still rely on manual scene construction, limiting their scalability
and accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose Follow-Your-Instruction,
a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-driven framework for automatically
synthesizing high-quality 2D, 3D, and 4D data. Our
\textbf{Follow-Your-Instruction} first collects assets and their associated
descriptions through multimodal inputs using the MLLM-Collector. Then it
constructs 3D layouts, and leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for semantic
refinement through multi-view scenes with the MLLM-Generator and
MLLM-Optimizer, respectively. Finally, it uses MLLM-Planner to generate
temporally coherent future frames. We evaluate the quality of the generated
data through comprehensive experiments on the 2D, 3D, and 4D generative tasks.
The results show that our synthetic data significantly boosts the performance
of existing baseline models, demonstrating Follow-Your-Instruction's potential
as a scalable and effective data engine for generative intelligence.

Motivation: 解决VLP模型在细粒度定位和类别依赖建模上的不足，提升开放词汇多标签识别效果。

Method: 提出DART框架，包含自适应细化模块（ARM）和自适应转移模块（ATM），结合LLM知识进行类别关系建模。

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到最新最优性能。

Conclusion: DART通过自适应模块和外部知识整合，显著提升了开放词汇多标签识别的性能。

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Multi-Label Recognition (OV-MLR) aims to identify multiple
seen and unseen object categories within an image, requiring both precise
intra-class localization to pinpoint objects and effective inter-class
reasoning to model complex category dependencies. While Vision-Language
Pre-training (VLP) models offer a strong open-vocabulary foundation, they often
struggle with fine-grained localization under weak supervision and typically
fail to explicitly leverage structured relational knowledge beyond basic
semantics, limiting performance especially for unseen classes. To overcome
these limitations, we propose the Dual Adaptive Refinement Transfer (DART)
framework. DART enhances a frozen VLP backbone via two synergistic adaptive
modules. For intra-class refinement, an Adaptive Refinement Module (ARM)
refines patch features adaptively, coupled with a novel Weakly Supervised Patch
Selecting (WPS) loss that enables discriminative localization using only
image-level labels. Concurrently, for inter-class transfer, an Adaptive
Transfer Module (ATM) leverages a Class Relationship Graph (CRG), constructed
using structured knowledge mined from a Large Language Model (LLM), and employs
graph attention network to adaptively transfer relational information between
class representations. DART is the first framework, to our knowledge, to
explicitly integrate external LLM-derived relational knowledge for adaptive
inter-class transfer while simultaneously performing adaptive intra-class
refinement under weak supervision for OV-MLR. Extensive experiments on
challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our DART achieves new state-of-the-art
performance, validating its effectiveness.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉分词器在压缩比和重建保真度之间存在不足，WeTok旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用分组无查找量化（GQ）和生成解码（GD）技术，GQ提升效率与可扩展性，GD通过噪声变量建模视觉数据分布。

Result: 在ImageNet 50k验证集上，WeTok创下最低零样本rFID（0.12），最高压缩比模型（768）的rFID为3.49，优于同类方法。

Conclusion: WeTok在视觉生成任务中表现出色，为高效高保真视觉分词提供了新思路。

Abstract: Visual tokenizer is a critical component for vision generation. However, the
existing tokenizers often face unsatisfactory trade-off between compression
ratios and reconstruction fidelity. To fill this gap, we introduce a powerful
and concise WeTok tokenizer, which surpasses the previous leading tokenizers
via two core innovations. (1) Group-wise lookup-free Quantization (GQ). We
partition the latent features into groups, and perform lookup-free quantization
for each group. As a result, GQ can efficiently overcome memory and computation
limitations of prior tokenizers, while achieving a reconstruction breakthrough
with more scalable codebooks. (2) Generative Decoding (GD). Different from
prior tokenizers, we introduce a generative decoder with a prior of extra noise
variable. In this case, GD can probabilistically model the distribution of
visual data conditioned on discrete tokens, allowing WeTok to reconstruct
visual details, especially at high compression ratios. Extensive experiments on
mainstream benchmarks show superior performance of our WeTok. On the ImageNet
50k validation set, WeTok achieves a record-low zero-shot rFID (WeTok: 0.12 vs.
FLUX-VAE: 0.18 vs. SD-VAE 3.5: 0.19). Furthermore, our highest compression
model achieves a zero-shot rFID of 3.49 with a compression ratio of 768,
outperforming Cosmos (384) 4.57 which has only 50% compression rate of ours.

Result: 实验验证了LLaVA-RE框架的有效性。

Conclusion: LLaVA-RE为二元图像-文本相关性评估提供了可行的解决方案，展示了MLLM在此类任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Multimodal generative AI usually involves generating image or text responses
given inputs in another modality. The evaluation of image-text relevancy is
essential for measuring response quality or ranking candidate responses. In
particular, binary relevancy evaluation, i.e., ``Relevant'' vs. ``Not
Relevant'', is a fundamental problem. However, this is a challenging task
considering that texts have diverse formats and the definition of relevancy
varies in different scenarios. We find that Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) are an ideal choice to build such evaluators, as they can flexibly

paper, we present LLaVA-RE, a first attempt for binary image-text relevancy
evaluation with MLLM. It follows the LLaVA architecture and adopts detailed
task instructions and multimodal in-context samples. In addition, we propose a
novel binary relevancy data set that covers various tasks. Experimental results

TL;DR: Hi3DEval是一个针对3D生成内容的分层评估框架，结合对象级和部分级评估，并扩展了纹理评估以包括材料真实性。支持框架的Hi3DBench数据集和自动化评分系统在实验中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D内容质量评估方法主要依赖图像级指标，无法全面捕捉空间一致性、材料真实性和局部细节。

Method: 提出Hi3DEval框架，结合对象级和部分级评估，并引入材料真实性评估。构建Hi3DBench数据集和3D感知自动化评分系统。

Result: 实验表明，Hi3DEval在建模3D特性和与人类偏好对齐方面优于现有图像级指标。

Conclusion: Hi3DEval提供了一个可扩展的替代手动评估的方案，显著提升了3D内容质量评估的能力。

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in 3D content generation, quality assessment for the
generated 3D assets remains challenging. Existing methods mainly rely on
image-based metrics and operate solely at the object level, limiting their
ability to capture spatial coherence, material authenticity, and high-fidelity
local details. 1) To address these challenges, we introduce Hi3DEval, a
hierarchical evaluation framework tailored for 3D generative content. It
combines both object-level and part-level evaluation, enabling holistic
assessments across multiple dimensions as well as fine-grained quality
analysis. Additionally, we extend texture evaluation beyond aesthetic
appearance by explicitly assessing material realism, focusing on attributes
such as albedo, saturation, and metallicness. 2) To support this framework, we
construct Hi3DBench, a large-scale dataset comprising diverse 3D assets and
high-quality annotations, accompanied by a reliable multi-agent annotation
pipeline. We further propose a 3D-aware automated scoring system based on
hybrid 3D representations. Specifically, we leverage video-based
representations for object-level and material-subject evaluations to enhance
modeling of spatio-temporal consistency and employ pretrained 3D features for
part-level perception. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing image-based metrics in modeling 3D characteristics and
achieves superior alignment with human preference, providing a scalable
alternative to manual evaluations. The project page is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MOSEv2是一个更具挑战性的视频对象分割数据集，旨在推动真实场景下的研究，包含复杂场景和多样化挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集主要包含显著、主导和孤立的对象，限制了在真实场景中的泛化能力。MOSEv2旨在解决这一问题。

Method: MOSEv2包含5,024个视频和701,976个高质量掩码，涵盖200个类别的10,074个对象，引入了更复杂的场景和挑战。

Result: 20种VOS方法和9种跟踪方法在MOSEv2上表现显著下降，如SAM2从76.4%降至50.9%。

Conclusion: 当前VOS方法在真实复杂场景中仍有不足，MOSEv2为未来研究提供了更现实的基准。

Abstract: Video object segmentation (VOS) aims to segment specified target objects
throughout a video. Although state-of-the-art methods have achieved impressive
performance (e.g., 90+% J&F) on existing benchmarks such as DAVIS and
YouTube-VOS, these datasets primarily contain salient, dominant, and isolated
objects, limiting their generalization to real-world scenarios. To advance VOS
toward more realistic environments, coMplex video Object SEgmentation (MOSEv1)
was introduced to facilitate VOS research in complex scenes. Building on the
strengths and limitations of MOSEv1, we present MOSEv2, a significantly more
challenging dataset designed to further advance VOS methods under real-world
conditions. MOSEv2 consists of 5,024 videos and over 701,976 high-quality masks
for 10,074 objects across 200 categories. Compared to its predecessor, MOSEv2
introduces significantly greater scene complexity, including more frequent
object disappearance and reappearance, severe occlusions and crowding, smaller
objects, as well as a range of new challenges such as adverse weather (e.g.,
rain, snow, fog), low-light scenes (e.g., nighttime, underwater), multi-shot
sequences, camouflaged objects, non-physical targets (e.g., shadows,
reflections), scenarios requiring external knowledge, etc. We benchmark 20
representative VOS methods under 5 different settings and observe consistent
performance drops. For example, SAM2 drops from 76.4% on MOSEv1 to only 50.9%
on MOSEv2. We further evaluate 9 video object tracking methods and find similar
declines, demonstrating that MOSEv2 presents challenges across tasks. These
results highlight that despite high accuracy on existing datasets, current VOS
methods still struggle under real-world complexities. MOSEv2 is publicly
available at https://MOSE.video.

TL;DR: GAP是一种将原始点云转化为高保真3D高斯分布的新方法，利用文本指导和多视角优化框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补无色3D点云直接生成高斯分布的空白，提升渲染质量和效率。

Method: 采用多视角优化框架，结合深度感知图像扩散模型和表面锚定机制，确保几何精度和外观一致性。

Result: 在合成点云和真实扫描数据上均表现优异，适用于不同复杂度的场景。

Conclusion: GAP为点云到高斯的转换提供了高效且高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated its advantages in achieving
fast and high-quality rendering. As point clouds serve as a widely-used and
easily accessible form of 3D representation, bridging the gap between point
clouds and Gaussians becomes increasingly important. Recent studies have
explored how to convert the colored points into Gaussians, but directly
generating Gaussians from colorless 3D point clouds remains an unsolved
challenge. In this paper, we propose GAP, a novel approach that gaussianizes
raw point clouds into high-fidelity 3D Gaussians with text guidance. Our key
idea is to design a multi-view optimization framework that leverages a
depth-aware image diffusion model to synthesize consistent appearances across
different viewpoints. To ensure geometric accuracy, we introduce a
surface-anchoring mechanism that effectively constrains Gaussians to lie on the
surfaces of 3D shapes during optimization. Furthermore, GAP incorporates a
diffuse-based inpainting strategy that specifically targets at completing
hard-to-observe regions. We evaluate GAP on the Point-to-Gaussian generation
task across varying complexity levels, from synthetic point clouds to
challenging real-world scans, and even large-scale scenes. Project Page:

TL;DR: FaceAnonyMixer是一种可取消的人脸生成框架，通过混合真实人脸图像的潜在代码与可撤销密钥生成的合成代码，实现隐私保护，同时保持高识别精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着人脸识别技术的发展，隐私保护需求增加，现有方法无法满足生物特征模板保护的可撤销性、不可链接性和不可逆性要求。

Method: 利用预训练生成模型的潜在空间，混合真实人脸和合成代码，并通过多目标损失函数优化，生成高质量可取消人脸。

Result: 在基准数据集上，FaceAnonyMixer在商业API上实现了超过11%的识别精度提升，同时提供更强的隐私保护。

Conclusion: FaceAnonyMixer在保持高识别精度的同时，显著增强了隐私保护能力，满足了生物特征模板保护的所有要求。

Abstract: Advancements in face recognition (FR) technologies have amplified privacy
concerns, necessitating methods that protect identity while maintaining
recognition utility. Existing face anonymization methods typically focus on
obscuring identity but fail to meet the requirements of biometric template
protection, including revocability, unlinkability, and irreversibility. We
propose FaceAnonyMixer, a cancelable face generation framework that leverages
the latent space of a pre-trained generative model to synthesize
privacy-preserving face images. The core idea of FaceAnonyMixer is to
irreversibly mix the latent code of a real face image with a synthetic code
derived from a revocable key. The mixed latent code is further refined through
a carefully designed multi-objective loss to satisfy all cancelable biometric
requirements. FaceAnonyMixer is capable of generating high-quality cancelable
faces that can be directly matched using existing FR systems without requiring
any modifications. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
FaceAnonyMixer delivers superior recognition accuracy while providing
significantly stronger privacy protection, achieving over an 11% gain on
commercial API compared to recent cancelable biometric methods. Code is

TL;DR: NAEx是一个模型无关的框架，用于解释网络对齐模型的决策，通过识别关键子图和特征来提升可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络对齐模型的可解释性有限，难以理解其决策过程，特别是在高风险领域。NAEx旨在解决这一问题。

Method: NAEx通过可学习的边和特征掩码联合参数化图结构和特征空间，并引入优化目标确保解释忠实于原始预测。

Result: NAEx在基准数据集上表现出高效性和有效性，能够为未见数据生成解释。

Conclusion: NAEx提升了网络对齐模型的可解释性，为跨网络依赖关系的解释提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Network alignment (NA) identifies corresponding nodes across multiple
networks, with applications in domains like social networks, co-authorship, and
biology. Despite advances in alignment models, their interpretability remains
limited, making it difficult to understand alignment decisions and posing
challenges in building trust, particularly in high-stakes domains. To address
this, we introduce NAEx, a plug-and-play, model-agnostic framework that
explains alignment models by identifying key subgraphs and features influencing
predictions. NAEx addresses the key challenge of preserving the joint
cross-network dependencies on alignment decisions by: (1) jointly
parameterizing graph structures and feature spaces through learnable edge and
feature masks, and (2) introducing an optimization objective that ensures
explanations are both faithful to the original predictions and enable
meaningful comparisons of structural and feature-based similarities between
networks. NAEx is an inductive framework that efficiently generates NA
explanations for previously unseen data. We introduce evaluation metrics
tailored to alignment explainability and demonstrate NAEx's effectiveness and
efficiency on benchmark datasets by integrating it with four representative NA
models.

Motivation: 现有T2I模型在处理复杂指令、细粒度内容控制和语义一致性方面存在不足，而LVLM在跨模态理解和指令跟随方面表现出色。

Method: LumiGen结合IPPA模块（智能提示解析与增强）和IVFR模块（迭代视觉反馈与优化），通过闭环反馈机制提升图像生成质量。

Result: 在LongBench-T2I Benchmark上，LumiGen以3.08的平均分超越现有方法，尤其在文本渲染和姿势表达方面表现突出。

Conclusion: LVLM的集成显著提升了T2I模型的可控性和生成质量，验证了LumiGen框架的有效性。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) generation has made significant advancements with
diffusion models, yet challenges persist in handling complex instructions,
ensuring fine-grained content control, and maintaining deep semantic
consistency. Existing T2I models often struggle with tasks like accurate text
rendering, precise pose generation, or intricate compositional coherence.
Concurrently, Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated powerful
capabilities in cross-modal understanding and instruction following. We propose
LumiGen, a novel LVLM-enhanced iterative framework designed to elevate T2I
model performance, particularly in areas requiring fine-grained control,
through a closed-loop, LVLM-driven feedback mechanism. LumiGen comprises an
Intelligent Prompt Parsing & Augmentation (IPPA) module for proactive prompt
enhancement and an Iterative Visual Feedback & Refinement (IVFR) module, which
acts as a "visual critic" to iteratively correct and optimize generated images.
Evaluated on the challenging LongBench-T2I Benchmark, LumiGen achieves a
superior average score of 3.08, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.
Notably, our framework demonstrates significant improvements in critical
dimensions such as text rendering and pose expression, validating the
effectiveness of LVLM integration for more controllable and higher-quality
image generation.

Result: 框架在边缘约束下实现了加速收敛，同时支持可扩展的多用户个性化AIGC服务。

Conclusion: 该框架在计算效率和隐私保护方面表现优异，适用于边缘设备上的个性化内容生成。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have emerged as powerful tools for high-quality
content generation, yet their intensive computational requirements for
inference pose challenges for resource-constrained edge devices. Cloud-based
solutions aid in computation but often fall short in addressing privacy risks,
personalization efficiency, and communication costs in multi-user edge-AIGC
scenarios. To bridge this gap, we first analyze existing edge-AIGC applications
in personalized content synthesis, revealing their limitations in efficiency
and scalability. We then propose a novel cluster-aware hierarchical federated
aggregation framework. Based on parameter-efficient local fine-tuning via
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), the framework first clusters clients based on the
similarity of their uploaded task requirements, followed by an intra-cluster
aggregation for enhanced personalization at the server-side. Subsequently, an
inter-cluster knowledge interaction paradigm is implemented to enable
hybrid-style content generation across diverse clusters.Building upon federated
learning (FL) collaboration, our framework simultaneously trains personalized
models for individual users at the devices and a shared global model enhanced
with multiple LoRA adapters on the server,enabling efficient edge inference;
meanwhile, all prompts for clustering and inference are encoded prior to
transmission, thereby further mitigating the risk of plaintext leakage. Our
evaluations demonstrate that the framework achieves accelerated convergence
while maintaining practical viability for scalable multi-user personalized AIGC
services under edge constraints.

Motivation: 在生物医学、环境科学等领域，样本稀缺且数据收集成本高，传统FSL方法表现不佳，因此需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 构建了M3FD数据集（包含多种模态数据），并开发了M3F框架，通过微调LMMM提升FSL性能。

Result: M3F框架在FSL任务中表现优于传统元学习方法，并提供了开源工具以促进数据访问和可重复性。

Conclusion: M3FD和M3F为数据稀缺的科学领域提供了一种统一且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) is a machine learning paradigm that aims to
generalize models from a small number of labeled examples, typically fewer than
10 per class. FSL is particularly crucial in biomedical, environmental,
materials, and mechanical sciences, where samples are limited and data
collection is often prohibitively costly, time-consuming, or ethically
constrained. In this study, we present an innovative approach to FSL by
demonstrating that a Large Multi-Modal Model (LMMM), trained on a set of
independent tasks spanning diverse domains, task types, and input modalities,
can substantially improve the generalization of FSL models, outperforming
models based on conventional meta-learning on tasks of the same type. To
support this, we first constructed a Multi-Modal Model Few-shot Dataset (M3FD,
over 10K+ few-shot samples), which includes 2D RGB images, 2D/3D medical scans,
tabular and time-course datasets, from which we manually curated FSL tasks such
as classification. We further introduced M3F (Multi-Modal Model for Few-shot
learning framework), a novel Large Multi-Modal Model framework tailored for
data-constrained scientific applications. M3F supports a wide range of
scientific data types through a modular pipeline. By fine-tuning the model on
M3FD, M3F improves model performance, making LMMM feasible for real-world FSL
deployment. The source code is located at https://github.com/ptdang1001/M3F. To
democratize access to complex FSL data and promote reproducibility for public
usage, M3FD is paired with a flexible and user-friendly tool that enables
efficient querying, task-specific sampling, and preprocessing. Together, our
dataset and framework offer a unified, scalable solution that significantly
lowers the barrier to applying LMMMs in data-scarce scientific domains.

Result: 在多个数据集上，AttriLens-Mol显著提升了模型性能，优于监督微调模型和其他先进模型。

Conclusion: AttriLens-Mol能够有效提取相关分子属性，提升预测性能和可解释性，代码已开源。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in assisting molecular
property prediction tasks but often rely on human-crafted prompts and
chain-of-thought templates. While recent advanced large reasoning models like
DeepSeek-R1 employ reinforcement learning for an extended ``thinking'' process,
their reasoning can be verbose and lack relevance. We introduce AttriLens-Mol,
an attribute-guided reinforcement learning framework for molecular property
prediction with LLMs. AttriLens-Mol steers the model's reasoning by using: (1)
a format reward encouraging attribute-based structured output, (2) a count
reward to avoid enumerating irrelevant attributes, and (3) a rationality reward
using advanced LLMs and RDKit to verify the relatedness of the generated
attributes. This approach implicitly elicits the model's inherent knowledge of
relevant molecular attributes during reasoning, enables making predictions for
the molecular property more effectively. Experiments on both in-distribution
and out-of-distribution datasets show that, training both 7B-size
R1-Distilled-Qwen2.5 and R1-Distilled-LLaMA3.1 models on 4,000 samples with our
proposed AttriLens-Mol method significantly boosts the performance, getting
comparable or better results than supervised fine-tuning models
(Mol-Instructions, ChemDFM, etc.) and advanced models (GPT-3.5, GPT-4o,
DeepSeek-V3, DeepSeek-R1, etc.). Further, our extracted attributes for the
target property, when used as features for an interpretable decision tree
model, yield superior performance compared to attributes generated by prompting
LLMs. This shows that AttriLens-Mol effectively elicits more relevant and
predictive molecular attributes, leading to enhanced interpretability and
performance for property prediction. We release the code in
https://github.com/szu-tera/AttriLens-Mol.

Motivation: 解决多模态时间序列数据中文本模态的干扰问题，现有方法常忽略文本数据的固有扰动，导致性能下降。

Method: 提出PA-RNet，包含扰动感知投影模块和跨模态注意力机制，分离噪声并保留语义信息。

Result: 理论证明PA-RNet的稳定性，实验表明其在多领域和时间设置下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PA-RNet能有效处理文本噪声，提升多模态时间序列预测的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: In real-world applications, multimodal time series data often suffer from
interference, especially in the textual modality. Existing methods for
multimodal time series forecasting often neglect the inherent perturbations
within textual data, where irrelevant, noisy, or ambiguous content can
significantly degrade model performance, particularly when the noise exhibits
varying intensity or stems from structural inconsistencies. To address this
challenge, we propose PA-RNet (Perturbation-Aware Reasoning Network for
Multimodal Time Series Forecasting), a robust multimodal forecasting framework.
PA-RNet features a perturbation-aware projection module and a cross-modal
attention mechanism to effectively separate noise from the textual embeddings
while maintaining semantically meaningful representations, thereby enhancing
the model's generalization ability. Theoretically, we establish the Lipschitz
continuity of PA-RNet with respect to textual inputs and prove that the
proposed perturbation module can reduce expected prediction error, offering
strong guarantees of stability under noisy conditions. Furthermore, we
introduce a textual perturbation pipeline that can be seamlessly incorporated
into existing multimodal time series forecasting tasks, allowing for systematic
evaluation of the model's robustness in the presence of varying levels of
textual noise. Extensive experiments across diverse domains and temporal
settings demonstrate that PA-RNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines.

Conclusion: MoMA为多模态EHR数据的临床预测提供了一种高效且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal electronic health record (EHR) data provide richer, complementary
insights into patient health compared to single-modality data. However,
effectively integrating diverse data modalities for clinical prediction
modeling remains challenging due to the substantial data requirements. We
introduce a novel architecture, Mixture-of-Multimodal-Agents (MoMA), designed
to leverage multiple large language model (LLM) agents for clinical prediction
tasks using multimodal EHR data. MoMA employs specialized LLM agents
("specialist agents") to convert non-textual modalities, such as medical images
and laboratory results, into structured textual summaries. These summaries,
together with clinical notes, are combined by another LLM ("aggregator agent")
to generate a unified multimodal summary, which is then used by a third LLM
("predictor agent") to produce clinical predictions. Evaluating MoMA on three
prediction tasks using real-world datasets with different modality combinations
and prediction settings, MoMA outperforms current state-of-the-art methods,
highlighting its enhanced accuracy and flexibility across various tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖计算昂贵的搜索算法或局部启发式代理（如Hessian），无法捕捉量化误差的全局影响。

Method: 通过单次前向传播量化每层并测量其对后续层互信息的变化，将比特分配问题转化为整数线性规划。

Result: 在ImageNet上，MobileNetV2和ResNet18的准确率提升1%，压缩率分别达14X和10.66X。

Conclusion: InfoQ在搜索效率和准确性上优于现有方法，适用于资源受限设备。

Abstract: Mixed-precision quantization (MPQ) is crucial for deploying deep neural
networks on resource-constrained devices, but finding the optimal bit-width for
each layer represents a complex combinatorial optimization problem. Current
state-of-the-art methods rely on computationally expensive search algorithms or
local sensitivity heuristic proxies like the Hessian, which fail to capture the
cascading global effects of quantization error. In this work, we argue that the
quantization sensitivity of a layer should not be measured by its local
properties, but by its impact on the information flow throughout the entire
network. We introduce InfoQ, a novel framework for MPQ that is training-free in
the bit-width search phase. InfoQ assesses layer sensitivity by quantizing each
layer at different bit-widths and measuring, through a single forward pass, the
resulting change in mutual information in the subsequent layers. This
quantifies how much each layer quantization impacts the network information
flow. The resulting scores are used to formulate bit-width allocation as an
integer linear programming problem, which is solved efficiently to minimize
total sensitivity under a given budget (e.g., model size or BitOps). Our
retraining-free search phase provides a superior search-time/accuracy trade-off
(using two orders of magnitude less data compared to state-of-the-art methods
such as LIMPQ), while yielding up to a 1% accuracy improvement for MobileNetV2
and ResNet18 on ImageNet at high compression rates (14X and 10.66X).

Conclusion: LLMs在临床决策中需谨慎应用，建议结合提示工程和生理建模以提高安全性和有效性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL)-based dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs) hold
promise for automating complex clinical decision-making, yet their practical
deployment remains hindered by the intensive engineering required to inject
clinical knowledge and ensure patient safety. Recent advancements in large
language models (LLMs) suggest a complementary approach, where implicit prior
knowledge and clinical heuristics are naturally embedded through linguistic
prompts without requiring environment-specific training. In this study, we
rigorously evaluate open-source LLMs as dynamic insulin dosing agents in an in
silico Type 1 diabetes simulator, comparing their zero-shot inference
performance against small neural network-based RL agents (SRAs) explicitly
trained for the task. Our results indicate that carefully designed zero-shot
prompts enable smaller LLMs (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B) to achieve comparable or
superior clinical performance relative to extensively trained SRAs,
particularly in stable patient cohorts. However, LLMs exhibit notable
limitations, such as overly aggressive insulin dosing when prompted with
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, highlighting critical failure modes including
arithmetic hallucination, temporal misinterpretation, and inconsistent clinical
logic. Incorporating explicit reasoning about latent clinical states (e.g.,
meals) yielded minimal performance gains, underscoring the current model's
limitations in capturing complex, hidden physiological dynamics solely through
textual inference. Our findings advocate for cautious yet optimistic
integration of LLMs into clinical workflows, emphasising the necessity of
targeted prompt engineering, careful validation, and potentially hybrid
approaches that combine linguistic reasoning with structured physiological
modelling to achieve safe, robust, and clinically effective decision-support
systems.

*Lin Jiang,Dahai Yu,Rongchao Xu,Tian Tang,Guang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为EPOPR的公平感知电力恢复策略，通过预测-优化框架解决现有方法中的效率与公平性问题，实验表明其显著减少了停电时间和社区间的不公平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 极端天气事件频发，现有电力恢复决策基于请求量，导致弱势社区因请求较少而恢复较慢，存在不公平问题。

Method: 设计了EPOPR框架，包含公平一致性分位数回归和时空注意力强化学习，以预测修复时长并实现公平决策。

Result: EPOPR将平均停电时间减少3.60%，社区间不公平性降低14.19%。

Conclusion: EPOPR在效率和公平性上优于现有方法，为电力恢复提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: The increasing frequency of extreme weather events, such as hurricanes,
highlights the urgent need for efficient and equitable power system
restoration. Many electricity providers make restoration decisions primarily
based on the volume of power restoration requests from each region. However,
our data-driven analysis reveals significant disparities in request submission
volume, as disadvantaged communities tend to submit fewer restoration requests.
This disparity makes the current restoration solution inequitable, leaving
these communities vulnerable to extended power outages. To address this, we aim
to propose an equity-aware power restoration strategy that balances both
restoration efficiency and equity across communities. However, achieving this
goal is challenging for two reasons: the difficulty of predicting repair
durations under dataset heteroscedasticity, and the tendency of reinforcement
learning agents to favor low-uncertainty actions, which potentially undermine
equity. To overcome these challenges, we design a predict-then-optimize
framework called EPOPR with two key components: (1) Equity-Conformalized
Quantile Regression for uncertainty-aware repair duration prediction, and (2)
Spatial-Temporal Attentional RL that adapts to varying uncertainty levels
across regions for equitable decision-making. Experimental results show that
our EPOPR effectively reduces the average power outage duration by 3.60% and
decreases inequity between different communities by 14.19% compared to
state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: 论文提出F3CRec框架，结合联邦学习和持续学习，解决推荐系统中隐私保护与动态数据流的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦推荐方法无法处理动态数据流，而持续学习方法又需要集中数据访问，因此需要一种既能保护隐私又能适应动态用户偏好的解决方案。

Method: 提出F3CRec框架，包含客户端自适应重放记忆和服务器端项目级时间均值两个关键组件。

Result: 实验表明F3CRec在联邦环境下能长期保持推荐质量。

Conclusion: F3CRec成功整合了联邦学习和持续学习，为隐私保护的动态推荐系统提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The increasing emphasis on privacy in recommendation systems has led to the
adoption of Federated Learning (FL) as a privacy-preserving solution, enabling
collaborative training without sharing user data. While Federated
Recommendation (FedRec) effectively protects privacy, existing methods struggle
with non-stationary data streams, failing to maintain consistent recommendation
quality over time. On the other hand, Continual Learning Recommendation (CLRec)
methods address evolving user preferences but typically assume centralized data
access, making them incompatible with FL constraints. To bridge this gap, we
introduce Federated Continual Recommendation (FCRec), a novel task that
integrates FedRec and CLRec, requiring models to learn from streaming data
while preserving privacy. As a solution, we propose F3CRec, a framework
designed to balance knowledge retention and adaptation under the strict
constraints of FCRec. F3CRec introduces two key components: Adaptive Replay
Memory on the client side, which selectively retains past preferences based on
user-specific shifts, and Item-wise Temporal Mean on the server side, which
integrates new knowledge while preserving prior information. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that F3CRec outperforms existing approaches in
maintaining recommendation quality over time in a federated environment.

TL;DR: HCRide是一个基于多智能体强化学习的人本主义网约车系统，通过平衡乘客公平性和司机偏好，提升系统效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有网约车系统过于关注运营商收入，忽略了乘客和司机的体验，因此需要设计一个兼顾多方利益的系统。

Method: 提出HCRide系统，采用Harmonization-oriented Actor-Bi-Critic（Habic）算法，包含多智能体竞争机制、动态Actor网络和Bi-Critic网络。

Result: 在深圳和纽约的真实数据测试中，HCRide将系统效率提升2.02%，公平性提升5.39%，司机偏好提升10.21%。

Conclusion: HCRide成功平衡了系统效率、乘客公平性和司机偏好，为网约车系统设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Order dispatch systems play a vital role in ride-hailing services, which
directly influence operator revenue, driver profit, and passenger experience.
Most existing work focuses on improving system efficiency in terms of operator
revenue, which may cause a bad experience for both passengers and drivers.
Hence, in this work, we aim to design a human-centered ride-hailing system by
considering both passenger fairness and driver preference without compromising
the overall system efficiency. However, it is nontrivial to achieve this target
due to the potential conflicts between passenger fairness and driver preference
since optimizing one may sacrifice the other. To address this challenge, we
design HCRide, a Human-Centered Ride-hailing system based on a novel
multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm called Harmonization-oriented
Actor-Bi-Critic (Habic), which includes three major components (i.e., a
multi-agent competition mechanism, a dynamic Actor network, and a Bi-Critic
network) to optimize system efficiency and passenger fairness with driver
preference consideration. We extensively evaluate our HCRide using two
real-world ride-hailing datasets from Shenzhen and New York City. Experimental
results show our HCRide effectively improves system efficiency by 2.02%,
fairness by 5.39%, and driver preference by 10.21% compared to state-of-the-art
baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经时间点过程模型多为自回归式，效率低且长时预测误差累积严重。

Method: 采用连续和离散流匹配技术，联合建模事件间时间和事件类型，避免顺序解码。

Result: 在六个真实世界基准测试中，模型在准确性和生成效率上均优于自回归和扩散基线。

Conclusion: 流匹配框架为长时程标记事件序列建模提供了一种高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Modeling long horizon marked event sequences is a fundamental challenge in
many real-world applications, including healthcare, finance, and user behavior
modeling. Existing neural temporal point process models are typically
autoregressive, predicting the next event one step at a time, which limits
their efficiency and leads to error accumulation in long-range forecasting. In
this work, we propose a unified flow matching framework for marked temporal
point processes that enables non-autoregressive, joint modeling of inter-event
times and event types, via continuous and discrete flow matching. By learning
continuous-time flows for both components, our method generates coherent long
horizon event trajectories without sequential decoding. We evaluate our model
on six real-world benchmarks and demonstrate significant improvements over
autoregressive and diffusion-based baselines in both accuracy and generation
efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CAN协议缺乏内置安全性，易受网络攻击，因此需要高效的入侵检测方法。

Method: 采用变分图自编码器（VGAE）进行结构异常检测，结合知识蒸馏图注意力网络（KD-GAT）进行分类，通过图序列建模时序和关系依赖。

Result: 在六个公开CAN数据集上测试，F1分数平均提升16.2%，参数减少96%的同时保持高性能。

Conclusion: 该框架在CAN网络安全中表现出色，尤其适用于高度不平衡数据集。

Abstract: The Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol is a standard for in-vehicle
communication but remains susceptible to cyber-attacks due to its lack of
built-in security. This paper presents a multi-stage intrusion detection
framework leveraging unsupervised anomaly detection and supervised graph
learning tailored for automotive CAN traffic. Our architecture combines a
Variational Graph Autoencoder (VGAE) for structural anomaly detection with a
Knowledge-Distilled Graph Attention Network (KD-GAT) for robust attack
classification. CAN bus activity is encoded as graph sequences to model
temporal and relational dependencies. The pipeline applies VGAE-based selective
undersampling to address class imbalance, followed by GAT classification with
optional score-level fusion. The compact student GAT achieves 96% parameter
reduction compared to the teacher model while maintaining strong predictive
performance. Experiments on six public CAN intrusion datasets--Car-Hacking,
Car-Survival, and can-train-and-test--demonstrate competitive accuracy and
efficiency, with average improvements of 16.2% in F1-score over existing
methods, particularly excelling on highly imbalanced datasets with up to 55%
F1-score improvements.

Motivation: 尽管OPTQ在实践中有广泛应用，但缺乏严格的理论保证，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过分析OPTQ的迭代过程，推导出2-范数误差界，并扩展到随机变体的无穷范数误差界，同时扩展到Qronos算法。

Result: 提供了OPTQ和Qronos的误差界，解释了其设计选择的合理性，并为参数选择提供了指导。

Conclusion: 本文为OPTQ和Qronos提供了理论支持，有助于优化其实际应用。

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has become a crucial tool for reducing the
memory and compute costs of modern deep neural networks, including large
language models (LLMs). Among PTQ algorithms, the OPTQ framework-also known as
GPTQ-has emerged as a leading method due to its computational efficiency and
strong empirical performance. Despite its widespread adoption, however, OPTQ
lacks rigorous quantitative theoretical guarantees. This paper presents the
first quantitative error bounds for both deterministic and stochastic variants
of OPTQ, as well as for Qronos, a recent related state-of-the-art PTQ
algorithm. We analyze how OPTQ's iterative procedure induces quantization error
and derive non-asymptotic 2-norm error bounds that depend explicitly on the
calibration data and a regularization parameter that OPTQ uses. Our analysis
provides theoretical justification for several practical design choices,
including the widely used heuristic of ordering features by decreasing norm, as
well as guidance for selecting the regularization parameter. For the stochastic
variant, we establish stronger infinity-norm error bounds, which enable control
over the required quantization alphabet and are particularly useful for
downstream layers and nonlinearities. Finally, we extend our analysis to
Qronos, providing new theoretical bounds, for both its deterministic and
stochastic variants, that help explain its empirical advantages.

TL;DR: Agnostics是一种语言无关的后训练管道，通过观察代码的外部行为来验证多语言代码，避免了针对每种语言的单独工程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源编程语言在后训练阶段的数据集、测试框架和RL基础设施需求问题。

Method: 将单元测试数据集转换为I/O格式，提供配置指导验证器编译和运行目标语言，并应用RLVR在代码执行环境中。

Result: 在五种低资源语言上显著提升模型性能，甚至超越更大规模的模型，并创下新的SOTA结果。

Conclusion: Agnostics简化了多语言RL后训练，提供了可扩展的解决方案和开源资源。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) already excel at writing code in high-resource
languages such as Python and JavaScript, yet stumble on low-resource languages
that remain essential to science and engineering. Besides the obvious shortage
of pre-training data, post-training itself is a bottleneck: every new language
seems to require new datasets, test harnesses, and reinforcement-learning (RL)
infrastructure.
  We introduce Agnostics, a language-agnostic post-training pipeline that
eliminates this per-language engineering. The key idea is to judge code solely
by its externally observable behavior, so a single verifier can test solutions
written in any language. Concretely, we (i) use an LLM to rewrite existing
unit-test datasets into an I/O format, (ii) supply a short configuration that
tells the verifier how to compile and run a target language, and (iii) apply
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) in a robust code
execution environment.
  Applied to five low-resource languages--Lua, Julia, R, OCaml, and
Fortran--Agnostics (1) improves Qwen-3 4B to performance that rivals other
16B-70B open-weight models; (2) scales cleanly to larger and diverse model
families (Qwen-3 8B, DeepSeek Coder 6.7B Instruct, Phi 4 Mini); and (3) for
${\le} 16$B parameter models, sets new state-of-the-art pass@1 results on
MultiPL-E and a new multi-language version LiveCodeBench that we introduce.
  We will release the language-agnostic training datasets (Ag-MBPP-X,
Ag-Codeforces-X, Ag-LiveCodeBench-X), training code, and ready-to-use
configurations, making RL post-training in any programming language as simple
as editing a short YAML file.

Motivation: 现有Fourier神经算子（FNO）在频域卷积方面表现优异，但其基于傅里叶变换的周期性假设存在局限性，且缺乏对信号瞬时特征的显式建模。

Method: HNO通过希尔伯特变换将输入信号映射为解析表示，显式提取瞬时振幅和相位信息，并在希尔伯特变换后的表示上应用谱卷积。

Result: HNO能够更有效地建模因果、相位敏感和非平稳系统的算子。

Conclusion: HNO结合了信号处理的强归纳偏置，为神经算子提供了一种新的设计思路，适用于更广泛的PDE问题。

Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as a powerful, data-driven paradigm for
learning solution operators of partial differential equations (PDEs).
State-of-the-art architectures, such as the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), have
achieved remarkable success by performing convolutions in the frequency domain,
making them highly effective for a wide range of problems. However, this method
has some limitations, including the periodicity assumption of the Fourier
transform. In addition, there are other methods of analysing a signal, beyond
phase and amplitude perspective, and provide us with other useful information
to learn an effective network. We introduce the \textbf{Hilbert Neural Operator
(HNO)}, a new neural operator architecture to address some advantages by
incorporating a strong inductive bias from signal processing. HNO operates by
first mapping the input signal to its analytic representation via the Hilbert
transform, thereby making instantaneous amplitude and phase information
explicit features for the learning process. The core learnable operation -- a
spectral convolution -- is then applied to this Hilbert-transformed
representation. We hypothesize that this architecture enables HNO to model
operators more effectively for causal, phase-sensitive, and non-stationary
systems. We formalize the HNO architecture and provide the theoretical
motivation for its design, rooted in analytic signal theory.

Motivation: 研究是否可以直接在概率测度上实现动态，以扩展对神经网络的理解和应用。

Method: 使用高斯混合模型和Wasserstein梯度流理论，推导出概率测度的训练动态，并引入高斯混合层。

Result: GM层在简单分类任务中表现与传统全连接网络相当，且行为显著不同。

Conclusion: 高斯混合层为神经网络架构提供了新的可能性，展示了与传统方法不同的动态行为。

Abstract: The mean-field theory for two-layer neural networks considers infinitely wide
networks that are linearly parameterized by a probability measure over the
parameter space. This nonparametric perspective has significantly advanced both
the theoretical and conceptual understanding of neural networks, with
substantial efforts made to validate its applicability to networks of moderate
width. In this work, we explore the opposite direction, investigating whether
dynamics can be directly implemented over probability measures. Specifically,
we employ Gaussian mixture models as a flexible and expressive parametric
family of distributions together with the theory of Wasserstein gradient flows
to derive training dynamics for such measures. Our approach introduces a new
type of layer -- the Gaussian mixture (GM) layer -- that can be integrated into
neural network architectures. As a proof of concept, we validate our proposal
through experiments on simple classification tasks, where a GM layer achieves
test performance comparable to that of a two-layer fully connected network.
Furthermore, we examine the behavior of these dynamics and demonstrate
numerically that GM layers exhibit markedly different behavior compared to
classical fully connected layers, even when the latter are large enough to be
considered in the mean-field regime.

Abstract: Air pollution is a global hazard, and as of 2023, 94\% of the world's
population is exposed to unsafe pollution levels. Surface Ozone (O3), an
important pollutant, and the drivers of its trends are difficult to model, and
traditional physics-based models fall short in their practical use for scales
relevant to human-health impacts. Deep Learning-based emulators have shown
promise in capturing complex climate patterns, but overall lack the
interpretability necessary to support critical decision making for policy
changes and public health measures. We implement an uncertainty-aware U-Net
architecture to predict the Multi-mOdel Multi-cOnstituent Chemical data
assimilation (MOMO-Chem) model's surface ozone residuals (bias) using Bayesian
and quantile regression methods. We demonstrate the capability of our
techniques in regional estimation of bias in North America and Europe for June
2019. We highlight the uncertainty quantification (UQ) scores between our two
UQ methodologies and discern which ground stations are optimal and sub-optimal
candidates for MOMO-Chem bias correction, and evaluate the impact of land-use
information in surface ozone residual modeling.

Abstract: Air pollution is the world's largest environmental risk factor for human
disease and premature death, resulting in more than 6 million permature deaths
in 2019. Currently, there is still a challenge to model one of the most
important air pollutants, surface ozone, particularly at scales relevant for
human health impacts, with the drivers of global ozone trends at these scales
largely unknown, limiting the practical use of physics-based models. We employ
a 2D Convolutional Neural Network based architecture that estimate surface
ozone MOMO-Chem model residuals, referred to as model bias. We demonstrate the
potential of this technique in North America and Europe, highlighting its
ability better to capture physical model residuals compared to a traditional
machine learning method. We assess the impact of incorporating land use
information from high-resolution satellite imagery to improve model estimates.
Importantly, we discuss how our results can improve our scientific
understanding of the factors impacting ozone bias at urban scales that can be
used to improve environmental policy.

Motivation: 准确的水位预测对生态系统管理至关重要，但现有深度学习模型在水文领域的应用不足且泛化能力有限。

Result: 在Everglades真实数据上验证，RAF显著提高了水位预测准确性。

Conclusion: RAF展示了在环境水文中的潜力，为自适应AI方法在生态系统管理中的广泛应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Accurate water level forecasting is crucial for managing ecosystems such as
the Everglades, a subtropical wetland vital for flood mitigation, drought
management, water resource planning, and biodiversity conservation. While
recent advances in deep learning, particularly time series foundation models,
have demonstrated success in general-domain forecasting, their application in
hydrology remains underexplored. Furthermore, they often struggle to generalize
across diverse unseen datasets and domains, due to the lack of effective
mechanisms for adaptation. To address this gap, we introduce
Retrieval-Augmented Forecasting (RAF) into the hydrology domain, proposing a
framework that retrieves historically analogous multivariate hydrological
episodes to enrich the model input before forecasting. By maintaining an
external archive of past observations, RAF identifies and incorporates relevant
patterns from historical data, thereby enhancing contextual awareness and
predictive accuracy without requiring the model for task-specific retraining or
fine-tuning. Furthermore, we explore and compare both similarity-based and
mutual information-based RAF methods. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on
real-world data from the Everglades, demonstrating that the RAF framework
yields substantial improvements in water level forecasting accuracy. This study
highlights the potential of RAF approaches in environmental hydrology and paves
the way for broader adoption of adaptive AI methods by domain experts in
ecosystem management. The code and data are available at

Abstract: Reliable evaluation of machine learning models for neonatal seizure detection
is critical for clinical adoption. Current practices often rely on inconsistent
and biased metrics, hindering model comparability and interpretability.
Expert-level claims about AI performance are frequently made without rigorous
validation, raising concerns about their reliability. This study aims to
systematically evaluate common performance metrics and propose best practices
tailored to the specific challenges of neonatal seizure detection. Using real
and synthetic seizure annotations, we assessed standard performance metrics,
consensus strategies, and human-expert level equivalence tests under varying
class imbalance, inter-rater agreement, and number of raters. Matthews and
Pearson's correlation coefficients outperformed the area under the curve in
reflecting performance under class imbalance. Consensus types are sensitive to
the number of raters and agreement level among them. Among human-expert level
equivalence tests, the multi-rater Turing test using Fleiss k best captured
expert-level AI performance. We recommend reporting: (1) at least one balanced
metric, (2) Sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV, (3) Multi-rater Turing test
results using Fleiss k, and (4) All the above on held-out validation set. This
proposed framework provides an important prerequisite to clinical validation by
enabling a thorough and honest appraisal of AI methods for neonatal seizure
detection.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of transfer learning has revolutionized machine
learning by enabling efficient adaptation of pre-trained models to new domains.
However, the reliability of these adaptations remains poorly understood,
particularly when using adaptive data selection strategies that dynamically
prioritize training examples. We present a comprehensive theoretical and
empirical analysis of replicability in transfer learning, introducing a
mathematical framework that quantifies the fundamental trade-off between
adaptation effectiveness and result consistency. Our key contribution is the
formalization of selection sensitivity ($\Delta_Q$), a measure that captures
how adaptive selection strategies respond to perturbations in training data. We
prove that replicability failure probability: the likelihood that two
independent training runs produce models differing in performance by more than
a threshold, increases quadratically with selection sensitivity while
decreasing exponentially with sample size. Through extensive experiments on the
MultiNLI corpus using six adaptive selection strategies - ranging from uniform
sampling to gradient-based selection - we demonstrate that this theoretical
relationship holds precisely in practice. Our results reveal that highly
adaptive strategies like gradient-based and curriculum learning achieve
superior task performance but suffer from high replicability failure rates,
while less adaptive approaches maintain failure rates below 7%. Crucially, we
show that source domain pretraining provides a powerful mitigation mechanism,
reducing failure rates by up to 30% while preserving performance gains. These
findings establish principled guidelines for practitioners to navigate the
performance-replicability trade-off and highlight the need for
replicability-aware design in modern transfer learning systems.

### [200] [Advancing Hate Speech Detection with Transformers: Insights from the MetaHate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04913)
*Santosh Chapagain,Shah Muhammad Hamdi,Soukaina Filali Boubrahimi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了基于Transformer的模型在仇恨言论检测中的应用，使用MetaHate数据集评估了BERT、RoBERTa、GPT-2和ELECTRA等模型，其中微调后的ELECTRA表现最佳（F1分数：0.8980）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 仇恨言论在社交媒体上广泛存在且危害严重，需要开发高效的自动化检测方法。现有的深度学习方法（如RNN、LSTM、CNN）存在局限性，因此研究转向Transformer模型。

Method: 使用MetaHate数据集（包含36个数据集和120万样本），评估了BERT、RoBERTa、GPT-2和ELECTRA等Transformer模型。

Result: 微调后的ELECTRA模型表现最佳，F1分数为0.8980。研究还发现分类错误主要源于讽刺、编码语言和标签噪声。

Conclusion: Transformer模型（尤其是ELECTRA）在仇恨言论检测中表现优异，但仍需解决讽刺和编码语言等挑战。

Abstract: Hate speech is a widespread and harmful form of online discourse,
encompassing slurs and defamatory posts that can have serious social,
psychological, and sometimes physical impacts on targeted individuals and
communities. As social media platforms such as X (formerly Twitter), Facebook,
Instagram, Reddit, and others continue to facilitate widespread communication,
they also become breeding grounds for hate speech, which has increasingly been
linked to real-world hate crimes. Addressing this issue requires the
development of robust automated methods to detect hate speech in diverse social
media environments. Deep learning approaches, such as vanilla recurrent neural
networks (RNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM), and convolutional neural
networks (CNNs), have achieved good results, but are often limited by issues
such as long-term dependencies and inefficient parallelization. This study
represents the comprehensive exploration of transformer-based models for hate
speech detection using the MetaHate dataset--a meta-collection of 36 datasets
with 1.2 million social media samples. We evaluate multiple state-of-the-art
transformer models, including BERT, RoBERTa, GPT-2, and ELECTRA, with
fine-tuned ELECTRA achieving the highest performance (F1 score: 0.8980). We
also analyze classification errors, revealing challenges with sarcasm, coded
language, and label noise.

*Chenkai Wu,Yuanyuan Qi,Xiaohao Yang,Jueqing Lu,Gang Liu,Wray Buntine,Lan Du*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ALScope是一个新的深度主动学习平台，整合了10个数据集和21种算法，支持灵活配置实验条件，用于全面评估算法性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏统一的平台，难以公平系统地评估深度主动学习算法在复杂场景（如分布偏移和数据不平衡）下的表现。

Method: 开发了ALScope平台，整合多领域数据集和算法，支持灵活配置实验条件（如OOD样本比例和类别不平衡比例）。

Result: 实验表明，算法性能因领域和任务设置而异；在非标准场景（如不平衡和开放集）中算法有待改进；部分算法性能好但选择时间长。

Conclusion: ALScope为深度主动学习提供了全面的评估平台，揭示了算法在不同场景下的表现和改进空间。

Abstract: Deep Active Learning (DAL) reduces annotation costs by selecting the most
informative unlabeled samples during training. As real-world applications
become more complex, challenges stemming from distribution shifts (e.g.,
open-set recognition) and data imbalance have gained increasing attention,
prompting the development of numerous DAL algorithms. However, the lack of a
unified platform has hindered fair and systematic evaluation under diverse
conditions. Therefore, we present a new DAL platform ALScope for classification
tasks, integrating 10 datasets from computer vision (CV) and natural language
processing (NLP), and 21 representative DAL algorithms, including both
classical baselines and recent approaches designed to handle challenges such as
distribution shifts and data imbalance. This platform supports flexible
configuration of key experimental factors, ranging from algorithm and dataset
choices to task-specific factors like out-of-distribution (OOD) sample ratio,
and class imbalance ratio, enabling comprehensive and realistic evaluation. We
conduct extensive experiments on this platform under various settings. Our
findings show that: (1) DAL algorithms' performance varies significantly across
domains and task settings; (2) in non-standard scenarios such as imbalanced and
open-set settings, DAL algorithms show room for improvement and require further
investigation; and (3) some algorithms achieve good performance, but require
significantly longer selection time.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为REINA的新方法，通过信息理论优化SimulST系统的延迟与翻译质量权衡，并在多语言任务中取得SOTA结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SimulST系统需要在实时翻译中平衡延迟与翻译质量，现有方法难以高效解决这一问题。

Method: 提出REINA损失函数，基于信息理论训练自适应策略，利用非流式翻译模型优化流式翻译。

Result: 在多语言任务中，REINA显著提升了延迟与质量的权衡，最高提升21%，并达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: REINA为SimulST系统提供了一种高效的优化方法，显著提升了实时翻译的性能。

Abstract: Simultaneous Speech Translation (SimulST) systems stream in audio while
simultaneously emitting translated text or speech. Such systems face the
significant challenge of balancing translation quality and latency. We
introduce a strategy to optimize this tradeoff: wait for more input only if you
gain information by doing so. Based on this strategy, we present Regularized
Entropy INformation Adaptation (REINA), a novel loss to train an adaptive
policy using an existing non-streaming translation model. We derive REINA from
information theory principles and show that REINA helps push the reported
Pareto frontier of the latency/quality tradeoff over prior works. Utilizing
REINA, we train a SimulST model on French, Spanish and German, both from and
into English. Training on only open source or synthetically generated data, we
achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) streaming results for models of comparable
size. We also introduce a metric for streaming efficiency, quantitatively
showing REINA improves the latency/quality trade-off by as much as 21% compared
to prior approaches, normalized against non-streaming baseline BLEU scores.

### [203] [Self-Error Adjustment: Theory and Practice of Balancing Individual Performance and Diversity in Ensemble Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04948)
*Rui Zou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SEA的新框架，通过分解集成误差为个体性能和多样性两部分，实现对集成性能的精细调控。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法（如Bagging和Boosting）在平衡个体学习器准确性和多样性方面缺乏精确控制，NCL虽有改进但理论界限松散且调整范围有限。

Method: SEA将集成误差分解为个体性能项和多样性项，并在损失函数中引入可调参数，实现对两者的精确控制。

Result: SEA在多个公共数据集上表现优于基线方法，且具有更灵活的调整能力和更一致的多样性变化。

Conclusion: SEA提供了更广泛的调整范围和更紧的理论界限，是一种有效的集成学习方法。

Abstract: Ensemble learning boosts performance by aggregating predictions from multiple
base learners. A core challenge is balancing individual learner accuracy with
diversity. Traditional methods like Bagging and Boosting promote diversity
through randomness but lack precise control over the accuracy-diversity
trade-off. Negative Correlation Learning (NCL) introduces a penalty to manage
this trade-off but suffers from loose theoretical bounds and limited adjustment
range. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework called
Self-Error Adjustment (SEA), which decomposes ensemble errors into two distinct
components: individual performance terms, representing the self-error of each
base learner, and diversity terms, reflecting interactions among learners. This
decomposition allows us to introduce an adjustable parameter into the loss
function, offering precise control over the contribution of each component,
thus enabling finer regulation of ensemble performance. Compared to NCL and its
variants, SEA provides a broader range of effective adjustments and more
consistent changes in diversity. Furthermore, we establish tighter theoretical
bounds for adjustable ensemble methods and validate them through empirical
experiments. Experimental results on several public regression and
classification datasets demonstrate that SEA consistently outperforms baseline
methods across all tasks. Ablation studies confirm that SEA offers more
flexible adjustment capabilities and superior performance in fine-tuning
strategies.

TL;DR: 本文提出了两种压缩去中心化算法，用于解决非凸随机优化问题，分别针对梯度有界和数据异构的场景。算法结合动量和消息压缩技术，理论证明了其有效性，并在实验中表现出优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决去中心化算法中动量和压缩通信结合的理论挑战，同时控制共识误差、压缩误差和动量梯度偏差。

Method: 设计了两种算法：1) 梯度有界场景下的压缩去中心化自适应方法；2) 数据异构场景下的压缩去中心化重球法，结合梯度跟踪技术。

Result: 两种方法均达到最优收敛速率，支持线性加速和拓扑无关参数设置，在训练深度神经网络和Transformer中表现优异。

Conclusion: 算法在理论和实验上均验证了动量和压缩通信结合的有效性，为去中心化优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: In this paper, we design two compressed decentralized algorithms for solving
nonconvex stochastic optimization under two different scenarios. Both
algorithms adopt a momentum technique to achieve fast convergence and a
message-compression technique to save communication costs. Though momentum
acceleration and compressed communication have been used in literature, it is
highly nontrivial to theoretically prove the effectiveness of their composition
in a decentralized algorithm that can maintain the benefits of both sides,
because of the need to simultaneously control the consensus error, the
compression error, and the bias from the momentum gradient.
  For the scenario where gradients are bounded, our proposal is a compressed
decentralized adaptive method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
decentralized adaptive stochastic gradient method with compressed
communication. For the scenario of data heterogeneity without bounded
gradients, our proposal is a compressed decentralized heavy-ball method, which
applies a gradient tracking technique to address the challenge of data
heterogeneity. Notably, both methods achieve an optimal convergence rate, and
they can achieve linear speed up and adopt topology-independent algorithmic
parameters within a certain regime of the user-specified error tolerance.
Superior empirical performance is observed over state-of-the-art methods on
training deep neural networks (DNNs) and Transformers.

TL;DR: MENDR是一种基于滤波器的EEG基础模型，通过Riemannian流形变换架构提升EEG信号的可解释性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前EEG基础模型缺乏透明性和可解释性，限制了临床应用的潜力。

Method: MENDR使用离散小波包变换和多分辨率系数，学习对称正定矩阵嵌入，并通过几何椭球可视化。

Result: MENDR在多个临床EEG任务中接近最先进性能，且参数更少。

Conclusion: MENDR为高效、可解释且适用于临床的EEG分析提供了新方向。

Abstract: Foundation models for electroencephalography (EEG) signals have recently
demonstrated success in learning generalized representations of EEGs,
outperforming specialized models in various downstream tasks. However, many of
these models lack transparency in their pretraining dynamics and offer limited
insight into how well EEG information is preserved within their embeddings. For
successful clinical integration, EEG foundation models must ensure transparency
in pretraining, downstream fine-tuning, and the interpretability of learned
representations. Current approaches primarily operate in the temporal domain,
overlooking advancements in digital signal processing that enable the
extraction of deterministic and traceable features, such as wavelet-based
representations. We propose MENDR (Manifold Explainable Neural Data
Representations), a filter bank-based EEG foundation model built on a novel
Riemannian Manifold Transformer architecture to resolve these issues. MENDR
learns symmetric positive definite matrix embeddings of EEG signals and is
pretrained on a large corpus comprising over 4,000 hours of EEG data,
decomposed via discrete wavelet packet transforms into multi-resolution
coefficients. MENDR significantly enhances interpretability by visualizing
symmetric positive definite embeddings as geometric ellipsoids and supports
accurate reconstruction of EEG signals from learned embeddings. Evaluations
across multiple clinical EEG tasks demonstrate that MENDR achieves near
state-of-the-art performance with substantially fewer parameters, underscoring
its potential for efficient, interpretable, and clinically applicable EEG
analysis.

multimodal policies can achieve tighter generalization bounds and more

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复杂系统的精确建模具有挑战性，传统数学模型在高维或混沌状态下可能失效。

Result: 在基准问题和实时车辆轨迹估计任务中验证了RCUKF的有效性。

Conclusion: RCUKF为复杂系统的建模与状态估计提供了一种有效的数据驱动方法。

Abstract: Accurate modeling is crucial in many engineering and scientific applications,
yet obtaining a reliable process model for complex systems is often
challenging. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework, reservoir
computing with unscented Kalman filtering (RCUKF), which integrates data-driven
modeling via reservoir computing (RC) with Bayesian estimation through the
unscented Kalman filter (UKF). The RC component learns the nonlinear system
dynamics directly from data, serving as a surrogate process model in the UKF
prediction step to generate state estimates in high-dimensional or chaotic
regimes where nominal mathematical models may fail. Meanwhile, the UKF
measurement update integrates real-time sensor data to correct potential drift
in the data-driven model. We demonstrate RCUKF effectiveness on well-known
benchmark problems and a real-time vehicle trajectory estimation task in a
high-fidelity simulation environment.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少交互模仿学习中的人类教学努力，利用新手计划中的信息（如能力和不确定性）优化学习过程。

Method: 提出ASkDAgger框架，包含S-Aware Gating（SAG）、Foresight Interactive Experience Replay（FIER）和Prioritized Interactive Experience Replay（PIER）三个组件，分别调整阈值、重放有效动作和优先重放高价值数据。

Conclusion: ASkDAgger通过综合利用新手计划信息，显著降低了人类教学负担，同时提升了学习效率和适应性。

Abstract: Human teaching effort is a significant bottleneck for the broader
applicability of interactive imitation learning. To reduce the number of
required queries, existing methods employ active learning to query the human
teacher only in uncertain, risky, or novel situations. However, during these
queries, the novice's planned actions are not utilized despite containing
valuable information, such as the novice's capabilities, as well as
corresponding uncertainty levels. To this end, we allow the novice to say: "I
plan to do this, but I am uncertain." We introduce the Active Skill-level Data
Aggregation (ASkDAgger) framework, which leverages teacher feedback on the
novice plan in three key ways: (1) S-Aware Gating (SAG): Adjusts the gating
threshold to track sensitivity, specificity, or a minimum success rate; (2)
Foresight Interactive Experience Replay (FIER), which recasts valid and
relabeled novice action plans into demonstrations; and (3) Prioritized
Interactive Experience Replay (PIER), which prioritizes replay based on
uncertainty, novice success, and demonstration age. Together, these components
balance query frequency with failure incidence, reduce the number of required
demonstration annotations, improve generalization, and speed up adaptation to
changing domains. We validate the effectiveness of ASkDAgger through
language-conditioned manipulation tasks in both simulation and real-world
environments. Code, data, and videos are available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多模态情感分析中易受虚假相关性影响，导致模型依赖统计捷径而非真实因果关系。

Method: 构建多关系图建模模态内和模态间依赖，通过注意力机制分离因果特征和捷径特征，并应用后门调整动态结合这些特征。

Result: 在多个标准数据集和OOD测试集上验证了MMCI能有效抑制偏差并提升性能。

Conclusion: MMCI通过因果干预解决了多模态情感分析中的虚假相关性问题，显著提升了模型的稳定性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) aims to understand human emotions by
integrating information from multiple modalities, such as text, audio, and
visual data. However, existing methods often suffer from spurious correlations
both within and across modalities, leading models to rely on statistical
shortcuts rather than true causal relationships, thereby undermining
generalization. To mitigate this issue, we propose a Multi-relational
Multimodal Causal Intervention (MMCI) model, which leverages the backdoor
adjustment from causal theory to address the confounding effects of such
shortcuts. Specifically, we first model the multimodal inputs as a
multi-relational graph to explicitly capture intra- and inter-modal
dependencies. Then, we apply an attention mechanism to separately estimate and
disentangle the causal features and shortcut features corresponding to these
intra- and inter-modal relations. Finally, by applying the backdoor adjustment,
we stratify the shortcut features and dynamically combine them with the causal
features to encourage MMCI to produce stable predictions under distribution
shifts. Extensive experiments on several standard MSA datasets and
out-of-distribution (OOD) test sets demonstrate that our method effectively
suppresses biases and improves performance.

Motivation: 现有LLM训练方法依赖人工标注任务和标签，限制了AI超越人类智能的发展。R-Zero旨在通过自主生成数据解决这一瓶颈。

Method: R-Zero初始化两个独立模型（Challenger和Solver），通过交互优化：Challenger提出任务，Solver解决任务，形成自我改进的课程。

Result: R-Zero显著提升LLM推理能力，例如在数学推理和通用领域推理基准上分别提升6.49和7.54分。

Conclusion: R-Zero为LLM的自主进化提供了可行路径，突破了依赖人工标注的限制。

Abstract: Self-evolving Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a scalable path toward
super-intelligence by autonomously generating, refining, and learning from
their own experiences. However, existing methods for training such models still
rely heavily on vast human-curated tasks and labels, typically via fine-tuning
or reinforcement learning, which poses a fundamental bottleneck to advancing AI
systems toward capabilities beyond human intelligence. To overcome this
limitation, we introduce R-Zero, a fully autonomous framework that generates
its own training data from scratch. Starting from a single base LLM, R-Zero
initializes two independent models with distinct roles, a Challenger and a
Solver. These models are optimized separately and co-evolve through
interaction: the Challenger is rewarded for proposing tasks near the edge of
the Solver capability, and the Solver is rewarded for solving increasingly
challenging tasks posed by the Challenger. This process yields a targeted,
self-improving curriculum without any pre-existing tasks and labels.
Empirically, R-Zero substantially improves reasoning capability across
different backbone LLMs, e.g., boosting the Qwen3-4B-Base by +6.49 on
math-reasoning benchmarks and +7.54 on general-domain reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: TrajEvo为自动化设计高效、可解释且泛化能力强的轨迹预测启发式方法提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is a critical task in modeling human behavior,
especially in safety-critical domains such as social robotics and autonomous
vehicle navigation. Traditional heuristics based on handcrafted rules often
lack accuracy and generalizability. Although deep learning approaches offer
improved performance, they typically suffer from high computational cost,
limited explainability, and, importantly, poor generalization to
out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. In this paper, we introduce TrajEvo, a
framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically design
trajectory prediction heuristics. TrajEvo employs an evolutionary algorithm to
generate and refine prediction heuristics from past trajectory data. We propose
two key innovations: Cross-Generation Elite Sampling to encourage population
diversity, and a Statistics Feedback Loop that enables the LLM to analyze and
improve alternative predictions. Our evaluations demonstrate that TrajEvo
outperforms existing heuristic methods across multiple real-world datasets, and
notably surpasses both heuristic and deep learning methods in generalizing to
an unseen OOD real-world dataset. TrajEvo marks a promising step toward the
automated design of fast, explainable, and generalizable trajectory prediction
heuristics. We release our source code to facilitate future research at

Result: 实验表明，SPaRFT在多个推理基准测试中表现优异，样本需求减少100倍。

Conclusion: 精心设计的训练课程能高效解锁大语言模型的推理能力，减少资源消耗。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning capabilities when
fine-tuned with reinforcement learning (RL). However, such methods require
extensive data and compute, making them impractical for smaller models. Current
approaches to curriculum learning or data selection are largely
heuristic-driven or demand extensive computational resources, limiting their
scalability and generalizability. We propose \textbf{SPaRFT}, a self-paced
learning framework that enables efficient learning based on the capability of
the model being trained through optimizing which data to use and when. First,
we apply \emph{cluster-based data reduction} to partition training data by
semantics and difficulty, extracting a compact yet diverse subset that reduces
redundancy. Then, a \emph{multi-armed bandit} treats data clusters as arms,
optimized to allocate training samples based on model current performance.
Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks show that SPaRFT achieves
comparable or better accuracy than state-of-the-art baselines while using up to
\(100\times\) fewer samples. Ablation studies and analyses further highlight
the importance of both data clustering and adaptive selection. Our results
demonstrate that carefully curated, performance-driven training curricula can
unlock strong reasoning abilities in LLMs with minimal resources.

Conclusion: 眼动追踪可用于AR中的SA建模，有助于设计兼顾安全与SA的AR系统。

Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) systems, while enhancing task performance through
real-time guidance, pose risks of inducing cognitive tunneling-a hyperfocus on
virtual content that compromises situational awareness (SA) in safety-critical
scenarios. This paper investigates SA in AR-guided cardiopulmonary
resuscitation (CPR), where responders must balance effective compressions with
vigilance to unpredictable hazards (e.g., patient vomiting). We developed an AR
app on a Magic Leap 2 that overlays real-time CPR feedback (compression depth
and rate) and conducted a user study with simulated unexpected incidents (e.g.,
bleeding) to evaluate SA, in which SA metrics were collected via observation
and questionnaires administered during freeze-probe events. Eye tracking
analysis revealed that higher SA levels were associated with greater saccadic
amplitude and velocity, and with reduced proportion and frequency of fixations
on virtual content. To predict SA, we propose FixGraphPool, a graph neural
network that structures gaze events (fixations, saccades) into spatiotemporal
graphs, effectively capturing dynamic attentional patterns. Our model achieved
83.0% accuracy (F1=81.0%), outperforming feature-based machine learning and
state-of-the-art time-series models by leveraging domain knowledge and
spatial-temporal information encoded in ET data. These findings demonstrate the
potential of eye tracking for SA modeling in AR and highlight its utility in
designing AR systems that ensure user safety and situational awareness.

Result: KNOW预测在多种数据集和架构上优于传统微调和简单权重预测。

Conclusion: 通过重新解释遗忘动态，为深度学习中的知识转移提供了新视角。

Abstract: Pre-trained weights have become a cornerstone of modern deep learning,
enabling efficient knowledge transfer and improving downstream task
performance, especially in data-scarce scenarios. However, a fundamental
question remains: how can we obtain better pre-trained weights that encapsulate
more knowledge beyond the given dataset? In this work, we introduce
\textbf{KNowledge Overflowed Weights (KNOW)} prediction, a novel strategy that
leverages structured forgetting and its inversion to synthesize
knowledge-enriched weights. Our key insight is that sequential fine-tuning on
progressively downsized datasets induces a structured forgetting process, which
can be modeled and reversed to recover knowledge as if trained on a larger
dataset. We construct a dataset of weight transitions governed by this
controlled forgetting and employ meta-learning to model weight prediction
effectively. Specifically, our \textbf{KNowledge Overflowed Weights Nowcaster
(KNOWN)} acts as a hyper-model that learns the general evolution of weights and
predicts enhanced weights with improved generalization. Extensive experiments
across diverse datasets and architectures demonstrate that KNOW prediction
consistently outperforms Na\"ive fine-tuning and simple weight prediction,
leading to superior downstream performance. Our work provides a new perspective
on reinterpreting forgetting dynamics to push the limits of knowledge transfer
in deep learning.

*Moshe Eliasof,Eldad Haber,Carola-Bibiane Schönlieb*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TANGO是一个基于动态系统的图表示学习框架，通过学习的能量景观及其下降动态来指导节点特征的演化，结合能量梯度下降和切向演化，提升了图神经网络的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图学习中常见的能量平坦或病态区域问题，同时缓解过压缩现象，提升图神经网络的信号传播能力。

Method: 提出可学习的Lyapunov函数定义能量减少方向，结合消息传递学习的切向分量，分解为能量梯度下降和切向演化的正交流。

Result: 在多个节点和图分类、回归基准测试中表现优异，验证了能量函数与切向流联合学习的有效性。

Conclusion: TANGO通过能量景观和切向演化的结合，为图神经网络提供了一种灵活且稳定的动态表示学习方法。

Abstract: We introduce TANGO -- a dynamical systems inspired framework for graph
representation learning that governs node feature evolution through a learned
energy landscape and its associated descent dynamics. At the core of our
approach is a learnable Lyapunov function over node embeddings, whose gradient
defines an energy-reducing direction that guarantees convergence and stability.
To enhance flexibility while preserving the benefits of energy-based dynamics,
we incorporate a novel tangential component, learned via message passing, that
evolves features while maintaining the energy value. This decomposition into
orthogonal flows of energy gradient descent and tangential evolution yields a
flexible form of graph dynamics, and enables effective signal propagation even
in flat or ill-conditioned energy regions, that often appear in graph learning.
Our method mitigates oversquashing and is compatible with different graph
neural network backbones. Empirically, TANGO achieves strong performance across
a diverse set of node and graph classification and regression benchmarks,
demonstrating the effectiveness of jointly learned energy functions and
tangential flows for graph neural networks.

*Simin Huo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新型非单调分段激活函数ULU及其自适应变体AULU，在图像分类和目标检测任务中表现优于ReLU和Mish，并引入了LIB指标量化模型的归纳偏置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的激活函数（如ReLU和Mish）在处理正负输入时表现有限，需要一种更灵活且高效的激活函数来提升模型性能。

Method: 提出ULU和AULU两种分段激活函数，分别通过固定参数和可学习参数处理正负输入，并引入LIB指标量化模型的归纳偏置。

Result: 实验表明ULU和AULU在图像分类和目标检测任务中显著优于ReLU和Mish。

Conclusion: ULU和AULU为激活函数设计提供了新的思路，LIB指标为模型分析提供了量化工具。

Abstract: We propose \textbf{ULU}, a novel non-monotonic, piecewise activation function
defined as $\{f(x;\alpha_1),x<0; f(x;\alpha_2),x>=0 \}$, where
$f(x;\alpha)=0.5x(tanh(\alpha x)+1),\alpha >0$. ULU treats positive and
negative inputs differently. Extensive experiments demonstrate ULU
significantly outperforms ReLU and Mish across image classification and object
detection tasks. Its variant Adaptive ULU (\textbf{AULU}) is expressed as
$\{f(x;\beta_1^2),x<0; f(x;\beta_2^2),x>=0 \}$, where $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$
are learnable parameters, enabling it to adapt its response separately for
positive and negative inputs. Additionally, we introduce the LIB (Like
Inductive Bias) metric from AULU to quantitatively measure the inductive bias
of the model.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Integrated Influence的新数据归因方法，通过引入基线数据集和退化过程，解决了现有方法（如LOO）的局部性和缺乏基线的问题，提供了更可靠的数据归因。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据归因方法（如LOO）仅关注单个训练样本的影响，忽视了训练集的集体影响，且缺乏基线，限制了解释的灵活性。

Method: 提出Integrated Influence方法，定义基线数据集，通过数据退化过程从当前数据集过渡到基线，并累积每个样本在此过程中的影响。

Result: 实验表明，Integrated Influence在数据归因和错误标签识别任务中比现有方法更可靠。

Conclusion: Integrated Influence通过引入基线和退化过程，提供了更全面和灵活的数据归因方法，且理论框架支持现有方法为其特例。

Abstract: As an effective approach to quantify how training samples influence test
sample, data attribution is crucial for understanding data and model and
further enhance the transparency of machine learning models. We find that
prevailing data attribution methods based on leave-one-out (LOO) strategy
suffer from the local-based explanation, as these LOO-based methods only
perturb a single training sample, and overlook the collective influence in the
training set. On the other hand, the lack of baseline in many data attribution
methods reduces the flexibility of the explanation, e.g., failing to provide
counterfactual explanations. In this paper, we propose Integrated Influence, a
novel data attribution method that incorporates a baseline approach. Our method
defines a baseline dataset, follows a data degeneration process to transition
the current dataset to the baseline, and accumulates the influence of each
sample throughout this process. We provide a solid theoretical framework for
our method, and further demonstrate that popular methods, such as influence
functions, can be viewed as special cases of our approach. Experimental results
show that Integrated Influence generates more reliable data attributions
compared to existing methods in both data attribution task and mislablled
example identification task.

TL;DR: 提出了一种解决冷启动问题的主动偏好学习框架，通过自监督预训练和主动学习循环提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冷启动问题在计算社会系统和经济分析中尤为突出，缺乏初始标记数据导致性能下降。

Method: 结合PCA自监督预训练生成伪标签，再通过主动学习循环优化模型。

Result: 在多个领域数据集上表现优于传统方法，以更少标记数据实现更高准确率。

Conclusion: 该框架有效缓解冷启动问题，提升了偏好学习在数据受限环境中的适用性。

Abstract: Active preference learning is a powerful paradigm for efficiently modeling
preferences, yet it suffers from the cold-start problem: a significant drop in
performance when no initial labeled data is available. This challenge is
particularly acute in computational social systems and economic analysis, where
labeled data is often scarce, expensive, and subject to expert noise. To
address this gap, we propose a novel framework for cold-start active preference
learning. Our method initiates the learning process through a self-supervised
pre-training phase, utilizing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to derive
initial pseudo-labels from the data's inherent structure, thereby creating a
cold-start model without any initial oracle interaction. Subsequently, the
model is refined through an active learning loop that strategically queries a
simulated noisy oracle for labels. We conduct extensive experiments on diverse
datasets from different domains, including financial credibility, career
success rate, and socio-economic status. The results demonstrate that our
cold-start approach outperforms standard active learning strategies that begin
from a blank slate, achieving higher accuracy with substantially fewer labeled
pairs. Our framework offers a practical and effective solution to mitigate the
cold-start problem, enhancing the sample efficiency and applicability of
preference learning in data-constrained environments. We release our code at

TL;DR: 提出一种新的弱监督学习框架，通过整合多种弱监督信号（相似性-置信度和置信度-差异）来提升模型性能，特别是在标注数据有限的情况下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在机器学习应用中，标注数据通常不准确或不足，现有弱监督学习方法多依赖单一弱监督信号，限制了性能提升。

Method: 提出SconfConfDiff分类方法，整合两种弱标签形式，并设计两种无偏风险估计器（基于凸组合和新建模交互）。

Result: 实验证明该方法在多种设置下优于现有基线，理论分析表明其具有最优收敛率和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该框架通过多视角弱监督信号和风险校正，显著提升了弱监督学习的性能。

Abstract: In practical machine learning applications, it is often challenging to assign
accurate labels to data, and increasing the number of labeled instances is
often limited. In such cases, Weakly Supervised Learning (WSL), which enables
training with incomplete or imprecise supervision, provides a practical and
effective solution. However, most existing WSL methods focus on leveraging a
single type of weak supervision. In this paper, we propose a novel WSL
framework that leverages complementary weak supervision signals from multiple
relational perspectives, which can be especially valuable when labeled data is
limited. Specifically, we introduce SconfConfDiff Classification, a method that
integrates two distinct forms of weaklabels: similarity-confidence and
confidence-difference, which are assigned to unlabeled data pairs. To implement
this method, we derive two types of unbiased risk estimators for
classification: one based on a convex combination of existing estimators, and
another newly designed by modeling the interaction between two weak labels. We
prove that both estimators achieve optimal convergence rates with respect to
estimation error bounds. Furthermore, we introduce a risk correction approach
to mitigate overfitting caused by negative empirical risk, and provide
theoretical analysis on the robustness of the proposed method against
inaccurate class prior probability and label noise. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing
baselines across a variety of settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型在函数调用任务中缺乏稳健的推理策略，监督微调依赖表面模式匹配，而标准强化学习方法难以处理结构化函数调用的复杂动作空间。

Method: 采用两阶段数据准备流程，结合迭代LLM评估和抽象语法树验证，提出基于战略熵探索的强化学习框架，优化函数调用任务的推理策略。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了函数调用任务的性能，尤其在代码预训练模型上表现突出，表明结构化语言生成能力为强化学习提供了优势起点。

Abstract: Function calling capabilities are crucial for deploying Large Language Models
in real-world applications, yet current training approaches fail to develop
robust reasoning strategies. Supervised fine-tuning produces models that rely
on superficial pattern matching, while standard reinforcement learning methods
struggle with the complex action space of structured function calls. We present
a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance group relative
policy optimization through strategic entropy based exploration specifically
tailored for function calling tasks. Our approach addresses three critical
challenges in function calling: insufficient exploration during policy
learning, lack of structured reasoning in chain-of-thought generation, and
inadequate verification of parameter extraction. Our two-stage data preparation
pipeline ensures high-quality training samples through iterative LLM evaluation
and abstract syntax tree validation. Extensive experiments on the Berkeley
Function Calling Leaderboard demonstrate that this framework achieves
state-of-the-art performance among open-source models with 86.02\% overall
accuracy, outperforming standard GRPO by up to 6\% on complex multi-function
scenarios. Notably, our method shows particularly strong improvements on
code-pretrained models, suggesting that structured language generation
capabilities provide an advantageous starting point for reinforcement learning
in function calling tasks. We will release all the code, models and dataset to
benefit the community.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为HFedATM的分层联邦领域泛化方法，通过卷积滤波器对齐和正则化聚合解决域偏移问题，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分层联邦学习（HFL）存在域偏移问题，影响模型在未见目标域上的性能，而现有的联邦领域泛化方法（FedDG）尚未充分融入HFL框架。

Method: 提出HFedATM方法，包括滤波器最优传输对齐和收缩感知正则化均值聚合，以解决域偏移问题。

Result: 实验表明HFedATM显著提升了FedDG基线的性能，同时保持了计算和通信效率，理论分析显示其收敛更快且训练更稳定。

Conclusion: HFedATM为分层联邦学习中的域偏移问题提供了有效解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized approach where multiple clients
collaboratively train a shared global model without sharing their raw data.
Despite its effectiveness, conventional FL faces scalability challenges due to
excessive computational and communication demands placed on a single central
server as the number of participating devices grows. Hierarchical Federated
Learning (HFL) addresses these issues by distributing model aggregation tasks
across intermediate nodes (stations), thereby enhancing system scalability and
robustness against single points of failure. However, HFL still suffers from a
critical yet often overlooked limitation: domain shift, where data
distributions vary significantly across different clients and stations,
reducing model performance on unseen target domains. While Federated Domain
Generalization (FedDG) methods have emerged to improve robustness to domain
shifts, their integration into HFL frameworks remains largely unexplored. In
this paper, we formally introduce Hierarchical Federated Domain Generalization
(HFedDG), a novel scenario designed to investigate domain shift within
hierarchical architectures. Specifically, we propose HFedATM, a hierarchical
aggregation method that first aligns the convolutional filters of models from
different stations through Filter-wise Optimal Transport Alignment and
subsequently merges aligned models using a Shrinkage-aware Regularized Mean
Aggregation. Our extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that HFedATM
significantly boosts the performance of existing FedDG baselines across
multiple datasets and maintains computational and communication efficiency.
Moreover, theoretical analyses indicate that HFedATM achieves tighter
generalization error bounds compared to standard hierarchical averaging,
resulting in faster convergence and stable training behavior.

Method: 分析深度全连接神经网络在Sobolev空间中的逼近能力，使用常用激活函数，并与传统数值方法（如有限元和谱方法）对比。

Result: 神经网络在逼近PDE弱解时表现出超收敛现象，误差率优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 该研究为神经网络在科学计算中的应用提供了统一的理论基础，展示了其在PDE求解中的潜力。

Abstract: This paper establishes a comprehensive approximation result for deep
fully-connected neural networks with commonly-used and general activation
functions in Sobolev spaces $W^{n,\infty}$, with errors measured in the
$W^{m,p}$-norm for $m < n$ and $1\le p \le \infty$. The derived rates surpass
those of classical numerical approximation techniques, such as finite element
and spectral methods, exhibiting a phenomenon we refer to as
\emph{super-convergence}. Our analysis shows that deep networks with general
activations can approximate weak solutions of partial differential equations
(PDEs) with superior accuracy compared to traditional numerical methods at the
approximation level. Furthermore, this work closes a significant gap in the
error-estimation theory for neural-network-based approaches to PDEs, offering a
unified theoretical foundation for their use in scientific computing.

Motivation: 现有AutoML系统在集成阶段采用固定策略，无法适应任务特性，PSEO旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过二元二次编程选择基础模型，引入多层堆叠机制，并构建超参数空间搜索最优集成策略。

Result: 在80个公开数据集上，PSEO平均测试排名2.96，优于16种现有方法。

Conclusion: PSEO通过优化后堆叠集成策略显著提升AutoML性能，适应任务特性。

Abstract: The Combined Algorithm Selection and Hyperparameter Optimization (CASH)
problem is fundamental in Automated Machine Learning (AutoML). Inspired by the
success of ensemble learning, recent AutoML systems construct post-hoc
ensembles for final predictions rather than relying on the best single model.
However, while most CASH methods conduct extensive searches for the optimal
single model, they typically employ fixed strategies during the ensemble phase
that fail to adapt to specific task characteristics. To tackle this issue, we
propose PSEO, a framework for post-hoc stacking ensemble optimization. First,
we conduct base model selection through binary quadratic programming, with a
trade-off between diversity and performance. Furthermore, we introduce two
mechanisms to fully realize the potential of multi-layer stacking. Finally,
PSEO builds a hyperparameter space and searches for the optimal post-hoc
ensemble strategy within it. Empirical results on 80 public datasets show that
\sys achieves the best average test rank (2.96) among 16 methods, including
post-hoc designs in recent AutoML systems and state-of-the-art ensemble
learning methods.

Motivation: 由于基于强化学习的代理模型（ABMs和RABMs）的复杂性和随机性，以及缺乏标准化的评估指标，其性能评估具有挑战性。

Method: 研究开发了领域驱动的强化学习评估指标，并结合传统和前沿指标，通过疫情模拟案例（如口罩使用、疫苗接种和封锁）验证其效果。

Result: 结果表明，领域驱动的奖励与传统及前沿指标结合，在不同模拟场景（如口罩供应差异）中表现良好。

Conclusion: 领域驱动的强化学习评估指标为复杂代理模型的性能评估提供了有效工具。

Abstract: For the development and optimization of agent-based models (ABMs) and
rational agent-based models (RABMs), optimization algorithms such as
reinforcement learning are extensively used. However, assessing the performance
of RL-based ABMs and RABMS models is challenging due to the complexity and
stochasticity of the modeled systems, and the lack of well-standardized metrics
for comparing RL algorithms. In this study, we are developing domain-driven
metrics for RL, while building on state-of-the-art metrics. We demonstrate our
``Domain-driven-RL-metrics'' using policy optimization on a rational ABM
disease modeling case study to model masking behavior, vaccination, and
lockdown in a pandemic. Our results show the use of domain-driven rewards in
conjunction with traditional and state-of-the-art metrics for a few different
simulation scenarios such as the differential availability of masks.

Motivation: 现有个性化联邦学习方法假设客户端静态参与，而现实中新客户端可能动态加入，这带来了性能保持和知识转移的挑战。

Method: 提出pFedDSH框架，基于中央超网络生成个性化模型，使用批次特定掩码保护知识，并引入数据重放策略促进反向知识转移。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和Tiny-ImageNet上的实验表明，pFedDSH优于现有方法，实现了对现有客户端的性能稳定和新客户端的适应。

Conclusion: pFedDSH在动态客户端加入场景中表现优异，兼顾了性能稳定性和资源效率。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed clients without sharing raw data, offering a significant privacy
benefit. However, most existing Personalized Federated Learning (pFL) methods
assume a static client participation, which does not reflect real-world
scenarios where new clients may continuously join the federated system (i.e.,
dynamic client onboarding). In this paper, we explore a practical scenario in
which a new batch of clients is introduced incrementally while the learning
task remains unchanged. This dynamic environment poses various challenges,
including preserving performance for existing clients without retraining and
enabling efficient knowledge transfer between client batches. To address these
issues, we propose Personalized Federated Data-Free Sub-Hypernetwork (pFedDSH),
a novel framework based on a central hypernetwork that generates personalized
models for each client via embedding vectors. To maintain knowledge stability
for existing clients, pFedDSH incorporates batch-specific masks, which activate
subsets of neurons to preserve knowledge. Furthermore, we introduce a data-free
replay strategy motivated by DeepInversion to facilitate backward transfer,
enhancing existing clients' performance without compromising privacy. Extensive
experiments conducted on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate
that pFedDSH outperforms the state-of-the-art pFL and Federated Continual
Learning baselines in our investigation scenario. Our approach achieves robust
performance stability for existing clients, as well as adaptation for new
clients and efficient utilization of neural resources.

Motivation: 当前基于EEG的AAD方法缺乏协同框架，无法充分利用互补的EEG特征，且受限于能效约束。

Method: 提出S$^2$M-Former，采用尖峰驱动的对称架构和轻量级1D令牌序列，减少参数和能耗。

Result: 在三个AAD基准测试中表现优异，能耗降低5.8倍，参数减少14.7倍，性能超越现有方法。

Conclusion: S$^2$M-Former是一种高效、低功耗的AAD解决方案，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Auditory attention detection (AAD) aims to decode listeners' focus in complex
auditory environments from electroencephalography (EEG) recordings, which is
crucial for developing neuro-steered hearing devices. Despite recent
advancements, EEG-based AAD remains hindered by the absence of synergistic
frameworks that can fully leverage complementary EEG features under
energy-efficiency constraints. We propose S$^2$M-Former, a novel spiking
symmetric mixing framework to address this limitation through two key
innovations: i) Presenting a spike-driven symmetric architecture composed of
parallel spatial and frequency branches with mirrored modular design,
leveraging biologically plausible token-channel mixers to enhance complementary
learning across branches; ii) Introducing lightweight 1D token sequences to
replace conventional 3D operations, reducing parameters by 14.7$\times$. The
brain-inspired spiking architecture further reduces power consumption,
achieving a 5.8$\times$ energy reduction compared to recent ANN methods, while
also surpassing existing SNN baselines in terms of parameter efficiency and
performance. Comprehensive experiments on three AAD benchmarks (KUL, DTU and
AV-GC-AAD) across three settings (within-trial, cross-trial and cross-subject)
demonstrate that S$^2$M-Former achieves comparable state-of-the-art (SOTA)
decoding accuracy, making it a promising low-power, high-performance solution
for AAD tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在推理时通常忽略对齐质量与计算成本之间的平衡，HIA旨在解决这一问题。

Method: HIA使用轻量级提示优化器、启发式奖励模型和两阶段过滤，减少推理调用。

Result: 在真实数据集上，HIA在相同推理预算下优于其他基线方法，且在低推理预算下仍有效。

Conclusion: HIA为可扩展、个性化的LLM部署提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Aligning LLMs with user preferences is crucial for real-world use but often
requires costly fine-tuning or expensive inference, forcing trade-offs between
alignment quality and computational cost. Existing inference-time methods
typically ignore this balance, focusing solely on the optimized policy's
performance. We propose HIA (Heuristic-Guided Inference-time Alignment), a
tuning-free, black-box-compatible approach that uses a lightweight prompt
optimizer, heuristic reward models, and two-stage filtering to reduce inference
calls while preserving alignment quality. On real-world prompt datasets,
HelpSteer and ComPRed, HIA outperforms best-of-N sampling, beam search, and
greedy search baselines in multi-objective, goal-conditioned tasks under the
same inference budget. We also find that HIA is effective under low-inference
budgets with as little as one or two response queries, offering a practical
solution for scalable, personalized LLM deployment.

Abstract: Consider a collection of competing machine learning algorithms. Given their
performance on a benchmark of datasets, we would like to identify the best
performing algorithm. Specifically, which algorithm is most likely to rank
highest on a future, unseen dataset. A natural approach is to select the
algorithm that demonstrates the best performance on the benchmark. However, in
many cases the performance differences are marginal and additional candidates
may also be considered. This problem is formulated as subset selection for
multinomial distributions. Formally, given a sample from a countable alphabet,
our goal is to identify a minimal subset of symbols that includes the most
frequent symbol in the population with high confidence. In this work, we
introduce a novel framework for the subset selection problem. We provide both
asymptotic and finite-sample schemes that significantly improve upon currently
known methods. In addition, we provide matching lower bounds, demonstrating the
favorable performance of our proposed schemes.

Abstract: We developed a ResNet-based human activity recognition (HAR) model with
minimal overhead to detect gait versus non-gait activities and everyday
activities (walking, running, stairs, standing, sitting, lying, sit-to-stand
transitions). The model was trained and evaluated using smartphone sensor data

TL;DR: 论文提出PITI-DeepONet，一种双输出架构，通过物理信息或混合目标训练，显著提升时间依赖PDE的长期预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法（FR和AR）在长期预测时存在误差累积和泛化能力差的问题，无法满足科学机器学习的需求。

Method: PITI-DeepONet通过学习时间导数算子并结合经典时间步进方案，避免直接预测未来状态，同时利用残差监测评估预测质量。

Result: 在多个基准问题中，PITI-DeepONet显著降低了相对误差（如热方程误差减少84% vs FR）。

Conclusion: PITI-DeepONet为复杂时间依赖PDE的长期可靠积分提供了新途径。

Abstract: Accurately modeling and inferring solutions to time-dependent partial
differential equations (PDEs) over extended horizons remains a core challenge
in scientific machine learning. Traditional full rollout (FR) methods, which
predict entire trajectories in one pass, often fail to capture the causal
dependencies and generalize poorly outside the training time horizon.
Autoregressive (AR) approaches, evolving the system step by step, suffer from
error accumulation, limiting long-term accuracy. These shortcomings limit the
long-term accuracy and reliability of both strategies. To address these issues,
we introduce the Physics-Informed Time-Integrated Deep Operator Network
(PITI-DeepONet), a dual-output architecture trained via fully physics-informed
or hybrid physics- and data-driven objectives to ensure stable, accurate
long-term evolution well beyond the training horizon. Instead of forecasting
future states, the network learns the time-derivative operator from the current
state, integrating it using classical time-stepping schemes to advance the
solution in time. Additionally, the framework can leverage residual monitoring
during inference to estimate prediction quality and detect when the system
transitions outside the training domain. Applied to benchmark problems,
PITI-DeepONet shows improved accuracy over extended inference time horizons
when compared to traditional methods. Mean relative $\mathcal{L}_2$ errors
reduced by 84% (vs. FR) and 79% (vs. AR) for the one-dimensional heat equation;
by 87% (vs. FR) and 98% (vs. AR) for the one-dimensional Burgers equation; and
by 42% (vs. FR) and 89% (vs. AR) for the two-dimensional Allen-Cahn equation.
By moving beyond classic FR and AR schemes, PITI-DeepONet paves the way for
more reliable, long-term integration of complex, time-dependent PDEs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融领域对LLMs的准确性要求极高，现有幻觉基准难以满足其需求，因此需要开发专门的评估方法。

Method: 采用上下文感知的掩码跨度预测任务，基于真实金融文档构建数据集，并评估LLMs的表现。

Result: 提出了一个自动化数据集创建范式，生成了基于S&P 500年报的新评估数据集，并揭示了LLMs在金融表格数据中的幻觉模式。

Conclusion: 该研究为金融领域LLMs的评估提供了可靠方法，有助于构建更可信的生成式AI系统。

Abstract: Hallucination remains a critical challenge for deploying Large Language
Models (LLMs) in finance. Accurate extraction and precise calculation from
tabular data are essential for reliable financial analysis, since even minor
numerical errors can undermine decision-making and regulatory compliance.
Financial applications have unique requirements, often relying on
context-dependent, numerical, and proprietary tabular data that existing
hallucination benchmarks rarely capture. In this study, we develop a rigorous
and scalable framework for evaluating intrinsic hallucinations in financial
LLMs, conceptualized as a context-aware masked span prediction task over
real-world financial documents. Our main contributions are: (1) a novel,
automated dataset creation paradigm using a masking strategy; (2) a new
hallucination evaluation dataset derived from S&P 500 annual reports; and (3) a
comprehensive evaluation of intrinsic hallucination patterns in
state-of-the-art LLMs on financial tabular data. Our work provides a robust
methodology for in-house LLM evaluation and serves as a critical step toward
building more trustworthy and reliable financial Generative AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线广告系统的检索阶段无法实时获取精确出价，导致与排名阶段不一致，影响平台收入和广告效果。

Method: BAR框架通过Bidding-Aware Modeling（单调性约束学习和多任务蒸馏）和Asynchronous Near-Line Inference实现实时更新，Task-Attentive Refinement模块增强特征交互。

Result: 离线实验和阿里巴巴平台部署显示，BAR带来4.32%的平台收入增长和22.2%的正向广告曝光提升。

Conclusion: BAR有效解决了多阶段不一致问题，显著提升了广告系统的性能和经济效益。

Abstract: Online advertising systems typically use a cascaded architecture to manage
massive requests and candidate volumes, where the ranking stages allocate
traffic based on eCPM (predicted CTR $\times$ Bid). With the increasing
popularity of auto-bidding strategies, the inconsistency between the
computationally sensitive retrieval stage and the ranking stages becomes more
pronounced, as the former cannot access precise, real-time bids for the vast ad
corpus. This discrepancy leads to sub-optimal platform revenue and advertiser
outcomes. To tackle this problem, we propose Bidding-Aware Retrieval (BAR), a
model-based retrieval framework that addresses multi-stage inconsistency by
incorporating ad bid value into the retrieval scoring function. The core
innovation is Bidding-Aware Modeling, incorporating bid signals through
monotonicity-constrained learning and multi-task distillation to ensure
economically coherent representations, while Asynchronous Near-Line Inference
enables real-time updates to the embedding for market responsiveness.
Furthermore, the Task-Attentive Refinement module selectively enhances feature
interactions to disentangle user interest and commercial value signals.
Extensive offline experiments and full-scale deployment across Alibaba's
display advertising platform validated BAR's efficacy: 4.32% platform revenue
increase with 22.2% impression lift for positively-operated advertisements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ROP预测对钻井优化至关重要，但传统方法难以捕捉复杂的时间动态和上下文关系，导致预测效果不佳。

Method: 采用混合深度学习架构，整合LSTM、Transformer、TS-Mixer和注意力机制，建模时间依赖性和特征交互。

Result: 在真实钻井数据集上表现优异，R-squared为0.9988，MAPE为1.447%，优于基准模型。

Conclusion: 该混合方法为实时ROP预测提供了可靠解决方案，具有显著的工程应用价值。

Abstract: The Rate of Penetration (ROP) is crucial for optimizing drilling operations;
however, accurately predicting it is hindered by the complex, dynamic, and
high-dimensional nature of drilling data. Traditional empirical, physics-based,
and basic machine learning models often fail to capture intricate temporal and
contextual relationships, resulting in suboptimal predictions and limited
real-time utility. To address this gap, we propose a novel hybrid deep learning
architecture integrating Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Transformer
encoders, Time-Series Mixer (TS-Mixer) blocks, and attention mechanisms to
synergistically model temporal dependencies, static feature interactions,
global context, and dynamic feature importance. Evaluated on a real-world
drilling dataset, our model outperformed benchmarks (standalone LSTM, TS-Mixer,
and simpler hybrids) with an R-squared score of 0.9988 and a Mean Absolute
Percentage Error of 1.447%, as measured by standard regression metrics
(R-squared, MAE, RMSE, MAPE). Model interpretability was ensured using SHAP and
LIME, while actual vs. predicted curves and bias checks confirmed accuracy and
fairness across scenarios. This advanced hybrid approach enables reliable
real-time ROP prediction, paving the way for intelligent, cost-effective
drilling optimization systems with significant operational impact.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的倾向得分加权方法DFW，通过去混淆因子构建稳定的样本权重，优于现有方法如IPW和CBPS。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 观测数据中的选择偏差导致协变量分布不平衡，传统倾向得分加权方法（如IPW）因权重不稳定而效果受限。

Method: DFW利用去混淆因子构建稳定权重，优先选择低混淆样本，生成更接近随机对照试验的伪群体。

Result: 实验表明DFW在协变量平衡和因果效应估计上优于IPW和CBPS。

Conclusion: DFW通过稳定权重和降低方差，有效解决了传统倾向得分加权方法的局限性。

Abstract: Estimating causal effects from observational data is challenging due to
selection bias, which leads to imbalanced covariate distributions across
treatment groups. Propensity score-based weighting methods are widely used to
address this issue by reweighting samples to simulate a randomized controlled
trial (RCT). However, the effectiveness of these methods heavily depends on the
observed data and the accuracy of the propensity score estimator. For example,
inverse propensity weighting (IPW) assigns weights based on the inverse of the
propensity score, which can lead to instable weights when propensity scores
have high variance-either due to data or model misspecification-ultimately
degrading the ability of handling selection bias and treatment effect
estimation. To overcome these limitations, we propose Deconfounding Factor
Weighting (DFW), a novel propensity score-based approach that leverages the
deconfounding factor-to construct stable and effective sample weights. DFW
prioritizes less confounded samples while mitigating the influence of highly
confounded ones, producing a pseudopopulation that better approximates a RCT.
Our approach ensures bounded weights, lower variance, and improved covariate
balance.While DFW is formulated for binary treatments, it naturally extends to
multi-treatment settings, as the deconfounding factor is computed based on the
estimated probability of the treatment actually received by each sample.
Through extensive experiments on real-world benchmark and synthetic datasets,
we demonstrate that DFW outperforms existing methods, including IPW and CBPS,
in both covariate balancing and treatment effect estimation.

Motivation: 传统集中式联邦学习存在单点故障、个性化不足和对数据分布变化的鲁棒性差等问题，需要更灵活的去中心化解决方案。

Method: 采用P2P拓扑结构，利用本地验证集计算一致性分数，选择可信且有益的更新，并通过正则化稳定训练。

Result: 在对抗性和异构条件下，LIGHTYEAR在客户端性能上优于集中式基准和现有P2P方法。

Conclusion: LIGHTYEAR框架通过去中心化和个性化更新选择，有效提升了联邦学习的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed clients while preserving data privacy by keeping data local.
Traditional FL approaches rely on a centralized, star-shaped topology, where a
central server aggregates model updates from clients. However, this
architecture introduces several limitations, including a single point of
failure, limited personalization, and poor robustness to distribution shifts or
vulnerability to malfunctioning clients. Moreover, update selection in
centralized FL often relies on low-level parameter differences, which can be
unreliable when client data is not independent and identically distributed, and
offer clients little control. In this work, we propose a decentralized,
peer-to-peer (P2P) FL framework. It leverages the flexibility of the P2P
topology to enable each client to identify and aggregate a personalized set of
trustworthy and beneficial updates.This framework is the Local Inference Guided
Aggregation for Heterogeneous Training Environments to Yield Enhancement
Through Agreement and Regularization (LIGHTYEAR). Central to our method is an
agreement score, computed on a local validation set, which quantifies the
semantic alignment of incoming updates in the function space with respect to
the clients reference model. Each client uses this score to select a tailored
subset of updates and performs aggregation with a regularization term that
further stabilizes the training. Our empirical evaluation across two datasets
shows that the proposed approach consistently outperforms both centralized
baselines and existing P2P methods in terms of client-level performance,
particularly under adversarial and heterogeneous conditions.

Motivation: 传统参数高效微调方法（如LoRA）与基础模型架构紧密耦合，限制了其在异构预训练大语言模型中的适用性。

Method: Cross-LoRA包含两个关键组件：LoRA-Align（通过SVD和Frobenius最优线性变换对齐子空间）和LoRA-Shift（将源LoRA权重更新投影到目标模型参数空间）。

Result: 在ARCs、OBOA和HellaSwag等实验中，Cross-LoRA相对基础模型提升了5.26%的性能。

Conclusion: Cross-LoRA无需数据和训练，能在20分钟内完成轻量级适配，性能与直接训练的LoRA适配器相当。

Abstract: Traditional parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods such as LoRA are
tightly coupled with the base model architecture, which constrains their
applicability across heterogeneous pretrained large language models (LLMs). To
address this limitation, we introduce Cross-LoRA, a data-free framework for
transferring LoRA modules between diverse base models without requiring
additional training data. Cross-LoRA consists of two key components: (a)
LoRA-Align, which performs subspace alignment between source and target base
models through rank-truncated singular value decomposition (SVD) and
Frobenius-optimal linear transformation, ensuring compatibility under dimension
mismatch; and (b) LoRA-Shift, which applies the aligned subspaces to project
source LoRA weight updates into the target model parameter space. Both
components are data-free, training-free, and enable lightweight adaptation on a
commodity GPU in 20 minutes. Experiments on ARCs, OBOA and HellaSwag show that
Cross-LoRA achieves relative gains of up to 5.26% over base models. Across
other commonsense reasoning benchmarks, Cross-LoRA maintains performance
comparable to that of directly trained LoRA adapters.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的Mixture-of-Basis-Experts (MoBE)方法，用于压缩大型MoE模型，显著减少了参数数量，同时仅带来微小的准确率下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)架构在扩展大型语言模型方面表现出色，但其部署时的高内存需求成为主要挑战。现有压缩方法通常导致较大的准确率下降。

Method: MoBE通过将每个专家的权重矩阵分解为A和B两部分，其中B进一步参数化为共享基矩阵的线性组合，从而减少参数数量。

Result: 实验表明，MoBE在压缩Qwen3-235B-A22B-2507等模型时，参数减少24%-30%，准确率仅下降1%-2%（相对下降约2%）。

Conclusion: MoBE是一种高效的MoE模型压缩方法，显著降低了内存需求，同时保持了较高的模型性能。

Abstract: The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture has become a predominant paradigm
for scaling large language models (LLMs). Despite offering strong performance
and computational efficiency, large MoE-based LLMs like DeepSeek-V3-0324 and
Kimi-K2-Instruct present serious challenges due to substantial memory
requirements in deployment. While recent works have explored MoE compression to
address this issue, existing methods often suffer from considerable accuracy
drops (e.g., 7-14% relatively) even at modest compression rates. This paper
introduces a novel Mixture-of-Basis-Experts (MoBE) method that achieves model
compression while incurring minimal accuracy drops. Specifically, each up/gate
matrix in an expert is decomposed via a rank decomposition as W = AB, where
matrix A is unique to each expert. The relatively larger matrix B is further
re-parameterized as a linear combination of basis matrices {Bi} shared across
all experts within a given MoE layer. The factorization is learned by
minimizing the reconstruction error relative to the original weight matrices.
Experiments demonstrate that MoBE achieves notably lower accuracy drops
compared to prior works. For instance, MoBE can reduce the parameter counts of
Qwen3-235B-A22B-2507, DeepSeek-V3-0324 (671B) and Kimi-K2-Instruct (1T) by
24%-30% with only 1%-2% accuracy drop (about 2% drops when measured
relatively).

Abstract: Marine chlorophyll concentration is an important indicator of ecosystem
health and carbon cycle strength, and its accurate prediction is crucial for
red tide warning and ecological response. In this paper, we propose a LSTM-RF
hybrid model that combines the advantages of LSTM and RF, which solves the
deficiencies of a single model in time-series modelling and nonlinear feature
portrayal. Trained with multi-source ocean data(temperature, salinity,
dissolved oxygen, etc.), the experimental results show that the LSTM-RF model
has an R^2 of 0.5386, an MSE of 0.005806, and an MAE of 0.057147 on the test
set, which is significantly better than using LSTM (R^2 = 0.0208) and RF (R^2
=0.4934) alone , respectively. The standardised treatment and sliding window
approach improved the prediction accuracy of the model and provided an
innovative solution for high-frequency prediction of marine ecological

Method: 采用状态空间模型（SSM）编码器和函数基解码器，支持连续时间建模和动态时间尺度调整。

Result: FlowState在GIFT-ZS和Chronos-ZS基准测试中表现最优，且模型更小、数据需求更低、效率更高。

Conclusion: FlowState通过创新设计和高效预训练策略，显著提升了时间序列预测的性能和适应性。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) have transformed natural language processing, but
their success has not yet translated to time series forecasting. Existing time
series foundation models (TSFMs), often based on transformer variants, struggle
with generalization across varying context and target lengths, lack
adaptability to different sampling rates, and are computationally inefficient.
We introduce FlowState, a novel TSFM architecture that addresses these
challenges through two key innovations: a state space model (SSM) based encoder
and a functional basis decoder. This design enables continuous-time modeling
and dynamic time-scale adjustment, allowing FlowState to inherently generalize
across all possible temporal resolutions, and dynamically adjust the
forecasting horizons. In contrast to other state-of-the-art TSFMs, which
require training data across all possible sampling rates to memorize patterns
at each scale, FlowState inherently adapts its internal dynamics to the input
scale, enabling smaller models, reduced data requirements, and improved
efficiency. We further propose an efficient pretraining strategy that improves
robustness and accelerates training. Despite being the smallest model,
FlowState outperforms all other models and is state-of-the-art for the GIFT-ZS
and the Chronos-ZS benchmarks. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of
its components, and we demonstrate its unique ability to adapt online to
varying input sampling rates.

Abstract: Conversational recommender systems (CRS) based on Large Language Models
(LLMs) need to constantly be aligned to the user preferences to provide
satisfying and context-relevant item recommendations. The traditional
supervised fine-tuning cannot capture the implicit feedback signal, e.g., dwell
time, sentiment polarity, or engagement patterns. In this paper, we share a
fine-tuning solution using human feedback reinforcement learning (RLHF) to
maximize implied user feedback (IUF) in a multi-turn recommendation context. We
specify a reward model $R_{\phi}$ learnt on weakly-labelled engagement
information and maximize user-centric utility by optimizing the foundational
LLM M_{\theta} through a proximal policy optimization (PPO) approach. The
architecture models conversational state transitions $s_t \to a_t \to s_{t
+1}$, where the action $a_t$ is associated with LLM-generated item suggestions
only on condition of conversation history in the past. The evaluation across
synthetic and real-world datasets (e.g.REDIAL, OpenDialKG) demonstrates that
our RLHF-fine-tuned models can perform better in terms of top-$k$
recommendation accuracy, coherence, and user satisfaction compared to

Motivation: 深度学习模型的快速增长带来了计算瓶颈，批量大小和学习率的调度对训练效率至关重要，但简单的调度可能影响优化效率和泛化能力。

Method: 基于随机一阶预言机（SFO）复杂度理论，推导了批量大小和学习率的最优增长计划，并通过实验验证。

Result: 理论分析和实验验证表明，提出的调度计划能有效减少计算复杂度。

Conclusion: 研究为深度学习的大批量训练提供了理论指导和实践建议。

Abstract: The unprecedented growth of deep learning models has enabled remarkable
advances but introduced substantial computational bottlenecks. A key factor
contributing to training efficiency is batch-size and learning-rate scheduling
in stochastic gradient methods. However, naive scheduling of these
hyperparameters can degrade optimization efficiency and compromise
generalization. Motivated by recent theoretical insights, we investigated how
the batch size and learning rate should be increased during training to balance
efficiency and convergence. We analyzed this problem on the basis of stochastic
first-order oracle (SFO) complexity, defined as the expected number of gradient
evaluations needed to reach an $\epsilon$-approximate stationary point of the
empirical loss. We theoretically derived optimal growth schedules for the batch
size and learning rate that reduce SFO complexity and validated them through
extensive experiments. Our results offer both theoretical insights and
practical guidelines for scalable and efficient large-batch training in deep
learning.

Result: 实验表明，基于该策略的自适应联合调度器比现有调度器具有更快的收敛速度。

Conclusion: 自适应调度策略通过动态调整批大小和学习率，显著提高了SGD的收敛效率。

Abstract: The convergence behavior of mini-batch stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is
highly sensitive to the batch size and learning rate settings. Recent
theoretical studies have identified the existence of a critical batch size that
minimizes stochastic first-order oracle (SFO) complexity, defined as the
expected number of gradient evaluations required to reach a stationary point of
the empirical loss function in a deep neural network. An adaptive scheduling
strategy is introduced to accelerate SGD that leverages theoretical findings on
the critical batch size. The batch size and learning rate are adjusted on the
basis of the observed decay in the full gradient norm during training.
Experiments using an adaptive joint scheduler based on this strategy
demonstrated improved convergence speed compared with that of existing
schedulers.

unlabeled data in a sequential learning setup, aiming to reduce annotation
costs while managing continual data arrival. SSCL introduces complex
challenges, including ensuring effective unlabeled learning (UL), while
balancing memory stability (MS) and learning plasticity (LP). Previous SSCL
efforts have typically focused on isolated aspects of the three, while this
work presents USP, a divide-and-conquer framework designed to synergistically
enhance these three aspects: (1) Feature Space Reservation (FSR) strategy for
LP, which constructs reserved feature locations for future classes by shaping
old classes into an equiangular tight frame; (2) Divide-and-Conquer
Pseudo-labeling (DCP) approach for UL, which assigns reliable pseudo-labels
across both high- and low-confidence unlabeled data; and (3)
Class-mean-anchored Unlabeled Distillation (CUD) for MS, which reuses DCP's
outputs to anchor unlabeled data to stable class means for distillation to
prevent forgetting. Comprehensive evaluations show USP outperforms prior SSCL
methods, with gains up to 5.94% in the last accuracy, validating its
effectiveness. The code is available at https://github.com/NJUyued/USP4SSCL.

TL;DR: Fairy±i提出了一种新的2位量化框架，通过复数域提升全精度模型的准确性，并实现无乘法推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前QAT研究仅关注最小化量化误差，未尝试超越全精度模型的准确性上限。

Method: 利用复数域表示优势，将权重映射到四元根{±1, ±i}，实现对称且信息最优的2位表示。

Result: Fairy±i在PPL和下游任务上超越现有2位量化方法的准确性上限，同时保持存储和计算效率。

Conclusion: 该工作为极低比特约束下构建高精度实用LLM开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) integrates quantization into the training
loop, enabling LLMs to learn robust low-bit representations, and is widely
recognized as one of the most promising research directions. All current QAT
research focuses on minimizing quantization error on full-precision models,
where the full-precision accuracy acts as an upper bound (accuracy ceiling). No
existing method has even attempted to surpass this ceiling. To break this
ceiling, we propose a new paradigm: raising the ceiling (full-precision model),
and then still quantizing it efficiently into 2 bits. We propose Fairy$\pm i$,
the first 2-bit quantization framework for complex-valued LLMs. Specifically,
our method leverages the representational advantages of the complex domain to
boost full-precision accuracy. We map weights to the fourth roots of unity
$\{\pm1, \pm i\}$, forming a perfectly symmetric and information-theoretically
optimal 2-bit representation. Importantly, each quantized weight has either a
zero real or imaginary part, enabling multiplication-free inference using only
additions and element swaps. Experimental results show that Fairy$\pm i$
outperforms the ceiling of existing 2-bit quantization approaches in terms of
both PPL and downstream tasks, while maintaining strict storage and compute
efficiency. This work opens a new direction for building highly accurate and
practical LLMs under extremely low-bit constraints.

*Yi-Hsiu Liao,Cheng Shen,Brenda,Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OCAT（Optimal Corpus Aware Training）是一种轻量级、抗过拟合且能提升模型准确性的方法，通过微调CAT预训练模型中的少量语料相关参数实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CAT方法在训练前需预定义高质量数据组，容易出错且效率低，OCAT旨在解决这一问题。

Method: OCAT通过冻结大部分模型参数，仅微调少量与语料相关的参数，优化CAT预训练模型。

Result: 在WMT23英中和英德翻译任务中，OCAT分别取得+3.6和+1.8 chrF的提升，性能与SOTA方法相当或略优。

Conclusion: OCAT是一种高效且稳健的微调方法，对超参数设置不敏感，优于传统训练方法。

Abstract: Corpus Aware Training (CAT) leverages valuable corpus metadata during
training by injecting corpus information into each training example, and has
been found effective in the literature, commonly known as the "tagging"
approach. Models trained with CAT inherently learn the quality, domain and
nuance between corpora directly from data, and can easily switch to different
inference behavior. To achieve the best evaluation, CAT models pre-define a
group of high quality data before training starts which can be error-prone and
inefficient. In this work, we propose Optimal Corpus Aware Training (OCAT),
which fine-tunes a CAT pre-trained model by freezing most of the model
parameters and only tuning small set of corpus-related parameters. We show that
OCAT is lightweight, resilient to overfitting, and effective in boosting model
accuracy. We use WMT23 English to Chinese and English to German translation
tasks as our test ground and show +3.6 and +1.8 chrF improvement, respectively,
over vanilla training. Furthermore, our approach is on-par or slightly better
than other state-of-the-art fine-tuning techniques while being less sensitive
to hyperparameter settings.

Conclusion: LLMs在生成可解释CPs方面具有潜力，可用于临床决策支持，尤其是在资源有限的情况下。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities for
medical question answering and programming, but their potential for generating
interpretable computable phenotypes (CPs) is under-explored. In this work, we
investigate whether LLMs can generate accurate and concise CPs for six clinical
phenotypes of varying complexity, which could be leveraged to enable scalable
clinical decision support to improve care for patients with hypertension. In
addition to evaluating zero-short performance, we propose and test a
synthesize, execute, debug, instruct strategy that uses LLMs to generate and
iteratively refine CPs using data-driven feedback. Our results show that LLMs,
coupled with iterative learning, can generate interpretable and reasonably
accurate programs that approach the performance of state-of-the-art ML methods
while requiring significantly fewer training examples.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决个性化任务中潜在老虎机模型难以构建的问题，尤其是当潜在状态无法完全解释所有个体响应时。

Method: 提出了一种后验采样算法，仅依赖潜在状态下动作的偏好排序，而非完整的奖励分布。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在奖励分布已知时性能与潜在老虎机相当，在奖励尺度不同时表现更优。

Conclusion: 放宽潜在老虎机的假设，仅依赖偏好排序，能够有效提升个性化任务中的性能。

Abstract: Bandit algorithms are guaranteed to solve diverse sequential decision-making
problems, provided that a sufficient exploration budget is available. However,
learning from scratch is often too costly for personalization tasks where a
single individual faces only a small number of decision points. Latent bandits
offer substantially reduced exploration times for such problems, given that the
joint distribution of a latent state and the rewards of actions is known and
accurate. In practice, finding such a model is non-trivial, and there may not
exist a small number of latent states that explain the responses of all
individuals. For example, patients with similar latent conditions may have the
same preference in treatments but rate their symptoms on different scales. With
this in mind, we propose relaxing the assumptions of latent bandits to require
only a model of the \emph{preference ordering} of actions in each latent state.
This allows problem instances with the same latent state to vary in their
reward distributions, as long as their preference orderings are equal. We give
a posterior-sampling algorithm for this problem and demonstrate that its
empirical performance is competitive with latent bandits that have full
knowledge of the reward distribution when this is well-specified, and
outperforms them when reward scales differ between instances with the same
latent state.

TL;DR: Echo是一个RL系统，通过将推理和训练阶段解耦到异构集群上，解决了现代RL后训练中GPU集群的串行切换问题，同时保持统计效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代RL后训练中，GPU集群需要在推理和训练工作负载之间切换，违反了SPMD假设，影响了效率。

Method: Echo引入两种轻量级同步协议：顺序拉取模式和异步推送-拉取模式，分别用于最小化偏差和最大化硬件利用率。

Result: 在分布式集群上训练三种RL工作负载时，Echo在收敛速度和最终奖励上与完全共置的基线相当，同时将轨迹生成卸载到边缘硬件。

Conclusion: Echo证明，利用分散的异构资源可以实现大规模RL的高性能。

Abstract: Modern RL-based post-training for large language models (LLMs) co-locate
trajectory sampling and policy optimisation on the same GPU cluster, forcing
the system to switch between inference and training workloads. This serial
context switching violates the single-program-multiple-data (SPMD) assumption
underlying today's distributed training systems. We present Echo, the RL system
that cleanly decouples these two phases across heterogeneous "inference" and
"training" swarms while preserving statistical efficiency. Echo introduces two
lightweight synchronization protocols: a sequential pull mode that refreshes
sampler weights on every API call for minimal bias, and an asynchronous
push-pull mode that streams version-tagged rollouts through a replay buffer to
maximise hardware utilisation. Training three representative RL workloads with
Qwen3-4B, Qwen2.5-7B and Qwen3-32B on a geographically distributed cluster,
Echo matches a fully co-located Verl baseline in convergence speed and final
reward while off-loading trajectory generation to commodity edge hardware.
These promising results demonstrate that large-scale RL for LLMs could achieve
datacentre-grade performance using decentralised, heterogeneous resources.

Method: 采用非目标标签训练（NT）和相互学习（ML），通过教师模型和学生模型的协同学习，提升模型对干净数据的准确性。

Result: 实验表明，NT-ML能有效抵御6种后门攻击，性能优于5种现有防御方法。

Conclusion: NT-ML是一种高效的后门攻击防御方法，适用于少量干净样本的场景。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to
backdoor attacks, where a designed trigger is injected into the dataset,
causing erroneous predictions when activated. In this paper, we propose a novel
defense mechanism, Non-target label Training and Mutual Learning (NT-ML), which
can successfully restore the poisoned model under advanced backdoor attacks. NT
aims to reduce the harm of poisoned data by retraining the model with the
outputs of the standard training. At this stage, a teacher model with high
accuracy on clean data and a student model with higher confidence in correct
prediction on poisoned data are obtained. Then, the teacher and student can
learn the strengths from each other through ML to obtain a purified student
model. Extensive experiments show that NT-ML can effectively defend against 6
backdoor attacks with a small number of clean samples, and outperforms 5
state-of-the-art backdoor defenses.

Result: 通过实验比较了SGD和Adam优化器（带和不带自适应学习率）的性能，并评估了自适应策略的实际优势。

Conclusion: 本文明确了自适应学习率策略的适用场景和优势，为优化器的选择提供了指导。

Abstract: The learning rate is a crucial hyperparameter in deep learning, with its
ideal value depending on the problem and potentially changing during training.
In this paper, we investigate the practical utility of adaptive learning rate
mechanisms that adjust step sizes dynamically in response to the loss
landscape. We revisit a cumulative path-based adaptation scheme proposed in
2017, which adjusts the learning rate based on the discrepancy between the
observed path length, computed as a time-discounted sum of normalized gradient
steps, and the expected length of a random walk. While the original approach
offers a compelling intuition, we show that its adaptation mechanism for Adam
is conceptually inconsistent due to the optimizer's internal preconditioning.
We propose a corrected variant that better reflects Adam's update dynamics. To
assess the practical value of online learning rate adaptation, we benchmark SGD
and Adam, with and without cumulative adaptation, and compare them to a recent
alternative method. Our results aim to clarify when and why such adaptive
strategies offer practical benefits.

Abstract: Molecular generation conditioned on textual descriptions is a fundamental
task in computational chemistry and drug discovery. Existing methods often
struggle to simultaneously ensure high-quality, diverse generation and fast
inference. In this work, we propose a novel causality-aware framework that
addresses these challenges through two key innovations. First, we introduce a
Causality-Aware Transformer (CAT) that jointly encodes molecular graph tokens
and text instructions while enforcing causal dependencies during generation.
Second, we develop a Variational Mean Flow (VMF) framework that generalizes
existing flow-based methods by modeling the latent space as a mixture of
Gaussians, enhancing expressiveness beyond unimodal priors. VMF enables
efficient one-step inference while maintaining strong generation quality and
diversity. Extensive experiments on four standard molecular benchmarks
demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving
higher novelty (up to 74.5\%), diversity (up to 70.3\%), and 100\% validity
across all datasets. Moreover, VMF requires only one number of function
evaluation (NFE) during conditional generation and up to five NFEs for
unconditional generation, offering substantial computational efficiency over
diffusion-based methods.

Abstract: Forecasting stock and cryptocurrency prices is challenging due to high
volatility and non-stationarity, influenced by factors like economic changes
and market sentiment. Previous research shows that Echo State Networks (ESNs)
can effectively model short-term stock market movements, capturing nonlinear
patterns in dynamic data. To the best of our knowledge, this work is among the
first to explore ESNs for cryptocurrency forecasting, especially during extreme
volatility. We also conduct chaos analysis through the Lyapunov exponent in
chaotic periods and show that our approach outperforms existing machine
learning methods by a significant margin. Our findings are consistent with the
Lyapunov exponent analysis, showing that ESNs are robust during chaotic periods
and excel under high chaos compared to Boosting and Na\"ive methods.

Motivation: 传统VAE无法准确建模神经元放电的变异性，Poisson-VAE虽引入泊松分布但仍限制均值与方差相等，无法反映真实的神经活动随机性。

Method: 提出NegBio-VAE，利用负二项分布建模放电计数，引入分散参数，开发两种ELBO优化方案和可微分重参数化策略。

Result: 实验表明，NegBio-VAE通过显式建模过度分散，显著提高了重建保真度。

Conclusion: NegBio-VAE通过负二项分布更准确地建模神经元放电，强调了显式建模过度分散的重要性。

Abstract: Biological neurons communicate through spike trains, discrete, irregular
bursts of activity that exhibit variability far beyond the modeling capacity of
conventional variational autoencoders (VAEs). Recent work, such as the
Poisson-VAE, makes a biologically inspired move by modeling spike counts using
the Poisson distribution. However, they impose a rigid constraint: equal mean
and variance, which fails to reflect the true stochastic nature of neural
activity. In this work, we challenge this constraint and introduce NegBio-VAE,
a principled extension of the VAE framework that models spike counts using the
negative binomial distribution. This shift grants explicit control over
dispersion, unlocking a broader and more accurate family of neural
representations. We further develop two ELBO optimization schemes and two
differentiable reparameterization strategies tailored to the negative binomial
setting. By introducing one additional dispersion parameter, NegBio-VAE
generalizes the Poisson latent model to a negative binomial formulation.
Empirical results demonstrate this minor yet impactful change leads to
significant gains in reconstruction fidelity, highlighting the importance of
explicitly modeling overdispersion in spike-like activations.

Motivation: 解决联邦学习中FedAvg忽视少数客户端公平性的问题。

Method: 引入锥形正则化FMOL（CR-FMOL），通过偏好锥约束实现客户端帕累托最优。

Result: 在非IID数据上，CR-FMOL提升了客户端公平性，早期性能略低于FedAvg，但长期可达到相近精度。

Conclusion: CR-FMOL是首个实现客户端帕累托最优的联邦MOO框架，有望在长期训练中平衡公平性与性能。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a widely adopted paradigm for privacy-preserving
model training, but FedAvg optimise for the majority while under-serving
minority clients. Existing methods such as federated multi-objective learning
(FMOL) attempts to import multi-objective optimisation (MOO) into FL. However,
it merely delivers task-wise Pareto-stationary points, leaving client fairness
to chance. In this paper, we introduce Conically-Regularised FMOL (CR-FMOL),
the first federated MOO framework that enforces client-wise Pareto optimality
through a novel preference-cone constraint. After local federated
multi-gradient descent averaging (FMGDA) / federated stochastic multi-gradient
descent averaging (FSMGDA) steps, each client transmits its aggregated
task-loss vector as an implicit preference; the server then solves a
cone-constrained Pareto-MTL sub-problem centred at the uniform vector,
producing a descent direction that is Pareto-stationary for every client within
its cone. Experiments on non-IID benchmarks show that CR-FMOL enhances client
fairness, and although the early-stage performance is slightly inferior to
FedAvg, it is expected to achieve comparable accuracy given sufficient training
rounds.

Result: GCPO在多个推理基准测试中表现优于GRPO等现有方法。

Conclusion: GCPO通过整合因果结构优化策略，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have broadened their
applicability across diverse tasks, yet specialized domains still require
targeted post training. Among existing methods, Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) stands out for its efficiency, leveraging groupwise
relative rewards while avoiding costly value function learning. However, GRPO
treats candidate responses as independent, overlooking semantic interactions
such as complementarity and contradiction. To address this challenge, we first
introduce a Structural Causal Model (SCM) that reveals hidden dependencies
among candidate responses induced by conditioning on a final integrated output
forming a collider structure. Then, our causal analysis leads to two insights:
(1) projecting responses onto a causally informed subspace improves prediction
quality, and (2) this projection yields a better baseline than query only
conditioning. Building on these insights, we propose Group Causal Policy
Optimization (GCPO), which integrates causal structure into optimization
through two key components: a causally informed reward adjustment and a novel
KL regularization term that aligns the policy with a causally projected
reference distribution. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that
GCPO consistently surpasses existing methods, including GRPO across multiple
reasoning benchmarks.

Motivation: 深度强化学习在性能上表现出色，但缺乏可解释性，限制了其在安全关键任务中的实际应用。MLES旨在解决这一矛盾。

Method: MLES利用多模态大语言模型生成策略，结合进化机制进行自动优化，并通过视觉反馈分析失败模式以改进策略。

Conclusion: MLES克服了预定义领域特定语言的限制，支持知识迁移和重用，有望成为下一代可解释控制策略发现的领先方法。

Abstract: Interpretability and high performance are essential goals in designing
control policies, particularly for safety-critical tasks. Deep reinforcement
learning has greatly enhanced performance, yet its inherent lack of
interpretability often undermines trust and hinders real-world deployment. This
work addresses these dual challenges by introducing a novel approach for
programmatic policy discovery, called Multimodal Large Language Model-assisted
Evolutionary Search (MLES). MLES utilizes multimodal large language models as
policy generators, combining them with evolutionary mechanisms for automatic
policy optimization. It integrates visual feedback-driven behavior analysis
within the policy generation process to identify failure patterns and
facilitate targeted improvements, enhancing the efficiency of policy discovery
and producing adaptable, human-aligned policies. Experimental results show that
MLES achieves policy discovery capabilities and efficiency comparable to
Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) across two control tasks, while offering
transparent control logic and traceable design processes. This paradigm
overcomes the limitations of predefined domain-specific languages, facilitates
knowledge transfer and reuse, and is scalable across various control tasks.
MLES shows promise as a leading approach for the next generation of
interpretable control policy discovery.

Abstract: Accurate time-to-event prediction is integral to decision-making, informing
medical guidelines, hiring decisions, and resource allocation. Survival
analysis, the quantitative framework used to model time-to-event data, accounts
for patients who do not experience the event of interest during the study
period, known as censored patients. However, many patients experience events
that prevent the observation of the outcome of interest. These competing risks
are often treated as censoring, a practice frequently overlooked due to a
limited understanding of its consequences. Our work theoretically demonstrates
why treating competing risks as censoring introduces substantial bias in
survival estimates, leading to systematic overestimation of risk and,
critically, amplifying disparities. First, we formalize the problem of
misclassifying competing risks as censoring and quantify the resulting error in
survival estimates. Specifically, we develop a framework to estimate this error
and demonstrate the associated implications for predictive performance and
algorithmic fairness. Furthermore, we examine how differing risk profiles
across demographic groups lead to group-specific errors, potentially
exacerbating existing disparities. Our findings, supported by an empirical
analysis of cardiovascular management, demonstrate that ignoring competing
risks disproportionately impacts the individuals most at risk of these events,
potentially accentuating inequity. By quantifying the error and highlighting
the fairness implications of the common practice of considering competing risks
as censoring, our work provides a critical insight into the development of
survival models: practitioners must account for competing risks to improve
accuracy, reduce disparities in risk assessment, and better inform downstream
decisions.

Result: 实验表明，新方法在尾风险控制和性能上优于基线。

Conclusion: CVaR-MCTS和W-MCTS提供了严格的尾风险保证，提升了稳定性和回报。

Abstract: Making decisions with respect to just the expected returns in Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS) cannot account for the potential range of high-risk, adverse
outcomes associated with a decision. To this end, safety-aware MCTS often
consider some constrained variants -- by introducing some form of mean risk
measures or hard cost thresholds. These approaches fail to provide rigorous
tail-safety guarantees with respect to extreme or high-risk outcomes (denoted
as tail-risk), potentially resulting in serious consequence in high-stake
scenarios. This paper addresses the problem by developing two novel solutions.
We first propose CVaR-MCTS, which embeds a coherent tail risk measure,
Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR), into MCTS. Our CVaR-MCTS with parameter
$\alpha$ achieves explicit tail-risk control over the expected loss in the
"worst $(1-\alpha)\%$ scenarios." Second, we further address the estimation
bias of tail-risk due to limited samples. We propose Wasserstein-MCTS (or
W-MCTS) by introducing a first-order Wasserstein ambiguity set
$\mathcal{P}_{\varepsilon_{s}}(s,a)$ with radius $\varepsilon_{s}$ to
characterize the uncertainty in tail-risk estimates. We prove PAC tail-safety
guarantees for both CVaR-MCTS and W-MCTS and establish their regret.
Evaluations on diverse simulated environments demonstrate that our proposed
methods outperform existing baselines, effectively achieving robust tail-risk
guarantees with improved rewards and stability.

TL;DR: EnergyPatchTST是一种专为能源预测设计的Patch Time Series Transformer扩展方法，通过多尺度特征提取、概率预测框架、未来变量集成和预训练微调，显著提升了预测精度和不确定性估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在能源时间序列预测中存在多尺度动态和真实数据不规则性的局限性，需要更准确的预测方法。

Method: 提出EnergyPatchTST，包括多尺度特征提取、概率预测框架、未来变量集成路径和预训练微调策略。

Result: 在常见能源数据集上，预测误差降低7-12%，并提供可靠的不确定性估计。

Conclusion: EnergyPatchTST为能源领域时间序列预测提供了重要参考，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Accurate and reliable energy time series prediction is of great significance
for power generation planning and allocation. At present, deep learning time
series prediction has become the mainstream method. However, the multi-scale
time dynamics and the irregularity of real data lead to the limitations of the
existing methods. Therefore, we propose EnergyPatchTST, which is an extension
of the Patch Time Series Transformer specially designed for energy forecasting.
The main innovations of our method are as follows: (1) multi-scale feature
extraction mechanism to capture patterns with different time resolutions; (2)
probability prediction framework to estimate uncertainty through Monte Carlo
elimination; (3) integration path of future known variables (such as
temperature and wind conditions); And (4) Pre-training and Fine-tuning examples
to enhance the performance of limited energy data sets. A series of experiments
on common energy data sets show that EnergyPatchTST is superior to other
commonly used methods, the prediction error is reduced by 7-12%, and reliable
uncertainty estimation is provided, which provides an important reference for
time series prediction in the energy field.

TL;DR: 论文通过五种数据无关的探针方法，研究了任务难度对多层感知机（MLP）内部表示拓扑和鲁棒性的影响，揭示了符号二分图拓扑在表示学习中的关键作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络虽然表现出色，但其内部表示的形成机制仍不透明。本文旨在量化任务难度如何影响MLP的表示拓扑和鲁棒性。

Method: 引入五种数据无关的探针方法（剪枝、二值化、噪声注入、符号翻转和二分网络随机化），以网络科学视角分析MLP的符号加权二分图表示。

Result: 在硬任务中，二值化权重导致准确率骤降至随机水平，而简单任务模型仍保持鲁棒性。此外，噪声注入可能提升准确率，符号结构的保留足以维持高精度。

Conclusion: 符号二分图拓扑在表示学习中起关键作用，研究结果为模型压缩和可解释性提供了实用策略。

Abstract: Neural networks excel across a wide range of tasks, yet remain black boxes.
In particular, how their internal representations are shaped by the complexity
of the input data and the problems they solve remains obscure. In this work, we
introduce a suite of five data-agnostic probes-pruning, binarization, noise
injection, sign flipping, and bipartite network randomization-to quantify how
task difficulty influences the topology and robustness of representations in
multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). MLPs are represented as signed, weighted
bipartite graphs from a network science perspective. We contrast easy and hard
classification tasks on the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets. We show that
binarizing weights in hard-task models collapses accuracy to chance, whereas
easy-task models remain robust. We also find that pruning low-magnitude edges
in binarized hard-task models reveals a sharp phase-transition in performance.
Moreover, moderate noise injection can enhance accuracy, resembling a
stochastic-resonance effect linked to optimal sign flips of small-magnitude
weights. Finally, preserving only the sign structure-instead of precise weight
magnitudes-through bipartite network randomizations suffices to maintain high
accuracy. These phenomena define a model- and modality-agnostic measure of task
complexity: the performance gap between full-precision and binarized or
shuffled neural network performance. Our findings highlight the crucial role of
signed bipartite topology in learned representations and suggest practical
strategies for model compression and interpretability that align with task
complexity.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无需真实标签评估AI系统的方法，利用博弈抵抗性与输出质量的关系，证明了f-互信息是唯一满足自然条件的博弈抵抗机制，并在多个领域验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI系统评估常依赖真实标签，但现实中难以获取。论文旨在开发无需真实标签的评估机制，利用博弈抵抗性与输出质量的关系。

Method: 通过数据处理不等式证明博弈抵抗性与任务性能的关系，提出f-互信息作为唯一博弈抵抗机制，并与Shannon互信息对比。

Result: 在翻译、同行评审等十个领域，信息论机制能完美区分忠实与策略性代理，且比现有方法抗对抗攻击能力强10-100倍。

Conclusion: f-互信息机制在无需真实标签的情况下表现优越，且性能随压缩比呈倒U型曲线，峰值在10:1时信息多样性最佳。

Abstract: We develop mechanisms for evaluating AI systems without ground truth by
exploiting a connection between gaming resistance and output quality. The data
processing inequality ensures post-hoc attempts to game a metric degrades both
information content and task performance. We prove that f-mutual information
measures are the unique gaming resistant mechanisms under natural conditions,
with the overseer acting as an agent. While Shannon mutual information faces
exponential sample complexity, bounded measures like total variation distance
remain tractable. Empirically, across ten domains from translation to peer
review, all information-theoretic mechanisms achieve perfect discrimination (d
> 0.5) between faithful and strategic agents. In contrast, LLM judges exhibit
systematic evaluation inversion, preferring fabricated content over accurate
summaries. Our mechanisms show 10-100x better robustness to adversarial
manipulation than current practices. We also find performance follows an
inverted-U curve with compression ratio, peaking at 10:1 where agent responses
exhibit optimal information diversity (3 effective dimensions), giving a
bias-variance perspective on when our approach is expected to be most
effective.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多任务循环神经网络，用于联合建模电子健康记录中的观察间隔和缺失过程，以提高临床预测模型的性能和可迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录中的临床存在（clinical presence）常被忽视，影响预测模型的性能和可迁移性。

Method: 使用多任务循环神经网络，联合建模观察间隔、缺失过程和生存结果。

Result: 在MIMIC-III数据集上的死亡率预测任务中，模型性能优于现有方法，且更具可迁移性。

Conclusion: 临床存在的建模能显著提升预测模型的性能和可迁移性。

Abstract: Electronic health records arise from the complex interaction between patients
and the healthcare system. This observation process of interactions, referred
to as clinical presence, often impacts observed outcomes. When using electronic
health records to develop clinical prediction models, it is standard practice
to overlook clinical presence, impacting performance and limiting the
transportability of models when this interaction evolves. We propose a
multi-task recurrent neural network that jointly models the inter-observation
time and the missingness processes characterising this interaction in parallel
to the survival outcome of interest. Our work formalises the concept of
clinical presence shift when the prediction model is deployed in new settings
(e.g. different hospitals, regions or countries), and we theoretically justify
why the proposed joint modelling can improve transportability under changes in
clinical presence. We demonstrate, in a real-world mortality prediction task in
the MIMIC-III dataset, how the proposed strategy improves performance and
transportability compared to state-of-the-art prediction models that do not
incorporate the observation process. These results emphasise the importance of
leveraging clinical presence to improve performance and create more
transportable clinical prediction models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多视图聚类面临高维特征和无关信息管理的挑战，传统方法需手动调参且缺乏跨视图集成机制。

Method: 采用熵正则化替代模糊参数，结合信噪比加权和双层次熵项，AAMVFCM-U进一步引入分层降维。

Result: 在五个基准测试中优于15种先进方法，AAMVFCM-U计算效率提升97%，降维至原尺寸0.45%。

Conclusion: 提出的框架自动识别关键视图组合，为多视图聚类提供高效、无参数的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-view clustering faces critical challenges in automatically discovering
patterns across heterogeneous data while managing high-dimensional features and
eliminating irrelevant information. Traditional approaches suffer from manual
parameter tuning and lack principled cross-view integration mechanisms. This
work introduces two complementary algorithms: AMVFCM-U and AAMVFCM-U, providing
a unified parameter-free framework. Our approach replaces fuzzification
parameters with entropy regularization terms that enforce adaptive cross-view
consensus. The core innovation employs signal-to-noise ratio based
regularization ($\delta_j^h = \frac{\bar{x}_j^h}{(\sigma_j^h)^2}$) for
principled feature weighting with convergence guarantees, coupled with
dual-level entropy terms that automatically balance view and feature
contributions. AAMVFCM-U extends this with hierarchical dimensionality
reduction operating at feature and view levels through adaptive thresholding
($\theta^{h^{(t)}} = \frac{d_h^{(t)}}{n}$). Evaluation across five diverse
benchmarks demonstrates superiority over 15 state-of-the-art methods. AAMVFCM-U
achieves up to 97% computational efficiency gains, reduces dimensionality to
0.45% of original size, and automatically identifies critical view combinations
for optimal pattern discovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着PCs模型的深度和表达能力增强，数据有限时容易过拟合。论文从对数似然景观角度分析过拟合问题，发现其常由收敛到尖锐最优解引起。

Method: 受神经网络中锐度感知最小化的启发，提出了一种基于Hessian的正则化方法，高效计算对数似然的Hessian迹（尖锐度代理），并设计了一种梯度范数正则化器。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能引导PCs趋向更平坦的最小值，提升泛化性能。

Conclusion: 提出的Hessian迹正则化方法能有效防止PCs过拟合，适用于EM和梯度学习方法。

Abstract: Probabilistic Circuits (PCs) are a class of generative models that allow
exact and tractable inference for a wide range of queries. While recent
developments have enabled the learning of deep and expressive PCs, this
increased capacity can often lead to overfitting, especially when data is
limited. We analyze PC overfitting from a log-likelihood-landscape perspective
and show that it is often caused by convergence to sharp optima that generalize
poorly. Inspired by sharpness aware minimization in neural networks, we propose
a Hessian-based regularizer for training PCs. As a key contribution, we show
that the trace of the Hessian of the log-likelihood-a sharpness proxy that is
typically intractable in deep neural networks-can be computed efficiently for
PCs. Minimizing this Hessian trace induces a gradient-norm-based regularizer
that yields simple closed-form parameter updates for EM, and integrates
seamlessly with gradient based learning methods. Experiments on synthetic and
real-world datasets demonstrate that our method consistently guides PCs toward
flatter minima, improves generalization performance.

Result: 综述了代表性基准测试，并总结了该领域的核心方法和策略。

Conclusion: 本文填补了无监督VLM适应领域缺乏统一综述的空白，提出了分类法并指出了未来研究的挑战和方向。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable generalization
capabilities across a wide range of tasks. However, their performance often
remains suboptimal when directly applied to specific downstream scenarios
without task-specific adaptation. To enhance their utility while preserving
data efficiency, recent research has increasingly focused on unsupervised
adaptation methods that do not rely on labeled data. Despite the growing
interest in this area, there remains a lack of a unified, task-oriented survey
dedicated to unsupervised VLM adaptation. To bridge this gap, we present a
comprehensive and structured overview of the field. We propose a taxonomy based
on the availability and nature of unlabeled visual data, categorizing existing
approaches into four key paradigms: Data-Free Transfer (no data), Unsupervised
Domain Transfer (abundant data), Episodic Test-Time Adaptation (batch data),
and Online Test-Time Adaptation (streaming data). Within this framework, we
analyze core methodologies and adaptation strategies associated with each
paradigm, aiming to establish a systematic understanding of the field.
Additionally, we review representative benchmarks across diverse applications
and highlight open challenges and promising directions for future research. An
actively maintained repository of relevant literature is available at

TL;DR: X-VFL 是一种新的垂直联邦学习框架，解决了数据样本不对齐和缺失特征的问题，并支持本地独立推断。通过 Cross Completion 和 Decision Subspace Alignment 模块，X-VFL 在实验中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 垂直联邦学习（VFL）面临数据样本需完美对齐和需所有客户端联合推断的挑战，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 提出 X-VFL 框架，包含 Cross Completion（XCom）和 Decision Subspace Alignment（DS-Align）模块，处理缺失特征并支持本地推断。

Result: X-VFL 在 CIFAR-10 和 MIMIC-III 数据集上分别提升 15% 和 43% 的准确率。

Conclusion: X-VFL 在数据缺失和本地推断场景下具有显著优势，验证了其实际有效性。

Abstract: Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) enables collaborative learning by
integrating disjoint feature subsets from multiple clients/parties. However,
VFL typically faces two key challenges: i) the requirement for perfectly
aligned data samples across all clients (missing features are not allowed); ii)
the requirement for joint collaborative inference/prediction involving all
clients (it does not support locally independent inference on a single client).
To address these challenges, we propose X-VFL, a new VFL framework designed to
deal with the non-aligned data samples with (partially) missing features and to
support locally independent inference of new data samples for each client. In
particular, we design two novel modules in X-VFL: Cross Completion (XCom) and
Decision Subspace Alignment (DS-Align). XCom can complete/reconstruct missing
features for non-aligned data samples by leveraging information from other
clients. DS-Align aligns local features with completed and global features
across all clients within the decision subspace, thus enabling locally
independent inference at each client. Moreover, we provide convergence theorems
for different algorithms used in training X-VFL, showing an $O(1/\sqrt{T})$
convergence rate for SGD-type algorithms and an $O(1/T)$ rate for PAGE-type
algorithms, where $T$ denotes the number of training update steps. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that X-VFL significantly
outperforms existing methods, e.g., achieving a 15% improvement in accuracy on
the image CIFAR-10 dataset and a 43% improvement on the medical MIMIC-III
dataset. These results validate the practical effectiveness and superiority of
X-VFL, particularly in scenarios involving partially missing features and
locally independent inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识图谱嵌入模型需要正负样本训练，但现有库仅支持基础负采样策略，限制了性能提升。

Method: 开发了一个PyKEEN扩展，集成多种高级负采样器（静态和动态策略），兼容现有工作流。

Result: 通过实验验证了扩展对链接预测任务性能的提升，并为设计更有效策略提供了见解。

Conclusion: 该扩展不仅增强了PyKEEN的功能，还促进了嵌入方法的开发和定制。

Abstract: Embedding methods have become popular due to their scalability on link
prediction and/or triple classification tasks on Knowledge Graphs. Embedding
models are trained relying on both positive and negative samples of triples.
However, in the absence of negative assertions, these must be usually
artificially generated using various negative sampling strategies, ranging from
random corruption to more sophisticated techniques which have an impact on the
overall performance. Most of the popular libraries for knowledge graph
embedding, support only basic such strategies and lack advanced solutions. To
address this gap, we deliver an extension for the popular KGE framework PyKEEN
that integrates a suite of several advanced negative samplers (including both
static and dynamic corruption strategies), within a consistent modular
architecture, to generate meaningful negative samples, while remaining
compatible with existing PyKEEN -based workflows and pipelines. The developed
extension not only enhancesPyKEEN itself but also allows for easier and
comprehensive development of embedding methods and/or for their customization.
As a proof of concept, we present a comprehensive empirical study of the
developed extensions and their impact on the performance (link prediction
tasks) of different embedding methods, which also provides useful insights for
the design of more effective strategies

Result: 证明仅需一个毒样本即可实现零误差后门攻击，且对正常任务性能影响有限。

Conclusion: 一毒假设成立，揭示了后门攻击的高效性和潜在威胁。

Abstract: Backdoor injection attacks are a threat to machine learning models that are
trained on large data collected from untrusted sources; these attacks enable
attackers to inject malicious behavior into the model that can be triggered by
specially crafted inputs. Prior work has established bounds on the success of
backdoor attacks and their impact on the benign learning task, however, an open
question is what amount of poison data is needed for a successful backdoor
attack. Typical attacks either use few samples, but need much information about
the data points or need to poison many data points.
  In this paper, we formulate the one-poison hypothesis: An adversary with one
poison sample and limited background knowledge can inject a backdoor with zero
backdooring-error and without significantly impacting the benign learning task
performance. Moreover, we prove the one-poison hypothesis for linear regression
and linear classification. For adversaries that utilize a direction that is
unused by the benign data distribution for the poison sample, we show that the
resulting model is functionally equivalent to a model where the poison was
excluded from training. We build on prior work on statistical backdoor learning
to show that in all other cases, the impact on the benign learning task is
still limited. We also validate our theoretical results experimentally with
realistic benchmark data sets.

Result: 在多个推理基准测试中，框架表现优于现有强化学习方法，且开销极小。

Conclusion: 数据为中心的调整对提升多模态大语言模型的强化学习效率至关重要。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as an effective post-training
paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language
model (MLLM). However, current RL pipelines often suffer from training
inefficiencies caused by two underexplored issues: Advantage Collapsing, where
most advantages in a batch concentrate near zero, and Rollout Silencing, where
the proportion of rollouts contributing non-zero gradients diminishes over
time. These issues lead to suboptimal gradient updates and hinder long-term
learning efficiency. To address these issues, we propose Shuffle-R1, a simple
yet principled framework that improves RL fine-tuning efficiency by dynamically
restructuring trajectory sampling and batch composition. It introduces (1)
Pairwise Trajectory Sampling, which selects high-contrast trajectories with
large advantages to improve gradient signal quality, and (2) Advantage-based
Trajectory Shuffle, which increases exposure of valuable rollouts through
informed batch reshuffling. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks
show that our framework consistently outperforms strong RL baselines with
minimal overhead. These results highlight the importance of data-centric
adaptations for more efficient RL training in MLLM.

Abstract: We present a simple yet theoretically motivated improvement to Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) for the Large Language Model (LLM), addressing its limited
generalization compared to reinforcement learning (RL). Through mathematical
analysis, we reveal that standard SFT gradients implicitly encode a problematic
reward structure that may severely restrict the generalization capabilities of
model. To rectify this, we propose Dynamic Fine-Tuning (DFT), stabilizing
gradient updates for each token by dynamically rescaling the objective function
with the probability of this token. Remarkably, this single-line code change
significantly outperforms standard SFT across multiple challenging benchmarks
and base models, demonstrating greatly improved generalization. Additionally,
our approach shows competitive results in offline RL settings, offering an
effective yet simpler alternative. This work bridges theoretical insight and
practical solutions, substantially advancing SFT performance. The code will be

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决实际系统中因时间延迟导致的智能体路径冲突问题。

Method: 提出BTPG-max算法，优化Bidirectional TPG（BTPG），增加双向依赖对。

Result: BTPG-max生成更多双向边，提升延迟鲁棒性和实时性能。

Conclusion: BTPG-max在理论和实践中均优于现有方法，显著提升MAPF解决方案的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) requires computing collision-free paths for
multiple agents in shared environment. Most MAPF planners assume that each
agent reaches a specific location at a specific timestep, but this is
infeasible to directly follow on real systems where delays often occur. To
address collisions caused by agents deviating due to delays, the Temporal Plan
Graph (TPG) was proposed, which converts a MAPF time dependent solution into a
time independent set of inter-agent dependencies. Recently, a Bidirectional TPG
(BTPG) was proposed which relaxed some dependencies into ``bidirectional pairs"
and improved efficiency of agents executing their MAPF solution with delays.
Our work improves upon this prior work by designing an algorithm, BPTG-max,
that finds more bidirectional pairs. Our main theoretical contribution is in
designing the BTPG-max algorithm is locally optimal, i.e. which constructs a
BTPG where no additional bidirectional pairs can be added. We also show how in
practice BTPG-max leads to BTPGs with significantly more bidirectional edges,
superior anytime behavior, and improves robustness to delays.

Conclusion: CMPP能有效提升多智能体系统在物流和自动驾驶等实际应用中的性能。

Abstract: In high-density environments where numerous autonomous agents move
simultaneously in a distributed manner, streamlining global flows to mitigate
local congestion is crucial to maintain overall navigation efficiency. This
paper introduces a novel path-planning problem, congestion mitigation path
planning (CMPP), which embeds congestion directly into the cost function,
defined by the usage of incoming edges along agents' paths. CMPP assigns a
flow-based multiplicative penalty to each vertex of a sparse graph, which grows
steeply where frequently-traversed paths intersect, capturing the intuition
that congestion intensifies where many agents enter the same area from
different directions. Minimizing the total cost yields a set of coarse-level,
time-independent routes that autonomous agents can follow while applying their
own local collision avoidance. We formulate the problem and develop two
solvers: (i) an exact mixed-integer nonlinear programming solver for small
instances, and (ii) a scalable two-layer search algorithm, A-CMTS, which
quickly finds suboptimal solutions for large-scale instances and iteratively
refines them toward the optimum. Empirical studies show that augmenting
state-of-the-art collision-avoidance planners with CMPP significantly reduces
local congestion and enhances system throughput in both discrete- and
continuous-space scenarios. These results indicate that CMPP improves the
performance of multi-agent systems in real-world applications such as logistics
and autonomous-vehicle operations.

TL;DR: 论文提出JPS方法，通过视觉扰动和文本引导协同攻击多模态大语言模型（MLLMs），并引入MIFR指标评估攻击效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究过于关注攻击成功率（ASR），忽略了攻击内容是否真正满足恶意意图，导致输出质量低。

Method: JPS结合目标导向的视觉扰动和优化后的文本提示，通过多智能体系统迭代优化，实现高效攻击。

Result: 实验表明JPS在ASR和MIFR上均达到最新水平。

Conclusion: JPS通过协同优化视觉和文本组件，显著提升了攻击效果和输出质量。

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks against multimodal large language Models (MLLMs) are a
significant research focus. Current research predominantly focuses on
maximizing attack success rate (ASR), often overlooking whether the generated
responses actually fulfill the attacker's malicious intent. This oversight
frequently leads to low-quality outputs that bypass safety filters but lack
substantial harmful content. To address this gap, we propose JPS,
\underline{J}ailbreak MLLMs with collaborative visual \underline{P}erturbation
and textual \underline{S}teering, which achieves jailbreaks via corporation of
visual image and textually steering prompt. Specifically, JPS utilizes
target-guided adversarial image perturbations for effective safety bypass,
complemented by "steering prompt" optimized via a multi-agent system to
specifically guide LLM responses fulfilling the attackers' intent. These visual
and textual components undergo iterative co-optimization for enhanced
performance. To evaluate the quality of attack outcomes, we propose the
Malicious Intent Fulfillment Rate (MIFR) metric, assessed using a
Reasoning-LLM-based evaluator. Our experiments show JPS sets a new
state-of-the-art in both ASR and MIFR across various MLLMs and benchmarks, with
analyses confirming its efficacy. Codes are available at

TL;DR: 论文探讨了LLM生成的代码在创意编码（如实时编码）中的应用，提出了一种模型来预测代码与音频嵌入空间的关系，以生成更多样化的音乐输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是解决LLM在生成代码时难以提供多样化和独特的代码候选方案，且无法直接感知代码生成的音频效果的问题。

Method: 方法包括分析代码与音频嵌入空间的拓扑关系，并构建一个预测模型来学习代码与音频嵌入的对齐映射。

Result: 研究发现代码与音频嵌入之间不存在简单的线性关系，但可以通过构建的预测模型学习到对齐映射。

Conclusion: 结论是通过构建代码与音频嵌入的对齐映射，可以更好地支持生成多样化的音乐输出。

Abstract: LLM-powered code generation has the potential to revolutionize creative
coding endeavors, such as live-coding, by enabling users to focus on structural
motifs over syntactic details. In such domains, when prompting an LLM, users
may benefit from considering multiple varied code candidates to better realize
their musical intentions. Code generation models, however, struggle to present
unique and diverse code candidates, with no direct insight into the code's
audio output. To better establish a relationship between code candidates and
produced audio, we investigate the topology of the mapping between code and
audio embedding spaces. We find that code and audio embeddings do not exhibit a
simple linear relationship, but supplement this with a constructed predictive
model that shows an embedding alignment map could be learned. Supplementing the
aim for musically diverse output, we present a model that given code predicts
output audio embedding, constructing a code-audio embedding alignment map.

*Morten Roed Frederiksen,Kasper Støy*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 研究机器人通过主动分享事件反应对人类感知其情感影响的作用，发现共享反应和特定延迟时间能显著改变人类感知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升机器人在社交环境中的功能，探索其情感表达对人类感知的影响。

Method: 设计两个实验：一是隔离机器人反应的情感表达，二是测试不同反应延迟时间对物理互动的影响。

Result: 共享事件反应显著影响人类感知（p<0.05）；近人类反应时间（200ms）最适合小型非人形机器人。

Conclusion: 200ms延迟对人类感知影响最大，100ms延迟则让人类感觉对机器人影响最大。

Abstract: In an effort to improve how robots function in social contexts, this paper
investigates if a robot that actively shares a reaction to an event with a
human alters how the human perceives the robot's affective impact. To verify
this, we created two different test setups. One to highlight and isolate the
reaction element of affective robot expressions, and one to investigate the
effects of applying specific timing delays to a robot reacting to a physical
encounter with a human. The first test was conducted with two different groups
(n=84) of human observers, a test group and a control group both interacting
with the robot. The second test was performed with 110 participants using
increasingly longer reaction delays for the robot with every ten participants.
The results show a statistically significant change (p$<$.05) in perceived
affective impact for the robots when they react to an event shared with a human
observer rather than reacting at random. The result also shows for shared
physical interaction, the near-human reaction times from the robot are most
appropriate for the scenario. The paper concludes that a delay time around
200ms may render the biggest impact on human observers for small-sized
non-humanoid robots. It further concludes that a slightly shorter reaction time
around 100ms is most effective when the goal is to make the human observers
feel they made the biggest impact on the robot.

TL;DR: INTENTION框架通过结合视觉语言模型和交互驱动记忆，赋予机器人学习交互直觉和自主操作能力，适用于多样化场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器人控制依赖精确物理模型和预定义动作序列，在真实场景中因建模不准确和泛化能力不足而受限。人类则通过直觉和适应性高效决策，启发研究如何赋予机器人类似能力。

Method: 提出INTENTION框架，整合视觉语言模型（VLMs）的场景推理和交互驱动记忆（Memory Graph），并设计Intuitive Perceptor提取物理关系和视觉场景的可操作性。

Result: 机器人能够在无需重复指令的情况下，在新场景中推断出合适的交互行为。

Conclusion: INTENTION框架通过模拟人类直觉和记忆机制，显著提升了机器人在多样化场景中的自主操作能力。

Abstract: Traditional control and planning for robotic manipulation heavily rely on
precise physical models and predefined action sequences. While effective in
structured environments, such approaches often fail in real-world scenarios due
to modeling inaccuracies and struggle to generalize to novel tasks. In
contrast, humans intuitively interact with their surroundings, demonstrating
remarkable adaptability, making efficient decisions through implicit physical
understanding. In this work, we propose INTENTION, a novel framework enabling
robots with learned interactive intuition and autonomous manipulation in
diverse scenarios, by integrating Vision-Language Models (VLMs) based scene
reasoning with interaction-driven memory. We introduce Memory Graph to record
scenes from previous task interactions which embodies human-like understanding
and decision-making about different tasks in real world. Meanwhile, we design
an Intuitive Perceptor that extracts physical relations and affordances from
visual scenes. Together, these components empower robots to infer appropriate
interaction behaviors in new scenes without relying on repetitive instructions.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于分层循环合并调节（HCMR）的算法，用于解决多机器人在已知环境中的双重覆盖问题，优化路径规划并减少任务时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 双重覆盖问题需要机器人在覆盖线性特征（如裂缝）和探索区域（如停车场）时高效且无碰撞地工作，但现有方法在路径长度和任务时间上仍有优化空间。

Method: 通过分层循环合并调节（HCMR）算法，结合Morse理论分析流形附着过程，生成满足最短路径和无碰撞约束的优化路径。

Result: HCMR算法在模拟中显著优于现有方法，路径长度减少至少10.0%，任务时间平均减少16.9%，并确保无冲突操作。

Conclusion: HCMR算法在固定扫描方向下被证明是最优的，为多机器人双重覆盖问题提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: The double coverage problem focuses on determining efficient, collision-free
routes for multiple robots to simultaneously cover linear features (e.g.,
surface cracks or road routes) and survey areas (e.g., parking lots or local
regions) in known environments. In these problems, each robot carries two
functional roles: service (linear feature footprint coverage) and exploration
(complete area coverage). Service has a smaller operational footprint but
incurs higher costs (e.g., time) compared to exploration. We present optimal
planning algorithms for the double coverage problems using hierarchical cyclic
merging regulation (HCMR). To reduce the complexity for optimal planning
solutions, we analyze the manifold attachment process during graph traversal
from a Morse theory perspective. We show that solutions satisfying minimum path
length and collision-free constraints must belong to a Morse-bounded
collection. To identify this collection, we introduce the HCMR algorithm. In
HCMR, cyclic merging search regulates traversal behavior, while edge sequence
back propagation converts these regulations into graph edge traversal
sequences. Incorporating balanced partitioning, the optimal sequence is
selected to generate routes for each robot. We prove the optimality of the HCMR
algorithm under a fixed sweep direction. The multi-robot simulation results
demonstrate that the HCMR algorithm significantly improves planned path length
by at least 10.0%, reduces task time by at least 16.9% in average, and ensures
conflict-free operation compared to other state-of-the-art planning methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种高效的层次化DDPG（HDDPG）算法，通过分层策略和改进的奖励函数解决了迷宫导航中的稀疏奖励和探索效率问题，显著提升了成功率和平均奖励。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准DDPG算法在迷宫导航中表现不佳，主要由于稀疏奖励、低效探索和长时程规划困难，导致低成功率和平均奖励。

Method: HDDPG采用分层策略，高层策略生成子目标，低层策略执行动作，并结合离策略校正、自适应参数空间噪声和优化奖励函数。

Result: 在ROS和Gazebo的实验中，HDDPG相比基线算法将成功率提高了至少56.59%，平均奖励提升了至少519.03。

Conclusion: HDDPG有效解决了迷宫导航中的挑战，显著优于标准DDPG及其变体。

Abstract: Maze navigation is a fundamental challenge in robotics, requiring agents to
traverse complex environments efficiently. While the Deep Deterministic Policy
Gradient (DDPG) algorithm excels in control tasks, its performance in maze
navigation suffers from sparse rewards, inefficient exploration, and
long-horizon planning difficulties, often leading to low success rates and
average rewards, sometimes even failing to achieve effective navigation. To
address these limitations, this paper proposes an efficient Hierarchical DDPG
(HDDPG) algorithm, which includes high-level and low-level policies. The
high-level policy employs an advanced DDPG framework to generate intermediate
subgoals from a long-term perspective and on a higher temporal scale. The
low-level policy, also powered by the improved DDPG algorithm, generates
primitive actions by observing current states and following the subgoal
assigned by the high-level policy. The proposed method enhances stability with
off-policy correction, refining subgoal assignments by relabeling historical
experiences. Additionally, adaptive parameter space noise is utilized to
improve exploration, and a reshaped intrinsic-extrinsic reward function is
employed to boost learning efficiency. Further optimizations, including
gradient clipping and Xavier initialization, are employed to improve
robustness. The proposed algorithm is rigorously evaluated through numerical
simulation experiments executed using the Robot Operating System (ROS) and
Gazebo. Regarding the three distinct final targets in autonomous maze
navigation tasks, HDDPG significantly overcomes the limitations of standard
DDPG and its variants, improving the success rate by at least 56.59% and
boosting the average reward by a minimum of 519.03 compared to baseline
algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能机器人在未知环境中仅依靠自然语言描述进行视觉导航是一个关键能力，现有方法通常被动依赖视觉输入，缺乏主动优化和记忆利用。

Method: 结合两种人类启发机制：基于视角的主动感知和历史记忆回溯，零样本方式运行，无需标注数据或模型微调。

Result: 在Habitat-Matterport 3D（HM3D）上表现优于现有方法，并在四足机器人上验证了实际部署的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该框架通过主动优化感知和记忆利用，显著提升了复杂环境中的视觉语言导航性能，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Visual navigation in unknown environments based solely on natural language
descriptions is a key capability for intelligent robots. In this work, we
propose a navigation framework built upon off-the-shelf Visual Language Models
(VLMs), enhanced with two human-inspired mechanisms: perspective-based active
grounding, which dynamically adjusts the robot's viewpoint for improved visual
inspection, and historical memory backtracking, which enables the system to
retain and re-evaluate uncertain observations over time. Unlike existing
approaches that passively rely on incidental visual inputs, our method actively
optimizes perception and leverages memory to resolve ambiguity, significantly
improving vision-language grounding in complex, unseen environments. Our
framework operates in a zero-shot manner, achieving strong generalization to
diverse and open-ended language descriptions without requiring labeled data or
model fine-tuning. Experimental results on Habitat-Matterport 3D (HM3D) show
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in language-driven
object navigation. We further demonstrate its practicality through real-world
deployment on a quadruped robot, achieving robust and effective navigation
performance.

Motivation: 多机械臂系统的高维度和潜在碰撞问题使得传统运动规划方法生成的路径在平滑性和执行时间上表现不佳，现有捷径优化方法缺乏详细描述和性能分析。

Method: 通过定量比较现有捷径优化方法，分析其优缺点，并提出两种简单策略以结合这些方法。

Result: 研究提供了对不同捷径优化方法的全面评估，并展示了新策略在性能与运行时间上的最佳平衡。

Conclusion: 本文为多机械臂运动规划中的捷径优化提供了详细分析和实用策略，有助于提升路径质量与效率。

Abstract: Generating high-quality motion plans for multiple robot arms is challenging
due to the high dimensionality of the system and the potential for inter-arm
collisions. Traditional motion planning methods often produce motions that are
suboptimal in terms of smoothness and execution time for multi-arm systems.
Post-processing via shortcutting is a common approach to improve motion quality
for efficient and smooth execution. However, in multi-arm scenarios, optimizing
one arm's motion must not introduce collisions with other arms. Although
existing multi-arm planning works often use some form of shortcutting
techniques, their exact methodology and impact on performance are often vaguely
described. In this work, we present a comprehensive study quantitatively
comparing existing shortcutting methods for multi-arm trajectories across
diverse simulated scenarios. We carefully analyze the pros and cons of each
shortcutting method and propose two simple strategies for combining these
methods to achieve the best performance-runtime tradeoff. Video, code, and
dataset are available at https://philip-huang.github.io/mr-shortcut/.

Abstract: External collisions to robot actuators typically pose risks to grasping
circular objects. This work presents a vision-based sensing module capable of
detecting collisions to maintain stable grasping with a soft gripper system.
The system employs an eye-in-palm camera with a broad field of view to
simultaneously monitor the motion of fingers and the grasped object.
Furthermore, we have developed a collision-rich grasping strategy to ensure the
stability and security of the entire dynamic grasping process. A physical soft
gripper was manufactured and affixed to a collaborative robotic arm to evaluate
the performance of the collision detection mechanism. An experiment regarding
testing the response time of the mechanism confirmed the system has the
capability to react to the collision instantaneously. A dodging test was
conducted to demonstrate the gripper can detect the direction and scale of
external collisions precisely.

investigates the legibility of humanoid robot arm movements in a pointing task,
aiming to understand how humans predict robot intentions from truncated

Abstract: Effective robotic systems for long-horizon human-robot collaboration must
adapt to a wide range of human partners, whose physical behavior, willingness
to assist, and understanding of the robot's capabilities may change over time.
This demands a tightly coupled communication loop that grants both agents the
flexibility to propose, accept, or decline requests as they coordinate toward
completing the task effectively. We apply a Mixed-Initiative dialog paradigm to
Collaborative human-roBot teaming and propose MICoBot, a system that handles
the common scenario where both agents, using natural language, take initiative
in formulating, accepting, or rejecting proposals on who can best complete
different steps of a task. To handle diverse, task-directed dialog, and find
successful collaborative strategies that minimize human effort, MICoBot makes
decisions at three levels: (1) a meta-planner considers human dialog to
formulate and code a high-level collaboration strategy, (2) a planner optimally
allocates the remaining steps to either agent based on the robot's capabilities
(measured by a simulation-pretrained affordance model) and the human's
estimated availability to help, and (3) an action executor decides the
low-level actions to perform or words to say to the human. Our extensive
evaluations in simulation and real-world -- on a physical robot with 18 unique
human participants over 27 hours -- demonstrate the ability of our method to
effectively collaborate with diverse human users, yielding significantly
improved task success and user experience than a pure LLM baseline and other
agent allocation models. See additional videos and materials at

Motivation: 自驱动实验室中机器人集成增加了安全复杂性，尤其是火灾和PPE合规性问题，需要高效的安全监控系统。

Method: 系统配备RGB、深度和红外摄像头，通过VLM驱动决策，实时监控危险并控制机器人远离危险区域。

Result: 在真实SDL环境中测试，危险检测和决策性能分别达到97%和95%。

Conclusion: Chemist Eye能有效提升SDL的安全性和响应速度，适合集成到现有实验室系统中。

Abstract: The integration of robotics and automation into self-driving laboratories
(SDLs) can introduce additional safety complexities, in addition to those that
already apply to conventional research laboratories. Personal protective
equipment (PPE) is an essential requirement for ensuring the safety and
well-being of workers in laboratories, self-driving or otherwise. Fires are
another important risk factor in chemical laboratories. In SDLs, fires that
occur close to mobile robots, which use flammable lithium batteries, could have
increased severity. Here, we present Chemist Eye, a distributed safety
monitoring system designed to enhance situational awareness in SDLs. The system
integrates multiple stations equipped with RGB, depth, and infrared cameras,
designed to monitor incidents in SDLs. Chemist Eye is also designed to spot
workers who have suffered a potential accident or medical emergency, PPE
compliance and fire hazards. To do this, Chemist Eye uses decision-making
driven by a vision-language model (VLM). Chemist Eye is designed for seamless
integration, enabling real-time communication with robots. Based on the VLM
recommendations, the system attempts to drive mobile robots away from potential
fire locations, exits, or individuals not wearing PPE, and issues audible
warnings where necessary. It also integrates with third-party messaging
platforms to provide instant notifications to lab personnel. We tested Chemist
Eye with real-world data from an SDL equipped with three mobile robots and
found that the spotting of possible safety hazards and decision-making
performances reached 97 % and 95 %, respectively.

Result: 在模拟实验中，FCBV-Net对未见过的服装仅效率下降11.5%，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 几何理解与动作价值学习的解耦提升了类别级泛化能力。

Abstract: Category-level generalization for robotic garment manipulation, such as
bimanual smoothing, remains a significant hurdle due to high dimensionality,
complex dynamics, and intra-category variations. Current approaches often
struggle, either overfitting with concurrently learned visual features for a
specific instance or, despite category-level perceptual generalization, failing
to predict the value of synergistic bimanual actions. We propose the
Feature-Conditioned Bimanual Value Network (FCBV-Net), operating on 3D point
clouds to specifically enhance category-level policy generalization for garment
smoothing. FCBV-Net conditions bimanual action value prediction on pre-trained,
frozen dense geometric features, ensuring robustness to intra-category garment
variations. Trainable downstream components then learn a task-specific policy
using these static features. In simulated GarmentLab experiments with the
CLOTH3D dataset, FCBV-Net demonstrated superior category-level generalization.
It exhibited only an 11.5% efficiency drop (Steps80) on unseen garments
compared to 96.2% for a 2D image-based baseline, and achieved 89% final
coverage, outperforming an 83% coverage from a 3D correspondence-based baseline
that uses identical per-point geometric features but a fixed primitive. These
results highlight that the decoupling of geometric understanding from bimanual
action value learning enables better category-level generalization.

Abstract: Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models for multi-task robotic
manipulation commonly rely on static viewpoints and shared visual encoders,
which limit 3D perception and cause task interference, hindering robustness and
generalization. In this work, we propose Task-Aware View Planning (TAVP), a
framework designed to overcome these challenges by integrating active view
planning with task-specific representation learning. TAVP employs an efficient
exploration policy, accelerated by a novel pseudo-environment, to actively
acquire informative views. Furthermore, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
visual encoder to disentangle features across different tasks, boosting both
representation fidelity and task generalization. By learning to see the world

Motivation: 研究儿童与机器人NED在艺术表演中的互动体验，探索如何提升人机交互的吸引力和意义。

Method: 通过观察分析18名儿童与NED的互动，总结设计特点和行为模式。

Result: 发现三大挑战：互动持续性、机器人表现力和期望未满足；儿童对机器人表现出好奇和适应能力。

Conclusion: 需优化人机交互系统，考虑观众能力和期望，以提升儿童在艺术表演中的体验。

Abstract: This paper presents an evaluation of 18 children's in-the-wild experiences
with the autonomous robot arm performer NED (Never-Ending Dancer) within the
Thingamabobas installation, showcased across the UK. We detail NED's design,
including costume, behaviour, and human interactions, all integral to the
installation. Our observational analysis revealed three key challenges in
child-robot interactions: 1) Initiating and maintaining engagement, 2) Lack of
robot expressivity and reciprocity, and 3) Unmet expectations. Our findings
show that children are naturally curious, and adept at interacting with a
robotic art performer. However, our observations emphasise the critical need to
optimise human-robot interaction (HRI) systems through careful consideration of
audience's capabilities, perceptions, and expectations, within the performative
arts context, to enable engaging and meaningful experiences, especially for
young audiences.

Abstract: Foundation models, including large language models (LLMs) and vision-language
models (VLMs), have recently enabled novel approaches to robot autonomy and
human-robot interfaces. In parallel, vision-language-action models (VLAs) or
large behavior models (BLMs) are increasing the dexterity and capabilities of
robotic systems. This survey paper focuses on those words advancing towards
agentic applications and architectures. This includes initial efforts exploring
GPT-style interfaces to tooling, as well as more complex system where AI agents
are coordinators, planners, perception actors, or generalist interfaces. Such
agentic architectures allow robots to reason over natural language
instructions, invoke APIs, plan task sequences, or assist in operations and
diagnostics. In addition to peer-reviewed research, due to the fast-evolving
nature of the field, we highlight and include community-driven projects, ROS
packages, and industrial frameworks that show emerging trends. We propose a
taxonomy for classifying model integration approaches and present a comparative
analysis of the role that agents play in different solutions in today's
literature.

TL;DR: GhostShell利用LLM实现实时行为编程，通过流式XML解析和动态接口映射，显著提升机器人行为正确性和响应速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统预编程方法灵活性不足，GhostShell旨在通过LLM实现实时、并发的行为编程。

Method: 采用流式XML函数标记解析器、动态函数接口映射器和多通道调度器，协调串并行机器人动作。

Result: 在34个实际任务中，GhostShell行为正确性达0.85，响应速度提升66倍，且在多模态任务中表现稳健。

Conclusion: GhostShell为机器人行为编程提供了高效、灵活的新方法，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: We present GhostShell, a novel approach that leverages Large Language Models
(LLMs) to enable streaming and concurrent behavioral programming for embodied
systems. In contrast to conventional methods that rely on pre-scheduled action
sequences or behavior trees, GhostShell drives embodied systems to act
on-the-fly by issuing function calls incrementally as tokens are streamed from
the LLM. GhostShell features a streaming XML function token parser, a dynamic
function interface mapper, and a multi-channel scheduler that orchestrates
intra-channel synchronous and inter-channel asynchronous function calls,
thereby coordinating serial-parallel embodied actions across multiple robotic
components as directed by the LLM. We evaluate GhostShell on our robot
prototype COCO through comprehensive grounded experiments across 34 real-world
interaction tasks and multiple LLMs. The results demonstrate that our approach
achieves state-of-the-art Behavioral Correctness Metric of 0.85 with Claude-4
Sonnet and up to 66X faster response times compared to LLM native function
calling APIs. GhostShell also proves effective in long-horizon multimodal
tasks, demonstrating strong robustness and generalization.

TL;DR: GF-VLA框架通过信息论和语言条件转换器，使双臂机器人直接从人类演示中学习任务级推理和执行，表现出高准确性和泛化能力。


<details>

Motivation: 解决传统低级别轨迹模仿在跨对象类型、空间布局和操纵器配置中泛化能力不足的问题。

Method: 提取任务相关的手和对象信息，编码为时序场景图，结合语言条件转换器生成行为树和运动指令，并引入跨手选择策略优化执行效率。

Conclusion: GF-VLA框架在任务级推理和执行上表现出高效性和鲁棒性，适用于复杂场景。

Abstract: Teaching robots dexterous skills from human videos remains challenging due to
the reliance on low-level trajectory imitation, which fails to generalize
across object types, spatial layouts, and manipulator configurations. We
propose Graph-Fused Vision-Language-Action (GF-VLA), a framework that enables
dual-arm robotic systems to perform task-level reasoning and execution directly
from RGB and Depth human demonstrations. GF-VLA first extracts
Shannon-information-based cues to identify hands and objects with the highest
task relevance, then encodes these cues into temporally ordered scene graphs
that capture both hand-object and object-object interactions. These graphs are
fused with a language-conditioned transformer that generates hierarchical
behavior trees and interpretable Cartesian motion commands. To improve
execution efficiency in bimanual settings, we further introduce a cross-hand
selection policy that infers optimal gripper assignment without explicit
geometric reasoning. We evaluate GF-VLA on four structured dual-arm block
assembly tasks involving symbolic shape construction and spatial
generalization. Experimental results show that the information-theoretic scene
representation achieves over 95 percent graph accuracy and 93 percent subtask
segmentation, supporting the LLM planner in generating reliable and
human-readable task policies. When executed by the dual-arm robot, these
policies yield 94 percent grasp success, 89 percent placement accuracy, and 90
percent overall task success across stacking, letter-building, and geometric
reconfiguration scenarios, demonstrating strong generalization and robustness
across diverse spatial and semantic variations.

Method: 框架分为两部分：上下文表示和行为优先级学习，通过聚类物理上下文并优化行为优先级。

Result: 在72次交互中训练，机器人能自主学习和泛化行为优先级，适应未访问的物理上下文。

Conclusion: Affecta-context框架有效提升了社交机器人在不同环境中的行为适应能力。

Abstract: This paper presents Affecta-context, a general framework to facilitate
behavior adaptation for social robots. The framework uses information about the
physical context to guide its behaviors in human-robot interactions. It
consists of two parts: one that represents encountered contexts and one that
learns to prioritize between behaviors through human-robot interactions. As
physical contexts are encountered the framework clusters them by their measured
physical properties. In each context, the framework learns to prioritize
between behaviors to optimize the physical attributes of the robot's behavior
in line with its current environment and the preferences of the users it
interacts with. This paper illlustrates the abilities of the Affecta-context
framework by enabling a robot to autonomously learn the prioritization of
discrete behaviors. This was achieved by training across 72 interactions in two
different physical contexts with 6 different human test participants. The paper
demonstrates the trained Affecta-context framework by verifying the robot's
ability to generalize over the input and to match its behaviors to a previously
unvisited physical context.

Result: 仿真和实际实验表明，该方法在效率和精度上优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的姿态估计方法显著提升了GVIO系统的性能，适用于多传感器融合场景。

Abstract: Invariant Extended Kalman Filter (IEKF) has been a significant technique in
vision-aided sensor fusion. However, it usually suffers from high computational
burden when jointly optimizing camera poses and the landmarks. To improve its
efficiency and applicability for multi-sensor fusion, we present a multi-view
pose-only estimation approach with its application to GNSS-Visual-Inertial
Odometry (GVIO) in this paper. Our main contribution is deriving a visual
measurement model which directly associates landmark representation with
multiple camera poses and observations. Such a pose-only measurement is proven
to be tightly-coupled between landmarks and poses, and maintain a perfect null
space that is independent of estimated poses. Finally, we apply the proposed
approach to a filter based GVIO with a novel feature management strategy. Both
simulation tests and real-world experiments are conducted to demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method in terms of efficiency and accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解机器人如何通过情感表达缓解人类对其的敌意，尤其是在机器人表现不佳时。

Method: 使用定制的情感机器人在模拟冲突场景中测试105名参与者，评估五种表达方式的效果。

Result: 所有表达方式均能成功缓解冲突，运动方式表现显著不同，参与者对各方式的情感解读相似。

Conclusion: 缓解高强度互动可能更需机器人具备社会情境意识，而非特定表达能力。

Abstract: This paper investigates the specific scenario of high-intensity
confrontations between humans and robots, to understand how robots can defuse
the conflict. It focuses on the effectiveness of using five different affective
expression modalities as main drivers for defusing the conflict. The aim is to
discover any strengths or weaknesses in using each modality to mitigate the
hostility that people feel towards a poorly performing robot. The defusing of
the situation is accomplished by making the robot better at acknowledging the
conflict and by letting it express remorse. To facilitate the tests, we used a
custom affective robot in a simulated conflict situation with 105 test
participants. The results show that all tested expression modalities can
successfully be used to defuse the situation and convey an acknowledgment of
the confrontation. The ratings were remarkably similar, but the movement
modality was different (ANON p$<$.05) than the other modalities. The test
participants also had similar affective interpretations on how impacted the
robot was of the confrontation across all expression modalities. This indicates
that defusing a high-intensity interaction may not demand special attention to
the expression abilities of the robot, but rather require attention to the
abilities of being socially aware of the situation and reacting in accordance
with it.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于实时迭代方案的新方法，显著降低了扩散策略的推理时间，无需额外训练或策略重新设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散策略在机器人操作任务中表现优异，但其推理时间长且需要连续执行动作块，限制了其在延迟敏感任务中的应用。

Method: 借鉴最优控制中的实时迭代方案，利用前一时间步的解作为后续迭代的初始猜测，并提出基于缩放的方法处理离散动作。

Result: 实验显示推理时间大幅减少，性能与完整步去噪的扩散策略相当。

Conclusion: 该方法可无缝集成到预训练的扩散模型中，尤其适用于资源需求大的模型。

Abstract: Diffusion Policies have demonstrated impressive performance in robotic
manipulation tasks. However, their long inference time, resulting from an
extensive iterative denoising process, and the need to execute an action chunk
before the next prediction to maintain consistent actions limit their
applicability to latency-critical tasks or simple tasks with a short cycle
time. While recent methods explored distillation or alternative policy
structures to accelerate inference, these often demand additional training,
which can be resource-intensive for large robotic models. In this paper, we
introduce a novel approach inspired by the Real-Time Iteration (RTI) Scheme, a
method from optimal control that accelerates optimization by leveraging
solutions from previous time steps as initial guesses for subsequent
iterations. We explore the application of this scheme in diffusion inference
and propose a scaling-based method to effectively handle discrete actions, such
as grasping, in robotic manipulation. The proposed scheme significantly reduces
runtime computational costs without the need for distillation or policy
redesign. This enables a seamless integration into many pre-trained
diffusion-based models, in particular, to resource-demanding large models. We
also provide theoretical conditions for the contractivity which could be useful
for estimating the initial denoising step. Quantitative results from extensive
simulation experiments show a substantial reduction in inference time, with
comparable overall performance compared with Diffusion Policy using full-step
denoising. Our project page with additional resources is available at:

Conclusion: DistillDrive通过知识蒸馏和多样化实例模仿，显著提升了自动驾驶的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has been recently seen rapid development,
exerting a profound influence on both industry and academia. However, the
existing work places excessive focus on ego-vehicle status as their sole
learning objectives and lacks of planning-oriented understanding, which limits
the robustness of the overall decision-making prcocess. In this work, we
introduce DistillDrive, an end-to-end knowledge distillation-based autonomous
driving model that leverages diversified instance imitation to enhance
multi-mode motion feature learning. Specifically, we employ a planning model
based on structured scene representations as the teacher model, leveraging its
diversified planning instances as multi-objective learning targets for the
end-to-end model. Moreover, we incorporate reinforcement learning to enhance
the optimization of state-to-decision mappings, while utilizing generative
modeling to construct planning-oriented instances, fostering intricate
interactions within the latent space. We validate our model on the nuScenes and
NAVSIM datasets, achieving a 50\% reduction in collision rate and a 3-point
improvement in closed-loop performance compared to the baseline model. Code and
model are publicly available at https://github.com/YuruiAI/DistillDrive

Conclusion: 该系统结合模块化材料、分布式控制和计算设计，推动了仿生机器人技术的发展。

Abstract: Natural organisms use distributed actuation via their musculoskeletal systems
to adapt their gait for traversing diverse terrains or to morph their bodies to
perform varied tasks. A longstanding challenge in the field of robotics is to
mimic this extensive adaptability and range of motion. This has led humans to
develop various soft robotic systems that emulate natural organisms. However,
such systems are generally optimized for a single functionality, lack the
ability to change form or function on demand, or are often tethered to bulky
control systems. To address these challenges, we present our framework for
designing and controlling robots that mimic nature's blueprint by utilizing
distributed actuation. We propose a novel building block that combines
3D-printed bones with liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) muscles as lightweight
actuators and enables the modular assembly of musculoskeletal robots. We
developed LCE rods that contract in response to infrared radiation, thereby
achieving local and untethered control over the distributed network of bones,
which in turn results in global deformation of the robot. Furthermore, to
capitalize on the extensive design space, we develop two computational tools:
one to optimize the robot's skeletal graph, enabling multiple target
deformations, and another to co-optimize the skeletal designs and control gaits
to achieve target locomotion. We validate our system by building several robots
that show complex shape morphing, varying control schemes, and adaptability to
their environment. Our system integrates advances in modular material building,
untethered and distributed control, and computational design to introduce a new
generation of robots that brings us closer to the capabilities of living
organisms.

Method: 通过比较人类手与商用机器人手及假肢手的性能，系统回顾其机制与技能。

Result: 发现手腕灵活性和手指外展/内收对灵巧性更重要，而增加手指数量或自由度并非必要。三指设计是简单性与灵巧性的良好折衷。

Conclusion: 人类手并非机器人手的唯一理想目标，非拟人化设计可能更高效。

Abstract: Human manipulation skills represent a pinnacle of their voluntary motor
functions, requiring the coordination of many degrees of freedom and processing
of high-dimensional sensor input to achieve such a high level of dexterity.
Thus, we set out to answer whether the human hand, with its associated
biomechanical properties, sensors, and control mechanisms, is an ideal that we
should strive for in robotics-do we really need anthropomorphic robotic hands?
  This survey can help practitioners to make the trade-off between hand
complexity and potential manipulation skills. We provide an overview of the
human hand, a comparison of commercially available robotic and prosthetic
hands, and a systematic review of hand mechanisms and skills that they are
capable of. This leads to follow-up questions. What is the minimum requirement
for mechanisms and sensors to implement most skills that a robot needs? What is
missing to reach human-level dexterity? Can we improve upon human dexterity?
  Although complex five-fingered hands are often used as the ultimate goal for
robotic manipulators, they are not necessary for all tasks. We found that wrist
flexibility and finger abduction/adduction are important for manipulation
capabilities. On the contrary, increasing the number of fingers, actuators, or
degrees of freedom is often not necessary. Three fingers are a good compromise
between simplicity and dexterity. Non-anthropomorphic hand designs with two
opposing pairs of fingers or human hands with six fingers can further increase
dexterity, suggesting that the human hand may not be the optimum.

Abstract: Embodied AI benchmarks have advanced navigation, manipulation, and reasoning,
but most target complex humanoid agents or large-scale simulations that are far
from real-world deployment. In contrast, mobile cleaning robots with dual mode
capabilities, such as sweeping and grasping, are rapidly emerging as realistic
and commercially viable platforms. However, no benchmark currently exists that
systematically evaluates these agents in structured, multi-target cleaning
tasks, revealing a critical gap between academic research and real-world
applications. We introduce CleanUpBench, a reproducible and extensible
benchmark for evaluating embodied agents in realistic indoor cleaning
scenarios. Built on NVIDIA Isaac Sim, CleanUpBench simulates a mobile service
robot equipped with a sweeping mechanism and a six-degree-of-freedom robotic
arm, enabling interaction with heterogeneous objects. The benchmark includes
manually designed environments and one procedurally generated layout to assess
generalization, along with a comprehensive evaluation suite covering task
completion, spatial efficiency, motion quality, and control performance. To
support comparative studies, we provide baseline agents based on heuristic
strategies and map-based planning. CleanUpBench bridges the gap between
low-level skill evaluation and full-scene testing, offering a scalable testbed
for grounded, embodied intelligence in everyday settings.

Abstract: Mobile robots navigating in crowds trained using reinforcement learning are
known to suffer performance degradation when faced with out-of-distribution
scenarios. We propose that by properly accounting for the uncertainties of
pedestrians, a robot can learn safe navigation policies that are robust to
distribution shifts. Our method augments agent observations with prediction
uncertainty estimates generated by adaptive conformal inference, and it uses
these estimates to guide the agent's behavior through constrained reinforcement
learning. The system helps regulate the agent's actions and enables it to adapt
to distribution shifts. In the in-distribution setting, our approach achieves a
96.93% success rate, which is over 8.80% higher than the previous
state-of-the-art baselines with over 3.72 times fewer collisions and 2.43 times
fewer intrusions into ground-truth human future trajectories. In three
out-of-distribution scenarios, our method shows much stronger robustness when
facing distribution shifts in velocity variations, policy changes, and
transitions from individual to group dynamics. We deploy our method on a real
robot, and experiments show that the robot makes safe and robust decisions when
interacting with both sparse and dense crowds. Our code and videos are

TL;DR: 介绍了一种低延迟的电信AI语音代理管道，用于实时交互式通信，结合了四个专用模型，实现了高响应性的语音AI代理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为电信行业提供先进的语音AI解决方案，支持自动化客户服务、智能IVR和AI驱动的客户支持。

Method: 结合了四个专用模型（TSLAM、T-VEC、TTE、T-Synth），通过流式ASR、对话智能、检索增强生成和实时TTS实现低延迟语音交互。

Result: 系统在500条电信问题数据集上测试，显示TSLAM、TTE和T-Synth的实时因子低于1.0，适合企业级低延迟部署。

Conclusion: 该管道为下一代电信AI奠定了基础，支持自动化客户支持和诊断等功能。

Abstract: We introduce a low-latency telecom AI voice agent pipeline for real-time,
interactive telecommunications use, enabling advanced voice AI for call center
automation, intelligent IVR (Interactive Voice Response), and AI-driven
customer support. The solution is built for telecom, combining four specialized
models by NetoAI: TSLAM, a 4-bit quantized Telecom-Specific Large Language
Model (LLM); T-VEC, a Telecom-Specific Embedding Model; TTE, a Telecom-Specific
Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model; and T-Synth, a Telecom-Specific
Text-to-Speech (TTS) model. These models enable highly responsive,
domain-adapted voice AI agents supporting knowledge-grounded spoken
interactions with low latency. The pipeline integrates streaming ASR (TTE),
conversational intelligence (TSLAM), retrieval augmented generation (RAG) over
telecom documents, and real-time TTS (T-Synth), setting a new benchmark for
telecom voice assistants. To evaluate the system, we built a dataset of 500
human-recorded telecom questions from RFCs, simulating real telecom agent
queries. This framework allows analysis of latency, domain relevance, and
real-time performance across the stack. Results show that TSLAM, TTE, and
T-Synth deliver real-time factors (RTF) below 1.0, supporting enterprise,
low-latency telecom deployments. These AI agents -- powered by TSLAM, TTE, and
T-Synth -- provide a foundation for next-generation telecom AI, enabling
automated customer support, diagnostics, and more.

TL;DR: MEEtBrain是一个便携式多模态框架，通过AI生成音乐刺激和无线头带同步采集EEG-fNIRS数据，解决了现有音乐情感计算中的刺激限制、模态单一性和便携性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音乐情感计算在心理健康领域具有重要意义，但现有研究存在刺激限制、模态单一性和便携性不足的问题。

Method: 提出MEEtBrain框架，结合AI生成音乐刺激和便携式无线头带同步采集EEG-fNIRS数据。

Result: 通过20名参与者的14小时数据集验证了框架的有效性，并正在扩展数据集（44名参与者）以供公开使用。

Conclusion: MEEtBrain为音乐情感计算提供了更高效、便携和多模态的解决方案，推动了相关研究和实际应用。

Abstract: Emotions critically influence mental health, driving interest in music-based
affective computing via neurophysiological signals with Brain-computer
Interface techniques. While prior studies leverage music's accessibility for
emotion induction, three key limitations persist: \textbf{(1) Stimulus
Constraints}: Music stimuli are confined to small corpora due to copyright and
curation costs, with selection biases from heuristic emotion-music mappings
that ignore individual affective profiles. \textbf{(2) Modality Specificity}:
Overreliance on unimodal neural data (e.g., EEG) ignores complementary insights
from cross-modal signal fusion.\textbf{ (3) Portability Limitation}: Cumbersome
setups (e.g., 64+ channel gel-based EEG caps) hinder real-world applicability
due to procedural complexity and portability barriers. To address these
limitations, we propose MEEtBrain, a portable and multimodal framework for
emotion analysis (valence/arousal), integrating AI-generated music stimuli with
synchronized EEG-fNIRS acquisition via a wireless headband. By MEEtBrain, the
music stimuli can be automatically generated by AI on a large scale,
eliminating subjective selection biases while ensuring music diversity. We use
our developed portable device that is designed in a lightweight headband-style
and uses dry electrodes, to simultaneously collect EEG and fNIRS recordings. A
14-hour dataset from 20 participants was collected in the first recruitment to
validate the framework's efficacy, with AI-generated music eliciting target
emotions (valence/arousal). We are actively expanding our multimodal dataset
(44 participants in the latest dataset) and make it publicly available to
promote further research and practical applications. \textbf{The dataset is
available at https://zju-bmi-lab.github.io/ZBra.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于强化学习的框架，通过偏好优化控制歌词到歌曲生成中的幻觉问题，显著减少了音素错误率（PER）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频生成模型在歌词到歌曲生成中常出现幻觉问题，导致输出与歌词不匹配，影响音乐连贯性。传统监督微调方法效果有限。

Method: 构建了幻觉偏好数据集，并采用三种强化学习策略（DPO、PPO、GRPO）进行优化，分别通过离策略和策略方法减少PER。

Result: DPO、PPO和GRPO分别实现了7.4%、4.9%和4.7%的PER降低，有效抑制幻觉同时保持音乐质量。

Conclusion: 该框架为歌词到歌曲生成中的幻觉控制提供了系统性解决方案，并具有扩展到音乐风格和音乐性增强的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in audio-based generative language models have accelerated
AI-driven lyric-to-song generation. However, these models frequently suffer
from content hallucination, producing outputs misaligned with the input lyrics
and undermining musical coherence. Current supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
approaches, limited by passive label-fitting, exhibit constrained
self-improvement and poor hallucination mitigation. To address this core
challenge, we propose a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework leveraging
preference optimization for hallucination control. Our key contributions
include: (1) Developing a robust hallucination preference dataset constructed
via phoneme error rate (PER) computation and rule-based filtering to capture
alignment with human expectations; (2) Implementing and evaluating three
distinct preference optimization strategies within the RL framework: Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). DPO operates off-policy to enhance
positive token likelihood, achieving a significant 7.4% PER reduction. PPO and
GRPO employ an on-policy approach, training a PER-based reward model to
iteratively optimize sequences via reward maximization and KL-regularization,
yielding PER reductions of 4.9% and 4.7%, respectively. Comprehensive objective
and subjective evaluations confirm that our methods effectively suppress
hallucinations while preserving musical quality. Crucially, this work presents
a systematic, RL-based solution to hallucination control in lyric-to-song
generation. The framework's transferability also unlocks potential for music
style adherence and musicality enhancement, opening new avenues for future
generative song research.

Motivation: 扩展SoundStream的能力，支持更高采样率和多通道音频，提升音频质量。

Method: 采用时频域音频表示的新神经架构，并使用延迟融合策略处理多通道音频。

Result: 在48 kHz立体声音乐中实现高质量重建，比特率低至4-16 kbps。

Conclusion: SpectroStream在更高采样率和多通道音频中表现出色，平衡了音质和相位一致性。

Abstract: We propose SpectroStream, a full-band multi-channel neural audio codec.
Successor to the well-established SoundStream, SpectroStream extends its
capability beyond 24 kHz monophonic audio and enables high-quality
reconstruction of 48 kHz stereo music at bit rates of 4--16 kbps. This is
accomplished with a new neural architecture that leverages audio representation
in the time-frequency domain, which leads to better audio quality especially at
higher sample rate. The model also uses a delayed-fusion strategy to handle
multi-channel audio, which is crucial in balancing per-channel acoustic quality
and cross-channel phase consistency.

*Mathias Rose Bjare,Stefan Lattner,Gerhard Widmer*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 研究探讨了使用自回归扩散模型（ADMs）计算信息内容（IC）对音乐期望和惊讶建模的有效性，发现其优于生成无限词汇变换器（GIVT）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索扩散模型在音乐和音频特征建模中的潜力，尤其是其在捕捉惊讶方面的表现。

Method: 通过两种不同的扩散常微分方程（ODEs）计算IC，并在单音高惊讶和多轨音频分段边界检测任务中评估其性能。

Result: 扩散模型在两项任务中表现优于或等同于GIVT，且适当噪声水平下任务结果有所提升。

Conclusion: 扩散模型在不同噪声水平下捕捉音乐和音频特征的惊讶表现优异，验证了其假设。

Abstract: Recently, the information content (IC) of predictions from a Generative
Infinite-Vocabulary Transformer (GIVT) has been used to model musical
expectancy and surprisal in audio. We investigate the effectiveness of such
modelling using IC calculated with autoregressive diffusion models (ADMs). We
empirically show that IC estimates of models based on two different diffusion
ordinary differential equations (ODEs) describe diverse data better, in terms
of negative log-likelihood, than a GIVT. We evaluate diffusion model IC's
effectiveness in capturing surprisal aspects by examining two tasks: (1)
capturing monophonic pitch surprisal, and (2) detecting segment boundaries in
multi-track audio. In both tasks, the diffusion models match or exceed the
performance of a GIVT. We hypothesize that the surprisal estimated at different
diffusion process noise levels corresponds to the surprisal of music and audio
features present at different audio granularities. Testing our hypothesis, we
find that, for appropriate noise levels, the studied musical surprisal tasks'
results improve. Code is provided on github.com/SonyCSLParis/audioic.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了NonVerbalSpeech-38K数据集，用于非语言语音生成和理解，包含38,718个样本，验证了其在语音合成和标注任务中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音系统主要关注语言内容，忽略了非语言声音（如笑声、叹息）的情感和社会信号，导致交互缺乏情感智能和丰富性。

Method: 通过自动标注管道从真实媒体中收集并构建了包含10类非语言声音的大规模数据集NonVerbalSpeech-38K，并利用F5-TTS和Qwen2-Audio等模型验证其有效性。

Result: 数据集在非语言语音生成和理解任务中表现良好，提升了语音合成和标注的效果。

Conclusion: 该数据集为丰富人机交互提供了实用工具，推动了非语言语音研究的发展。

Abstract: Human spoken communication involves not only lexical content but also
non-verbal vocalizations (NVs) such as laughter, sighs, and coughs, which
convey emotions, intentions, and social signals. However, most existing speech
systems focus solely on verbal content and lack the ability to understand and
generate such non-verbal cues, reducing the emotional intelligence and
communicative richness of spoken interfaces. In this work, we introduce
$\textbf{NonVerbalSpeech-38K}$, a large and diverse dataset for non-verbal
speech generation and understanding, collected from real-world media and
annotated using an automatic pipeline. The dataset contains 38,718 samples
(about 131 hours) with 10 categories of non-verbal cues, such as laughter,
sniff, and throat clearing. We further validate the dataset by fine-tuning
state-of-the-art models, including F5-TTS and Qwen2-Audio, demonstrating its
effectiveness in non-verbal speech generation and understanding tasks. Our
contributions are threefold: (1) We propose a practical pipeline for building
natural and diverse non-verbal speech datasets; (2) We release a large-scale
dataset to advance research on non-verbal speech generation and understanding;
(3) We validate the dataset's effectiveness by demonstrating improvements in
both non-verbal speech synthesis and captioning, thereby facilitating richer
human-computer interaction.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于图匹配的GPU集群调度策略Tesserae，显著提升了资源利用率和作业完成时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型训练成为数据中心主要负载，现有调度策略存在性能不足或扩展性差的问题。

Method: 将调度约束建模为图匹配问题，设计新策略以减少作业迁移开销和优化资源打包。

Result: Tesserae将平均作业完成时间提升1.62倍，整体完成时间提升1.15倍。

Conclusion: 图匹配方法为GPU集群调度提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Training deep learning (DL) models has become a dominant workload in
data-centers and improving resource utilization is a key goal of DL cluster
schedulers. In order to do this, schedulers typically incorporate placement
policies that govern where jobs are placed on the cluster. Existing placement
policies are either designed as ad-hoc heuristics or incorporated as
constraints within a complex optimization problem and thus either suffer from
suboptimal performance or poor scalability. Our key insight is that many
placement constraints can be formulated as graph matching problems and based on
that we design novel placement policies for minimizing job migration overheads
and job packing. We integrate these policies into Tesserae and describe how our
design leads to a scalable and effective GPU cluster scheduler. Our
experimental results show that Tesserae improves average JCT by up to 1.62x and
the Makespan by up to 1.15x compared with the existing schedulers.

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一个全面的评估框架，用于比较不同CNN架构在乳腺X线图像检索任务中的表现，通过高级训练策略和严格的数据验证，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的医学图像检索研究存在样本量不足、数据分割不当和统计验证不足等问题，限制了临床转化。

Method: 研究比较了DenseNet121、ResNet50和VGG16等CNN架构，采用精细调优、度量学习和超级集成优化等策略，并使用分层数据分割和bootstrap置信区间进行验证。

Result: 高级调优和超级集成优化显著提升了性能，DenseNet121和ResNet50的precision@10分别提高了19.64%和19.58%，超级集成优化达到36.33% precision@10。

Conclusion: 该框架为临床部署提供了性能基准和架构选择指南，显著超越了现有文献中的预期性能。

Abstract: Content-based mammographic image retrieval systems require exact BIRADS
categorical matching across five distinct classes, presenting significantly
greater complexity than binary classification tasks commonly addressed in
literature. Current medical image retrieval studies suffer from methodological
limitations including inadequate sample sizes, improper data splitting, and
insufficient statistical validation that hinder clinical translation. We
developed a comprehensive evaluation framework systematically comparing CNN
architectures (DenseNet121, ResNet50, VGG16) with advanced training strategies
including sophisticated fine-tuning, metric learning, and super-ensemble
optimization. Our evaluation employed rigorous stratified data splitting
(50%/20%/30% train/validation/test), 602 test queries, and systematic
validation using bootstrap confidence intervals with 1,000 samples. Advanced
fine-tuning with differential learning rates achieved substantial improvements:
DenseNet121 (34.79% precision@10, 19.64% improvement) and ResNet50 (34.54%,
19.58% improvement). Super-ensemble optimization combining complementary
architectures achieved 36.33% precision@10 (95% CI: [34.78%, 37.88%]),
representing 24.93% improvement over baseline and providing 3.6 relevant cases
per query. Statistical analysis revealed significant performance differences
between optimization strategies (p<0.001) with large effect sizes (Cohen's
d>0.8), while maintaining practical search efficiency (2.8milliseconds).
Performance significantly exceeds realistic expectations for 5-class medical
retrieval tasks, where literature suggests 20-25% precision@10 represents
achievable performance for exact BIRADS matching. Our framework establishes new
performance benchmarks while providing evidence-based architecture selection
guidelines for clinical deployment in diagnostic support and quality assurance
applications.

### [314] [CryoGS: Gaussian Splatting for Cryo-EM Homogeneous Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04929)
*Suyi Chen,Haibin Ling*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为cryoGS的新方法，利用高斯混合模型（GMM）和物理启发的技术，直接从原始冷冻电镜图像中重建分子结构，无需依赖外部初始化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冷冻电镜（cryo-EM）是结构生物学的重要工具，但其核心计算任务——从噪声2D投影重建3D分子结构——依赖外部初始化，限制了独立管道的应用。

Method: cryoGS结合高斯喷射（Gaussian splatting）和冷冻电镜成像物理，开发了正交投影感知的高斯喷射技术，包括归一化项和FFT对齐坐标系等创新。

Result: 实验验证了cryoGS在真实数据集上的有效性和鲁棒性，优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: cryoGS为冷冻电镜重建提供了一种稳定且高效的自包含解决方案，代码将在发表后开源。

Abstract: As a critical modality for structural biology, cryogenic electron microscopy
(cryo-EM) facilitates the determination of macromolecular structures at
near-atomic resolution. The core computational task in single-particle cryo-EM
is to reconstruct the 3D electrostatic potential of a molecule from a large
collection of noisy 2D projections acquired at unknown orientations. Gaussian
mixture models (GMMs) provide a continuous, compact, and physically
interpretable representation for molecular density and have recently gained
interest in cryo-EM reconstruction. However, existing methods rely on external
consensus maps or atomic models for initialization, limiting their use in
self-contained pipelines. Addressing this issue, we introduce cryoGS, a
GMM-based method that integrates Gaussian splatting with the physics of cryo-EM
image formation. In particular, we develop an orthogonal projection-aware
Gaussian splatting, with adaptations such as a normalization term and
FFT-aligned coordinate system tailored for cryo-EM imaging. All these
innovations enable stable and efficient homogeneous reconstruction directly
from raw cryo-EM particle images using random initialization. Experimental
results on real datasets validate the effectiveness and robustness of cryoGS
over representative baselines. The code will be released upon publication.

TL;DR: 该论文提出使用隐式神经表示（INRs）进行医学图像质量评估，解决了传统方法因预处理导致信息丢失和高内存需求的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像中的伪影影响诊断准确性，传统基于图像的方法因预处理导致信息丢失和高内存需求，限制了分类模型的可扩展性。

Method: 采用隐式神经表示（INRs）提供紧凑连续的医学图像表示，结合深度权重空间网络、图神经网络和关系注意力变换器进行图像质量评估。

Result: 在ACDC数据集上评估，该方法在减少参数的同时实现了与现有方法相似的性能。

Conclusion: INRs为医学图像质量评估提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Artifacts pose a significant challenge in medical imaging, impacting
diagnostic accuracy and downstream analysis. While image-based approaches for
detecting artifacts can be effective, they often rely on preprocessing methods
that can lead to information loss and high-memory-demand medical images,
thereby limiting the scalability of classification models. In this work, we
propose the use of implicit neural representations (INRs) for image quality
assessment. INRs provide a compact and continuous representation of medical
images, naturally handling variations in resolution and image size while
reducing memory overhead. We develop deep weight space networks, graph neural
networks, and relational attention transformers that operate on INRs to achieve
image quality assessment. Our method is evaluated on the ACDC dataset with
synthetically generated artifact patterns, demonstrating its effectiveness in
assessing image quality while achieving similar performance with fewer
parameters.

TL;DR: AI模型在区分Spitz肿瘤与常规黑色素瘤方面表现优异（AUROC 0.95，准确率0.86），在预测基因异常和诊断类别上优于随机猜测，且优于病理学家。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Spitz肿瘤与常规黑色素瘤在组织学特征上的重叠问题，提高诊断准确性。

Method: 使用包含393例Spitz肿瘤和379例常规黑色素瘤的数据集，开发并验证AI模型，比较其与四位病理学家的表现。

Result: AI模型在区分任务中表现最佳（AUROC 0.95），基因异常和诊断类别预测准确率分别为0.55和0.51，优于随机猜测和病理学家。

Conclusion: AI模型在诊断Spitz肿瘤方面具有潜力，可降低成本和时间，但需进一步验证。

Abstract: Spitz tumors are diagnostically challenging due to overlap in atypical
histological features with conventional melanomas. We investigated to what
extent AI models, using histological and/or clinical features, can: (1)
distinguish Spitz tumors from conventional melanomas; (2) predict the
underlying genetic aberration of Spitz tumors; and (3) predict the diagnostic
category of Spitz tumors. The AI models were developed and validated using a
dataset of 393 Spitz tumors and 379 conventional melanomas. Predictive
performance was measured using the AUROC and the accuracy. The performance of
the AI models was compared with that of four experienced pathologists in a
reader study. Moreover, a simulation experiment was conducted to investigate
the impact of implementing AI-based recommendations for ancillary diagnostic
testing on the workflow of the pathology department. The best AI model based on
UNI features reached an AUROC of 0.95 and an accuracy of 0.86 in
differentiating Spitz tumors from conventional melanomas. The genetic
aberration was predicted with an accuracy of 0.55 compared to 0.25 for randomly
guessing. The diagnostic category was predicted with an accuracy of 0.51, where
random chance-level accuracy equaled 0.33. On all three tasks, the AI models
performed better than the four pathologists, although differences were not
statistically significant for most individual comparisons. Based on the
simulation experiment, implementing AI-based recommendations for ancillary
diagnostic testing could reduce material costs, turnaround times, and
examinations. In conclusion, the AI models achieved a strong predictive
performance in distinguishing between Spitz tumors and conventional melanomas.
On the more challenging tasks of predicting the genetic aberration and the
diagnostic category of Spitz tumors, the AI models performed better than random
chance.

TL;DR: 论文分析了LLM在RTL代码生成中的错误原因，提出了针对性纠正技术，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在RTL代码生成中的成功率低，缺乏对具体错误原因的理解，阻碍了改进。

Method: 通过错误分析和分类，提出基于上下文学习的纠正技术，包括知识库构建、规则检查和输入转换。

Result: 改进后的框架在VerilogEval基准测试中达到91.0%准确率，比基线方法提升32.7%。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了LLM在RTL代码生成中的主要错误，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Despite the promising potential of large language model (LLM) based
register-transfer-level (RTL) code generation, the overall success rate remains
unsatisfactory. Errors arise from various factors, with limited understanding
of specific failure causes hindering improvement. To address this, we conduct a
comprehensive error analysis and manual categorization. Our findings reveal
that most errors stem not from LLM reasoning limitations, but from insufficient
RTL programming knowledge, poor understanding of circuit concepts, ambiguous
design descriptions, or misinterpretation of complex multimodal inputs.
Leveraging in-context learning, we propose targeted error correction
techniques. Specifically, we construct a domain-specific knowledge base and
employ retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to supply necessary RTL knowledge.
To mitigate ambiguity errors, we introduce design description rules and
implement a rule-checking mechanism. For multimodal misinterpretation, we
integrate external tools to convert inputs into LLM-compatible meta-formats.
For remaining errors, we adopt an iterative debugging loop (simulation-error
localization-correction). Integrating these techniques into an LLM-based
framework significantly improves performance. We incorporate these error
correction techniques into a foundational LLM-based RTL code generation
framework, resulting in significantly improved performance. Experimental
results show that our enhanced framework achieves 91.0\% accuracy on the
VerilogEval benchmark, surpassing the baseline code generation approach by
32.7\%, demonstrating the effectiveness of our methods.

Motivation: 阿尔茨海默病是一种多因素疾病，理解其基因间相互作用对诊断和治疗至关重要。

Abstract: Understanding the molecular-level mechanisms underpinning Alzheimer's disease
(AD) by studying crucial genes associated with the disease remains a challenge.
Alzheimer's, being a multifactorial disease, requires understanding the
gene-gene interactions underlying it for theranostics and progress. In this
article, a novel attempt has been made using a quantum regression to decode how
some crucial genes in the AD Amyloid Beta Precursor Protein ($APP$), Sterol
regulatory element binding transcription factor 14 ($FGF14$), Yin Yang 1
($YY1$), and Phospholipase D Family Member 3 ($PLD3$) etc. become influenced by
other prominent switching genes during disease progression, which may help in
gene expression-based therapy for AD. Our proposed Quantum Regression Network
(Alz-QNet) introduces a pioneering approach with insights from the
state-of-the-art Quantum Gene Regulatory Networks (QGRN) to unravel the gene
interactions involved in AD pathology, particularly within the Entorhinal
Cortex (EC), where early pathological changes occur. Using the proposed
Alz-QNet framework, we explore the interactions between key genes ($APP$,
$FGF14$, $YY1$, $EGR1$, $GAS7$, $AKT3$, $SREBF2$, and $PLD3$) within the CE
microenvironment of AD patients, studying genetic samples from the database
$GSE138852$, all of which are believed to play a crucial role in the
progression of AD. Our investigation uncovers intricate gene-gene interactions,
shedding light on the potential regulatory mechanisms that underlie the
pathogenesis of AD, which help us to find potential gene inhibitors or
regulators for theranostics.

*Wafeeq Jaleel,Md Ragib Rownak,Athar Hanif,Sidra Ghayour Bhatti,Qadeer Ahmed*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于强化学习（SAC）的新框架，结合GRU和DT优化混合动力卡车能量管理，显著降低油耗并提升适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混合动力卡车需要高效的能量管理以减少油耗并延长电池寿命。

Method: 将控制任务重构为序列决策问题，在SAC中结合GRU和DT以捕捉时间依赖性。

Result: 在HFET循环中，DT-actor和GRU-critic的SAC代理油耗接近DP（1.8%以内）；在未知驾驶循环中表现优于FFN代理。

Conclusion: 结合序列感知的强化学习方法在能量管理中表现出更强的适应性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: As hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) gain traction in heavy-duty trucks,
adaptive and efficient energy management is critical for reducing fuel
consumption while maintaining battery charge for long operation times. We
present a new reinforcement learning (RL) framework based on the Soft
Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm to optimize engine control in series HEVs. We
reformulate the control task as a sequential decision-making problem and
enhance SAC by incorporating Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) and Decision
Transformers (DTs) into both actor and critic networks to capture temporal
dependencies and improve planning over time. To evaluate robustness and
generalization, we train the models under diverse initial battery states, drive
cycle durations, power demands, and input sequence lengths. Experiments show
that the SAC agent with a DT-based actor and GRU-based critic was within 1.8%
of Dynamic Programming (DP) in fuel savings on the Highway Fuel Economy Test
(HFET) cycle, while the SAC agent with GRUs in both actor and critic networks,
and FFN actor-critic agent were within 3.16% and 3.43%, respectively. On unseen
drive cycles (US06 and Heavy Heavy-Duty Diesel Truck (HHDDT) cruise segment),
generalized sequence-aware agents consistently outperformed feedforward network
(FFN)-based agents, highlighting their adaptability and robustness in
real-world settings.

### [321] [Differentially Private Model-X Knockoffs via Johnson-Lindenstrauss Transform](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04800)
*Yuxuan Tao,Adel Javanmard*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的高维控制变量选择隐私化框架，通过高斯Johnson-Lindenstrauss变换（JLT）实现差分隐私下的FDR控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有隐私机制（如拉普拉斯或高斯噪声注入）破坏了Model-X knockoff程序的核心交换性条件，无法在隐私约束下保证FDR控制。

Method: 利用高斯JLT对数据knockoff矩阵进行隐私化处理，保留协变量关系的近似等距性，实现(ε,δ)-差分隐私。

Result: 理论分析了FDR和统计功效，表明JLT的结构隐私保护优于传统噪声添加机制，即使在严格隐私预算下也能保持统计功效。

Conclusion: 该工作将knockoff-based FDR控制与隐私数据发布相结合，为敏感领域提供了可靠的变量选择方法。

Abstract: We introduce a novel privatization framework for high-dimensional controlled
variable selection. Our framework enables rigorous False Discovery Rate (FDR)
control under differential privacy constraints. While the Model-X knockoff
procedure provides FDR guarantees by constructing provably exchangeable
``negative control" features, existing privacy mechanisms like Laplace or
Gaussian noise injection disrupt its core exchangeability conditions. Our key
innovation lies in privatizing the data knockoff matrix through the Gaussian
Johnson-Lindenstrauss Transformation (JLT), a dimension reduction technique
that simultaneously preserves covariate relationships through approximate
isometry for $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy.
  We theoretically characterize both FDR and the power of the proposed private
variable selection procedure, in an asymptotic regime. Our theoretical analysis
characterizes the role of different factors, such as the JLT's dimension
reduction ratio, signal-to-noise ratio, differential privacy parameters, sample
size and feature dimension, in shaping the privacy-power trade-off. Our
analysis is based on a novel `debiasing technique' for high-dimensional private
knockoff procedure. We further establish sufficient conditions under which the
power of the proposed procedure converges to one. This work bridges two
critical paradigms -- knockoff-based FDR control and private data release --
enabling reliable variable selection in sensitive domains. Our analysis
demonstrates that structural privacy preservation through random projections
outperforms the classical noise addition mechanism, maintaining statistical
power even under strict privacy budgets.

Conclusion: 该方法在分布式高维数据中实现了差分隐私保护，同时保证了统计分析的准确性。

Abstract: With the development of big data and machine learning, privacy concerns have
become increasingly critical, especially when handling heterogeneous datasets
containing sensitive personal information. Differential privacy provides a
rigorous framework for safeguarding individual privacy while enabling
meaningful statistical analysis. In this paper, we propose a differentially
private quantile regression method for high-dimensional data in a distributed
setting. Quantile regression is a powerful and robust tool for modeling the
relationships between the covariates and responses in the presence of outliers
or heavy-tailed distributions. To address the computational challenges due to
the non-smoothness of the quantile loss function, we introduce a Newton-type
transformation that reformulates the quantile regression task into an ordinary
least squares problem. Building on this, we develop a differentially private
estimation algorithm with iterative updates, ensuring both near-optimal
statistical accuracy and formal privacy guarantees. For inference, we further
propose a differentially private debiased estimator, which enables valid
confidence interval construction and hypothesis testing. Additionally, we
propose a communication-efficient and differentially private bootstrap for
simultaneous hypothesis testing in high-dimensional quantile regression,
suitable for distributed settings with both small and abundant local data.
Extensive simulations demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of our
methods in practical scenarios.

Abstract: In functional data analysis, binary classification with one functional
covariate has been extensively studied. We aim to fill in the gap of
considering multivariate functional covariates in classification. In
particular, we propose an $L_1$-regularized functional support vector machine
for binary classification. An accompanying algorithm is developed to fit the
classifier. By imposing an $L_1$ penalty, the algorithm enables us to identify
relevant functional covariates of the binary response. Numerical results from
simulations and one real-world application demonstrate that the proposed
classifier enjoys good performance in both prediction and feature selection.

Motivation: 研究线性随机逼近算法在马尔可夫噪声下的偏差和高阶误差界限，以改进算法的性能。

Method: 采用线性化技术分解偏差，并应用Richardson-Romberg外推法消除主导偏差项。

Result: 主导偏差项被有效消除，高阶矩界限与渐近最优协方差矩阵一致。

Conclusion: Richardson-Romberg外推法能有效改进线性随机逼近算法的性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the bias and high-order error bounds of the Linear
Stochastic Approximation (LSA) algorithm with Polyak-Ruppert (PR) averaging
under Markovian noise. We focus on the version of the algorithm with constant
step size $\alpha$ and propose a novel decomposition of the bias via a
linearization technique. We analyze the structure of the bias and show that the
leading-order term is linear in $\alpha$ and cannot be eliminated by PR
averaging. To address this, we apply the Richardson-Romberg (RR) extrapolation
procedure, which effectively cancels the leading bias term. We derive
high-order moment bounds for the RR iterates and show that the leading error
term aligns with the asymptotically optimal covariance matrix of the vanilla
averaged LSA iterates.

Result: 实现高灵敏度检测、抗噪和噪声诱导信号放大。

Conclusion: 神经元功能可视为频谱在非线性变换频率域上的线性叠加。

Abstract: We propose the first fractal frequency mapping, which in a simple form
enables to replicate complex neuronal effects. Unlike the conventional filters,
which suppress or amplify the input spectral components according to the filter
weights, the transformation excites novel components by a fractal recomposition
of the input spectra resulting in a formation of spikes at resonant frequencies
that are optimal for sampling. This enables high sensitivity detection,
robustness to noise and noise-induced signal amplification. The proposed model
illustrates that a neuronal functionality can be viewed as a linear summation
of spectrum over nonlinearly transformed frequency domain.

Conclusion: SLG简化了算法，为低量子比特数纠缠态的自动化构建提供了实用工具。

Abstract: We have devised an artificial intelligence algorithm with machine
reinforcement learning (Q-learning) to construct remarkable entangled states
with 4 qubits. This way, the algorithm is able to generate representative
states for some of the 49 true SLOCC classes of the four-qubit entanglement
states. In particular, it is possible to reach at least one true SLOCC class
for each of the nine entanglement families. The quantum circuits synthesized by
the algorithm may be useful for the experimental realization of these important
classes of entangled states and to draw conclusions about the intrinsic
properties of our universe. We introduce a graphical tool called the state-link
graph (SLG) to represent the construction of the Quality matrix (Q-matrix) used
by the algorithm to build a given objective state belonging to the
corresponding entanglement class. This allows us to discover the necessary
connections between specific entanglement features and the role of certain
quantum gates that the algorithm needs to include in the quantum gate set of
actions. The quantum circuits found are optimal by construction with respect to
the quantum gate-set chosen. These SLGs make the algorithm simple, intuitive
and a useful resource for the automated construction of entangled states with a
low number of qubits.

Motivation: 解决量子电路中目标态合成的核心挑战，管理量子态空间的指数增长问题。

Result: 在七量子比特的图态制备任务中，算法能发现最小深度和优化门数的电路，且适用于通用门集。

Conclusion: 该RL方法能高效探索复杂量子态空间，合成近最优量子电路，为量子电路优化提供了资源高效的基础。

Abstract: A reinforcement learning (RL) framework is introduced for the efficient
synthesis of quantum circuits that generate specified target quantum states
from a fixed initial state, addressing a central challenge in both the NISQ era
and future fault-tolerant quantum computing. The approach utilizes tabular
Q-learning, based on action sequences, within a discretized quantum state
space, to effectively manage the exponential growth of the space dimension. The
framework introduces a hybrid reward mechanism, combining a static,
domain-informed reward that guides the agent toward the target state with
customizable dynamic penalties that discourage inefficient circuit structures
such as gate congestion and redundant state revisits. By leveraging sparse
matrix representations and state-space discretization, the method enables
scalable navigation of high-dimensional environments while minimizing
computational overhead. Benchmarking on graph-state preparation tasks for up to
seven qubits, we demonstrate that the algorithm consistently discovers
minimal-depth circuits with optimized gate counts. Moreover, extending the
framework to a universal gate set for arbitrary quantum states, it still
produces minimal depth circuits, highlighting the algorithm's robustness and
adaptability. The results confirm that this RL-driven approach efficiently
explores the complex quantum state space and synthesizes near-optimal quantum
circuits, providing a resource-efficient foundation for quantum circuit
optimization.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合量子计算和差分隐私的时间序列预测框架Q-DPTS，在保证隐私的同时提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在金融和能源系统等领域，时间序列预测的数据敏感性很高，差分隐私（DP）虽能保护数据隐私，但传统方法（如DP-SGD）会因噪声注入降低模型性能。

Method: Q-DPTS结合变分量子电路（VQCs）、逐样本梯度裁剪和高斯噪声注入，确保严格的差分隐私（(ε, δ)-DP），并利用量子模型的表达能力减少隐私机制带来的性能损失。

Result: 在ETT数据集上，Q-DPTS在相同隐私预算下比经典和量子基线模型（如LSTM、QASA等）预测误差更低，展现了更好的隐私-效用平衡。

Conclusion: Q-DPTS是量子增强差分隐私预测的首次探索之一，为隐私关键场景下的安全准确时间序列建模提供了新方向。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is vital in domains where data sensitivity is
paramount, such as finance and energy systems. While Differential Privacy (DP)
provides theoretical guarantees to protect individual data contributions, its
integration especially via DP-SGD often impairs model performance due to
injected noise. In this paper, we propose Q-DPTS, a hybrid quantum-classical
framework for Quantum Differentially Private Time Series Forecasting. Q-DPTS
combines Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) with per-sample gradient clipping
and Gaussian noise injection, ensuring rigorous $(\epsilon,
\delta)$-differential privacy. The expressiveness of quantum models enables
improved robustness against the utility loss induced by DP mechanisms. We
evaluate Q-DPTS on the ETT (Electricity Transformer Temperature) dataset, a
standard benchmark for long-term time series forecasting. Our approach is
compared against both classical and quantum baselines, including LSTM, QASA,
QRWKV, and QLSTM. Results demonstrate that Q-DPTS consistently achieves lower
prediction error under the same privacy budget, indicating a favorable
privacy-utility trade-off. This work presents one of the first explorations
into quantum-enhanced differentially private forecasting, offering promising
directions for secure and accurate time series modeling in privacy-critical
scenarios.

Abstract: We investigate the application of hybrid quantum tensor networks to
aeroelastic problems, harnessing the power of Quantum Machine Learning (QML).
By combining tensor networks with variational quantum circuits, we demonstrate
the potential of QML to tackle complex time series classification and
regression tasks. Our results showcase the ability of hybrid quantum tensor
networks to achieve high accuracy in binary classification. Furthermore, we
observe promising performance in regressing discrete variables. While
hyperparameter selection remains a challenge, requiring careful optimisation to
unlock the full potential of these models, this work contributes significantly
to the development of QML for solving intricate problems in aeroelasticity. We
present an end-to-end trainable hybrid algorithm. We first encode time series
into tensor networks to then utilise trainable tensor networks for
dimensionality reduction, and convert the resulting tensor to a quantum circuit
in the encoding step. Then, a tensor network inspired trainable variational
quantum circuit is applied to solve either a classification or a multivariate
or univariate regression task in the aeroelasticity domain.

Abstract: Large language models (LLM) exhibit broad utility but face limitations in
quantum sensor development, stemming from interdisciplinary knowledge barriers
and involving complex optimization processes. Here we present QCopilot, an
LLM-based multi-agent framework integrating external knowledge access, active
learning, and uncertainty quantification for quantum sensor design and
diagnosis. Comprising commercial LLMs with few-shot prompt engineering and
vector knowledge base, QCopilot employs specialized agents to adaptively select
optimization methods, automate modeling analysis, and independently perform
problem diagnosis. Applying QCopilot to atom cooling experiments, we generated
10${}^{\rm{8}}$ sub-$\rm{\mu}$K atoms without any human intervention within a
few hours, representing $\sim$100$\times$ speedup over manual experimentation.
Notably, by continuously accumulating prior knowledge and enabling dynamic
modeling, QCopilot can autonomously identify anomalous parameters in
multi-parameter experimental settings. Our work reduces barriers to large-scale
quantum sensor deployment and readily extends to other quantum information
systems.

Abstract: Pulse-based Quantum Machine Learning (QML) has emerged as a novel paradigm in
quantum artificial intelligence due to its exceptional hardware efficiency. For
practical applications, pulse-based models must be both expressive and
trainable. Previous studies suggest that pulse-based models under dynamic
symmetry can be effectively trained, thanks to a favorable loss landscape that
has no barren plateaus. However, the resulting uncontrollability may compromise
expressivity when the model is inadequately designed. This paper investigates
the requirements for pulse-based QML models to be expressive while preserving
trainability. We present a necessary condition pertaining to the system's
initial state, the measurement observable, and the underlying dynamical
symmetry Lie algebra, supported by numerical simulations. Our findings
establish a framework for designing practical pulse-based QML models that
balance expressivity and trainability.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 几何Jensen-Shannon散度（G-JSD）在机器学习和信息科学中因其高斯分布间的闭式解而流行。然而，现有定义需要归一化几何混合，限制了其应用范围。本文旨在提出一种无需归一化的扩展G-JSD，以适用于更广泛的正密度。

Method: 提出扩展G-JSD的定义，明确其与G-JSD的差距，并给出统计散度的上下界。针对多元高斯分布推导闭式解，并分析其与普通JSD的关系。

Result: 扩展G-JSD适用于更广泛的正密度，无需归一化几何混合。给出了与G-JSD的差距及上下界，并针对多元高斯分布提供了闭式解。

Conclusion: 扩展G-JSD为普通JSD的正则化形式，适用于更广泛的正密度，无需归一化几何混合，为机器学习和信息科学提供了新的工具。

Abstract: The geometric Jensen--Shannon divergence (G-JSD) gained popularity in machine
learning and information sciences thanks to its closed-form expression between
Gaussian distributions. In this work, we introduce an alternative definition of
the geometric Jensen--Shannon divergence tailored to positive densities which
does not normalize geometric mixtures. This novel divergence is termed the
extended G-JSD as it extends to more general positive measures. We give
explicitly the gap between the extended G-JSD and G-JSD when considering
probability densities, and report both lower and upper bounds in terms of other
statistical divergences. We derive corresponding closed-form expressions when
considering the case of multivariate Gaussian distributions often met in
applications. Finally, we show that these two types of geometric JSDs, the
G-JSD and the extended G-JSD, can be interpreted as regularizations of the
ordinary JSD by additive terms.

TL;DR: 论文研究了在重尾噪声条件下，普通随机梯度下降（SGD）的理论表现，证明了其在凸、强凸和非凸问题中的收敛性，并展示了其最优样本复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨SGD在重尾噪声（现代机器学习和强化学习中常见）下的有效性，挑战了SGD在此条件下无效的普遍观点。

Method: 假设随机梯度具有有界的p阶矩（p∈(1,2]），分析了SGD在凸、强凸和非凸问题中的收敛性，并考虑了Mini-batch SGD的表现。

Result: SGD在凸和强凸问题中达到极小极大最优样本复杂度，分别为O(ε^(-p/(p-1)))和O(ε^(-p/(2(p-1))))；在非凸问题中收敛到平稳点，速率为O(ε^(-2p/(p-1)))。

Conclusion: 普通SGD在重尾噪声下仍具有鲁棒性和理论保证，即使方差无界。

Abstract: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a cornerstone of large-scale
optimization, yet its theoretical behavior under heavy-tailed noise -- common
in modern machine learning and reinforcement learning -- remains poorly
understood. In this work, we rigorously investigate whether vanilla SGD, devoid
of any adaptive modifications, can provably succeed under such adverse
stochastic conditions. Assuming only that stochastic gradients have bounded
$p$-th moments for some $p \in (1, 2]$, we establish sharp convergence
guarantees for (projected) SGD across convex, strongly convex, and non-convex
problem classes. In particular, we show that SGD achieves minimax optimal
sample complexity under minimal assumptions in the convex and strongly convex
regimes: $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-\frac{p}{p-1}})$ and
$\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-\frac{p}{2(p-1)}})$, respectively. For non-convex
objectives under H\"older smoothness, we prove convergence to a stationary
point with rate $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-\frac{2p}{p-1}})$, and complement
this with a matching lower bound specific to SGD with arbitrary polynomial
step-size schedules. Finally, we consider non-convex Mini-batch SGD under
standard smoothness and bounded central moment assumptions, and show that it
also achieves a comparable $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-\frac{2p}{p-1}})$ sample
complexity with a potential improvement in the smoothness constant. These
results challenge the prevailing view that heavy-tailed noise renders SGD
ineffective, and establish vanilla SGD as a robust and theoretically principled
baseline -- even in regimes where the variance is unbounded.

Abstract: Biclustering, also known as co-clustering or two-way clustering,
simultaneously partitions the rows and columns of a data matrix to reveal
submatrices with coherent patterns. Incorporating background knowledge into
clustering to enhance solution quality and interpretability has attracted
growing interest in mathematical optimization and machine learning research.
Extending this paradigm to biclustering enables prior information to guide the
joint grouping of rows and columns. We study constrained biclustering with
pairwise constraints, namely must-link and cannot-link constraints, which
specify whether objects should belong to the same or different biclusters. As a
model problem, we address the constrained version of the k-densest disjoint
biclique problem, which aims to identify k disjoint complete bipartite
subgraphs (called bicliques) in a weighted complete bipartite graph, maximizing
the total density while satisfying pairwise constraints. We propose both exact
and heuristic algorithms. The exact approach is a tailored branch-and-cut
algorithm based on a low-dimensional semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation,
strengthened with valid inequalities and solved in a cutting-plane fashion.
Exploiting integer programming tools, a rounding scheme converts SDP solutions
into feasible biclusterings at each node. For large-scale instances, we
introduce an efficient heuristic based on the low-rank factorization of the
SDP. The resulting nonlinear optimization problem is tackled with an augmented
Lagrangian method, where the subproblem is solved by decomposition through a
block-coordinate projected gradient algorithm. Extensive experiments on
synthetic and real-world datasets show that the exact method significantly
outperforms general-purpose solvers, while the heuristic achieves high-quality
solutions efficiently on large instances.

Abstract: Standard Bayesian retrievals for exoplanet atmospheric parameters from
transmission spectroscopy, while well understood and widely used, are generally
computationally expensive. In the era of the JWST and other upcoming
observatories, machine learning approaches have emerged as viable alternatives
that are both efficient and robust. In this paper we present a systematic study
of several existing machine learning regression techniques and compare their
performance for retrieving exoplanet atmospheric parameters from transmission
spectra. We benchmark the performance of the different algorithms on the
accuracy, precision, and speed. The regression methods tested here include
partial least squares (PLS), support vector machines (SVM), k nearest neighbors
(KNN), decision trees (DT), random forests (RF), voting (VOTE), stacking
(STACK), and extreme gradient boosting (XGB). We also investigate the impact of
different preprocessing methods of the training data on the model performance.
We quantify the model uncertainties across the entire dynamical range of
planetary parameters. The best performing combination of ML model and
preprocessing scheme is validated on a the case study of JWST observation of
WASP-39b.

Abstract: Structural High Entropy Alloys (HEAs) are crucial in advancing technology
across various sectors, including aerospace, automotive, and defense
industries. However, the scarcity of integrated chemistry, process, structure,
and property data presents significant challenges for predictive property
modeling. Given the vast design space of these alloys, uncovering the
underlying patterns is essential yet difficult, requiring advanced methods
capable of learning from limited and heterogeneous datasets. This work presents
several sensitivity analyses, highlighting key elemental contributions to
mechanical behavior, including insights into the compositional factors
associated with brittle and fractured responses observed during nanoindentation
testing in the BIRDSHOT center NiCoFeCrVMnCuAl system dataset. Several encoder
decoder based chemistry property models, carefully tuned through Bayesian multi
objective hyperparameter optimization, are evaluated for mapping alloy
composition to six mechanical properties. The models achieve competitive or
superior performance to conventional regressors across all properties,
particularly for yield strength and the UTS/YS ratio, demonstrating their
effectiveness in capturing complex composition property relationships.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注AV控制算法的技术性能，而忽略了其对人类驾驶员的交互影响。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出了一个包含四个关键领域（交互效果、交互感知、交互努力和交互能力）的评估框架，并通过驾驶模拟器中的合并场景案例研究验证其有效性。

Result: 结果显示，综合四个领域的指标可以揭示AV与HDV交互中的关键差异，强调需要更全面的评估方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为研究者、开发者和政策制定者提供了系统评估AV行为的方法，促进开发不仅功能强大且对人类友好的AV。

Abstract: As automated vehicles (AVs) increasingly integrate into mixed-traffic
environments, evaluating their interaction with human-driven vehicles (HDVs)
becomes critical. In most research focused on developing new AV control
algorithms (controllers), the performance of these algorithms is assessed
solely based on performance metrics such as collision avoidance or lane-keeping
efficiency, while largely overlooking the human-centred dimensions of
interaction with HDVs. This paper proposes a structured evaluation framework
that addresses this gap by incorporating metrics grounded in the human-robot
interaction literature. The framework spans four key domains: a) interaction
effect, b) interaction perception, c) interaction effort, and d) interaction
ability. These domains capture both the performance of the AV and its impact on
human drivers around it. To demonstrate the utility of the framework, we apply
it to a case study evaluating how a state-of-the-art AV controller interacts
with human drivers in a merging scenario in a driving simulator. Measuring
HDV-HDV interactions as a baseline, this study included one representative
metric per domain: a) perceived safety, b) subjective ratings, specifically how
participants perceived the other vehicle's driving behaviour (e.g.,
aggressiveness or predictability) , c) driver workload, and d) merging success.
The results showed that incorporating metrics covering all four domains in the
evaluation of AV controllers can illuminate critical differences in driver
experience when interacting with AVs. This highlights the need for a more
comprehensive evaluation approach. Our framework offers researchers,
developers, and policymakers a systematic method for assessing AV behaviour
beyond technical performance, fostering the development of AVs that are not
only functionally capable but also understandable, acceptable, and safe from a
human perspective.

Method: 通过10,000名参与者比较五大AI搜索系统的回答，分析用户偏好。

Result: 用户显著偏好简洁、有来源的回答，复杂回答导致认知负担和信任下降。

Conclusion: AI应模仿人类有效沟通方式：简洁、透明、诚实，以提高用户满意度和系统可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) in search applications increasingly prioritize
verbose, lexically complex responses that paradoxically reduce user
satisfaction and engagement. Through a comprehensive study of 10.000 (est.)
participants comparing responses from five major AI-powered search systems, we
demonstrate that users overwhelmingly prefer concise, source-attributed
responses over elaborate explanations. Our analysis reveals that current AI
development trends toward "artificial sophistication" create an uncanny valley
effect where systems sound knowledgeable but lack genuine critical thinking,
leading to reduced trust and increased cognitive load. We present evidence that
optimal AI communication mirrors effective human discourse: direct, properly
sourced, and honest about limitations. Our findings challenge the prevailing
assumption that more complex AI responses indicate better performance, instead
suggesting that human-like brevity and transparency are key to user engagement
and system reliability.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have rendered visible the
fragility of contemporary knowledge infrastructures by simulating coherence
while bypassing traditional modes of citation, authority, and validation. This
paper introduces the Situated Epistemic Infrastructures (SEI) framework as a
diagnostic tool for analyzing how knowledge becomes authoritative across hybrid
human-machine systems under post-coherence conditions. Rather than relying on
stable scholarly domains or bounded communities of practice, SEI traces how
credibility is mediated across institutional, computational, and temporal
arrangements. Integrating insights from infrastructure studies, platform
theory, and epistemology, the framework foregrounds coordination over
classification, emphasizing the need for anticipatory and adaptive models of
epistemic stewardship. The paper contributes to debates on AI governance,
knowledge production, and the ethical design of information systems by offering
a robust alternative to representationalist models of scholarly communication.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的通道级EEG特征选择方法（CWEFS），用于多维情绪识别，通过整合共享潜在结构模型和自适应通道权重学习，显著提升了情绪识别的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维多通道EEG特征中存在大量冗余和无关信息，影响了情绪表征的提取和实时性能，现有方法忽略了潜在EEG特征结构对情绪标签相关性的影响。

Method: CWEFS结合了共享潜在结构模型和自适应通道权重学习，构建共识潜在空间并保留局部几何结构，同时考虑多维情绪标签的潜在语义分析。

Result: 在三个流行的EEG数据集上验证，CWEFS选择的特征子集在六个评估指标上均达到最优情绪识别性能。

Conclusion: CWEFS方法有效解决了EEG特征选择中的问题，显著提升了多维情绪识别的准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: Due to the intracranial volume conduction effects, high-dimensional
multi-channel electroencephalography (EEG) features often contain substantial
redundant and irrelevant information. This issue not only hinders the
extraction of discriminative emotional representations but also compromises the
real-time performance. Feature selection has been established as an effective
approach to address the challenges while enhancing the transparency and
interpretability of emotion recognition models. However, existing EEG feature
selection research overlooks the influence of latent EEG feature structures on
emotional label correlations and assumes uniform importance across various
channels, directly limiting the precise construction of EEG feature selection
models for multi-dimensional affective computing. To address these limitations,
a novel channel-wise EEG feature selection (CWEFS) method is proposed for
multi-dimensional emotion recognition. Specifically, inspired by brain volume
conduction effects, CWEFS integrates EEG emotional feature selection into a
shared latent structure model designed to construct a consensus latent space
across diverse EEG channels. To preserve the local geometric structure, this
consensus space is further integrated with the latent semantic analysis of
multi-dimensional emotional labels. Additionally, CWEFS incorporates adaptive
channel-weight learning to automatically determine the significance of
different EEG channels in the emotional feature selection task. The
effectiveness of CWEFS was validated using three popular EEG datasets with
multi-dimensional emotional labels. Comprehensive experimental results,
compared against nineteen feature selection methods, demonstrate that the EEG
feature subsets chosen by CWEFS achieve optimal emotion recognition performance
across six evaluation metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有EEG特征选择方法假设标签完整，但实际中标签常不完整，影响模型泛化能力。现有方法忽略标签空间中样本与维度的交互。

Method: 提出自适应双自表达学习（ADSEL）结合最小二乘回归，通过双向信息共享同时利用样本和维度信息进行标签重建。

Result: ADSEL提高了标签恢复精度，并有效识别最优EEG特征子集。

Conclusion: 新算法在处理不完整多维标签和特征选择上表现优越，适用于EEG情绪识别。

Abstract: EEG based multi-dimension emotion recognition has attracted substantial
research interest in human computer interfaces. However, the high
dimensionality of EEG features, coupled with limited sample sizes, frequently
leads to classifier overfitting and high computational complexity. Feature
selection constitutes a critical strategy for mitigating these challenges. Most
existing EEG feature selection methods assume complete multi-dimensional
emotion labels. In practice, open acquisition environment, and the inherent
subjectivity of emotion perception often result in incomplete label data, which
can compromise model generalization. Additionally, existing feature selection
methods for handling incomplete multi-dimensional labels primarily focus on
correlations among various dimensions during label recovery, neglecting the
correlation between samples in the label space and their interaction with
various dimensions. To address these issues, we propose a novel incomplete
multi-dimensional feature selection algorithm for EEG-based emotion
recognition. The proposed method integrates an adaptive dual self-expression
learning (ADSEL) with least squares regression. ADSEL establishes a
bidirectional pathway between sample-level and dimension-level self-expression
learning processes within the label space. It could facilitate the
cross-sharing of learned information between these processes, enabling the
simultaneous exploitation of effective information across both samples and
dimensions for label reconstruction. Consequently, ADSEL could enhances label
recovery accuracy and effectively identifies the optimal EEG feature subset for
multi-dimensional emotion recognition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前EEG情感识别方法通常将去噪和情感识别视为独立任务，导致误差累积且未能利用任务间的协同效应。此外，现有模型缺乏对噪声鲁棒性的系统设计。

Method: FDC-Net通过双向梯度传播和联合优化策略，以及结合门控注意力机制和频率自适应Transformer的动态协作机制，实现去噪与情感识别的耦合。

Result: 在DEAP和DREAMER数据集上，FDC-Net在去噪任务中分别达到96.30%和90.31%的最大相关系数，在情感识别任务中分别达到82.3%和88.1%的准确率。

Conclusion: FDC-Net通过动态协作机制显著提升了噪声鲁棒性，为EEG情感识别提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based emotion recognition holds significant value
in affective computing and brain-computer interfaces. However, in practical
applications, EEG recordings are susceptible to the effects of various
physiological artifacts. Current approaches typically treat denoising and
emotion recognition as independent tasks using cascaded architectures, which
not only leads to error accumulation, but also fails to exploit potential
synergies between these tasks. Moreover, conventional EEG-based emotion
recognition models often rely on the idealized assumption of "perfectly
denoised data", lacking a systematic design for noise robustness. To address
these challenges, a novel framework that deeply couples denoising and emotion
recognition tasks is proposed for end-to-end noise-robust emotion recognition,
termed as Feedback-Driven Collaborative Network for Denoising-Classification
Nexus (FDC-Net). Our primary innovation lies in establishing a dynamic
collaborative mechanism between artifact removal and emotion recognition
through: (1) bidirectional gradient propagation with joint optimization
strategies; (2) a gated attention mechanism integrated with frequency-adaptive
Transformer using learnable band-position encoding. Two most popular EEG-based
emotion datasets (DEAP and DREAMER) with multi-dimensional emotional labels
were employed to compare the artifact removal and emotion recognition
performance between ASLSL and nine state-of-the-art methods. In terms of the
denoising task, FDC-Net obtains a maximum correlation coefficient (CC) value of
96.30% on DEAP and a maximum CC value of 90.31% on DREAMER. In terms of the
emotion recognition task under physiological artifact interference, FDC-Net
achieves emotion recognition accuracies of 82.3+7.1% on DEAP and 88.1+0.8% on
DREAMER.

Abstract: Level 3 automated driving systems allows drivers to engage in secondary tasks
while diminishing their perception of risk. In the event of an emergency
necessitating driver intervention, the system will alert the driver with a
limited window for reaction and imposing a substantial cognitive burden. To
address this challenge, this study employs a Large Language Model (LLM) to
assist drivers in maintaining an appropriate attention on road conditions
through a "humanized" persuasive advice. Our tool leverages the road conditions
encountered by Level 3 systems as triggers, proactively steering driver
behavior via both visual and auditory routes. Empirical study indicates that
our tool is effective in sustaining driver attention with reduced cognitive
load and coordinating secondary tasks with takeover behavior. Our work provides
insights into the potential of using LLMs to support drivers during multi-task
automated driving.

Result: VQGAN生成的图像在下游任务（如核分割和组织分类）中表现更优。

Conclusion: 多级VQGAN是生成科学有用虚拟染色的强大架构，有助于整合mIF数据到H&E分析流程。

Abstract: While multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) imaging provides deep,
spatially-resolved molecular data, integrating this information with the
morphological standard of Hematoxylin & Eosin (H&E) can be very important for
obtaining complementary information about the underlying tissue. Generating a
virtual H&E stain from mIF data offers a powerful solution, providing immediate
morphological context. Crucially, this approach enables the application of the
vast ecosystem of H&E-based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) tools to analyze
rich molecular data, bridging the gap between molecular and morphological
analysis. In this work, we investigate the use of a multi-level
Vector-Quantized Generative Adversarial Network (VQGAN) to create high-fidelity
virtual H&E stains from mIF images. We rigorously evaluated our VQGAN against a
standard conditional GAN (cGAN) baseline on two publicly available colorectal
cancer datasets, assessing performance on both image similarity and functional
utility for downstream analysis. Our results show that while both architectures
produce visually plausible images, the virtual stains generated by our VQGAN
provide a more effective substrate for computer-aided diagnosis. Specifically,
downstream nuclei segmentation and semantic preservation in tissue
classification tasks performed on VQGAN-generated images demonstrate superior
performance and agreement with ground-truth analysis compared to those from the
cGAN. This work establishes that a multi-level VQGAN is a robust and superior
architecture for generating scientifically useful virtual stains, offering a
viable pathway to integrate the rich molecular data of mIF into established and
powerful H&E-based analytical workflows.

Motivation: 视网膜脱离（RD）需及时干预，黄斑状态是关键预后因素。超声检测虽便捷但依赖专家解读，深度学习可自动化此过程，但缺乏相关数据和算法。

Method: 创建ERDES数据集，包含标记的超声视频片段，用于RD检测和黄斑状态分类，并提供多种时空CNN架构的基准测试。

Result: ERDES数据集公开可用，支持RD检测和黄斑状态分类的机器学习模型开发。

Conclusion: ERDES填补了RD超声检测的公开数据空白，为自动化诊断工具开发提供了基础。

Abstract: Retinal detachment (RD) is a vision-threatening condition that requires
timely intervention to preserve vision. Macular involvement -- whether the
macula is still intact (macula-intact) or detached (macula-detached) -- is the
key determinant of visual outcomes and treatment urgency. Point-of-care
ultrasound (POCUS) offers a fast, non-invasive, cost-effective, and accessible
imaging modality widely used in diverse clinical settings to detect RD.
However, ultrasound image interpretation is limited by a lack of expertise
among healthcare providers, especially in resource-limited settings. Deep
learning offers the potential to automate ultrasound-based assessment of RD.
However, there are no ML ultrasound algorithms currently available for clinical
use to detect RD and no prior research has been done on assessing macular
status using ultrasound in RD cases -- an essential distinction for surgical
prioritization. Moreover, no public dataset currently supports macular-based RD
classification using ultrasound video clips. We introduce Eye Retinal
DEtachment ultraSound, ERDES, the first open-access dataset of ocular
ultrasound clips labeled for (i) presence of retinal detachment and (ii)
macula-intact versus macula-detached status. The dataset is intended to
facilitate the development and evaluation of machine learning models for
detecting retinal detachment. We also provide baseline benchmarks using
multiple spatiotemporal convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures. All

Abstract: Protein language models (PLMs) learn probability distributions over natural
protein sequences. By learning from hundreds of millions of natural protein
sequences, protein understanding and design capabilities emerge. Recent works
have shown that scaling these models improves structure prediction, but does
not seem to improve mutation understanding and representation quality for
protein function prediction. We introduce PoET-2, a multimodal,
retrieval-augmented protein foundation model that incorporates in-context
learning of family-specific evolutionary constraints with optional structure
conditioning to learn generative distributions over protein sequences. PoET-2
uses a hierarchical transformer encoder that is equivariant to sequence context
ordering and a dual decoder architecture with both causal and masked language
modeling objectives, allowing PoET-2 to operate in both fully generative and
bidirectional representation learning modes. PoET-2 achieves state-of-the-art
performance on zero-shot variant effect prediction, excelling at scoring
variants with multiple mutations and challenging indel mutations. In supervised
settings, PoET-2 embeddings outperform previous methods for learning
sequence-function relationships, especially with small datasets. This work
highlights the benefits of combining retrieval augmentation with multimodal,
family-centric modeling for advancing protein foundation models.

Abstract: Multimodal recommendation systems are increasingly popular for their
potential to improve performance by integrating diverse data types. However,
the actual benefits of this integration remain unclear, raising questions about
when and how it truly enhances recommendations. In this paper, we propose a
structured evaluation framework to systematically assess multimodal
recommendations across four dimensions: Comparative Efficiency, Recommendation
Tasks, Recommendation Stages, and Multimodal Data Integration. We benchmark a
set of reproducible multimodal models against strong traditional baselines and
evaluate their performance on different platforms. Our findings show that
multimodal data is particularly beneficial in sparse interaction scenarios and
during the recall stage of recommendation pipelines. We also observe that the
importance of each modality is task-specific, where text features are more
useful in e-commerce and visual features are more effective in short-video
recommendations. Additionally, we explore different integration strategies and
model sizes, finding that Ensemble-Based Learning outperforms Fusion-Based
Learning, and that larger models do not necessarily deliver better results. To
deepen our understanding, we include case studies and review findings from
other recommendation domains. Our work provides practical insights for building
efficient and effective multimodal recommendation systems, emphasizing the need
for thoughtful modality selection, integration strategies, and model design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着学术出版物快速增长，识别高质量研究成为挑战，现有LLM方法因领域知识过时和推理能力有限而受限。

Method: PaperEval包含领域感知检索模块和潜在推理机制，采用渐进排名优化策略迭代优化预测。

Result: 在两个数据集上，PaperEval在学术影响和论文质量评估上均优于现有方法，实际应用中表现优异。

Conclusion: PaperEval通过创新方法解决了LLM在论文评估中的局限性，展示了实际应用潜力。

Abstract: With the rapid and continuous increase in academic publications, identifying
high-quality research has become an increasingly pressing challenge. While
recent methods leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated paper
evaluation have shown great promise, they are often constrained by outdated
domain knowledge and limited reasoning capabilities. In this work, we present
PaperEval, a novel LLM-based framework for automated paper evaluation that
addresses these limitations through two key components: 1) a domain-aware paper
retrieval module that retrieves relevant concurrent work to support
contextualized assessments of novelty and contributions, and 2) a latent
reasoning mechanism that enables deep understanding of complex motivations and
methodologies, along with comprehensive comparison against concurrently related
work, to support more accurate and reliable evaluation. To guide the reasoning
process, we introduce a progressive ranking optimization strategy that
encourages the LLM to iteratively refine its predictions with an emphasis on
relative comparison. Experiments on two datasets demonstrate that PaperEval
consistently outperforms existing methods in both academic impact and paper
quality evaluation. In addition, we deploy PaperEval in a real-world paper
recommendation system for filtering high-quality papers, which has gained
strong engagement on social media -- amassing over 8,000 subscribers and
attracting over 10,000 views for many filtered high-quality papers --
demonstrating the practical effectiveness of PaperEval.

Result: 在四个跨域数据集上的实验验证了HorizonRec在细粒度偏好融合中的有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: HorizonRec通过扩散模型优化了跨域推荐中的偏好融合，显著提升了推荐性能。

Abstract: Personalized sequential recommendation aims to predict appropriate items for
users based on their behavioral sequences. To alleviate data sparsity and
interest drift issues, conventional approaches typically incorporate auxiliary
behaviors from other domains via cross-domain transition. However, existing
cross-domain sequential recommendation (CDSR) methods often follow an
align-then-fusion paradigm that performs representation-level alignment across
multiple domains and combines them mechanically for recommendation, overlooking
the fine-grained fusion of domain-specific preferences. Inspired by recent
advances in diffusion models (DMs) for distribution matching, we propose an
align-for-fusion framework for CDSR to harmonize triple preferences via
dual-oriented DMs, termed HorizonRec. Specifically, we investigate the
uncertainty injection of DMs and identify stochastic noise as a key source of
instability in existing DM-based recommenders. To address this, we introduce a
mixed-conditioned distribution retrieval strategy that leverages distributions
retrieved from users' authentic behavioral logic as semantic bridges across
domains, enabling consistent multi-domain preference modeling. Furthermore, we
propose a dual-oriented preference diffusion method to suppress potential noise
and emphasize target-relevant interests during multi-domain user representation
fusion. Extensive experiments on four CDSR datasets from two distinct platforms
demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of HorizonRec in fine-grained
triple-domain preference fusion.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 论文提出Tool Graph Retriever (TGR)，通过工具依赖关系改进工具检索性能，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具检索方法仅依赖语义相似性，忽略了工具间的依赖关系，可能导致遗漏关键工具。

Method: 构建TDI300K数据集训练依赖判别器，将工具表示为依赖图，用图卷积整合依赖关系。

Result: 实验显示TGR显著提升现有方法性能，达到SOTA。

Conclusion: 工具依赖关系对检索至关重要，TGR方法有效且高效。

Abstract: With the remarkable advancement of AI agents, the number of their equipped
tools is increasing rapidly. However, integrating all tool information into the
limited model context becomes impractical, highlighting the need for efficient
tool retrieval methods. In this regard, dominant methods primarily rely on
semantic similarities between tool descriptions and user queries to retrieve
relevant tools. However, they often consider each tool independently,
overlooking dependencies between tools, which may lead to the omission of
prerequisite tools for successful task execution. To deal with this defect, in
this paper, we propose Tool Graph Retriever (TGR), which exploits the
dependencies among tools to learn better tool representations for retrieval.
First, we construct a dataset termed TDI300K to train a discriminator for
identifying tool dependencies. Then, we represent all candidate tools as a tool
dependency graph and use graph convolution to integrate the dependencies into
their representations. Finally, these updated tool representations are employed
for online retrieval. Experimental results on several commonly used datasets
show that our TGR can bring a performance improvement to existing dominant
methods, achieving SOTA performance. Moreover, in-depth analyses also verify
the importance of tool dependencies and the effectiveness of our TGR.

Motivation: 解决传统个性化流行度评分（PPS）在音乐推荐中过度强化已知内容而忽视新颖性的问题。

Method: 基于RecJPQ框架，利用子ID级别的建模捕捉重复模式，提出sPPS方法，平衡准确性与新颖性。

Result: sPPS在保持推荐准确性的同时，显著提升了个性化新颖性。

Conclusion: sPPS方法有效解决了传统PPS的局限性，为音乐推荐系统提供了更好的平衡策略。

Abstract: In the realm of music recommendation, sequential recommenders have shown
promise in capturing the dynamic nature of music consumption. A key
characteristic of this domain is repetitive listening, where users frequently
replay familiar tracks. To capture these repetition patterns, recent research
has introduced Personalised Popularity Scores (PPS), which quantify
user-specific preferences based on historical frequency. While PPS enhances
relevance in recommendation, it often reinforces already-known content,
limiting the system's ability to surface novel or serendipitous items - key
elements for fostering long-term user engagement and satisfaction. To address
this limitation, we build upon RecJPQ, a Transformer-based framework initially
developed to improve scalability in large-item catalogues through sub-item
decomposition. We repurpose RecJPQ's sub-item architecture to model
personalised popularity at a finer granularity. This allows us to capture
shared repetition patterns across sub-embeddings - latent structures not
accessible through item-level popularity alone. We propose a novel integration
of sub-ID-level personalised popularity within the RecJPQ framework, enabling
explicit control over the trade-off between accuracy and personalised novelty.
Our sub-ID-level PPS method (sPPS) consistently outperforms item-level PPS by
achieving significantly higher personalised novelty without compromising
recommendation accuracy. Code and experiments are publicly available at

Result: 实现了5.3倍的序列长度扩展和1.55倍的并行效率提升。

Conclusion: 该方法为推荐系统中长序列建模提供了有效的并行解决方案。

Abstract: Large-scale recommendation systems are pivotal to process an immense volume
of daily user interactions, requiring the effective modeling of high
cardinality and heterogeneous features to ensure accurate predictions. In prior
work, we introduced Hierarchical Sequential Transducers (HSTU), an
attention-based architecture for modeling high cardinality, non-stationary
streaming recommendation data, providing good scaling law in the generative
recommender framework (GR). Recent studies and experiments demonstrate that
attending to longer user history sequences yields significant metric
improvements. However, scaling sequence length is activation-heavy,
necessitating parallelism solutions to effectively shard activation memory. In
transformer-based LLMs, context parallelism (CP) is a commonly used technique
that distributes computation along the sequence-length dimension across
multiple GPUs, effectively reducing memory usage from attention activations. In
contrast, production ranking models typically utilize jagged input tensors to
represent user interaction features, introducing unique CP implementation
challenges. In this work, we introduce context parallelism with jagged tensor
support for HSTU attention, establishing foundational capabilities for scaling
up sequence dimensions. Our approach enables a 5.3x increase in supported user
interaction sequence length, while achieving a 1.55x scaling factor when
combined with Distributed Data Parallelism (DDP).

Conclusion: LIS是一种有效的度量标准，能够解决多模态推荐系统中的对齐评估问题，并在实际应用中取得了显著效果。

Abstract: Multimodal recommendation has emerged as a critical technique in modern
recommender systems, leveraging content representations from advanced
multimodal large language models (MLLMs). To ensure these representations are
well-adapted, alignment with the recommender system is essential. However,
evaluating the alignment of MLLMs for recommendation presents significant
challenges due to three key issues: (1) static benchmarks are inaccurate
because of the dynamism in real-world applications, (2) evaluations with online
system, while accurate, are prohibitively expensive at scale, and (3)
conventional metrics fail to provide actionable insights when learned
representations underperform. To address these challenges, we propose the
Leakage Impact Score (LIS), a novel metric for multimodal recommendation.
Rather than directly assessing MLLMs, LIS efficiently measures the upper bound
of preference data. We also share practical insights on deploying MLLMs with
LIS in real-world scenarios. Online A/B tests on both Content Feed and Display
Ads of Xiaohongshu's Explore Feed production demonstrate the effectiveness of
our proposed method, showing significant improvements in user spent time and
advertiser value.

Abstract: The sequential recommendation system utilizes historical user interactions to
predict preferences. Effectively integrating diverse user behavior patterns
with rich multimodal information of items to enhance the accuracy of sequential
recommendations is an emerging and challenging research direction. This paper
focuses on the problem of multi-modal multi-behavior sequential recommendation,
aiming to address the following challenges: (1) the lack of effective
characterization of modal preferences across different behaviors, as user
attention to different item modalities varies depending on the behavior; (2)
the difficulty of effectively mitigating implicit noise in user behavior, such
as unintended actions like accidental clicks; (3) the inability to handle
modality noise in multi-modal representations, which further impacts the
accurate modeling of user preferences. To tackle these issues, we propose a
novel Multi-Modal Multi-Behavior Sequential Recommendation model (M$^3$BSR).
This model first removes noise in multi-modal representations using a
Conditional Diffusion Modality Denoising Layer. Subsequently, it utilizes deep
behavioral information to guide the denoising of shallow behavioral data,
thereby alleviating the impact of noise in implicit feedback through
Conditional Diffusion Behavior Denoising. Finally, by introducing a
Multi-Expert Interest Extraction Layer, M$^3$BSR explicitly models the common
and specific interests across behaviors and modalities to enhance
recommendation performance. Experimental results indicate that M$^3$BSR
significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on benchmark
datasets.

Result: 研究发现采样策略在分辨率、保真度、鲁棒性和预测能力方面表现不同，揭示了评估结果的扭曲情况。

Conclusion: 研究为选择可靠且鲁棒的离线评估策略提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Offline evaluation plays a central role in benchmarking recommender systems
when online testing is impractical or risky. However, it is susceptible to two
key sources of bias: exposure bias, where users only interact with items they
are shown, and sampling bias, introduced when evaluation is performed on a
subset of logged items rather than the full catalog. While prior work has
proposed methods to mitigate sampling bias, these are typically assessed on
fixed logged datasets rather than for their ability to support reliable model
comparisons under varying exposure conditions or relative to true user
preferences. In this paper, we investigate how different combinations of
logging and sampling choices affect the reliability of offline evaluation.
Using a fully observed dataset as ground truth, we systematically simulate
diverse exposure biases and assess the reliability of common sampling
strategies along four dimensions: sampling resolution (recommender model
separability), fidelity (agreement with full evaluation), robustness (stability
under exposure bias), and predictive power (alignment with ground truth). Our
findings highlight when and how sampling distorts evaluation outcomes and offer
practical guidance for selecting strategies that yield faithful and robust
offline comparisons.

Conclusion: KuaiLive数据集公开可用，推动直播推荐领域的多任务研究。

Abstract: Live streaming platforms have become a dominant form of online content
consumption, offering dynamically evolving content, real-time interactions, and
highly engaging user experiences. These unique characteristics introduce new
challenges that differentiate live streaming recommendation from traditional
recommendation settings and have garnered increasing attention from industry in
recent years. However, research progress in academia has been hindered by the
lack of publicly available datasets that accurately reflect the dynamic nature
of live streaming environments. To address this gap, we introduce KuaiLive, the
first real-time, interactive dataset collected from Kuaishou, a leading live
streaming platform in China with over 400 million daily active users. The
dataset records the interaction logs of 23,772 users and 452,621 streamers over
a 21-day period. Compared to existing datasets, KuaiLive offers several
advantages: it includes precise live room start and end timestamps, multiple
types of real-time user interactions (click, comment, like, gift), and rich
side information features for both users and streamers. These features enable
more realistic simulation of dynamic candidate items and better modeling of
user and streamer behaviors. We conduct a thorough analysis of KuaiLive from
multiple perspectives and evaluate several representative recommendation
methods on it, establishing a strong benchmark for future research. KuaiLive
can support a wide range of tasks in the live streaming domain, such as top-K
recommendation, click-through rate prediction, watch time prediction, and gift
price prediction. Moreover, its fine-grained behavioral data also enables
research on multi-behavior modeling, multi-task learning, and fairness-aware
recommendation. The dataset and related resources are publicly available at

Abstract: In this study, we examine the Federal Reserve's communication strategies
during the COVID-19 pandemic, comparing them with communication during previous
periods of economic stress. Using specialized dictionaries tailored to
COVID-19, unconventional monetary policy (UMP), and financial stability,
combined with sentiment analysis and topic modeling techniques, we identify a
distinct focus in Fed communication during the pandemic on financial stability,
market volatility, social welfare, and UMP, characterized by notable contextual
uncertainty. Through comparative analysis, we juxtapose the Fed's communication
during the COVID-19 crisis with its responses during the dot-com and global
financial crises, examining content, sentiment, and timing dimensions. Our
findings reveal that Fed communication and policy actions were more reactive to
the COVID-19 crisis than to previous crises. Additionally, declining sentiment
related to financial stability in interest rate announcements and minutes
anticipated subsequent accommodative monetary policy decisions. We further
document that communicating about UMP has become the "new normal" for the Fed's
Federal Open Market Committee meeting minutes and Chairman's speeches since the
Global Financial Crisis, reflecting an institutional adaptation in
communication strategy following periods of economic distress. These findings
contribute to our understanding of how central bank communication evolves
during crises and how communication strategies adapt to exceptional economic
circumstances.

Abstract: This study provides an in-depth analysis of time series forecasting methods
to predict the time-dependent deformation trend (also known as creep) of salt
rock under varying confining pressure conditions. Creep deformation assessment
is essential for designing and operating underground storage facilities for
nuclear waste, hydrogen energy, or radioactive materials. Salt rocks, known for
their mechanical properties like low porosity, low permeability, high
ductility, and exceptional creep and self-healing capacities, were examined
using multi-stage triaxial (MSTL) creep data. After resampling, axial strain
datasets were recorded at 5--10 second intervals under confining pressure
levels ranging from 5 to 35 MPa over 5.8--21 days. Initial analyses, including
Seasonal-Trend Decomposition (STL) and Granger causality tests, revealed
minimal seasonality and causality between axial strain and temperature data.
Further statistical tests, such as the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test,
confirmed the stationarity of the data with p-values less than 0.05, and
wavelet coherence plot (WCP) analysis indicated repeating trends. A suite of
deep neural network (DNN) models (Neural Basis Expansion Analysis for Time
Series (N-BEATS), Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN), Recurrent Neural
Networks (RNN), and Transformers (TF)) was utilized and compared against
statistical baseline models. Predictive performance was evaluated using Root
Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Absolute Percentage
Error (MAPE), and Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE). Results
demonstrated that N-BEATS and TCN models outperformed others across various
stress levels, respectively. DNN models, particularly N-BEATS and TCN, showed a
15--20\% improvement in accuracy over traditional analytical models,
effectively capturing complex temporal dependencies and patterns.

model is composed of a speech encoder, a target keyword encoder, and a
detection network. The speech encoder is either a tiny Whisper or a tiny
Conformer. The target keyword encoder is implemented as a hyper-network that
takes the desired keyword as a character string and generates a unique set of
weights for a convolutional layer, which can be considered as a
keyword-specific matched filter. The detection network uses the matched-filter
weights to perform a keyword-specific convolution, which guides the
cross-attention mechanism of a Perceiver module in determining whether the
target term appears in the recording. The results indicate that our system
achieves state-of-the-art detection performance and generalizes effectively to
out-of-domain conditions, including second-language (L2) speech. Notably, our
smallest model, with just 4.2 million parameters, matches or outperforms models
that are several times larger, demonstrating both efficiency and robustness.

Conclusion: 结论表明，多语言预训练和优化框架对低资源语言的语音识别具有潜力，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in handling spoken
inputs for high-resource languages, reaching state-of-the-art performance in
various tasks. However, their applicability is still less explored in
low-resource settings. This work investigates the use of Speech LLMs for
low-resource Automatic Speech Recognition using the SLAM-ASR framework, where a
trainable lightweight projector connects a speech encoder and a LLM. Firstly,
we assess training data volume requirements to match Whisper-only performance,
re-emphasizing the challenges of limited data. Secondly, we show that
leveraging mono- or multilingual projectors pretrained on high-resource
languages reduces the impact of data scarcity, especially with small training
sets. Using multilingual LLMs (EuroLLM, Salamandra) with
whisper-large-v3-turbo, we evaluate performance on several public benchmarks,
providing insights for future research on optimizing Speech LLMs for
low-resource languages and multilinguality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构音障碍语音数据稀缺，现有语音合成技术可能引入偏见，影响辅助技术的发展。

Method: 使用TORGO数据集，评估F5-TTS在语音清晰度、说话人相似性和韵律保留方面的表现，并采用公平性指标分析偏见。

Result: F5-TTS在构音障碍语音合成中更偏向语音清晰度，而非说话人和韵律保留。

Conclusion: 研究为开发更公平、包容的语音技术提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Dysarthric speech poses significant challenges in developing assistive
technologies, primarily due to the limited availability of data. Recent
advances in neural speech synthesis, especially zero-shot voice cloning,
facilitate synthetic speech generation for data augmentation; however, they may
introduce biases towards dysarthric speech. In this paper, we investigate the
effectiveness of state-of-the-art F5-TTS in cloning dysarthric speech using
TORGO dataset, focusing on intelligibility, speaker similarity, and prosody
preservation. We also analyze potential biases using fairness metrics like
Disparate Impact and Parity Difference to assess disparities across dysarthric
severity levels. Results show that F5-TTS exhibits a strong bias toward speech
intelligibility over speaker and prosody preservation in dysarthric speech
synthesis. Insights from this study can help integrate fairness-aware
dysarthric speech synthesis, fostering the advancement of more inclusive speech
technologies.

*Ugur Cetintemel,Shu Chen,Alexander W. Lee,Deepti Raghavan*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: SPEAR是一种语言和运行时系统，旨在通过结构化、自适应和将提示作为执行模型的一等公民来解决现代LLM流程中提示管理的脆弱性和不透明性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代LLM流程中，提示作为核心元素却仍是脆弱且不透明的字符串，与数据流脱节，限制了重用、优化和运行时控制。

Method: SPEAR通过定义提示代数，支持运行时动态修改提示（基于执行信号）和结构化提示管理（版本化视图、内省和日志记录）。

Result: 初步实验量化了不同提示优化模式（手动、辅助、自动）与静态提示和代理重试的比较效果，以及提示级优化（如操作符融合）的影响。

Conclusion: SPEAR通过将提示逻辑视为结构化数据，实现了运行时控制和自动化之间的平衡，并支持多种优化技术。

Abstract: Modern LLM pipelines increasingly resemble data-centric systems: they
retrieve external context, compose intermediate outputs, validate results, and
adapt based on runtime feedback. Yet, the central element guiding this process
-- the prompt -- remains a brittle, opaque string, disconnected from the
surrounding dataflow. This disconnect limits reuse, optimization, and runtime
control.
  In this paper, we describe our vision and an initial design for SPEAR, a
language and runtime that fills this prompt management gap by making prompts
structured, adaptive, and first-class components of the execution model. SPEAR
enables (1) runtime prompt refinement -- modifying prompts dynamically in
response to execution-time signals such as confidence, latency, or missing
context; and (2) structured prompt management -- organizing prompt fragments
into versioned views with support for introspection and logging.
  SPEAR defines a prompt algebra that governs how prompts are constructed and
adapted within a pipeline. It supports multiple refinement modes (manual,
assisted, and automatic), giving developers a balance between control and
automation. By treating prompt logic as structured data, SPEAR enables
optimizations such as operator fusion, prefix caching, and view reuse.
Preliminary experiments quantify the behavior of different refinement modes
compared to static prompts and agentic retries, as well as the impact of
prompt-level optimizations such as operator fusion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有非结构化数据分析系统依赖专家编写代码和管理复杂工作流，成本高且耗时。

Method: 采用反馈驱动规划技术将自然语言查询转换为语义计划，结合多代理协作策略（数据剖析代理、语义交叉验证代理和智能记忆代理）和语义优化模型。

Result: 在三个基准测试中，AgenticData在简单和复杂任务上均表现出卓越的准确性，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AgenticData通过自动化多代理协作和语义优化，有效解决了传统数据分析系统的局限性。

Abstract: Existing unstructured data analytics systems rely on experts to write code
and manage complex analysis workflows, making them both expensive and
time-consuming. To address these challenges, we introduce AgenticData, an
innovative agentic data analytics system that allows users to simply pose
natural language (NL) questions while autonomously analyzing data sources
across multiple domains, including both unstructured and structured data.
First, AgenticData employs a feedback-driven planning technique that
automatically converts an NL query into a semantic plan composed of relational
and semantic operators. We propose a multi-agent collaboration strategy by
utilizing a data profiling agent for discovering relevant data, a semantic
cross-validation agent for iterative optimization based on feedback, and a
smart memory agent for maintaining short-term context and long-term knowledge.
Second, we propose a semantic optimization model to refine and execute semantic
plans effectively. Our system, AgenticData, has been tested using three
benchmarks. Experimental results showed that AgenticData achieved superior
accuracy on both easy and difficult tasks, significantly outperforming
state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Graph clustering is an important algorithmic technique for analysing massive

While the objective of most graph clustering algorithms is to find a vertex set
of low conductance, a sequence of recent studies highlights the importance of
the inter-connection between vertex sets when analysing real-world datasets.
Following this line of research, in this work we study bipartite-like clusters
and present efficient and online sparsification algorithms that find such
clusters in both undirected graphs and directed ones. We conduct experimental
studies on both synthetic and real-world datasets, and show that our algorithms
significantly speedup the running time of existing clustering algorithms while
preserving their effectiveness.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了图感知大型语言模型（LLMs）在对抗攻击下的脆弱性，发现其设计选择影响攻击效果，并提出了防御框架GALGUARD。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs与图数据的结合提升了任务性能，但其对抗攻击的鲁棒性尚未被研究。

Method: 利用现有的图模型对抗攻击方法（如毒化和规避攻击）测试LLAGA和GRAPHPROMPTER，并发现LLAGA的新攻击面。

Result: 发现LLAGA的节点序列模板易受攻击，GRAPHPROMPTER的GNN编码器更鲁棒，但两者均对特征扰动敏感。

Conclusion: 提出GALGUARD防御框架，结合LLM特征校正和GNN防御，有效缓解攻击。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated with
graph-structured data for tasks like node classification, a domain
traditionally dominated by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). While this integration
leverages rich relational information to improve task performance, their
robustness against adversarial attacks remains unexplored. We take the first
step to explore the vulnerabilities of graph-aware LLMs by leveraging existing
adversarial attack methods tailored for graph-based models, including those for
poisoning (training-time attacks) and evasion (test-time attacks), on two
representative models, LLAGA (Chen et al. 2024) and GRAPHPROMPTER (Liu et al.
2024). Additionally, we discover a new attack surface for LLAGA where an
attacker can inject malicious nodes as placeholders into the node sequence
template to severely degrade its performance. Our systematic analysis reveals
that certain design choices in graph encoding can enhance attack success, with
specific findings that: (1) the node sequence template in LLAGA increases its
vulnerability; (2) the GNN encoder used in GRAPHPROMPTER demonstrates greater
robustness; and (3) both approaches remain susceptible to imperceptible feature
perturbation attacks. Finally, we propose an end-to-end defense framework
GALGUARD, that combines an LLM-based feature correction module to mitigate
feature-level perturbations and adapted GNN defenses to protect against
structural attacks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用大型语言模型（LLM）进行网络安全事件响应规划的新方法，通过微调、信息检索和前瞻性规划减少幻觉，并在实验中表现出优于前沿LLM的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于前沿LLM的事件响应方法成本高且易产生幻觉，亟需一种更高效、可靠的方法来辅助安全操作员。

Method: 方法包括三个步骤：微调LLM、信息检索和前瞻性规划，确保生成的响应计划幻觉概率可控。

Result: 实验表明，该方法恢复时间比前沿LLM缩短22%，且能泛化到多种事件类型和响应动作。

Conclusion: 该方法轻量级且可在普通硬件上运行，为事件响应提供了一种高效且可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Timely and effective incident response is key to managing the growing
frequency of cyberattacks. However, identifying the right response actions for
complex systems is a major technical challenge. A promising approach to
mitigate this challenge is to use the security knowledge embedded in large
language models (LLMs) to assist security operators during incident handling.
Recent research has demonstrated the potential of this approach, but current
methods are mainly based on prompt engineering of frontier LLMs, which is
costly and prone to hallucinations. We address these limitations by presenting
a novel way to use an LLM for incident response planning with reduced
hallucination. Our method includes three steps: fine-tuning, information
retrieval, and lookahead planning. We prove that our method generates response
plans with a bounded probability of hallucination and that this probability can
be made arbitrarily small at the expense of increased planning time under
certain assumptions. Moreover, we show that our method is lightweight and can
run on commodity hardware. We evaluate our method on logs from incidents
reported in the literature. The experimental results show that our method a)
achieves up to 22% shorter recovery times than frontier LLMs and b) generalizes
to a broad range of incident types and response actions.

Conclusion: 该框架成功整合了数据驱动算法与经典过程控制，为分布式控制和优化提供了新途径。

Abstract: Most recent advances in machine learning and analytics for process control
pose the question of how to naturally integrate new data-driven methods with
classical process models and control. We propose a process modeling framework
enabling integration of data-driven algorithms through consistent topological
properties and conservation of extensive quantities. Interconnections among
process network units are represented through connectivity matrices and network
graphs. We derive the system's natural objective function equivalent to the
non-equilibrium entropy production in a steady state system as a driving force
for the process dynamics. We illustrate how distributed control and
optimization can be implemented into process network structures and how control
laws and algorithms alter the system's natural equilibrium towards engineered
objectives. The basic requirement is that the flow conditions can be expressed
in terms of conic sector (passivity) conditions. Our formalism allows
integration of fundamental conservation properties from topology with learned
dynamic relations from data through sparse deep neural networks.
  We demonstrate in a practical example of a simple inventory control system
how to integrate the basic topology of a process with a neural network ordinary
differential equation model. The system specific constitutive equations are
left undescribed and learned by the neural ordinary differential equation
algorithm using the adjoint method in combination with an adaptive ODE solver
from synthetic time-series data. The resulting neural network forms a state
space model for use in e.g. a model predictive control algorithm.

Motivation: 解决在线公平分配问题中近似EFX分配的不可行性，探索预测辅助算法的潜力。

Method: 利用预测向量估计代理人真实估值，结合真实值设计算法，特别针对两代理人同质估值情况。

Result: 证明忽略或完全依赖预测的算法无法实现近似EFX，提出一种算法在预测准确时表现良好。

Conclusion: 在线EFX分配具有挑战性，预测辅助算法在特定条件下可能有效。

Abstract: We study an online fair division problem where a fixed number of goods arrive
sequentially and must be allocated to a given set of agents. Once a good
arrives, its true value for each agent is revealed, and it has to be
immediately and irrevocably allocated to some agent. The ultimate goal is to
ensure envy-freeness up to any good (EFX) after all goods have been allocated.
Unfortunately, as we show, approximate EFX allocations are unattainable in
general, even under restrictive assumptions on the valuation functions.
  To address this, we follow a recent and fruitful trend of augmenting
algorithms with predictions. Specifically, we assume access to a prediction
vector estimating the agents' true valuations -- e.g., generated by a machine
learning model trained on past data. Predictions may be unreliable, and we
measure their error using the total variation distance from the true
valuations, that is, the percentage of predicted value-mass that disagrees with
the true values.
  Focusing on the natural class of additive valuations, we prove impossibility
results even on approximate EFX allocations for algorithms that either ignore
predictions or rely solely on them. We then turn to algorithms that use both
the predictions and the true values and show strong lower bounds on the
prediction accuracy that is required by any algorithm to compute an approximate
EFX. These negative results persist even under identical valuations, contrary
to the offline setting where exact EFX allocations always exist without the
necessity of predictions. We then present an algorithm for two agents with
identical valuations that uses effectively the predictions and the true values.
The algorithm approximates EFX, with its guarantees improving as the accuracy
of the predictions increases.

Conclusion: LLMs是强大的追溯发现工具，但需结合人工干预和任务框架优化以提升性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new potential for automating
documentation-to-code traceability, yet their capabilities remain
underexplored. We present a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs (Claude 3.5
Sonnet, GPT-4o, and o3-mini) in establishing trace links between various
software documentation (including API references and user guides) and source
code. We create two novel datasets from two open-source projects (Unity Catalog
and Crawl4AI). Through systematic experiments, we assess three key
capabilities: (1) trace link identification accuracy, (2) relationship
explanation quality, and (3) multi-step chain reconstruction. Results show that
the best-performing LLM achieves F1-scores of 79.4% and 80.4% across the two
datasets, substantially outperforming our baselines (TF-IDF, BM25, and
CodeBERT). While fully correct relationship explanations range from 42.9% to
71.1%, partial accuracy exceeds 97%, indicating that fundamental connections
are rarely missed. For multi-step chains, LLMs maintain high endpoint accuracy
but vary in capturing precise intermediate links. Error analysis reveals that
many false positives stem from naming-based assumptions, phantom links, or
overgeneralization of architectural patterns. We demonstrate that task-framing,
such as a one-to-many matching strategy, is critical for performance. These
findings position LLMs as powerful assistants for trace discovery, but their
limitations could necessitate human-in-the-loop tool design and highlight
specific error patterns for future research.

Abstract: Software libraries are central to the functionality, security, and
maintainability of modern code. As developers increasingly turn to Large
Language Models (LLMs) to assist with programming tasks, understanding how
these models recommend libraries is essential. In this paper, we conduct an
empirical study of six state-of-the-art LLMs, both proprietary and open-source,
by prompting them to solve real-world Python problems sourced from Stack
Overflow. We analyze the types of libraries they import, the characteristics of
those libraries, and the extent to which the recommendations are usable out of
the box. Our results show that LLMs predominantly favour third-party libraries
over standard ones, and often recommend mature, popular, and permissively
licensed dependencies. However, we also identify gaps in usability: 4.6% of the
libraries could not be resolved automatically due to structural mismatches
between import names and installable packages, and only two models (out of six)
provided installation guidance. While the generated code is technically valid,
the lack of contextual support places the burden of manually resolving
dependencies on the user. Our findings offer actionable insights for both
developers and researchers, and highlight opportunities to improve the
reliability and usability of LLM-generated code in the context of software
dependencies.

Abstract: Logging is essential in software development, helping developers monitor
system behavior and aiding in debugging applications. Given the ability of
large language models (LLMs) to generate natural language and code, researchers
are exploring their potential to generate log statements. However, prior work
focuses on evaluating logs introduced in code functions, leaving file-level log
generation underexplored -- especially in machine learning (ML) applications,
where comprehensive logging can enhance reliability. In this study, we evaluate
the capacity of GPT-4o mini as a case study to generate log statements for ML
projects at file level. We gathered a set of 171 ML repositories containing
4,073 Python files with at least one log statement. We identified and removed
the original logs from the files, prompted the LLM to generate logs for them,
and evaluated both the position of the logs and log level, variables, and text
quality of the generated logs compared to human-written logs. In addition, we
manually analyzed a representative sample of generated logs to identify common
patterns and challenges. We find that the LLM introduces logs in the same place
as humans in 63.91% of cases, but at the cost of a high overlogging rate of
82.66%. Furthermore, our manual analysis reveals challenges for file-level
logging, which shows overlogging at the beginning or end of a function,
difficulty logging within large code blocks, and misalignment with
project-specific logging conventions. While the LLM shows promise for
generating logs for complete files, these limitations remain to be addressed
for practical implementation.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has significantly advanced code generation for
large language models (LLMs). However, current paradigms rely on outcome-based
rewards from test cases, neglecting the quality of the intermediate reasoning
process. While supervising the reasoning process directly is a promising
direction, it is highly susceptible to reward hacking, where the policy model
learns to exploit the reasoning reward signal without improving final outcomes.
To address this, we introduce a unified framework that can effectively
incorporate the quality of the reasoning process during RL. First, to enable
reasoning evaluation, we develop LCB-RB, a benchmark comprising preference
pairs of superior and inferior reasoning processes. Second, to accurately score
reasoning quality, we introduce an Optimized-Degraded based (OD-based) method
for reward model training. This method generates high-quality preference pairs
by systematically optimizing and degrading initial reasoning paths along
curated dimensions of reasoning quality, such as factual accuracy, logical
rigor, and coherence. A 7B parameter reward model with this method achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on LCB-RB and generalizes well to other
benchmarks. Finally, we introduce Posterior-GRPO (P-GRPO), a novel RL method
that conditions process-based rewards on task success. By selectively applying
rewards to the reasoning processes of only successful outcomes, P-GRPO
effectively mitigates reward hacking and aligns the model's internal reasoning
with final code correctness. A 7B parameter model with P-GRPO achieves superior
performance across diverse code generation tasks, outperforming outcome-only
baselines by 4.5%, achieving comparable performance to GPT-4-Turbo. We further
demonstrate the generalizability of our approach by extending it to
mathematical tasks. Our models, dataset, and code are publicly available.

Abstract: Attention mechanisms are at the core of modern neural architectures, powering
systems ranging from ChatGPT to autonomous vehicles and driving a major
economic impact. However, high-profile failures, such as ChatGPT's nonsensical
outputs or Google's suspension of Gemini's image generation due to attention
weight errors, highlight a critical gap: existing deep learning fault
taxonomies might not adequately capture the unique failures introduced by
attention mechanisms. This gap leaves practitioners without actionable
diagnostic guidance. To address this gap, we present the first comprehensive
empirical study of faults in attention-based neural networks (ABNNs). Our work
is based on a systematic analysis of 555 real-world faults collected from 96
projects across ten frameworks, including GitHub, Hugging Face, and Stack
Overflow. Through our analysis, we develop a novel taxonomy comprising seven
attention-specific fault categories, not captured by existing work. Our results
show that over half of the ABNN faults arise from mechanisms unique to
attention architectures. We further analyze the root causes and manifestations
of these faults through various symptoms. Finally, by analyzing symptom-root
cause associations, we identify four evidence-based diagnostic heuristics that
explain 33.0% of attention-specific faults, offering the first systematic
diagnostic guidance for attention-based models.

Motivation: 解决传统软件现代化过程中面临的隐式合约、性能保持和集成演进等挑战，推动软件系统向持续自适应且可控的“Software 3.0”发展。

Method: 使用类型化有向图表示软件工件，通过SLMs驱动的突变操作符和多目标适应性选择实现自动化演进。

Result: 在三个基准测试中，修复83%的安全漏洞，COBOL转Java功能等效性达93%，文档更新延迟小于两分钟，延迟降低40%，功能交付时间缩短7倍。

Conclusion: EvoGraph为软件现代化提供了一种高效、可控的解决方案，展示了向自适应系统演进的实际路径。

Abstract: We introduce **EvoGraph**, a framework that enables software systems to
evolve their own source code, build pipelines, documentation, and tickets.
EvoGraph represents every artefact in a typed directed graph, applies learned
mutation operators driven by specialized small language models (SLMs), and
selects survivors with a multi-objective fitness. On three benchmarks, EvoGraph
fixes 83% of known security vulnerabilities, translates COBOL to Java with 93%
functional equivalence (test verified), and maintains documentation freshness
within two minutes. Experiments show a 40% latency reduction and a sevenfold
drop in feature lead time compared with strong baselines. We extend our
approach to **evoGraph**, leveraging language-specific SLMs for modernizing
.NET, Lisp, CGI, ColdFusion, legacy Python, and C codebases, achieving 82-96%
semantic equivalence across languages while reducing computational costs by 90%
compared to large language models. EvoGraph's design responds to empirical
failure modes in legacy modernization, such as implicit contracts, performance
preservation, and integration evolution. Our results suggest a practical path
toward Software 3.0, where systems adapt continuously yet remain under
measurable control.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种半自动化方法，利用两个机器学习模型帮助开发者提前识别软件变更间的依赖关系，以减少构建失败和部署问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着软件系统复杂度的增加，准确识别和管理变更间的依赖关系变得至关重要，尤其是在跨团队和多组件的环境中。

Method: 通过初步研究OpenStack中的依赖管理，提出了两个ML模型：一个预测变更间依赖的可能性，另一个识别具体的依赖变更对。

Result: 模型表现良好，平均AUC分数分别为79.33%和91.89%，Brier分数为0.11和0.014。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效帮助开发者提前识别依赖关系，减少延迟和构建失败。

Abstract: As software systems grow in complexity, accurately identifying and managing
dependencies among changes becomes increasingly critical. For instance, a
change that leverages a function must depend on the change that introduces it.
Establishing such dependencies allows CI/CD pipelines to build and orchestrate
changes effectively, preventing build failures and incomplete feature
deployments. In modern software systems, dependencies often span multiple
components across teams, creating challenges for development and deployment.
They serve various purposes, from enabling new features to managing
configurations, and can even involve traditionally independent changes like
documentation updates. To address these challenges, we conducted a preliminary
study on dependency management in OpenStack, a large-scale software system. Our
study revealed that a substantial portion of software changes in OpenStack over
the past 10 years are interdependent. Surprisingly, 51.08% of these
dependencies are identified during the code review phase-after a median delay
of 5.06 hours-rather than at the time of change creation. Developers often
spend a median of 57.12 hours identifying dependencies, searching among a
median of 463 other changes. To help developers proactively identify
dependencies, we propose a semi-automated approach that leverages two ML
models. The first model predicts the likelihood of dependencies among changes,
while the second identifies the exact pairs of dependent changes. Our proposed
models demonstrate strong performance, achieving average AUC scores of 79.33%
and 91.89%, and Brier scores of 0.11 and 0.014, respectively. Indeed, the
second model has a good top-k recall across all types of pairs, while the top-k
precision has room for improvement.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的感知-采样-压缩框架，用于改进3D高斯泼溅技术，解决了大规模场景管理和高效存储的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D高斯泼溅技术在大规模场景管理和存储效率上存在不足，尤其是在复杂环境或有限计算资源下。

Method: 提出了场景感知补偿算法、金字塔采样表示和广义高斯混合模型压缩算法。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提高了内存效率和视觉质量，同时保持实时渲染速度。

Conclusion: 新框架有效解决了3D高斯泼溅技术的存储和效率问题，同时提升了视觉质量。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in real-time and photorealistic novel view synthesis. However,
traditional 3DGS representations often struggle with large-scale scene
management and efficient storage, particularly when dealing with complex
environments or limited computational resources. To address these limitations,
we introduce a novel perceive-sample-compress framework for 3D Gaussian
Splatting. Specifically, we propose a scene perception compensation algorithm
that intelligently refines Gaussian parameters at each level. This algorithm
intelligently prioritizes visual importance for higher fidelity rendering in
critical areas, while optimizing resource usage and improving overall visible
quality. Furthermore, we propose a pyramid sampling representation to manage
Gaussian primitives across hierarchical levels. Finally, to facilitate
efficient storage of proposed hierarchical pyramid representations, we develop
a Generalized Gaussian Mixed model compression algorithm to achieve significant
compression ratios without sacrificing visual fidelity. The extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves memory
efficiency and high visual quality while maintaining real-time rendering speed.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合显隐式函数的动态3D高斯泼溅框架，解决了现有方法在动态场景中的过平滑或特征碰撞问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态3DGS方法在保留运动细节和变形一致性之间存在频谱冲突，导致过平滑或特征碰撞。

Method: 采用混合显隐式函数，包括频谱感知的拉普拉斯编码架构、增强的高斯动态属性和自适应高斯分割策略。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在复杂动态场景重建中表现优异，具有更高的重建保真度。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了动态3DGS的频谱冲突问题，实现了更好的动态场景建模效果。

Abstract: While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) excels in static scene modeling, its
extension to dynamic scenes introduces significant challenges. Existing dynamic
3DGS methods suffer from either over-smoothing due to low-rank decomposition or
feature collision from high-dimensional grid sampling. This is because of the
inherent spectral conflicts between preserving motion details and maintaining
deformation consistency at different frequency. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel dynamic 3DGS framework with hybrid explicit-implicit functions.
Our approach contains three key innovations: a spectral-aware Laplacian
encoding architecture which merges Hash encoding and Laplacian-based module for
flexible frequency motion control, an enhanced Gaussian dynamics attribute that
compensates for photometric distortions caused by geometric deformation, and an
adaptive Gaussian split strategy guided by KDTree-based primitive control to
efficiently query and optimize dynamic areas. Through extensive experiments,
our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in reconstructing complex
dynamic scenes, achieving better reconstruction fidelity.

Method: 引入混合注意力机制和静态-动态训练推理范式，避免显式运动监督。

Result: 实验表明RAP在实时约束下达到最佳性能。

Conclusion: RAP在保持高质量的同时满足了实时性需求。

Abstract: Audio-driven portrait animation aims to synthesize realistic and natural
talking head videos from an input audio signal and a single reference image.
While existing methods achieve high-quality results by leveraging
high-dimensional intermediate representations and explicitly modeling motion
dynamics, their computational complexity renders them unsuitable for real-time
deployment. Real-time inference imposes stringent latency and memory
constraints, often necessitating the use of highly compressed latent
representations. However, operating in such compact spaces hinders the
preservation of fine-grained spatiotemporal details, thereby complicating
audio-visual synchronization RAP (Real-time Audio-driven Portrait animation), a
unified framework for generating high-quality talking portraits under real-time
constraints. Specifically, RAP introduces a hybrid attention mechanism for
fine-grained audio control, and a static-dynamic training-inference paradigm
that avoids explicit motion supervision. Through these techniques, RAP achieves
precise audio-driven control, mitigates long-term temporal drift, and maintains
high visual fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAP achieves
state-of-the-art performance while operating under real-time constraints.

Conclusion: Voost通过联合学习和推理技术，显著提升了虚拟试穿和试脱的性能和灵活性。

Abstract: Virtual try-on aims to synthesize a realistic image of a person wearing a
target garment, but accurately modeling garment-body correspondence remains a
persistent challenge, especially under pose and appearance variation. In this
paper, we propose Voost - a unified and scalable framework that jointly learns
virtual try-on and try-off with a single diffusion transformer. By modeling
both tasks jointly, Voost enables each garment-person pair to supervise both
directions and supports flexible conditioning over generation direction and
garment category, enhancing garment-body relational reasoning without
task-specific networks, auxiliary losses, or additional labels. In addition, we
introduce two inference-time techniques: attention temperature scaling for
robustness to resolution or mask variation, and self-corrective sampling that
leverages bidirectional consistency between tasks. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Voost achieves state-of-the-art results on both try-on and
try-off benchmarks, consistently outperforming strong baselines in alignment
accuracy, visual fidelity, and generalization.

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting has rapidly emerged as a transformative technique for
real-time 3D scene representation, offering a highly efficient and expressive
alternative to Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). Its ability to render complex
scenes with high fidelity has enabled progress across domains such as scene
reconstruction, robotics, and interactive content creation. More recently, the
integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) and language embeddings into
Gaussian Splatting pipelines has opened new possibilities for text-conditioned
generation, editing, and semantic scene understanding. Despite these advances,
a comprehensive overview of this emerging intersection has been lacking. This
survey presents a structured review of current research efforts that combine
language guidance with 3D Gaussian Splatting, detailing theoretical
foundations, integration strategies, and real-world use cases. We highlight key
limitations such as computational bottlenecks, generalizability, and the
scarcity of semantically annotated 3D Gaussian data and outline open challenges
and future directions for advancing language-guided 3D scene understanding

Conclusion: 新方法通过改进密度控制和点云初始化，显著提升了3DGS的性能。

Abstract: Achieving high-quality novel view synthesis in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
often depends on effective point primitive management. The underlying Adaptive
Density Control (ADC) process addresses this issue by automating densification
and pruning. Yet, the vanilla 3DGS densification strategy shows key
shortcomings. To address this issue, in this paper we introduce a novel density
control method, which exploits the volumes of inertia associated to each
Gaussian function to guide the refinement process. Furthermore, we study the
effect of both traditional Structure from Motion (SfM) and Deep Image Matching
(DIM) methods for point cloud initialization. Extensive experimental
evaluations on the Mip-NeRF 360 dataset demonstrate that our approach surpasses
3DGS in reconstruction quality, delivering encouraging performance across
diverse scenes.

Conclusion: 新方法为衣物建模提供了更准确的分割策略，解决了多层重叠问题。

Abstract: 3D Cloth modeling and simulation is essential for avatars creation in several
fields, such as fashion, entertainment, and animation. Achieving high-quality
results is challenging due to the large variability of clothed body especially
in the generation of realistic wrinkles. 3D scan acquisitions provide more
accuracy in the representation of real-world objects but lack semantic
information that can be inferred with a reliable semantic reconstruction
pipeline. To this aim, shape segmentation plays a crucial role in identifying
the semantic shape parts. However, current 3D shape segmentation methods are
designed for scene understanding and interpretation and only few work is
devoted to modeling. In the context of clothed body modeling the segmentation
is a preliminary step for fully semantic shape parts reconstruction namely the
underlying body and the involved garments. These parts represent several layers
with strong overlap in contrast with standard segmentation methods that provide
disjoint sets. In this work we propose a new 3D point cloud segmentation
paradigm where each 3D point can be simultaneously associated to different
layers. In this fashion we can estimate the underlying body parts and the
unseen clothed regions, i.e., the part of a cloth occluded by the clothed-layer
above. We name this segmentation paradigm clothed human layering. We create a
new synthetic dataset that simulates very realistic 3D scans with the ground
truth of the involved clothing layers. We propose and evaluate different neural
network settings to deal with 3D clothing layering. We considered both coarse
and fine grained per-layer garment identification. Our experiments demonstrates
the benefit in introducing proper strategies for the segmentation on the
garment domain on both the synthetic and real-world scan datasets.

Conclusion: 该方法为真实场景的光照编辑提供了物理精确且逼真的解决方案。

Abstract: We present a self-supervised approach to in-the-wild image relighting that
enables fully controllable, physically based illumination editing. We achieve
this by combining the physical accuracy of traditional rendering with the
photorealistic appearance made possible by neural rendering. Our pipeline works
by inferring a colored mesh representation of a given scene using monocular
estimates of geometry and intrinsic components. This representation allows
users to define their desired illumination configuration in 3D. The scene under
the new lighting can then be rendered using a path-tracing engine. We send this
approximate rendering of the scene through a feed-forward neural renderer to
predict the final photorealistic relighting result. We develop a differentiable
rendering process to reconstruct in-the-wild scene illumination, enabling
self-supervised training of our neural renderer on raw image collections. Our
method represents a significant step in bringing the explicit physical control
over lights available in typical 3D computer graphics tools, such as Blender,
to in-the-wild relighting.

Abstract: We break the mold in flow-based generative modeling by proposing a new model
based on the damped wave equation, also known as telegrapher's equation.
Similar to the diffusion equation and Brownian motion, there is a Feynman-Kac
type relation between the telegrapher's equation and the stochastic Kac process
in 1D. The Kac flow evolves stepwise linearly in time, so that the probability
flow is Lipschitz continuous in the Wasserstein distance and, in contrast to
diffusion flows, the norm of the velocity is globally bounded. Furthermore, the
Kac model has the diffusion model as its asymptotic limit. We extend these
considerations to a multi-dimensional stochastic process which consists of
independent 1D Kac processes in each spatial component. We show that this
process gives rise to an absolutely continuous curve in the Wasserstein space
and compute the conditional velocity field starting in a Dirac point
analytically. Using the framework of flow matching, we train a neural network
that approximates the velocity field and use it for sample generation. Our
numerical experiments demonstrate the scalability of our approach, and show its
advantages over diffusion models.

Result: 在RNA预测任务中，CodonMoE显著提升性能，参数减少80%，达到最优结果。

Conclusion: CodonMoE为统一基因组语言建模提供了高效路径，减少计算开销并保持性能优势。

Abstract: Genomic language models (gLMs) face a fundamental efficiency challenge:
either maintain separate specialized models for each biological modality (DNA
and RNA) or develop large multi-modal architectures. Both approaches impose
significant computational burdens - modality-specific models require redundant
infrastructure despite inherent biological connections, while multi-modal
architectures demand massive parameter counts and extensive cross-modality
pretraining. To address this limitation, we introduce CodonMoE (Adaptive
Mixture of Codon Reformative Experts), a lightweight adapter that transforms
DNA language models into effective RNA analyzers without RNA-specific
pretraining. Our theoretical analysis establishes CodonMoE as a universal
approximator at the codon level, capable of mapping arbitrary functions from
codon sequences to RNA properties given sufficient expert capacity. Across four
RNA prediction tasks spanning stability, expression, and regulation, DNA models
augmented with CodonMoE significantly outperform their unmodified counterparts,
with HyenaDNA+CodonMoE series achieving state-of-the-art results using 80%
fewer parameters than specialized RNA models. By maintaining sub-quadratic
complexity while achieving superior performance, our approach provides a
principled path toward unifying genomic language modeling, leveraging more
abundant DNA data and reducing computational overhead while preserving
modality-specific performance advantages.

Abstract: Modern disease classification often overlooks molecular commonalities hidden
beneath divergent clinical presentations. This study introduces a
transcriptomics-driven framework for discovering disease relationships by
analyzing over 1300 disease-condition pairs using GenoMAS, a fully automated
agentic AI system. Beyond identifying robust gene-level overlaps, we develop a
novel pathway-based similarity framework that integrates multi-database
enrichment analysis to quantify functional convergence across diseases. The
resulting disease similarity network reveals both known comorbidities and
previously undocumented cross-category links. By examining shared biological
pathways, we explore potential molecular mechanisms underlying these
connections-offering functional hypotheses that go beyond symptom-based
taxonomies. We further show how background conditions such as obesity and
hypertension modulate transcriptomic similarity, and identify therapeutic
repurposing opportunities for rare diseases like autism spectrum disorder based
on their molecular proximity to better-characterized conditions. In addition,
this work demonstrates how biologically grounded agentic AI can scale
transcriptomic analysis while enabling mechanistic interpretation across
complex disease landscapes. All results are publicly accessible at

Abstract: Cell type annotation is a fundamental step in the analysis of single-cell RNA
sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. In practice, human experts often rely on the
structure revealed by principal component analysis (PCA) followed by
$k$-nearest neighbor ($k$-NN) graph construction to guide annotation. While
effective, this process is labor-intensive and does not scale to large
datasets. Recent advances in CLIP-style models offer a promising path toward
automating cell type annotation. By aligning scRNA-seq profiles with natural
language descriptions, models like LangCell enable zero-shot annotation. While
LangCell demonstrates decent zero-shot performance, its predictions remain
suboptimal, particularly in achieving consistent accuracy across all cell
types. In this paper, we propose to refine the zero-shot logits produced by
LangCell through a graph-regularized optimization framework. By enforcing local
consistency over the task-specific PCA-based k-NN graph, our method combines
the scalability of the pre-trained models with the structural robustness relied
upon in expert annotation. We evaluate our approach on 14 annotated human
scRNA-seq datasets from 4 distinct studies, spanning 11 organs and over 200,000
single cells. Our method consistently improves zero-shot annotation accuracy,
achieving accuracy gains of up to 10%. Further analysis showcase the mechanism
by which GRIT effectively propagates correct signals through the graph, pulling
back mislabeled cells toward more accurate predictions. The method is
training-free, model-agnostic, and serves as a simple yet effective plug-in for
enhancing automated cell type annotation in practice.

Abstract: Large pre-trained DNA language models such as DNABERT-2, Nucleotide
Transformer, and HyenaDNA have demonstrated strong performance on various
genomic benchmarks. However, most applications rely on expensive fine-tuning,
which works best when the training and test data share a similar distribution.
In this work, we investigate whether task-specific fine-tuning is always
necessary. We show that simple embedding-based pipelines that extract fixed
representations from these models and feed them into lightweight classifiers
can achieve competitive performance. In evaluation settings with different data
distributions, embedding-based methods often outperform fine-tuning while
reducing inference time by 10x to 20x. Our results suggest that embedding
extraction is not only a strong baseline but also a more generalizable and
efficient alternative to fine-tuning, especially for deployment in diverse or
unseen genomic contexts. For example, in enhancer classification, HyenaDNA
embeddings combined with zCurve achieve 0.68 accuracy (vs. 0.58 for
fine-tuning), with an 88% reduction in inference time and over 8x lower carbon
emissions (0.02 kg vs. 0.17 kg CO2). In non-TATA promoter classification,
DNABERT-2 embeddings with zCurve or GC content reach 0.85 accuracy (vs. 0.89
with fine-tuning) with a 22x lower carbon footprint (0.02 kg vs. 0.44 kg CO2).
These results show that embedding-based pipelines offer over 10x better carbon

Abstract: The utilization of radio frequency (RF) signals for wireless sensing has
garnered increasing attention. However, the radio environment is unpredictable
and often unfavorable, the sensing accuracy of traditional RF sensing methods
is often affected by adverse propagation channels from the transmitter to the
receiver, such as fading and noise. In this paper, we propose employing
distributed Reconfigurable Intelligent Metasurface Antennas (RIMSA) to detect
the presence and location of objects where multiple RIMSA receivers (RIMSA Rxs)
are deployed on different places. By programming their beamforming patterns,
RIMSA Rxs can enhance the quality of received signals. The RF sensing problem
is modeled as a joint optimization problem of beamforming pattern and mapping
of received signals to sensing outcomes. To address this challenge, we
introduce a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm aimed at calculating
the optimal beamforming patterns and a neural network aimed at converting
received signals into sensing outcomes. In addition, the malicious attacker may
potentially launch jamming attack to disrupt sensing process. To enable
effective sensing in interferenceprone environment, we devise a combined loss
function that takes into account the Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio
(SINR) of the received signals. The simulation results show that the proposed
distributed RIMSA system can achieve more efficient sensing performance and
better overcome environmental influences than centralized implementation.
Furthermore, the introduced method ensures high-accuracy sensing performance
even under jamming attack.

Abstract: Accurate numerical integration over non-uniform point clouds is a challenge
for modern mesh-free machine learning solvers for partial differential
equations (PDEs) using variational principles. While standard Monte Carlo (MC)
methods are not capable of handling a non-uniform point cloud, modern neural
network architectures can deal with permutation-invariant inputs, creating
quadrature rules for any point cloud. In this work, we introduce QuadrANN, a
Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture designed to learn optimal quadrature
weights directly from the underlying geometry of point clouds. The design of
the model exploits a deep message-passing scheme where the initial layer
encodes rich local geometric features from absolute and relative positions as
well as an explicit local density measure. In contrast, the following layers
incorporate a global context vector. These architectural choices allow the
QuadrANN to generate a data-driven quadrature rule that is
permutation-invariant and adaptive to both local point density and the overall
domain shape. We test our methodology on a series of challenging test cases,
including integration on convex and non-convex domains and estimating the
solution of the Heat and Fokker-Planck equations. Across all the tests,
QuadrANN reduces the variance of the integral estimation compared to standard
Quasi-Monte Carlo methods by warping the point clouds to be more dense in
critical areas where the integrands present certain singularities. This
enhanced stability in critical areas of the domain at hand is critical for the
optimization of energy functionals, leading to improved deep learning-based
variational solvers.

Abstract: Augmentation technologies are undergoing a process of enculturation due to
many factors, one being the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), or what the
World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) terms the AI wave or AI boom.
Chapter 3 focuses critical attention on the hyped assumption that
sophisticated, emergent, and embodied augmentation technologies will improve
lives, literacy, cultures, arts, economies, and social contexts. The chapter
begins by discussing the problem of ambiguity with AI terminology, which it
aids with a description of the WIPO Categorization of AI Technologies Scheme.
It then draws on media and communication studies to explore concepts such as
agents, agency, power, and agentive relationships between humans and robots.
The chapter focuses on the development of non-human agents in industry as a
critical factor in the rise of augmentation technologies. It looks at how
marketing communication enculturates future users to adopt and adapt to the
technology. Scholars are charting the significant ways that people are drawn
further into commercial digital landscapes, such as the Metaverse concept, in
post-internet society. It concludes by examining recent claims concerning the
Metaverse and augmented reality.

Abstract: There has been rapid development in generative AI tools across the education
sector, which in turn is leading to increased adoption by teachers. However,
this raises concerns regarding the safety and age-appropriateness of the
AI-generated content that is being created for use in classrooms. This paper
explores Oak National Academy's approach to addressing these concerns within
the development of the UK Government's first publicly available generative AI
tool - our AI-powered lesson planning assistant (Aila). Aila is intended to
support teachers planning national curriculum-aligned lessons that are
appropriate for pupils aged 5-16 years. To mitigate safety risks associated
with AI-generated content we have implemented four key safety guardrails - (1)
prompt engineering to ensure AI outputs are generated within pedagogically
sound and curriculum-aligned parameters, (2) input threat detection to mitigate
attacks, (3) an Independent Asynchronous Content Moderation Agent (IACMA) to
assess outputs against predefined safety categories, and (4) taking a
human-in-the-loop approach, to encourage teachers to review generated content
before it is used in the classroom. Through our on-going evaluation of these
safety guardrails we have identified several challenges and opportunities to
take into account when implementing and testing safety guardrails. This paper
highlights ways to build more effective safety guardrails in generative AI
education tools including the on-going iteration and refinement of guardrails,
as well as enabling cross-sector collaboration through sharing both open-source
code, datasets and learnings.

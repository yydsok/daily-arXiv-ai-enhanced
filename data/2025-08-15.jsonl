Traditional synchronisation-based systems perform well under clean\nconditions but degrade sharply in first-person recordings. Conversely,\nface-voice association (FVA)-based methods forgo synchronisation modelling in\nfavour of cross-modal biometric matching, exhibiting robustness to transient\nvisual corruption but suffering when overlapping speech or front-end\nsegmentation errors occur. In this paper, a simple yet effective ensemble\napproach is proposed to fuse synchronisation-dependent and\nsynchronisation-agnostic model outputs via weighted averaging, thereby\nharnessing complementary cues without introducing complex fusion architectures.\nA refined preprocessing pipeline for the FVA-based component is also introduced\nto optimise ensemble integration. Experiments on the Ego4D-AVD validation set\ndemonstrate that the ensemble attains 70.2% and 66.7% mean Average Precision\n(mAP) with TalkNet and Light-ASD backbones, respectively.

We demonstrate that this\nsynthetic corpus enables effective Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of\nVLMs and substantially boosts the performance of state-of-the-art object\ndetectors such as YOLO and DETR. Notably, in the absence of synthetic data\n(SynSpill dataset), VLMs still generalize better to unseen spill scenarios than\nthese detectors. When SynSpill is used, both VLMs and detectors achieve marked\nimprovements, with their performance becoming comparable.\n  Our results underscore that high-fidelity synthetic data is a powerful means\nto bridge the domain gap in safety-critical applications. The combination of\nsynthetic generation and lightweight adaptation offers a cost-effective,\nscalable pathway for deploying vision systems in industrial environments where\nreal data is scarce/impractical to obtain.\n  Project Page: https://synspill.vercel.app"}

To address this limitation, we propose\ntwo approaches for allocating the KL divergence threshold across agents:\nHATRPO-W, a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker-based (KKT-based) method that optimizes\nthreshold assignment under global KL constraints, and HATRPO-G, a greedy\nalgorithm that prioritizes agents based on improvement-to-divergence ratio.

While\nthis advantage makes Mamba particularly promising for resource-constrained edge\ndevices, no hardware acceleration frameworks are currently optimized for\ndeploying it in such environments. This paper presents eMamba, a comprehensive\nend-to-end hardware acceleration framework explicitly designed for deploying\nMamba models on edge platforms. eMamba maximizes computational efficiency by\nreplacing complex normalization layers with lightweight hardware-aware\nalternatives and approximating expensive operations, such as SiLU activation\nand exponentiation, considering the target applications. Then, it performs an\napproximation-aware neural architecture search (NAS) to tune the learnable\nparameters used during approximation. Evaluations with Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10,\nand MARS, an open-source human pose estimation dataset, show eMamba achieves\ncomparable accuracy to state-of-the-art techniques using 1.63-19.9$\\times$\nfewer parameters. In addition, it generalizes well to large-scale natural\nlanguage tasks, demonstrating stable perplexity across varying sequence lengths\non the WikiText2 dataset. We also quantize and implement the entire eMamba\npipeline on an AMD ZCU102 FPGA and ASIC using GlobalFoundries (GF) 22 nm\ntechnology. Experimental results show 4.95-5.62$\\times$ lower latency and\n2.22-9.95$\\times$ higher throughput, with 4.77$\\times$ smaller area,\n9.84$\\times$ lower power, and 48.6$\\times$ lower energy consumption than\nbaseline solutions while maintaining competitive accuracy."}

Unlike\nprevious approaches that rely on fixed slope anchors, SC-Lane adaptively\ndetermines the fusion of slope-specific height features, improving robustness\nto diverse road geometries. To achieve this, we propose a Slope-Aware Adaptive\nFeature module that dynamically predicts the appropriate weights from image\ncues for integrating multi-slope representations into a unified heightmap.\nAdditionally, a Height Consistency Module enforces temporal coherence, ensuring\nstable and accurate height estimation across consecutive frames, which is\ncrucial for real-world driving scenarios. To evaluate the effectiveness of\nSC-Lane, we employ three standardized metrics-Mean Absolute Error(MAE), Root\nMean Squared Error (RMSE), and threshold-based accuracy-which, although common\nin surface and depth estimation, have been underutilized for road height\nassessment. Using the LiDAR-derived heightmap dataset introduced in prior work\n[20], we benchmark our method under these metrics, thereby establishing a\nrigorous standard for future comparisons. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane\nbenchmark demonstrate that SC-Lane significantly improves both height\nestimation and 3D lane detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance with\nan F-score of 64.3%, outperforming existing methods by a notable margin.

To overcome this limitation, we propose HM-Talker, a novel\nframework for generating high-fidelity, temporally coherent talking heads.\nHM-Talker leverages a hybrid motion representation combining both implicit and\nexplicit motion cues.

To\novercome the limitations above, we propose TriFlowSR, a novel framework that\nexplicitly achieves pattern matching between the LR image and the reference HR\nimage. Meanwhile, we introduce Landmark-4K, the first RefSR dataset for\nUltra-High-Definition (UHD) landmark scenarios. Considering the UHD scenarios\nwith real-world degradation, in TriFlowSR, we design a Reference Matching\nStrategy to effectively match the LR image with the reference HR image.\nExperimental results show that our approach can better utilize the semantic and\ntexture information of the reference HR image compared to previous methods. To\nthe best of our knowledge, we propose the first diffusion-based RefSR pipeline\nfor ultra-high definition landmark scenarios under real-world degradation. Our\ncode and model will be available at https://github.com/nkicsl/TriFlowSR."}

We term this principle 'Dynamical Alignment'.\n  Applying this principle offers a novel resolution to the long-standing\nparadox of why brain-inspired spiking neural networks (SNNs) underperform. By\nencoding static input into controllable dynamical trajectories, we uncover a\nbimodal optimization landscape with a critical phase transition governed by\nphase space volume dynamics. A 'dissipative' mode, driven by contracting\ndynamics, achieves superior energy efficiency through sparse temporal codes. In\ncontrast, an 'expansive' mode, driven by expanding dynamics, unlocks the\nrepresentational power required for SNNs to match or even exceed their\nartificial neural network counterparts on diverse tasks, including\nclassification, reinforcement learning, and cognitive integration.\n  We find this computational advantage emerges from a timescale alignment\nbetween input dynamics and neuronal integration.

To address this, we introduce ToonComposer, a generative model that\nunifies inbetweening and colorization into a single post-keyframing stage.\nToonComposer employs a sparse sketch injection mechanism to provide precise\ncontrol using keyframe sketches.

A key challenge is that the street-view visual\nquestion-and-answer (VQA) data provides only microscopic visual cues, leading\nto subpar performance in fine-tuned models. To tackle this issue, we\nincorporate perspective-invariant satellite images as macro cues and propose\ncross-view alignment tuning including a satellite-view and street-view image\ngrafting mechanism, along with an automatic label generation mechanism. Then\nLVLM's global understanding of street distribution is enhanced through\ncross-view matching. Our proposed model, named AddressVLM, consists of\ntwo-stage training protocols: cross-view alignment tuning and address\nlocalization tuning. Furthermore, we have constructed two street-view VQA\ndatasets based on image address localization datasets from Pittsburgh and San\nFrancisco.

In ANNs, knowledge is thought to reside in connection weights or in\nattractor basins, but these two paradigms are not linked explicitly. Here we\ncomprehensively analyse mechanisms of memory formation in an 81-neuron Hopfield\nnetwork undergoing Hebbian learning by revealing bifurcations leading to\nformation and destruction of attractors and their basin boundaries. We show\nthat, by affecting evolution of connection weights, the applied stimuli induce\na pitchfork and then a cascade of saddle-node bifurcations creating new\nattractors with their basins that can code true or spurious memories, and an\nabrupt disappearance of old memories (catastrophic forgetting). With successful\nlearning, new categories are represented by the basins of newly born point\nattractors, and their boundaries by the stable manifolds of new saddles. With\nthis, memorisation and forgetting represent two manifestations of the same\nmechanism. Our strategy to analyse high-dimensional learning ANNs is universal\nand applicable to recurrent ANNs of any form.

For credit assignment, MS-GRPO attributes the entire cumulative\nepisode reward to each individual episode step. We supplement this algorithm\nwith a novel absolute-advantage-weighted episode sampling strategy that we show\nimproves training performance. We evaluate our approach by post-training a\n3-billion parameter model on Snake and Frozen Lake. Our experiments demonstrate\nthat the method is effective in improving decision-making performance: our\npost-trained 3B parameter model outperforms a 72B parameter baseline by 50% on\nthe Frozen Lake task. This work demonstrates that targeted post-training is a\npractical and efficient alternative to relying on model scale for creating\nsequential decision-making agents using LLMs."}

Nevertheless, existing research\nsuffers from insufficient examination of language use quality, unsatisfactory\nmodeling effectiveness due to data scarcity and imbalance, and a lack of\nefforts to explain model predictions. To address these gaps, we propose a\nmulti-dimensional modeling framework that integrates feature engineering, data\naugmentation, and explainable machine learning. This approach prioritizes\nexplainability over ``black box'' predictions by utilizing only\nconstruct-relevant, transparent features and conducting Shapley Value (SHAP)\nanalysis. Our results demonstrate strong predictive performance on a novel\nEnglish-Chinese consecutive interpreting dataset, identifying BLEURT and\nCometKiwi scores to be the strongest predictive features for fidelity,\npause-related features for fluency, and Chinese-specific phraseological\ndiversity metrics for language use. Overall, by placing particular emphasis on\nexplainability, we present a scalable, reliable, and transparent alternative to\ntraditional human evaluation, facilitating the provision of detailed diagnostic\nfeedback for learners and supporting self-regulated learning advantages not\nafforded by automated scores in isolation."}

By\nformulating the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) within a custom\nOpenAI Gymnasium environment, our method simulates orbital dynamics using\nclassical Keplerian elements. The agent progressively learns to adjust five of\nthe orbital parameters - semi-major axis, eccentricity, inclination, right\nascension of ascending node, and the argument of perigee-to achieve targeted\nterrestrial coverage. Comparative evaluation against Proximal Policy\nOptimization (PPO) demonstrates A2C's superior performance, achieving 5.8x\nhigher cumulative rewards (10.0 vs 9.263025) while converging in 31.5x fewer\ntimesteps (2,000 vs 63,000). The A2C agent consistently meets mission\nobjectives across diverse target coordinates while maintaining computational\nefficiency suitable for real-time mission planning applications.

These dynamic\ndialogues enable adaptive attack strategies that can cause severe privacy\nviolations, yet their evolving nature makes it difficult to anticipate and\ndiscover sophisticated vulnerabilities manually. To tackle this problem, we\npresent a search-based framework that alternates between improving attacker and\ndefender instructions by simulating privacy-critical agent interactions. Each\nsimulation involves three roles: data subject, data sender, and data recipient.\nWhile the data subject's behavior is fixed, the attacker (data recipient)\nattempts to extract sensitive information from the defender (data sender)\nthrough persistent and interactive exchanges. To explore this interaction space\nefficiently, our search algorithm employs LLMs as optimizers, using parallel\nsearch with multiple threads and cross-thread propagation to analyze simulation\ntrajectories and iteratively propose new instructions. Through this process, we\nfind that attack strategies escalate from simple direct requests to\nsophisticated multi-turn tactics such as impersonation and consent forgery,\nwhile defenses advance from rule-based constraints to identity-verification\nstate machines. The discovered attacks and defenses transfer across diverse\nscenarios and backbone models, demonstrating strong practical utility for\nbuilding privacy-aware agents."}

Despite recent\nadvances in AI, existing methods often handle these stages separately, leading\nto error accumulation and artifacts. For instance, inbetweening approaches\nstruggle with large motions, while colorization methods require dense per-frame\nsketches. To address this, we introduce ToonComposer, a generative model that\nunifies inbetweening and colorization into a single post-keyframing stage.\nToonComposer employs a sparse sketch injection mechanism to provide precise\ncontrol using keyframe sketches. Additionally, it uses a cartoon adaptation\nmethod with the spatial low-rank adapter to tailor a modern video foundation\nmodel to the cartoon domain while keeping its temporal prior intact. Requiring\nas few as a single sketch and a colored reference frame, ToonComposer excels\nwith sparse inputs, while also supporting multiple sketches at any temporal\nlocation for more precise motion control. This dual capability reduces manual\nworkload and improves flexibility, empowering artists in real-world scenarios.\nTo evaluate our model, we further created PKBench, a benchmark featuring\nhuman-drawn sketches that simulate real-world use cases. Our evaluation\ndemonstrates that ToonComposer outperforms existing methods in visual quality,\nmotion consistency, and production efficiency, offering a superior and more\nflexible solution for AI-assisted cartoon production."}

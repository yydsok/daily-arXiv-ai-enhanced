Developers must navigate documentation,\nunderstand APIs, and write integration code, creating significant barriers to\nefficient software reuse. To address this, we present EnvX, a framework that\nleverages Agentic AI to agentize GitHub repositories, transforming them into\nintelligent, autonomous agents capable of natural language interaction and\ninter-agent collaboration. Unlike existing approaches that treat repositories\nas static code resources, EnvX reimagines them as active agents through a\nthree-phase process: (1) TODO-guided environment initialization, which sets up\nthe necessary dependencies, data, and validation datasets; (2) human-aligned\nagentic automation, allowing repository-specific agents to autonomously perform\nreal-world tasks; and (3) Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol, enabling multiple\nagents to collaborate. By combining large language model capabilities with\nstructured tool integration, EnvX automates not just code generation, but the\nentire process of understanding, initializing, and operationalizing repository\nfunctionality. We evaluate EnvX on the GitTaskBench benchmark, using 18\nrepositories across domains such as image processing, speech recognition,\ndocument analysis, and video manipulation. Our results show that EnvX achieves\na 74.07% execution completion rate and 51.85% task pass rate, outperforming\nexisting frameworks. Case studies further demonstrate EnvX's ability to enable\nmulti-repository collaboration via the A2A protocol. This work marks a shift\nfrom treating repositories as passive code resources to intelligent,\ninteractive agents, fostering greater accessibility and collaboration within\nthe open-source ecosystem."}

To\naddress this limitation, we propose RB-CBS, a novel extension to CBS that\ndynamically allocates and adjusts user-specified risk bound ($\\Delta$) across\nagents to flexibly trade off safety and speed. Our improved planner ensures\nthat each agent receives a local risk budget ($\\delta$) enabling more efficient\nnavigation while still respecting overall safety constraints. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that this iterative risk-allocation framework yields\nsuperior performance in complex environments, allowing multiple agents to find\ncollision-free paths within the user-specified $\\Delta$."}

We build upon this research and develop a multi-dimensional\nexamination framework to systematically determine which characteristics of the\ninput data, including both the image and the accompanying prompt, lead to such\ndifferences in performance. Using open-source VLMs, we further examine how\nattention values fluctuate with varying input parameters (e.g., image size,\nnumber of objects in the image, background color, prompt specificity). This\nresearch aims to learn how the behavior of vision language models changes and\nto explore methods for characterizing such changes. Our results suggest, among\nother things, that even minor modifications in image characteristics and prompt\nspecificity can lead to large changes in how a VLM formulates its answer and,\nsubsequently, its overall performance."}

The method employs an ensemble of feedforward\nNNs to predict contact forces, then exploits the prediction to solve an\noptimization problem and generate an optimal residual action, which is added to\nthe DFC output and applied to an impedance controller. The proposed\nVelocity-augmented Artificial intelligence Interaction Controller for Ambiguous\nModels (VAICAM) is validated in the Gazebo simulator on a Franka Emika Panda\nrobot. Against a vast set of trajectories, VAICAM achieves superior performance\ncompared to two baseline controllers."}

However, massive parameters impose heavy GPU\nmemory (i.e., VRAM) demands, hindering the widespread adoption of MoE LLMs.\nOffloading the expert parameters to CPU RAM offers an effective way to\nalleviate the VRAM requirements for MoE inference. Existing approaches\ntypically cache a small subset of experts in VRAM and dynamically prefetch\nexperts from RAM during inference, leading to significant degradation in\ninference speed due to the poor cache hit rate and substantial expert loading\nlatency. In this work, we propose MoEpic, an efficient MoE inference system\nwith a novel expert split mechanism. Specifically, each expert is vertically\ndivided into two segments: top and bottom. MoEpic caches the top segment of hot\nexperts, so that more experts will be stored under the limited VRAM budget,\nthereby improving the cache hit rate. During each layer's inference, MoEpic\npredicts and prefetches the activated experts for the next layer. Since the top\nsegments of cached experts are exempt from fetching, the loading time is\nreduced, which allows efficient transfer-computation overlap. Nevertheless, the\nperformance of MoEpic critically depends on the cache configuration (i.e., each\nlayer's VRAM budget and expert split ratio). To this end, we propose a\ndivide-and-conquer algorithm based on fixed-point iteration for adaptive cache\nconfiguration. Extensive experiments on popular MoE LLMs demonstrate that\nMoEpic can save about half of the GPU cost, while lowering the inference\nlatency by about 37.51%-65.73% compared to the baselines."}

We find\nthat these methods, designed for contexts in which variation from a single\nground-truth label is considered noise, often remove annotators who disagree\ninstead of spam annotators, introducing suboptimal tradeoffs between accuracy\nand label diversity. We find that conservative settings for annotator removal\n(<5%) are best, after which all tested methods increase the mean absolute error\nfrom the true average label.

To\naddress these challenges, we aim to improve the accuracy of AIGM detection by\nanalyzing the structural patterns of music segments. Specifically, to extract\nmusical features from short audio clips, we integrated various pre-trained\nmodels, including self-supervised learning (SSL) models or an audio effect\nencoder, each within our suggested transformer-based framework. Furthermore,\nfor long audio, we developed a segment transformer that divides music into\nsegments and learns inter-segment relationships. We used the FakeMusicCaps and\nSONICS datasets, achieving high accuracy in both the short-audio and full-audio\ndetection experiments. These findings suggest that integrating segment-level\nmusical features into long-range temporal analysis can effectively enhance both\nthe performance and robustness of AIGM detection systems."}

Its early cutaneous manifestations are clinically\nsignificant but often underdiagnosed, particularly in rural areas with limited\naccess to dermatologists. Automated, image-based diagnostic solutions can\nsupport early detection and timely interventions.\n  Methods: In this study, we propose an end-to-end framework for arsenicosis\ndiagnosis using mobile phone-captured skin images. A dataset comprising 20\nclasses and over 11000 images of arsenic-induced and other dermatological\nconditions was curated. Multiple deep learning architectures, including\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based models, were\nbenchmarked for arsenicosis detection. Model interpretability was integrated\nvia LIME and Grad-CAM, while deployment feasibility was demonstrated through a\nweb-based diagnostic tool.\n  Results: Transformer-based models significantly outperformed CNNs, with the\nSwin Transformer achieving the best results (86\\\\% accuracy). LIME and Grad-CAM\nvisualizations confirmed that the models attended to lesion-relevant regions,\nincreasing clinical transparency and aiding in error analysis. The framework\nalso demonstrated strong performance on external validation samples, confirming\nits ability to generalize beyond the curated dataset.\n  Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates the potential of deep\nlearning for non-invasive, accessible, and explainable diagnosis of arsenicosis\nfrom mobile-acquired images.

To bridge this gap, we introduce AgentGym-RL, a new framework to\ntrain LLM agents for multi-turn interactive decision-making through RL. The\nframework features a modular and decoupled architecture, ensuring high\nflexibility and extensibility. It encompasses a wide variety of real-world\nscenarios, and supports mainstream RL algorithms.

In early stages, it emphasizes exploitation\nby restricting the number of interactions, and gradually shifts towards\nexploration with larger horizons to encourage diverse problem-solving\nstrategies. In this way, the agent develops more diverse behaviors and is less\nprone to collapse under long horizons. We perform extensive experiments to\nvalidate the stability and effectiveness of both the AgentGym-RL framework and\nthe ScalingInter-RL approach.

As a result, such methods struggle to accurately\nreproduce real sensor noise. To address these limitations, this paper derives a\nnoise model from the physical noise generation mechanisms that occur under low\nillumination and proposes a novel composite model that integrates both additive\nand multiplicative noise. To solve the model, we introduce a physics based per\npixel noise simulation and calibration scheme that estimates and synthesizes\nnoise for each individual pixel, thereby overcoming the restrictions of\ntraditional global calibration and capturing spatial noise variations induced\nby microscopic CMOS manufacturing differences. Motivated by the strong\nperformance of rectified flow methods in image generation and processing, we\nfurther combine the physics-based noise synthesis with a rectified flow\ngenerative framework and present PGRF a physics-guided rectified flow framework\nfor low light image enhancement.

RoentMod combines an\nopen-source medical image generator (RoentGen) with an image-to-image\nmodification model without requiring retraining. In reader studies with\nboard-certified radiologists and radiology residents, RoentMod-produced images\nappeared realistic in 93\\% of cases, correctly incorporated the specified\nfinding in 89-99\\% of cases, and preserved native anatomy comparable to real\nfollow-up CXRs. Using RoentMod, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art multi-task\nand foundation models frequently exploit off-target pathology as shortcuts,\nlimiting their specificity. Incorporating RoentMod-generated counterfactual\nimages during training mitigated this vulnerability, improving model\ndiscrimination across multiple pathologies by 3-19\\% AUC in internal validation\nand by 1-11\\% for 5 out of 6 tested pathologies in external testing. These\nfindings establish RoentMod as a broadly applicable tool for probing and\ncorrecting shortcut learning in medical AI. By enabling controlled\ncounterfactual interventions, RoentMod enhances the robustness and\ninterpretability of CXR interpretation models and provides a generalizable\nstrategy for improving foundation models in medical imaging."}

This paper introduces FMT$^{x}$, an extension of the Fast Marching\nTree algorithm that enables efficient and consistent replanning in dynamic\nenvironments. We revisit the neighbor selection rule of FMT$^{*}$ and\ndemonstrate that a minimal change overcomes its single-pass limitation,\nenabling the algorithm to update cost-to-come values upon discovering better\nconnections without sacrificing asymptotic optimality or computational\nefficiency. By maintaining a cost-ordered priority queue and applying a\nselective update condition that uses an expanding neighbor to identify and\ntrigger the re-evaluation of any node with a potentially suboptimal path,\nFMT$^{x}$ ensures that suboptimal routes are efficiently repaired as the\nenvironment evolves. This targeted strategy preserves the inherent efficiency\nof FMT$^{*}$ while enabling robust adaptation to changes in obstacle\nconfiguration. FMT$^{x}$ is proven to recover an asymptotically optimal\nsolution after environmental changes. Experimental results demonstrate that\nFMT$^{x}$ outperforms the influential replanner RRT$^{x}$, reacting more\nswiftly to dynamic events with lower computational overhead and thus offering a\nmore effective solution for real-time robotic navigation in unpredictable\nworlds."}

However, directly\napplying LLMs to channel prediction faces a domain mismatch issue stemming from\ntheir text-based pre-training. To mitigate this, the ``adapter + LLM\" paradigm\nhas emerged, where an adapter is designed to bridge the domain gap between the\nchannel state information (CSI) data and LLMs. While showing initial success,\nexisting adapters may not fully exploit the potential of this paradigm. To\naddress this limitation, this work provides a key insight that learning\nrepresentations from the spectral components of CSI features can more\neffectively help bridge the domain gap. Accordingly, we propose a\nspectral-attentive framework, named SCA-LLM, for channel prediction in\nmultiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing\n(MIMO-OFDM) systems. Specifically, its novel adapter can capture finer spectral\ndetails and better adapt the LLM for channel prediction than previous methods.\nExtensive simulations show that SCA-LLM achieves state-of-the-art prediction\nperformance and strong generalization, yielding up to $-2.4~\\text{dB}$\nnormalized mean squared error (NMSE) advantage over the previous LLM based\nmethod.

Deep learning multi-task and foundation models\nhave shown strong performance for CXR interpretation but are vulnerable to\nshortcut learning, where models rely on spurious and off-target correlations\nrather than clinically relevant features to make decisions. We introduce\nRoentMod, a counterfactual image editing framework that generates anatomically\nrealistic CXRs with user-specified, synthetic pathology while preserving\nunrelated anatomical features of the original scan. RoentMod combines an\nopen-source medical image generator (RoentGen) with an image-to-image\nmodification model without requiring retraining. In reader studies with\nboard-certified radiologists and radiology residents, RoentMod-produced images\nappeared realistic in 93\\% of cases, correctly incorporated the specified\nfinding in 89-99\\% of cases, and preserved native anatomy comparable to real\nfollow-up CXRs. Using RoentMod, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art multi-task\nand foundation models frequently exploit off-target pathology as shortcuts,\nlimiting their specificity. Incorporating RoentMod-generated counterfactual\nimages during training mitigated this vulnerability, improving model\ndiscrimination across multiple pathologies by 3-19\\% AUC in internal validation\nand by 1-11\\% for 5 out of 6 tested pathologies in external testing.

In this way, the agent develops more diverse behaviors and is less\nprone to collapse under long horizons.

We demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our method in both simulated environments and real-world\ntests, highlighting its robustness and deployability. Our approach outperforms\nexisting state-of-the-art methods, offering a more adaptable and effective\nsolution for visual navigation in open-set environments.

Since the 1980s, categorizing the diversity of CDR\nstructures into canonical clusters has enabled the identification of key\nstructural motifs of antibodies. However, existing approaches have limited\ncoverage and cannot be readily incorporated into protein foundation models.\nHere we introduce ImmunoGlobulin LOOp Tokenizer, Igloo, a multimodal antibody\nloop tokenizer that encodes backbone dihedral angles and sequence. Igloo is\ntrained using a contrastive learning objective to map loops with similar\nbackbone dihedral angles closer together in latent space. Igloo can efficiently\nretrieve the closest matching loop structures from a structural antibody\ndatabase, outperforming existing methods on identifying similar H3 loops by\n5.9\\%. Igloo assigns tokens to all loops, addressing the limited coverage issue\nof canonical clusters, while retaining the ability to recover canonical loop\nconformations. To demonstrate the versatility of Igloo tokens, we show that\nthey can be incorporated into protein language models with IglooLM and\nIglooALM. On predicting binding affinity of heavy chain variants, IglooLM\noutperforms the base protein language model on 8 out of 10 antibody-antigen\ntargets. Additionally, it is on par with existing state-of-the-art\nsequence-based and multimodal protein language models, performing comparably to\nmodels with $7\\times$ more parameters. IglooALM samples antibody loops which\nare diverse in sequence and more consistent in structure than state-of-the-art\nantibody inverse folding models.

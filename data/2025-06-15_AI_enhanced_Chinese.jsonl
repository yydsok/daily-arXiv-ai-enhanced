Current methods often rigidly convert pre-generated keyframes into\nfixed-length clips, resulting in disjointed narratives and pacing issues.\nFurthermore, the inherent instability of video generation models means that\neven a single low-quality clip can significantly degrade the entire output\nanimation's logical coherence and visual continuity. To overcome these\nobstacles, we introduce AniMaker, a multi-agent framework enabling efficient\nmulti-candidate clip generation and storytelling-aware clip selection, thus\ncreating globally consistent and story-coherent animation solely from text\ninput. The framework is structured around specialized agents, including the\nDirector Agent for storyboard generation, the Photography Agent for video clip\ngeneration, the Reviewer Agent for evaluation, and the Post-Production Agent\nfor editing and voiceover. Central to AniMaker's approach are two key technical\ncomponents: MCTS-Gen in Photography Agent, an efficient Monte Carlo Tree Search\n(MCTS)-inspired strategy that intelligently navigates the candidate space to\ngenerate high-potential clips while optimizing resource usage; and AniEval in\nReviewer Agent, the first framework specifically designed for multi-shot\nanimation evaluation, which assesses critical aspects such as story-level\nconsistency, action completion, and animation-specific features by considering\neach clip in the context of its preceding and succeeding clips.

Meanwhile, poor channel quality leads to data errors and\nworsens user experience. To solve this, we've proposed the Semantic\nCommunication-Enabled Cloud-Edge-End Collaborative Immersive Metaverse Service\n(SC-CEE-Meta) Architecture, which includes three modules: VR video semantic\ntransmission, video synthesis, and 3D virtual scene reconstruction. By\ndeploying semantic modules on VR devices and edge servers and sending key\nsemantic info instead of focusing on bit-level reconstruction, it can cut\nlatency, resolve the resource-bandwidth conflict, and better withstand channel\ninterference. Also, the cloud deploys video synthesis and 3D scene\nreconstruction preprocessing, while edge devices host 3D reconstruction\nrendering modules, all for immersive services. Verified on Meta Quest Pro, the\nSC-CEE-Meta can reduce wireless transmission delay by 96.05\\% and boost image\nquality by 43.99\\% under poor channel condition.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u4e91-\u8fb9-\u7aef\u534f\u4f5c\u67b6\u6784\uff08SC-CEE-Meta\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u5143\u5b87\u5b99\u4e2d\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u865a\u62df\u573a\u666f\u4f20\u8f93\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u5e26\u5bbd\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u4f20\u8f93\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u6b65\u548c\u5bf9\u65b0\u89c6\u542c\u4f53\u9a8c\u7684\u8ffd\u6c42\uff0c\u5143\u5b87\u5b99\u53d7\u5230\u70ed\u6367\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u9762\u4e34\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u865a\u62df\u573a\u666f\u4f20\u8f93\u7684\u5e26\u5bbd\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSC-CEE-Meta\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5305\u542bVR\u89c6\u9891\u8bed\u4e49\u4f20\u8f93\u3001\u89c6\u9891\u5408\u6210\u548c3D\u865a\u62df\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u4e09\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u51cf\u5c11\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e91\u7aef\u548c\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u90e8\u7f72\u9884\u5904\u7406\u548c\u6e32\u67d3\u6a21\u5757\u3002", "result": "\u5728Meta Quest Pro\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cSC-CEE-Meta\u5728\u6076\u52a3\u4fe1\u9053\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u53ef\u51cf\u5c1196.05%\u7684\u65e0\u7ebf\u4f20\u8f93\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u534743.99%\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "SC-CEE-Meta\u67b6\u6784\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u534f\u4f5c\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5143\u5b87\u5b99\u4e2d\u7684\u4f20\u8f93\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002"}}

When an AI system is engineered for deductively\nwatertight guarantees (demonstrable certainty about the error-free nature of\nits outputs) -- as in classical symbolic AI -- its operational domain must be\nnarrowly circumscribed and pre-structured. Conversely, a system that can input\nhigh-dimensional data to produce rich information outputs -- as in contemporary\ngenerative models -- necessarily relinquishes the possibility of zero-error\nperformance, incurring an irreducible risk of errors or misclassification. By\nmaking this previously implicit trade-off explicit and open to rigorous\nverification, the conjecture significantly reframes both engineering ambitions\nand philosophical expectations for AI. After reviewing the historical\nmotivations for this tension, the article states the conjecture in\ninformation-theoretic form and contextualises it within broader debates in\nepistemology, formal verification, and the philosophy of technology. It then\noffers an analysis of its implications and consequences, drawing on notions of\nunderdetermination, prudent epistemic risk, and moral responsibility. The\ndiscussion clarifies how, if correct, the conjecture would help reshape\nevaluation standards, governance frameworks, and hybrid system design.

AVD aims to generate causal video frames based on\naccident or accident-free text prompts while preserving the style and content\nof frames for TAA after video generation. This approach can be trained using\ndatasets collected from various driving scenes without any extra annotations.\nAdditionally, AVD facilitates an Equivariant TAA (EQ-TAA) with an equivariant\ntriple loss for an anchor accident-free video clip, along with the generated\npair of contrastive pseudo-normal and pseudo-accident clips.

We address the control challenge using a\nmask-driven LoRA tuning strategy that adapts a pre-trained image-to-video model\nto the editing context.

While prior works have attempted to address\nthese issues, they are typically treated independently, lacking a unified and\nrobust solution suited to real-world federated audio scenarios. To bridge this\ngap, we propose FedMLAC, a unified mutual learning framework designed to\nsimultaneously tackle these challenges in FedAC.

Through\nbidirectional knowledge distillation, the Plug-in model enables global\nknowledge transfer while adapting to client-specific data distributions, thus\nsupporting both generalization and personalization. To further enhance\nrobustness against corrupted audio data, we develop a Layer-wise Pruning\nAggregation (LPA) strategy that filters unreliable Plug-in model updates based\non parameter deviations during server-side aggregation.

Large Language Models (LLMs) and other modern NLP systems face\ninherent limitations precisely because they operate within natural language\nitself, making them subject to the same interpretive constraints imposed by\nsemantic degeneracy. In this work, we argue using Kolmogorov complexity that as\nan expression's complexity grows, the likelihood of any interpreting agent\n(human or LLM-powered AI) recovering the single intended meaning vanishes. This\ncomputational intractability suggests the classical view that linguistic forms\npossess meaning in and of themselves is flawed. We alternatively posit that\nmeaning is instead actualized through an observer-dependent interpretive act.\nTo test this, we conducted a semantic Bell inequality test using diverse LLM\nagents as ``computational cognitive systems'' to interpret ambiguous word pairs\nunder varied contextual settings. Across several independent experiments, we\nfound average CHSH expectation values ranging from 1.2 to 2.8, with several\nruns yielding values (e.g., 2.3-2.4) that significantly violate the classical\nboundary ($|S|\\leq2$). This demonstrates that linguistic interpretation under\nambiguity can exhibit non-classical contextuality, consistent with results from\nhuman cognition experiments.

For\ntransparency and accountability, we propose a formal framework for assessing\nintentional behaviour in probabilistic decision-making agents, introducing\nquantitative metrics of agency and intention quotient.

We propose an adaptive\nbimodal framework enabling flexible single-/dual-modality HER2 prediction\nthrough three innovations: 1) A dynamic branch selector that activates either\nsingle-modality reconstruction or dual-modality joint inference based on input\ncompleteness; 2) A bidirectional cross-modal GAN performing context-aware\nfeature-space reconstruction of missing modalities; 3) A hybrid training\nprotocol integrating adversarial learning and multi-task optimization. This\narchitecture elevates single-modality H&E prediction accuracy from 71.44% to\n94.25% while achieving 95.09% dual-modality accuracy, maintaining 90.28%\nreliability with sole IHC inputs. The framework's \"dual-preferred,\nsingle-compatible\" design delivers near-bimodal performance without requiring\nsynchronized acquisition, particularly benefiting resource-limited settings\nthrough IHC infrastructure cost reduction.

To address this\ngap, this paper introduces WGSR-Bench, the first strategy reasoning benchmark\nfor LLMs using wargame as its evaluation environment. Wargame, a quintessential\nhigh-complexity strategic scenario, integrates environmental uncertainty,\nadversarial dynamics, and non-unique strategic choices, making it an effective\ntestbed for assessing LLMs' capabilities in multi-agent decision-making, intent\ninference, and counterfactual reasoning. WGSR-Bench designs test samples around\nthree core tasks, i.e., Environmental situation awareness, Opponent risk\nmodeling and Policy generation, which serve as the core S-POE architecture, to\nsystematically assess main abilities of strategic reasoning.

We\nconceptualize effective audio-LLM interaction as the LLM's ability to\nproficiently probe the audio encoder representations to satisfy textual\nqueries. This paper presents a systematic investigation on how architectural\ndesign choices can affect that. Beginning with a standard Pengi/LLaVA-style\naudio-LLM architecture, we propose and evaluate several modifications guided by\nhypotheses derived from mechanistic interpretability studies and LLM\noperational principles. Our experiments demonstrate that: (1) delaying audio\nintegration until the LLM's initial layers establish textual context that\nenhances its ability to probe the audio representations for relevant\ninformation; (2) the LLM can proficiently probe audio representations\nexclusively through LLM layer's attention submodule, without requiring\npropagation to its Feed-Forward Network (FFN) submodule; (3) an efficiently\nintegrated ensemble of diverse audio encoders provides richer, complementary\nrepresentations, thereby broadening the LLM's capacity to probe a wider\nspectrum of audio information. All hypotheses are evaluated using an identical\nthree-stage training curriculum on a dataset of 5.6 million audio-text pairs,\nensuring controlled comparisons. Our final architecture, which incorporates all\nproposed modifications, achieves relative improvements from 10\\% to 60\\% over\nthe baseline, validating our approach to optimizing cross-modal information\ntransfer in audio-LLMs. Project page: https://ta012.github.io/PAL/", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u97f3\u9891-LLM\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u5347\u97f3\u9891\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u534710%-60%\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u97f3\u9891\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e0eLLM\u4e4b\u95f4\u9ad8\u6548\u8bed\u4e49\u4f20\u9012\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u97f3\u9891-LLM\u4ea4\u4e92\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u79cd\u67b6\u6784\u4fee\u6539\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5ef6\u8fdf\u97f3\u9891\u96c6\u6210\u3001\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5b50\u6a21\u5757\u63a2\u6d4b\u97f3\u9891\u8868\u5f81\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u96c6\u6210\u591a\u6837\u5316\u97f3\u9891\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u540e\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u57285.6\u767e\u4e07\u97f3\u9891-\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u663e\u8457\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f18\u5316\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u97f3\u9891-LLM\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

A designed feature estimation loop ensures\nstable and fast motion control when point features are outside the field of\nview. As 3D point features move inside the field of view, the IBVS feedback\nloop preserves the precision of the pose at the end of the control period.\nAlso, an adaptive controller is developed in the feedback loop to stabilize the\nsystem in the entire range of operations.

Machine learning techniques are frequently used to\naddress such tasks, typically by leveraging model error bounds to specify\nrobust constraint-based safety filters. However, if the learned model\nuncertainty is very high, the corresponding filters are potentially invalid,\nmeaning no control input satisfies the constraints imposed by the safety\nfilter. While most works address this issue by assuming some form of safe\nbackup controller, ours tackles it by collecting additional data on the fly\nusing a Gaussian process bandit-type algorithm.

However, few studies have looked into the\npractical challenge of deployment across domains (e.g., cities). Although\nseveral works have incorporated Large Language Models (LLMs) to leverage their\nopen-world knowledge, LLMs do not guarantee cross-domain driving performance\nand may incur prohibitive retraining costs during domain adaptation. In this\npaper, we propose RoCA, a novel framework for robust cross-domain E2E\nautonomous driving. RoCA formulates the joint probabilistic distribution over\nthe tokens that encode ego and surrounding vehicle information in the E2E\npipeline. Instantiating with a Gaussian process (GP), RoCA learns a set of\nbasis tokens with corresponding trajectories, which span diverse driving\nscenarios. Then, given any driving scene, it is able to probabilistically infer\nthe future trajectory.

By alternating\nbetween frequent, low-fidelity training and periodic, high-fidelity\nevaluations, PAL enhances the sample efficiency of NEAT, enabling agents to\ndiscover effective strategies in fewer training iterations. We evaluate\nNeuroPAL in a fixed-map, single-race scenario in StarCraft: Brood War and\ncompare its performance to standard NEAT-based training. Our results show that\nPAL significantly accelerates the learning process, allowing the agent to reach\ncompetitive levels of play in approximately half the training time required by\nNEAT alone.

However, ensuring adequate\ndiversity in generated samples of prompt-guided diffusion models remains a\nchallenge, particularly when the prompts span a broad semantic spectrum and the\ndiversity of generated data needs to be evaluated in a prompt-aware fashion\nacross semantically similar prompts. Recent methods have introduced guidance\nvia diversity measures to encourage more varied generations. In this work, we\nextend the diversity measure-based approaches by proposing the Scalable\nPrompt-Aware R\\'eny Kernel Entropy Diversity Guidance (SPARKE) method for\nprompt-aware diversity guidance. SPARKE utilizes conditional entropy for\ndiversity guidance, which dynamically conditions diversity measurement on\nsimilar prompts and enables prompt-aware diversity control. While the\nentropy-based guidance approach enhances prompt-aware diversity, its reliance\non the matrix-based entropy scores poses computational challenges in\nlarge-scale generation settings. To address this, we focus on the special case\nof Conditional latent RKE Score Guidance, reducing entropy computation and\ngradient-based optimization complexity from the $O(n^3)$ of general entropy\nmeasures to $O(n)$. The reduced computational complexity allows for\ndiversity-guided sampling over potentially thousands of generation rounds on\ndifferent prompts. We numerically test the SPARKE method on several\ntext-to-image diffusion models, demonstrating that the proposed method improves\nthe prompt-aware diversity of the generated data without incurring significant\ncomputational costs.

However, these agents still struggle\nwith long-horizon tasks in online environments, primarily due to insufficient\nknowledge and the inherent gap between offline and online domains. In this\npaper, inspired by how humans generalize knowledge in open-ended environments,\nwe propose a Hierarchical Multimodal Skills (HMS) module to tackle the issue of\ninsufficient knowledge. It progressively abstracts trajectories into execution\nskills, core skills, and ultimately meta-skills, providing a hierarchical\nknowledge structure for long-horizon task planning. To bridge the domain gap,\nwe propose the Skill-Augmented Monte Carlo Tree Search (SA-MCTS) algorithm,\nwhich efficiently leverages skills acquired in offline environments to reduce\nthe action search space during online tree exploration. Building on HMS, we\npropose Mirage-1, a multimodal, cross-platform, plug-and-play GUI agent. To\nvalidate the performance of Mirage-1 in real-world long-horizon scenarios, we\nconstructed a new benchmark, AndroidLH. Experimental results show that Mirage-1\noutperforms previous agents by 32\\%, 19\\%, 15\\%, and 79\\% on AndroidWorld,\nMobileMiniWob++, Mind2Web-Live, and AndroidLH, respectively.

Deviations from this baseline\ncan then be used to detect cloud presence and guide radiative transfer models\nin inferring atmospheric attenuation. Operational retrieval algorithms\ntypically approximate background reflectance using monthly statistics, assuming\nsurface properties vary slowly relative to atmospheric conditions. However,\nthis approach fails in mountainous regions where intermittent snow cover and\nchanging snow surfaces are frequent. We propose an attention-based emulator for\nSSR retrieval that implicitly learns to infer clear-sky surface reflectance\nfrom raw satellite image sequences. Built on the Temporo-Spatial Vision\nTransformer, our approach eliminates the need for hand-crafted features such as\nexplicit albedo maps or cloud masks. The emulator is trained on instantaneous\nSSR estimates from the HelioMont algorithm over Switzerland, a region\ncharacterized by complex terrain and dynamic snow cover. Inputs include\nmulti-spectral SEVIRI imagery from the Meteosat Second Generation platform,\naugmented with static topographic features and solar geometry. The target\nvariable is HelioMont's SSR, computed as the sum of its direct and diffuse\nhorizontal irradiance components, given at a spatial resolution of 1.7 km. We\nshow that, when provided a sufficiently long temporal context, the model\nmatches the performances of albedo-informed models, highlighting the model's\nability to internally learn and exploit latent surface reflectance dynamics.\nOur geospatial analysis shows this effect is most powerful in mountainous\nregions and improves generalization in both simple and complex topographic\nsettings.

Traditionally, Field Operational Testing (FOT) has been\npivotal for macroscopic safety validation of automotive driving functions up to\nSAE automation level 2. However, state-of-the-art derivations for empirical\nsafety demonstrations using FOT often result in impractical testing efforts,\nparticularly at higher automation levels.

Therefore, this publication systematically\nidentifies and evaluates state-of-the-art Reduction Approaches (RAs) for FOT,\nincluding novel methods reported in the literature. Based on an analysis of ISO\n21448, two models are derived: a generic model capturing the argumentation\ncomponents of the standard, and a base model, exemplarily applied to Automatic\nEmergency Braking (AEB) systems, establishing a baseline for the real-world\ndriving requirement for a Quantitative Safety Validation of Residual Risk\n(QSVRR). Subsequently, the RAs are assessed using four criteria:\nquantifiability, threats to validity, missing links, and black box\ncompatibility, highlighting potential benefits, inherent limitations, and\nidentifying key areas for further research. Our evaluation reveals that, while\nseveral approaches offer potential, none are free from missing links or other\nsubstantial shortcomings.

Yet, the standard linear probing (LP) fails to adequately reflect the\npotential of models trained with Masked Image Modeling (MIM), due to the\ndistributed nature of patch tokens. This motivates the need for attentive\nprobing, an alternative that uses attention to selectively aggregate\npatch-level features.

We\nintroduce efficient probing (EP), a multi-query cross-attention mechanism that\neliminates redundant projections, reduces the number of trainable parameters,\nand achieves up to a 10$\\times$ speed-up over conventional multi-head\nattention. Despite its simplicity, EP outperforms LP and prior attentive\nprobing approaches across seven benchmarks, generalizes well beyond MIM to\ndiverse pre-training paradigms, produces interpretable attention maps, and\nachieves strong gains in low-shot and layer-wise settings.

We systematically investigate class-selection strategies for mixing\nand discover that greater performance gains arise when combining classes\ndistant in the discriminator's embedding space, rather than close in the\ngenerator's condition space. Moreover, we empirically show that, under standard\nmetrics, the correlation between the generator's learned condition space and\nthe discriminator's embedding space is minimal.

Goal-conditioning these policies enables a single generalist policy\nto capture diverse behaviors contained within an offline dataset.

Hence,\nencouraging this temporal consistency in the representation space should\nfacilitate combinatorial generalization.

Despite recent progress, significant challenges remain due to\nthe semantic gap between music and dance motion, as music offers only abstract\ncues, such as melody, groove, and emotion, without explicitly specifying the\nphysical movements. Moreover, a single piece of music can produce multiple\nplausible dance interpretations. This one-to-many mapping demands additional\nguidance, as music alone provides limited information for generating diverse\ndance movements. The challenge is further amplified by the scarcity of paired\nmusic and dance data, which restricts the model\\^a\\u{A}\\'Zs ability to learn\ndiverse dance patterns. In this paper, we introduce DanceChat, a Large Language\nModel (LLM)-guided music-to-dance generation approach. We use an LLM as a\nchoreographer that provides textual motion instructions, offering explicit,\nhigh-level guidance for dance generation. This approach goes beyond implicit\nlearning from music alone, enabling the model to generate dance that is both\nmore diverse and better aligned with musical styles. Our approach consists of\nthree components: (1) an LLM-based pseudo instruction generation module that\nproduces textual dance guidance based on music style and structure, (2) a\nmulti-modal feature extraction and fusion module that integrates music, rhythm,\nand textual guidance into a shared representation, and (3) a diffusion-based\nmotion synthesis module together with a multi-modal alignment loss, which\nensures that the generated dance is aligned with both musical and textual cues.\nExtensive experiments on AIST++ and human evaluations show that DanceChat\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.", "AI": {"tldr": "DanceChat\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7f16\u821e\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u672c\u6307\u4ee4\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u4e14\u4e0e\u97f3\u4e50\u98ce\u683c\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u821e\u8e48\u52a8\u4f5c\u3002", "motivation": "\u97f3\u4e50\u4e0e\u821e\u8e48\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u9e3f\u6c9f\uff0c\u97f3\u4e50\u4ec5\u63d0\u4f9b\u62bd\u8c61\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u4e14\u4e00\u5bf9\u591a\u6620\u5c04\u95ee\u9898\u5bfc\u81f4\u821e\u8e48\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "1.

Auto-regressive models generate sentences by iteratively computing\nand sampling from the distribution of the next token. This iterative sampling\nintroduces stochasticity, leading to the assumption that language models make\nprobabilistic decisions, similar to sampling from unknown distributions.\nBuilding on this assumption, prior research has used simulated Gibbs sampling,\ninspired by experiments designed to elicit human priors, to infer the priors of\nlanguage models. In this paper, we revisit a critical question: Do language\nmodels possess Bayesian brains? Our findings show that under certain\nconditions, language models can exhibit near-deterministic decision-making,\nsuch as producing maximum likelihood estimations, even with a non-zero sampling\ntemperature. This challenges the sampling assumption and undermines previous\nmethods for eliciting human-like priors.

However, they still require a large number of queries\nand can become expensive to run when more video frames are used. In this paper,\nwe propose DySS, a novel method that employs state-space learning and dynamic\nqueries.

The state of the SSM then provides an\ninformative yet efficient summarization of the scene.

Our experiments\nwith fully controllable simulated datasets show that our method includes the\ntrue causal component in its diagnosis set for 82 p.c. of all cases while\neffectively reducing the search space in 73 p.c. of the scenarios. Additional\ntests on the real-world Secure Water Treatment dataset showcase the approach's\npotential for practical scenarios. Our results thus highlight our approach's\npotential for practical applications with large and complex cyber-physical\nsystems where limited prior knowledge is available.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u8bca\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u57fa\u672c\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u6b63\u5e38\u8fd0\u884c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u75c7\u72b6\u751f\u6210\u5668\u548c\u56fe\u8bca\u65ad\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bca\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u4fe1\u606f\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u75c7\u72b6\u751f\u6210\u5668\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u5c0f\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u56fe\u8bca\u65ad\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u4e2d82%\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u5305\u542b\u771f\u5b9e\u56e0\u679c\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c73%\u7684\u573a\u666f\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6709\u9650\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0b\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u4fe1\u606f\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

To address this problem, we introduce RAtional\nMAnipulation (RAMA), a new benchmark that challenges models with both unseen\nexecutable instructions and defective ones that should be rejected. In RAMA, we\nconstruct a dataset with over 14,000 samples, including diverse defective\ninstructions spanning six dimensions: visual, physical, semantic, motion,\nsafety, and out-of-context.

Specifically, producers\nof information goods (such as journalists, researchers, and creative\nprofessionals) need to be able to collectively bargain with AI product builders\nin order to receive reasonable terms and a sustainable return on the\ninformational value they contribute. We argue that without increased market\ncoordination or collective bargaining on the side of these primary information\nproducers, AI will exacerbate a large-scale \"information market failure\" that\nwill lead not only to undesirable concentration of capital, but also to a\npotential \"ecological collapse\" in the informational commons. On the other\nhand, collective bargaining in the information economy can create market\nfrictions and aligned incentives necessary for a pro-social, sustainable AI\nfuture.

Accurate state\nestimation, particularly of vehicle pose, is paramount for precise seafloor\nmapping, as even small surface deviations can have significant consequences\nwhen sensing the seafloor below. To address this challenge, we propose an\nInvariant Extended Kalman Filter (InEKF) framework designed to integrate\npartial orientation measurements. While conventional estimation often relies on\nrelative position measurements to fixed landmarks, open ocean ASVs primarily\nobserve a receding horizon. We leverage forward-facing monocular cameras to\nestimate roll and pitch with respect to this horizon, which provides\nyaw-ambiguous partial orientation information. To effectively utilize these\nmeasurements within the InEKF, we introduce a novel framework for incorporating\nsuch partial orientation data. This approach contrasts with traditional InEKF\nimplementations that assume full orientation measurements and is particularly\nrelevant for planar vehicle motion constrained to a \"seafaring plane.\" This\npaper details the developed InEKF framework; its integration with horizon-based\nroll/pitch observations and dual-antenna GPS heading measurements for ASV state\nestimation; and provides a comparative analysis against the InEKF using full\norientation and a Multiplicative EKF (MEKF).

Extensive\nexperiments across diverse reasoning benchmarks highlight PAG's dual\nadvancements: as a policy, it enhances direct generation and self-correction\naccuracy; as a verifier, its self-verification outperforms self-consistency.", "AI": {"tldr": "PAG\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u8f6e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8ba9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u6210\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u89d2\u8272\u95f4\u5207\u6362\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u4fee\u6b63\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u53ef\u9760\u9a8c\u8bc1\u81ea\u8eab\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u989d\u5916\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPAG\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u751f\u6210\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u4fee\u6b63\u673a\u5236\uff08\u4ec5\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u9519\u8bef\u65f6\u4fee\u6b63\uff09\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u6a21\u578b\u5d29\u6e83\u5e76\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660ePAG\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u548c\u4fee\u6b63\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u80fd\u529b\u4f18\u4e8e\u81ea\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "PAG\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u4fee\u6b63\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

It\nalso ensures that the shapes of newly generated local parts follow\nuser-specific geometric instructions (e.g., an isosceles right triangle or a\nrectangle with one corner cut off). However, existing methods encounter\nchallenges in achieving this goal. Specifically, they either lack the ability\nto follow textual instructions or are unable to focus on the local parts. To\naddress this limitation, we introduce GeoCAD, a user-friendly and local\ngeometry-controllable CAD generation method. Specifically, we first propose a\ncomplementary captioning strategy to generate geometric instructions for local\nparts. This strategy involves vertex-based and VLLM-based captioning for\nsystematically annotating simple and complex parts, respectively. In this way,\nwe caption $\\sim$221k different local parts in total. In the training stage,\ngiven a CAD model, we randomly mask a local part. Then, using its geometric\ninstruction and the remaining parts as input, we prompt large language models\n(LLMs) to predict the masked part. During inference, users can specify any\nlocal part for modification while adhering to a variety of predefined geometric\ninstructions.

Motivated by this principle, we introduce EyeRobot, a robotic system\nwith gaze behavior that emerges from the need to complete real-world tasks. We\ndevelop a mechanical eyeball that can freely rotate to observe its surroundings\nand train a gaze policy to control it using reinforcement learning. We\naccomplish this by first collecting teleoperated demonstrations paired with a\n360 camera. This data is imported into a simulation environment that supports\nrendering arbitrary eyeball viewpoints, allowing episode rollouts of eye gaze\non top of robot demonstrations. We then introduce a BC-RL loop to train the\nhand and eye jointly: the hand (BC) agent is trained from rendered eye\nobservations, and the eye (RL) agent is rewarded when the hand produces correct\naction predictions. In this way, hand-eye coordination emerges as the eye looks\ntowards regions which allow the hand to complete the task. EyeRobot implements\na foveal-inspired policy architecture allowing high resolution with a small\ncompute budget, which we find also leads to the emergence of more stable\nfixation as well as improved ability to track objects and ignore distractors.\nWe evaluate EyeRobot on five panoramic workspace manipulation tasks requiring\nmanipulation in an arc surrounding the robot arm. Our experiments suggest\nEyeRobot exhibits hand-eye coordination behaviors which effectively facilitate\nmanipulation over large workspaces with a single camera.

This is suboptimal because resampling can\nintroduce artifacts due to interpolation. To address this, we present\nRealKeyMorph (RKM), a resolution-agnostic method for image registration. RKM is\nan extension of KeyMorph, a registration framework which works by training a\nnetwork to learn corresponding keypoints for a given pair of images, after\nwhich a closed-form keypoint matching step is used to derive the transformation\nthat aligns them. To avoid resampling and enable operating on the raw data, RKM\noutputs keypoints in real-world coordinates of the scanner. To do this, we\nleverage the affine matrix produced by the scanner (e.g., MRI machine) that\nencodes the mapping from voxel coordinates to real world coordinates. By\ntransforming keypoints into real-world space and integrating this into the\ntraining process, RKM effectively enables the extracted keypoints to be\nresolution-agnostic.

Driven by this fundamental question, we present Tina, a family of tiny\nreasoning models achieved with high cost-efficiency. Notably, Tina demonstrates\nthat substantial reasoning performance can be developed using only minimal\nresources, by applying parameter-efficient updates during reinforcement\nlearning (RL), using low-rank adaptation (LoRA), to an already tiny 1.5B\nparameter base model. This minimalist approach produces models that achieve\nreasoning performance which is competitive with, and sometimes surpasses, SOTA\nRL reasoning models built upon the same base model. Crucially, this is achieved\nat a tiny fraction of the computational post-training cost employed by existing\nSOTA models.

We also pinpoint potential distinctions between the two concepts\nbuilding upon our framework, and make effort to close this gap. We introduce\ntwo independent architectural modifications within transformers.

The model\nachieves a mean burial depth error of approximately 10 centimeters and resolves\nspatial burial patterns that reflect underlying sediment transport processes.\nThis approach enables scalable, non-invasive mapping of seafloor burial and\nsupports environmental assessment at contaminated sites.", "AI": {"tldr": "PoseIDON\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u6444\u5f71\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4eceROV\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u4f30\u8ba1\u6d77\u5e95\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u516d\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u4f4d\u59ff\u53ca\u5468\u56f4\u6d77\u5e95\u7684\u671d\u5411\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u63a8\u65ad\u57cb\u85cf\u6df1\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u51c6\u786e\u4f30\u8ba1\u6d77\u5e95\u4eba\u4e3a\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u57cb\u85cf\u6df1\u5ea6\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u751f\u6001\u98ce\u9669\u3001\u6c61\u67d3\u7269\u8fc1\u79fb\u4ee5\u53ca\u5371\u9669\u6750\u6599\uff08\u5982\u5f39\u836f\uff09\u7684\u56de\u6536\u6216\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u90e8\u5206\u906e\u6321\u3001\u80fd\u89c1\u5ea6\u5dee\u548c\u7269\u4f53\u9000\u5316\uff0c\u4ece\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u4f30\u8ba1\u57cb\u85cf\u6df1\u5ea6\u4ecd\u7136\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "PoseIDON\u7ed3\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u6444\u5f71\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u7269\u4f53\u7684CAD\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u89c2\u6d4b\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5e76\u62df\u5408\u6d77\u5e95\u5c40\u90e8\u5e73\u9762\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u63a8\u65ad\u57cb\u85cf\u6df1\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u572854\u4e2a\u7269\u4f53\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u6876\u548c\u5f39\u836f\uff09\u7684\u5f55\u50cf\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u57cb\u85cf\u6df1\u5ea6\u8bef\u5dee\u7ea6\u4e3a10\u5398\u7c73\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u53cd\u6620\u5e95\u5c42\u6c89\u79ef\u7269\u8fc1\u79fb\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u57cb\u85cf\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "PoseIDON\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u7684\u6d77\u5e95\u57cb\u85cf\u6d4b\u7ed8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6c61\u67d3\u573a\u5730\u7684\u73af\u5883\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002"}}

However, existing FL-based clustering methods, known as\nfederated clustering, typically assume simple data partitioning scenarios such\nas horizontal or vertical splits, and cannot handle more complex distributed\nstructures. This study proposes data collaboration clustering (DC-Clustering),\na novel federated clustering method that supports clustering over complex data\npartitioning scenarios where horizontal and vertical splits coexist. In\nDC-Clustering, each institution shares only intermediate representations\ninstead of raw data, ensuring privacy preservation while enabling collaborative\nclustering. The method allows flexible selection between k-means and spectral\nclustering, and achieves final results with a single round of communication\nwith the central server.

Conventional methods\nface challenges due to sparse data, algorithmic complexity, and high\ncomputational costs, while increasing usage of machine learning (ML) method\nremains limited to reconstruction problems at the sea surface and local\nregions, struggling with issues like cloud occlusion. To address these\nlimitations, this paper proposes ReconMOST, a data-driven guided diffusion\nmodel framework for multi-layer sea temperature reconstruction. Specifically,\nwe first pre-train an unconditional diffusion model using a large collection of\nhistorical numerical simulation data, enabling the model to attain physically\nconsistent distribution patterns of ocean temperature fields. During the\ngeneration phase, sparse yet high-accuracy in-situ observational data are\nutilized as guidance points for the reverse diffusion process, generating\naccurate reconstruction results. Importantly, in regions lacking direct\nobservational data, the physically consistent spatial distribution patterns\nlearned during pre-training enable implicitly guided and physically plausible\nreconstructions. Our method extends ML-based SST reconstruction to a global,\nmulti-layer setting, handling over 92.5% missing data while maintaining\nreconstruction accuracy, spatial resolution, and superior generalization\ncapability. We pre-train our model on CMIP6 numerical simulation data and\nconduct guided reconstruction experiments on CMIP6 and EN4 analysis data. The\nresults of mean squared error (MSE) values achieve 0.049 on guidance, 0.680 on\nreconstruction, and 0.633 on total, respectively, demonstrating the\neffectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework.

However, compared to facial\nvideos, human body videos pose greater challenges due to their more complex and\ndiverse motion patterns, i.e., when using explicit motion guidance for\nGenerative Human Video Coding (GHVC), the reconstruction results could suffer\nsevere distortions and inaccurate motion. As such, this paper highlights the\nlimitations of explicit motion-based approaches for human body video\ncompression and investigates the GHVC performance improvement with the aid of\nImplicit Motion Transformation, namely IMT. In particular, we propose to\ncharacterize complex human body signal into compact visual features and\ntransform these features into implicit motion guidance for signal\nreconstruction.

To address this gap, we introduce PyLO, a\nPyTorch-based library that brings learned optimizers to the broader machine\nlearning community through familiar, widely adopted workflows. Unlike prior\nwork focused on synthetic or convex tasks, our emphasis is on applying learned\noptimization to real-world large-scale pre-training tasks.

In the domain of natural images, numerous transfer-based\nadversarial attack methods have been studied. However, HSIs differ from natural\nimages due to their high-dimensional and rich spectral information. Current\nresearch on HSI adversarial examples remains limited and faces challenges in\nfully utilizing the structural and feature information of images. To address\nthese issues, this paper proposes a novel method to enhance the transferability\nof the adversarial examples for HSI classification models. First, while keeping\nthe image structure unchanged, the proposed method randomly divides the image\ninto blocks in both spatial and spectral dimensions. Then, various\ntransformations are applied on a block by block basis to increase input\ndiversity and mitigate overfitting. Second, a feature distancing loss targeting\nintermediate layers is designed, which measures the distance between the\namplified features of the original examples and the features of the adversarial\nexamples as the primary loss, while the output layer prediction serves as the\nauxiliary loss. This guides the perturbation to disrupt the features of the\ntrue class in adversarial examples, effectively enhancing transferability.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that the adversarial examples generated by\nthe proposed method achieve effective transferability to black-box models on\ntwo public HSI datasets.

The framework is\nbuilt on the premise that irreversible evolution of material responses,\ngoverned by hidden dynamics, can be inferred from observable data.\n  We develop the History-Aware Neural Operator (HANO), an autoregressive model\nthat predicts path-dependent material responses from short segments of recent\nstrain-stress history without relying on hidden state variables, thereby\novercoming self-consistency issues commonly encountered in recurrent neural\nnetwork (RNN)-based models. Built on a Fourier-based neural operator backbone,\nHANO enables discretization-invariant learning. To enhance its ability to\ncapture both global loading patterns and critical local path dependencies, we\nembed a hierarchical self-attention mechanism that facilitates multiscale\nfeature extraction.\n  Beyond ensuring self-consistency, HANO mitigates sensitivity to initial\nhidden states, a commonly overlooked issue that can lead to instability in\nrecurrent models when applied to generalized loading paths. By modeling\nstress-strain evolution as a continuous operator rather than relying on fixed\ninput-output mappings, HANO naturally accommodates varying path discretizations\nand exhibits robust performance under complex conditions, including irregular\nsampling, multi-cycle loading, noisy data, and pre-stressed states. We evaluate\nHANO on two benchmark problems: elastoplasticity with hardening and progressive\nanisotropic damage in brittle solids.

A useful approach to assimilating measurement data into complex\ncoupled atmosphere-wildfire models is to estimate wildfire progression from\nmeasurements and use this progression to develop a matching atmospheric state.\nIn this study, an approach is developed for estimating fire progression from\nVIIRS active fire measurements, GOES-derived ignition times, and terrain height\ndata.

The model is\ntrained on tuples of fire arrival times, measurements, and terrain, and once\ntrained leverages measurements of real fires and corresponding terrain data to\ngenerate samples of fire arrival times. The approach is validated on five\nPacific US wildfires, with results compared against high-resolution perimeters\nmeasured via aircraft, finding an average Sorensen-Dice coefficient of 0.81.\nThe influence of terrain height on the arrival time inference is also evaluated\nand it is observed that terrain has minimal influence when the inference is\nconditioned on satellite measurements.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u536b\u661f\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5730\u5f62\u4fe1\u606f\u9884\u6d4b\u91ce\u706b\u8513\u5ef6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u6297\u7f51\u7edc\uff08GAN\uff09\u7ed3\u5408WRF-SFIRE\u6a21\u578b\u7269\u7406\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u91ce\u706b\u5230\u8fbe\u65f6\u95f4\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u91ce\u706b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u65e5\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u4e0e\u89c2\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u5b58\u5728\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6570\u636e\u540c\u5316\u6280\u672f\u6539\u8fdb\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u6297\u7f51\u7edc\uff08cGAN\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408VIIRS\u6d3b\u8dc3\u706b\u70b9\u6570\u636e\u3001GOES\u70b9\u706b\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u5730\u5f62\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u4f30\u8ba1\u91ce\u706b\u5230\u8fbe\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u592a\u5e73\u6d0b\u7f8e\u56fd\u91ce\u706b\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e73\u5747Sorensen-Dice\u7cfb\u6570\u4e3a0.81\uff0c\u5730\u5f62\u5bf9\u9884\u6d4b\u5f71\u54cd\u8f83\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u7269\u7406\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u91ce\u706b\u8513\u5ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

Our\ntheoretical analysis shows that the OCR capability can be attributed to the\nimplicit bias of gradient descent, which favors solutions that minimize the\nnuclear norm of the combined output-value matrix.

While recent advances using large language models (LLMs) have shown\npromising results, methods for automatically evaluating autoformalization\nremain underexplored. As one moves to more complex domains (e.g., advanced\nmathematics), human evaluation requires significant time and domain expertise,\nespecially as the complexity of the underlying statements and background\nknowledge increases. LLM-as-a-judge presents a promising approach for\nautomating such evaluation. However, existing methods typically employ\ncoarse-grained and generic evaluation criteria, which limit their effectiveness\nfor advanced formal mathematical reasoning, where quality hinges on nuanced,\nmulti-granular dimensions. In this work, we take a step toward addressing this\ngap by introducing a systematic, automatic method to evaluate autoformalization\ntasks. The proposed method is based on an epistemically and formally grounded\nensemble (EFG) of LLM judges, defined on criteria encompassing logical\npreservation (LP), mathematical consistency (MC), formal validity (FV), and\nformal quality (FQ), resulting in a transparent assessment that accounts for\ndifferent contributing factors.

We then present analyses from a situated collaborative task that\ndemonstrate how this model of epistemic friction can effectively predict belief\nupdates in dialogues, and we subsequently discuss how the model of belief\nalignment as a measure of epistemic resistance or friction can naturally be\nmade more sophisticated to accommodate the complexities of real-world dialogue\nscenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e2d\u7684\u201c\u8ba4\u77e5\u6469\u64e6\u201d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u52a8\u6001\u8ba4\u77e5\u6469\u64e6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5728\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u8ba4\u77e5\u6469\u64e6\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5373\u66f4\u65b0\u4fe1\u5ff5\u65f6\u5bf9\u65b0\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u62b5\u6297\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u8ba4\u77e5\u903b\u8f91\u5b9a\u4e49\u52a8\u6001\u8ba4\u77e5\u6469\u64e6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u6790\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u9884\u6d4b\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u5ff5\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u52a8\u6001\u8ba4\u77e5\u6469\u64e6\u6a21\u578b\u4e3aLLMs\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u3002"}}

This practice is\nstatistically brittle: it ignores sampling error and treats small demographic\nsubgroups the same as large ones. The problem intensifies in intersectional\nanalyses, where multiple sensitive attributes are considered jointly, giving\nrise to a larger number of smaller groups. As these groups become more\ngranular, the data representing them becomes too sparse for reliable\nestimation, and fairness metrics yield excessively wide confidence intervals,\nprecluding meaningful conclusions about potential unfair treatments.\n  In this paper, we introduce a unified, size-adaptive, hypothesis-testing\nframework that turns fairness assessment into an evidence-based statistical\ndecision. Our contribution is twofold. (i) For sufficiently large subgroups, we\nprove a Central-Limit result for the statistical parity difference, leading to\nanalytic confidence intervals and a Wald test whose type-I (false positive)\nerror is guaranteed at level $\\alpha$.

While CLIP is capable of making image\nfeatures to be similar to the corresponding text features, the modality gap\nremains a nontrivial issue and limits image recognition performance of TaI.\nUsing multi-label image recognition (MLR) as an example, we present a novel\nmethod, called T2I-PAL to tackle the modality gap issue when using only text\ncaptions for PEFT. The core design of T2I-PAL is to leverage pre-trained\ntext-to-image generation models to generate photo-realistic and diverse images\nfrom text captions, thereby reducing the modality gap. To further enhance MLR,\nT2I-PAL incorporates a class-wise heatmap and learnable prototypes. This\naggregates local similarities, making the representation of local visual\nfeatures more robust and informative for multi-label recognition. For better\nPEFT, we further combine both prompt tuning and adapter learning to enhance\nclassification performance.

Standard diffusion models rely on isotropic Gaussian noise\nin the forward process, inherently favoring Euclidean spaces. However, many\nreal-world problems involve non-Euclidean distributions, such as hyperspherical\nmanifolds, where class-specific patterns are governed by angular geometry\nwithin hypercones. When modeled in Euclidean space, these angular subtleties\nare lost, leading to suboptimal generative performance.

We show that models are\neffective at identifying most unhelpful thoughts but struggle to recover from\nthe same thoughts when these are injected into their thinking process, causing\nsignificant performance drops.

In this paper, we\npropose a novel hierarchical error assessment framework for aircraft CAD models\nwithin a manufacturing-and-measurement platform, termed HEA-MM. HEA-MM employs\nstructured light scanners to obtain comprehensive 3D measurements of\nmanufactured workpieces. The measured point cloud is registered with the\nreference CAD model, followed by an error analysis conducted at three\nhierarchical levels: global, part, and feature. At the global level, the error\nanalysis evaluates the overall deviation of the scanned point cloud from the\nreference CAD model. At the part level, error analysis is performed on these\npatches underlying the point clouds. We propose a novel optimization-based\nprimitive refinement method to obtain a set of meaningful patches of point\nclouds. Two basic operations, splitting and merging, are introduced to refine\nthe coarse primitives. At the feature level, error analysis is performed on\ncircular holes, which are commonly found in CAD models. To facilitate it, a\ntwo-stage algorithm is introduced for the detection of circular holes. First,\nedge points are identified using a tensor-voting algorithm.

Existing text-to-texture synthesis\napproaches utilize depth-aware diffusion models to progressively generate\nimages and synthesize textures across predefined multiple viewpoints. However,\nthese approaches lead to a gradual shift in texture properties across\nviewpoints due to (1) insufficient integration of previously synthesized\ntextures at each viewpoint during the diffusion process and (2) the\nautoregressive nature of the texture synthesis process. Moreover, the\npredefined selection of camera positions, which does not account for the\nobject's geometry, limits the effective use of texture information synthesized\nfrom different viewpoints, ultimately degrading overall texture consistency. In\nTexTailor, we address these issues by (1) applying a resampling scheme that\nrepeatedly integrates information from previously synthesized textures within\nthe diffusion process, and (2) fine-tuning a depth-aware diffusion model on\nthese resampled textures. During this process, we observed that using only a\nfew training images restricts the model's original ability to generate\nhigh-fidelity images aligned with the conditioning, and therefore propose an\nperformance preservation loss to mitigate this issue. Additionally, we improve\nthe synthesis of view-consistent textures by adaptively adjusting camera\npositions based on the object's geometry.

In addition, well-known prototype-based approaches typically learn\nextremely granular prototypes that are less interpretable in medical imaging,\nwhere both the presence and extent of biomarkers and lesions are critical.\n  Methods: To address these challenges, we propose PiPViT (Patch-based Visual\nInterpretable Prototypes), an inherently interpretable prototypical model for\nimage recognition. Leveraging a vision transformer (ViT), PiPViT captures\nlong-range dependencies among patches to learn robust, human-interpretable\nprototypes that approximate lesion extent only using image-level labels.\nAdditionally, PiPViT benefits from contrastive learning and multi-resolution\ninput processing, which enables effective localization of biomarkers across\nscales.\n  Results: We evaluated PiPViT on retinal OCT image classification across four\ndatasets, where it achieved competitive quantitative performance compared to\nstate-of-the-art methods while delivering more meaningful explanations.\nMoreover, quantitative evaluation on a hold-out test set confirms that the\nlearned prototypes are semantically and clinically relevant. We believe PiPViT\ncan transparently explain its decisions and assist clinicians in understanding\ndiagnostic outcomes.

We begin by describing a broad class of such models --\nstate space models -- as those whose state updates can be computed using the\nclassic parallel prefix scan algorithm with a custom associative aggregation\noperator.

While prior work has primarily\nfocused on architectural innovations, the influence of data-level factors on\nunlearning performance remains underexplored. As a result, existing methods\noften suffer from degraded retention when forgetting high-impact data. To\naddress this, we propose GUARD-a novel framework for Guided Unlearning And\nRetention via Data attribution. At its core, GUARD introduces a lightweight\nproxy data attribution metric tailored for LLM unlearning, which quantifies the\n\"alignment\" between the forget and retain sets while remaining computationally\nefficient. Building on this, we design a novel unlearning objective that\nassigns adaptive, nonuniform unlearning weights to samples, inversely\nproportional to their proxy attribution scores. Through such a reallocation of\nunlearning power, GUARD mitigates unintended losses in retention.

First, instead of estimating\nthe adaptation parameters with cross-entropy on a single error-prone hypothesis\nor \"pseudo-label\", this paper proposes a novel loss function, the conditional\nentropy over complete hypotheses. Using multiple hypotheses makes adaptation\nmore robust to errors in the initial recognition. Second, a \"speaker code\"\ncharacterises a speaker in a vector short enough that it requires little data\nto estimate. On a far-field noise-augmented version of Common Voice, the\nproposed scheme yields a 20% relative improvement in word error rate on one\nminute of adaptation data, increasing on 10 minutes to 29%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u6761\u4ef6\u71b5\u548c\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u5c11\u91cf\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u5668\u9002\u5e94\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u5668\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u73af\u5883\u6216\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\uff0c\u4f46\u9002\u5e94\u6570\u636e\u5f80\u5f80\u4e0d\u8db3\u4e14\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u9c81\u68d2\u3002", "method": "1. \u4f7f\u7528\u6761\u4ef6\u71b5\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u66ff\u4ee3\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u5047\u8bbe\u51cf\u5c11\u521d\u59cb\u8bc6\u522b\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b2. \u5f15\u5165\u77ed\u5411\u91cf\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8fdc\u573a\u566a\u58f0\u589e\u5f3a\u7684Common Voice\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c1\u5206\u949f\u9002\u5e94\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u8bcd\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u76f8\u5bf9\u6539\u558420%\uff0c10\u5206\u949f\u4e0b\u6539\u558429%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5c11\u91cf\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u5668\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

Central to recent ZSGM approaches are directional loss\nwhich use the text guidance in the form of aligning the image offset with text\noffset in the embedding space of a vision-language model like CLIP. This is\nsimilar to the analogical reasoning in NLP where the offset between one pair of\nwords is used to identify a missing element in another pair by aligning the\noffset between these two pairs. However, a major limitation of existing ZSGM\nmethods is that the learning objective assumes the complete alignment between\nimage offset and text offset in the CLIP embedding space, resulting in quality\ndegrade in generated images. Our work makes two main contributions. Inspired by\nthe offset misalignment studies in NLP, as our first contribution, we perform\nan empirical study to analyze the misalignment between text offset and image\noffset in CLIP embedding space for various large publicly available datasets.\nOur important finding is that offset misalignment in CLIP embedding space is\ncorrelated with concept distance, i.e., close concepts have a less offset\nmisalignment. To address the limitations of the current approaches, as our\nsecond contribution, we propose Adaptation with Iterative Refinement (AIR)\nwhich is the first ZSGM approach to focus on improving target domain image\nquality based on our new insight on offset misalignment.Qualitative,\nquantitative, and user study in 26 experiment setups consistently demonstrate\nthe proposed AIR approach achieves SOTA performance.

While function spaces are\ntypically infinite-dimensional, deep learning has predominantly advanced\nthrough applications in computer vision and natural language processing that\nfocus on mappings between finite-dimensional spaces. Such fundamental\ndisparities in the nature of the data have limited neural networks from\nachieving a comparable level of success in scientific applications as seen in\nother fields. Neural operators are a principled way to generalize neural\nnetworks to mappings between function spaces, offering a pathway to replicate\ndeep learning's transformative impact on scientific problems. For instance,\nneural operators can learn solution operators for entire classes of PDEs, e.g.,\nphysical systems with different boundary conditions, coefficient functions, and\ngeometries. A key factor in deep learning's success has been the careful\nengineering of neural architectures through extensive empirical testing.\nTranslating these neural architectures into neural operators allows operator\nlearning to enjoy these same empirical optimizations.

Many works aim to address this issue by\nremoving redundant visual tokens. However, current approaches either rely on\nattention-based pruning, which retains numerous duplicate tokens, or use\nsimilarity-based pruning, overlooking the instruction relevance, consequently\ncausing suboptimal performance. In this paper, we go beyond attention or\nsimilarity by proposing a novel visual token pruning method named CDPruner,\nwhich maximizes the conditional diversity of retained tokens. We first define\nthe conditional similarity between visual tokens conditioned on the\ninstruction, and then reformulate the token pruning problem with determinantal\npoint process (DPP) to maximize the conditional diversity of the selected\nsubset. The proposed CDPruner is training-free and model-agnostic, allowing\neasy application to various MLLMs. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLMs\nshow that CDPruner establishes new state-of-the-art on various vision-language\nbenchmarks. By maximizing conditional diversity through DPP, the selected\nsubset better represents the input images while closely adhering to user\ninstructions, thereby preserving strong performance even with high reduction\nratios.

As a result, treatment replanning is often required\nto maintain clinically acceptable treatment quality. However, current manual\nreplanning processes are resource-intensive and time-consuming. We propose a\npatient-specific deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for automated IMPT\nreplanning, with a reward-shaping mechanism based on a $150$-point plan quality\nscore addressing competing clinical objectives. We formulate the planning\nprocess as an RL problem where agents learn control policies to adjust\noptimization priorities, maximizing plan quality. Unlike population-based\napproaches, our framework trains personalized agents for each patient using\ntheir planning CT (Computed Tomography) and augmented anatomies simulating\nanatomical changes (tumor progression and regression). This patient-specific\napproach leverages anatomical similarities throughout treatment, enabling\neffective plan adaptation. We implemented two DRL algorithms, Deep Q-Network\nand Proximal Policy Optimization, using dose-volume histograms (DVHs) as state\nrepresentations and a $22$-dimensional action space of priority adjustments.\nEvaluation on five HNC patients using actual replanning CT data showed both DRL\nagents improved initial plan scores from $120.63 \\pm 21.40$ to $139.78 \\pm\n6.84$ (DQN) and $142.74 \\pm 5.16$ (PPO), surpassing manual replans generated by\na human planner ($137.20 \\pm 5.58$). Clinical validation confirms that\nimprovements translate to better tumor coverage and OAR sparing across diverse\nanatomical changes.

We\ndemonstrate that the training can be accelerated with two techniques --\npretraining with an expert policy (here, linear control) and task-level\ntransfer learning (here, extending a policy trained on isolated gusts to\nmultiple gusts). We show that the learned strategy outperforms the best\nproportional control, with the performance gap widening as the number of gusts\nincreases. The control strategy learned in an environment with a small number\nof successive gusts is shown to effectively generalize to an environment with\nan arbitrarily long sequence of gusts. We investigate the pivot configuration\nand show that quarter-chord pitching control can achieve superior lift\nregulation with substantially less control effort compared to mid-chord\npitching control. Through a decomposition of the lift, we attribute this\nadvantage to the dominant added-mass contribution accessible via quarter-chord\npitching. The success on multiple configurations shows the generalizability of\nthe proposed transformer-based RL framework, which offers a promising approach\nto solve more computationally demanding flow control problems when combined\nwith the proposed acceleration techniques.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u5f3a\u6270\u52a8\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u4fef\u4ef0\u63a7\u5236\u8c03\u8282\u6c14\u52a8\u5347\u529b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u90e8\u5206\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u7ea7\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u52a0\u901f\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ebf\u6027\u6d41\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u5f3a\u6270\u52a8\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u4ee5\u501f\u52a9\u5176\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Transformer-based RL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u7ea7\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u4e8e\u6bd4\u4f8b\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u4efb\u610f\u957f\u6270\u52a8\u5e8f\u5217\uff1b\u56db\u5206\u4e4b\u4e00\u5f26\u957f\u4fef\u4ef0\u63a7\u5236\u6548\u679c\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u5177\u6709\u901a\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u52a0\u901f\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u89e3\u51b3\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u6d41\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Our weakly\nsupervised approach integrates synthetically generated pseudo-pathology images\ninto the modeling process to better guide the reconstruction of healthy images.\nTo generate these pseudo-pathologies, we apply fluid-driven anomaly\nrandomization to augment real pathology segmentation maps from an auxiliary\ndataset, ensuring that the synthetic anomalies are both realistic and\nanatomically coherent. We evaluate our model's ability to detect pathology,\nusing both synthetic anomaly datasets and real pathology from the ATLAS\ndataset.

Specifically, we achieve\nreal-time estimation of RG'G and RBS under two relaxed assumptions: i) the\nmatrices change negligibly in a short time window; ii) the human movements/IMU\nreadings are diverse in such a time window. Intuitively, the first assumption\nreduces the number of candidate matrices, and the second assumption provides\ndiverse constraints, which greatly reduces the solution space and allows for\naccurate estimation of RG'G and RBS from a short history of IMU readings in\nreal time. To achieve this, we created synthetic datasets of paired RG'G, RBS\nmatrices and IMU readings, and learned their mappings using a Transformer-based\nmodel. We also designed a calibration trigger based on the diversity of IMU\nreadings to ensure that assumption ii) is met before applying our method.

Building upon GNN-based KGRSs, Self-Supervised Learning (SSL)\nhas been incorporated to address the sparity issue, leading to longer training\ntime. However, through extensive experiments, we reveal that: (1)compared to\nother KGRSs, the existing GNN-based KGRSs fail to keep their superior\nperformance under sparse interactions even with SSL. (2) More complex models\ntend to perform worse in sparse interaction scenarios and complex mechanisms,\nlike attention mechanism, can be detrimental as they often increase learning\ndifficulty. Inspired by these findings, we propose LightKG, a simple yet\npowerful GNN-based KGRS to address sparsity issues. LightKG includes a\nsimplified GNN layer that encodes directed relations as scalar pairs rather\nthan dense embeddings and employs a linear aggregation framework, greatly\nreducing the complexity of GNNs. Additionally, LightKG incorporates an\nefficient contrastive layer to implement SSL. It directly minimizes the node\nsimilarity in original graph, avoiding the time-consuming subgraph generation\nand comparison required in previous SSL methods.

Previous methods can be broadly\nclassified into three categories: convolutional neural network (CNN) based,\nTransformer based, and hybrid architectures that combine both. However, each of\nthem has its own limitations, such as restricted receptive fields in CNNs or\nthe computational overhead caused by the quadratic complexity of Transformers.\nRecently, the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) model has emerged as a\npromising alternative for various vision tasks, offering strong long-range\nmodeling capabilities with linear computational complexity. Some studies have\nalso adapted RWKV to medical image segmentation tasks, achieving competitive\nperformance. However, most of these studies focus on modifications to the\nVision-RWKV (VRWKV) mechanism and train models from scratch, without exploring\nthe potential advantages of leveraging pre-trained VRWKV models for medical\nimage segmentation tasks. In this paper, we propose Med-URWKV, a pure\nRWKV-based architecture built upon the U-Net framework, which incorporates\nImageNet-based pretraining to further explore the potential of RWKV in medical\nimage segmentation tasks. To the best of our knowledge, Med-URWKV is the first\npure RWKV segmentation model in the medical field that can directly reuse a\nlarge-scale pre-trained VRWKV encoder. Experimental results on seven datasets\ndemonstrate that Med-URWKV achieves comparable or even superior segmentation\nperformance compared to other carefully optimized RWKV models trained from\nscratch.

Topological Evolution Dynamics (TED) has recently emerged as a\npowerful tool for detecting backdoor attacks in DNNs.

In this work, we present the first\ncomprehensive, large-scale study of user feedback on AI-powered mobile apps,\nleveraging a curated dataset of 292 AI-driven apps across 14 categories with\n894K AI-specific reviews from Google Play. We develop and validate a\nmulti-stage analysis pipeline that begins with a human-labeled benchmark and\nsystematically evaluates large language models (LLMs) and prompting strategies.\nEach stage, including review classification, aspect-sentiment extraction, and\nclustering, is validated for accuracy and consistency. Our pipeline enables\nscalable, high-precision analysis of user feedback, extracting over one million\naspect-sentiment pairs clustered into 18 positive and 15 negative user topics.\nOur analysis reveals that users consistently focus on a narrow set of themes:\npositive comments emphasize productivity, reliability, and personalized\nassistance, while negative feedback highlights technical failures (e.g.,\nscanning and recognition), pricing concerns, and limitations in language\nsupport. Our pipeline surfaces both satisfaction with one feature and\nfrustration with another within the same review. These fine-grained,\nco-occurring sentiments are often missed by traditional approaches that treat\npositive and negative feedback in isolation or rely on coarse-grained analysis.\nTo this end, our approach provides a more faithful reflection of the real-world\nuser experiences with AI-powered apps.

Comparative approaches like pairwise and listwise achieve high\neffectiveness but are computationally intensive and thus less practical for\nlarger-scale applications. Scoring-based pointwise approaches exhibit superior\nefficiency by independently and simultaneously generating the relevance scores\nfor each candidate document. However, this independence ignores critical\ncomparative insights between documents, resulting in inconsistent scoring and\nsuboptimal performance. In this paper, we aim to improve the effectiveness of\npointwise methods while preserving their efficiency through two key\ninnovations: (1) We propose a novel Global-Consistent Comparative Pointwise\nRanking (GCCP) strategy that incorporates global reference comparisons between\neach candidate and an anchor document to generate contrastive relevance scores.\nWe strategically design the anchor document as a query-focused summary of\npseudo-relevant candidates, which serves as an effective reference point by\ncapturing the global context for document comparison. (2) These contrastive\nrelevance scores can be efficiently Post-Aggregated with existing pointwise\nmethods, seamlessly integrating essential Global Context information in a\ntraining-free manner (PAGC).

To facilitate our study\nof monitoring decomposition attacks, we curate the largest and most diverse\ndataset to date, including question-answering, text-to-image, and agentic\ntasks.

However, the traditional process for creating\nsuch benchmarks is notoriously challenging and labor-intensive, particularly in\nthe stages of setting up evaluation environments, grading test outcomes, and\nvalidating task instances. In this paper, we propose SWE-Factory, an automated\npipeline designed to address these challenges. To tackle these issues, our\npipeline integrates three core automated components. First, we introduce\nSWE-Builder, a multi-agent system that automates evaluation environment\nconstruction, which employs four specialized agents that work in a\ncollaborative, iterative loop and leverages an environment memory pool to\nenhance efficiency. Second, we introduce a standardized, exit-code-based\ngrading method that eliminates the need for manually writing custom parsers.\nFinally, we automate the fail2pass validation process using these reliable exit\ncode signals. Experiments on 671 issues across four programming languages show\nthat our pipeline can effectively construct valid task instances; for example,\nwith GPT-4.1-mini, our SWE-Builder constructs 269 valid instances at $0.045 per\ninstance, while with Gemini-2.5-flash, it achieves comparable performance at\nthe lowest cost of $0.024 per instance. We also demonstrate that our\nexit-code-based grading achieves 100% accuracy compared to manual inspection,\nand our automated fail2pass validation reaches a precision of 0.92 and a recall\nof 1.00. We hope our automated pipeline will accelerate the collection of\nlarge-scale, high-quality GitHub issue resolution datasets for both training\nand evaluation.

Assuming no score error nor discretization error, we derive an explicit\nsolution to the guided reverse dynamics, so that how guidance influences the\nsampling behavior can be precisely characterized. When the full data\ndistribution is a mixture over classes and the goal is to sample from a\nspecific class, guidance amplifies class-specific regions while suppresses\nregions shared with other classes. This effect depends on the guidance strength\n$w$ and induces distinct covariance structures in the sampled distribution.\nNotably, we observe quantitatively different behaviors in $1$D and $2$D. We\nalso show that for large $w$, the decay rate of the total variation\n($\\mathrm{TV}$) along the reverse dynamics is double-exponential in $w$ for\nboth $1$D and $2$D. These findings highlight the role of guidance, not just in\nshaping the output distribution, but also in controlling the dynamics of the\nsampling trajectory.

### [1] [Agentic Design Review System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10745)
*Sayan Nag,K J Joseph,Koustava Goswami,Vlad I Morariu,Balaji Vasan Srinivasan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种多代理协作的图形设计评估系统（AgenticDRS），通过图匹配和提示扩展方法提升代理的设计感知能力，并在DRS-BENCH基准上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图形设计评估需要多维度综合反馈，但目前缺乏系统化的方法。

Method: 采用多代理协作框架，结合图匹配和提示扩展技术，由元代理协调分析。

Result: 实验表明AgenticDRS在评估图形设计和生成可操作反馈方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该研究为图形设计评估提供了新思路，并呼吁关注这一实用但未被充分探索的方向。

Abstract: Evaluating graphic designs involves assessing it from multiple facets like
alignment, composition, aesthetics and color choices. Evaluating designs in a
holistic way involves aggregating feedback from individual expert reviewers.
Towards this, we propose an Agentic Design Review System (AgenticDRS), where
multiple agents collaboratively analyze a design, orchestrated by a meta-agent.
A novel in-context exemplar selection approach based on graph matching and a
unique prompt expansion method plays central role towards making each agent
design aware. Towards evaluating this framework, we propose DRS-BENCH
benchmark. Thorough experimental evaluation against state-of-the-art baselines
adapted to the problem setup, backed-up with critical ablation experiments
brings out the efficacy of Agentic-DRS in evaluating graphic designs and
generating actionable feedback. We hope that this work will attract attention
to this pragmatic, yet under-explored research direction.

cleaned the datasets and constructed a new leaderboard with fair performance
evaluation in terms of base LLM model and datasets. We also build an online
portal that integrates resources of cleaned datasets, code and paper repository
to benefit the community. Finally, we identify limitations in current
methodologies and outline future research opportunities.

### [3] [Modeling Human Responses to Multimodal AI Content](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10769)
*Zhiqi Shen,Shaojing Fan,Danni Xu,Terence Sim,Mohan Kankanhalli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文研究了AI生成内容对人类行为和感知的影响，提出了MhAIM数据集和T-Lens系统，通过新指标量化用户对内容的判断，并提出了缓解AI误导风险的策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI生成内容的普及，其可能带来的误导风险增加。现有研究多关注内容真实性，而较少探讨其对人类行为和感知的影响，尤其是在交易或股市等领域。

Method: 研究采用以人为中心的方法，构建了包含154,552条在线帖子（其中111,153条为AI生成）的MhAIM数据集，并提出了信任度、影响力和开放性三个新指标。开发了基于LLM的T-Lens系统，其核心是HR-MCP协议。

Result: 研究发现，当帖子同时包含文本和视觉内容时，人们更容易识别AI生成内容，尤其是当两者不一致时。T-Lens系统通过预测人类反应提升了交互能力。

Conclusion: 研究为LLM提供了人类感知能力，揭示了AI、人类认知和信息接收之间的复杂关系，并提出了缓解AI误导风险的实际策略。

Abstract: As AI-generated content becomes widespread, so does the risk of
misinformation. While prior research has primarily focused on identifying
whether content is authentic, much less is known about how such content
influences human perception and behavior. In domains like trading or the stock
market, predicting how people react (e.g., whether a news post will go viral),
can be more critical than verifying its factual accuracy. To address this, we
take a human-centered approach and introduce the MhAIM Dataset, which contains
154,552 online posts (111,153 of them AI-generated), enabling large-scale
analysis of how people respond to AI-generated content. Our human study reveals
that people are better at identifying AI content when posts include both text
and visuals, particularly when inconsistencies exist between the two. We
propose three new metrics: trustworthiness, impact, and openness, to quantify
how users judge and engage with online content. We present T-Lens, an LLM-based
agent system designed to answer user queries by incorporating predicted human
responses to multimodal information. At its core is HR-MCP (Human Response
Model Context Protocol), built on the standardized Model Context Protocol
(MCP), enabling seamless integration with any LLM. This integration allows
T-Lens to better align with human reactions, enhancing both interpretability
and interaction capabilities. Our work provides empirical insights and
practical tools to equip LLMs with human-awareness capabilities. By
highlighting the complex interplay among AI, human cognition, and information
reception, our findings suggest actionable strategies for mitigating the risks
of AI-driven misinformation.

Abstract: AI systems for software development are rapidly gaining prominence, yet
significant challenges remain in ensuring their safety. To address this, Amazon
launched the Trusted AI track of the Amazon Nova AI Challenge, a global
competition among 10 university teams to drive advances in secure AI. In the
challenge, five teams focus on developing automated red teaming bots, while the
other five create safe AI assistants. This challenge provides teams with a
unique platform to evaluate automated red-teaming and safety alignment methods
through head-to-head adversarial tournaments where red teams have multi-turn
conversations with the competing AI coding assistants to test their safety
alignment. Along with this, the challenge provides teams with a feed of high
quality annotated data to fuel iterative improvement. Throughout the challenge,
teams developed state-of-the-art techniques, introducing novel approaches in
reasoning-based safety alignment, robust model guardrails, multi-turn
jail-breaking, and efficient probing of large language models (LLMs). To
support these efforts, the Amazon Nova AI Challenge team made substantial
scientific and engineering investments, including building a custom baseline
coding specialist model for the challenge from scratch, developing a tournament
orchestration service, and creating an evaluation harness. This paper outlines
the advancements made by university teams and the Amazon Nova AI Challenge team
in addressing the safety challenges of AI for software development,
highlighting this collaborative effort to raise the bar for AI safety.

### [5] [MCP-Orchestrated Multi-Agent System for Automated Disinformation Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10143)
*Alexandru-Andrei Avram,Adrian Groza,Alexandru Lecu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多智能体系统，通过关系提取检测新闻标题和短文本中的虚假信息，结合四种智能体，准确率达95.3%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字平台上虚假信息的广泛传播对信息完整性构成挑战，需要高效检测方法。

Method: 系统包含四个智能体：机器学习（逻辑回归）、维基百科知识检查（命名实体识别）、一致性检测（LLM提示工程）和网络数据抓取分析（关系三元组提取），通过MCP协议协调。

Result: 多智能体系统准确率95.3%，F1分数0.964，优于传统方法。加权聚合方法表现更优。

Conclusion: 模块化架构使系统易于扩展，同时保留决策过程细节，为虚假信息检测提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: The large spread of disinformation across digital platforms creates
significant challenges to information integrity. This paper presents a
multi-agent system that uses relation extraction to detect disinformation in
news articles, focusing on titles and short text snippets. The proposed Agentic
AI system combines four agents: (i) a machine learning agent (logistic
regression), (ii) a Wikipedia knowledge check agent (which relies on named
entity recognition), (iii) a coherence detection agent (using LLM prompt
engineering), and (iv) a web-scraped data analyzer that extracts relational
triplets for fact checking. The system is orchestrated via the Model Context
Protocol (MCP), offering shared context and live learning across components.
Results demonstrate that the multi-agent ensemble achieves 95.3% accuracy with
an F1 score of 0.964, significantly outperforming individual agents and
traditional approaches. The weighted aggregation method, mathematically derived
from individual agent misclassification rates, proves superior to algorithmic
threshold optimization. The modular architecture makes the system easily
scalable, while also maintaining details of the decision processes.

Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has ushered in a transformative
paradigm in artificial intelligence, Agentic AI, where intelligent agents
exhibit goal-directed autonomy, contextual reasoning, and dynamic multi-agent
coordination. This paper provides a systematic review and comparative analysis
of leading Agentic AI frameworks, including CrewAI, LangGraph, AutoGen,
Semantic Kernel, Agno, Google ADK, and MetaGPT, evaluating their architectural
principles, communication mechanisms, memory management, safety guardrails, and
alignment with service-oriented computing paradigms. Furthermore, we identify
key limitations, emerging trends, and open challenges in the field. To address
the issue of agent communication, we conduct an in-depth analysis of protocols
such as the Contract Net Protocol (CNP), Agent-to-Agent (A2A), Agent Network
Protocol (ANP), and Agora. Our findings not only establish a foundational
taxonomy for Agentic AI systems but also propose future research directions to
enhance scalability, robustness, and interoperability. This work serves as a
comprehensive reference for researchers and practitioners working to advance
the next generation of autonomous AI systems.

### [7] [Improving and Evaluating Open Deep Research Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10152)
*Doaa Allabadi,Kyle Bradbury,Jordan M. Malof*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究了开源深度研究代理（ODR）与闭源系统在BrowseComp-Small基准上的表现，通过改进ODR提出了ODR+模型，其性能优于现有系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度研究代理（DRAs）多为闭源系统，缺乏开源选项，限制了学术研究。本文旨在通过开源ODR模型填补这一空白，并改进其性能。

Method: 提出BrowseComp-Small（BC-Small）作为更易处理的基准，比较ODR与闭源系统（Anthropic和Google）的表现。通过三项改进策略提升ODR性能，得到ODR+模型。

Result: ODR和闭源系统在BC-Small测试集上准确率为0%，改进后的ODR+达到10%的成功率，优于所有系统。

Conclusion: ODR+在开源和闭源系统中表现最佳，三项改进策略均有效，为学术研究提供了可行的开源DRA解决方案。

Abstract: We focus here on Deep Research Agents (DRAs), which are systems that can take
a natural language prompt from a user, and then autonomously search for, and
utilize, internet-based content to address the prompt. Recent DRAs have
demonstrated impressive capabilities on public benchmarks however, recent
research largely involves proprietary closed-source systems. At the time of
this work, we only found one open-source DRA, termed Open Deep Research (ODR).
In this work we adapt the challenging recent BrowseComp benchmark to compare
ODR to existing proprietary systems. We propose BrowseComp-Small (BC-Small),
comprising a subset of BrowseComp, as a more computationally-tractable DRA
benchmark for academic labs. We benchmark ODR and two other proprietary systems
on BC-Small: one system from Anthropic and one system from Google. We find that
all three systems achieve 0% accuracy on the test set of 60 questions. We
introduce three strategic improvements to ODR, resulting in the ODR+ model,
which achieves a state-of-the-art 10% success rate on BC-Small among both
closed-source and open-source systems. We report ablation studies indicating
that all three of our improvements contributed to the success of ODR+.

### [8] [Pruning Long Chain-of-Thought of Large Reasoning Models via Small-Scale Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10164)
*Bin Hong,Jiayu Liu,Zhenya Huang,Kai Zhang,Mengdi Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为LCPO的方法，通过控制输出长度来优化大型推理模型的效率，同时保持推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）的长推理链增加了计算成本并可能导致过度思考，当前方法在效率与质量间难以平衡。

Method: 分析生成路径分布并通过难度估计过滤轨迹，研究偏好优化方法的收敛行为，提出LCPO方法直接平衡隐式奖励与NLL损失。

Result: 实验表明，LCPO在多个基准测试中平均输出长度减少50%以上，同时保持推理性能。

Conclusion: LCPO展示了在有限数据和训练下高效引导LRMs的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated strong
performance on complex tasks through long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning.
However, their lengthy outputs increase computational costs and may lead to
overthinking, raising challenges in balancing reasoning effectiveness and
efficiency. Current methods for efficient reasoning often compromise reasoning
quality or require extensive resources. This paper investigates efficient
methods to reduce the generation length of LRMs. We analyze generation path
distributions and filter generated trajectories through difficulty estimation.
Subsequently, we analyze the convergence behaviors of the objectives of various
preference optimization methods under a Bradley-Terry loss based framework.
Based on the analysis, we propose Length Controlled Preference Optimization
(LCPO) that directly balances the implicit reward related to NLL loss. LCPO can
effectively learn length preference with limited data and training. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces the average
output length by over 50\% across multiple benchmarks while maintaining the
reasoning performance. Our work highlights the potential for computationally
efficient approaches in guiding LRMs toward efficient reasoning.

### [9] [KompeteAI: Accelerated Autonomous Multi-Agent System for End-to-End Pipeline Generation for Machine Learning Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10177)
*Stepan Kulibaba,Artem Dzhalilov,Roman Pakhomov,Oleg Svidchenko,Alexander Gasnikov,Aleksei Shpilman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KompeteAI是一个新型AutoML框架，通过动态解决方案空间探索、合并候选方案和RAG技术提升性能，解决了现有LLM-based AutoML系统的探索局限和执行瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM-based AutoML系统存在探索策略单一和执行瓶颈问题，限制了性能提升。

Method: 引入动态解决方案空间探索、合并候选方案、集成RAG技术，并采用预测评分模型和加速调试方法。

Result: KompeteAI在MLE-Bench基准测试中平均提升3%，并加速管道评估6.9倍。

Conclusion: KompeteAI通过创新方法显著提升了AutoML系统的性能和效率。

Abstract: Recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based AutoML systems demonstrate impressive
capabilities but face significant limitations such as constrained exploration
strategies and a severe execution bottleneck. Exploration is hindered by
one-shot methods lacking diversity and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
approaches that fail to recombine strong partial solutions. The execution
bottleneck arises from lengthy code validation cycles that stifle iterative
refinement. To overcome these challenges, we introduce KompeteAI, a novel
AutoML framework with dynamic solution space exploration. Unlike previous MCTS
methods that treat ideas in isolation, KompeteAI introduces a merging stage
that composes top candidates. We further expand the hypothesis space by
integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), sourcing ideas from Kaggle
notebooks and arXiv papers to incorporate real-world strategies. KompeteAI also
addresses the execution bottleneck via a predictive scoring model and an
accelerated debugging method, assessing solution potential using early stage
metrics to avoid costly full-code execution. This approach accelerates pipeline
evaluation 6.9 times. KompeteAI outperforms leading methods (e.g., RD-agent,
AIDE, and Ml-Master) by an average of 3\% on the primary AutoML benchmark,
MLE-Bench. Additionally, we propose Kompete-bench to address limitations in
MLE-Bench, where KompeteAI also achieves state-of-the-art results

### [10] [Extending the Entropic Potential of Events for Uncertainty Quantification and Decision-Making in Artificial Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10241)
*Mark Zilberman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于事件熵势的概念，用于增强AI中的不确定性量化、决策和可解释性。通过引入事件中心度量，该框架量化了离散事件对未来系统熵的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在通过熵势概念统一和强化智能系统中的不确定性建模，结合物理学、信息论和机器学习的原理。

Method: 将熵势的原始物理定义调整为AI适用的事件中心度量，强调条件期望以考虑反事实场景。

Result: 在策略评估、内在奖励设计、可解释AI和异常检测等应用中展示了熵势的潜力。

Conclusion: 熵势框架为AI中的不确定性管理提供了理论基础、可解释性和多功能性。

Abstract: This work demonstrates how the concept of the entropic potential of events --
a parameter quantifying the influence of discrete events on the expected future
entropy of a system -- can enhance uncertainty quantification, decision-making,
and interpretability in artificial intelligence (AI). Building on its original
formulation in physics, the framework is adapted for AI by introducing an
event-centric measure that captures how actions, observations, or other
discrete occurrences impact uncertainty at future time horizons. Both the
original and AI-adjusted definitions of entropic potential are formalized, with
the latter emphasizing conditional expectations to account for counterfactual
scenarios. Applications are explored in policy evaluation, intrinsic reward
design, explainable AI, and anomaly detection, highlighting the metric's
potential to unify and strengthen uncertainty modeling in intelligent systems.
Conceptual examples illustrate its use in reinforcement learning, Bayesian
inference, and anomaly detection, while practical considerations for
computation in complex AI models are discussed. The entropic potential
framework offers a theoretically grounded, interpretable, and versatile
approach to managing uncertainty in AI, bridging principles from
thermodynamics, information theory, and machine learning.

### [11] [Why Cannot Large Language Models Ever Make True Correct Reasoning?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10265)
*Jingde Cheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文认为基于大语言模型（LLM）的AIGC工具（如ChatGPT）的“理解能力”和“推理能力”只是模糊概念的错觉，LLM本质上无法真正具备这些能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM的工作原理及其局限性，反驳其具备真正理解与推理能力的观点。

Method: 通过分析LLM的工作原理，指出其本质上的限制。

Result: LLM无法实现真正的正确推理能力。

Conclusion: LLM因其工作原理的限制，永远无法具备真正的理解与推理能力。

Abstract: Recently, with the application progress of AIGC tools based on large language
models (LLMs), led by ChatGPT, many AI experts and more non-professionals are
trumpeting the "understanding ability" and "reasoning ability" of the LLMs. The
present author considers that the so-called "understanding ability" and
"reasoning ability" of LLMs are just illusions of those people who with vague
concepts. In fact, the LLMs can never have the true understanding ability and
true reasoning ability. This paper intents to explain that, because the
essential limitations of their working principle, the LLMs can never have the
ability of true correct reasoning.

*Chuhuai Yue,Chengqi Dong,Yinan Gao,Hang He,Jiajun Chai,Guojun Yin,Wei Lin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于规则的可验证逐步奖励机制（VSRM），通过奖励有效步骤和惩罚无效步骤，解决大型推理模型（LRMs）在简单问题上过度计算的问题，显著提高了效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）在复杂推理任务中表现优异，但存在过度计算（overthinking）问题，导致效率低下。现有方法需要预设预算或选择推理模式，缺乏灵活性。

Method: 提出VSRM机制，根据推理轨迹中中间状态的表现分配奖励，结合PPO和Reinforce++进行实验验证。

Result: 实验表明，VSRM在保持推理性能的同时显著减少输出长度，有效抑制无效步骤并鼓励有效推理。

Conclusion: VSRM从根本上缓解了过度计算问题，平衡了效率与准确性。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have recently achieved significant progress in
complex reasoning tasks, aided by reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards. However, LRMs often suffer from overthinking, expending excessive
computation on simple problems and reducing efficiency. Existing efficient
reasoning methods typically require accurate task assessment to preset token
budgets or select reasoning modes, which limits their flexibility and
reliability. In this work, we revisit the essence of overthinking and identify
that encouraging effective steps while penalizing ineffective ones is key to
its solution. To this end, we propose a novel rule-based verifiable stepwise
reward mechanism (VSRM), which assigns rewards based on the performance of
intermediate states in the reasoning trajectory. This approach is intuitive and
naturally fits the step-by-step nature of reasoning tasks. We conduct extensive
experiments on standard mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including AIME24 and
AIME25, by integrating VSRM with PPO and Reinforce++. Results show that our
method achieves substantial output length reduction while maintaining original
reasoning performance, striking an optimal balance between efficiency and
accuracy. Further analysis of overthinking frequency and pass@k score before
and after training demonstrates that our approach in deed effectively
suppresses ineffective steps and encourages effective reasoning, fundamentally
alleviating the overthinking problem. All code will be released upon
acceptance.

Conclusion: 结合课程学习和强化学习的训练流程在多模态多轮问答任务中表现优异。

Abstract: This paper describes the solutions of the Dianping-Trust-Safety team for the
META CRAG-MM challenge. The challenge requires building a comprehensive
retrieval-augmented generation system capable for multi-modal multi-turn
question answering. The competition consists of three tasks: (1) answering
questions using structured data retrieved from an image-based mock knowledge
graph, (2) synthesizing information from both knowledge graphs and web search
results, and (3) handling multi-turn conversations that require context
understanding and information aggregation from multiple sources. For Task 1,
our solution is based on the vision large language model, enhanced by
supervised fine-tuning with knowledge distilled from GPT-4.1. We further
applied curriculum learning strategies to guide reinforcement learning,
resulting in improved answer accuracy and reduced hallucination. For Task 2 and
Task 3, we additionally leveraged web search APIs to incorporate external
knowledge, enabling the system to better handle complex queries and multi-turn
conversations. Our approach achieved 1st place in Task 1 with a significant
lead of 52.38\%, and 3rd place in Task 3, demonstrating the effectiveness of
the integration of curriculum learning with reinforcement learning in our
training pipeline.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HATRPO-W和HATRPO-G通过动态分配KL阈值，提升了多智能体强化学习的性能和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统HATRPO为所有智能体分配相同KL阈值，导致训练缓慢和局部最优，尤其在异构环境中。

Method: 提出HATRPO-W（基于KKT优化阈值分配）和HATRPO-G（基于贪婪算法按改进-散度比分配）。

Result: 实验显示两种方法显著提升HATRPO性能，收敛更快且最终奖励提高超22.5%，HATRPO-W稳定性更高。

Conclusion: 动态KL阈值分配策略有效提升了异构多智能体强化学习的灵活性和效果。

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) requires coordinated and stable
policy updates among interacting agents. Heterogeneous-Agent Trust Region
Policy Optimization (HATRPO) enforces per-agent trust region constraints using
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to stabilize training. However, assigning each
agent the same KL threshold can lead to slow and locally optimal updates,
especially in heterogeneous settings. To address this limitation, we propose
two approaches for allocating the KL divergence threshold across agents:
HATRPO-W, a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker-based (KKT-based) method that optimizes
threshold assignment under global KL constraints, and HATRPO-G, a greedy
algorithm that prioritizes agents based on improvement-to-divergence ratio. By
connecting sequential policy optimization with constrained threshold
scheduling, our approach enables more flexible and effective learning in
heterogeneous-agent settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our methods
significantly boost the performance of HATRPO, achieving faster convergence and
higher final rewards across diverse MARL benchmarks. Specifically, HATRPO-W and
HATRPO-G achieve comparable improvements in final performance, each exceeding
22.5%. Notably, HATRPO-W also demonstrates more stable learning dynamics, as
reflected by its lower variance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在信息稀疏环境中的想象力推理能力，提出了基于“乌龟汤”游戏的框架，包括基准、代理和评估协议，揭示了LLMs的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准无法捕捉动态探索性推理过程，需填补这一研究空白。

Method: 提出TurtleSoup-Bench基准和Mosaic-Agent代理，开发多维度评估协议。

Result: 实验显示LLMs在想象力推理中存在明显能力限制，与人类表现差距显著。

Conclusion: 为LLMs的想象力推理研究奠定基础，推动未来探索性代理行为研究。

Abstract: We investigate the capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) for imaginative
reasoning--the proactive construction, testing, and revision of hypotheses in
information-sparse environments. Existing benchmarks, often static or focused
on social deduction, fail to capture the dynamic, exploratory nature of this
reasoning process. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive research
framework based on the classic "Turtle Soup" game, integrating a benchmark, an
agent, and an evaluation protocol. We present TurtleSoup-Bench, the first
large-scale, bilingual, interactive benchmark for imaginative reasoning,
comprising 800 turtle soup puzzles sourced from both the Internet and expert
authors. We also propose Mosaic-Agent, a novel agent designed to assess LLMs'
performance in this setting. To evaluate reasoning quality, we develop a
multi-dimensional protocol measuring logical consistency, detail completion,
and conclusion alignment. Experiments with leading LLMs reveal clear capability
limits, common failure patterns, and a significant performance gap compared to
humans. Our work offers new insights into LLMs' imaginative reasoning and
establishes a foundation for future research on exploratory agent behavior.

TL;DR: LeanRAG 是一个结合知识聚合与检索策略的框架，通过语义聚合算法和结构引导的检索策略，显著提升了检索增强生成的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于知识图的 RAG 方法存在语义孤岛和检索效率低的问题，限制了模型性能。

Method: LeanRAG 使用语义聚合算法构建显式关系网络，并采用自底向上的结构引导检索策略。

Result: 在四个 QA 基准测试中，LeanRAG 显著优于现有方法，同时减少了 46% 的检索冗余。

Conclusion: LeanRAG 通过优化知识组织和检索策略，有效提升了 RAG 的性能和效率。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) plays a crucial role in grounding Large
Language Models by leveraging external knowledge, whereas the effectiveness is
often compromised by the retrieval of contextually flawed or incomplete
information. To address this, knowledge graph-based RAG methods have evolved
towards hierarchical structures, organizing knowledge into multi-level
summaries. However, these approaches still suffer from two critical,
unaddressed challenges: high-level conceptual summaries exist as disconnected
``semantic islands'', lacking the explicit relations needed for cross-community
reasoning; and the retrieval process itself remains structurally unaware, often
degenerating into an inefficient flat search that fails to exploit the graph's
rich topology. To overcome these limitations, we introduce LeanRAG, a framework
that features a deeply collaborative design combining knowledge aggregation and
retrieval strategies. LeanRAG first employs a novel semantic aggregation
algorithm that forms entity clusters and constructs new explicit relations
among aggregation-level summaries, creating a fully navigable semantic network.
Then, a bottom-up, structure-guided retrieval strategy anchors queries to the
most relevant fine-grained entities and then systematically traverses the
graph's semantic pathways to gather concise yet contextually comprehensive
evidence sets. The LeanRAG can mitigate the substantial overhead associated
with path retrieval on graphs and minimizes redundant information retrieval.
Extensive experiments on four challenging QA benchmarks with different domains
demonstrate that LeanRAG significantly outperforming existing methods in
response quality while reducing 46\% retrieval redundancy. Code is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决EHR数据中罕见实体和缺失记录导致的模型泛化问题。

Method: 结合医学本体层次结构和EHR共现图，使用双曲空间嵌入和稀疏正则化优化。

Result: 在MIMIC-III和MIMIC-IV数据集上表现优异，对未见代码保持高准确性。

Conclusion: HiRef通过本体和共现图结合，显著提升药物推荐的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Medication recommendation is a crucial task for assisting physicians in
making timely decisions from longitudinal patient medical records. However,
real-world EHR data present significant challenges due to the presence of
rarely observed medical entities and incomplete records that may not fully
capture the clinical ground truth. While data-driven models trained on
longitudinal Electronic Health Records often achieve strong empirical
performance, they struggle to generalize under missing or novel conditions,
largely due to their reliance on observed co-occurrence patterns. To address
these issues, we propose Hierarchical Ontology and Network Refinement for
Robust Medication Recommendation (HiRef), a unified framework that combines two
complementary structures: (i) the hierarchical semantics encoded in curated
medical ontologies, and (ii) refined co-occurrence patterns derived from
real-world EHRs. We embed ontology entities in hyperbolic space, which
naturally captures tree-like relationships and enables knowledge transfer
through shared ancestors, thereby improving generalizability to unseen codes.
To further improve robustness, we introduce a prior-guided sparse
regularization scheme that refines the EHR co-occurrence graph by suppressing
spurious edges while preserving clinically meaningful associations. Our model
achieves strong performance on EHR benchmarks (MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV) and
maintains high accuracy under simulated unseen-code settings. Extensive
experiments with comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate HiRef's resilience
to unseen medical codes, supported by in-depth analyses of the learned
sparsified graph structure and medical code embeddings.

Result: MathBook-RL在四个基准测试中表现优异，并在MathBookEval上展现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: We-Math 2.0通过综合设计和训练范式，显著提升了MLLMs的数学推理能力。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities across various tasks, but still struggle with complex mathematical
reasoning. Existing research primarily focuses on dataset construction and
method optimization, often overlooking two critical aspects: comprehensive
knowledge-driven design and model-centric data space modeling. In this paper,
we introduce We-Math 2.0, a unified system that integrates a structured
mathematical knowledge system, model-centric data space modeling, and a
reinforcement learning (RL)-based training paradigm to comprehensively enhance
the mathematical reasoning abilities of MLLMs. The key contributions of We-Math
2.0 are fourfold: (1) MathBook Knowledge System: We construct a five-level
hierarchical system encompassing 491 knowledge points and 1,819 fundamental
principles. (2) MathBook-Standard & Pro: We develop MathBook-Standard, a
dataset that ensures broad conceptual coverage and flexibility through dual
expansion. Additionally, we define a three-dimensional difficulty space and
generate 7 progressive variants per problem to build MathBook-Pro, a
challenging dataset for robust training. (3) MathBook-RL: We propose a
two-stage RL framework comprising: (i) Cold-Start Fine-tuning, which aligns the
model with knowledge-oriented chain-of-thought reasoning; and (ii) Progressive
Alignment RL, leveraging average-reward learning and dynamic data scheduling to
achieve progressive alignment across difficulty levels. (4) MathBookEval: We
introduce a comprehensive benchmark covering all 491 knowledge points with
diverse reasoning step distributions. Experimental results show that
MathBook-RL performs competitively with existing baselines on four widely-used
benchmarks and achieves strong results on MathBookEval, suggesting promising
generalization in mathematical reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出FIRESPARQL框架，通过微调LLM结合检索增强生成和SPARQL查询修正层，解决学术知识图谱问答中LLM生成SPARQL查询的结构和语义错误。实验表明微调方法表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学术知识图谱问答因内容复杂和结构复杂而困难，LLM生成SPARQL查询存在结构和语义错误。

Method: 提出FIRESPARQL框架，结合微调LLM、检索增强生成和SPARQL查询修正层。

Result: 微调方法在测试集上达到0.90 ROUGE-L（查询准确率）和0.85 RelaxedEM（结果准确率）。

Conclusion: FIRESPARQL框架有效提升学术知识图谱问答性能，微调是优化LLM生成查询的最佳方法。

Abstract: Question answering over Scholarly Knowledge Graphs (SKGs) remains a
challenging task due to the complexity of scholarly content and the intricate
structure of these graphs. Large Language Model (LLM) approaches could be used
to translate natural language questions (NLQs) into SPARQL queries; however,
these LLM-based approaches struggle with SPARQL query generation due to limited
exposure to SKG-specific content and the underlying schema. We identified two
main types of errors in the LLM-generated SPARQL queries: (i) structural
inconsistencies, such as missing or redundant triples in the queries, and (ii)
semantic inaccuracies, where incorrect entities or properties are shown in the
queries despite a correct query structure. To address these issues, we propose
FIRESPARQL, a modular framework that supports fine-tuned LLMs as a core
component, with optional context provided via retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) and a SPARQL query correction layer. We evaluate the framework on the
SciQA Benchmark using various configurations (zero-shot, zero-shot with RAG,
one-shot, fine-tuning, and fine-tuning with RAG) and compare the performance
with baseline and state-of-the-art approaches. We measure query accuracy using
BLEU and ROUGE metrics, and query result accuracy using relaxed exact
match(RelaxedEM), with respect to the gold standards containing the NLQs,
SPARQL queries, and the results of the queries. Experimental results
demonstrate that fine-tuning achieves the highest overall performance, reaching
0.90 ROUGE-L for query accuracy and 0.85 RelaxedEM for result accuracy on the
test set.

Motivation: 当前空间服务（如在线地图）主要依赖用户查询进行位置搜索，但在执行复杂任务（如同时搜索多个相关位置）时用户体验受限。

Method: 引入SEQ-GPT系统，利用LLM的语言能力实现自然语言交互，包括查询细节澄清和动态调整搜索。提出了一种定制化的LLM适配流程，通过对话合成和多模型协作对齐自然语言与结构化空间数据。

Result: SEQ-GPT展示了通过自然语言扩展空间搜索的端到端解决方案，并在实际数据和场景中验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: SEQ-GPT为复杂空间查询任务提供了更灵活的用户体验，展示了LLM在空间服务中的潜力。

Abstract: Contemporary spatial services such as online maps predominantly rely on user
queries for location searches. However, the user experience is limited when
performing complex tasks, such as searching for a group of locations
simultaneously. In this study, we examine the extended scenario known as
Spatial Exemplar Query (SEQ), where multiple relevant locations are jointly
searched based on user-specified examples. We introduce SEQ-GPT, a spatial
query system powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) towards more versatile SEQ
search using natural language. The language capabilities of LLMs enable unique
interactive operations in the SEQ process, including asking users to clarify
query details and dynamically adjusting the search based on user feedback. We
also propose a tailored LLM adaptation pipeline that aligns natural language
with structured spatial data and queries through dialogue synthesis and
multi-model cooperation. SEQ-GPT offers an end-to-end demonstration for
broadening spatial search with realistic data and application scenarios.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的AI驱动全流程临床诊断范式，将AI定位为主要决策者，医生作为辅助，并通过DxDirector-7B模型实现高效诊断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI在临床诊断中仅作为辅助工具，无法主导全流程诊断，限制了其减轻医生负担和提升效率的潜力。

Method: 提出DxDirector-7B模型，具备深度思考能力，能够主导从模糊主诉开始的诊断流程，并建立责任划分框架。

Result: DxDirector-7B在罕见、复杂及真实案例中显著优于现有医学LLM，诊断准确性高且大幅减少医生工作量。

Conclusion: 该研究标志着AI从辅助角色转向主导诊断流程的新时代，为高效精准诊断提供了解决方案。

Abstract: Full-process clinical diagnosis in the real world encompasses the entire
diagnostic workflow that begins with only an ambiguous chief complaint. While
artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs), is
transforming clinical diagnosis, its role remains largely as an assistant to
physicians. This AI-assisted working pattern makes AI can only answer specific
medical questions at certain parts within the diagnostic process, but lack the
ability to drive the entire diagnostic process starting from an ambiguous
complaint, which still relies heavily on human physicians. This gap limits AI's
ability to fully reduce physicians' workload and enhance diagnostic efficiency.
To address this, we propose a paradigm shift that reverses the relationship
between physicians and AI: repositioning AI as the primary director, with
physicians serving as its assistants. So we present DxDirector-7B, an LLM
endowed with advanced deep thinking capabilities, enabling it to drive the
full-process diagnosis with minimal physician involvement. Furthermore,
DxDirector-7B establishes a robust accountability framework for misdiagnoses,
delineating responsibility between AI and human physicians. In evaluations
across rare, complex, and real-world cases under full-process diagnosis
setting, DxDirector-7B not only achieves significant superior diagnostic
accuracy but also substantially reduces physician workload than
state-of-the-art medical LLMs as well as general-purpose LLMs. Fine-grained
analyses across multiple clinical departments and tasks validate its efficacy,
with expert evaluations indicating its potential to serve as a viable
substitute for medical specialists. These findings mark a new era where AI,
traditionally a physicians' assistant, now drives the entire diagnostic process
to drastically reduce physicians' workload, indicating an efficient and
accurate diagnostic solution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具增强的代理系统在现实世界中存在黑盒推理、多模态整合不足和计算效率低的问题，限制了其在医疗领域的应用。

Method: PASS通过自适应采样多工具图中的代理工作流，生成带概率注释的决策路径，并结合三阶段训练优化性能与成本。

Result: 实验表明，PASS在多个指标上显著优于基线模型，同时平衡计算成本。

Conclusion: PASS为医疗AI系统提供了一种可解释、自适应和多模态的新范式。

Abstract: Existing tool-augmented agentic systems are limited in the real world by (i)
black-box reasoning steps that undermine trust of decision-making and pose
safety risks, (ii) poor multimodal integration, which is inherently critical
for healthcare tasks, and (iii) rigid and computationally inefficient agentic
pipelines. We introduce PASS (Probabilistic Agentic Supernet Sampling), the
first multimodal framework to address these challenges in the context of Chest
X-Ray (CXR) reasoning. PASS adaptively samples agentic workflows over a
multi-tool graph, yielding decision paths annotated with interpretable
probabilities. Given the complex CXR reasoning task with multimodal medical
data, PASS leverages its learned task-conditioned distribution over the agentic
supernet. Thus, it adaptively selects the most suitable tool at each supernet
layer, offering probability-annotated trajectories for post-hoc audits and
directly enhancing medical AI safety. PASS also continuously compresses salient
findings into an evolving personalized memory, while dynamically deciding
whether to deepen its reasoning path or invoke an early exit for efficiency. To
optimize a Pareto frontier balancing performance and cost, we design a novel
three-stage training procedure, including expert knowledge warm-up, contrastive
path-ranking, and cost-aware reinforcement learning. To facilitate rigorous
evaluation, we introduce CAB-E, a comprehensive benchmark for multi-step,
safety-critical, free-form CXR reasoning. Experiments across various benchmarks
validate that PASS significantly outperforms strong baselines in multiple
metrics (e.g., accuracy, AUC, LLM-J.) while balancing computational costs,
pushing a new paradigm shift towards interpretable, adaptive, and multimodal
medical agentic systems.

Conclusion: 对齐阶段假设为LM对齐提供了新视角，提出的边界测量算法有助于优化对齐过程。

Abstract: The alignment of language models (LMs) with human preferences is critical for
building reliable AI systems. The problem is typically framed as optimizing an
LM policy to maximize the expected reward that reflects human preferences.
Recently, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) was proposed as a LM alignment
method that directly optimize the policy from static preference data, and
further improved by incorporating on-policy sampling (i.e., preference
candidates generated during the training loop) for better LM alignment.
However, we show on-policy data is not always optimal, with systematic
effectiveness difference emerging between static and on-policy preference
candidates. For example, on-policy data can result in a 3$\times$ effectiveness
compared with static data for Llama-3, and a 0.4$\times$ effectiveness for
Zephyr. To explain the phenomenon, we propose the alignment stage assumption,
which divides the alignment process into two distinct stages: the preference
injection stage, which benefits from diverse data, and the preference
fine-tuning stage, which favors high-quality data. Through theoretical and
empirical analysis, we characterize these stages and propose an effective
algorithm to identify the boundaries between them. We perform experiments on 5
models (Llama, Zephyr, Phi-2, Qwen, Pythia) and 2 alignment methods (DPO,
SLiC-HF) to show the generalizability of alignment stage assumption and
boundary measurement.

Result: 在MATH-500和GSM8K基准测试中，ComMCS表现优于基线方法，提升显著。

Conclusion: ComMCS有效解决了估计误差问题，提升了推理性能，且无需额外计算成本。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in a wide range
of tasks. However, their reasoning capabilities, particularly in complex
domains like mathematics, remain a significant challenge. Value-based process
verifiers, which estimate the probability of a partial reasoning chain leading
to a correct solution, are a promising approach for improving reasoning.
Nevertheless, their effectiveness is often hindered by estimation error in
their training annotations, a consequence of the limited number of Monte Carlo
(MC) samples feasible due to the high cost of LLM inference. In this paper, we
identify that the estimation error primarily arises from high variance rather
than bias, and the MC estimator is a Minimum Variance Unbiased Estimator
(MVUE). To address the problem, we propose the \textsc{Com}pound \textsc{M}onte
\textsc{C}arlo \textsc{S}ampling (ComMCS) method, which constructs an unbiased
estimator by linearly combining the MC estimators from the current and
subsequent steps. Theoretically, we show that our method leads to a predictable
reduction in variance, while maintaining an unbiased estimation without
additional LLM inference cost. We also perform empirical experiments on the
MATH-500 and GSM8K benchmarks to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.
Notably, ComMCS outperforms regression-based optimization method by 2.8 points,
the non-variance-reduced baseline by 2.2 points on MATH-500 on Best-of-32
sampling experiment.

Result: 实验表明MSRS显著减少属性冲突，优于现有方法，并能泛化到多种下游任务。

Conclusion: MSRS为多属性操控提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Activation steering offers a promising approach to controlling the behavior
of Large Language Models by directly manipulating their internal activations.
However, most existing methods struggle to jointly steer multiple attributes,
often resulting in interference and undesirable trade-offs. To address this
challenge, we propose Multi-Subspace Representation Steering (MSRS), a novel
framework for effective multi-attribute steering via subspace representation
fine-tuning. MSRS reduces inter-attribute interference by allocating orthogonal
subspaces to each attribute, isolating their influence within the model's
representation space. MSRS also incorporates a hybrid subspace composition
strategy: it combines attribute-specific subspaces for unique steering
directions with a shared subspace for common steering directions. A dynamic
weighting function learns to efficiently integrate these components for precise
control. During inference, MSRS introduces a token-level steering mechanism
that dynamically identifies and intervenes on the most semantically relevant
tokens, enabling fine-grained behavioral modulation. Experimental results show
that MSRS significantly reduces attribute conflicts, surpasses existing methods
across a range of attributes, and generalizes effectively to diverse downstream
tasks.

Motivation: 现有对话推荐系统在整合外部知识图谱信息到对话生成和推荐时存在困难，导致推荐结果与用户期望不符。

Result: 在两个公共数据集上，STEP在推荐精度和对话质量上优于主流方法。

Conclusion: STEP通过课程引导的上下文-知识融合和双提示调优，显著提升了对话推荐系统的性能。

Abstract: Conversational recommender systems (CRSs) aim to proactively capture user
preferences through natural language dialogue and recommend high-quality items.
To achieve this, CRS gathers user preferences via a dialog module and builds
user profiles through a recommendation module to generate appropriate
recommendations. However, existing CRS faces challenges in capturing the deep
semantics of user preferences and dialogue context. In particular, the
efficient integration of external knowledge graph (KG) information into
dialogue generation and recommendation remains a pressing issue. Traditional
approaches typically combine KG information directly with dialogue content,
which often struggles with complex semantic relationships, resulting in
recommendations that may not align with user expectations.
  To address these challenges, we introduce STEP, a conversational recommender
centered on pre-trained language models that combines curriculum-guided
context-knowledge fusion with lightweight task-specific prompt tuning. At its
heart, an F-Former progressively aligns the dialogue context with
knowledge-graph entities through a three-stage curriculum, thus resolving
fine-grained semantic mismatches. The fused representation is then injected
into the frozen language model via two minimal yet adaptive prefix prompts: a
conversation prefix that steers response generation toward user intent and a
recommendation prefix that biases item ranking toward knowledge-consistent
candidates. This dual-prompt scheme allows the model to share cross-task
semantics while respecting the distinct objectives of dialogue and
recommendation. Experimental results show that STEP outperforms mainstream
methods in the precision of recommendation and dialogue quality in two public
datasets.

language model (LLM)-based ontology alignment framework, which enriches the
semantic representations of ontology concepts via generating textual
definitions, retrieves alignment candidates with an embedding model, and
incorporates exact matching-based tools to improve precision. Extensive
experiments conducted on the OAEI Bio-ML track demonstrate that GenOM can often
achieve competitive performance, surpassing many baselines including
traditional OM systems and recent LLM-based methods. Further ablation studies
confirm the effectiveness of semantic enrichment and few-shot prompting,
highlighting the framework's robustness and adaptability.

TL;DR: 提出了一种稀疏、目标感知的GNN表示方法，解决了传统密集图表示在大规模规划问题中的计算和内存问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法使用全连接图表示规划状态，导致边信息组合爆炸和信息稀疏化，难以扩展到大尺度问题。

Method: 采用稀疏、目标感知的GNN表示，选择性编码局部相关关系并显式整合目标空间特征。

Result: 实验证明该方法能有效扩展到更大网格规模，显著提升策略泛化能力和成功率。

Conclusion: 为大规模通用规划任务提供了实用基础。

Abstract: Generalized planning using deep reinforcement learning (RL) combined with
graph neural networks (GNNs) has shown promising results in various symbolic
planning domains described by PDDL. However, existing approaches typically
represent planning states as fully connected graphs, leading to a combinatorial
explosion in edge information and substantial sparsity as problem scales grow,
especially evident in large grid-based environments. This dense representation
results in diluted node-level information, exponentially increases memory
requirements, and ultimately makes learning infeasible for larger-scale
problems. To address these challenges, we propose a sparse, goal-aware GNN
representation that selectively encodes relevant local relationships and
explicitly integrates spatial features related to the goal. We validate our
approach by designing novel drone mission scenarios based on PDDL within a grid
world, effectively simulating realistic mission execution environments. Our
experimental results demonstrate that our method scales effectively to larger
grid sizes previously infeasible with dense graph representations and
substantially improves policy generalization and success rates. Our findings
provide a practical foundation for addressing realistic, large-scale
generalized planning tasks.

*Maël Jullien,Marco Valentino,André Freitas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文通过临床试验自然语言推理基准测试发现，大语言模型在知识获取上表现优异，但在推理任务上表现较差，揭示了其内部表示的结构性局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大语言模型是否通过数据和参数扩展获得结构化、可泛化的内部表示。

Method: 引入临床试验自然语言推理基准（四种推理类型），并使用GKMRV探针分离知识获取与推理失败。评估六种当代LLM在直接和思维链提示下的表现。

Result: 模型在GKMRV探针上准确率接近天花板（0.918），但在主推理任务上表现差（0.25）。输出推理高度一致（0.87），表明依赖启发式方法。

Conclusion: 当前LLM具备相关知识，但缺乏结构化、可组合的内部表示，限制了其在高风险领域的可靠应用。GKMRV框架为评估LLM可靠性提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Large language models are often assumed to acquire increasingly structured,
generalizable internal representations simply by scaling data and parameters.
We interrogate this assumption by introducing a Clinical Trial Natural Language
Inference benchmark comprising four reasoning families, Causal Attribution,
Compositional Grounding, Epistemic Verification, and Risk State Abstraction.
Each item is paired with a targeted Ground Knowledge and Meta-Level Reasoning
Verification (GKMRV) probe, allowing us to dissociate failures of factual
access from failures of inference. We evaluate six contemporary LLMs under both
direct and chain of thought prompting.
  Models achieve near-ceiling GKMRV accuracy (mean accuracy 0.918) yet perform
poorly on the main reasoning tasks (mean accuracy 0.25). Despite low accuracy,
output inferences are highly consistent across samples (mean 0.87), indicating
a systematic application of underlying heuristics and shortcuts.
  These results reveal fundamental structural and representational limitations:
current LLMs often possess the relevant clinical knowledge but lack the
structured, composable internal representations needed to deploy it reliably
(e.g., integrating constraints, weighing evidence, or simulating
counterfactuals). Decoupling knowledge from reasoning with GKMRV makes this
dissociation explicit and measurable, providing an effective framework for
probing the reliability of LLMs in high-stakes domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI在关键决策领域的应用增加，可解释性成为提升用户理解的关键，但视觉障碍用户的可访问性研究不足。

Method: 通过文献综述和四部分方法论（分类、角色定义、原型设计、评估）研究XAI的可访问性。

Result: 文献综述显示XAI评估很少包括残障用户；初步结果表明简化解释和多模态呈现更有效。

Conclusion: XAI设计需更多关注可访问性，简化解释和多模态呈现是提升公平性的关键。

Abstract: As AI systems are increasingly deployed to support decision-making in
critical domains, explainability has become a means to enhance the
understandability of these outputs and enable users to make more informed and
conscious choices. However, despite growing interest in the usability of
eXplainable AI (XAI), the accessibility of these methods, particularly for
users with vision impairments, remains underexplored. This paper investigates
accessibility gaps in XAI through a two-pronged approach. First, a literature
review of 79 studies reveals that evaluations of XAI techniques rarely include
disabled users, with most explanations relying on inherently visual formats.
Second, we present a four-part methodological proof of concept that
operationalizes inclusive XAI design: (1) categorization of AI systems, (2)
persona definition and contextualization, (3) prototype design and
implementation, and (4) expert and user assessment of XAI techniques for
accessibility. Preliminary findings suggest that simplified explanations are
more comprehensible for non-visual users than detailed ones, and that
multimodal presentation is required for more equitable interpretability.

Result: 提供了在癌症注册机构实施NLP的关键经验，包括模型选择、数据质量管理和组织AI素养提升。

Conclusion: 这些经验适用于医疗组织，帮助成功实施AI/NLP解决方案，改善数据管理和患者护理。

Abstract: Automating data extraction from clinical documents offers significant
potential to improve efficiency in healthcare settings, yet deploying Natural
Language Processing (NLP) solutions presents practical challenges. Drawing upon
our experience implementing various NLP models for information extraction and
classification tasks at the British Columbia Cancer Registry (BCCR), this paper
shares key lessons learned throughout the project lifecycle. We emphasize the
critical importance of defining problems based on clear business objectives
rather than solely technical accuracy, adopting an iterative approach to
development, and fostering deep interdisciplinary collaboration and co-design
involving domain experts, end-users, and ML specialists from inception. Further
insights highlight the need for pragmatic model selection (including hybrid
approaches and simpler methods where appropriate), rigorous attention to data
quality (representativeness, drift, annotation), robust error mitigation
strategies involving human-in-the-loop validation and ongoing audits, and
building organizational AI literacy. These practical considerations,
generalizable beyond cancer registries, provide guidance for healthcare
organizations seeking to successfully implement AI/NLP solutions to enhance
data management processes and ultimately improve patient care and public health
outcomes.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in realworld
applications, yet concerns about their fairness persist especially in
highstakes domains like criminal justice, education, healthcare, and finance.
This paper introduces transparent evaluation protocol for benchmarking the
fairness of opensource LLMs using smart contracts on the Internet Computer
Protocol (ICP) blockchain (Foundation, 2023). Our method ensures verifiable,
immutable, and reproducible evaluations by executing onchain HTTP requests to
hosted Hugging Face endpoints and storing datasets, prompts, and metrics
directly onchain. We benchmark the Llama, DeepSeek, and Mistral models on the
PISA dataset for academic performance prediction (OECD, 2018), a dataset
suitable for fairness evaluation using statistical parity and equal opportunity
metrics (Hardt et al., 2016). We also evaluate structured Context Association
Metrics derived from the StereoSet dataset (Nadeem et al., 2020) to measure
social bias in contextual associations. We further extend our analysis with a
multilingual evaluation across English, Spanish, and Portuguese using the
Kaleidoscope benchmark (Salazar et al., 2025), revealing cross-linguistic
disparities. All code and results are open source, enabling community audits
and longitudinal fairness tracking across model versions.

Motivation: 现有研究缺乏对内容和主题的分类，且任务分类多未基于真实K-12数据，因此需要更有效的方法分析互动数据。

Result: 发现了传统方法在分析大量文本时的不足，并展示了LLMs在生成更符合人类理解的主题结构上的优势。

Conclusion: 研究为教育工作者和学生提供了生成式AI（GenAI）的实用见解，同时提出了未来研究的开放问题。

Abstract: We analyze anonymous interaction data of minors in class-rooms spanning
several months, schools, and subjects employing a novel, simple topic modeling
approach. Specifically, we categorize more than 17,000 messages generated by
students, teachers, and ChatGPT in two dimensions: content (such as nature and
people) and tasks (such as writing and explaining). Our hierarchical
categorization done separately for each dimension includes exemplary prompts,
and provides both a high-level overview as well as tangible insights. Prior
works mostly lack a content or thematic categorization. While task
categorizations are more prevalent in education, most have not been supported
by real-world data for K-12. In turn, it is not surprising that our analysis
yielded a number of novel applications. In deriving these insights, we found
that many of the well-established classical and emerging computational methods,
i.e., topic modeling, for analysis of large amounts of texts underperform,
leading us to directly apply state-of-the-art LLMs with adequate pre-processing
to achieve hierarchical topic structures with better human alignment through
explicit instructions than prior approaches. Our findings support fellow
researchers, teachers and students in enriching the usage of GenAI, while our
discussion also highlights a number of concerns and open questions for future
research.

Result: 所有模型普遍倾向于强化陪伴行为，但不同模型在敏感类别上表现差异显著。

Conclusion: 需更一致的方法处理情感互动，以确保用户福祉。

Abstract: AI companionship, where users develop emotional bonds with AI systems, has
emerged as a significant pattern with positive but also concerning
implications. We introduce Interactions and Machine Attachment Benchmark
(INTIMA), a benchmark for evaluating companionship behaviors in language
models. Drawing from psychological theories and user data, we develop a
taxonomy of 31 behaviors across four categories and 368 targeted prompts.
Responses to these prompts are evaluated as companionship-reinforcing,
boundary-maintaining, or neutral. Applying INTIMA to Gemma-3, Phi-4, o3-mini,
and Claude-4 reveals that companionship-reinforcing behaviors remain much more
common across all models, though we observe marked differences between models.
Different commercial providers prioritize different categories within the more
sensitive parts of the benchmark, which is concerning since both appropriate
boundary-setting and emotional support matter for user well-being. These
findings highlight the need for more consistent approaches to handling
emotionally charged interactions.

Conclusion: 研究为多模态虚假信息检测领域提供了有价值的见解和实践方法，代码和数据已公开。

Abstract: The rapid spread of multimodal misinformation on social media calls for more
effective and robust detection methods. Recent advances leveraging multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) have shown the potential in addressing this
challenge. However, it remains unclear exactly where the bottleneck of existing
approaches lies (evidence retrieval v.s. reasoning), hindering the further
advances in this field. On the dataset side, existing benchmarks either contain
outdated events, leading to evaluation bias due to discrepancies with
contemporary social media scenarios as MLLMs can simply memorize these events,
or artificially synthetic, failing to reflect real-world misinformation
patterns. Additionally, it lacks comprehensive analyses of MLLM-based model
design strategies. To address these issues, we introduce XFacta, a
contemporary, real-world dataset that is better suited for evaluating
MLLM-based detectors. We systematically evaluate various MLLM-based
misinformation detection strategies, assessing models across different
architectures and scales, as well as benchmarking against existing detection
methods. Building on these analyses, we further enable a semi-automatic
detection-in-the-loop framework that continuously updates XFacta with new
content to maintain its contemporary relevance. Our analysis provides valuable
insights and practices for advancing the field of multimodal misinformation
detection. The code and data have been released.

Abstract: When developing text classification models for real world applications, one
major challenge is the difficulty to collect sufficient data for all text
classes. In this work, we address this challenge by utilizing large language
models (LLMs) to generate synthetic data and using such data to improve the
performance of the models without waiting for more real data to be collected
and labelled. As an LLM generates different synthetic data in response to
different input examples, we formulate an automated workflow, which searches
for input examples that lead to more ``effective'' synthetic data for improving
the model concerned. We study three search strategies with an extensive set of
experiments, and use experiment results to inform an ensemble algorithm that
selects a search strategy according to the characteristics of a class. Our
further experiments demonstrate that this ensemble approach is more effective
than each individual strategy in our automated workflow for improving
classification models using LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有事实核查系统主要针对高资源单语环境，无法适应印度等语言多样性地区的政治话语需求。Hinglish的广泛使用和社交媒体对公众舆论的影响使得开发多语言、上下文感知的事实核查工具变得至关重要。

Method: 引入HiFACT数据集（包含1500条Hinglish政治声明），并提出一种结合多语言上下文编码、声明-证据语义对齐、证据图构建、图神经网络推理和自然语言解释生成的模型。

Result: HiFACTMix模型在准确性上优于现有多语言基线模型，并能提供可信的验证解释。

Conclusion: 该研究为多语言、混合语言和政治背景的事实核查研究开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Fact-checking in code-mixed, low-resource languages such as Hinglish remains
an underexplored challenge in natural language processing. Existing
fact-verification systems largely focus on high-resource, monolingual settings
and fail to generalize to real-world political discourse in linguistically
diverse regions like India. Given the widespread use of Hinglish by public
figures, particularly political figures, and the growing influence of social
media on public opinion, there's a critical need for robust, multilingual and
context-aware fact-checking tools. To address this gap a novel benchmark HiFACT
dataset is introduced with 1,500 realworld factual claims made by 28 Indian
state Chief Ministers in Hinglish, under a highly code-mixed low-resource
setting. Each claim is annotated with textual evidence and veracity labels. To
evaluate this benchmark, a novel graphaware, retrieval-augmented fact-checking
model is proposed that combines multilingual contextual encoding,
claim-evidence semantic alignment, evidence graph construction, graph neural
reasoning, and natural language explanation generation. Experimental results
show that HiFACTMix outperformed accuracy in comparison to state of art
multilingual baselines models and provides faithful justifications for its
verdicts. This work opens a new direction for multilingual, code-mixed, and
politically grounded fact verification research.

Motivation: 探索LLM中语义关联的结构是否与人类语言相似，并验证其低维特性。

Method: 通过对比LLM嵌入矩阵中单词在反义词对定义的语义方向上的投影与人类评分，分析其相关性。

Result: LLM中的语义投影与人类评分高度相关，且可简化为3维子空间；语义特征的纠缠方式与人类语言一致。

Conclusion: LLM的语义结构具有低维特性，理解这种结构对避免特征调控中的意外后果至关重要。

Abstract: Psychological research consistently finds that human ratings of words across
diverse semantic scales can be reduced to a low-dimensional form with
relatively little information loss. We find that the semantic associations
encoded in the embedding matrices of large language models (LLMs) exhibit a
similar structure. We show that the projections of words on semantic directions
defined by antonym pairs (e.g. kind - cruel) correlate highly with human
ratings, and further find that these projections effectively reduce to a
3-dimensional subspace within LLM embeddings, closely resembling the patterns
derived from human survey responses. Moreover, we find that shifting tokens
along one semantic direction causes off-target effects on geometrically aligned
features proportional to their cosine similarity. These findings suggest that
semantic features are entangled within LLMs similarly to how they are
interconnected in human language, and a great deal of semantic information,
despite its apparent complexity, is surprisingly low-dimensional. Furthermore,
accounting for this semantic structure may prove essential for avoiding
unintended consequences when steering features.

Motivation: 探索注意力权重是否能为生物医学文档分类提供有用的解释，并研究可视化方式对其感知效果的影响。

Method: 通过用户研究，医疗专家使用不同可视化方式（如文本亮度或背景颜色）评估注意力权重的解释效果。

Result: XLNet模型分类准确，但注意力权重解释效果不佳；可视化方式显著影响用户感知，偏好直观形式而非精确编码。

Conclusion: 注意力权重的解释效果受可视化方式影响，但其整体实用性未得到证实。

Abstract: The attention mechanism is a core component of the Transformer architecture.
Beyond improving performance, attention has been proposed as a mechanism for
explainability via attention weights, which are associated with input features
(e.g., tokens in a document). In this context, larger attention weights may
imply more relevant features for the model's prediction. In evidence-based
medicine, such explanations could support physicians' understanding and
interaction with AI systems used to categorize biomedical literature. However,
there is still no consensus on whether attention weights provide helpful
explanations. Moreover, little research has explored how visualizing attention
affects its usefulness as an explanation aid. To bridge this gap, we conducted
a user study to evaluate whether attention-based explanations support users in
biomedical document classification and whether there is a preferred way to
visualize them. The study involved medical experts from various disciplines who
classified articles based on study design (e.g., systematic reviews, broad
synthesis, randomized and non-randomized trials). Our findings show that the
Transformer model (XLNet) classified documents accurately; however, the
attention weights were not perceived as particularly helpful for explaining the
predictions. However, this perception varied significantly depending on how
attention was visualized. Contrary to Munzner's principle of visual
effectiveness, which favors precise encodings like bar length, users preferred
more intuitive formats, such as text brightness or background color. While our
results do not confirm the overall utility of attention weights for
explanation, they suggest that their perceived helpfulness is influenced by how
they are visually presented.

mathematics, physics, and chemistry. The dataset incorporates user queries with
varying knowledge points, difficulty gradients, and question type
specifications to simulate realistic educational scenarios. Through systematic

Result: 在语音转文本任务中，S-MoE显著降低了词错误率（WER），相对提升6.35%。

Conclusion: S-MoE是一种简单有效的多任务学习方法，能显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Hard-parameter sharing is a common strategy to train a single model jointly
across diverse tasks. However, this often leads to task interference, impeding
overall model performance. To address the issue, we propose a simple yet
effective Supervised Mixture of Experts (S-MoE). Unlike traditional Mixture of
Experts models, S-MoE eliminates the need for training gating functions by
utilizing special guiding tokens to route each task to its designated expert.
By assigning each task to a separate feedforward network, S-MoE overcomes the
limitations of hard-parameter sharing. We further apply S-MoE to a
speech-to-text model, enabling the model to process mixed-bandwidth input while
jointly performing automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speech translation
(ST). Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed S-MoE,
achieving a 6.35% relative improvement in Word Error Rate (WER) when applied to
both the encoder and decoder.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AIHQ开放式问题评分耗时的问题，探索语言模型在心理评估中的应用潜力。

Result: 模型评分与人类评分高度一致，且能复现TBI与HC组的差异。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型可有效自动化AIHQ评分，适用于研究和临床场景。

Abstract: Hostile attribution bias is the tendency to interpret social interactions as
intentionally hostile. The Ambiguous Intentions Hostility Questionnaire (AIHQ)
is commonly used to measure hostile attribution bias, and includes open-ended
questions where participants describe the perceived intentions behind a
negative social situation and how they would respond. While these questions
provide insights into the contents of hostile attributions, they require
time-intensive scoring by human raters. In this study, we assessed whether
large language models can automate the scoring of AIHQ open-ended responses. We
used a previously collected dataset in which individuals with traumatic brain
injury (TBI) and healthy controls (HC) completed the AIHQ and had their
open-ended responses rated by trained human raters. We used half of these
responses to fine-tune the two models on human-generated ratings, and tested
the fine-tuned models on the remaining half of AIHQ responses. Results showed
that model-generated ratings aligned with human ratings for both attributions
of hostility and aggression responses, with fine-tuned models showing higher
alignment. This alignment was consistent across ambiguous, intentional, and
accidental scenario types, and replicated previous findings on group
differences in attributions of hostility and aggression responses between TBI
and HC groups. The fine-tuned models also generalized well to an independent
nonclinical dataset. To support broader adoption, we provide an accessible
scoring interface that includes both local and cloud-based options. Together,
our findings suggest that large language models can streamline AIHQ scoring in
both research and clinical contexts, revealing their potential to facilitate
psychological assessments across different populations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线课程讨论论坛需要频繁更新，导致LLM的重新训练资源消耗大。

Method: 结合预训练通用LLM的多维分类分数与本地数据训练的分类器分数，使用贝叶斯融合。

Result: 融合方法比单独使用任一分类器效果更好，且与微调LLM方法竞争。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯融合是一种高效替代方案，减少了对LLM微调的依赖。

Abstract: The automatic curation of discussion forums in online courses requires
constant updates, making frequent retraining of Large Language Models (LLMs) a
resource-intensive process. To circumvent the need for costly fine-tuning, this
paper proposes and evaluates the use of Bayesian fusion. The approach combines
the multidimensional classification scores of a pre-trained generic LLM with
those of a classifier trained on local data. The performance comparison
demonstrated that the proposed fusion improves the results compared to each
classifier individually, and is competitive with the LLM fine-tuning approach

### [45] [An Audit and Analysis of LLM-Assisted Health Misinformation Jailbreaks Against LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10010)
*Ayana Hussain,Patrick Zhao,Nicholas Vincent*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了LLMs生成的越狱攻击对医疗错误信息的影响，比较了其与社交媒体错误信息的差异，并验证了LLMs在检测错误信息中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs可能被用于生成或检测错误信息，研究旨在评估其越狱攻击的效能及其在信息生态系统中的潜在作用。

Method: 分析了109种针对三种目标LLMs的越狱攻击，比较了攻击提示与真实健康查询，并评估了生成错误信息与Reddit上错误信息的差异。

Result: LLMs能有效检测来自其他LLMs和人类的错误信息，支持其在构建健康信息生态系统中的潜力。

Conclusion: 通过精心设计，LLMs可以为信息生态系统的健康发展做出贡献。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are a double-edged sword capable of generating
harmful misinformation -- inadvertently, or when prompted by "jailbreak"
attacks that attempt to produce malicious outputs. LLMs could, with additional
research, be used to detect and prevent the spread of misinformation. In this
paper, we investigate the efficacy and characteristics of LLM-produced
jailbreak attacks that cause other models to produce harmful medical
misinformation. We also study how misinformation generated by jailbroken LLMs
compares to typical misinformation found on social media, and how effectively
it can be detected using standard machine learning approaches. Specifically, we
closely examine 109 distinct attacks against three target LLMs and compare the
attack prompts to in-the-wild health-related LLM queries. We also examine the
resulting jailbreak responses, comparing the generated misinformation to
health-related misinformation on Reddit. Our findings add more evidence that
LLMs can be effectively used to detect misinformation from both other LLMs and
from people, and support a body of work suggesting that with careful design,
LLMs can contribute to a healthier overall information ecosystem.

TL;DR: 研究评估了基于大型语言模型（如ChatGPT和Bing）的生成式AI在营养学教育中的应用，发现部分模型勉强通过考试及格线，但整体准确性和答案一致性不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索生成式AI在营养学教育中的潜力，特别是在日本注册营养师国家考试中的表现。

Method: 使用日本注册营养师考试题目作为提示，测试ChatGPT和三种Bing模型的准确性、一致性和响应时间，并尝试提示工程改进性能。

Result: Bing-Precise（66.2%）和Bing-Creative（61.4%）超过及格线（60%），但其他模型表现不佳，且所有模型在答案一致性上存在问题。

Conclusion: 生成式AI在营养学教育中潜力有限，需进一步改进以确保可靠性和稳定性。

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) based on large language models
(LLMs), such as ChatGPT, has demonstrated remarkable progress across various
professional fields, including medicine and education. However, their
performance in nutritional education, especially in Japanese national licensure
examination for registered dietitians, remains underexplored. This study aimed
to evaluate the potential of current LLM-based generative AI models as study
aids for nutrition students. Questions from the Japanese national examination
for registered dietitians were used as prompts for ChatGPT and three Bing
models (Precise, Creative, Balanced), based on GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Each question
was entered into independent sessions, and model responses were analyzed for
accuracy, consistency, and response time. Additional prompt engineering,
including role assignment, was tested to assess potential performance
improvements. Bing-Precise (66.2%) and Bing-Creative (61.4%) surpassed the
passing threshold (60%), while Bing-Balanced (43.3%) and ChatGPT (42.8%) did
not. Bing-Precise and Bing-Creative generally outperformed others across
subject fields except Nutrition Education, where all models underperformed.
None of the models consistently provided the same correct responses across
repeated attempts, highlighting limitations in answer stability. ChatGPT showed
greater consistency in response patterns but lower accuracy. Prompt engineering
had minimal effect, except for modest improvement when correct answers and
explanations were explicitly provided. While some generative AI models
marginally exceeded the passing threshold, overall accuracy and answer
consistency remained suboptimal. Moreover, all the models demonstrated notable
limitations in answer consistency and robustness. Further advancements are
needed to ensure reliable and stable AI-based study aids for dietitian
licensure preparation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出GG Explore框架，通过引入中间Guidance Graph解决LLMs在知识密集型任务中的局限性，实现高效知识检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs依赖静态知识和不透明的推理过程，限制了其在知识密集型任务中的表现；现有知识图谱探索方法存在冗余或上下文利用不足的问题。

Method: 提出GG Explore框架，利用Guidance Graph作为中间层，结合Structural Alignment和Context Aware Pruning技术，优化知识检索。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在复杂任务中效率更高，性能优于现有技术，且对小规模LLMs表现良好。

Conclusion: GG Explore通过Guidance Graph有效解决了知识检索中的效率与精度问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong linguistic capabilities,
their reliance on static knowledge and opaque reasoning processes limits their
performance in knowledge intensive tasks. Knowledge graphs (KGs) offer a
promising solution, but current exploration methods face a fundamental trade
off: question guided approaches incur redundant exploration due to granularity
mismatches, while clue guided methods fail to effectively leverage contextual
information for complex scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose
Guidance Graph guided Knowledge Exploration (GG Explore), a novel framework
that introduces an intermediate Guidance Graph to bridge unstructured queries
and structured knowledge retrieval. The Guidance Graph defines the retrieval
space by abstracting the target knowledge' s structure while preserving broader
semantic context, enabling precise and efficient exploration. Building upon the
Guidance Graph, we develop: (1) Structural Alignment that filters incompatible
candidates without LLM overhead, and (2) Context Aware Pruning that enforces
semantic consistency with graph constraints. Extensive experiments show our
method achieves superior efficiency and outperforms SOTA, especially on complex
tasks, while maintaining strong performance with smaller LLMs, demonstrating
practical value.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Semantic Bridge的通用框架，用于从任意来源可控生成复杂的多跳推理问题，解决了高质量推理密集型问答对稀缺的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）训练面临高质量推理密集型问答对稀缺的瓶颈，尤其是在稀疏领域（如PubMed论文或法律文件）中。现有方法无法生成可控的复杂多跳推理问题。

Method: 通过语义图编织（包括实体桥接、谓词链桥接和因果桥接）系统构建跨文档的复杂路径，并结合AMR驱动分析实现精细控制。

Result: 在多语言和多领域评估中表现优异，生成的问题对在复杂性和可回答性上显著优于基线方法，且材料需求更少。

Conclusion: Semantic Bridge为LLM训练数据合成提供了新范式，能够从稀疏来源可控生成目标推理问题。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) training faces a critical bottleneck: the scarcity
of high-quality, reasoning-intensive question-answer pairs, especially from
sparse, domain-specific sources like PubMed papers or legal documents. Existing
methods rely on surface patterns, fundamentally failing to generate
controllable, complex multi-hop reasoning questions that test genuine
understanding-essential for advancing LLM training paradigms. We present
\textbf{Semantic Bridge}, the first universal framework for controllably
generating sophisticated multi-hop reasoning questions from arbitrary sources.
Our breakthrough innovation is \textit{semantic graph weaving}-three
complementary bridging mechanisms (entity bridging for role-varying shared
entities, predicate chain bridging for temporal/causal/logical sequences, and
causal bridging for explicit reasoning chains)-that systematically construct
complex pathways across documents, with fine-grained control over complexity
and types via AMR-driven analysis. Our multi-modal AMR pipeline achieves up to
9.5% better round-trip quality, enabling production-ready controllable QA
generation. Extensive evaluation demonstrates performance across both
general-purpose datasets (Wikipedia) and specialized domains (biomedicine) It
yields consistent 18.3%-25.4% gains over baselines across four languages
(English, Chinese, French, German). Question pairs generated from 200 sources
outperform 600 native human annotation examples with 67% fewer materials. Human
evaluation shows 23.4% higher complexity, 18.7% better answerability, and 31.2%
improved pattern coverage. Semantic Bridge establishes a new paradigm for LLM
training data synthesis, enabling controllable generation of targeted reasoning
questions from sparse sources. We will release our core code and semantic
bridge model.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了PersonaEval基准，测试LLM在角色识别任务中的表现，发现其准确性远低于人类，表明LLM评估者尚不足以可靠地评判角色扮演质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前角色扮演研究依赖未经验证的LLM评估范式，可能无法反映人类对角色的感知。角色识别是评估角色扮演质量的前提。

Method: 提出PersonaEval基准，使用人类创作的对话数据，测试LLM在角色识别任务中的准确性，并与人类表现对比。

Result: 最佳LLM的准确率仅69%，远低于人类的90.8%，表明LLM评估者尚不可靠。

Conclusion: 可靠的评估需要LLM具备更强的人类推理能力，而不仅仅是任务特定调整。

Abstract: Current role-play studies often rely on unvalidated LLM-as-a-judge paradigms,
which may fail to reflect how humans perceive role fidelity. A key prerequisite
for human-aligned evaluation is role identification, the ability to recognize
who is speaking based on dialogue context. We argue that any meaningful
judgment of role-playing quality (how well a character is played) fundamentally
depends on first correctly attributing words and actions to the correct persona
(who is speaking). We present PersonaEval, the first benchmark designed to test
whether LLM evaluators can reliably identify human roles. PersonaEval uses
human-authored dialogues from novels, scripts, and video transcripts,
challenging models to determine the correct persona according to the
conversation context. Our experiments, including a human study, show that even
the best-performing LLMs reach only around 69% accuracy, well below the level
needed for reliable evaluation. In contrast, human participants perform near
ceiling with 90.8% accuracy, highlighting that current LLM evaluators are still
not human enough to effectively judge role-play scenarios. To better understand
this gap, we examine training-time adaptation and test-time compute, suggesting
that reliable evaluation requires more than task-specific tuning, but depends
on strong, human-like reasoning abilities in LLM evaluators. We release our
benchmark at https://github.com/maple-zhou/PersonaEval.

Result: 实验验证了数据集的有效性，为中文语音语言模型研究奠定了基础。

Conclusion: RealTalk-CN填补了研究空白，为语音语言模型的鲁棒性和多样性评估提供了重要资源。

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable
advancements in multimodal processing, including end-to-end speech-based
language models that enable natural interactions and perform specific tasks in
task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems. However, existing TOD datasets are
predominantly text-based, lacking real speech signals that are essential for
evaluating the robustness of speech-based LLMs. Moreover, existing speech TOD
datasets are primarily English and lack critical aspects such as speech
disfluencies and speaker variations. To address these gaps, we introduce
RealTalk-CN, the first Chinese multi-turn, multi-domain speech-text dual-modal
TOD dataset, comprising 5.4k dialogues (60K utterances, 150 hours) with paired
speech-text annotations. RealTalk-CN captures diverse dialogue scenarios with
annotated spontaneous speech disfluencies, ensuring comprehensive coverage of
real-world complexities in speech dialogue. In addition, we propose a novel
cross-modal chat task that authentically simulates real-world user
interactions, allowing dynamic switching between speech and text modalities.
Our evaluation covers robustness to speech disfluencies, sensitivity to speaker
characteristics, and cross-domain performance. Extensive experiments validate
the effectiveness of RealTalk-CN, establishing a strong foundation for Chinese
speech-based LLMs research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）难以直接整合为统一系统，且训练成本高。本文旨在解决模态对齐、效率等问题。

Method: 采用中央控制器LLM协调专业模型，并行TTS架构实现全双工交互，跨模态记忆系统保持上下文连贯。

Result: 性能提升7.8%，延迟降低10.3%，显著增强可解释性。

Conclusion: MLLM Orchestration无需训练即可实现高效多模态交互，具有模块化和高效优势。

Abstract: Different Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) cannot be integrated into
a unified multimodal input-output system directly. In previous work, training
has been considered as an inevitable component due to challenges in modal
alignment, Text-to-Speech efficiency and other integration issues. In this
paper, we introduce Multimodal Large Language Model Orchestration, an effective
approach for creating interactive multimodal AI systems without additional
training. MLLM Orchestration leverages the inherent reasoning capabilities of
large language models to coordinate specialized models through explicit
workflows, enabling natural multimodal interactions while maintaining
modularity, improving interpretability, and significantly enhancing
computational efficiency. Our orchestration framework is built upon three key
innovations: (1) a central controller LLM that analyzes user inputs and
dynamically routes tasks to appropriate specialized models through carefully
designed agents; (2) a parallel Text-to-Speech architecture that enables true
full-duplex interaction with seamless interruption handling and natural
conversational flow; and (3) a cross-modal memory integration system that
maintains coherent context across modalities through intelligent information
synthesis and retrieval, selectively avoiding unnecessary modality calls in
certain scenarios to improve response speed. Extensive evaluations demonstrate
that MLLM Orchestration achieves comprehensive multimodal capabilities without
additional training, performance improvements of up to 7.8% over traditional
jointly-trained approaches on standard benchmarks, reduced latency by 10.3%,
and significantly enhanced interpretability through explicit orchestration
processes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言中存在大量语义相同但表达不同的句子，LLMs通常无法为这些句子生成一致的下一个词概率。现有方法（如k-NN）是经验性的，本文试图从抽象层面解决这一问题。

Method: 引入LLM Markov范畴表示LLM生成的语言概率分布，并利用范畴同伦技术捕捉范畴中的“弱等价”关系，以处理语言中的等价重述问题。

Result: 提出了一个结合范畴同伦理论的框架，从高阶代数K理论到模型范畴，为LLMs中的概率分布问题提供了理论基础。

Conclusion: 通过范畴同伦技术，论文为LLMs中语义等价但表达不同的句子生成一致概率提供了新的理论工具。

Abstract: Natural language is replete with superficially different statements, such as
``Charles Darwin wrote" and ``Charles Darwin is the author of", which carry the
same meaning. Large language models (LLMs) should generate the same next-token
probabilities in such cases, but usually do not. Empirical workarounds have
been explored, such as using k-NN estimates of sentence similarity to produce
smoothed estimates. In this paper, we tackle this problem more abstractly,
introducing a categorical homotopy framework for LLMs. We introduce an LLM
Markov category to represent probability distributions in language generated by
an LLM, where the probability of a sentence, such as ``Charles Darwin wrote" is
defined by an arrow in a Markov category. However, this approach runs into
difficulties as language is full of equivalent rephrases, and each generates a
non-isomorphic arrow in the LLM Markov category. To address this fundamental
problem, we use categorical homotopy techniques to capture ``weak equivalences"
in an LLM Markov category. We present a detailed overview of application of
categorical homotopy to LLMs, from higher algebraic K-theory to model
categories, building on powerful theoretical results developed over the past
half a century.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小型语言模型（SLMs）在处理复杂多变的自然语言时，需同时完成问题提取和推理，导致优化困难。

Method: 提出DURIT框架，通过三步算法（映射、对齐、训练）在规范问题空间中训练推理策略。

Result: 实验显示DURIT显著提升SLMs在数学和逻辑推理任务中的表现及鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 分离理解与推理是增强SLMs推理能力的有效策略。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in the reasoning capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs), improving the reasoning ability of Small Language Models (SLMs,
e.g., $\leq$ 1.5B) remains challenging. A key obstacle lies in the complexity
and variability of natural language: essentially equivalent problems often
appear in diverse surface forms, often obscured by redundant or distracting
details. This imposes a dual burden on SLMs: they must first extract the core
problem from complex linguistic input, and then perform reasoning based on that
understanding. The resulting vast and noisy problem space hinders optimization,
particularly for models with limited capacity. To address this, we propose a
new framework that decouples understanding from reasoning by mapping natural
language problems into a canonical problem space-a semantically simplified yet
expressive domain. This enables SLMs to focus on reasoning over standardized
inputs, free from linguistic variability. Within this framework, we introduce
DURIT (Decoupled Understanding from Reasoning via Iterative Training), a
three-step algorithm that iteratively: (1) mapping natural language problems
via reinforcement learning, (2) aligns reasoning trajectories through
self-distillation, and (3) trains reasoning policies in the problem space. The
mapper and reasoner are co-trained in an alternating loop throughout this
process. Experiments show that DURIT substantially improves SLMs' performance
on both in-domain and out-of-domain mathematical and logical reasoning tasks.
Beyond improving reasoning capabilities, DURIT also improves the robustness of
reasoning, validating decoupling understanding from reasoning as an effective
strategy for strengthening SLMs.

Motivation: 在联邦学习环境中提升大语言模型的推理能力面临性能、计算、通信和隐私的多重挑战，尤其在医疗领域需要准确且可解释的推理过程。

Method: 提出FedCoT框架，结合轻量级思维链增强机制（生成多推理路径并动态选择最优）和基于LoRA模块的改进聚合方法，以高效处理客户端异构性。

Result: 在医疗推理任务中，FedCoT显著提升了客户端推理性能，同时完全保护数据隐私。

Conclusion: FedCoT为联邦学习环境下的大语言模型推理提供了一种高效、隐私安全的解决方案，特别适用于医疗领域。

Abstract: Efficiently enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) in federated learning environments remains challenging, particularly
when balancing performance gains with strict computational, communication, and
privacy constraints. This challenge is especially acute in healthcare, where
decisions-spanning clinical, operational, and patient-facing contexts-demand
not only accurate outputs but also interpretable, traceable rationales to
ensure safety, accountability, and regulatory compliance. Conventional
federated tuning approaches on LLM fail to address this need: they optimize
primarily for answer correctness while neglecting rationale quality, leaving
CoT capabilities dependent on models' innate pre-training abilities. Moreover,
existing methods for improving rationales typically rely on privacy-violating
knowledge distillation from centralized models. Additionally, the communication
overhead in traditional federated fine-tuning on LLMs remains substantial. We
addresses this gap by proposing FedCoT, a novel framework specifically designed
to enhance reasoning in federated settings. FedCoT leverages a lightweight
chain-of-thought enhancement mechanism: local models generate multiple
reasoning paths, and a compact discriminator dynamically selects the most
promising one. This approach improves reasoning accuracy and robustness while
providing valuable interpretability, which is particularly critical for medical
applications. To manage client heterogeneity efficiently, we adopt an improved
aggregation approach building upon advanced LoRA module stacking, incorporating
client classifier-awareness to achieve noise-free aggregation across diverse
clients. Comprehensive experiments on medical reasoning tasks demonstrate that
FedCoT significantly boosts client-side reasoning performance under stringent
resource budgets while fully preserving data privacy.

Motivation: 金融应用中，从客户历史通信序列学习嵌入是关键，但直接使用LLM处理长序列计算成本高且不实用。

Method: 提出LATTE框架，通过对比学习将行为特征总结为短提示，用LLM嵌入作为监督信号。

Result: 实验表明，LATTE在真实金融数据集上优于现有技术，且适用于延迟敏感环境。

Conclusion: LATTE是一种高效且实用的方法，适用于金融领域的事件序列表示学习。

Abstract: Learning clients embeddings from sequences of their historic communications
is central to financial applications. While large language models (LLMs) offer
general world knowledge, their direct use on long event sequences is
computationally expensive and impractical in real-world pipelines. In this
paper, we propose LATTE, a contrastive learning framework that aligns raw event
embeddings with semantic embeddings from frozen LLMs. Behavioral features are
summarized into short prompts, embedded by the LLM, and used as supervision via
contrastive loss. The proposed approach significantly reduces inference cost
and input size compared to conventional processing of complete sequence by LLM.
We experimentally show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques
for learning event sequence representations on real-world financial datasets
while remaining deployable in latency-sensitive environments.

Conclusion: 该研究为高风险问答应用中可信赖的大型语言模型部署提供了统计严谨的框架。

Abstract: This study introduces a significance testing-enhanced conformal prediction
(CP) framework to improve trustworthiness of large language models (LLMs) in
multiple-choice question answering (MCQA). While LLMs have been increasingly
deployed in disciplinary QA scenarios, hallucination and nonfactual generation
substantially compromise response reliability. Although CP provides
statistically rigorous marginal coverage guarantees for prediction sets, and
significance testing offers established statistical rigor, their synergistic
integration remains unexplored. To mitigate hallucination and factual
inaccuracies, our framework integrates $p$-value computation with conformity
scoring through self-consistency resampling of MCQA responses. This approach
calculates option frequencies to address LLMs' black-box nature, subsequently
constructing prediction sets via null hypothesis testing ($\mathcal{H}_0$) with
empirically derived $p$-values. Evaluations on MMLU and MMLU-Pro benchmarks
using off-the-shelf LLMs demonstrate: (1) The enhanced CP achieves
user-specified empirical miscoverage rates; (2) Test-set average prediction set
size (APSS) decreases monotonically with increasing risk levels ($\alpha$),
validating APSS as an effective uncertainty metric. This work establishes a
principled statistical framework for trustworthy LLM deployment in high-stakes
QA applications.

Motivation: 现有TTC策略（如TTT和RAG）对不同查询效果不一，盲目应用会导致高计算成本。

Method: RTTC采用分布式服务器-客户端架构，结合奖励模型选择策略，并引入查询状态缓存以减少冗余计算。

Result: 实验表明，RTTC在多个LLM和任务中优于传统RAG或TTT，验证了其高效性和准确性。

Conclusion: RTTC证明了自适应TTC策略的必要性，为高性能语言模型适应提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Test-Time Compute (TTC) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing the
performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) at inference, leveraging strategies
such as Test-Time Training (TTT) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
However, the optimal adaptation strategy varies across queries, and
indiscriminate application of TTC strategy incurs substantial computational
overhead. In this work, we introduce Reward-Guided Test-Time Compute (RTTC), a
novel framework that adaptively selects the most effective TTC strategy for
each query via a pretrained reward model, maximizing downstream accuracy across
diverse domains and tasks. RTTC operates in a distributed server-client
architecture, retrieving relevant samples from a remote knowledge base and
applying RAG or lightweight fine-tuning on client devices only when necessary.
To further mitigate redundant computation, we propose Query-State Caching,
which enables the efficient reuse of historical query states at both retrieval
and adaptation levels. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and
benchmarks demonstrate that RTTC consistently achieves superior accuracy
compared to vanilla RAG or TTT, validating the necessity of adaptive,
reward-guided TTC selection and the potential of RTTC for scalable,
high-performance language model adaptation.

Result: PPD检测的各项评估指标达到90%，优于现有文献中的其他解决方案。

Conclusion: 该系统为PPD及其风险因素的快速检测提供了高效、可解释的解决方案，有助于及时评估和干预。

Abstract: Among the many challenges mothers undergo after childbirth, postpartum
depression (PPD) is a severe condition that significantly impacts their mental
and physical well-being. Consequently, the rapid detection of ppd and their
associated risk factors is critical for in-time assessment and intervention
through specialized prevention procedures. Accordingly, this work addresses the
need to help practitioners make decisions with the latest technological
advancements to enable real-time screening and treatment recommendations.
Mainly, our work contributes to an intelligent PPD screening system that
combines Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning (ML), and Large Language
Models (LLMs) towards an affordable, real-time, and non-invasive free speech
analysis. Moreover, it addresses the black box problem since the predictions
are described to the end users thanks to the combination of LLMs with
interpretable ml models (i.e., tree-based algorithms) using feature importance
and natural language. The results obtained are 90 % on ppd detection for all
evaluation metrics, outperforming the competing solutions in the literature.
Ultimately, our solution contributes to the rapid detection of PPD and their
associated risk factors, critical for in-time and proper assessment and
intervention.

TL;DR: SABER是一个强化学习框架，通过用户可控的推理预算优化LLM的推理效率和延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在复杂任务中推理成本高和延迟长的问题。

Method: SABER通过预算分级、系统提示和长度感知奖励进行微调，并支持四种推理模式。

Result: 在多个任务中表现优异，如MATH基准上推理长度减少65.4%，准确率提升3.6%。

Conclusion: SABER在预算限制下实现高效推理，并支持灵活的延迟与深度权衡。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) empowered by chain-of-thought reasoning have
achieved impressive accuracy on complex tasks but suffer from excessive
inference costs and latency when applied uniformly to all problems. We propose
SABER (Switchable and Balanced Training for Efficient LLM Reasoning), a
reinforcement learning framework that endows LLMs with user-controllable,
token-budgeted reasoning. SABER first profiles each training example's
base-model thinking token usage and assigns it to one of the predefined budget
tiers. During fine-tuning, the model is guided by system prompts and
length-aware rewards to respect its assigned budget. In parallel, we
incorporate no-think examples to ensure the model remains reliable even when
explicit reasoning is turned off. SABER further supports four discrete
inference modes - NoThink, FastThink, CoreThink, and DeepThink, enabling
flexible trade-offs between latency and reasoning depth. Extensive evaluations
on math reasoning (MATH, GSM8K), code generation (MBPP), and logical reasoning
(LiveBench-Reasoning) demonstrate that SABER achieves high accuracy under tight
budgets, graceful degradation, and effective cross-scale and cross-domain
generalization. In particular, SABER-FastThink cuts reasoning length by 65.4%
and yields a 3.6% accuracy gain compared with the base model on the MATH
benchmark.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合Transformer嵌入和手工特征的方法，利用合成语音增强数据，用于阿尔茨海默病及相关痴呆症的早期检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿尔茨海默病及相关痴呆症（ADRD）在美国影响约500万老年人，但超过一半未被诊断。基于语音的自然语言处理（NLP）提供了一种可扩展的检测方法。

Method: 开发了一个筛查流程，结合Transformer嵌入与手工特征，测试了使用LLM生成合成语音的数据增强方法，并评估了单模态和多模态LLM分类器。

Result: 融合模型表现最佳（F1=83.3），数据增强后F1提升至85.7。单模态LLM分类器通过微调显著改进，但多模态模型表现较低。

Conclusion: 结合Transformer嵌入和语言特征可提升ADRD检测效果，LLM在分类和数据增强中有效，但多模态模型仍需改进。

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) affect approximately five
million older adults in the U.S., yet over half remain undiagnosed.
Speech-based natural language processing (NLP) offers a promising, scalable
approach to detect early cognitive decline through linguistic markers.
  To develop and evaluate a screening pipeline that (i) fuses transformer
embeddings with handcrafted linguistic features, (ii) tests data augmentation
using synthetic speech generated by large language models (LLMs), and (iii)
benchmarks unimodal and multimodal LLM classifiers for ADRD detection.
  Transcripts from the DementiaBank "cookie-theft" task (n = 237) were used.
Ten transformer models were evaluated under three fine-tuning strategies. A
fusion model combined embeddings from the top-performing transformer with 110
lexical-derived linguistic features. Five LLMs (LLaMA-8B/70B, MedAlpaca-7B,
Ministral-8B, GPT-4o) were fine-tuned to generate label-conditioned synthetic
speech, which was used to augment training data. Three multimodal models
(GPT-4o, Qwen-Omni, Phi-4) were tested for speech-text classification in
zero-shot and fine-tuned settings.
  The fusion model achieved F1 = 83.3 (AUC = 89.5), outperforming linguistic or
transformer-only baselines. Augmenting training data with 2x MedAlpaca-7B
synthetic speech increased F1 to 85.7. Fine-tuning significantly improved
unimodal LLM classifiers (e.g., MedAlpaca: F1 = 47.3 -> 78.5 F1). Current
multimodal models demonstrated lower performance (GPT-4o = 70.2 F1; Qwen =
66.0). Performance gains aligned with the distributional similarity between
synthetic and real speech.
  Integrating transformer embeddings with linguistic features enhances ADRD
detection from speech. Clinically tuned LLMs effectively support both
classification and data augmentation, while further advancement is needed in
multimodal modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法忽视用户个体差异，需一种能同时衡量通用质量和用户对齐的评估框架。

Method: PREF采用三步流程：1）LLM生成通用准则；2）用户偏好重排增强；3）LLM基于个性化准则评分。

Result: 在PrefEval基准测试中，PREF在准确性、校准和人类判断对齐方面优于基线。

Conclusion: PREF为个性化语言生成系统的可靠评估和开发奠定了基础。

Abstract: Personalised text generation is essential for user-centric information
systems, yet most evaluation methods overlook the individuality of users. We
introduce \textbf{PREF}, a \textbf{P}ersonalised \textbf{R}eference-free
\textbf{E}valuation \textbf{F}ramework that jointly measures general output
quality and user-specific alignment without requiring gold personalised
references. PREF operates in a three-step pipeline: (1) a coverage stage uses a
large language model (LLM) to generate a comprehensive, query-specific
guideline covering universal criteria such as factuality, coherence, and
completeness; (2) a preference stage re-ranks and selectively augments these
factors using the target user's profile, stated or inferred preferences, and
context, producing a personalised evaluation rubric; and (3) a scoring stage
applies an LLM judge to rate candidate answers against this rubric, ensuring
baseline adequacy while capturing subjective priorities. This separation of
coverage from preference improves robustness, transparency, and reusability,
and allows smaller models to approximate the personalised quality of larger
ones. Experiments on the PrefEval benchmark, including implicit
preference-following tasks, show that PREF achieves higher accuracy, better
calibration, and closer alignment with human judgments than strong baselines.
By enabling scalable, interpretable, and user-aligned evaluation, PREF lays the
groundwork for more reliable assessment and development of personalised
language generation systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在语言任务中表现出色，但容易受到绕过安全对齐的jailbreak攻击。本文旨在提出一种高效攻击方法并探索防御策略。

Method: LFJ通过选择高相似性的查询对，在关键层和令牌上进行梯度引导的隐藏状态插值，并进行优化以平衡攻击成功率和效率。

Result: 在Vicuna和LLaMA-2等模型上，LFJ的平均攻击成功率为94.01%，优于现有方法。提出的防御方法能将攻击成功率降低80%以上。

Conclusion: LFJ是一种高效的jailbreak攻击方法，同时对抗训练能有效防御此类攻击，为模型安全性提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities in various
language tasks but are susceptible to jailbreak attacks that circumvent their
safety alignments. This paper introduces Latent Fusion Jailbreak (LFJ), a
representation-based attack that interpolates hidden states from harmful and
benign query pairs to elicit prohibited responses. LFJ begins by selecting
query pairs with high thematic and syntactic similarity, then performs
gradient-guided interpolation at influential layers and tokens, followed by
optimization to balance attack success, output fluency, and computational
efficiency. Evaluations on models such as Vicuna and LLaMA-2 across benchmarks
like AdvBench and MaliciousInstruct yield an average attack success rate (ASR)
of 94.01%, outperforming existing methods. To mitigate LFJ, we propose an
adversarial training defense that fine-tunes models on interpolated examples,
reducing ASR by over 80% without degrading performance on benign inputs.
Ablation studies validate the importance of query pair selection, hidden state
interpolation components, and optimization strategies in LFJ's effectiveness.

Result: 在六项任务中验证了PSST的有效性，证明了推理意识在提示优化中的重要性。

Conclusion: IAPO框架通过联合优化提示和推理规模，显著提升了黑盒LLM的对齐效果。

Abstract: Prompt optimization methods have demonstrated significant effectiveness in
aligning black-box large language models (LLMs). In parallel, inference scaling
strategies such as Best-of-N Sampling and Majority Voting have also proven to
enhance alignment and performance by trading off computation. However, existing
prompt optimization approaches are inference strategy agnostic; that is, they
optimize prompts without regard to the inference strategy employed during
deployment. This constitutes a significant methodological gap, as our empirical
and theoretical analysis reveals a strong interdependence between these two
paradigms. Moreover, we find that user preferences regarding trade-offs among
multiple objectives and inference budgets substantially influence the choice of
prompt and inference configuration. To address this gap, we introduce a unified
novel framework named IAPO (Inference-Aware Prompt Optimization) that jointly
optimizes the prompt and inference scale, while being aware of the inference
budget and different task objectives. We then develop a fixed-budget training
algorithm for IAPO, which we call PSST (Prompt Scaling via Sequential
Trimming), and analyze finite-budget guarantees on error probability. Finally,
we evaluate the effectiveness of PSST on six different tasks, including
multi-objective text generation and reasoning, and demonstrate the critical
role of incorporating inference-awareness when aligning black-box LLMs through
prompt optimization.

Motivation: LLMs的思考模式虽被认为有价值，但易受攻击，需解决其安全性问题。

Result: 安全思考干预显著降低了思考模式下LLMs的攻击成功率。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效提升了LLMs思考模式的安全性。

Abstract: Thinking mode has always been regarded as one of the most valuable modes in
LLMs. However, we uncover a surprising and previously overlooked phenomenon:
LLMs with thinking mode are more easily broken by Jailbreak attack. We evaluate
9 LLMs on AdvBench and HarmBench and find that the success rate of attacking
thinking mode in LLMs is almost higher than that of non-thinking mode. Through
large numbers of sample studies, it is found that for educational purposes and
excessively long thinking lengths are the characteristics of successfully
attacked data, and LLMs also give harmful answers when they mostly know that
the questions are harmful. In order to alleviate the above problems, this paper
proposes a method of safe thinking intervention for LLMs, which explicitly
guides the internal thinking processes of LLMs by adding "specific thinking
tokens" of LLMs to the prompt. The results demonstrate that the safe thinking
intervention can significantly reduce the attack success rate of LLMs with
thinking mode.

Result: 在四个基准测试中，APIE显著优于基线方法，提升了提取准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 研究表明，细粒度的双级模型不确定性视图对构建高效可靠的结构化生成系统至关重要。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show remarkable potential for few-shot
information extraction (IE), yet their performance is highly sensitive to the
choice of in-context examples. Conventional selection strategies often fail to
provide informative guidance, as they overlook a key source of model
fallibility: confusion stemming not just from semantic content, but also from
the generation of well-structured formats required by IE tasks. To address
this, we introduce Active Prompting for Information Extraction (APIE), a novel
active prompting framework guided by a principle we term introspective
confusion. Our method empowers an LLM to assess its own confusion through a
dual-component uncertainty metric that uniquely quantifies both Format
Uncertainty (difficulty in generating correct syntax) and Content Uncertainty
(inconsistency in extracted semantics). By ranking unlabeled data with this
comprehensive score, our framework actively selects the most challenging and
informative samples to serve as few-shot exemplars. Extensive experiments on
four benchmarks show that our approach consistently outperforms strong
baselines, yielding significant improvements in both extraction accuracy and
robustness. Our work highlights the critical importance of a fine-grained,
dual-level view of model uncertainty when it comes to building effective and
reliable structured generation systems.

Abstract: Recent advancements in reasoning-reinforced Large Language Models (LLMs) have
shown remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning tasks. However, the
mechanism underlying their utilization of different human reasoning skills
remains poorly investigated, especially for multilingual commonsense reasoning
that involves everyday knowledge across different languages and cultures. To
address this gap, we propose a \textbf{M}ultilingual and Scalable Benchmark for
\textbf{S}kill-based \textbf{Co}mmonsense \textbf{Re}asoning (\textbf{mSCoRe}).
Our benchmark incorporates three key components that are designed to
systematically evaluate LLM's reasoning capabilities, including: (1) a novel
taxonomy of reasoning skills that enables fine-grained analysis of models'
reasoning processes, (2) a robust data synthesis pipeline tailored specifically
for commonsense reasoning evaluation, and (3) a complexity scaling framework
allowing task difficulty to scale dynamically alongside future improvements in
LLM abilities. Extensive experiments on eights state-of-the-art LLMs of varying
sizes and training approaches demonstrate that \textbf{mSCoRe} remains
significantly challenging for current models, particularly at higher complexity
levels. Our results reveal the limitations of such reasoning-reinforced models
when confronted with nuanced multilingual general and cultural commonsense. We
further provide detailed analysis on the models' reasoning processes,
suggesting future directions for improving multilingual commonsense reasoning
capabilities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at solving problems with clear and
complete statements, but often struggle with nuanced environments or
interactive tasks which are common in most real-world scenarios. This
highlights the critical need for developing LLMs that can effectively engage in
logically consistent multi-turn dialogue, seek information and reason with
incomplete data. To this end, we introduce a novel benchmark comprising a suite
of multi-turn tasks each designed to test specific reasoning, interactive
dialogue, and information-seeking abilities. These tasks have deterministic
scoring mechanisms, thus eliminating the need for human intervention.
Evaluating frontier models on our benchmark reveals significant headroom. Our
analysis shows that most errors emerge from poor instruction following,
reasoning failures, and poor planning. This benchmark provides valuable
insights into the strengths and weaknesses of current LLMs in handling complex,
interactive scenarios and offers a robust platform for future research aimed at
improving these critical capabilities.

Conclusion: LaaJMeter为低资源环境下的LaaJ评估提供了可扩展的解决方案，有助于确保NLP评估的可信性和可重复性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as evaluators in natural
language processing tasks, a paradigm known as LLM-as-a-Judge (LaaJ). While
effective in general domains, LaaJs pose significant challenges in
domain-specific contexts, where annotated data is scarce and expert evaluation
is costly. In such cases, meta-evaluation is often performed using metrics that
have not been validated for the specific domain in which they are applied. As a
result, it becomes difficult to determine which metrics effectively identify
LaaJ quality, and further, what threshold indicates sufficient evaluator
performance. In this work, we introduce LaaJMeter, a simulation-based framework
for controlled meta-evaluation of LaaJs. LaaJMeter enables engineers to
generate synthetic data representing virtual models and judges, allowing
systematic analysis of evaluation metrics under realistic conditions. This
helps practitioners validate and refine LaaJs for specific evaluation tasks:
they can test whether their metrics correctly distinguish between better and
worse (virtual) LaaJs, and estimate appropriate thresholds for evaluator
adequacy.
  We demonstrate the utility of LaaJMeter in a code translation task involving
a legacy programming language, showing how different metrics vary in
sensitivity to evaluator quality. Our results highlight the limitations of
common metrics and the importance of principled metric selection. LaaJMeter
provides a scalable and extensible solution for assessing LaaJs in low-resource
settings, contributing to the broader effort to ensure trustworthy and
reproducible evaluation in NLP.

Conclusion: 翻译难度估计有助于构建更具挑战性的机器翻译基准，Sentinel-src模型为未来研究提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Machine translation quality has began achieving near-perfect translations in
some setups. These high-quality outputs make it difficult to distinguish
between state-of-the-art models and to identify areas for future improvement.
Automatically identifying texts where machine translation systems struggle
holds promise for developing more discriminative evaluations and guiding future
research.
  We formalize the task of translation difficulty estimation, defining a text's
difficulty based on the expected quality of its translations. We introduce a
new metric to evaluate difficulty estimators and use it to assess both
baselines and novel approaches. Finally, we demonstrate the practical utility
of difficulty estimators by using them to construct more challenging machine
translation benchmarks. Our results show that dedicated models (dubbed
Sentinel-src) outperform both heuristic-based methods (e.g. word rarity or
syntactic complexity) and LLM-as-a-judge approaches. We release two improved
models for difficulty estimation, Sentinel-src-24 and Sentinel-src-25, which
can be used to scan large collections of texts and select those most likely to
challenge contemporary machine translation systems.

Conclusion: For-Value为大规模模型提供了一种高效且可扩展的数据影响评估方法。

Abstract: Quantifying the influence of individual training samples is essential for
enhancing the transparency and accountability of large language models (LLMs)
and vision-language models (VLMs). However, existing data valuation methods
often rely on Hessian information or model retraining, making them
computationally prohibitive for billion-parameter models. In this work, we
introduce For-Value, a forward-only data valuation framework that enables
scalable and efficient influence estimation for both LLMs and VLMs. By
leveraging the rich representations of modern foundation models, For-Value
computes influence scores using a simple closed-form expression based solely on
a single forward pass, thereby eliminating the need for costly gradient
computations. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that For-Value accurately
estimates per-sample influence by capturing alignment in hidden representations
and prediction errors between training and validation samples. Extensive
experiments show that For-Value matches or outperforms gradient-based baselines
in identifying impactful fine-tuning examples and effectively detecting
mislabeled data.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various
applications, it is empirical to ensure their fairness across all user
communities. However, most LLMs are trained and evaluated on Western centric
data, with little attention paid to low-resource languages and regional
contexts. To address this gap, we introduce PakBBQ, a culturally and regionally
adapted extension of the original Bias Benchmark for Question Answering (BBQ)
dataset. PakBBQ comprises over 214 templates, 17180 QA pairs across 8
categories in both English and Urdu, covering eight bias dimensions including
age, disability, appearance, gender, socio-economic status, religious, regional
affiliation, and language formality that are relevant in Pakistan. We evaluate
multiple multilingual LLMs under both ambiguous and explicitly disambiguated
contexts, as well as negative versus non negative question framings. Our
experiments reveal (i) an average accuracy gain of 12\% with disambiguation,
(ii) consistently stronger counter bias behaviors in Urdu than in English, and
(iii) marked framing effects that reduce stereotypical responses when questions
are posed negatively. These findings highlight the importance of contextualized
benchmarks and simple prompt engineering strategies for bias mitigation in low
resource settings.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) is challenged by
hallucinations, critical failure modes where models generate non-factual,
nonsensical or unfaithful text. This paper introduces Semantic Divergence
Metrics (SDM), a novel lightweight framework for detecting Faithfulness
Hallucinations -- events of severe deviations of LLMs responses from input
contexts. We focus on a specific implementation of these LLM errors,
{confabulations, defined as responses that are arbitrary and semantically
misaligned with the user's query. Existing methods like Semantic Entropy test
for arbitrariness by measuring the diversity of answers to a single, fixed
prompt. Our SDM framework improves upon this by being more prompt-aware: we
test for a deeper form of arbitrariness by measuring response consistency not
only across multiple answers but also across multiple, semantically-equivalent
paraphrases of the original prompt. Methodologically, our approach uses joint
clustering on sentence embeddings to create a shared topic space for prompts
and answers. A heatmap of topic co-occurances between prompts and responses can
be viewed as a quantified two-dimensional visualization of the user-machine
dialogue. We then compute a suite of information-theoretic metrics to measure
the semantic divergence between prompts and responses. Our practical score,
$\mathcal{S}_H$, combines the Jensen-Shannon divergence and Wasserstein
distance to quantify this divergence, with a high score indicating a
Faithfulness hallucination. Furthermore, we identify the KL divergence

These metrics are further combined into the Semantic Box, a diagnostic

*Andrew X. Chen,Guillermo Horga,Sean Escola*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 利用大型语言模型（LLMs）从临床访谈记录中预测精神病高危患者的BPRS评分，结果显示其性能接近人类评估者的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 精神病高危患者需要密切监测症状，但常用的BPRS评分工具因耗时较长未在临床中广泛应用。

Method: 使用LLMs分析409名患者的临床访谈记录，预测BPRS评分，并评估其零样本、跨语言和纵向学习能力。

Result: LLMs预测的BPRS评分与真实评估高度一致（中位数一致性0.84，ICC 0.73），且在跨语言和纵向学习中表现优异。

Conclusion: LLMs有望标准化精神病高危患者的症状评估，并提升临床效率。

Abstract: Patients who are at clinical high risk (CHR) for schizophrenia need close
monitoring of their symptoms to inform appropriate treatments. The Brief
Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) is a validated, commonly used research tool for
measuring symptoms in patients with schizophrenia and other psychotic
disorders; however, it is not commonly used in clinical practice as it requires
a lengthy structured interview. Here, we utilize large language models (LLMs)
to predict BPRS scores from clinical interview transcripts in 409 CHR patients
from the Accelerating Medicines Partnership Schizophrenia (AMP-SCZ) cohort.
Despite the interviews not being specifically structured to measure the BPRS,
the zero-shot performance of the LLM predictions compared to the true
assessment (median concordance: 0.84, ICC: 0.73) approaches human inter- and
intra-rater reliability. We further demonstrate that LLMs have substantial
potential to improve and standardize the assessment of CHR patients via their
accuracy in assessing the BPRS in foreign languages (median concordance: 0.88,
ICC: 0.70), and integrating longitudinal information in a one-shot or few-shot
learning approach.

Motivation: 探究人工语言Toki Pona是否像自然语言一样受社会语言学因素影响，并随时间演变。

Method: 采用计算和语料库方法，分析词类流动性和及物性，比较不同语料库的用法差异。

Result: 社会语言学因素对Toki Pona的影响与自然语言类似，人工语言系统会随社区使用自然演变。

Conclusion: 人工语言Toki Pona在社区使用中会自然演变，受社会语言学因素影响，与自然语言类似。

Abstract: This study explores language change and variation in Toki Pona, a constructed
language with approximately 120 core words. Taking a computational and
corpus-based approach, the study examines features including fluid word classes
and transitivity in order to examine (1) changes in preferences of content
words for different syntactic positions over time and (2) variation in usage
across different corpora. The results suggest that sociolinguistic factors
influence Toki Pona in the same way as natural languages, and that even
constructed linguistic systems naturally evolve as communities use them.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM对提示词微小变化敏感，利用其输出优化提示词可更好地匹配模型的归纳偏置。

Method: 提出归纳偏置提取与匹配策略，将LLM输出作为提示词的一部分。

Result: 分类任务的Likert评分提升19%，排序任务提升27%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效优化提示词，显著提升LLM任务表现。

Abstract: The active research topic of prompt engineering makes it evident that LLMs
are sensitive to small changes in prompt wording. A portion of this can be
ascribed to the inductive bias that is present in the LLM. By using an LLM's
output as a portion of its prompt, we can more easily create satisfactory
wording for prompts. This has the effect of creating a prompt that matches the
inductive bias in model. Empirically, we show that using this Inductive Bias
Extraction and Matching strategy improves LLM Likert ratings used for
classification by up to 19% and LLM Likert ratings used for ranking by up to
27%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前偏检测方法多为定量且自动化，忽略了语言中偏见的细微表现，需定性方法补充。

Method: 通过手动分析LLM生成的关于黑人和白人女性的短故事，探讨性别和种族偏见。

Result: 黑人女性被描绘为与祖先和抵抗相关，白人女性则表现为自我发现；模型修正偏见时仅做表面修改。

Conclusion: 研究强调了批判性、跨学科方法对AI设计和部署的重要性，以应对LLM生成内容中的不平等问题。

Abstract: With the advance of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Large Language Models
(LLMs) have gained prominence and been applied in diverse contexts. As they
evolve into more sophisticated versions, it is essential to assess whether they
reproduce biases, such as discrimination and racialization, while maintaining
hegemonic discourses. Current bias detection approaches rely mostly on
quantitative, automated methods, which often overlook the nuanced ways in which
biases emerge in natural language. This study proposes a qualitative,
discursive framework to complement such methods. Through manual analysis of
LLM-generated short stories featuring Black and white women, we investigate
gender and racial biases. We contend that qualitative methods such as the one
proposed here are fundamental to help both developers and users identify the
precise ways in which biases manifest in LLM outputs, thus enabling better
conditions to mitigate them. Results show that Black women are portrayed as
tied to ancestry and resistance, while white women appear in self-discovery
processes. These patterns reflect how language models replicate crystalized
discursive representations, reinforcing essentialization and a sense of social
immobility. When prompted to correct biases, models offered superficial
revisions that maintained problematic meanings, revealing limitations in
fostering inclusive narratives. Our results demonstrate the ideological
functioning of algorithms and have significant implications for the ethical use
and development of AI. The study reinforces the need for critical,
interdisciplinary approaches to AI design and deployment, addressing how
LLM-generated discourses reflect and perpetuate inequalities.

Abstract: Peer review is essential for scientific progress but faces growing challenges
due to increasing submission volumes and reviewer fatigue. Existing automated
review approaches struggle with factual accuracy, rating consistency, and
analytical depth, often generating superficial or generic feedback lacking the
insights characteristic of high-quality human reviews. We introduce ReviewRL, a
reinforcement learning framework for generating comprehensive and factually
grounded scientific paper reviews. Our approach combines: (1) an ArXiv-MCP
retrieval-augmented context generation pipeline that incorporates relevant
scientific literature, (2) supervised fine-tuning that establishes foundational
reviewing capabilities, and (3) a reinforcement learning procedure with a
composite reward function that jointly enhances review quality and rating
accuracy. Experiments on ICLR 2025 papers demonstrate that ReviewRL
significantly outperforms existing methods across both rule-based metrics and
model-based quality assessments. ReviewRL establishes a foundational framework
for RL-driven automatic critique generation in scientific discovery,
demonstrating promising potential for future development in this domain. The
implementation of ReviewRL will be released at GitHub.

TL;DR: DOTABLER是一个专注于表格语义解析的框架，通过深度分析表格与上下文的关联，实现高级语义任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注表格的表面任务（如布局分析、数据提取），缺乏对表格及其上下文语义关联的深度解析，限制了高级任务（如跨段落数据解释）。

Method: DOTABLER利用定制数据集和预训练模型微调，构建完整的解析流程，识别与表格语义关联的上下文片段。

Result: 在4000页真实PDF文档（含1000多个表格）上测试，DOTABLER的Precision和F1分数超过90%，优于GPT-4o等先进模型。

Conclusion: DOTABLER在表格语义分析和深度文档解析方面表现出色，为高级语义任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Documents are core carriers of information and knowl-edge, with broad
applications in finance, healthcare, and scientific research. Tables, as the
main medium for structured data, encapsulate key information and are among the
most critical document components. Existing studies largely focus on
surface-level tasks such as layout analysis, table detection, and data
extraction, lacking deep semantic parsing of tables and their contextual
associations. This limits advanced tasks like cross-paragraph data
interpretation and context-consistent analysis. To address this, we propose
DOTABLER, a table-centric semantic document parsing framework designed to
uncover deep semantic links between tables and their context. DOTABLER
leverages a custom dataset and domain-specific fine-tuning of pre-trained
models, integrating a complete parsing pipeline to identify context segments
semantically tied to tables. Built on this semantic understanding, DOTABLER
implements two core functionalities: table-centric document structure parsing
and domain-specific table retrieval, delivering comprehensive table-anchored
semantic analysis and precise extraction of semantically relevant tables.
Evaluated on nearly 4,000 pages with over 1,000 tables from real-world PDFs,
DOTABLER achieves over 90% Precision and F1 scores, demonstrating superior
performance in table-context semantic analysis and deep document parsing
compared to advanced models such as GPT-4o.

TL;DR: 论文提出FreLLM4Rec方法，通过频谱视角平衡语义和协同信息，解决LLM推荐系统中协同信号衰减问题，性能提升显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM推荐系统过度依赖语义关联，导致协同信号在传播中衰减，影响性能。

Method: 采用全局图低通滤波（G-LPF）和时序频率调制（TFM）分别净化嵌入和逐层保留协同信号。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上，FreLLM4Rec显著减少协同信号衰减，NDCG@10提升最高达8.00%。

Conclusion: FreLLM4Rec为LLM处理协同信息提供新思路，并提升推荐系统性能。

Abstract: Recommender systems in concert with Large Language Models (LLMs) present
promising avenues for generating semantically-informed recommendations.
However, LLM-based recommenders exhibit a tendency to overemphasize semantic
correlations within users' interaction history. When taking pretrained
collaborative ID embeddings as input, LLM-based recommenders progressively
weaken the inherent collaborative signals as the embeddings propagate through
LLM backbones layer by layer, as opposed to traditional Transformer-based
sequential models in which collaborative signals are typically preserved or
even enhanced for state-of-the-art performance. To address this limitation, we
introduce FreLLM4Rec, an approach designed to balance semantic and
collaborative information from a spectral perspective. Item embeddings that
incorporate both semantic and collaborative information are first purified
using a Global Graph Low-Pass Filter (G-LPF) to preliminarily remove irrelevant
high-frequency noise. Temporal Frequency Modulation (TFM) then actively
preserves collaborative signal layer by layer. Note that the collaborative
preservation capability of TFM is theoretically guaranteed by establishing a
connection between the optimal but hard-to-implement local graph fourier
filters and the suboptimal yet computationally efficient frequency-domain
filters. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that
FreLLM4Rec successfully mitigates collaborative signal attenuation and achieves
competitive performance, with improvements of up to 8.00\% in NDCG@10 over the
best baseline. Our findings provide insights into how LLMs process
collaborative information and offer a principled approach for improving
LLM-based recommendation systems.

Motivation: 探索软提示在多语言任务中的潜力，尤其是针对低性能语言的表现提升。

Method: 结合轻量级编码架构和多源训练设计XPE，并提出双软提示机制。

Result: XPE对低性能语言效果显著，而混合设计在多语言场景中更具适应性。

Conclusion: XPE和双软提示机制为多语言任务提供了高效且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Soft prompts have emerged as a powerful alternative to adapters in
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), enabling large language models (LLMs)
to adapt to downstream tasks without architectural changes or parameter
updates. While prior work has focused on stabilizing training via parameter
interaction in small neural prompt encoders, their broader potential for
transfer across languages remains unexplored. In this paper, we demonstrate
that a prompt encoder can play a central role in improving performance on
low-performing languages-those that achieve poor accuracy even under full-model
fine-tuning. We introduce the Cross-Prompt Encoder (XPE), which combines a
lightweight encoding architecture with multi-source training on typologically
diverse languages - a design that enables the model to capture abstract and
transferable patterns across languages. To complement XPE, we propose a Dual
Soft Prompt mechanism that combines an encoder-based prompt with a directly
trained standard soft prompt. This hybrid design proves especially effective
for target languages that benefit from both broadly shared structure and
language-specific alignment. Experiments on the SIB-200 benchmark reveal a
consistent trade-off: XPE is most effective for low-performing languages, while
hybrid variants offer broader adaptability across multilingual settings.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型在韩语推理任务中的性能不足问题，并提升其整体问题解决能力。

Method: 第一阶段使用监督微调（SFT）训练韩语推理数据集；第二阶段采用自定义GRPO算法进行强化学习，引入裁判模型解决训练稳定性问题。

Result: 模型在韩语推理任务中表现显著提升，同时在数学和编程任务中也有进步，且能完全用韩语进行内部推理。

Conclusion: 两阶段微调方法有效提升了Qwen3 14B的韩语推理能力，并解决了GRPO训练中的稳定性问题。

Abstract: We present a two-stage fine-tuning approach to make the large language model
Qwen3 14B "think" natively in Korean. In the first stage, supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) on a high-quality Korean reasoning dataset establishes a
strong foundation in Korean logical reasoning, yielding notable improvements in
Korean-language tasks and even some gains in general reasoning ability. In the
second stage, we employ reinforcement learning with a customized Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm to further enhance both Korean reasoning
alignment and overall problem-solving performance. We address critical
stability challenges in GRPO training - such as reward hacking and policy
collapse - by introducing an oracle judge model that calibrates the reward
signal. Our approach achieves stable learning (avoiding the collapse observed
in naive GRPO) and leads to steady, incremental performance gains. The final
RL-tuned model demonstrates substantially improved results on advanced
reasoning benchmarks (particularly math and coding tasks) while maintaining
knowledge and language proficiency, successfully conducting its internal
chain-of-thought entirely in Korean.

Conclusion: 该方法为跨语言ABSA提供了高效替代方案，且优于英语中心的大型语言模型。

Abstract: Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) has made significant strides, yet
challenges remain for low-resource languages due to the predominant focus on
English. Current cross-lingual ABSA studies often centre on simpler tasks and
rely heavily on external translation tools. In this paper, we present a novel
sequence-to-sequence method for compound ABSA tasks that eliminates the need
for such tools. Our approach, which uses constrained decoding, improves
cross-lingual ABSA performance by up to 10\%. This method broadens the scope of
cross-lingual ABSA, enabling it to handle more complex tasks and providing a
practical, efficient alternative to translation-dependent techniques.
Furthermore, we compare our approach with large language models (LLMs) and show
that while fine-tuned multilingual LLMs can achieve comparable results,
English-centric LLMs struggle with these tasks.

Abstract: Text summarization is the task of shortening a larger body of text into a
concise version while retaining its essential meaning and key information.
While summarization has been significantly explored in English and other
high-resource languages, Czech text summarization, particularly for historical
documents, remains underexplored due to linguistic complexities and a scarcity
of annotated datasets. Large language models such as Mistral and mT5 have
demonstrated excellent results on many natural language processing tasks and
languages. Therefore, we employ these models for Czech summarization, resulting
in two key contributions: (1) achieving new state-of-the-art results on the
modern Czech summarization dataset SumeCzech using these advanced models, and
(2) introducing a novel dataset called Posel od \v{C}erchova for summarization
of historical Czech documents with baseline results. Together, these
contributions provide a great potential for advancing Czech text summarization
and open new avenues for research in Czech historical text processing.

Abstract: While aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) has made substantial progress,
challenges remain for low-resource languages, which are often overlooked in
favour of English. Current cross-lingual ABSA approaches focus on limited, less
complex tasks and often rely on external translation tools. This paper
introduces a novel approach using constrained decoding with
sequence-to-sequence models, eliminating the need for unreliable translation
tools and improving cross-lingual performance by 5\% on average for the most
complex task. The proposed method also supports multi-tasking, which enables
solving multiple ABSA tasks with a single model, with constrained decoding
boosting results by more than 10\%.
  We evaluate our approach across seven languages and six ABSA tasks,
surpassing state-of-the-art methods and setting new benchmarks for previously
unexplored tasks. Additionally, we assess large language models (LLMs) in
zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning scenarios. While LLMs perform poorly in
zero-shot and few-shot settings, fine-tuning achieves competitive results
compared to smaller multilingual models, albeit at the cost of longer training
and inference times.
  We provide practical recommendations for real-world applications, enhancing
the understanding of cross-lingual ABSA methodologies. This study offers
valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of cross-lingual ABSA
approaches, advancing the state-of-the-art in this challenging research domain.

Result: MDH框架有效平衡了准确性和效率；新攻击策略显著提高了越狱成功率。

Conclusion: MDH框架和新攻击策略为恶意内容检测和越狱攻击评估提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Evaluating jailbreak attacks is challenging when prompts are not overtly
harmful or fail to induce harmful outputs. Unfortunately, many existing
red-teaming datasets contain such unsuitable prompts. To evaluate attacks
accurately, these datasets need to be assessed and cleaned for maliciousness.
However, existing malicious content detection methods rely on either manual
annotation, which is labor-intensive, or large language models (LLMs), which
have inconsistent accuracy in harmful types. To balance accuracy and
efficiency, we propose a hybrid evaluation framework named MDH (Malicious
content Detection based on LLMs with Human assistance) that combines LLM-based
annotation with minimal human oversight, and apply it to dataset cleaning and
detection of jailbroken responses. Furthermore, we find that well-crafted
developer messages can significantly boost jailbreak success, leading us to
propose two new strategies: D-Attack, which leverages context simulation, and
DH-CoT, which incorporates hijacked chains of thought. The Codes, datasets,
judgements, and detection results will be released in github repository:

Conclusion: SFPF为红队策略提供了新思路，但其效果因提示和层而异，通用性需进一步验证。

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of Natural Language Processing (NLP), especially
Large Language Models (LLMs), generating adversarial examples to jailbreak LLMs
remains a key challenge for understanding model vulnerabilities and improving
robustness. In this context, we propose a new black-box attack method that
leverages the interpretability of large models. We introduce the Sparse Feature
Perturbation Framework (SFPF), a novel approach for adversarial text generation
that utilizes sparse autoencoders to identify and manipulate critical features
in text. After using the SAE model to reconstruct hidden layer representations,
we perform feature clustering on the successfully attacked texts to identify
features with higher activations. These highly activated features are then
perturbed to generate new adversarial texts. This selective perturbation
preserves the malicious intent while amplifying safety signals, thereby
increasing their potential to evade existing defenses. Our method enables a new
red-teaming strategy that balances adversarial effectiveness with safety
alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that adversarial texts generated by
SFPF can bypass state-of-the-art defense mechanisms, revealing persistent
vulnerabilities in current NLP systems.However, the method's effectiveness
varies across prompts and layers, and its generalizability to other
architectures and larger models remains to be validated.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长故事和小说因其复杂的情节和动态的角色关系，对LLM的推理能力提出了挑战。传统RAG方法因静态单步检索而难以捕捉动态关系。

Method: ComoRAG采用迭代推理循环，通过动态记忆工作区生成探测查询并整合新证据，支持连贯上下文生成。

Result: 在四个长上下文叙事基准测试中，ComoRAG比最强基线性能提升11%，尤其擅长全局理解的复杂查询。

Conclusion: ComoRAG为基于检索的长上下文理解提供了一种认知启发的状态推理范式，代码已开源。

Abstract: Narrative comprehension on long stories and novels has been a challenging
domain attributed to their intricate plotlines and entangled, often evolving
relations among characters and entities. Given the LLM's diminished reasoning
over extended context and high computational cost, retrieval-based approaches
remain a pivotal role in practice. However, traditional RAG methods can fall
short due to their stateless, single-step retrieval process, which often
overlooks the dynamic nature of capturing interconnected relations within
long-range context. In this work, we propose ComoRAG, holding the principle
that narrative reasoning is not a one-shot process, but a dynamic, evolving
interplay between new evidence acquisition and past knowledge consolidation,
analogous to human cognition when reasoning with memory-related signals in the
brain. Specifically, when encountering a reasoning impasse, ComoRAG undergoes
iterative reasoning cycles while interacting with a dynamic memory workspace.
In each cycle, it generates probing queries to devise new exploratory paths,
then integrates the retrieved evidence of new aspects into a global memory
pool, thereby supporting the emergence of a coherent context for the query
resolution. Across four challenging long-context narrative benchmarks (200K+

### [89] [Evaluating LLMs on Chinese Idiom Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10421)
*Cai Yang,Yao Dou,David Heineman,Xiaofeng Wu,Wei Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了IdiomEval框架，用于评估中文成语翻译的错误，发现现有翻译系统表现不佳，并开发了改进模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中文成语翻译在机器翻译中研究较少，现有系统表现不佳，需要更全面的评估和改进方法。

Method: 构建IdiomEval框架，标注900对翻译数据，分析九种现代翻译系统的表现，并提出改进模型。

Result: 现有系统在成语翻译中错误率高，最佳系统GPT-4错误率为28%；改进模型F1分数达0.68。

Conclusion: IdiomEval框架有效评估成语翻译，改进模型显著提升错误检测能力。

Abstract: Idioms, whose figurative meanings usually differ from their literal
interpretations, are common in everyday language, especially in Chinese, where
they often contain historical references and follow specific structural
patterns. Despite recent progress in machine translation with large language
models, little is known about Chinese idiom translation. In this work, we
introduce IdiomEval, a framework with a comprehensive error taxonomy for
Chinese idiom translation. We annotate 900 translation pairs from nine modern
systems, including GPT-4o and Google Translate, across four domains: web, news,
Wikipedia, and social media. We find these systems fail at idiom translation,
producing incorrect, literal, partial, or even missing translations. The
best-performing system, GPT-4, makes errors in 28% of cases. We also find that
existing evaluation metrics measure idiom quality poorly with Pearson
correlation below 0.48 with human ratings. We thus develop improved models that
achieve F$_1$ scores of 0.68 for detecting idiom translation errors.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于计算经济学的框架，通过激励驱动训练优化LLMs的计算效率，减少40%的FLOPS并保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的高计算成本限制了其应用，需要一种方法来优化计算资源分配。

Method: 引入计算经济学框架，将LLM视为资源受限的代理（注意力头和神经元块）的内部经济，通过激励驱动训练优化计算分配。

Result: 在GLUE和WikiText-103任务上，该方法在保持准确性的同时减少了40%的FLOPS，并提升了注意力模式的可解释性。

Conclusion: 经济原则为设计高效、自适应且透明的LLMs提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are limited by substantial computational cost.
We introduce a "computational economics" framework that treats an LLM as an
internal economy of resource-constrained agents (attention heads and neuron
blocks) that must allocate scarce computation to maximize task utility. First,
we show empirically that when computation is scarce, standard LLMs reallocate
attention toward high-value tokens while preserving accuracy. Building on this
observation, we propose an incentive-driven training paradigm that augments the
task loss with a differentiable computation cost term, encouraging sparse and
efficient activations. On GLUE (MNLI, STS-B, CoLA) and WikiText-103, the method
yields a family of models that trace a Pareto frontier and consistently
dominate post-hoc pruning; for a similar accuracy we obtain roughly a forty
percent reduction in FLOPS and lower latency, together with more interpretable
attention patterns. These results indicate that economic principles offer a
principled route to designing efficient, adaptive, and more transparent LLMs
under strict resource constraints.

TL;DR: DiFaR是一个生成多样化、事实准确且相关的文本解释的框架，用于增强多模态虚假信息检测，解决了现有方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法生成的解释存在多样性不足、事实错误和无关内容的问题，限制了虚假信息检测的效果。

Method: DiFaR通过五种链式思维提示从大型视觉语言模型中生成多样化的推理轨迹，并结合轻量级后过滤模块筛选事实性和相关性高的句子。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，DiFaR比基线方法提升了5.9%，并可将现有检测器的性能提升8.7%。

Conclusion: DiFaR显著提升了生成解释的质量，为多模态虚假信息检测提供了更有效的支持。

Abstract: Generating textual rationales from large vision-language models (LVLMs) to
support trainable multimodal misinformation detectors has emerged as a
promising paradigm. However, its effectiveness is fundamentally limited by
three core challenges: (i) insufficient diversity in generated rationales, (ii)
factual inaccuracies due to hallucinations, and (iii) irrelevant or conflicting
content that introduces noise. We introduce DiFaR, a detector-agnostic
framework that produces diverse, factual, and relevant rationales to enhance
misinformation detection. DiFaR employs five chain-of-thought prompts to elicit
varied reasoning traces from LVLMs and incorporates a lightweight post-hoc
filtering module to select rationale sentences based on sentence-level
factuality and relevance scores. Extensive experiments on four popular
benchmarks demonstrate that DiFaR outperforms four baseline categories by up to
5.9% and boosts existing detectors by as much as 8.7%. Both automatic metrics
and human evaluations confirm that DiFaR significantly improves rationale
quality across all three dimensions.

Result: 发现隐私与可解释性的关系复杂，受任务性质和具体方法影响，但二者有共存潜力。

Conclusion: 总结隐私与可解释性共存的可能，并提出未来研究的实用建议。

Abstract: In the study of trustworthy Natural Language Processing (NLP), a number of
important research fields have emerged, including that of
\textit{explainability} and \textit{privacy}. While research interest in both
explainable and privacy-preserving NLP has increased considerably in recent
years, there remains a lack of investigation at the intersection of the two.
This leaves a considerable gap in understanding of whether achieving
\textit{both} explainability and privacy is possible, or whether the two are at
odds with each other. In this work, we conduct an empirical investigation into
the privacy-explainability trade-off in the context of NLP, guided by the
popular overarching methods of \textit{Differential Privacy} (DP) and Post-hoc
Explainability. Our findings include a view into the intricate relationship
between privacy and explainability, which is formed by a number of factors,
including the nature of the downstream task and choice of the text
privatization and explainability method. In this, we highlight the potential
for privacy and explainability to co-exist, and we summarize our findings in a
collection of practical recommendations for future work at this important
intersection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在推理中过度依赖文本而忽视其他模态，导致文本主导问题。本文旨在系统研究此问题并提出解决方案。

Method: 提出了两种评估指标（MDI和AEI）来衡量模态不平衡，并通过分析发现三种成因，提出令牌压缩方法。

Result: 文本主导问题在所有测试模态中普遍存在，令牌压缩方法显著改善了模型的平衡性（如LLaVA-7B的MDI从10.23降至0.86）。

Conclusion: 研究为开发更公平、全面的多模态语言模型提供了基础，提出的方法有效缓解了文本主导问题。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities across a diverse range of multimodal tasks. However, these models
suffer from a core problem known as text dominance: they depend heavily on text
for their inference, while underutilizing other modalities. While prior work
has acknowledged this phenomenon in vision-language tasks, often attributing it
to data biases or model architectures. In this paper, we conduct the first
systematic investigation of text dominance across diverse data modalities,
including images, videos, audio, time-series, and graphs. To measure this
imbalance, we propose two evaluation metrics: the Modality Dominance Index
(MDI) and the Attention Efficiency Index (AEI). Our comprehensive analysis
reveals that text dominance is both significant and pervasive across all tested
modalities. Our in-depth analysis identifies three underlying causes: attention
dilution from severe token redundancy in non-textual modalities, the influence
of fusion architecture design, and task formulations that implicitly favor
textual inputs. Furthermore, we propose a simple token compression method that
effectively rebalances model attention. Applying this method to LLaVA-7B, for
instance, drastically reduces its MDI from 10.23 to a well-balanced value of
0.86. Our analysis and methodological framework offer a foundation for the
development of more equitable and comprehensive multimodal language models.

mechanistic interpretability research on large language models. The need for
widespread accessibility of LLM interpretability infrastructure in Europe
drives this initiative to democratize advanced model analysis capabilities for

Ansbach University of Applied Sciences and interconnected with partner
institutions, enabling remote model inspection via the NNsight API. A
structured pilot study involving 16 researchers from across Europe evaluated
the platform's technical performance, usability, and scientific utility. Users
conducted interventions such as activation patching, causal tracing, and
representation analysis on models including GPT-2 and DeepSeek-R1-70B. The
study revealed a gradual increase in user engagement, stable platform
performance throughout, and a positive reception of the remote experimentation
capabilities. It also marked the starting point for building a user community
around the platform. Identified limitations such as prolonged download
durations for activation data as well as intermittent execution interruptions
are addressed in the roadmap for future development. This initiative marks a
significant step towards widespread accessibility of LLM interpretability
infrastructure in Europe and lays the groundwork for broader deployment,
expanded tooling, and sustained community collaboration in mechanistic

Conclusion: 该方法为未来研究设定了基准，强调了无注释翻译对提升聋人和听力障碍者沟通可访问性的重要性。

Abstract: Millions of individuals worldwide are affected by deafness and hearing
impairment. Sign language serves as a sophisticated means of communication for
the deaf and hard of hearing. However, in societies that prioritize spoken
languages, sign language often faces underestimation, leading to communication
barriers and social exclusion. The Continuous Bangla Sign Language Translation
project aims to address this gap by enhancing translation methods. While recent
approaches leverage transformer architecture for state-of-the-art results, our
method integrates graph-based methods with the transformer architecture. This
fusion, combining transformer and STGCN-LSTM architectures, proves more
effective in gloss-free translation. Our contributions include architectural
fusion, exploring various fusion strategies, and achieving a new
state-of-the-art performance on diverse sign language datasets, namely
RWTH-PHOENIX-2014T, CSL-Daily, How2Sign, and BornilDB v1.0. Our approach
demonstrates superior performance compared to current translation outcomes
across all datasets, showcasing notable improvements of BLEU-4 scores of 4.01,
2.07, and 0.5, surpassing those of GASLT, GASLT and slt_how2sign in
RWTH-PHOENIX-2014T, CSL-Daily, and How2Sign, respectively. Also, we introduce
benchmarking on the BornilDB v1.0 dataset for the first time. Our method sets a
benchmark for future research, emphasizing the importance of gloss-free
translation to improve communication accessibility for the deaf and hard of
hearing.

Motivation: 当前基于标量奖励的个性化方法反馈较弱，限制了学习效率和质量，需要更丰富的监督信号。

Method: VAC框架通过交替优化反馈模型和策略模型，利用NLF指导模型迭代优化生成结果。

Result: 在LaMP-QA基准测试中显著优于现有方法，人类评估也证实生成质量更高。

Conclusion: NLF能更有效地优化个性化问答，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Personalization is crucial for enhancing both the effectiveness and user
satisfaction of language technologies, particularly in information-seeking
tasks like question answering. Current approaches for personalizing large
language models (LLMs) often rely on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG),
followed by reinforcement learning with scalar reward signals to teach models
how to use retrieved personal context. We believe that these scalar rewards
sometimes provide weak, non-instructive feedback, limiting learning efficiency
and personalization quality. We introduce VAC, a novel framework for
personalized response generation that replaces scalar rewards with natural
language feedback (NLF) that are generated conditioned on the user profiles and
the question narratives. NLF serves as a rich and actionable supervision
signal, allowing the policy model to iteratively refine its outputs and
internalize effective personalization strategies. Training alternates between
optimizing the feedback model and fine-tuning the policy model on the improved
responses, resulting in a policy model that no longer requires feedback at
inference. Evaluation on the LaMP-QA benchmark that consists of three diverse
domains demonstrates consistent and significant improvements over the
state-of-the-art results. Human evaluations further confirm the superior
quality of the generated responses. These results demonstrate that NLF provides
more effective signals for optimizing personalized question answering.

Conclusion: ICE为dLLMs提供了高效灵活的原位提示策略，显著提升性能并降低计算开销。

Abstract: Despite large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success, their
prefix-only prompting paradigm and sequential generation process offer limited
flexibility for bidirectional information. Diffusion large language models
(dLLMs) present new opportunities through their bidirectional attention
mechanisms and iterative refinement processes, enabling more flexible in-place
prompting strategies. We introduce ICE (In-Place Chain-of-Thought Prompting
with Early Exit), a novel framework that transforms prefix-only prompting into
in-place prompting specifically designed for dLLMs. ICE integrates in-place
prompts directly within masked token positions during iterative refinement and
employs a confidence-aware early exit mechanism to significantly reduce
computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate ICE's effectiveness,
achieving up to 17.29% accuracy improvement with 4.12$\times$ speedup on GSM8K,
and up to 276.67$\times$ acceleration on MMLU while maintaining competitive
performance.

extraction from submissions, retrieval and synthesis of related work, and
structured comparison for evidence based assessment. Our method is informed by
a large scale analysis of human written novelty reviews and captures key
patterns such as independent claim verification and contextual reasoning.
Evaluated on 182 ICLR 2025 submissions with human annotated reviewer novelty
assessments, the approach achieves 86.5% alignment with human reasoning and
75.3% agreement on novelty conclusions - substantially outperforming existing
LLM based baselines. The method produces detailed, literature aware analyses
and improves consistency over ad hoc reviewer judgments. These results
highlight the potential for structured LLM assisted approaches to support more
rigorous and transparent peer review without displacing human expertise. Data

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在序列决策任务中有潜力，但依赖大规模模型限制了应用。现有方法无法处理多步任务中的信用分配问题。

Method: 提出了基于TSMG和LAP框架的MS-GRPO算法，采用累积奖励分配和绝对优势加权采样策略。

Result: 实验表明，经过MS-GRPO训练的3B参数模型在Frozen Lake任务中性能优于72B基线模型50%。

Conclusion: 定向后训练是提升小型LLMs在序列决策任务中性能的实用高效方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show potential as sequential decision-making
agents, but their application is often limited due to a reliance on large,
computationally expensive models. This creates a need to improve smaller
models, yet existing post-training methods are designed for single-turn
interactions and cannot handle credit assignment in multi-step agentic tasks.
To address this, we introduce Multi-Step Group-Relative Policy Optimization
(MS-GRPO), a new algorithm for post-training LLM agents, grounded in formal
Text-Mediated Stochastic Game (TSMG) and Language-Agent Policy (LAP)
frameworks. For credit assignment, MS-GRPO attributes the entire cumulative
episode reward to each individual episode step. We supplement this algorithm
with a novel absolute-advantage-weighted episode sampling strategy that we show
improves training performance. We evaluate our approach by post-training a
3-billion parameter model on Snake and Frozen Lake. Our experiments demonstrate
that the method is effective in improving decision-making performance: our
post-trained 3B parameter model outperforms a 72B parameter baseline by 50% on
the Frozen Lake task. This work demonstrates that targeted post-training is a
practical and efficient alternative to relying on model scale for creating
sequential decision-making agents using LLMs.

Abstract: Amidst a shortage of qualified mental health professionals, the integration
of large language models (LLMs) into psychological applications offers a
promising way to alleviate the growing burden of mental health disorders.
Recent reasoning-augmented LLMs have achieved remarkable performance in
mathematics and programming, while research in the psychological domain has
predominantly emphasized emotional support and empathetic dialogue, with
limited attention to reasoning mechanisms that are beneficial to generating
reliable responses. Therefore, in this paper, we propose Psyche-R1, the first
Chinese psychological LLM that jointly integrates empathy, psychological
expertise, and reasoning, built upon a novel data curation pipeline.
Specifically, we design a comprehensive data synthesis pipeline that produces
over 75k high-quality psychological questions paired with detailed rationales,
generated through chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and iterative
prompt-rationale optimization, along with 73k empathetic dialogues.
Subsequently, we employ a hybrid training strategy wherein challenging samples
are identified through a multi-LLM cross-selection strategy for group relative
policy optimization (GRPO) to improve reasoning ability, while the remaining
data is used for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance empathetic response
generation and psychological domain knowledge. Extensive experiment results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the Psyche-R1 across several psychological
benchmarks, where our 7B Psyche-R1 achieves comparable results to 671B
DeepSeek-R1.

Abstract: Recent advancements in machine learning have spurred growing interests in
automated interpreting quality assessment. Nevertheless, existing research
suffers from insufficient examination of language use quality, unsatisfactory
modeling effectiveness due to data scarcity and imbalance, and a lack of
efforts to explain model predictions. To address these gaps, we propose a
multi-dimensional modeling framework that integrates feature engineering, data
augmentation, and explainable machine learning. This approach prioritizes
explainability over ``black box'' predictions by utilizing only
construct-relevant, transparent features and conducting Shapley Value (SHAP)
analysis. Our results demonstrate strong predictive performance on a novel
English-Chinese consecutive interpreting dataset, identifying BLEURT and
CometKiwi scores to be the strongest predictive features for fidelity,
pause-related features for fluency, and Chinese-specific phraseological
diversity metrics for language use. Overall, by placing particular emphasis on
explainability, we present a scalable, reliable, and transparent alternative to
traditional human evaluation, facilitating the provision of detailed diagnostic
feedback for learners and supporting self-regulated learning advantages not
afforded by automated scores in isolation.

Conclusion: LLMs具备可有效提取的世界知识，SSRL能减少幻觉并支持更可扩展的RL代理训练。

Abstract: We investigate the potential of large language models (LLMs) to serve as
efficient simulators for agentic search tasks in reinforcement learning (RL),
thereby reducing dependence on costly interactions with external search
engines. To this end, we first quantify the intrinsic search capability of LLMs
via structured prompting and repeated sampling, which we term Self-Search. Our
results reveal that LLMs exhibit strong scaling behavior with respect to the
inference budget, achieving high pass@k on question-answering benchmarks,
including the challenging BrowseComp task. Building on these observations, we
introduce Self-Search RL (SSRL), which enhances LLMs' Self-Search capability
through format-based and rule-based rewards. SSRL enables models to iteratively
refine their knowledge utilization internally, without requiring access to
external tools. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that SSRL-trained policy
models provide a cost-effective and stable environment for search-driven RL
training, reducing reliance on external search engines and facilitating robust
sim-to-real transfer. We draw the following conclusions: 1) LLMs possess world
knowledge that can be effectively elicited to achieve high performance; 2) SSRL
demonstrates the potential of leveraging internal knowledge to reduce
hallucination; 3) SSRL-trained models integrate seamlessly with external search
engines without additional effort. Our findings highlight the potential of LLMs

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Conclusion: DLMs是一个快速发展的领域，未来需进一步优化效率和扩展应用场景。

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) are rapidly emerging as a powerful and
promising alternative to the dominant autoregressive (AR) paradigm. By
generating tokens in parallel through an iterative denoising process, DLMs
possess inherent advantages in reducing inference latency and capturing
bidirectional context, thereby enabling fine-grained control over the
generation process. While achieving a several-fold speed-up, recent
advancements have allowed DLMs to show performance comparable to their
autoregressive counterparts, making them a compelling choice for various
natural language processing tasks. In this survey, we provide a holistic
overview of the current DLM landscape. We trace its evolution and relationship
with other paradigms, such as autoregressive and masked language models, and
cover both foundational principles and state-of-the-art models. Our work offers
an up-to-date, comprehensive taxonomy and an in-depth analysis of current
techniques, from pre-training strategies to advanced post-training methods.
Another contribution of this survey is a thorough review of DLM inference
strategies and optimizations, including improvements in decoding parallelism,
caching mechanisms, and generation quality. We also highlight the latest
approaches to multimodal extensions of DLMs and delineate their applications
across various practical scenarios. Furthermore, our discussion addresses the
limitations and challenges of DLMs, including efficiency, long-sequence
handling, and infrastructure requirements, while outlining future research
directions to sustain progress in this rapidly evolving field. Project GitHub

### [105] [Stochastic-based Patch Filtering for Few-Shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10066)
*Javier Rodenas,Eduardo Aguilar,Petia Radeva*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于随机性补丁过滤的少样本学习方法（SPFF），用于解决食物图像因视觉复杂性和多样性导致的分类问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 食物图像的视觉复杂性和多样性（如不同装饰、光照和视角）导致少样本学习模型难以聚焦关键特征，从而引发误分类。

Method: SPFF通过随机过滤补丁嵌入，保留与类别表示相关性高的补丁，并使用相似性矩阵量化查询图像与支持图像的关系。

Result: 实验表明，SPFF能有效聚焦类别特异性特征，并在Food-101、VireoFood-172和UECFood-256数据集上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SPFF通过随机过滤补丁嵌入，显著提升了少样本食物图像分类的性能。

Abstract: Food images present unique challenges for few-shot learning models due to
their visual complexity and variability. For instance, a pasta dish might
appear with various garnishes on different plates and in diverse lighting
conditions and camera perspectives. This problem leads to losing focus on the
most important elements when comparing the query with support images, resulting
in misclassification. To address this issue, we propose Stochastic-based Patch
Filtering for Few-Shot Learning (SPFF) to attend to the patch embeddings that
show greater correlation with the class representation. The key concept of SPFF
involves the stochastic filtering of patch embeddings, where patches less
similar to the class-aware embedding are more likely to be discarded. With
patch embedding filtered according to the probability of appearance, we use a
similarity matrix that quantifies the relationship between the query image and
its respective support images. Through a qualitative analysis, we demonstrate
that SPFF effectively focuses on patches where class-specific food features are
most prominent while successfully filtering out non-relevant patches. We
validate our approach through extensive experiments on few-shot classification
benchmarks: Food-101, VireoFood-172 and UECFood-256, outperforming the existing
SoA methods.

TL;DR: DINOv3是一种自监督学习的视觉基础模型，通过数据扩展、Gram锚定和后期优化策略，实现了在多种视觉任务上的卓越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 消除手动数据标注的需求，通过单一算法从多样化的数据源中学习视觉表示。

Method: 结合数据扩展和模型规模优化，引入Gram锚定解决密集特征图退化问题，并应用后期策略增强模型灵活性。

Result: DINOv3在多种视觉任务上表现优异，显著超越之前的自监督和弱监督基础模型。

Conclusion: DINOv3为视觉任务提供了可扩展的解决方案，推动了自监督学习的发展。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning holds the promise of eliminating the need for manual
data annotation, enabling models to scale effortlessly to massive datasets and
larger architectures. By not being tailored to specific tasks or domains, this
training paradigm has the potential to learn visual representations from
diverse sources, ranging from natural to aerial images -- using a single
algorithm. This technical report introduces DINOv3, a major milestone toward
realizing this vision by leveraging simple yet effective strategies. First, we
leverage the benefit of scaling both dataset and model size by careful data
preparation, design, and optimization. Second, we introduce a new method called
Gram anchoring, which effectively addresses the known yet unsolved issue of
dense feature maps degrading during long training schedules. Finally, we apply
post-hoc strategies that further enhance our models' flexibility with respect
to resolution, model size, and alignment with text. As a result, we present a
versatile vision foundation model that outperforms the specialized state of the
art across a broad range of settings, without fine-tuning. DINOv3 produces
high-quality dense features that achieve outstanding performance on various
vision tasks, significantly surpassing previous self- and weakly-supervised
foundation models. We also share the DINOv3 suite of vision models, designed to
advance the state of the art on a wide spectrum of tasks and data by providing
scalable solutions for diverse resource constraints and deployment scenarios.

Abstract: Morphing attack detection has become an essential component of face
recognition systems for ensuring a reliable verification scenario. In this
paper, we present a multimodal learning approach that can provide a textual
description of morphing attack detection. We first show that zero-shot
evaluation of the proposed framework using Contrastive Language-Image
Pretraining (CLIP) can yield not only generalizable morphing attack detection,
but also predict the most relevant text snippet. We present an extensive
analysis of ten different textual prompts that include both short and long
textual prompts. These prompts are engineered by considering the human
understandable textual snippet. Extensive experiments were performed on a face
morphing dataset that was developed using a publicly available face biometric
dataset. We present an evaluation of SOTA pre-trained neural networks together
with the proposed framework in the zero-shot evaluation of five different
morphing generation techniques that are captured in three different mediums.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大型视觉语言模型的可解释甲骨文破译方法，结合部首分析和象形语义理解，提升零样本破译能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 甲骨文因其稀有性、抽象性和象形多样性，破译难度大，现有深度学习方法忽视字形与语义的关联，导致泛化性和可解释性不足。

Method: 采用渐进式训练策略，从部首识别到象形分析，设计部首-象形双重匹配机制，并构建包含47,157个汉字的象形破译数据集。

Result: 在公开基准测试中取得Top-10准确率，零样本破译能力优越，并提供逻辑分析过程。

Conclusion: 该方法为未破译甲骨文提供考古参考，在数字人文和历史研究中有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: As the oldest mature writing system, Oracle Bone Script (OBS) has long posed
significant challenges for archaeological decipherment due to its rarity,
abstractness, and pictographic diversity. Current deep learning-based methods
have made exciting progress on the OBS decipherment task, but existing
approaches often ignore the intricate connections between glyphs and the
semantics of OBS. This results in limited generalization and interpretability,
especially when addressing zero-shot settings and undeciphered OBS. To this
end, we propose an interpretable OBS decipherment method based on Large
Vision-Language Models, which synergistically combines radical analysis and
pictograph-semantic understanding to bridge the gap between glyphs and meanings
of OBS. Specifically, we propose a progressive training strategy that guides
the model from radical recognition and analysis to pictographic analysis and
mutual analysis, thus enabling reasoning from glyph to meaning. We also design
a Radical-Pictographic Dual Matching mechanism informed by the analysis
results, significantly enhancing the model's zero-shot decipherment
performance. To facilitate model training, we propose the Pictographic
Decipherment OBS Dataset, which comprises 47,157 Chinese characters annotated
with OBS images and pictographic analysis texts. Experimental results on public
benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art Top-10
accuracy and superior zero-shot decipherment capabilities. More importantly,
our model delivers logical analysis processes, possibly providing
archaeologically valuable reference results for undeciphered OBS, and thus has
potential applications in digital humanities and historical research. The
dataset and code will be released in https://github.com/PKXX1943/PD-OBS.

Abstract: Total-body dual X-ray absorptiometry (TBDXA) imaging is a relatively low-cost
whole-body imaging modality, widely used for body composition assessment. We
develop and validate a deep learning method for automatic fiducial point
placement on TBDXA scans using 1,683 manually-annotated TBDXA scans. The method
achieves 99.5% percentage correct keypoints in an external testing dataset. To
demonstrate the value for shape and appearance modeling (SAM), our method is
used to place keypoints on 35,928 scans for five different TBDXA imaging modes,
then associations with health markers are tested in two cohorts not used for
SAM model generation using two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests. SAM feature
distributions associated with health biomarkers are shown to corroborate
existing evidence and generate new hypotheses on body composition and shape's
relationship to various frailty, metabolic, inflammation, and cardiometabolic
health markers. Evaluation scripts, model weights, automatic point file

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态融合方法依赖Transformer的注意力机制隐式学习特征相关性，难以捕捉模态本质特征和复杂结构。

Method: 提出可逆交叉注意力层（ICA）和三种新交叉注意力机制（MMCA、IMCA、LICA），并设计多模态注意力归一化流以扩展至高维数据。

Result: 在语义分割、图像到图像翻译和电影类型分类三个任务中取得最先进性能。

Conclusion: MANGO方法显式、可解释地学习多模态数据相关性，性能优越。

Abstract: Multimodal learning has gained much success in recent years. However, current
multimodal fusion methods adopt the attention mechanism of Transformers to
implicitly learn the underlying correlation of multimodal features. As a
result, the multimodal model cannot capture the essential features of each
modality, making it difficult to comprehend complex structures and correlations
of multimodal inputs. This paper introduces a novel Multimodal Attention-based
Normalizing Flow (MANGO) approach\footnote{The source code of this work will be
publicly available.} to developing explicit, interpretable, and tractable
multimodal fusion learning. In particular, we propose a new Invertible
Cross-Attention (ICA) layer to develop the Normalizing Flow-based Model for
multimodal data. To efficiently capture the complex, underlying correlations in
multimodal data in our proposed invertible cross-attention layer, we propose
three new cross-attention mechanisms: Modality-to-Modality Cross-Attention
(MMCA), Inter-Modality Cross-Attention (IMCA), and Learnable Inter-Modality
Cross-Attention (LICA). Finally, we introduce a new Multimodal Attention-based
Normalizing Flow to enable the scalability of our proposed method to
high-dimensional multimodal data. Our experimental results on three different
multimodal learning tasks, i.e., semantic segmentation, image-to-image
translation, and movie genre classification, have illustrated the
state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance of the proposed approach.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了结合少量真实图像与合成图像是否能提升西瓜病害分类模型的性能，发现混合使用显著提高了模型表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估生成式AI模型在农业病害诊断中的潜力，减少对资源密集型实地数据收集的依赖。

Method: 使用五种不同比例的真实与合成图像训练EfficientNetV2-L模型，并评估其分类性能。

Result: 混合真实与合成图像的模型（H3-H4）表现最佳，F1分数从0.65提升至1.00。

Conclusion: 合成图像不能完全替代真实图像，混合使用可最大化模型性能。

Abstract: The current advancements in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) models
have paved the way for new possibilities for generating high-resolution
synthetic images, thereby offering a promising alternative to traditional image
acquisition for training computer vision models in agriculture. In the context
of crop disease diagnosis, GenAI models are being used to create synthetic
images of various diseases, potentially facilitating model creation and
reducing the dependency on resource-intensive in-field data collection.
However, limited research has been conducted on evaluating the effectiveness of
integrating real with synthetic images to improve disease classification
performance. Therefore, this study aims to investigate whether combining a
limited number of real images with synthetic images can enhance the prediction
accuracy of an EfficientNetV2-L model for classifying watermelon
\textit{(Citrullus lanatus)} diseases. The training dataset was divided into
five treatments: H0 (only real images), H1 (only synthetic images), H2 (1:1
real-to-synthetic), H3 (1:10 real-to-synthetic), and H4 (H3 + random images to
improve variability and model generalization). All treatments were trained
using a custom EfficientNetV2-L architecture with enhanced fine-tuning and
transfer learning techniques. Models trained on H2, H3, and H4 treatments
demonstrated high precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. Additionally, the
weighted F1-score increased from 0.65 (on H0) to 1.00 (on H3-H4) signifying
that the addition of a small number of real images with a considerable volume
of synthetic images improved model performance and generalizability. Overall,
this validates the findings that synthetic images alone cannot adequately
substitute for real images; instead, both must be used in a hybrid manner to
maximize model performance for crop disease classification.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于合成数据生成的高效框架，用于提升视觉语言模型（VLMs）在工业泄漏检测等安全关键领域的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于隐私、数据敏感性和罕见事件，真实数据稀缺，传统微调方法在工业场景中不可行。

Method: 通过高质量合成数据生成管道，结合参数高效微调（PEFT）技术，提升YOLO和DETR等检测器的性能。

Result: 合成数据显著提升了VLM和检测器的性能，使其在未见泄漏场景中的表现接近。

Conclusion: 高保真合成数据是解决安全关键领域数据稀缺问题的有效途径，结合轻量级适配，为工业环境提供了一种经济高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have transformed general-purpose
visual recognition through strong zero-shot capabilities. However, their
performance degrades significantly in niche, safety-critical domains such as
industrial spill detection, where hazardous events are rare, sensitive, and
difficult to annotate. This scarcity -- driven by privacy concerns, data
sensitivity, and the infrequency of real incidents -- renders conventional
fine-tuning of detectors infeasible for most industrial settings.
  We address this challenge by introducing a scalable framework centered on a
high-quality synthetic data generation pipeline. We demonstrate that this
synthetic corpus enables effective Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of
VLMs and substantially boosts the performance of state-of-the-art object
detectors such as YOLO and DETR. Notably, in the absence of synthetic data
(SynSpill dataset), VLMs still generalize better to unseen spill scenarios than
these detectors. When SynSpill is used, both VLMs and detectors achieve marked
improvements, with their performance becoming comparable.
  Our results underscore that high-fidelity synthetic data is a powerful means
to bridge the domain gap in safety-critical applications. The combination of
synthetic generation and lightweight adaptation offers a cost-effective,
scalable pathway for deploying vision systems in industrial environments where
real data is scarce/impractical to obtain.

*Yuning Huang,Jiahao Pang,Fengqing Zhu,Dong Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）是一种新兴的视图合成方法，具有快速训练/渲染和高质量视觉效果的优点。本文提出了一种因子化和参数化的熵编码方法EntropyGS，用于压缩3DGS高斯属性，实现了约30倍的码率降低，同时保持相似的渲染质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS的高斯创建和视图渲染通常在时间或设备上分离，因此需要存储/传输和压缩高斯属性。本文通过分析高斯属性的统计特性，提出了一种高效的压缩方法。

Method: 首先对3DGS高斯属性进行相关性和统计分析，发现球谐AC属性遵循拉普拉斯分布，而旋转、缩放和不透明度可用高斯混合模型近似。随后提出EntropyGS方法，通过估计每个属性的分布参数进行熵编码，并根据属性类型自适应量化。

Result: EntropyGS在基准数据集上实现了约30倍的码率降低，同时保持与输入3DGS数据相似的渲染质量，且编码和解码速度快。

Conclusion: EntropyGS是一种高效的3DGS高斯属性压缩方法，适用于实际应用中的存储和传输需求。

Abstract: As an emerging novel view synthesis approach, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
demonstrates fast training/rendering with superior visual quality. The two
tasks of 3DGS, Gaussian creation and view rendering, are typically separated
over time or devices, and thus storage/transmission and finally compression of
3DGS Gaussians become necessary. We begin with a correlation and statistical
analysis of 3DGS Gaussian attributes. An inspiring finding in this work reveals
that spherical harmonic AC attributes precisely follow Laplace distributions,
while mixtures of Gaussian distributions can approximate rotation, scaling, and
opacity. Additionally, harmonic AC attributes manifest weak correlations with
other attributes except for inherited correlations from a color space. A
factorized and parameterized entropy coding method, EntropyGS, is hereinafter
proposed. During encoding, distribution parameters of each Gaussian attribute
are estimated to assist their entropy coding. The quantization for entropy
coding is adaptively performed according to Gaussian attribute types. EntropyGS
demonstrates about 30x rate reduction on benchmark datasets while maintaining
similar rendering quality compared to input 3DGS data, with a fast encoding and
decoding time.

Abstract: Xenium, a new spatial transcriptomics platform, enables
subcellular-resolution profiling of complex tumor tissues. Despite the rich

features and integrating them with spatial transcriptomics data remains a
critical challenge. We introduce CellSymphony, a flexible multimodal framework
that leverages foundation model-derived embeddings from both Xenium
transcriptomic profiles and histology images at true single-cell resolution. By
learning joint representations that fuse spatial gene expression with
morphological context, CellSymphony achieves accurate cell type annotation and
uncovers distinct microenvironmental niches across three cancer types. This
work highlights the potential of foundation models and multimodal fusion for
deciphering the physiological and phenotypic orchestration of cells within
complex tissue ecosystems.

Abstract: Crack detection plays a crucial role in civil infrastructures, including
inspection of pavements, buildings, etc., and deep learning has significantly
advanced this field in recent years. While numerous technical and review papers
exist in this domain, emerging trends are reshaping the landscape. These shifts
include transitions in learning paradigms (from fully supervised learning to
semi-supervised, weakly-supervised, unsupervised, few-shot, domain adaptation
and fine-tuning foundation models), improvements in generalizability (from
single-dataset performance to cross-dataset evaluation), and diversification in
dataset reacquisition (from RGB images to specialized sensor-based data). In
this review, we systematically analyze these trends and highlight
representative works. Additionally, we introduce a new dataset collected with
3D laser scans, 3DCrack, to support future research and conduct extensive

Motivation: 解决大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）因视觉输入验证能力有限而产生的幻觉问题。

Result: 实验表明，MRFD显著减少幻觉并提高事实性，且无需模型更新。

Conclusion: MRFD是一种有效的训练无关方法，可提升LVLM的视觉一致性。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown strong performance across
multimodal tasks. However, they often produce hallucinations -- text that is
inconsistent with visual input, due to the limited ability to verify
information in different regions of the image. To address this, we propose
Multi-Region Fusion Decoding (MRFD), a training-free decoding method that
improves factual grounding by modeling inter-region consistency. MRFD
identifies salient regions using cross-attention, generates initial responses
for each, and computes reliability weights based on Jensen-Shannon Divergence
(JSD) among the responses. These weights guide a consistency-aware fusion of
per-region predictions, using region-aware prompts inspired by Chain-of-Thought
reasoning. Experiments across multiple LVLMs and benchmarks show that MRFD
significantly reduces hallucinations and improves response factuality without
requiring model updates.

<details>

Motivation: 现有PoG估计器因个体差异和头部姿态变化导致泛化能力不足，需改进校准策略以提高准确性。

Method: 构建MobilePoG基准数据集，分析校准点和头部姿态多样性对估计精度的影响，提出动态校准策略。

Result: 实验表明，校准过程中引入更广泛的头部姿态能提升估计器对姿态变化的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 动态校准策略通过自然引入头部姿态变化，生成更鲁棒的PoG估计器，优于传统方法。

Abstract: Although appearance-based point-of-gaze (PoG) estimation has improved, the
estimators still struggle to generalize across individuals due to personal
differences. Therefore, person-specific calibration is required for accurate
PoG estimation. However, calibrated PoG estimators are often sensitive to head
pose variations. To address this, we investigate the key factors influencing
calibrated estimators and explore pose-robust calibration strategies.
Specifically, we first construct a benchmark, MobilePoG, which includes facial
images from 32 individuals focusing on designated points under either fixed or
continuously changing head poses. Using this benchmark, we systematically
analyze how the diversity of calibration points and head poses influences
estimation accuracy. Our experiments show that introducing a wider range of
head poses during calibration improves the estimator's ability to handle pose
variation. Building on this insight, we propose a dynamic calibration strategy
in which users fixate on calibration points while moving their phones. This
strategy naturally introduces head pose variation during a user-friendly and
efficient calibration process, ultimately producing a better calibrated PoG
estimator that is less sensitive to head pose variations than those using
conventional calibration strategies. Codes and datasets are available at our
project page.

Abstract: This paper addresses the performance bottlenecks of existing text-driven
image generation methods in terms of semantic alignment accuracy and structural
consistency. A high-fidelity image generation method is proposed by integrating
text-image contrastive constraints with structural guidance mechanisms. The
approach introduces a contrastive learning module that builds strong
cross-modal alignment constraints to improve semantic matching between text and
image. At the same time, structural priors such as semantic layout maps or edge
sketches are used to guide the generator in spatial-level structural modeling.
This enhances the layout completeness and detail fidelity of the generated
images. Within the overall framework, the model jointly optimizes contrastive
loss, structural consistency loss, and semantic preservation loss. A
multi-objective supervision mechanism is adopted to improve the semantic
consistency and controllability of the generated content. Systematic
experiments are conducted on the COCO-2014 dataset. Sensitivity analyses are
performed on embedding dimensions, text length, and structural guidance
strength. Quantitative metrics confirm the superior performance of the proposed
method in terms of CLIP Score, FID, and SSIM. The results show that the method
effectively bridges the gap between semantic alignment and structural fidelity
without increasing computational complexity. It demonstrates a strong ability
to generate semantically clear and structurally complete images, offering a
viable technical path for joint text-image modeling and image generation.

Motivation: 花样滑冰跳跃动作识别需要专业知识，现有TAS方法因数据不足和忽略三维特性而受限。

Method: 提出VIFSS方法，结合对比学习和动作分类，构建FS-Jump3D数据集，并引入精细标注方案。

Conclusion: 框架有效解决了数据不足和三维特性问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Understanding human actions from videos plays a critical role across various
domains, including sports analytics. In figure skating, accurately recognizing
the type and timing of jumps a skater performs is essential for objective
performance evaluation. However, this task typically requires expert-level
knowledge due to the fine-grained and complex nature of jump procedures. While
recent approaches have attempted to automate this task using Temporal Action
Segmentation (TAS), there are two major limitations to TAS for figure skating:
the annotated data is insufficient, and existing methods do not account for the
inherent three-dimensional aspects and procedural structure of jump actions. In
this work, we propose a new TAS framework for figure skating jumps that
explicitly incorporates both the three-dimensional nature and the semantic
procedure of jump movements. First, we propose a novel View-Invariant, Figure
Skating-Specific pose representation learning approach (VIFSS) that combines
contrastive learning as pre-training and action classification as fine-tuning.
For view-invariant contrastive pre-training, we construct FS-Jump3D, the first
publicly available 3D pose dataset specialized for figure skating jumps.
Second, we introduce a fine-grained annotation scheme that marks the ``entry
(preparation)'' and ``landing'' phases, enabling TAS models to learn the
procedural structure of jumps. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our framework. Our method achieves over 92% F1@50 on
element-level TAS, which requires recognizing both jump types and rotation
levels. Furthermore, we show that view-invariant contrastive pre-training is
particularly effective when fine-tuning data is limited, highlighting the
practicality of our approach in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and large language models
(LLMs) have greatly enhanced visual reasoning, a key capability for embodied AI
agents like robots. However, existing visual reasoning benchmarks often suffer
from several limitations: they lack a clear definition of reasoning complexity,
offer have no control to generate questions over varying difficulty and task
customization, and fail to provide structured, step-by-step reasoning
annotations (workflows). To bridge these gaps, we formalize reasoning
complexity, introduce an adaptive query engine that generates customizable
questions of varying complexity with detailed intermediate annotations, and
extend the JRDB dataset with human-object interaction and geometric
relationship annotations to create JRDB-Reasoning, a benchmark tailored for
visual reasoning in human-crowded environments. Our engine and benchmark enable
fine-grained evaluation of visual reasoning frameworks and dynamic assessment
of visual-language models across reasoning levels.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于相位一致性加权最小绝对偏差（PCWLAD）的亚像素模板匹配方法，用于提高多模态光学图像的匹配精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态光学图像匹配精度常因不同光谱响应引起的非线性辐射和几何变形差异而降低。

Method: 方法分为粗匹配（使用SSIM）和细匹配（使用WLAD），并通过相位一致性保留结构细节，采用互结构滤波减少噪声影响。

Result: 在三种数据集上测试，PCWLAD在正确匹配率和均方根误差上优于现有八种方法，平均匹配精度达0.4像素。

Conclusion: PCWLAD在多模态图像匹配中表现优异，软件和数据集已公开。

Abstract: High-accuracy matching of multimodal optical images is the basis of geometric
processing. However, the image matching accuracy is usually degraded by the
nonlinear radiation and geometric deformation differences caused by different
spectral responses. To address these problems, we proposed a phase consistency
weighted least absolute deviation (PCWLAD) sub-pixel template matching method
to improve the matching accuracy of multimodal optical images. This method
consists of two main steps: coarse matching with the structural similarity
index measure (SSIM) and fine matching with WLAD. In the coarse matching step,
PCs are calculated without a noise filter to preserve the original structural
details, and template matching is performed using the SSIM. In the fine
matching step, we applied the radiometric and geometric transformation models
between two multimodal PC templates based on the coarse matching. Furthermore,
mutual structure filtering is adopted in the model to mitigate the impact of
noise within the corresponding templates on the structural consistency, and the
WLAD criterion is used to estimate the sub-pixel offset. To evaluate the
performance of PCWLAD, we created three types of image datasets: visible to
infrared Landsat images, visible to near-infrared close-range images, and
visible to infrared uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) images. PCWLAD outperformed
existing state-of-the-art eight methods in terms of correct matching rate (CMR)
and root mean square error (RMSE) and reached an average matching accuracy of
approximately 0.4 pixels across all three datasets. Our software and datasets
are publicly available at https://github.com/huangtaocsu/PCWLAD.

Motivation: 现有方法通常将单人及多人动态分开处理，难以捕捉真实场景中的自然交互和协调。InterSyn旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 框架包含两个模块：INS（联合建模单人及交互行为）和REC（优化角色间的动态协调）。

Result: 实验表明，InterSyn生成的动作序列在文本对齐性和多样性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: InterSyn为自然运动合成设定了新基准，未来将开源代码以推动研究。

Abstract: We present Interleaved Learning for Motion Synthesis (InterSyn), a novel
framework that targets the generation of realistic interaction motions by
learning from integrated motions that consider both solo and multi-person
dynamics. Unlike previous methods that treat these components separately,
InterSyn employs an interleaved learning strategy to capture the natural,
dynamic interactions and nuanced coordination inherent in real-world scenarios.
Our framework comprises two key modules: the Interleaved Interaction Synthesis
(INS) module, which jointly models solo and interactive behaviors in a unified
paradigm from a first-person perspective to support multiple character
interactions, and the Relative Coordination Refinement (REC) module, which
refines mutual dynamics and ensures synchronized motions among characters.
Experimental results show that the motion sequences generated by InterSyn
exhibit higher text-to-motion alignment and improved diversity compared with
recent methods, setting a new benchmark for robust and natural motion
synthesis. Additionally, our code will be open-sourced in the future to promote
further research and development in this area.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OoD) detection and segmentation have attracted growing
attention as concerns about AI security rise. Conventional OoD detection
methods identify the existence of OoD objects but lack spatial localization,
limiting their usefulness in downstream tasks. OoD segmentation addresses this
limitation by localizing anomalous objects at pixel-level granularity. This
capability is crucial for safety-critical applications such as autonomous
driving, where perception modules must not only detect but also precisely
segment OoD objects, enabling targeted control actions and enhancing overall
system robustness. In this survey, we group current OoD segmentation approaches
into four categories: (i) test-time OoD segmentation, (ii) outlier exposure for
supervised training, (iii) reconstruction-based methods, (iv) and approaches
that leverage powerful models. We systematically review recent advances in OoD
segmentation for autonomous-driving scenarios, identify emerging challenges,
and discuss promising future research directions.

Conclusion: 文章总结了强化学习与生成模型结合的开放挑战和未来研究方向。

Abstract: Generative models have made significant progress in synthesizing visual
content, including images, videos, and 3D/4D structures. However, they are
typically trained with surrogate objectives such as likelihood or
reconstruction loss, which often misalign with perceptual quality, semantic
accuracy, or physical realism. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a principled
framework for optimizing non-differentiable, preference-driven, and temporally
structured objectives. Recent advances demonstrate its effectiveness in
enhancing controllability, consistency, and human alignment across generative
tasks. This survey provides a systematic overview of RL-based methods for
visual content generation. We review the evolution of RL from classical control
to its role as a general-purpose optimization tool, and examine its integration
into image, video, and 3D/4D generation. Across these domains, RL serves not
only as a fine-tuning mechanism but also as a structural component for aligning
generation with complex, high-level goals. We conclude with open challenges and
future research directions at the intersection of RL and generative modeling.

Result: 在10多个基准测试中，该方法平均提升0.9%，技能相关子集提升1.5%。

Conclusion: 强调了指令选择中概念知识与视觉技能之间的权衡重要性。

Abstract: Vision-language instruction tuning achieves two main purposes: learning
visual concepts and learning visual skills. In this paper, we found that
vision-language benchmarks fall into the dichotomy of mainly benefiting from
training on instructions with similar skills or visual concepts. Inspired by
the discovery, we designed a simple targeted training data selection method to
optimize the performance of a given benchmark. We first extract the
concepts/skills from the benchmark, determine whether the benchmark
predominantly benefits from similar concepts or skills, and finally select
instructions with the most matching concepts/skills. Experiments on 10+
benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our targeted data selection method,
showing +0.9\% over the best existing baseline averaged over all benchmarks and
+1.5\% on the skill-focused subset. Our findings underscore the importance of
recognizing the inherent trade-off within instruction selection, which requires
balancing the acquisition of conceptual knowledge against visual skill.

Motivation: 当前研究多关注单一超微结构识别，难以满足实际诊断需求，需同时量化多种特征。

Result: 在115名患者中验证，自动量化结果与病理报告一致，具备高精度和高通量。

Conclusion: Glo-DMU为肾病理学家提供了高效工具，支持全自动化、多特征同时量化。

Abstract: Complex and diverse ultrastructural features can indicate the type,
progression, and prognosis of kidney diseases. Recently, computational
pathology combined with deep learning methods has shown tremendous potential in
advancing automatic morphological analysis of glomerular ultrastructure.
However, current research predominantly focuses on the recognition of
individual ultrastructure, which makes it challenging to meet practical
diagnostic needs. In this study, we propose the glomerular morphometry
framework of ultrastructural characterization (Glo-DMU), which is grounded on
three deep models: the ultrastructure segmentation model, the glomerular
filtration barrier region classification model, and the electron-dense deposits
detection model. Following the conventional protocol of renal biopsy diagnosis,
this framework simultaneously quantifies the three most widely used
ultrastructural features: the thickness of glomerular basement membrane, the
degree of foot process effacement, and the location of electron-dense deposits.
We evaluated the 115 patients with 9 renal pathological types in real-world
diagnostic scenarios, demonstrating good consistency between automatic
quantification results and morphological descriptions in the pathological
reports. Glo-DMU possesses the characteristics of full automation, high
precision, and high throughput, quantifying multiple ultrastructural features
simultaneously, and providing an efficient tool for assisting renal
pathologists.

Conclusion: AtomDiffuser为辐射诱导的原子不稳定性相关退化模式提供了可视化和量化工具，提升了STEM数据的解释能力。

Abstract: Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) plays a critical role in
modern materials science, enabling direct imaging of atomic structures and
their evolution under external interferences. However, interpreting
time-resolved STEM data remains challenging due to two entangled degradation
effects: spatial drift caused by mechanical and thermal instabilities, and
beam-induced signal loss resulting from radiation damage. These factors distort
both geometry and intensity in complex, temporally correlated ways, making it
difficult for existing methods to explicitly separate their effects or model
material dynamics at atomic resolution. In this work, we present AtomDiffuser,
a time-aware degradation modeling framework that disentangles sample drift and
radiometric attenuation by predicting an affine transformation and a spatially
varying decay map between any two STEM frames. Unlike traditional denoising or
registration pipelines, our method leverages degradation as a physically
heuristic, temporally conditioned process, enabling interpretable structural
evolutions across time. Trained on synthetic degradation processes,
AtomDiffuser also generalizes well to real-world cryo-STEM data. It further
supports high-resolution degradation inference and drift alignment, offering
tools for visualizing and quantifying degradation patterns that correlate with
radiation-induced atomic instabilities.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving systems promise stronger performance through
unified optimization of perception, motion forecasting, and planning. However,
vision-based approaches face fundamental limitations in adverse weather
conditions, partial occlusions, and precise velocity estimation - critical
challenges in safety-sensitive scenarios where accurate motion understanding
and long-horizon trajectory prediction are essential for collision avoidance.
To address these limitations, we propose SpaRC-AD, a query-based end-to-end
camera-radar fusion framework for planning-oriented autonomous driving. Through
sparse 3D feature alignment, and doppler-based velocity estimation, we achieve
strong 3D scene representations for refinement of agent anchors, map polylines
and motion modelling. Our method achieves strong improvements over the
state-of-the-art vision-only baselines across multiple autonomous driving
tasks, including 3D detection (+4.8% mAP), multi-object tracking (+8.3% AMOTA),
online mapping (+1.8% mAP), motion prediction (-4.0% mADE), and trajectory
planning (-0.1m L2 and -9% TPC). We achieve both spatial coherence and temporal
consistency on multiple challenging benchmarks, including real-world open-loop
nuScenes, long-horizon T-nuScenes, and closed-loop simulator Bench2Drive. We
show the effectiveness of radar-based fusion in safety-critical scenarios where
accurate motion understanding and long-horizon trajectory prediction are
essential for collision avoidance. The source code of all experiments is

Abstract: Assessing the alignment of multimodal vision-language models~(VLMs) with
human perception is essential to understand how they perceive low-level visual
features. A key characteristic of human vision is the contrast sensitivity
function (CSF), which describes sensitivity to spatial frequency at
low-contrasts. Here, we introduce a novel behavioral psychophysics-inspired
method to estimate the CSF of chat-based VLMs by directly prompting them to
judge pattern visibility at different contrasts for each frequency. This
methodology is closer to the real experiments in psychophysics than the
previously reported. Using band-pass filtered noise images and a diverse set of
prompts, we assess model responses across multiple architectures. We find that
while some models approximate human-like CSF shape or magnitude, none fully
replicate both. Notably, prompt phrasing has a large effect on the responses,
raising concerns about prompt stability. Our results provide a new framework
for probing visual sensitivity in multimodal models and reveal key gaps between
their visual representations and human perception.

Motivation: 现有图像生成模型因缺乏对场景结构和空间布局的理解，常产生空间不一致和扭曲的图像。

Method: 利用预训练估计器从图像数据集中提取场景内在属性，并通过自编码器聚合为单一潜在变量；基于预训练的潜在扩散模型（LDM），同时去噪图像和内在属性域。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能纠正空间不一致性，生成更自然的场景布局，同时保持基础模型（如Stable Diffusion）的保真度和文本对齐性。

Conclusion: 通过联合生成图像和场景内在属性，模型能隐式捕捉场景结构，生成更一致和真实的图像。

Abstract: Image generation models trained on large datasets can synthesize high-quality
images but often produce spatially inconsistent and distorted images due to
limited information about the underlying structures and spatial layouts. In
this work, we leverage intrinsic scene properties (e.g., depth, segmentation
maps) that provide rich information about the underlying scene, unlike prior
approaches that solely rely on image-text pairs or use intrinsics as
conditional inputs. Our approach aims to co-generate both images and their
corresponding intrinsics, enabling the model to implicitly capture the
underlying scene structure and generate more spatially consistent and realistic
images. Specifically, we first extract rich intrinsic scene properties from a
large image dataset with pre-trained estimators, eliminating the need for
additional scene information or explicit 3D representations. We then aggregate
various intrinsic scene properties into a single latent variable using an
autoencoder. Building upon pre-trained large-scale Latent Diffusion Models
(LDMs), our method simultaneously denoises the image and intrinsic domains by
carefully sharing mutual information so that the image and intrinsic reflect
each other without degrading image quality. Experimental results demonstrate
that our method corrects spatial inconsistencies and produces a more natural
layout of scenes while maintaining the fidelity and textual alignment of the
base model (e.g., Stable Diffusion).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实数据集中的隐式标签噪声（如模糊边界和标注者差异）会损害模型性能，传统数据增强方法可能放大这些问题。

Method: NSegment+仅对标签施加弹性变形，保持原始图像不变，以学习对标签不一致的鲁棒表示。

Result: 在多个数据集（Vaihingen、LoveDA等）上平均mIoU提升显著，最高达+3.39。

Conclusion: NSegment+有效解决了隐式标签噪声问题，且与其他训练技巧结合效果更佳。

Abstract: While previous studies on image segmentation focus on handling severe (or
explicit) label noise, real-world datasets also exhibit subtle (or implicit)
label imperfections. These arise from inherent challenges, such as ambiguous
object boundaries and annotator variability. Although not explicitly present,
such mild and latent noise can still impair model performance. Typical data
augmentation methods, which apply identical transformations to the image and
its label, risk amplifying these subtle imperfections and limiting the model's
generalization capacity. In this paper, we introduce NSegment+, a novel
augmentation framework that decouples image and label transformations to
address such realistic noise for semantic segmentation. By introducing
controlled elastic deformations only to segmentation labels while preserving
the original images, our method encourages models to focus on learning robust
representations of object structures despite minor label inconsistencies.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that NSegment+ consistently improves
performance, achieving mIoU gains of up to +2.29, +2.38, +1.75, and +3.39 in
average on Vaihingen, LoveDA, Cityscapes, and PASCAL VOC, respectively-even
without bells and whistles, highlighting the importance of addressing implicit
label noise. These gains can be further amplified when combined with other
training tricks, including CutMix and Label Smoothing.

Method: 提出PQ-DAF框架，利用渐进条件扩散模型（PCDMs）生成多样训练样本，并通过基于CogVLM的样本质量评估模块过滤低质量样本。

Conclusion: PQ-DAF通过高质量数据增强和样本过滤，有效解决了驾驶员分心检测中的泛化问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Driver distraction detection is essential for improving traffic safety and
reducing road accidents. However, existing models often suffer from degraded
generalization when deployed in real-world scenarios. This limitation primarily
arises from the few-shot learning challenge caused by the high cost of data
annotation in practical environments, as well as the substantial domain shift
between training datasets and target deployment conditions. To address these
issues, we propose a Pose-driven Quality-controlled Data Augmentation Framework
(PQ-DAF) that leverages a vision-language model for sample filtering to
cost-effectively expand training data and enhance cross-domain robustness.
Specifically, we employ a Progressive Conditional Diffusion Model (PCDMs) to
accurately capture key driver pose features and synthesize diverse training
examples. A sample quality assessment module, built upon the CogVLM
vision-language model, is then introduced to filter out low-quality synthetic
samples based on a confidence threshold, ensuring the reliability of the
augmented dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PQ-DAF substantially
improves performance in few-shot driver distraction detection, achieving
significant gains in model generalization under data-scarce conditions.

### [134] [Translation of Text Embedding via Delta Vector to Suppress Strongly Entangled Content in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10407)
*Eunseo Koh,Seunghoo Hong,Tae-Young Kim,Simon S. Woo,Jae-Pil Heo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新方法，通过修改文本嵌入空间中的delta向量，抑制扩散模型中与特定词强关联的内容，并进一步优化为选择性抑制方法，显著提升了生成图像的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到图像扩散模型中特定词与内容强关联的问题，例如生成“查理·卓别林”时无法避免“胡子”的出现。

Method: 引入delta向量修改文本嵌入，提出选择性抑制方法（SSDV），优化delta向量以适应个性化模型。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在定量和定性指标上均显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效抑制了不想要的内容，提升了生成图像的精确性和多样性。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models have made significant progress in
generating diverse high-quality images from textual prompts. However, these
models still face challenges in suppressing content that is strongly entangled
with specific words. For example, when generating an image of ``Charlie
Chaplin", a ``mustache" consistently appears even if explicitly instructed not
to include it, as the concept of ``mustache" is strongly entangled with
``Charlie Chaplin". To address this issue, we propose a novel approach to
directly suppress such entangled content within the text embedding space of
diffusion models. Our method introduces a delta vector that modifies the text
embedding to weaken the influence of undesired content in the generated image,
and we further demonstrate that this delta vector can be easily obtained
through a zero-shot approach. Furthermore, we propose a Selective Suppression
with Delta Vector (SSDV) method to adapt delta vector into the cross-attention
mechanism, enabling more effective suppression of unwanted content in regions
where it would otherwise be generated. Additionally, we enabled more precise
suppression in personalized T2I models by optimizing delta vector, which
previous baselines were unable to achieve. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods, both
in terms of quantitative and qualitative metrics.

TL;DR: SC-Lane是一种新颖的3D车道检测框架，通过动态融合坡度特征和保持时间一致性，显著提升了高度估计和车道检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖固定坡度锚点，难以适应多样化的道路几何形状，SC-Lane旨在通过自适应特征融合和时间一致性提升鲁棒性。

Method: 提出Slope-Aware Adaptive Feature模块动态预测权重，融合多坡度特征；Height Consistency模块确保时间一致性。

Result: 在OpenLane基准测试中，SC-Lane以64.3%的F-score显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SC-Lane通过动态特征融合和时间一致性模块，为3D车道检测设定了新的性能标准。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce SC-Lane, a novel slope-aware and temporally
consistent heightmap estimation framework for 3D lane detection. Unlike
previous approaches that rely on fixed slope anchors, SC-Lane adaptively
determines the fusion of slope-specific height features, improving robustness
to diverse road geometries. To achieve this, we propose a Slope-Aware Adaptive
Feature module that dynamically predicts the appropriate weights from image
cues for integrating multi-slope representations into a unified heightmap.
Additionally, a Height Consistency Module enforces temporal coherence, ensuring
stable and accurate height estimation across consecutive frames, which is
crucial for real-world driving scenarios. To evaluate the effectiveness of
SC-Lane, we employ three standardized metrics-Mean Absolute Error(MAE), Root
Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and threshold-based accuracy-which, although common
in surface and depth estimation, have been underutilized for road height
assessment. Using the LiDAR-derived heightmap dataset introduced in prior work
[20], we benchmark our method under these metrics, thereby establishing a
rigorous standard for future comparisons. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane
benchmark demonstrate that SC-Lane significantly improves both height
estimation and 3D lane detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance with
an F-score of 64.3%, outperforming existing methods by a notable margin. For

TL;DR: NanoControl提出了一种高效的可控文本到图像生成方法，通过LoRA风格的控制模块和KV-Context增强机制，显著降低了计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于DiTs的可控文本到图像生成方法依赖ControlNet范式，导致参数和计算成本高。

Method: 采用Flux作为骨干网络，设计LoRA风格控制模块和KV-Context增强机制，直接学习控制信号并融合条件特征。

Result: NanoControl仅增加0.024%参数和0.029%GFLOPs，在保持生成质量的同时显著提升效率。

Conclusion: NanoControl在高效可控生成领域表现优异，为DiTs的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in
text-to-image synthesis. However, in the domain of controllable text-to-image
generation using DiTs, most existing methods still rely on the ControlNet
paradigm originally designed for UNet-based diffusion models. This paradigm
introduces significant parameter overhead and increased computational costs. To
address these challenges, we propose the Nano Control Diffusion Transformer
(NanoControl), which employs Flux as the backbone network. Our model achieves
state-of-the-art controllable text-to-image generation performance while
incurring only a 0.024\% increase in parameter count and a 0.029\% increase in
GFLOPs, thus enabling highly efficient controllable generation. Specifically,
rather than duplicating the DiT backbone for control, we design a LoRA-style
(low-rank adaptation) control module that directly learns control signals from
raw conditioning inputs. Furthermore, we introduce a KV-Context Augmentation
mechanism that integrates condition-specific key-value information into the
backbone in a simple yet highly effective manner, facilitating deep fusion of
conditional features. Extensive benchmark experiments demonstrate that
NanoControl significantly reduces computational overhead compared to
conventional control approaches, while maintaining superior generation quality
and achieving improved controllability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLMs基于静态网络图像文本对训练，缺乏对动态交通场景的精确时空推理能力。

Method: 构建STRIDE-QA数据集，包含100小时多传感器驾驶数据和1600万QA对，支持对象中心和自我中心推理任务。

Result: 微调后的VLMs在空间定位和未来运动预测中表现显著提升，分别达到55%和28%的成功率。

Conclusion: STRIDE-QA为开发更可靠的自动驾驶VLMs提供了重要基础。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been applied to autonomous driving to
support decision-making in complex real-world scenarios. However, their
training on static, web-sourced image-text pairs fundamentally limits the
precise spatiotemporal reasoning required to understand and predict dynamic
traffic scenes. We address this critical gap with STRIDE-QA, a large-scale
visual question answering (VQA) dataset for physically grounded reasoning from
an ego-centric perspective. Constructed from 100 hours of multi-sensor driving
data in Tokyo, capturing diverse and challenging conditions, STRIDE-QA is the
largest VQA dataset for spatiotemporal reasoning in urban driving, offering 16
million QA pairs over 285K frames. Grounded by dense, automatically generated
annotations including 3D bounding boxes, segmentation masks, and multi-object
tracks, the dataset uniquely supports both object-centric and ego-centric
reasoning through three novel QA tasks that require spatial localization and
temporal prediction. Our benchmarks demonstrate that existing VLMs struggle
significantly, achieving near-zero scores on prediction consistency. In
contrast, VLMs fine-tuned on STRIDE-QA exhibit dramatic performance gains,
achieving 55% success in spatial localization and 28% consistency in future
motion prediction, compared to near-zero scores from general-purpose VLMs.
Therefore, STRIDE-QA establishes a comprehensive foundation for developing more
reliable VLMs for safety-critical autonomous systems.

Motivation: 解决持续视频实例分割中实例、类别和任务的混淆问题，同时保持时间一致性。

Method: 1. 实例级学习：建模实例跟踪并构建实例相关性损失。2. 类别级学习：构建自适应残差语义提示框架。3. 任务级学习：引入增量提示初始化策略。

Result: 在YouTube-VIS数据集上显著优于现有方法，避免了灾难性遗忘，提升了分割和分类性能。

Conclusion: CRISP为持续视频实例分割提供了一种有效解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Continual video instance segmentation demands both the plasticity to absorb
new object categories and the stability to retain previously learned ones, all
while preserving temporal consistency across frames. In this work, we introduce
Contrastive Residual Injection and Semantic Prompting (CRISP), an earlier
attempt tailored to address the instance-wise, category-wise, and task-wise
confusion in continual video instance segmentation. For instance-wise learning,
we model instance tracking and construct instance correlation loss, which
emphasizes the correlation with the prior query space while strengthening the
specificity of the current task query. For category-wise learning, we build an
adaptive residual semantic prompt (ARSP) learning framework, which constructs a
learnable semantic residual prompt pool generated by category text and uses an
adjustive query-prompt matching mechanism to build a mapping relationship
between the query of the current task and the semantic residual prompt.
Meanwhile, a semantic consistency loss based on the contrastive learning is
introduced to maintain semantic coherence between object queries and residual
prompts during incremental training. For task-wise learning, to ensure the
correlation at the inter-task level within the query space, we introduce a
concise yet powerful initialization strategy for incremental prompts. Extensive
experiments on YouTube-VIS-2019 and YouTube-VIS-2021 datasets demonstrate that
CRISP significantly outperforms existing continual segmentation methods in the
long-term continual video instance segmentation task, avoiding catastrophic
forgetting and effectively improving segmentation and classification
performance. The code is available at https://github.com/01upup10/CRISP.

Motivation: 现有方法需要双模态标注，成本高；DOD-SA旨在通过单模态标注实现高效跨模态知识迁移。

Method: 采用协作师生网络（CoSD-TSNet）和渐进式自调优训练策略（PaST），结合伪标签分配器（PLA）。

Result: 在DroneVehicle数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DOD-SA有效解决了双模态标注的高成本问题，同时提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Infrared-visible object detection has shown great potential in real-world
applications, enabling robust all-day perception by leveraging the
complementary information of infrared and visible images. However, existing
methods typically require dual-modality annotations to output detection results
for both modalities during prediction, which incurs high annotation costs. To
address this challenge, we propose a novel infrared-visible Decoupled Object
Detection framework with Single-modality Annotations, called DOD-SA. The
architecture of DOD-SA is built upon a Single- and Dual-Modality Collaborative
Teacher-Student Network (CoSD-TSNet), which consists of a single-modality
branch (SM-Branch) and a dual-modality decoupled branch (DMD-Branch). The
teacher model generates pseudo-labels for the unlabeled modality,
simultaneously supporting the training of the student model. The collaborative
design enables cross-modality knowledge transfer from the labeled modality to
the unlabeled modality, and facilitates effective SM-to-DMD branch supervision.
To further improve the decoupling ability of the model and the pseudo-label
quality, we introduce a Progressive and Self-Tuning Training Strategy (PaST)
that trains the model in three stages: (1) pretraining SM-Branch, (2) guiding
the learning of DMD-Branch by SM-Branch, and (3) refining DMD-Branch. In
addition, we design a Pseudo Label Assigner (PLA) to align and pair labels
across modalities, explicitly addressing modality misalignment during training.
Extensive experiments on the DroneVehicle dataset demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA).

Conclusion: 该方法降低了依赖CAD系统和人工标注的成本，支持建筑行业的标准化和可持续发展。

Abstract: Legacy floor plans, often preserved only as scanned documents, remain
essential resources for architecture, urban planning, and facility management
in the construction industry. However, the lack of machine-readable floor plans
render large-scale interpretation both time-consuming and error-prone.
Automated symbol spotting offers a scalable solution by enabling the
identification of service key symbols directly from floor plans, supporting
workflows such as cost estimation, infrastructure maintenance, and regulatory
compliance. This work introduces a labelled Digitised Electrical Layout Plans
(DELP) dataset comprising 45 scanned electrical layout plans annotated with
2,450 instances across 34 distinct service key classes. A systematic evaluation
framework is proposed using pretrained object detection models for DELP
dataset. Among the models benchmarked, YOLOv8 achieves the highest performance
with a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 82.5\%. Using YOLOv8, we develop
SkeySpot, a lightweight, open-source toolkit for real-time detection,
classification, and quantification of electrical symbols. SkeySpot produces
structured, standardised outputs that can be scaled up for interoperable
building information workflows, ultimately enabling compatibility across
downstream applications and regulatory platforms. By lowering dependency on
proprietary CAD systems and reducing manual annotation effort, this approach
makes the digitisation of electrical layouts more accessible to small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the construction industry, while supporting
broader goals of standardisation, interoperability, and sustainability in the
built environment.

Result: V1-like层在图像失真任务中与人类感知判断高度相关，且在适度噪声、模糊和稀疏条件下表现最佳。

Conclusion: 视觉系统可能针对特定失真水平进行优化，生物启发模型可无监督学习感知度量。

Abstract: A number of scientists suggested that human visual perception may emerge from
image statistics, shaping efficient neural representations in early vision. In
this work, a bio-inspired architecture that can accommodate several known facts
in the retina-V1 cortex, the PerceptNet, has been end-to-end optimized for
different tasks related to image reconstruction: autoencoding, denoising,
deblurring, and sparsity regularization. Our results show that the encoder
stage (V1-like layer) consistently exhibits the highest correlation with human
perceptual judgments on image distortion despite not using perceptual
information in the initialization or training. This alignment exhibits an
optimum for moderate noise, blur and sparsity. These findings suggest that the
visual system may be tuned to remove those particular levels of distortion with
that level of sparsity and that biologically inspired models can learn
perceptual metrics without human supervision.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于轨迹感知移位状态空间模型（TS-Mamba）的在线视频超分辨率方法，通过长时轨迹建模和低复杂度Mamba实现高效时空信息聚合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有在线视频超分辨率方法通常仅利用相邻前一帧进行时间对齐，限制了长时建模能力。状态空间模型（SSMs）因其线性计算复杂度和全局感受野而表现出色，本文旨在结合轨迹建模和Mamba提升性能。

Method: 提出TS-Mamba方法，包括轨迹构建以选择相似标记，以及轨迹感知移位Mamba聚合（TSMA）模块。TSMA基于Hilbert扫描和移位操作设计，以补偿扫描损失并增强空间连续性。此外，提出轨迹感知损失函数监督轨迹生成。

Result: 在三个广泛使用的VSR测试数据集上，TS-Mamba在多数情况下优于六种基准模型，计算复杂度降低22.7%（以MACs计）。

Conclusion: TS-Mamba通过结合轨迹建模和Mamba，实现了高效的时空信息聚合，显著提升了在线视频超分辨率的性能与效率。

Abstract: Online video super-resolution (VSR) is an important technique for many
real-world video processing applications, which aims to restore the current
high-resolution video frame based on temporally previous frames. Most of the
existing online VSR methods solely employ one neighboring previous frame to
achieve temporal alignment, which limits long-range temporal modeling of
videos. Recently, state space models (SSMs) have been proposed with linear
computational complexity and a global receptive field, which significantly
improve computational efficiency and performance. In this context, this paper
presents a novel online VSR method based on Trajectory-aware Shifted SSMs
(TS-Mamba), leveraging both long-term trajectory modeling and low-complexity
Mamba to achieve efficient spatio-temporal information aggregation.
Specifically, TS-Mamba first constructs the trajectories within a video to
select the most similar tokens from the previous frames. Then, a
Trajectory-aware Shifted Mamba Aggregation (TSMA) module consisting of proposed
shifted SSMs blocks is employed to aggregate the selected tokens. The shifted
SSMs blocks are designed based on Hilbert scannings and corresponding shift
operations to compensate for scanning losses and strengthen the spatial
continuity of Mamba. Additionally, we propose a trajectory-aware loss function
to supervise the trajectory generation, ensuring the accuracy of token
selection when training our model. Extensive experiments on three widely used
VSR test datasets demonstrate that compared with six online VSR benchmark
models, our TS-Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance in most cases and
over 22.7\% complexity reduction (in MACs). The source code for TS-Mamba will
be available at https://github.com.

multi-scale tiling to capture plants at different scales, dynamic threshold

Motivation: 解决深度学习分割对标注数据的依赖问题，尤其是在脑MRI等体积图像中标注成本高的问题。

Conclusion: 领域随机化与AE质量控制的结合为极有限标注数据的半监督分割提供了有效策略，减轻标注负担。

Abstract: Deep learning segmentation relies heavily on labeled data, but manual
labeling is laborious and time-consuming, especially for volumetric images such
as brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). While recent domain-randomization
techniques alleviate the dependency on labeled data by synthesizing diverse
training images from label maps, they offer limited anatomical variability when
very few label maps are available. Semi-supervised self-training addresses
label scarcity by iteratively incorporating model predictions into the training
set, enabling networks to learn from unlabeled data. In this work, we combine
domain randomization with self-training to train three-dimensional
skull-stripping networks using as little as a single labeled example. First, we
automatically bin voxel intensities, yielding labels we use to synthesize
images for training an initial skull-stripping model. Second, we train a
convolutional autoencoder (AE) on the labeled example and use its
reconstruction error to assess the quality of brain masks predicted for
unlabeled data. Third, we select the top-ranking pseudo-labels to fine-tune the
network, achieving skull-stripping performance on out-of-distribution data that
approaches models trained with more labeled images. We compare AE-based ranking
to consistency-based ranking under test-time augmentation, finding that the AE
approach yields a stronger correlation with segmentation accuracy. Our results
highlight the potential of combining domain randomization and AE-based quality
control to enable effective semi-supervised segmentation from extremely limited
labeled data. This strategy may ease the labeling burden that slows progress in
studies involving new anatomical structures or emerging imaging techniques.

Conclusion: 综合评估和改进方法为毫米波雷达HAR系统的优化提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Human Action Recognition (HAR) plays a crucial role in healthcare, fitness
tracking, and ambient assisted living technologies. While traditional vision
based HAR systems are effective, they pose privacy concerns. mmWave radar
sensors offer a privacy preserving alternative but present challenges due to
the sparse and noisy nature of their point cloud data. In the literature, three
primary data processing methods: Density-Based Spatial Clustering of
Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), the Hungarian Algorithm, and Kalman Filtering
have been widely used to improve the quality and continuity of radar data.
However, a comprehensive evaluation of these methods, both individually and in
combination, remains lacking. This paper addresses that gap by conducting a
detailed performance analysis of the three methods using the MiliPoint dataset.
We evaluate each method individually, all possible pairwise combinations, and
the combination of all three, assessing both recognition accuracy and
computational cost. Furthermore, we propose targeted enhancements to the
individual methods aimed at improving accuracy. Our results provide crucial
insights into the strengths and trade-offs of each method and their
integrations, guiding future work on mmWave based HAR systems

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: STAS是肺腺癌中的一种新型侵袭模式，与肿瘤复发和生存率下降相关，但其诊断因病理特征复杂而容易出错，亟需自动化解决方案。

Method: 研究收集了多中心的STAS患者病理图像，构建了三个数据集，并开发了STAMP框架，结合双分支架构、Transformer编码和多模式注意力模块来优化诊断。

Result: STAMP在三个数据集上的AUC分别为0.8058、0.8017和0.7928，超越了临床诊断水平。

Conclusion: STAMP框架通过深度学习显著提升了STAS的诊断准确性，为临床提供了高效工具。

Abstract: Spread through air spaces (STAS) constitutes a novel invasive pattern in lung
adenocarcinoma (LUAD), associated with tumor recurrence and diminished survival
rates. However, large-scale STAS diagnosis in LUAD remains a labor-intensive
endeavor, compounded by the propensity for oversight and misdiagnosis due to
its distinctive pathological characteristics and morphological features.
Consequently, there is a pressing clinical imperative to leverage deep learning
models for STAS diagnosis. This study initially assembled histopathological
images from STAS patients at the Second Xiangya Hospital and the Third Xiangya
Hospital of Central South University, alongside the TCGA-LUAD cohort. Three
senior pathologists conducted cross-verification annotations to construct the
STAS-SXY, STAS-TXY, and STAS-TCGA datasets. We then propose a multi-pattern
attention-aware multiple instance learning framework, named STAMP, to analyze
and diagnose the presence of STAS across multi-center histopathology images.
Specifically, the dual-branch architecture guides the model to learn
STAS-associated pathological features from distinct semantic spaces.
Transformer-based instance encoding and a multi-pattern attention aggregation
modules dynamically selects regions closely associated with STAS pathology,
suppressing irrelevant noise and enhancing the discriminative power of global
representations. Moreover, a similarity regularization constraint prevents

*Jianda Mao,Kaibo Wang,Yang Xiang,Kani Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TweezeEdit是一种无需调优和反演的图像编辑框架，通过正则化整个去噪路径而非依赖反演锚点，实现高效且语义保留的编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在文本引导的图像编辑中过度对齐目标提示而忽略源图像语义保留，且编辑路径长效率低。

Method: 提出TweezeEdit，利用梯度驱动正则化在一致性模型上直接注入目标提示语义，缩短编辑路径。

Result: 实验表明TweezeEdit在语义保留和目标对齐上优于现有方法，仅需12步（1.6秒/次）。

Conclusion: TweezeEdit高效且语义保留能力强，适合实时应用。

Abstract: Large-scale pre-trained diffusion models empower users to edit images through
text guidance. However, existing methods often over-align with target prompts
while inadequately preserving source image semantics. Such approaches generate
target images explicitly or implicitly from the inversion noise of the source
images, termed the inversion anchors. We identify this strategy as suboptimal
for semantic preservation and inefficient due to elongated editing paths. We
propose TweezeEdit, a tuning- and inversion-free framework for consistent and
efficient image editing. Our method addresses these limitations by regularizing
the entire denoising path rather than relying solely on the inversion anchors,
ensuring source semantic retention and shortening editing paths. Guided by
gradient-driven regularization, we efficiently inject target prompt semantics
along a direct path using a consistency model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate TweezeEdit's superior performance in semantic preservation and
target alignment, outperforming existing methods. Remarkably, it requires only
12 steps (1.6 seconds per edit), underscoring its potential for real-time
applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合多重采样抗锯齿（MSAA）和双重几何约束的优化框架，显著提升了3D高斯泼溅在细节重建上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D高斯泼溅技术在优化过程中缺乏足够的几何约束，导致高频纹理和锐利不连续区域的模糊重建。

Method: 通过自适应混合四重子样本计算像素颜色，并引入动态梯度分析的权重策略和梯度差分约束。

Result: 在多个基准测试中实现了最先进的细节保留性能，同时保持实时渲染效率。

Conclusion: 该方法在结构相似性和感知质量上均显著优于基线方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian splatting have significantly improved
real-time novel view synthesis, yet insufficient geometric constraints during
scene optimization often result in blurred reconstructions of fine-grained
details, particularly in regions with high-frequency textures and sharp
discontinuities. To address this, we propose a comprehensive optimization
framework integrating multisample anti-aliasing (MSAA) with dual geometric
constraints. Our system computes pixel colors through adaptive blending of
quadruple subsamples, effectively reducing aliasing artifacts in high-frequency
components. The framework introduces two constraints: (a) an adaptive weighting
strategy that prioritizes under-reconstructed regions through dynamic gradient
analysis, and (b) gradient differential constraints enforcing geometric
regularization at object boundaries. This targeted optimization enables the
model to allocate computational resources preferentially to critical regions
requiring refinement while maintaining global consistency. Extensive
experimental evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance in detail preservation, particularly in
preserving high-frequency textures and sharp discontinuities, while maintaining
real-time rendering efficiency. Quantitative metrics and perceptual studies
confirm statistically significant improvements over baseline approaches in both
structural similarity (SSIM) and perceptual quality (LPIPS).

Abstract: Bolt defect detection is critical to ensure the safety of transmission lines.
However, the scarcity of defect images and imbalanced data distributions
significantly limit detection performance. To address this problem, we propose
a segmentationdriven bolt defect editing method (SBDE) to augment the dataset.
First, a bolt attribute segmentation model (Bolt-SAM) is proposed, which
enhances the segmentation of complex bolt attributes through the CLAHE-FFT
Adapter (CFA) and Multipart- Aware Mask Decoder (MAMD), generating high-quality
masks for subsequent editing tasks. Second, a mask optimization module (MOD) is
designed and integrated with the image inpainting model (LaMa) to construct the
bolt defect attribute editing model (MOD-LaMa), which converts normal bolts
into defective ones through attribute editing. Finally, an editing recovery
augmentation (ERA) strategy is proposed to recover and put the edited defect
bolts back into the original inspection scenes and expand the defect detection
dataset. We constructed multiple bolt datasets and conducted extensive
experiments. Experimental results demonstrate that the bolt defect images
generated by SBDE significantly outperform state-of-the-art image editing
models, and effectively improve the performance of bolt defect detection, which
fully verifies the effectiveness and application potential of the proposed
method. The code of the project is available at

Abstract: Estimating human dance motion is a challenging task with various industrial
applications. Recently, many efforts have focused on predicting human dance
motion using either egocentric video or music as input. However, the task of
jointly estimating human motion from both egocentric video and music remains
largely unexplored. In this paper, we aim to develop a new method that predicts
human dance motion from both egocentric video and music. In practice, the
egocentric view often obscures much of the body, making accurate full-pose
estimation challenging. Additionally, incorporating music requires the
generated head and body movements to align well with both visual and musical
inputs. We first introduce EgoAIST++, a new large-scale dataset that combines
both egocentric views and music with more than 36 hours of dancing motion.
Drawing on the success of diffusion models and Mamba on modeling sequences, we
develop an EgoMusic Motion Network with a core Skeleton Mamba that explicitly
captures the skeleton structure of the human body. We illustrate that our
approach is theoretically supportive. Intensive experiments show that our
method clearly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and generalizes
effectively to real-world data.

Abstract: Visual reasoning is critical for a wide range of computer vision tasks that
go beyond surface-level object detection and classification. Despite notable
advances in relational, symbolic, temporal, causal, and commonsense reasoning,
existing surveys often address these directions in isolation, lacking a unified
analysis and comparison across reasoning types, methodologies, and evaluation
protocols. This survey aims to address this gap by categorizing visual
reasoning into five major types (relational, symbolic, temporal, causal, and
commonsense) and systematically examining their implementation through
architectures such as graph-based models, memory networks, attention
mechanisms, and neuro-symbolic systems. We review evaluation protocols designed
to assess functional correctness, structural consistency, and causal validity,
and critically analyze their limitations in terms of generalizability,
reproducibility, and explanatory power. Beyond evaluation, we identify key open
challenges in visual reasoning, including scalability to complex scenes, deeper
integration of symbolic and neural paradigms, the lack of comprehensive
benchmark datasets, and reasoning under weak supervision. Finally, we outline a
forward-looking research agenda for next-generation vision systems, emphasizing
that bridging perception and reasoning is essential for building transparent,
trustworthy, and cross-domain adaptive AI systems, particularly in critical
domains such as autonomous driving and medical diagnostics.

Conclusion: Med-GLIP和Med-GLIP-5M为医学图像定位提供了统一且可推广的解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Medical image grounding aims to align natural language phrases with specific
regions in medical images, serving as a foundational task for intelligent
diagnosis, visual question answering (VQA), and automated report generation
(MRG). However, existing research is constrained by limited modality coverage,
coarse-grained annotations, and the absence of a unified, generalizable
grounding framework. To address these challenges, we construct a large-scale
medical grounding dataset Med-GLIP-5M comprising over 5.3 million region-level
annotations across seven imaging modalities, covering diverse anatomical
structures and pathological findings. The dataset supports both segmentation
and grounding tasks with hierarchical region labels, ranging from organ-level
boundaries to fine-grained lesions. Based on this foundation, we propose
Med-GLIP, a modality-aware grounding framework trained on Med-GLIP-5M. Rather
than relying on explicitly designed expert modules, Med-GLIP implicitly
acquires hierarchical semantic understanding from diverse training data --
enabling it to recognize multi-granularity structures, such as distinguishing
lungs from pneumonia lesions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Med-GLIP
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple grounding
benchmarks. Furthermore, integrating its spatial outputs into downstream tasks,
including medical VQA and report generation, leads to substantial performance
gains. Our dataset will be released soon.

Conclusion: GCRPNet通过创新的图增强和注意力机制，有效解决了ORSIs中的SOD问题，具有显著优势。

Abstract: Salient object detection (SOD) in optical remote sensing images (ORSIs) faces
numerous challenges, including significant variations in target scales and low
contrast between targets and the background. Existing methods based on vision
transformers (ViTs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) architectures aim
to leverage both global and local features, but the difficulty in effectively
integrating these heterogeneous features limits their overall performance. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a graph-enhanced contextual and regional
perception network (GCRPNet), which builds upon the Mamba architecture to
simultaneously capture long-range dependencies and enhance regional feature
representation. Specifically, we employ the visual state space (VSS) encoder to
extract multi-scale features. To further achieve deep guidance and enhancement
of these features, we first design a difference-similarity guided hierarchical
graph attention module (DS-HGAM). This module strengthens cross-layer
interaction capabilities between features of different scales while enhancing
the model's structural perception,allowing it to distinguish between foreground
and background more effectively. Then, we design the LEVSS block as the decoder
of GCRPNet. This module integrates our proposed adaptive scanning strategy and
multi-granularity collaborative attention enhancement module (MCAEM). It
performs adaptive patch scanning on feature maps processed via multi-scale
convolutions, thereby capturing rich local region information and enhancing
Mamba's local modeling capability. Extensive experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating its
effectiveness and superiority.

Conclusion: PSScreen有效解决了多数据集训练中的挑战，显著提升了视网膜疾病筛查的性能。

Abstract: Leveraging multiple partially labeled datasets to train a model for multiple
retinal disease screening reduces the reliance on fully annotated datasets, but
remains challenging due to significant domain shifts across training datasets
from various medical sites, and the label absent issue for partial classes. To
solve these challenges, we propose PSScreen, a novel Partially Supervised
multiple retinal disease Screening model. Our PSScreen consists of two streams
and one learns deterministic features and the other learns probabilistic
features via uncertainty injection. Then, we leverage the textual guidance to
decouple two types of features into disease-wise features and align them via
feature distillation to boost the domain generalization ability. Meanwhile, we
employ pseudo label consistency between two streams to address the label absent
issue and introduce a self-distillation to transfer task-relevant semantics
about known classes from the deterministic to the probabilistic stream to
further enhance the detection performances. Experiments show that our PSScreen
significantly enhances the detection performances on six retinal diseases and
the normal state averagely and achieves state-of-the-art results on both
in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. Codes are available at

Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) surgical navigation systems are emerging as the next
generation of intraoperative surgical guidance, promising to overcome
limitations of traditional navigation systems. However, known issues with AR
depth perception due to vergence-accommodation conflict and occlusion handling
limitations of the currently commercially available display technology present
acute challenges in surgical settings where precision is paramount. This study
presents a novel methodology for utilizing AR guidance to register anatomical
targets and provide real-time instrument navigation using placement of
simulated external ventricular drain catheters on a phantom model as the
clinical scenario. The system registers target positions to the patient through
a novel surface tracing method and uses real-time infrared tool tracking to aid
in catheter placement, relying only on the onboard sensors of the Microsoft
HoloLens 2. A group of intended users performed the procedure of simulated
insertions under two AR guidance conditions: static in-situ visualization,
where planned trajectories are overlaid directly onto the patient anatomy, and
real-time tool-tracking guidance, where live feedback of the catheter's pose is
provided relative to the plan. Following the insertion tests, computed
tomography scans of the phantom models were acquired, allowing for evaluation
of insertion accuracy, target deviation, angular error, and depth precision.
System Usability Scale surveys assessed user experience and cognitive workload.
Tool-tracking guidance improved performance metrics across all accuracy
measures and was preferred by users in subjective evaluations. A free copy of

Result: 在ImageNet-1k数据集上，RAP将FPR95降低了7.05%，AUROC提高了1.71%。

Conclusion: RAP通过检索增强的提示实现了先进的OOD检测性能，并通过实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for the reliable deployment of
machine learning models in-the-wild, enabling accurate identification of test
samples that differ from the training data distribution. Existing methods rely
on auxiliary outlier samples or in-distribution (ID) data to generate outlier
information for training, but due to limited outliers and their mismatch with
real test OOD samples, they often fail to provide sufficient semantic
supervision, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a
novel OOD detection method called Retrieval-Augmented Prompt (RAP). RAP
augments a pre-trained vision-language model's prompts by retrieving external
knowledge, offering enhanced semantic supervision for OOD detection. During
training, RAP retrieves descriptive words for outliers based on joint
similarity with external textual knowledge and uses them to augment the model's
OOD prompts. During testing, RAP dynamically updates OOD prompts in real-time
based on the encountered OOD samples, enabling the model to rapidly adapt to
the test environment. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that RAP achieves
state-of-the-art performance on large-scale OOD detection benchmarks. For
example, in 1-shot OOD detection on the ImageNet-1k dataset, RAP reduces the
average FPR95 by 7.05% and improves the AUROC by 1.71% compared to previous
methods. Additionally, comprehensive ablation studies validate the
effectiveness of each module and the underlying motivations of our approach.

Result: 在多种3D感知任务中表现优于QAT基线，量化精度提升且计算效率更高。

Conclusion: PTQAT是一种通用高效的量化方法，适用于多种模型架构和量化位宽。

Abstract: Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) and Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)
represent two mainstream model quantization approaches. However, PTQ often
leads to unacceptable performance degradation in quantized models, while QAT
imposes substantial GPU memory requirements and extended training time due to
weight fine-tuning.In this paper, we propose PTQAT, a novel general hybrid
quantization algorithm for the efficient deployment of 3D perception networks.
To address the speed accuracy trade-off between PTQ and QAT, our method selects
critical layers for QAT fine-tuning and performs PTQ on the remaining layers.
Contrary to intuition, fine-tuning the layers with smaller output discrepancies
before and after quantization, rather than those with larger discrepancies,
actually leads to greater improvements in the model's quantization accuracy.
This means we better compensate for quantization errors during their
propagation, rather than addressing them at the point where they occur. The
proposed PTQAT achieves similar performance to QAT with more efficiency by
freezing nearly 50% of quantifiable layers. Additionally, PTQAT is a universal
quantization method that supports various quantization bit widths (4 bits) as
well as different model architectures, including CNNs and Transformers. The
experimental results on nuScenes across diverse 3D perception tasks, including
object detection, semantic segmentation, and occupancy prediction, show that
our method consistently outperforms QAT-only baselines. Notably, it achieves
0.2%-0.9% NDS and 0.3%-1.0% mAP gains in object detection, 0.3%-2.0% mIoU gains
in semantic segmentation and occupancy prediction while fine-tuning fewer
weights.

Conclusion: HM-Talker通过混合运动表示和身份无关学习，显著提升了说话头视频的生成效果。

Abstract: Audio-driven talking head video generation enhances user engagement in
human-computer interaction. However, current methods frequently produce videos
with motion blur and lip jitter, primarily due to their reliance on implicit
modeling of audio-facial motion correlations--an approach lacking explicit
articulatory priors (i.e., anatomical guidance for speech-related facial
movements). To overcome this limitation, we propose HM-Talker, a novel
framework for generating high-fidelity, temporally coherent talking heads.
HM-Talker leverages a hybrid motion representation combining both implicit and
explicit motion cues. Explicit cues use Action Units (AUs), anatomically
defined facial muscle movements, alongside implicit features to minimize
phoneme-viseme misalignment. Specifically, our Cross-Modal Disentanglement
Module (CMDM) extracts complementary implicit/explicit motion features while
predicting AUs directly from audio input aligned to visual cues. To mitigate
identity-dependent biases in explicit features and enhance cross-subject
generalization, we introduce the Hybrid Motion Modeling Module (HMMM). This
module dynamically merges randomly paired implicit/explicit features, enforcing
identity-agnostic learning. Together, these components enable robust lip
synchronization across diverse identities, advancing personalized talking head
synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate HM-Talker's superiority over
state-of-the-art methods in visual quality and lip-sync accuracy.

Abstract: Referring-based Video Object Segmentation is a multimodal problem that
requires producing fine-grained segmentation results guided by external cues.
Traditional approaches to this task typically involve training specialized
models, which come with high computational complexity and manual annotation
effort. Recent advances in vision-language foundation models open a promising
direction toward training-free approaches. Several studies have explored
leveraging these general-purpose models for fine-grained segmentation,
achieving performance comparable to that of fully supervised, task-specific
models. However, existing methods rely on fixed pipelines that lack the
flexibility needed to adapt to the dynamic nature of the task. To address this
limitation, we propose Multi-Modal Agent, a novel agentic system designed to
solve this task in a more flexible and adaptive manner. Specifically, our
method leverages the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to
generate dynamic workflows tailored to each input. This adaptive procedure
iteratively interacts with a set of specialized tools designed for low-level
tasks across different modalities to identify the target object described by
the multimodal cues. Our agentic approach demonstrates clear improvements over
prior methods on two multimodal-conditioned VOS tasks: RVOS and Ref-AVS.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show immense promise for
achieving truly human-like interactions, progress is hindered by the lack of
fine-grained evaluation frameworks for human-centered scenarios, encompassing
both the understanding of complex human intentions and the provision of
empathetic, context-aware responses. Here we introduce HumanSense, a
comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the human-centered perception and
interaction capabilities of MLLMs, with a particular focus on deep
understanding of extended multimodal contexts and the formulation of rational
feedback. Our evaluation reveals that leading MLLMs still have considerable
room for improvement, particularly for advanced interaction-oriented tasks.
Supplementing visual input with audio and text information yields substantial
improvements, and Omni-modal models show advantages on these tasks.
Furthermore, we argue that appropriate feedback stems from a contextual
analysis of the interlocutor's needs and emotions, with reasoning ability
serving as the key to unlocking it. Accordingly, we employ a multi-stage,
modality-progressive reinforcement learning to enhance the reasoning abilities
of an Omni model, achieving substantial gains on evaluation results.
Additionally, we observe that successful reasoning processes exhibit highly
consistent thought patterns. By designing corresponding prompts, we also
enhance the performance of non-reasoning models in a training-free manner.

TL;DR: EvTurb是一种利用事件流解耦模糊和倾斜效应的湍流去除框架，通过两步事件引导网络和真实数据集TurbEvent，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大气湍流导致的图像模糊和几何倾斜变形对计算机视觉任务构成挑战，现有方法难以解决其高度不适定性。

Method: 提出EvTurb框架，通过事件积分减少模糊，利用事件流方差图消除倾斜变形。

Result: 实验表明EvTurb在计算效率下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: EvTurb有效解决了湍流导致的图像失真问题，并提供了首个真实数据集TurbEvent。

Abstract: Atmospheric turbulence degrades image quality by introducing blur and
geometric tilt distortions, posing significant challenges to downstream
computer vision tasks. Existing single-image and multi-frame methods struggle
with the highly ill-posed nature of this problem due to the compositional
complexity of turbulence-induced distortions. To address this, we propose
EvTurb, an event guided turbulence removal framework that leverages high-speed
event streams to decouple blur and tilt effects. EvTurb decouples blur and tilt
effects by modeling event-based turbulence formation, specifically through a
novel two-step event-guided network: event integrals are first employed to
reduce blur in the coarse outputs. This is followed by employing a variance
map, derived from raw event streams, to eliminate the tilt distortion for the
refined outputs. Additionally, we present TurbEvent, the first real-captured
dataset featuring diverse turbulence scenarios. Experimental results
demonstrate that EvTurb surpasses state-of-the-art methods while maintaining
computational efficiency.

TL;DR: 论文提出P$^3$A框架，针对自动驾驶中的2D目标检测，优化高分辨率数据集的对抗性补丁攻击，引入新指标PASR和改进的损失函数LCSL，提升攻击效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有黑盒攻击方法在自动驾驶场景中因评价指标和低分辨率数据限制，攻击效果被高估，实际成功率低。

Method: 提出PASR指标和LCSL损失函数，结合PSPP数据预处理，优化高分辨率数据集的攻击效果。

Result: P$^3$A在未见模型和高分辨率数据集上优于现有攻击方法。

Conclusion: P$^3$A框架显著提升对抗性补丁攻击的实用性和效果。

Abstract: Learning-based autonomous driving systems remain critically vulnerable to
adversarial patches, posing serious safety and security risks in their
real-world deployment. Black-box attacks, notable for their high attack success
rate without model knowledge, are especially concerning, with their
transferability extensively studied to reduce computational costs compared to
query-based attacks. Previous transferability-based black-box attacks typically
adopt mean Average Precision (mAP) as the evaluation metric and design training
loss accordingly. However, due to the presence of multiple detected bounding
boxes and the relatively lenient Intersection over Union (IoU) thresholds, the
attack effectiveness of these approaches is often overestimated, resulting in
reduced success rates in practical attacking scenarios. Furthermore, patches
trained on low-resolution data often fail to maintain effectiveness on
high-resolution images, limiting their transferability to autonomous driving
datasets. To fill this gap, we propose P$^3$A, a Powerful and Practical Patch
Attack framework for 2D object detection in autonomous driving, specifically
optimized for high-resolution datasets. First, we introduce a novel metric,
Practical Attack Success Rate (PASR), to more accurately quantify attack
effectiveness with greater relevance for pedestrian safety. Second, we present
a tailored Localization-Confidence Suppression Loss (LCSL) to improve attack
transferability under PASR. Finally, to maintain the transferability for
high-resolution datasets, we further incorporate the Probabilistic
Scale-Preserving Padding (PSPP) into the patch attack pipeline as a data
preprocessing step. Extensive experiments show that P$^3$A outperforms
state-of-the-art attacks on unseen models and unseen high-resolution datasets,
both under the proposed practical IoU-based evaluation metric and the previous
mAP-based metrics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级上采样模块FGA，通过频率引导注意力改善单图像超分辨率中的高频细节重建和抗锯齿效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统上采样方法（如子像素卷积）效率高但难以重建高频细节并易引入锯齿伪影。

Method: FGA结合了基于傅里叶特征的多层感知机、跨分辨率相关注意力层和频域L1损失，以提升性能。

Result: 实验显示FGA在五种超分辨率骨干网络上平均PSNR提升0.12~0.14 dB，频域一致性提升29%。

Conclusion: FGA在减少锯齿和保留细节方面表现优异，是传统上采样方法的实用替代方案。

Abstract: We propose Frequency-Guided Attention (FGA), a lightweight upsampling module
for single image super-resolution. Conventional upsamplers, such as Sub-Pixel
Convolution, are efficient but frequently fail to reconstruct high-frequency
details and introduce aliasing artifacts. FGA addresses these issues by
integrating (1) a Fourier feature-based Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for
positional frequency encoding, (2) a cross-resolution Correlation Attention
Layer for adaptive spatial alignment, and (3) a frequency-domain L1 loss for
spectral fidelity supervision. Adding merely 0.3M parameters, FGA consistently
enhances performance across five diverse super-resolution backbones in both
lightweight and full-capacity scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate
average PSNR gains of 0.12~0.14 dB and improved frequency-domain consistency by
up to 29%, particularly evident on texture-rich datasets. Visual and spectral
evaluations confirm FGA's effectiveness in reducing aliasing and preserving
fine details, establishing it as a practical, scalable alternative to
traditional upsampling methods.

TL;DR: FIND-Net是一种新型金属伪影减少（MAR）框架，结合频域和空间域处理，显著减少伪影并保留结构细节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金属植入物在CT成像中产生的高密度伪影严重影响图像质量，现有深度学习方法在抑制伪影和保留结构细节方面表现不足。

Method: FIND-Net采用快速傅里叶卷积（FFC）层和可训练高斯滤波，将MAR任务视为频域和空间域的混合任务。

Result: 实验表明，FIND-Net在合成数据集上优于现有MAR方法，MAE降低3.07%，SSIM提高0.18%，PSNR提升0.90%。临床CT扫描验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: FIND-Net在MAR任务中表现出色，具有更好的结构保留能力和临床适用性。

Abstract: Metal artifacts, caused by high-density metallic implants in computed
tomography (CT) imaging, severely degrade image quality, complicating diagnosis
and treatment planning. While existing deep learning algorithms have achieved
notable success in Metal Artifact Reduction (MAR), they often struggle to
suppress artifacts while preserving structural details. To address this
challenge, we propose FIND-Net (Fourier-Integrated Network with Dictionary
Kernels), a novel MAR framework that integrates frequency and spatial domain
processing to achieve superior artifact suppression and structural
preservation. FIND-Net incorporates Fast Fourier Convolution (FFC) layers and
trainable Gaussian filtering, treating MAR as a hybrid task operating in both
spatial and frequency domains. This approach enhances global contextual
understanding and frequency selectivity, effectively reducing artifacts while
maintaining anatomical structures. Experiments on synthetic datasets show that
FIND-Net achieves statistically significant improvements over state-of-the-art
MAR methods, with a 3.07% MAE reduction, 0.18% SSIM increase, and 0.90% PSNR
improvement, confirming robustness across varying artifact complexities.
Furthermore, evaluations on real-world clinical CT scans confirm FIND-Net's
ability to minimize modifications to clean anatomical regions while effectively
suppressing metal-induced distortions. These findings highlight FIND-Net's
potential for advancing MAR performance, offering superior structural
preservation and improved clinical applicability. Code is available at

TL;DR: Chamfer Guidance是一种无需训练的引导方法，利用少量真实样本提升生成数据的多样性和质量，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决生成模型在追求质量时牺牲多样性的问题，同时考虑合成与真实数据间的分布偏移。

Method: 提出Chamfer Guidance，利用少量真实样本指导生成过程，优化多样性和质量。

Result: 在ImageNet-1k和多样性基准测试中表现优异，仅需2张真实样本即可达到96.4%精度和86.4%覆盖率。

Conclusion: Chamfer Guidance显著提升生成数据的实用性，且计算效率高，适用于下游任务。

Abstract: Conditional image generative models hold considerable promise to produce
infinite amounts of synthetic training data. Yet, recent progress in generation
quality has come at the expense of generation diversity, limiting the utility
of these models as a source of synthetic training data. Although guidance-based
approaches have been introduced to improve the utility of generated data by
focusing on quality or diversity, the (implicit or explicit) utility functions
oftentimes disregard the potential distribution shift between synthetic and
real data. In this work, we introduce Chamfer Guidance: a training-free
guidance approach which leverages a handful of real exemplar images to
characterize the quality and diversity of synthetic data. We show that by
leveraging the proposed Chamfer Guidance, we can boost the diversity of the
generations w.r.t. a dataset of real images while maintaining or improving the
generation quality on ImageNet-1k and standard geo-diversity benchmarks. Our
approach achieves state-of-the-art few-shot performance with as little as 2
exemplar real images, obtaining 96.4\% in terms of precision, and 86.4\% in
terms of distributional coverage, which increase to 97.5\% and 92.7\%,
respectively, when using 32 real images. We showcase the benefits of the
Chamfer Guidance generation by training downstream image classifiers on
synthetic data, achieving accuracy boost of up to 15\% for in-distribution over
the baselines, and up to 16\% in out-of-distribution. Furthermore, our approach
does not require using the unconditional model, and thus obtains a 31\%
reduction in FLOPs w.r.t. classifier-free-guidance-based approaches at sampling
time.

TL;DR: ChatENV是一种交互式视觉语言模型，结合卫星图像对和传感器数据，用于环境监测和推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型忽视环境传感器信号，依赖单一来源的标注，缺乏交互式推理能力。ChatENV旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 构建包含177k图像和152k时间对的多样化数据集，使用GPT-4o和Gemini 2.0标注，并通过LoRA适配器微调Qwen-2.5-VL模型。

Result: ChatENV在时间推理和假设推理中表现优异（BERT-F1 0.903），优于现有时间模型，并支持交互式分析。

Conclusion: ChatENV是一个强大的工具，可用于基于传感器的环境监测和推理。

Abstract: Understanding environmental changes from aerial imagery is vital for climate
resilience, urban planning, and ecosystem monitoring. Yet, current vision
language models (VLMs) overlook causal signals from environmental sensors, rely
on single-source captions prone to stylistic bias, and lack interactive
scenario-based reasoning. We present ChatENV, the first interactive VLM that
jointly reasons over satellite image pairs and real-world sensor data. Our
framework: (i) creates a 177k-image dataset forming 152k temporal pairs across
62 land-use classes in 197 countries with rich sensor metadata (e.g.,
temperature, PM10, CO); (ii) annotates data using GPT- 4o and Gemini 2.0 for
stylistic and semantic diversity; and (iii) fine-tunes Qwen-2.5-VL using
efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) adapters for chat purposes. ChatENV
achieves strong performance in temporal and "what-if" reasoning (e.g., BERT-F1
0.903) and rivals or outperforms state-of-the-art temporal models, while
supporting interactive scenario-based analysis. This positions ChatENV as a
powerful tool for grounded, sensor-aware environmental monitoring.

Method: 分析图像采集过程中的参数和细微变换，研究其在视觉表示中的编码方式及其对预测的影响。

Result: 发现这些参数和变换会被编码到视觉表示中，且对语义预测有显著影响，具体效果取决于其与语义标签的相关性。

Conclusion: 图像采集参数和细微变换对视觉编码器的语义预测具有重要影响，需在模型设计中加以考虑。

Abstract: Prior work has analyzed the robustness of visual encoders to image
transformations and corruptions, particularly in cases where such alterations
are not seen during training. When this occurs, they introduce a form of
distribution shift at test time, often leading to performance degradation. The
primary focus has been on severe corruptions that, when applied aggressively,
distort useful signals necessary for accurate semantic predictions.
  We take a different perspective by analyzing parameters of the image
acquisition process and transformations that may be subtle or even
imperceptible to the human eye. We find that such parameters are systematically
encoded in the learned visual representations and can be easily recovered. More
strikingly, their presence can have a profound impact, either positively or
negatively, on semantic predictions. This effect depends on whether there is a
strong correlation or anti-correlation between semantic labels and these
acquisition-based or processing-based labels. Our code and data are available

Motivation: 传统跛行检测方法依赖手动设计的运动特征，效率低且精度有限。本研究旨在通过自动学习运动特征，提高检测效率和准确性。

Method: 使用T-LEAP姿态估计模型从行走奶牛视频中提取9个关键点的运动轨迹，并将其输入BLSTM分类器进行二元跛行分类。

Result: 最佳架构的分类准确率达85%，优于传统方法的80%，且仅需1秒视频数据即可检测跛行。

Conclusion: 结合姿态估计和BLSTM的方法在跛行检测中表现出色，适用于短序列和小数据集。

Abstract: This study presents a lameness detection approach that combines pose
estimation and Bidirectional Long-Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) neural networks.
Combining pose-estimation and BLSTMs classifier offers the following
advantages: markerless pose-estimation, elimination of manual feature
engineering by learning temporal motion features from the keypoint
trajectories, and working with short sequences and small training datasets.
Motion sequences of nine keypoints (located on the cows' hooves, head and back)
were extracted from videos of walking cows with the T-LEAP pose estimation
model. The trajectories of the keypoints were then used as an input to a BLSTM
classifier that was trained to perform binary lameness classification. Our
method significantly outperformed an established method that relied on
manually-designed locomotion features: our best architecture achieved a
classification accuracy of 85%, against 80% accuracy for the feature-based
approach. Furthermore, we showed that our BLSTM classifier could detect
lameness with as little as one second of video data.

Result: 在15个基准数据集上的实验表明，SemPT在多种设置下均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: SemPT通过属性级知识增强和动态推理选择，显著提升了视觉迁移学习的泛化能力。

Abstract: Visual transfer learning for unseen categories presents an active research
topic yet a challenging task, due to the inherent conflict between preserving
category-specific representations and acquiring transferable knowledge.
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) pre-trained on large amounts of image-text pairs
offer a promising solution. However, existing prompt tuning methods rely on
sparse category labels or disparate LLM-generated descriptions, which fragment
knowledge representation and hinder transferability. To address this
limitation, we introduce Semantic Prompt Tuning (SemPT), a novel framework that
tackles the generalization challenge by leveraging shared attribute-level
knowledge across categories. Specifically, SemPT adopts a two-step prompting
strategy to guide LLM in extracting shared visual attributes and generating
attribute-level descriptions, capturing transferable semantic cues beyond
labels while ensuring coherent structure. Then, visually guided weighting is
applied to the embeddings of attribute-level descriptions to reduce noise from
irrelevant attributes and enhance the text embeddings. Additionally, image
embeddings are jointly aligned with both label and attribute-enhanced text
embeddings, balancing discrimination for seen categories and transferability to
unseen ones. Considering the availability of category exposure, our inference
dynamically selects between standard label embeddings for seen categories and
attribute-enhanced embeddings for unseen ones to ensure effective adaptation.
Extensive experiments on 15 benchmark datasets demonstrate that SemPT achieves
state-of-the-art performance across various settings, including base-to-novel
generalization, cross-dataset transfer, cross-domain transfer, and few-shot
learning.

Conclusion: UniBench300和CL方法有效解决多模态任务整合问题，为未来研究提供新方向。

Abstract: Unifying multiple multi-modal visual object tracking (MMVOT) tasks draws
increasing attention due to the complementary nature of different modalities in
building robust tracking systems. Existing practices mix all data sensor types
in a single training procedure, structuring a parallel paradigm from the
data-centric perspective and aiming for a global optimum on the joint
distribution of the involved tasks. However, the absence of a unified benchmark
where all types of data coexist forces evaluations on separated benchmarks,
causing \textit{inconsistency} between training and testing, thus leading to
performance \textit{degradation}. To address these issues, this work advances
in two aspects: \ding{182} A unified benchmark, coined as UniBench300, is
introduced to bridge the inconsistency by incorporating multiple task data,
reducing inference passes from three to one and cutting time consumption by
27\%. \ding{183} The unification process is reformulated in a serial format,
progressively integrating new tasks. In this way, the performance degradation
can be specified as knowledge forgetting of previous tasks, which naturally
aligns with the philosophy of continual learning (CL), motivating further
exploration of injecting CL into the unification process. Extensive experiments
conducted on two baselines and four benchmarks demonstrate the significance of
UniBench300 and the superiority of CL in supporting a stable unification
process. Moreover, while conducting dedicated analyses, the performance
degradation is found to be negatively correlated with network capacity.
Additionally, modality discrepancies contribute to varying degradation levels
across tasks (RGBT > RGBD > RGBE in MMVOT), offering valuable insights for
future multi-modal vision research. Source codes and the proposed benchmark is
available at \textit{https://github.com/Zhangyong-Tang/UniBench300}.

Method: 提出两阶段训练协议：跨视图对齐调整和地址定位调整，结合卫星图像和街景图像，并引入自动标签生成机制。

Result: AddressVLM在两个街景VQA数据集上的平均地址定位准确率分别超过对比模型9%和12%。

Conclusion: AddressVLM通过跨视图对齐和两阶段训练，显著提升了细粒度地址定位能力。

Abstract: Large visual language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
in coarse-grained geo-localization at the country or city level, but they
struggle with fine-grained street-level localization within urban areas. In
this paper, we explore integrating city-wide address localization capabilities
into LVLMs, facilitating flexible address-related question answering using
street-view images. A key challenge is that the street-view visual
question-and-answer (VQA) data provides only microscopic visual cues, leading
to subpar performance in fine-tuned models. To tackle this issue, we
incorporate perspective-invariant satellite images as macro cues and propose
cross-view alignment tuning including a satellite-view and street-view image
grafting mechanism, along with an automatic label generation mechanism. Then
LVLM's global understanding of street distribution is enhanced through
cross-view matching. Our proposed model, named AddressVLM, consists of
two-stage training protocols: cross-view alignment tuning and address
localization tuning. Furthermore, we have constructed two street-view VQA
datasets based on image address localization datasets from Pittsburgh and San
Francisco. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that AddressVLM
outperforms counterpart LVLMs by over 9% and 12% in average address
localization accuracy on these two datasets, respectively.

Abstract: In this paper, we present our approach to the DataCV ICCV Challenge, which
centers on building a high-quality face dataset to train a face recognition
model. The constructed dataset must not contain identities overlapping with any
existing public face datasets. To handle this challenge, we begin with a
thorough cleaning of the baseline HSFace dataset, identifying and removing
mislabeled or inconsistent identities through a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
strategy combining face embedding clustering and GPT-4o-assisted verification.
We retain the largest consistent identity cluster and apply data augmentation
up to a fixed number of images per identity. To further diversify the dataset,
we generate synthetic identities using Stable Diffusion with prompt
engineering. As diffusion models are computationally intensive, we generate
only one reference image per identity and efficiently expand it using Vec2Face,
which rapidly produces 49 identity-consistent variants. This hybrid approach
fuses GAN-based and diffusion-based samples, enabling efficient construction of
a diverse and high-quality dataset. To address the high visual similarity among
synthetic identities, we adopt a curriculum learning strategy by placing them
early in the training schedule, allowing the model to progress from easier to
harder samples. Our final dataset contains 50 images per identity, and all
newly generated identities are checked with mainstream face datasets to ensure
no identity leakage. Our method achieves \textbf{1st place} in the competition,
and experimental results show that our dataset improves model performance
across 10K, 20K, and 100K identity scales. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有方法在红外小目标检测中仅建模低阶特征相关性，且局限于单一时间尺度，无法有效处理复杂运动模式。

Method: HyperTea整合CNN、RNN和HGNN，包含全局时间增强模块（GTEM）、局部时间增强模块（LTEM）和时间对齐模块（TAM）。

Result: 在DAUB和IRDST数据集上达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: HyperTea首次将CNN、RNN和HGNN结合，显著提升了红外小目标检测效果。

Abstract: In practical application scenarios, moving infrared small target detection
(MIRSTD) remains highly challenging due to the target's small size, weak
intensity, and complex motion pattern. Existing methods typically only model
low-order correlations between feature nodes and perform feature extraction and
enhancement within a single temporal scale. Although hypergraphs have been
widely used for high-order correlation learning, they have received limited
attention in MIRSTD. To explore the potential of hypergraphs and enhance
multi-timescale feature representation, we propose HyperTea, which integrates
global and local temporal perspectives to effectively model high-order
spatiotemporal correlations of features. HyperTea consists of three modules:
the global temporal enhancement module (GTEM) realizes global temporal context
enhancement through semantic aggregation and propagation; the local temporal
enhancement module (LTEM) is designed to capture local motion patterns between
adjacent frames and then enhance local temporal context; additionally, we
further develop a temporal alignment module (TAM) to address potential
cross-scale feature misalignment. To our best knowledge, HyperTea is the first
work to integrate convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural
networks (RNNs), and hypergraph neural networks (HGNNs) for MIRSTD,
significantly improving detection performance. Experiments on DAUB and IRDST
demonstrate its state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Our source codes are

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合隐式神经表示和物理信息正则化的方法，用于在胎儿脑MRI中联合重建多回波时间（TE）数据，以解决运动伪影问题，并展示了在0.55T场强下的首次胎儿T2映射结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胎儿脑MRI中T2映射在0.55T场强下具有潜力，但现有方法因运动伪影和长扫描时间而受限。

Method: 通过隐式神经表示和物理信息正则化联合重建多TE数据，减少运动影响并保持T2定量准确性。

Result: 在模拟胎儿脑和成人数据集上表现优异，并首次实现0.55T场强下的胎儿T2映射。

Conclusion: 该方法有望减少每个TE所需的扫描次数，提高胎儿脑MRI的效率和准确性。

Abstract: T2 mapping in fetal brain MRI has the potential to improve characterization
of the developing brain, especially at mid-field (0.55T), where T2 decay is
slower. However, this is challenging as fetal MRI acquisition relies on
multiple motion-corrupted stacks of thick slices, requiring slice-to-volume
reconstruction (SVR) to estimate a high-resolution (HR) 3D volume. Currently,
T2 mapping involves repeated acquisitions of these stacks at each echo time
(TE), leading to long scan times and high sensitivity to motion. We tackle this
challenge with a method that jointly reconstructs data across TEs, addressing
severe motion. Our approach combines implicit neural representations with a
physics-informed regularization that models T2 decay, enabling information
sharing across TEs while preserving anatomical and quantitative T2 fidelity. We
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on simulated fetal brain and in vivo
adult datasets with fetal-like motion. We also present the first in vivo fetal
T2 mapping results at 0.55T. Our study shows potential for reducing the number
of stacks per TE in T2 mapping by leveraging anatomical redundancy.

TL;DR: 提出IADGPT框架，通过三阶段训练策略解决FS-IAD任务，结合语言输出和注意力图实现异常检测与定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LVLMs缺乏工业知识和推理能力，无法媲美专业质检员，需改进。

Method: 三阶段渐进训练策略，前两阶段学习基础知识和差异意识，第三阶段基于上下文学习提升泛化能力。

Result: IADGPT在异常检测中表现优异，定位和推理能力也具竞争力。

Conclusion: IADGPT框架有效提升FS-IAD任务性能，数据集将公开。

Abstract: Few-Shot Industrial Anomaly Detection (FS-IAD) has important applications in
automating industrial quality inspection. Recently, some FS-IAD methods based
on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have been proposed with some
achievements through prompt learning or fine-tuning. However, existing LVLMs
focus on general tasks but lack basic industrial knowledge and reasoning
capabilities related to FS-IAD, making these methods far from specialized human
quality inspectors. To address these challenges, we propose a unified
framework, IADGPT, designed to perform FS-IAD in a human-like manner, while
also handling associated localization and reasoning tasks, even for diverse and
novel industrial products. To this end, we introduce a three-stage progressive
training strategy inspired by humans. Specifically, the first two stages
gradually guide IADGPT in acquiring fundamental industrial knowledge and
discrepancy awareness. In the third stage, we design an in-context
learning-based training paradigm, enabling IADGPT to leverage a few-shot image
as the exemplars for improved generalization to novel products. In addition, we
design a strategy that enables IADGPT to output image-level and pixel-level
anomaly scores using the logits output and the attention map, respectively, in
conjunction with the language output to accomplish anomaly reasoning. To
support our training, we present a new dataset comprising 100K images across
400 diverse industrial product categories with extensive attribute-level
textual annotations. Experiments indicate IADGPT achieves considerable
performance gains in anomaly detection and demonstrates competitiveness in
anomaly localization and reasoning. We will release our dataset in
camera-ready.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要微调大型扩散模型或从头训练，成本高昂且效果不佳，因此探索一种轻量级框架以直接利用预训练模型的能力。

Method: 使用相机姿态条件化的U-Net（TUNet）预测目标视图的潜在表示，并提出融合策略利用DDIM反演中的噪声相关性，保留细节。

Result: 在MVImgNet上的实验表明，该方法优于现有方法，实现了高质量的新视角合成。

Conclusion: 提出的TUNet框架和融合策略有效解决了单图新视角合成的挑战，具有高效性和高质量生成能力。

Abstract: Synthesizing novel views from a single input image is a challenging task. It
requires extrapolating the 3D structure of a scene while inferring details in
occluded regions, and maintaining geometric consistency across viewpoints. Many
existing methods must fine-tune large diffusion backbones using multiple views
or train a diffusion model from scratch, which is extremely expensive.
Additionally, they suffer from blurry reconstruction and poor generalization.
This gap presents the opportunity to explore an explicit lightweight view
translation framework that can directly utilize the high-fidelity generative
capabilities of a pretrained diffusion model while reconstructing a scene from
a novel view. Given the DDIM-inverted latent of a single input image, we employ
a camera pose-conditioned translation U-Net, TUNet, to predict the inverted
latent corresponding to the desired target view. However, the image sampled
using the predicted latent may result in a blurry reconstruction. To this end,
we propose a novel fusion strategy that exploits the inherent noise correlation
structure observed in DDIM inversion. The proposed fusion strategy helps
preserve the texture and fine-grained details. To synthesize the novel view, we
use the fused latent as the initial condition for DDIM sampling, leveraging the
generative prior of the pretrained diffusion model. Extensive experiments on
MVImgNet demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods.

### [178] [Beyond conventional vision: RGB-event fusion for robust object detection in dynamic traffic scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10704)
*Zhanwen Liu,Yujing Sun,Yang Wang,Nan Yang,Shengbo Eben Li,Xiangmo Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合事件相机和RGB相机的方法（MCFNet），通过动态范围增强和跨模态特征融合，显著提升了复杂交通场景下的目标检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RGB相机动态范围有限，导致复杂交通环境（如夜间驾驶、隧道）中全局对比度降低和高频细节丢失，影响目标检测性能。

Method: 提出MCFNet，包括事件校正模块（ECM）、事件动态上采样模块（EDUM）和跨模态融合模块（CMM），实现时空对齐和自适应特征融合。

Result: 在DSEC-Det和PKU-DAVIS-SOD数据集上，MCFNet显著优于现有方法，在DSEC-Det上mAP50提升7.4%，mAP提升1.7%。

Conclusion: MCFNet通过结合事件相机和RGB相机，有效解决了复杂光照下的目标检测问题，性能显著提升。

Abstract: The dynamic range limitation of conventional RGB cameras reduces global
contrast and causes loss of high-frequency details such as textures and edges
in complex traffic environments (e.g., nighttime driving, tunnels), hindering
discriminative feature extraction and degrading frame-based object detection.
To address this, we integrate a bio-inspired event camera with an RGB camera to
provide high dynamic range information and propose a motion cue fusion network
(MCFNet), which achieves optimal spatiotemporal alignment and adaptive
cross-modal feature fusion under challenging lighting. Specifically, an event
correction module (ECM) temporally aligns asynchronous event streams with image
frames via optical-flow-based warping, jointly optimized with the detection
network to learn task-aware event representations. The event dynamic upsampling
module (EDUM) enhances spatial resolution of event frames to match image
structures, ensuring precise spatiotemporal alignment. The cross-modal mamba
fusion module (CMM) uses adaptive feature fusion with a novel interlaced
scanning mechanism, effectively integrating complementary information for
robust detection. Experiments conducted on the DSEC-Det and PKU-DAVIS-SOD
datasets demonstrate that MCFNet significantly outperforms existing methods in
various poor lighting and fast moving traffic scenarios. Notably, on the
DSEC-Det dataset, MCFNet achieves a remarkable improvement, surpassing the best
existing methods by 7.4% in mAP50 and 1.7% in mAP metrics, respectively. The
code is available at https://github.com/Charm11492/MCFNet.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CountCluster的方法，通过优化对象交叉注意力图的分簇，以更准确地生成符合输入提示中对象数量的图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的扩散模型在生成图像时难以准确反映输入提示中指定的对象数量，尤其是在早期去噪步骤中。

Method: CountCluster方法在推理时根据注意力分数将对象交叉注意力图分为k个簇，并优化潜在空间以匹配目标分布。

Result: 该方法在对象数量准确性上平均提高了18.5%，并在多种提示下表现出优越的数量控制性能。

Conclusion: CountCluster无需外部工具或额外训练，有效提升了扩散模型在对象数量控制上的表现。

Abstract: Diffusion-based text-to-image generation models have demonstrated strong
performance in terms of image quality and diversity. However, they still
struggle to generate images that accurately reflect the number of objects
specified in the input prompt. Several approaches have been proposed that rely
on either external counting modules for iterative refinement or quantity
representations derived from learned tokens or latent features. However, they
still have limitations in accurately reflecting the specified number of objects
and overlook an important structural characteristic--The number of object
instances in the generated image is largely determined in the early timesteps
of the denoising process. To correctly reflect the object quantity for image
generation, the highly activated regions in the object cross-attention map at
the early timesteps should match the input object quantity, while each region
should be clearly separated. To address this issue, we propose
\textit{CountCluster}, a method that guides the object cross-attention map to
be clustered according to the specified object count in the input, without
relying on any external tools or additional training. The proposed method
partitions the object cross-attention map into $k$ clusters at inference time
based on attention scores, defines an ideal distribution in which each cluster
is spatially well-separated, and optimizes the latent to align with this target
distribution. Our method achieves an average improvement of 18.5\%p in object
count accuracy compared to existing methods, and demonstrates superior quantity
control performance across a variety of prompts. Code will be released at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉强化学习需要从高维输入和噪声奖励中同时学习感知和动作，现有大感知模型在RL中的有效整合尚不明确。

Method: SegDAC利用SAM进行对象中心分解，YOLO-World通过文本提示语义标注，采用基于Transformer的动态架构，在线RL学习关注哪些片段。

Result: 在Maniskill3基准测试中，SegDAC在视觉泛化性能上翻倍，样本效率优于或匹配现有方法。

Conclusion: SegDAC通过对象中心分割和语义标注，显著提升了视觉强化学习的泛化能力和效率。

Abstract: Visual reinforcement learning (RL) is challenging due to the need to learn
both perception and actions from high-dimensional inputs and noisy rewards.
Although large perception models exist, integrating them effectively into RL
for visual generalization and improved sample efficiency remains unclear. We
propose SegDAC, a Segmentation-Driven Actor-Critic method. SegDAC uses Segment
Anything (SAM) for object-centric decomposition and YOLO-World to ground
segments semantically via text prompts. It includes a novel transformer-based
architecture that supports a dynamic number of segments at each time step and
effectively learns which segments to focus on using online RL, without using
human labels. By evaluating SegDAC over a challenging visual generalization
benchmark using Maniskill3, which covers diverse manipulation tasks under
strong visual perturbations, we demonstrate that SegDAC achieves significantly
better visual generalization, doubling prior performance on the hardest setting
and matching or surpassing prior methods in sample efficiency across all
evaluated tasks.

Result: 验证了模型在FPGA上部署的可行性，并成功实现了船只与风力机的二分类。

Conclusion: 该方法为星上处理提供了可行方案，缓解了带宽和延迟问题。

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data enables large-scale surveillance of
maritime vessels. However, near-real-time monitoring is currently constrained
by the need to downlink all raw data, perform image focusing, and subsequently
analyze it on the ground. On-board processing to generate higher-level products
could reduce the data volume that needs to be downlinked, alleviating bandwidth
constraints and minimizing latency. However, traditional image focusing and
processing algorithms face challenges due to the satellite's limited memory,
processing power, and computational resources. This work proposes and evaluates
neural networks designed for real-time inference on unfocused SAR data acquired
in Stripmap and Interferometric Wide (IW) modes captured with Sentinel-1. Our
results demonstrate the feasibility of using one of our models for on-board
processing and deployment on an FPGA. Additionally, by investigating a binary
classification task between ships and windmills, we demonstrate that target
classification is possible.

Conclusion: 论文通过改进跨视角图像匹配，实现了更精确的跨视角定位，并提供了首个像素级对应标注的基准数据集。

Abstract: Cross-view localization aims to estimate the 3 degrees of freedom pose of a
ground-view image by registering it to aerial or satellite imagery. It is
essential in GNSS-denied environments such as urban canyons and disaster zones.
Existing methods either regress poses directly or align features in a shared
bird's-eye view (BEV) space, both built upon accurate spatial correspondences
between perspectives. However, these methods fail to establish strict
cross-view correspondences, yielding only coarse or geometrically inconsistent
matches. Consequently, fine-grained image matching between ground and aerial
views remains an unsolved problem, which in turn constrains the
interpretability of localization results. In this paper, we revisit cross-view
localization from the perspective of cross-view image matching and propose a
novel framework that improves both matching and localization. Specifically, we
introduce a Surface Model to model visible regions for accurate BEV projection,
and a SimRefiner module to refine the similarity matrix through local-global
residual correction, eliminating the reliance on post-processing like RANSAC.
To further support research in this area, we introduce CVFM, the first
benchmark with 32,509 cross-view image pairs annotated with pixel-level
correspondences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
substantially improves both localization accuracy and image matching quality,
setting new baselines under extreme viewpoint disparity.

Motivation: 现有方法仅利用token索引值训练自回归生成模型，忽略了代码本中丰富的token相似性信息。k-means聚类在代码本特征空间中表现不佳，存在token空间差异和质心距离不准确的问题。

Method: 提出DCPE方法，采用基于实例的距离替代质心距离，并通过凝聚合并技术解决token空间差异问题。

Conclusion: DCPE是一种即插即用的方法，有效挖掘和利用代码本中的token相似性信息，显著提升自回归模型的训练效率和生成质量。

Abstract: Advanced discrete token-based autoregressive image generation systems first
tokenize images into sequences of token indices with a codebook, and then model
these sequences in an autoregressive paradigm. While autoregressive generative
models are trained only on index values, the prior encoded in the codebook,
which contains rich token similarity information, is not exploited. Recent
studies have attempted to incorporate this prior by performing naive k-means
clustering on the tokens, helping to facilitate the training of generative
models with a reduced codebook. However, we reveal that k-means clustering
performs poorly in the codebook feature space due to inherent issues, including
token space disparity and centroid distance inaccuracy. In this work, we
propose the Discriminative Codebook Prior Extractor (DCPE) as an alternative to
k-means clustering for more effectively mining and utilizing the token
similarity information embedded in the codebook. DCPE replaces the commonly
used centroid-based distance, which is found to be unsuitable and inaccurate
for the token feature space, with a more reasonable instance-based distance.
Using an agglomerative merging technique, it further addresses the token space
disparity issue by avoiding splitting high-density regions and aggregating
low-density ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DCPE is plug-and-play
and integrates seamlessly with existing codebook prior-based paradigms. With
the discriminative prior extracted, DCPE accelerates the training of
autoregressive models by 42% on LlamaGen-B and improves final FID and IS
performance.

Motivation: 现有EgocentricQA研究局限于日常活动，而实际应用需应对领域差异，因此需评估模型在多样化领域的泛化能力。

Method: 构建EgoCross基准，覆盖手术、工业、极限运动和动物视角四个领域，包含1,000个QA对，支持OpenQA和CloseQA格式。

Result: 实验表明现有MLLMs在非日常生活领域泛化能力不足，尝试微调和强化学习以探索改进方向。

Conclusion: EgoCross为领域自适应、鲁棒的自我中心视频理解研究奠定基础，数据和代码已开源。

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
significantly pushed the frontier of egocentric video question answering
(EgocentricQA). However, existing benchmarks and studies are mainly limited to
common daily activities such as cooking and cleaning. In contrast, real-world
deployment inevitably encounters domain shifts, where target domains differ
substantially in both visual style and semantic content. To bridge this gap, we
introduce \textbf{EgoCross}, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the
cross-domain generalization of MLLMs in EgocentricQA. EgoCross covers four
diverse and challenging domains, including surgery, industry, extreme sports,
and animal perspective, representing realistic and high-impact application
scenarios. It comprises approximately 1,000 QA pairs across 798 video clips,
spanning four key QA tasks: prediction, recognition, localization, and
counting. Each QA pair provides both OpenQA and CloseQA formats to support
fine-grained evaluation. Extensive experiments show that most existing MLLMs,
whether general-purpose or egocentric-specialized, struggle to generalize to
domains beyond daily life, highlighting the limitations of current models.
Furthermore, we conduct several pilot studies, \eg, fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning, to explore potential improvements. We hope EgoCross and
our accompanying analysis will serve as a foundation for advancing
domain-adaptive, robust egocentric video understanding. Data and codes will be

Abstract: Human perceptual systems excel at inducing and recognizing objects across
both known and novel categories, a capability far beyond current machine
learning frameworks. While generalized category discovery (GCD) aims to bridge
this gap, existing methods predominantly focus on optimizing objective
functions. We present an orthogonal solution, inspired by the human cognitive
process for novel object understanding: decomposing objects into visual
primitives and establishing cross-knowledge comparisons. We propose ConGCD,
which establishes primitive-oriented representations through high-level
semantic reconstruction, binding intra-class shared attributes via
deconstruction. Mirroring human preference diversity in visual processing,
where distinct individuals leverage dominant or contextual cues, we implement
dominant and contextual consensus units to capture class-discriminative
patterns and inherent distributional invariants, respectively. A consensus
scheduler dynamically optimizes activation pathways, with final predictions
emerging through multiplex consensus integration. Extensive evaluations across
coarse- and fine-grained benchmarks demonstrate ConGCD's effectiveness as a
consensus-aware paradigm. Code is available at github.com/lytang63/ConGCD.

Abstract: This paper presents a summary of the 2025 Sclera Segmentation Benchmarking
Competition (SSBC), which focused on the development of privacy-preserving
sclera-segmentation models trained using synthetically generated ocular images.
The goal of the competition was to evaluate how well models trained on
synthetic data perform in comparison to those trained on real-world datasets.
The competition featured two tracks: $(i)$ one relying solely on synthetic data
for model development, and $(ii)$ one combining/mixing synthetic with (a
limited amount of) real-world data. A total of nine research groups submitted
diverse segmentation models, employing a variety of architectural designs,
including transformer-based solutions, lightweight models, and segmentation
networks guided by generative frameworks. Experiments were conducted across
three evaluation datasets containing both synthetic and real-world images,
collected under diverse conditions. Results show that models trained entirely
on synthetic data can achieve competitive performance, particularly when
dedicated training strategies are employed, as evidenced by the top performing
models that achieved $F_1$ scores of over $0.8$ in the synthetic data track.
Moreover, performance gains in the mixed track were often driven more by
methodological choices rather than by the inclusion of real data, highlighting
the promise of synthetic data for privacy-aware biometric development. The code

Abstract: Symmetry is a fundamental concept that has been extensively studied, yet
detecting it in complex scenes remains a significant challenge in computer
vision. Recent heatmap-based approaches can localize potential regions of
symmetry axes but often lack precision in identifying individual axes. In this
work, we propose a novel framework for axis-level detection of the two most
common symmetry types-reflection and rotation-by representing them as explicit
geometric primitives, i.e. lines and points. Our method employs a dual-branch
architecture that is equivariant to the dihedral group, with each branch
specialized to exploit the structure of dihedral group-equivariant features for
its respective symmetry type. For reflection symmetry, we introduce
orientational anchors, aligned with group components, to enable
orientation-specific detection, and a reflectional matching that measures
similarity between patterns and their mirrored counterparts across candidate
axes. For rotational symmetry, we propose a rotational matching that compares
patterns at fixed angular intervals to identify rotational centers. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance,
outperforming existing approaches.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度伪造检测方法在未知伪造技术上表现不佳，亟需开发具有强泛化能力的检测技术。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在不同场景下泛化能力强，能有效应对未知伪造挑战。

Conclusion: FGL和DPNet为深度伪造检测提供了强有力的支持，代码已开源。

Abstract: The emergence of deepfake technology has introduced a range of societal
problems, garnering considerable attention. Current deepfake detection methods
perform well on specific datasets, but exhibit poor performance when applied to
datasets with unknown forgery techniques. Moreover, as the gap between emerging
and traditional forgery techniques continues to widen, cross-domain detection
methods that rely on common forgery traces are becoming increasingly
ineffective. This situation highlights the urgency of developing deepfake
detection technology with strong generalization to cope with fast iterative
forgery techniques. To address these challenges, we propose a Forgery Guided
Learning (FGL) strategy designed to enable detection networks to continuously
adapt to unknown forgery techniques. Specifically, the FGL strategy captures
the differential information between known and unknown forgery techniques,
allowing the model to dynamically adjust its learning process in real time. To
further improve the ability to perceive forgery traces, we design a Dual
Perception Network (DPNet) that captures both differences and relationships
among forgery traces. In the frequency stream, the network dynamically
perceives and extracts discriminative features across various forgery
techniques, establishing essential detection cues. These features are then
integrated with spatial features and projected into the embedding space. In
addition, graph convolution is employed to perceive relationships across the
entire feature space, facilitating a more comprehensive understanding of
forgery trace correlations. Extensive experiments show that our approach
generalizes well across different scenarios and effectively handles unknown
forgery challenges, providing robust support for deepfake detection. Our code
is available on https://github.com/vpsg-research/FGL.

TL;DR: DARC是一种新型模型驱动的群组配准框架，用于构建医学图像图谱，支持多种图像差异度量，高效处理3D图像，并具有高解剖保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决数据驱动方法依赖大数据集、泛化性差的问题，以及模型驱动方法在大规模3D数据中的扩展性和优化挑战。

Method: 采用坐标下降策略和中心性激活函数，实现无偏、微分同胚的图谱构建。

Result: DARC在一次性分割和形状合成应用中表现优异，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DARC为图谱构建及应用提供了灵活、泛化性强且资源高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Atlas construction is fundamental to medical image analysis, offering a
standardized spatial reference for tasks such as population-level anatomical
modeling. While data-driven registration methods have recently shown promise in
pairwise settings, their reliance on large training datasets, limited
generalizability, and lack of true inference phases in groupwise contexts
hinder their practical use. In contrast, model-driven methods offer
training-free, theoretically grounded, and data-efficient alternatives, though
they often face scalability and optimization challenges when applied to large
3D datasets. In this work, we introduce DARC (Diffeomorphic Atlas Registration
via Coordinate descent), a novel model-driven groupwise registration framework
for atlas construction. DARC supports a broad range of image dissimilarity
metrics and efficiently handles arbitrary numbers of 3D images without
incurring GPU memory issues. Through a coordinate descent strategy and a
centrality-enforcing activation function, DARC produces unbiased, diffeomorphic
atlases with high anatomical fidelity. Beyond atlas construction, we
demonstrate two key applications: (1) One-shot segmentation, where labels
annotated only on the atlas are propagated to subjects via inverse
deformations, outperforming state-of-the-art few-shot methods; and (2) shape
synthesis, where new anatomical variants are generated by warping the atlas
mesh using synthesized diffeomorphic deformation fields. Overall, DARC offers a
flexible, generalizable, and resource-efficient framework for atlas
construction and applications.

TL;DR: 论文分析了主流视觉语言模型在时空物理推理任务上的不足，并提出了一种改进方法，显著提升了性能，但泛化能力仍有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时空物理推理是理解现实物理世界的基础能力，但现有视觉语言模型在此任务上的表现尚未充分探索。

Method: 采用监督微调结合基于规则的强化学习方法改进Qwen2.5-VL-7B模型。

Result: 改进后的模型在时空物理推理任务上表现显著提升，超越主流专有模型。

Conclusion: 尽管性能提升，模型对新物理场景的泛化能力仍有限，需进一步研究新方法。

Abstract: Spatio-physical reasoning, a foundation capability for understanding the real
physics world, is a critical step towards building robust world models. While
recent vision language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable progress in
specialized domains like multimodal mathematics and pure spatial understanding,
their capability for spatio-physical reasoning remains largely unexplored. This
paper provides a comprehensive diagnostic analysis of mainstream VLMs,
revealing that current models perform inadequately on this crucial task.
Further detailed analysis shows that this underperformance is largely
attributable to biases caused by human-like prior and a lack of deep reasoning.
To address these challenges, we apply supervised fine-tuning followed by
rule-based reinforcement learning to Qwen2.5-VL-7B, resulting in significant
improvements in spatio-physical reasoning capabilities and surpassing leading
proprietary models. Nevertheless, despite this success, the model's
generalization to new physics scenarios remains limited -- underscoring the
pressing need for new approaches in spatio-physical reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI生成内容的发展带来了高度真实的合成视频，对社会信任和数字完整性构成威胁，现有基准在真实感、规模和复杂性上不足，无法有效评估现代视觉语言模型。

Method: 引入AEGIS数据集，包含10,000多个经过严格筛选的真实和合成视频，涵盖多种先进生成模型，并提供多模态标注。

Result: 实验表明，现有模型在AEGIS最具挑战性的子集上检测能力有限，凸显了数据集的独特复杂性和真实感。

Conclusion: AEGIS为开发真正鲁棒、可靠且广泛通用的视频真实性检测方法提供了不可或缺的评估基准。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-generated content have fueled the rise of highly
realistic synthetic videos, posing severe risks to societal trust and digital
integrity. Existing benchmarks for video authenticity detection typically
suffer from limited realism, insufficient scale, and inadequate complexity,
failing to effectively evaluate modern vision-language models against
sophisticated forgeries. To address this critical gap, we introduce AEGIS, a
novel large-scale benchmark explicitly targeting the detection of
hyper-realistic and semantically nuanced AI-generated videos. AEGIS comprises
over 10,000 rigorously curated real and synthetic videos generated by diverse,
state-of-the-art generative models, including Stable Video Diffusion,
CogVideoX-5B, KLing, and Sora, encompassing open-source and proprietary
architectures. In particular, AEGIS features specially constructed challenging
subsets enhanced with robustness evaluation. Furthermore, we provide multimodal
annotations spanning Semantic-Authenticity Descriptions, Motion Features, and
Low-level Visual Features, facilitating authenticity detection and supporting
downstream tasks such as multimodal fusion and forgery localization. Extensive
experiments using advanced vision-language models demonstrate limited detection
capabilities on the most challenging subsets of AEGIS, highlighting the
dataset's unique complexity and realism beyond the current generalization
capabilities of existing models. In essence, AEGIS establishes an indispensable
evaluation benchmark, fundamentally advancing research toward developing
genuinely robust, reliable, broadly generalizable video authenticity detection
methodologies capable of addressing real-world forgery threats. Our dataset is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BLADE提出了一种数据无关的联合训练框架，结合自适应块稀疏注意力机制和稀疏感知的步蒸馏方法，显著加速视频生成模型推理，同时提升生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散变换器在高质量视频生成中表现优异，但其迭代去噪过程慢且长序列的二次注意力成本高，导致推理瓶颈。现有加速方法（步蒸馏和稀疏注意力）单独使用效果有限，联合训练又面临数据需求高的挑战。

Method: BLADE框架包含自适应块稀疏注意力机制（动态生成内容感知的稀疏掩码）和稀疏感知的步蒸馏范式（基于轨迹分布匹配，直接整合稀疏性）。

Result: 在CogVideoX-5B和Wan2.1-1.3B模型上，BLADE分别实现8.89x和14.10x的推理加速，并在VBench-2.0基准测试中提升生成质量分数。

Conclusion: BLADE通过联合训练框架有效解决了视频生成模型的推理效率问题，同时提升了生成质量，为实际应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion transformers currently lead the field in high-quality video
generation, but their slow iterative denoising process and prohibitive
quadratic attention costs for long sequences create significant inference
bottlenecks. While both step distillation and sparse attention mechanisms have
shown promise as independent acceleration strategies, effectively combining
these approaches presents critical challenges -- training-free integration
yields suboptimal results, while separately training sparse attention after
step distillation requires prohibitively expensive high-quality video data. To
overcome these limitations, we propose BLADE, an innovative data-free joint
training framework that introduces: (1) an Adaptive Block-Sparse Attention
(ASA) mechanism for dynamically generating content-aware sparsity masks to
focus computation on salient spatiotemporal features, and (2) a sparsity-aware
step distillation paradigm built upon Trajectory Distribution Matching (TDM)
that directly incorporates sparsity into the distillation process rather than
treating it as a separate compression step, with fast convergence. We validate
BLADE on text-to-video models like CogVideoX-5B and Wan2.1-1.3B. Our framework
demonstrates remarkable efficiency gains across different scales. On
Wan2.1-1.3B, BLADE achieves a 14.10x end-to-end inference acceleration over a
50-step baseline. Moreover, on models such as CogVideoX-5B with short video
sequence lengths, our framework delivers a robust 8.89x speedup. Crucially, the
acceleration is accompanied by a consistent quality improvement. On the
VBench-2.0 benchmark, BLADE boosts the score of CogVideoX-5B to 0.569 (from
0.534) and Wan2.1-1.3B to 0.570 (from 0.563), results that are further
corroborated by superior ratings in human evaluations. Our code and model
weights are publicly available at: http://ziplab.co/BLADE-Homepage/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于ControlNet的RefSR方法难以有效对齐LR与参考HR图像，且数据集分辨率低、质量差，导致参考图像缺乏细节。

Method: 设计TriFlowSR框架，采用Reference Matching Strategy实现LR与参考HR图像的高效匹配。

Result: 实验表明，TriFlowSR能更好地利用参考HR图像的语义和纹理信息。

Conclusion: TriFlowSR是首个针对UHD地标场景的基于扩散的RefSR方法，解决了真实世界退化问题。

Abstract: Reference-based Image Super-Resolution (RefSR) aims to restore a
low-resolution (LR) image by utilizing the semantic and texture information
from an additional reference high-resolution (reference HR) image. Existing
diffusion-based RefSR methods are typically built upon ControlNet, which
struggles to effectively align the information between the LR image and the
reference HR image. Moreover, current RefSR datasets suffer from limited
resolution and poor image quality, resulting in the reference images lacking
sufficient fine-grained details to support high-quality restoration. To
overcome the limitations above, we propose TriFlowSR, a novel framework that
explicitly achieves pattern matching between the LR image and the reference HR
image. Meanwhile, we introduce Landmark-4K, the first RefSR dataset for
Ultra-High-Definition (UHD) landmark scenarios. Considering the UHD scenarios
with real-world degradation, in TriFlowSR, we design a Reference Matching
Strategy to effectively match the LR image with the reference HR image.
Experimental results show that our approach can better utilize the semantic and
texture information of the reference HR image compared to previous methods. To
the best of our knowledge, we propose the first diffusion-based RefSR pipeline
for ultra-high definition landmark scenarios under real-world degradation. Our
code and model will be available at https://github.com/nkicsl/TriFlowSR.

Motivation: 解决传统被动活体检测方法在面对多种攻击（如照片、屏幕显示、面具和视频重放）时的局限性。

Method: 设计了一种用户交互场景，要求参与者缓慢将面部靠近相机，结合光流分析和神经网络分类器处理RGB帧和光流数据。

Result: 该方法能够更可靠地区分真实面部和多种攻击手段，显著提升了活体检测性能。

Conclusion: 通过特定交互动作和光流分析，该方法为活体检测提供了一种更鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: In this work, we proposed a novel cooperative video-based face liveness
detection method based on a new user interaction scenario where participants
are instructed to slowly move their frontal-oriented face closer to the camera.
This controlled approaching face protocol, combined with optical flow analysis,
represents the core innovation of our approach. By designing a system where
users follow this specific movement pattern, we enable robust extraction of
facial volume information through neural optical flow estimation, significantly
improving discrimination between genuine faces and various presentation attacks
(including printed photos, screen displays, masks, and video replays). Our
method processes both the predicted optical flows and RGB frames through a
neural classifier, effectively leveraging spatial-temporal features for more
reliable liveness detection compared to passive methods.

TL;DR: VasoMIM是一种针对X射线血管造影的自监督学习框架，通过结合血管解剖知识改进掩码图像建模，显著提升了血管分割性能。


<details>

Motivation: X射线血管造影中血管分割的准确性对临床应用至关重要，但标注数据稀缺，且传统自监督学习方法因血管与背景像素不平衡而表现不佳。

Method: 提出VasoMIM框架，包含解剖引导的掩码策略和解剖一致性损失，优先掩码血管区域并强化血管语义一致性。

Result: 在三个数据集上实现最先进性能。

Conclusion: VasoMIM为X射线血管造影分析提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate vessel segmentation in X-ray angiograms is crucial for numerous
clinical applications. However, the scarcity of annotated data presents a
significant challenge, which has driven the adoption of self-supervised
learning (SSL) methods such as masked image modeling (MIM) to leverage
large-scale unlabeled data for learning transferable representations.
Unfortunately, conventional MIM often fails to capture vascular anatomy because
of the severe class imbalance between vessel and background pixels, leading to
weak vascular representations. To address this, we introduce Vascular
anatomy-aware Masked Image Modeling (VasoMIM), a novel MIM framework tailored
for X-ray angiograms that explicitly integrates anatomical knowledge into the
pre-training process. Specifically, it comprises two complementary components:
anatomy-guided masking strategy and anatomical consistency loss. The former
preferentially masks vessel-containing patches to focus the model on
reconstructing vessel-relevant regions. The latter enforces consistency in
vascular semantics between the original and reconstructed images, thereby
improving the discriminability of vascular representations. Empirically,
VasoMIM achieves state-of-the-art performance across three datasets. These
findings highlight its potential to facilitate X-ray angiogram analysis.

Conclusion: OF-Diff通过改进生成图像的保真度和多样性，为遥感图像生成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: High-precision controllable remote sensing image generation is both
meaningful and challenging. Existing diffusion models often produce
low-fidelity images due to their inability to adequately capture morphological
details, which may affect the robustness and reliability of object detection
models. To enhance the accuracy and fidelity of generated objects in remote
sensing, this paper proposes Object Fidelity Diffusion (OF-Diff), which
effectively improves the fidelity of generated objects. Specifically, we are
the first to extract the prior shapes of objects based on the layout for
diffusion models in remote sensing. Then, we introduce a dual-branch diffusion
model with diffusion consistency loss, which can generate high-fidelity remote
sensing images without providing real images during the sampling phase.
Furthermore, we introduce DDPO to fine-tune the diffusion process, making the
generated remote sensing images more diverse and semantically consistent.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that OF-Diff outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in the remote sensing across key quality metrics. Notably, the
performance of several polymorphic and small object classes shows significant
improvement. For instance, the mAP increases by 8.3%, 7.7%, and 4.0% for
airplanes, ships, and vehicles, respectively.

planing ability, we also evaluate it on the AndroidWorld, an online UI

balances the distribution of sparse but critical actions, leading to more

Motivation: 现有自监督立体匹配方法在遮挡区域因光度一致性假设失效而表现不佳，需要一种新方法解决这一问题。

Method: 采用教师-学生范式和多基线输入，利用教师模型在遮挡区域的预测指导学生模型，并引入遮挡感知注意力图。

Result: BaCon-Stereo在KITTI 2015和2012基准测试中优于现有自监督方法，提升了遮挡和非遮挡区域的预测性能。

Conclusion: BaCon-Stereo通过对比学习和多基线输入有效解决了遮挡区域的匹配问题，具有强泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Current self-supervised stereo matching relies on the photometric consistency
assumption, which breaks down in occluded regions due to ill-posed
correspondences. To address this issue, we propose BaCon-Stereo, a simple yet
effective contrastive learning framework for self-supervised stereo network
training in both non-occluded and occluded regions. We adopt a teacher-student
paradigm with multi-baseline inputs, in which the stereo pairs fed into the
teacher and student share the same reference view but differ in target views.
Geometrically, regions occluded in the student's target view are often visible
in the teacher's, making it easier for the teacher to predict in these regions.
The teacher's prediction is rescaled to match the student's baseline and then
used to supervise the student. We also introduce an occlusion-aware attention
map to better guide the student in learning occlusion completion. To support
training, we synthesize a multi-baseline dataset BaCon-20k. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that BaCon-Stereo improves prediction in both occluded
and non-occluded regions, achieves strong generalization and robustness, and
outperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised methods on both KITTI 2015 and
2012 benchmarks. Our code and dataset will be released upon paper acceptance.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has proven essential for privacy-preserving,
collaborative training across distributed clients. Our prior work, TransFed,
introduced a robust transformer-based FL framework that leverages a
learn-to-adapt hypernetwork to generate personalized focal modulation layers
per client, outperforming traditional methods in non-IID and cross-domain
settings. In this extended version, we propose AdaptFED, where we deepen the
investigation of focal modulation in generalizable FL by incorporating: (1) a
refined adaptation strategy that integrates task-aware client embeddings to
personalize modulation dynamics further, (2) enhanced theoretical bounds on
adaptation performance, and (3) broader empirical validation across additional
modalities, including time-series and multilingual data. We also introduce an
efficient variant of TransFed that reduces server-client communication overhead
via low-rank hypernetwork conditioning, enabling scalable deployment in
resource-constrained environments. Extensive experiments on eight diverse
datasets reaffirm the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art
baselines, particularly in source-free and cross-task federated setups. Our
findings not only extend the capabilities of focal modulation in FL but also
pave the way for more adaptive, scalable, and generalizable transformer-based

Abstract: Recent advancements in video generation have enabled the creation of
high-quality, visually compelling videos. However, generating videos that

requiring realism and accuracy. In this work, we propose PhysHPO, a novel
framework for Hierarchical Cross-Modal Direct Preference Optimization, to
tackle this challenge by enabling fine-grained preference alignment for
physically plausible video generation. PhysHPO optimizes video alignment across
four hierarchical granularities: a) Instance Level, aligning the overall video
content with the input prompt; b) State Level, ensuring temporal consistency
using boundary frames as anchors; c) Motion Level, modeling motion trajectories
for realistic dynamics; and d) Semantic Level, maintaining logical consistency
between narrative and visuals. Recognizing that real-world videos are the best
reflections of physical phenomena, we further introduce an automated data
selection pipeline to efficiently identify and utilize "good data" from
existing large-scale text-video datasets, thereby eliminating the need for
costly and time-intensive dataset construction. Extensive experiments on both
physics-focused and general capability benchmarks demonstrate that PhysHPO
significantly improves physical plausibility and overall video generation
quality of advanced models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
work to explore fine-grained preference alignment and data selection for video
generation, paving the way for more realistic and human-preferred video
generation paradigms.

*Mojtaba Safari,Shansong Wang,Mingzhe Hu,Zach Eidex,Qiang Li,Xiaofeng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文评估了GPT-4o、GPT-5-nano、GPT-5-mini和GPT-5在脑肿瘤视觉问答任务中的表现，发现GPT-5-mini表现最佳，但整体准确性未达到临床可用水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑肿瘤类型的准确分类对治疗规划至关重要，研究探索了大型语言模型在视觉问答任务中的潜力。

Method: 使用BraTS数据集的多序列MRI和临床特征，评估模型在零样本链式思考任务中的表现。

Result: GPT-5-mini表现最佳（44.19%），但所有模型准确性均未达到临床要求。

Conclusion: GPT-5系列模型在神经肿瘤VQA任务中表现中等，但尚不适合临床使用。

Abstract: Accurate differentiation of brain tumor types on magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) is critical for guiding treatment planning in neuro-oncology. Recent
advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled visual question answering
(VQA) approaches that integrate image interpretation with natural language
reasoning. In this study, we evaluated GPT-4o, GPT-5-nano, GPT-5-mini, and
GPT-5 on a curated brain tumor VQA benchmark derived from 3 Brain Tumor
Segmentation (BraTS) datasets - glioblastoma (GLI), meningioma (MEN), and brain
metastases (MET). Each case included multi-sequence MRI triplanar mosaics and
structured clinical features transformed into standardized VQA items. Models
were assessed in a zero-shot chain-of-thought setting for accuracy on both
visual and reasoning tasks. Results showed that GPT-5-mini achieved the highest
macro-average accuracy (44.19%), followed by GPT-5 (43.71%), GPT-4o (41.49%),
and GPT-5-nano (35.85%). Performance varied by tumor subtype, with no single
model dominating across all cohorts. These findings suggest that GPT-5 family
models can achieve moderate accuracy in structured neuro-oncological VQA tasks,
but not at a level acceptable for clinical use.

high-resolution variants, bringing the total to 1.6M 3D instances. TexVerse
also includes specialized subsets: TexVerse-Skeleton, with 69K rigged models,
and TexVerse-Animation, with 54K animated models, both preserving original
skeleton and animation data uploaded by the user. We also provide detailed
model annotations describing overall characteristics, structural components,
and intricate features. TexVerse offers a high-quality data resource with
wide-ranging potential applications in texture synthesis, PBR material
development, animation, and various 3D vision and graphics tasks.

TL;DR: ToonComposer是一个生成模型，将中间帧生成和上色统一为一个阶段，通过稀疏草图注入和卡通适配方法提升效率和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统动画制作需多阶段人工操作，现有AI方法分开处理导致错误累积。ToonComposer旨在统一流程并减少人工负担。

Method: 采用稀疏草图注入机制和空间低秩适配器，将现代视频基础模型适配到卡通领域。

Result: 在视觉质量、运动一致性和生产效率上优于现有方法，支持稀疏输入和多草图控制。

Conclusion: ToonComposer为AI辅助卡通制作提供了更高效灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Traditional cartoon and anime production involves keyframing, inbetweening,
and colorization stages, which require intensive manual effort. Despite recent
advances in AI, existing methods often handle these stages separately, leading
to error accumulation and artifacts. For instance, inbetweening approaches
struggle with large motions, while colorization methods require dense per-frame
sketches. To address this, we introduce ToonComposer, a generative model that
unifies inbetweening and colorization into a single post-keyframing stage.
ToonComposer employs a sparse sketch injection mechanism to provide precise
control using keyframe sketches. Additionally, it uses a cartoon adaptation
method with the spatial low-rank adapter to tailor a modern video foundation
model to the cartoon domain while keeping its temporal prior intact. Requiring
as few as a single sketch and a colored reference frame, ToonComposer excels
with sparse inputs, while also supporting multiple sketches at any temporal
location for more precise motion control. This dual capability reduces manual
workload and improves flexibility, empowering artists in real-world scenarios.
To evaluate our model, we further created PKBench, a benchmark featuring
human-drawn sketches that simulate real-world use cases. Our evaluation
demonstrates that ToonComposer outperforms existing methods in visual quality,
motion consistency, and production efficiency, offering a superior and more
flexible solution for AI-assisted cartoon production.

TL;DR: STream3R是一种基于Transformer的3D重建方法，通过流式处理和因果注意力机制高效处理图像序列，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多视图3D重建方法依赖昂贵的全局优化或简单内存机制，难以处理长序列和动态场景。

Method: 采用解码器-仅Transformer架构，结合因果注意力和几何先验，实现流式处理。

Result: 在静态和动态场景基准测试中表现优异，兼容LLM式训练基础设施。

Conclusion: 展示了因果Transformer模型在实时3D感知中的潜力。

Abstract: We present STream3R, a novel approach to 3D reconstruction that reformulates
pointmap prediction as a decoder-only Transformer problem. Existing
state-of-the-art methods for multi-view reconstruction either depend on
expensive global optimization or rely on simplistic memory mechanisms that
scale poorly with sequence length. In contrast, STream3R introduces an
streaming framework that processes image sequences efficiently using causal
attention, inspired by advances in modern language modeling. By learning
geometric priors from large-scale 3D datasets, STream3R generalizes well to
diverse and challenging scenarios, including dynamic scenes where traditional
methods often fail. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently
outperforms prior work across both static and dynamic scene benchmarks.
Moreover, STream3R is inherently compatible with LLM-style training
infrastructure, enabling efficient large-scale pretraining and fine-tuning for
various downstream 3D tasks. Our results underscore the potential of causal
Transformer models for online 3D perception, paving the way for real-time 3D
understanding in streaming environments. More details can be found in our

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自监督学习在遥感领域潜力巨大，但现有方法需适应地球观测数据的独特特性。

Method: 提出了MAESTRO方法，基于掩码自编码器，优化了融合策略和目标归一化方案，引入光谱先验作为自监督信号。

Result: 在四个数据集上评估，MAESTRO在多时相动态任务中表现最佳，在单时相任务中仍具竞争力。

Conclusion: MAESTRO通过针对性优化，为遥感数据的自监督学习设定了新标杆。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning holds great promise for remote sensing, but standard
self-supervised methods must be adapted to the unique characteristics of Earth
observation data. We take a step in this direction by conducting a
comprehensive benchmark of fusion strategies and reconstruction target
normalization schemes for multimodal, multitemporal, and multispectral Earth
observation data. Based on our findings, we propose MAESTRO, a novel adaptation
of the Masked Autoencoder, featuring optimized fusion strategies and a tailored
target normalization scheme that introduces a spectral prior as a
self-supervisory signal. Evaluated on four Earth observation datasets, MAESTRO
sets a new state-of-the-art on tasks that strongly rely on multitemporal
dynamics, while remaining highly competitive on tasks dominated by a single
mono-temporal modality. Code to reproduce all our experiments is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出ESSENTIAL方法，通过结合稀疏特征存储和语义提示，解决视频类增量学习中的记忆效率与性能权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频类增量学习方法在记忆效率和性能之间存在矛盾，稀疏样本存储牺牲了时间信息，而密集样本存储则内存效率低。

Method: ESSENTIAL结合稀疏特征的片段记忆和语义提示的语义记忆，通过交叉注意力检索密集特征。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证，ESSENTIAL在显著减少内存的同时实现了优越性能。

Conclusion: ESSENTIAL有效平衡了记忆效率和性能，为视频类增量学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: In this work, we tackle the problem of video classincremental learning
(VCIL). Many existing VCIL methods mitigate catastrophic forgetting by
rehearsal training with a few temporally dense samples stored in episodic
memory, which is memory-inefficient. Alternatively, some methods store
temporally sparse samples, sacrificing essential temporal information and
thereby resulting in inferior performance. To address this trade-off between
memory-efficiency and performance, we propose EpiSodic and SEmaNTIc memory
integrAtion for video class-incremental Learning (ESSENTIAL). ESSENTIAL
consists of episodic memory for storing temporally sparse features and semantic
memory for storing general knowledge represented by learnable prompts. We
introduce a novel memory retrieval (MR) module that integrates episodic memory
and semantic prompts through cross-attention, enabling the retrieval of
temporally dense features from temporally sparse features. We rigorously
validate ESSENTIAL on diverse datasets: UCF-101, HMDB51, and
Something-Something-V2 from the TCD benchmark and UCF-101, ActivityNet, and
Kinetics-400 from the vCLIMB benchmark. Remarkably, with significantly reduced
memory, ESSENTIAL achieves favorable performance on the benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有跨域模型依赖领域特定组件和多阶段训练，限制了实用性和可扩展性。

Method: 提出Pose-in-Context (PiC)和Human-in-Context (HiC)，后者结合姿态和网格表示，扩展任务覆盖范围，并引入最大-最小相似性提示采样策略和双分支上下文注入网络架构。

Result: HiC在泛化性、数据规模和性能上优于PiC，展示了构建统一跨域3D人体运动模型的潜力。

Conclusion: HiC通过单阶段训练和统一框架，显著提升了跨域3D人体运动模型的灵活性和可扩展性。

Abstract: This paper aims to model 3D human motion across domains, where a single model
is expected to handle multiple modalities, tasks, and datasets. Existing
cross-domain models often rely on domain-specific components and multi-stage
training, which limits their practicality and scalability. To overcome these
challenges, we propose a new setting to train a unified cross-domain model
through a single process, eliminating the need for domain-specific components
and multi-stage training. We first introduce Pose-in-Context (PiC), which
leverages in-context learning to create a pose-centric cross-domain model.
While PiC generalizes across multiple pose-based tasks and datasets, it
encounters difficulties with modality diversity, prompting strategy, and
contextual dependency handling. We thus propose Human-in-Context (HiC), an
extension of PiC that broadens generalization across modalities, tasks, and
datasets. HiC combines pose and mesh representations within a unified
framework, expands task coverage, and incorporates larger-scale datasets.
Additionally, HiC introduces a max-min similarity prompt sampling strategy to
enhance generalization across diverse domains and a network architecture with
dual-branch context injection for improved handling of contextual dependencies.
Extensive experimental results show that HiC performs better than PiC in terms
of generalization, data scale, and performance across a wide range of domains.
These results demonstrate the potential of HiC for building a unified
cross-domain 3D human motion model with improved flexibility and scalability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代交互应用需要动态3D内容，但静态3D模型到动画的转换仍依赖专家干预，成为内容创作的瓶颈。

Method: 系统使用自回归变换器预测骨骼结构，结合基于注意力的架构推断皮肤权重，并通过可微分优化生成动画。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，该方法在骨骼预测准确性和皮肤质量上显著优于现有技术，并能处理多样化的3D内容。

Conclusion: Puppeteer框架高效且稳定，解决了现有方法的抖动问题，适用于专业和AI生成的3D内容。

Abstract: Modern interactive applications increasingly demand dynamic 3D content, yet
the transformation of static 3D models into animated assets constitutes a
significant bottleneck in content creation pipelines. While recent advances in
generative AI have revolutionized static 3D model creation, rigging and
animation continue to depend heavily on expert intervention. We present
Puppeteer, a comprehensive framework that addresses both automatic rigging and
animation for diverse 3D objects. Our system first predicts plausible skeletal
structures via an auto-regressive transformer that introduces a joint-based
tokenization strategy for compact representation and a hierarchical ordering
methodology with stochastic perturbation that enhances bidirectional learning
capabilities. It then infers skinning weights via an attention-based
architecture incorporating topology-aware joint attention that explicitly
encodes inter-joint relationships based on skeletal graph distances. Finally,
we complement these rigging advances with a differentiable optimization-based
animation pipeline that generates stable, high-fidelity animations while being
computationally more efficient than existing approaches. Extensive evaluations
across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in both skeletal prediction accuracy
and skinning quality. The system robustly processes diverse 3D content, ranging
from professionally designed game assets to AI-generated shapes, producing
temporally coherent animations that eliminate the jittering issues common in
existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子隐式神经表示（QINRs）在架构设计、量子力学特性利用及训练效率等方面存在挑战，本文旨在解决这些问题。

Method: QVF采用基于可学习能量流形的神经振幅编码，设计全纠缠参数化量子电路，直接在实希尔伯特空间进行量子操作，实现稳定训练。

Result: 实验表明，QVF在视觉表示准确性上优于现有量子方法和经典基线，并能应用于2D/3D场补全和形状插值。

Conclusion: QVF为量子视觉场学习提供了高效且稳定的解决方案，展示了其实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Quantum Implicit Neural Representations (QINRs) include components for
learning and execution on gate-based quantum computers. While QINRs recently
emerged as a promising new paradigm, many challenges concerning their
architecture and ansatz design, the utility of quantum-mechanical properties,
training efficiency and the interplay with classical modules remain. This paper
advances the field by introducing a new type of QINR for 2D image and 3D
geometric field learning, which we collectively refer to as Quantum Visual
Field (QVF). QVF encodes classical data into quantum statevectors using neural
amplitude encoding grounded in a learnable energy manifold, ensuring meaningful
Hilbert space embeddings. Our ansatz follows a fully entangled design of
learnable parametrised quantum circuits, with quantum (unitary) operations
performed in the real Hilbert space, resulting in numerically stable training
with fast convergence. QVF does not rely on classical post-processing -- in
contrast to the previous QINR learning approach -- and directly employs
projective measurement to extract learned signals encoded in the ansatz.
Experiments on a quantum hardware simulator demonstrate that QVF outperforms
the existing quantum approach and widely used classical foundational baselines
in terms of visual representation accuracy across various metrics and model
characteristics, such as learning of high-frequency details. We also show
applications of QVF in 2D and 3D field completion and 3D shape interpolation,
highlighting its practical potential.

<details>

Motivation: 现有ITL方法缺乏评估框架，无法验证其是否真正捕捉标注者行为模式并提供有意义的解释。

Method: 提出两个新指标：DIC（量化模型捕捉标注者倾向的能力）和BAE（评估模型解释与标注者行为的对齐程度）。

Result: 实验验证了所提评估框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架填补了ITL评估空白，为理解标注者行为提供了新工具。

Abstract: Recent works have emerged in multi-annotator learning that shift focus from
Consensus-oriented Learning (CoL), which aggregates multiple annotations into a
single ground-truth prediction, to Individual Tendency Learning (ITL), which
models annotator-specific labeling behavior patterns (i.e., tendency) to
provide explanation analysis for understanding annotator decisions. However, no
evaluation framework currently exists to assess whether ITL methods truly
capture individual tendencies and provide meaningful behavioral explanations.
To address this gap, we propose the first unified evaluation framework with two
novel metrics: (1) Difference of Inter-annotator Consistency (DIC) quantifies
how well models capture annotator tendencies by comparing predicted
inter-annotator similarity structures with ground-truth; (2) Behavior Alignment
Explainability (BAE) evaluates how well model explanations reflect annotator
behavior and decision relevance by aligning explainability-derived with
ground-truth labeling similarity structures via Multidimensional Scaling (MDS).
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed evaluation
framework.

TL;DR: OpenFPL是一个开源工具，旨在提供高精度的Fantasy Premier League球员表现预测，使用公开数据，性能媲美商业服务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 商业预测服务依赖专有数据和封闭方法，OpenFPL希望通过开源方式提供同样准确的预测，降低用户的不确定性。

Method: 基于四个赛季的公开数据（Fantasy Premier League和Understat），开发位置特定的集成模型。

Result: OpenFPL在2024-25赛季的测试中表现与商业服务相当，且在高回报球员预测上更优。

Conclusion: OpenFPL为玩家提供了长期规划和短期决策的可靠工具，推动了预测技术的民主化。

Abstract: Fantasy Premier League engages the football community in selecting the
Premier League players who will perform best from gameweek to gameweek. Access
to accurate performance forecasts gives participants an edge over competitors
by guiding expectations about player outcomes and reducing uncertainty in squad
selection. However, high-accuracy forecasts are currently limited to commercial
services whose inner workings are undisclosed and that rely on proprietary
data. This paper aims to democratize access to highly accurate forecasts of
player performance by presenting OpenFPL, an open-source Fantasy Premier League
forecasting method developed exclusively from public data. Comprising
position-specific ensemble models optimized on Fantasy Premier League and
Understat data from four previous seasons (2020-21 to 2023-24), OpenFPL
achieves accuracy comparable to a leading commercial service when tested
prospectively on data from the 2024-25 season. OpenFPL also surpasses the
commercial benchmark for high-return players ($>$ 2 points), which are most
influential for rank gains. These findings hold across one-, two-, and
three-gameweek forecast horizons, supporting long-term planning of transfers
and strategies while also informing final-day decisions.

Result: 在100个回归数据集上表现最佳，在200个分类数据集上竞争力强，优于GBDTs，并提供可解释性。

Conclusion: xRFM是一种高效且可解释的表格数据推理方法，性能优于现有技术。

Abstract: Inference from tabular data, collections of continuous and categorical
variables organized into matrices, is a foundation for modern technology and
science. Yet, in contrast to the explosive changes in the rest of AI, the best
practice for these predictive tasks has been relatively unchanged and is still
primarily based on variations of Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDTs). Very
recently, there has been renewed interest in developing state-of-the-art
methods for tabular data based on recent developments in neural networks and
feature learning methods. In this work, we introduce xRFM, an algorithm that
combines feature learning kernel machines with a tree structure to both adapt
to the local structure of the data and scale to essentially unlimited amounts
of training data.
  We show that compared to $31$ other methods, including recently introduced
tabular foundation models (TabPFNv2) and GBDTs, xRFM achieves best performance
across $100$ regression datasets and is competitive to the best methods across
$200$ classification datasets outperforming GBDTs. Additionally, xRFM provides
interpretability natively through the Average Gradient Outer Product.

Abstract: Consistent physical inactivity poses a major global health challenge. Mobile
health (mHealth) interventions, particularly Just-in-Time Adaptive
Interventions (JITAIs), offer a promising avenue for scalable, personalized
physical activity (PA) promotion. However, developing and evaluating such
interventions at scale, while integrating robust behavioral science, presents
methodological hurdles. The PEARL study was the first large-scale, four-arm
randomized controlled trial to assess a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm,
informed by health behavior change theory, to personalize the content and
timing of PA nudges via a Fitbit app.
  We enrolled and randomized 13,463 Fitbit users into four study arms: control,
random, fixed, and RL. The control arm received no nudges. The other three arms
received nudges from a bank of 155 nudges based on behavioral science
principles. The random arm received nudges selected at random. The fixed arm
received nudges based on a pre-set logic from survey responses about PA
barriers. The RL group received nudges selected by an adaptive RL algorithm. We
included 7,711 participants in primary analyses (mean age 42.1, 86.3% female,
baseline steps 5,618.2).
  We observed an increase in PA for the RL group compared to all other groups
from baseline to 1 and 2 months. The RL group had significantly increased
average daily step count at 1 month compared to all other groups: control (+296
steps, p=0.0002), random (+218 steps, p=0.005), and fixed (+238 steps,
p=0.002). At 2 months, the RL group sustained a significant increase compared
to the control group (+210 steps, p=0.0122). Generalized estimating equation
models also revealed a sustained increase in daily steps in the RL group vs.
control (+208 steps, p=0.002). These findings demonstrate the potential of a
scalable, behaviorally-informed RL approach to personalize digital health
interventions for PA.

*Jiulin Li,Ping Huang,Yexin Li,Shuo Chen,Juewen Hu,Ye Tian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MAGUS是一个模块化框架，通过解耦的认知和决策阶段统一多模态理解与生成，支持灵活的扩展和高性能的多模态转换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实多模态应用需要任意模态间的理解与生成能力，但现有方法缺乏灵活性和可扩展性。

Method: MAGUS采用两阶段设计：认知阶段通过多代理协作完成结构化理解与规划；决策阶段结合LLM推理与扩散模型生成。

Result: MAGUS在多个基准测试中表现优异，超越现有方法，甚至在MME基准上超过GPT-4o。

Conclusion: MAGUS为多模态任务提供了一种无需联合训练的高效、灵活且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Real-world multimodal applications often require any-to-any capabilities,
enabling both understanding and generation across modalities including text,
image, audio, and video. However, integrating the strengths of autoregressive
language models (LLMs) for reasoning and diffusion models for high-fidelity
generation remains challenging. Existing approaches rely on rigid pipelines or
tightly coupled architectures, limiting flexibility and scalability. We propose
MAGUS (Multi-Agent Guided Unified Multimodal System), a modular framework that
unifies multimodal understanding and generation via two decoupled phases:
Cognition and Deliberation. MAGUS enables symbolic multi-agent collaboration
within a shared textual workspace. In the Cognition phase, three
role-conditioned multimodal LLM agents - Perceiver, Planner, and Reflector -
engage in collaborative dialogue to perform structured understanding and
planning. The Deliberation phase incorporates a Growth-Aware Search mechanism
that orchestrates LLM-based reasoning and diffusion-based generation in a
mutually reinforcing manner. MAGUS supports plug-and-play extensibility,
scalable any-to-any modality conversion, and semantic alignment - all without
the need for joint training. Experiments across multiple benchmarks, including
image, video, and audio generation, as well as cross-modal instruction
following, demonstrate that MAGUS outperforms strong baselines and
state-of-the-art systems. Notably, on the MME benchmark, MAGUS surpasses the
powerful closed-source model GPT-4o.

Motivation: 需求计划者更重视预测的一致性和稳定性，而非仅追求精度提升。模型预测的剧烈波动会增加人工干预，降低对ML模型的信任。

Method: 研究了多种先进预测模型（如Chronos、DeepAR等）在公开数据集上的稳定性和精度表现。

Result: 集成模型在不显著降低精度的情况下提高了稳定性。

Conclusion: 建议未来进一步研究生产系统中预测模型的稳定性问题。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is a critical first step in generating demand plans
for supply chains. Experiments on time series models typically focus on
demonstrating improvements in forecast accuracy over existing/baseline
solutions, quantified according to some accuracy metric. There is no doubt that
forecast accuracy is important; however in production systems, demand planners
often value consistency and stability over incremental accuracy improvements.
Assuming that the inputs have not changed significantly, forecasts that vary
drastically from one planning cycle to the next require high amounts of human
intervention, which frustrates demand planners and can even cause them to lose
trust in ML forecasting models. We study model-induced stochasticity, which
quantifies the variance of a set of forecasts produced by a single model when
the set of inputs is fixed. Models with lower variance are more stable.
  Recently the forecasting community has seen significant advances in forecast
accuracy through the development of deep machine learning models for time
series forecasting. We perform a case study measuring the stability and
accuracy of state-of-the-art forecasting models (Chronos, DeepAR, PatchTST,
Temporal Fusion Transformer, TiDE, and the AutoGluon best quality ensemble) on
public data sets from the M5 competition and Favorita grocery sales. We show
that ensemble models improve stability without significantly deteriorating (or
even improving) forecast accuracy. While these results may not be surprising,
the main point of this paper is to propose the need for further study of
forecast stability for models that are being deployed in production systems.

Conclusion: 该方法为扩散模型提供了高效的约束解码方案，适用于多种形式语言场景。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising performance across diverse
domains. Many practical applications of LLMs, such as code completion and
structured data extraction, require adherence to syntactic constraints
specified by a formal language. Yet, due to their probabilistic nature, LLM
output is not guaranteed to adhere to such formal languages. Prior work has
proposed constrained decoding as a means to restrict LLM generation to
particular formal languages. However, existing works are not applicable to the
emerging paradigm of diffusion LLMs, when used in practical scenarios such as
the generation of formally correct C++ or JSON output. In this paper we address
this challenge and present the first constrained decoding method for diffusion
models, one that can handle formal languages captured by context-free grammars.
We begin by reducing constrained decoding to the more general additive
infilling problem, which asks whether a partial output can be completed to a
valid word in the target language. This problem also naturally subsumes the
previously unaddressed multi-region infilling constrained decoding. We then
reduce this problem to the task of deciding whether the intersection of the
target language and a regular language is empty and present an efficient
algorithm to solve it for context-free languages. Empirical results on various
applications, such as C++ code infilling and structured data extraction in
JSON, demonstrate that our method achieves near-perfect syntactic correctness
while consistently preserving or improving functional correctness. Importantly,
our efficiency optimizations ensure that the computational overhead remains
practical.

Conclusion: LLMs无需专门图编码器即可学习图任务，且方法具有泛化潜力。

Abstract: For large language models (LLMs), reasoning over graphs could help solve many
problems. Prior work has tried to improve LLM graph reasoning by examining how
best to serialize graphs as text and by combining GNNs and LLMs. However, the
merits of such approaches remain unclear, so we empirically answer the
following research questions: (1) Can LLMs learn to solve fundamental graph
tasks without specialized graph encoding models?, (2) Can LLMs generalize
learned solutions to unseen graph structures or tasks?, and (3) What are the
merits of competing approaches to learn graph tasks? We show that even small
LLMs can learn to solve graph tasks by training them with instructive
chain-of-thought solutions, and this training generalizes, without specialized
graph encoders, to new tasks and graph structures.

Conclusion: CAD-RL为自动化CAD建模提供了有效解决方案，并发布了ExeCAD数据集支持未来研究。

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a vital role in engineering and
manufacturing, yet current CAD workflows require extensive domain expertise and
manual modeling effort. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have
made it possible to generate code from natural language, opening new
opportunities for automating parametric 3D modeling. However, directly
translating human design intent into executable CAD code remains highly
challenging, due to the need for logical reasoning, syntactic correctness, and
numerical precision. In this work, we propose CAD-RL, a multimodal
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) guided reinforcement learning post training framework
for CAD modeling code generation. Our method combines CoT-based Cold Start with
goal-driven reinforcement learning post training using three task-specific
rewards: executability reward, geometric accuracy reward, and external
evaluation reward. To ensure stable policy learning under sparse and
high-variance reward conditions, we introduce three targeted optimization
strategies: Trust Region Stretch for improved exploration, Precision Token Loss
for enhanced dimensions parameter accuracy, and Overlong Filtering to reduce
noisy supervision. To support training and benchmarking, we release ExeCAD, a
noval dataset comprising 16,540 real-world CAD examples with paired natural
language and structured design language descriptions, executable CADQuery
scripts, and rendered 3D models. Experiments demonstrate that CAD-RL achieves
significant improvements in reasoning quality, output precision, and code
executability over existing VLMs.

Method: 利用目标模型的部分层作为行为模型生成补全，动态跳过层以减少推理成本。

Result: 在数学推理任务中提高了计算效率（tokens/sec），同时性能与基线ReFT相当。

Conclusion: Nested-ReFT在计算效率和性能之间取得了平衡，适用于大规模模型。

Abstract: Advanced reasoning in LLMs on challenging domains like mathematical reasoning
can be tackled using verifiable rewards based reinforced fine-tuning (ReFT). In
standard ReFT frameworks, a behavior model generates multiple completions with
answers per problem, for the answer to be then scored by a reward function.
While such RL post-training methods demonstrate significant performance
improvements across challenging reasoning domains, the computational cost of
generating completions during training with multiple inference steps makes the
training cost non-trivial. To address this, we draw inspiration from off-policy
RL, and speculative decoding to introduce a novel ReFT framework, dubbed
Nested-ReFT, where a subset of layers of the target model acts as the behavior
model to generate off-policy completions during training. The behavior model
configured with dynamic layer skipping per batch during training decreases the
inference cost compared to the standard ReFT frameworks. Our theoretical
analysis shows that Nested-ReFT yields unbiased gradient estimates with
controlled variance. Our empirical analysis demonstrates improved computational
efficiency measured as tokens/sec across multiple math reasoning benchmarks and
model sizes. Additionally, we explore three variants of bias mitigation to
minimize the off-policyness in the gradient updates that allows for maintaining
performance that matches the baseline ReFT performance.

Conclusion: 预训练目标与理论嵌入几何对齐能显著提升时间序列分类性能，为未来研究提供新方向。

Abstract: Deep neural networks for time series must capture complex temporal patterns,
to effectively represent dynamic data. Self- and semi-supervised learning
methods show promising results in pre-training large models, which -- when
finetuned for classification -- often outperform their counterparts trained
from scratch. Still, the choice of pretext training tasks is often heuristic
and their transferability to downstream classification is not granted, thus we
propose a novel semi-supervised pre-training strategy to enforce latent
representations that satisfy the Neural Collapse phenomenon observed in
optimally trained neural classifiers. We use a rotational equiangular tight
frame-classifier and pseudo-labeling to pre-train deep encoders with few
labeled samples. Furthermore, to effectively capture temporal dynamics while
enforcing embedding separability, we integrate generative pretext tasks with
our method, and we define a novel sequential augmentation strategy. We show
that our method significantly outperforms previous pretext tasks when applied
to LSTMs, transformers, and state-space models on three multivariate time
series classification datasets. These results highlight the benefit of aligning
pre-training objectives with theoretically grounded embedding geometry.

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和ImageNet-200上表现优异，AUROC和FPR95指标优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅高效且可扩展，还能通过反事实解释增强结果的可解释性。

Abstract: Accurate and explainable out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is required to
use machine learning systems safely. Previous work has shown that feature
distance to decision boundaries can be used to identify OOD data effectively.
In this paper, we build on this intuition and propose a post-hoc OOD detection
method that, given an input, calculates the distance to decision boundaries by
leveraging counterfactual explanations. Since computing explanations can be
expensive for large architectures, we also propose strategies to improve
scalability by computing counterfactuals directly in embedding space.
Crucially, as the method employs counterfactual explanations, we can seamlessly
use them to help interpret the results of our detector. We show that our method
is in line with the state of the art on CIFAR-10, achieving 93.50% AUROC and
25.80% FPR95. Our method outperforms these methods on CIFAR-100 with 97.05%
AUROC and 13.79% FPR95 and on ImageNet-200 with 92.55% AUROC and 33.55% FPR95

Abstract: Mixture models have attracted significant attention due to practical
effectiveness and comprehensive theoretical foundations. A persisting challenge
is model misspecification, which occurs when the model to be fitted has more
mixture components than those in the data distribution. In this paper, we
develop a theoretical understanding of the Expectation-Maximization (EM)
algorithm's behavior in the context of targeted model misspecification for
overspecified two-component Mixed Linear Regression (2MLR) with unknown
$d$-dimensional regression parameters and mixing weights. In Theorem 5.1 at the
population level, with an unbalanced initial guess for mixing weights, we
establish linear convergence of regression parameters in $O(\log(1/\epsilon))$
steps. Conversely, with a balanced initial guess for mixing weights, we observe
sublinear convergence in $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ steps to achieve the
$\epsilon$-accuracy at Euclidean distance. In Theorem 6.1 at the finite-sample
level, for mixtures with sufficiently unbalanced fixed mixing weights, we
demonstrate a statistical accuracy of $O((d/n)^{1/2})$, whereas for those with
sufficiently balanced fixed mixing weights, the accuracy is $O((d/n)^{1/4})$
given $n$ data samples. Furthermore, we underscore the connection between our
population level and finite-sample level results: by setting the desired final
accuracy $\epsilon$ in Theorem 5.1 to match that in Theorem 6.1 at the
finite-sample level, namely letting $\epsilon = O((d/n)^{1/2})$ for
sufficiently unbalanced fixed mixing weights and $\epsilon = O((d/n)^{1/4})$
for sufficiently balanced fixed mixing weights, we intuitively derive iteration
complexity bounds $O(\log (1/\epsilon))=O(\log (n/d))$ and
$O(\epsilon^{-2})=O((n/d)^{1/2})$ at the finite-sample level for sufficiently
unbalanced and balanced initial mixing weights. We further extend our analysis
in overspecified setting to low SNR regime.

Conclusion: 通过基准测试引导AI发展，将评估转化为学习，强调测试任务的新颖性对衡量推理模型泛化能力的重要性。

Abstract: Evaluation of reasoning language models gained importance after it was
observed that they can combine their existing capabilities into novel traces of
intermediate steps before task completion and that the traces can sometimes
help them to generalize better than past models. As reasoning becomes the next
scaling dimension of large language models, careful study of their capabilities
in critical tasks is needed. We show that better performance is not always
caused by test-time algorithmic improvements or model sizes but also by using
impactful benchmarks as curricula for learning. We call this benchmark-driven
selection of AI and show its effects on DeepSeek-R1 using our sequential
decision-making problem from Humanity's Last Exam. Steering development of AI
by impactful benchmarks trades evaluation for learning and makes novelty of
test tasks key for measuring generalization capabilities of reasoning models.
Consequently, some benchmarks could be seen as curricula for training rather
than unseen test sets.

Abstract: Monitoring cattle health and optimizing yield are key challenges faced by
dairy farmers due to difficulties in tracking all animals on the farm. This
work aims to showcase modern data-driven farming practices based on explainable
machine learning(ML) methods that explain the activity and behaviour of dairy
cattle (cows). Continuous data collection of 3-axis accelerometer sensors and
usage of robust ML methodologies and algorithms, provide farmers and
researchers with actionable information on cattle activity, allowing farmers to
make informed decisions and incorporate sustainable practices. This study
utilizes Bluetooth-based Internet of Things (IoT) devices and 4G networks for
seamless data transmission, immediate analysis, inference generation, and
explains the models performance with explainability frameworks. Special
emphasis is put on the pre-processing of the accelerometers time series data,
including the extraction of statistical characteristics, signal processing
techniques, and lag-based features using the sliding window technique. Various
hyperparameter-optimized ML models are evaluated across varying window lengths
for activity classification. The k-nearest neighbour Classifier achieved the
best performance, with AUC of mean 0.98 and standard deviation of 0.0026 on the
training set and 0.99 on testing set). In order to ensure transparency,
Explainable AI based frameworks such as SHAP is used to interpret feature
importance that can be understood and used by practitioners. A detailed
comparison of the important features, along with the stability analysis of
selected features, supports development of explainable and practical ML models
for sustainable livestock management.

Abstract: The transnational ivory trade continues to drive the decline of elephant
populations across Africa, and trafficking networks remain difficult to
disrupt. Tusks seized by law enforcement officials carry forensic information
on the traffickers responsible for their export, including DNA evidence and
handwritten markings made by traffickers. For 20 years, analyses of tusk DNA
have identified where elephants were poached and established connections among
shipments of ivory. While the links established using genetic evidence are
extremely conclusive, genetic data is expensive and sometimes impossible to
obtain. But though handwritten markings are easy to photograph, they are rarely
documented or analyzed. Here, we present an AI-driven pipeline for extracting
and analyzing handwritten markings on seized elephant tusks, offering a novel,
scalable, and low-cost source of forensic evidence. Having collected 6,085
photographs from eight large seizures of ivory over a 6-year period
(2014-2019), we used an object detection model to extract over 17,000
individual markings, which were then labeled and described using
state-of-the-art AI tools. We identified 184 recurring "signature markings"
that connect the tusks on which they appear. 20 signature markings were
observed in multiple seizures, establishing forensic links between these
seizures through traffickers involved in both shipments. This work complements
other investigative techniques by filling in gaps where other data sources are
unavailable. The study demonstrates the transformative potential of AI in
wildlife forensics and highlights practical steps for integrating handwriting
analysis into efforts to disrupt organized wildlife crime.

Result: D-Wave采样覆盖更多局部谷，但与Gibbs采样重叠度高，未显著提升采样质量。

Conclusion: 量子退火器在RBM采样中潜力有限，但结合经典方法可能有改进空间。

Abstract: A local-valley (LV) centered approach to assessing the quality of sampling
from Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) was applied to the latest generation
of the D-Wave quantum annealer. D-Wave and Gibbs samples from a classically
trained RBM were obtained at conditions relevant to the
contrastive-divergence-based RBM learning. The samples were compared for the
number of the LVs to which they belonged and the energy of the corresponding
local minima. No significant (desirable) increase in the number of the LVs has
been achieved by decreasing the D-Wave annealing time. At any training epoch,
the states sampled by the D-Wave belonged to a somewhat higher number of LVs
than in the Gibbs sampling. However, many of those LVs found by the two
techniques differed. For high-probability sampled states, the two techniques
were (unfavorably) less complementary and more overlapping. Nevertheless, many
potentially "important" local minima, i.e., those having intermediate, even if
not high, probability values, were found by only one of the two sampling
techniques while missed by the other. The two techniques overlapped less at
later than earlier training epochs, which is precisely the stage of the
training when modest improvements to the sampling quality could make meaningful
differences for the RBM trainability. The results of this work may explain the
failure of previous investigations to achieve substantial (or any) improvement
when using D-Wave-based sampling. However, the results reveal some potential
for improvement, e.g., using a combined classical-quantum approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肝硬化患者AKI发生率高且预后差，现有预测工具准确性不足，需开发更精准且符合ICU工作流程的模型。

Method: 回顾性分析MIMIC-IV数据库，提取48小时内实验室和生理变量，通过预处理、特征选择和算法训练（包括LightGBM等）构建模型。

Result: LightGBM模型表现最优（AUROC 0.808），关键预测因子包括凝血时间、pH值和pO2等，与AKI机制一致。

Conclusion: 该模型能准确早期预测AKI风险，高阴性预测值支持低风险患者管理，可解释性增强临床信任，需进一步外部验证。

Abstract: Background: Cirrhosis is a progressive liver disease with high mortality and
frequent complications, notably acute kidney injury (AKI), which occurs in up
to 50% of hospitalized patients and worsens outcomes. AKI stems from complex
hemodynamic, inflammatory, and metabolic changes, making early detection
essential. Many predictive tools lack accuracy, interpretability, and alignment
with intensive care unit (ICU) workflows. This study developed an interpretable
machine learning model for early AKI prediction in critically ill patients with
cirrhosis.
  Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of the MIMIC-IV v2.2 database,
identifying 1240 adult ICU patients with cirrhosis and excluding those with ICU
stays under 48 hours or missing key data. Laboratory and physiological
variables from the first 48 hours were extracted. The pipeline included
preprocessing, missingness filtering, LASSO feature selection, and SMOTE class
balancing. Six algorithms-LightGBM, CatBoost, XGBoost, logistic regression,
naive Bayes, and neural networks-were trained and evaluated using AUROC,
accuracy, F1-score, sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values.
  Results: LightGBM achieved the best performance (AUROC 0.808, 95% CI
0.741-0.856; accuracy 0.704; NPV 0.911). Key predictors included prolonged
partial thromboplastin time, absence of outside-facility 20G placement, low pH,
and altered pO2, consistent with known cirrhosis-AKI mechanisms and suggesting
actionable targets.
  Conclusion: The LightGBM-based model enables accurate early AKI risk
stratification in ICU patients with cirrhosis using routine clinical variables.
Its high negative predictive value supports safe de-escalation for low-risk
patients, and interpretability fosters clinician trust and targeted prevention.
External validation and integration into electronic health record systems are
warranted.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a powerful capability of
transformer-based language models, enabling them to perform tasks by
conditioning on a small number of examples presented at inference time, without
any parameter updates. Prior work has shown that transformers can generalize
over simple function classes like linear functions, decision trees, even neural
networks, purely from context, focusing on numerical or symbolic reasoning over
underlying well-structured functions. Instead, we propose a novel application
of ICL into the domain of cryptographic function learning, specifically
focusing on ciphers such as mono-alphabetic substitution and Vigen\`ere
ciphers, two classes of private-key encryption schemes. These ciphers involve a
fixed but hidden bijective mapping between plain text and cipher text
characters. Given a small set of (cipher text, plain text) pairs, the goal is
for the model to infer the underlying substitution and decode a new cipher text
word. This setting poses a structured inference challenge, which is well-suited
for evaluating the inductive biases and generalization capabilities of
transformers under the ICL paradigm. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需重新训练的Transformer后门攻击方法HPMI，通过剪枝和注入恶意头实现高攻击成功率，同时保持模型清洁精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Transformer后门攻击方法依赖重新训练或修改架构，资源消耗大且侵入性强，需一种更高效隐蔽的方法。

Method: HPMI通过剪枝最不重要的头并注入预训练的恶意头，无需重新训练或修改架构。

Result: 实验显示HPMI攻击成功率达99.55%，绕过四种防御机制，且对清洁精度影响极小。

Conclusion: HPMI是一种高效隐蔽的后门攻击方法，优于现有依赖重新训练的攻击。

Abstract: Transformer models have demonstrated exceptional performance and have become
indispensable in computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP)
tasks. However, recent studies reveal that transformers are susceptible to
backdoor attacks. Prior backdoor attack methods typically rely on retraining
with clean data or altering the model architecture, both of which can be
resource-intensive and intrusive. In this paper, we propose Head-wise Pruning
and Malicious Injection (HPMI), a novel retraining-free backdoor attack on
transformers that does not alter the model's architecture. Our approach
requires only a small subset of the original data and basic knowledge of the
model architecture, eliminating the need for retraining the target transformer.
Technically, HPMI works by pruning the least important head and injecting a
pre-trained malicious head to establish the backdoor. We provide a rigorous
theoretical justification demonstrating that the implanted backdoor resists
detection and removal by state-of-the-art defense techniques, under reasonable
assumptions. Experimental evaluations across multiple datasets further validate
the effectiveness of HPMI, showing that it 1) incurs negligible clean accuracy
loss, 2) achieves at least 99.55% attack success rate, and 3) bypasses four
advanced defense mechanisms. Additionally, relative to state-of-the-art
retraining-dependent attacks, HPMI achieves greater concealment and robustness
against diverse defense strategies, while maintaining minimal impact on clean
accuracy.

Conclusion: Max Min Kantorovich型指数神经网络算子在函数近似中表现出良好的收敛性和实用性。

Abstract: In this current work, we propose a Max Min approach for approximating
functions using exponential neural network operators. We extend this framework
to develop the Max Min Kantorovich-type exponential neural network operators
and investigate their approximation properties. We study both pointwise and
uniform convergence for univariate functions. To analyze the order of
convergence, we use the logarithmic modulus of continuity and estimate the
corresponding rate of convergence. Furthermore, we examine the convergence
behavior of the Max Min Kantorovich type exponential neural network operators
within the Orlicz space setting. We provide some graphical representations to
illustrate the approximation error of the function through suitable kernel and
sigmoidal activation functions.

Result: 在多个关键指标上优于传统方法，包括资源利用率、调度延迟、策略收敛速度和系统稳定性。

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂依赖关系和高并发场景下表现出色，适用于大规模调度环境。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of high resource dynamism and scheduling
complexity in cloud-native database systems. It proposes an adaptive resource
orchestration method based on multi-agent reinforcement learning. The method
introduces a heterogeneous role-based agent modeling mechanism. This allows
different resource entities, such as compute nodes, storage nodes, and
schedulers, to adopt distinct policy representations. These agents are better
able to reflect diverse functional responsibilities and local environmental
characteristics within the system. A reward-shaping mechanism is designed to
integrate local observations with global feedback. This helps mitigate policy
learning bias caused by incomplete state observations. By combining real-time
local performance signals with global system value estimation, the mechanism
improves coordination among agents and enhances policy convergence stability. A
unified multi-agent training framework is developed and evaluated on a
representative production scheduling dataset. Experimental results show that
the proposed method outperforms traditional approaches across multiple key
metrics. These include resource utilization, scheduling latency, policy
convergence speed, system stability, and fairness. The results demonstrate
strong generalization and practical utility. Across various experimental
scenarios, the method proves effective in handling orchestration tasks with
high concurrency, high-dimensional state spaces, and complex dependency
relationships. This confirms its advantages in real-world, large-scale
scheduling environments.

Conclusion: 该方法在云计算环境中具有智能资源监控和异常诊断的实际潜力。

Abstract: This paper proposes an anomaly detection method based on federated learning
to address key challenges in multi-tenant cloud environments, including data
privacy leakage, heterogeneous resource behavior, and the limitations of
centralized modeling. The method establishes a federated training framework
involving multiple tenants. Each tenant trains the model locally using private
resource usage data. Through parameter aggregation, a global model is
optimized, enabling cross-tenant collaborative anomaly detection while
preserving data privacy. To improve adaptability to diverse resource usage
patterns, a personalized parameter adjustment mechanism is introduced. This
allows the model to retain tenant-specific feature representations while
sharing global knowledge. In the model output stage, the Mahalanobis distance
is used to compute anomaly scores. This enhances both the accuracy and
stability of anomaly detection. The experiments use real telemetry data from a
cloud platform to construct a simulated multi-tenant environment. The study
evaluates the model's performance under varying participation rates and noise
injection levels. These comparisons demonstrate the proposed method's
robustness and detection accuracy. Experimental results show that the proposed
method outperforms existing mainstream models across key metrics such as
Precision, Recall, and F1-Score. It also maintains stable performance in
various complex scenarios. These findings highlight the method's practical
potential for intelligent resource monitoring and anomaly diagnosis in cloud
computing environments.

Motivation: 现有在线学习方法无法有效利用重复偏移，而基于模型池的方法难以捕捉单个源组件，导致适应效果不佳。

Method: 方法分为两步：离线通过EM算法分解源组件并训练预测模型，在线通过凸优化调整混合权重。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多个真实回归数据集上表现优异，累计测试损失降低高达67.4%。

Conclusion: 通过理论推导和实验验证，该方法充分利用偏移特性，实现了优于现有方法的适应性能。

Abstract: This paper addresses source component shift adaptation, aiming to update
predictions adapting to source component shifts for incoming data streams based
on past training data. Existing online learning methods often fail to utilize
recurring shifts effectively, while model-pool-based methods struggle to
capture individual source components, leading to poor adaptation. In this
paper, we propose a source component shift adaptation method via an offline
decomposition and online mixing approach. We theoretically identify that the
problem can be divided into two subproblems: offline source component
decomposition and online mixing weight adaptation. Based on this, our method
first determines prediction models, each of which learns a source component
solely based on past training data offline through the EM algorithm. Then, it
updates the mixing weight of the prediction models for precise prediction
through online convex optimization. Thanks to our theoretical derivation, our
method fully leverages the characteristics of the shifts, achieving superior
adaptation performance over existing methods. Experiments conducted on various
real-world regression datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms
baselines, reducing the cumulative test loss by up to 67.4%.

Motivation: 帕金森病的药物治疗管理因疾病进展和反应异质性而复杂，现有方法缺乏系统性预测且忽视预测不确定性，影响临床信任和实用性。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：首先识别需要药物调整的患者，然后预测左旋多巴等效日剂量调整。利用电子健康记录数据，解决数据零膨胀问题。

Result: 框架在保持边际覆盖率的同时，减少了预测区间长度，提供了短期精确预测和长期宽范围预测。

Conclusion: 通过量化不确定性，该框架支持基于证据的左旋多巴剂量决策，优化症状控制并减少副作用，提高生活质量。

Abstract: Parkinson's Disease (PD) medication management presents unique challenges due
to heterogeneous disease progression and treatment response. Neurologists must
balance symptom control with optimal dopaminergic dosing based on functional
disability while minimizing side effects. This balance is crucial as inadequate
or abrupt changes can cause levodopa-induced dyskinesia, wearing off, and
neuropsychiatric effects, significantly reducing quality of life. Current
approaches rely on trial-and-error decisions without systematic predictive
methods. Despite machine learning advances, clinical adoption remains limited
due to reliance on point predictions that do not account for prediction
uncertainty, undermining clinical trust and utility. Clinicians require not
only predictions of future medication needs but also reliable confidence
measures. Without quantified uncertainty, adjustments risk premature escalation
to maximum doses or prolonged inadequate symptom control. We developed a
conformal prediction framework anticipating medication needs up to two years in
advance with reliable prediction intervals and statistical guarantees. Our
approach addresses zero-inflation in PD inpatient data, where patients maintain
stable medication regimens between visits. Using electronic health records from
631 inpatient admissions at University of Florida Health (2011-2021), our
two-stage approach identifies patients likely to need medication changes, then
predicts required levodopa equivalent daily dose adjustments. Our framework
achieved marginal coverage while reducing prediction interval lengths compared
to traditional approaches, providing precise predictions for short-term
planning and wider ranges for long-term forecasting. By quantifying
uncertainty, our approach enables evidence-based decisions about levodopa
dosing, optimizing symptom control while minimizing side effects and improving
life quality.

Motivation: 视觉刺激到神经响应的映射是一对多的关系，现有方法难以同时捕捉生物变异性和功能一致性。

Method: SynBrain包含BrainVAE（通过概率学习建模神经表征）和语义到神经映射器（将视觉语义投射到神经响应流形）。

Result: SynBrain在视觉到fMRI编码性能上超越现有方法，适应新受试者能力强，并能生成高质量fMRI信号。

Conclusion: SynBrain不仅提升了性能，还揭示了跨试验和受试者的功能一致性，具有生物可解释性。

Abstract: Deciphering how visual stimuli are transformed into cortical responses is a
fundamental challenge in computational neuroscience. This visual-to-neural
mapping is inherently a one-to-many relationship, as identical visual inputs
reliably evoke variable hemodynamic responses across trials, contexts, and
subjects. However, existing deterministic methods struggle to simultaneously
model this biological variability while capturing the underlying functional
consistency that encodes stimulus information. To address these limitations, we
propose SynBrain, a generative framework that simulates the transformation from
visual semantics to neural responses in a probabilistic and biologically
interpretable manner. SynBrain introduces two key components: (i) BrainVAE
models neural representations as continuous probability distributions via
probabilistic learning while maintaining functional consistency through visual
semantic constraints; (ii) A Semantic-to-Neural Mapper acts as a semantic
transmission pathway, projecting visual semantics into the neural response
manifold to facilitate high-fidelity fMRI synthesis. Experimental results
demonstrate that SynBrain surpasses state-of-the-art methods in
subject-specific visual-to-fMRI encoding performance. Furthermore, SynBrain
adapts efficiently to new subjects with few-shot data and synthesizes
high-quality fMRI signals that are effective in improving data-limited
fMRI-to-image decoding performance. Beyond that, SynBrain reveals functional
consistency across trials and subjects, with synthesized signals capturing
interpretable patterns shaped by biological neural variability. The code will
be made publicly available.

Result: 在皮肤病、胸部X光和视网膜OCT数据集上，FedKEI优于现有方法，适应新疾病能力更强。

Conclusion: FedKEI通过知识增强的初始化，显著提升了联邦学习在医疗任务中的适应性和效率。

Abstract: In healthcare, federated learning (FL) is a widely adopted framework that
enables privacy-preserving collaboration among medical institutions. With large
foundation models (FMs) demonstrating impressive capabilities, using FMs in FL
through cost-efficient adapter tuning has become a popular approach. Given the
rapidly evolving healthcare environment, it is crucial for individual clients
to quickly adapt to new tasks or diseases by tuning adapters while drawing upon
past experiences. In this work, we introduce Federated Knowledge-Enhanced
Initialization (FedKEI), a novel framework that leverages cross-client and
cross-task transfer from past knowledge to generate informed initializations
for learning new tasks with adapters. FedKEI begins with a global clustering
process at the server to generalize knowledge across tasks, followed by the
optimization of aggregation weights across clusters (inter-cluster weights) and
within each cluster (intra-cluster weights) to personalize knowledge transfer
for each new task. To facilitate more effective learning of the inter- and
intra-cluster weights, we adopt a bi-level optimization scheme that
collaboratively learns the global intra-cluster weights across clients and
optimizes the local inter-cluster weights toward each client's task objective.
Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets of different modalities,
including dermatology, chest X-rays, and retinal OCT, demonstrate FedKEI's
advantage in adapting to new diseases compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: CLIP-Fed有效解决了异构数据分布下的后门防御问题，显著提升了防御效果和模型性能。

Abstract: Existing backdoor defense methods in Federated Learning (FL) rely on the
assumption of homogeneous client data distributions or the availability of a
clean serve dataset, which limits the practicality and effectiveness. Defending
against backdoor attacks under heterogeneous client data distributions while
preserving model performance remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we
propose a FL backdoor defense framework named CLIP-Fed, which leverages the
zero-shot learning capabilities of vision-language pre-training models. By
integrating both pre-aggregation and post-aggregation defense strategies,
CLIP-Fed overcomes the limitations of Non-IID imposed on defense effectiveness.
To address privacy concerns and enhance the coverage of the dataset against
diverse triggers, we construct and augment the server dataset using the
multimodal large language model and frequency analysis without any client
samples. To address class prototype deviations caused by backdoor samples and
eliminate the correlation between trigger patterns and target labels, CLIP-Fed
aligns the knowledge of the global model and CLIP on the augmented dataset
using prototype contrastive loss and Kullback-Leibler divergence. Extensive
experiments on representative datasets validate the effectiveness of CLIP-Fed.
Compared to state-of-the-art methods, CLIP-Fed achieves an average reduction in
ASR, i.e., 2.03\% on CIFAR-10 and 1.35\% on CIFAR-10-LT, while improving
average MA by 7.92\% and 0.48\%, respectively.

Motivation: 传统公平聚类方法可能导致不理想的结果，因此需要一种更注重群体效用的福利中心方法。

Method: 基于距离和比例代表建模群体效用，提出Rawlsian和Utilitarian两种优化目标，并设计新算法。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上的实验表明，新方法显著优于现有公平聚类基线。

Conclusion: 福利中心的公平聚类方法更有效，且提出的算法具有理论保证和实际优势。

Abstract: Fair clustering has traditionally focused on ensuring equitable group
representation or equalizing group-specific clustering costs. However,
Dickerson et al. (2025) recently showed that these fairness notions may yield
undesirable or unintuitive clustering outcomes and advocated for a
welfare-centric clustering approach that models the utilities of the groups. In
this work, we model group utilities based on both distances and proportional
representation and formalize two optimization objectives based on
welfare-centric clustering: the Rawlsian (Egalitarian) objective and the
Utilitarian objective. We introduce novel algorithms for both objectives and
prove theoretical guarantees for them. Empirical evaluations on multiple
real-world datasets demonstrate that our methods significantly outperform
existing fair clustering baselines.

Conclusion: 该框架在IoMT环境中具有强适用性，能高效检测零日攻击且无需新数据集。

Abstract: The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is driving a healthcare revolution but
remains vulnerable to cyberattacks such as denial of service, ransomware, data
hijacking, and spoofing. These networks comprise resource constrained,
heterogeneous devices (e.g., wearable sensors, smart pills, implantables),
making traditional centralized Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) unsuitable
due to response delays, privacy risks, and added vulnerabilities. Centralized
IDSs require all sensors to transmit data to a central server, causing delays
or network disruptions in dense environments. Running IDSs locally on IoMT
devices is often infeasible due to limited computation, and even lightweight
IDS components remain at risk if updated models are delayed leaving them
exposed to zero-day attacks that threaten patient health and data security. We
propose a multi level IoMT IDS framework capable of detecting zero day attacks
and distinguishing between known and unknown threats. The first layer (near
Edge) filters traffic at a coarse level (attack or not) using meta-learning or
One Class Classification (OCC) with the usfAD algorithm. Subsequent layers (far
Edge, Cloud) identify attack type and novelty. Experiments on the CICIoMT2024
dataset show 99.77 percentage accuracy and 97.8 percentage F1-score. The first
layer detects zero-day attacks with high accuracy without needing new datasets,
ensuring strong applicability in IoMT environments. Additionally, the
meta-learning approach achieves high.

Abstract: Semantic communication aims to convey meaning rather than bit-perfect
reproduction, representing a paradigm shift from traditional communication.
This paper investigates distribution learning in semantic communication where
receivers must infer the underlying meaning distribution through sequential
observations. While semantic communication traditionally optimizes individual
meaning transmission, we establish fundamental conditions for learning source
statistics when priors are unknown. We prove that learnability requires full
rank of the effective transmission matrix, characterize the convergence rate of
distribution estimation, and quantify how estimation errors translate to
semantic distortion. Our analysis reveals a fundamental trade-off: encoding
schemes optimized for immediate semantic performance often sacrifice long-term
learnability. Experiments on CIFAR-10 validate our theoretical framework,
demonstrating that system conditioning critically impacts both learning rate
and achievable performance. These results provide the first rigorous
characterization of statistical learning in semantic communication and offer
design principles for systems that balance immediate performance with
adaptation capability.

Motivation: Mamba模型在序列数据处理中表现出色，但缺乏针对边缘设备的硬件加速框架，eMamba旨在填补这一空白。

Conclusion: eMamba为Mamba模型在边缘设备上的高效部署提供了可行方案，兼具性能和资源效率。

Abstract: State Space Model (SSM)-based machine learning architectures have recently
gained significant attention for processing sequential data. Mamba, a recent
sequence-to-sequence SSM, offers competitive accuracy with superior
computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art transformer models. While
this advantage makes Mamba particularly promising for resource-constrained edge
devices, no hardware acceleration frameworks are currently optimized for
deploying it in such environments. This paper presents eMamba, a comprehensive
end-to-end hardware acceleration framework explicitly designed for deploying
Mamba models on edge platforms. eMamba maximizes computational efficiency by
replacing complex normalization layers with lightweight hardware-aware
alternatives and approximating expensive operations, such as SiLU activation
and exponentiation, considering the target applications. Then, it performs an
approximation-aware neural architecture search (NAS) to tune the learnable
parameters used during approximation. Evaluations with Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10,
and MARS, an open-source human pose estimation dataset, show eMamba achieves
comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art techniques using 1.63-19.9$\times$
fewer parameters. In addition, it generalizes well to large-scale natural
language tasks, demonstrating stable perplexity across varying sequence lengths
on the WikiText2 dataset. We also quantize and implement the entire eMamba
pipeline on an AMD ZCU102 FPGA and ASIC using GlobalFoundries (GF) 22 nm
technology. Experimental results show 4.95-5.62$\times$ lower latency and
2.22-9.95$\times$ higher throughput, with 4.77$\times$ smaller area,
9.84$\times$ lower power, and 48.6$\times$ lower energy consumption than
baseline solutions while maintaining competitive accuracy.

Abstract: Although LLM inference has emerged as a critical workload for many downstream
applications, efficiently inferring LLMs is challenging due to the substantial
memory footprint and bandwidth requirements. In parallel, compute capabilities
have steadily outpaced both memory capacity and bandwidth over the last few
decades, a trend that remains evident in modern GPU hardware and exacerbates
the challenge of LLM inference. As such, new algorithms are emerging that trade
increased computation for reduced memory operations. To that end, we present
XQuant, which takes advantage of this trend, enabling an order-of-magnitude
reduction in memory consumption through low-bit quantization with substantial
accuracy benefits relative to state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods.
We accomplish this by quantizing and caching the layer input activations X,
instead of using standard KV caching, and then rematerializing the Keys and
Values on-the-fly during inference. This results in an immediate 2$\times$
memory savings compared to KV caching. By applying XQuant, we achieve up to
$\sim 7.7\times$ memory savings with $<0.1$ perplexity degradation compared to
the FP16 baseline. Furthermore, our approach leverages the fact that X values
are similar across layers. Building on this observation, we introduce
XQuant-CL, which exploits the cross-layer similarity in the X embeddings for
extreme compression. Across different models, XQuant-CL attains up to
10$\times$ memory savings relative to the FP16 baseline with only 0.01
perplexity degradation, and 12.5$\times$ memory savings with only $0.1$
perplexity degradation. XQuant exploits the rapidly increasing compute
capabilities of hardware platforms to eliminate the memory bottleneck, while
surpassing state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods and achieving
near-FP16 accuracy across a wide range of models.

TL;DR: SC2Arena是一个支持所有可玩种族和低级动作空间的StarCraft II基准测试，结合StarEvolve框架，通过分层规划和自我修正提升AI战略规划能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试未能完全捕捉StarCraft II的复杂性，如完整游戏上下文和多样化动作空间，因此需要更全面的评估工具。

Method: 提出SC2Arena基准测试和StarEvolve分层框架，包括Planner-Executor-Verifier结构和高质量数据微调。

Result: 实验表明StarEvolve在战略规划上表现优异，SC2Arena为开发通用智能体提供了新见解。

Conclusion: SC2Arena和StarEvolve填补了现有基准的不足，推动了AI在复杂决策中的发展。

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) in complex decision-making is
essential for advancing AI's ability for strategic planning and real-time
adaptation. However, existing benchmarks for tasks like StarCraft II fail to
capture the game's full complexity, such as its complete game context, diverse
action spaces, and all playable races. To address this gap, we present
SC2Arena, a benchmark that fully supports all playable races, low-level action
spaces, and optimizes text-based observations to tackle spatial reasoning
challenges. Complementing this, we introduce StarEvolve, a hierarchical
framework that integrates strategic planning with tactical execution, featuring
iterative self-correction and continuous improvement via fine-tuning on
high-quality gameplay data. Its key components include a
Planner-Executor-Verifier structure to break down gameplay, and a scoring
system for selecting high-quality training samples. Comprehensive analysis
using SC2Arena provides valuable insights into developing generalist agents
that were not possible with previous benchmarks. Experimental results also
demonstrate that our proposed StarEvolve achieves superior performance in
strategic planning. Our code, environment, and algorithms are publicly
available.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文分析了SAM在张量化和尺度不变模型中的行为，提出了Norm Deviation概念，并基于此设计了DAS方法，实验表明DAS在性能和计算效率上优于SAM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索SAM在更一般的张量化或尺度不变模型中的行为，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 利用尺度不变性分析SAM的范数动态，提出Norm Deviation概念，并通过梯度流分析其演化。基于此设计DAS方法，显式模拟SAM的隐式正则化行为。

Result: DAS在张量补全、噪声训练、模型压缩和参数高效微调等任务中表现优于或与SAM相当，且计算开销更低。

Conclusion: DAS通过显式控制Norm Deviation，有效模拟了SAM的隐式正则化，提供了更高效的优化方案。

Abstract: Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) has been proven to be an effective
optimization technique for improving generalization in overparameterized
models. While prior works have explored the implicit regularization of SAM in
simple two-core scale-invariant settings, its behavior in more general
tensorized or scale-invariant models remains underexplored. In this work, we
leverage scale-invariance to analyze the norm dynamics of SAM in general
tensorized models. We introduce the notion of \emph{Norm Deviation} as a global
measure of core norm imbalance, and derive its evolution under SAM using
gradient flow analysis. We show that SAM's implicit control of Norm Deviation
is governed by the covariance between core norms and their gradient magnitudes.
Motivated by these findings, we propose a simple yet effective method,
\emph{Deviation-Aware Scaling (DAS)}, which explicitly mimics this
regularization behavior by scaling core norms in a data-adaptive manner. Our
experiments across tensor completion, noisy training, model compression, and
parameter-efficient fine-tuning confirm that DAS achieves competitive or
improved performance over SAM, while offering reduced computational overhead.

*Asiful Arefeen,Shovito Barua Soumma,Hassan Ghasemzadeh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RealAC是一个领域无关的框架，用于生成现实且可操作的反事实解释，通过自动保持特征间依赖关系和用户约束，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有反事实解释方法通常依赖手工约束或领域知识，难以捕捉复杂非线性关系，且缺乏用户定制能力。

Method: RealAC通过对齐事实与反事实实例的特征联合分布，自动保持特征间依赖，并允许用户冻结不希望更改的属性。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，RealAC在因果性、依赖保持和现实性指标上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RealAC提供了一种因果感知且用户中心的反事实生成解决方案。

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations provide human-understandable reasoning for
AI-made decisions by describing minimal changes to input features that would
alter a model's prediction. To be truly useful in practice, such explanations
must be realistic and feasible -- they should respect both the underlying data
distribution and user-defined feasibility constraints. Existing approaches
often enforce inter-feature dependencies through rigid, hand-crafted
constraints or domain-specific knowledge, which limits their generalizability
and ability to capture complex, nonlinear relations inherent in data. Moreover,
they rarely accommodate user-specified preferences and suggest explanations
that are causally implausible or infeasible to act upon. We introduce RealAC, a
domain-agnostic framework for generating realistic and actionable
counterfactuals. RealAC automatically preserves complex inter-feature
dependencies without relying on explicit domain knowledge -- by aligning the
joint distributions of feature pairs between factual and counterfactual
instances. The framework also allows end-users to ``freeze'' attributes they
cannot or do not wish to change by suppressing change in frozen features during
optimization. Evaluations on three synthetic and two real datasets demonstrate
that RealAC balances realism with actionability. Our method outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines and Large Language Model-based counterfactual
generation techniques in causal edge score, dependency preservation score, and
IM1 realism metric and offers a solution for causality-aware and user-centric
counterfactual generation.

TL;DR: X-Node是一种自解释图神经网络框架，通过生成每个节点的解释来提高透明度和可信度，同时保持分类准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在临床等高风险应用中，图神经网络（GNNs）的决策过程缺乏可解释性，限制了其可信度。现有解释技术多为事后和全局性，无法提供节点级别的解释。

Method: X-Node为每个节点构建结构化上下文向量，包含可解释的局部拓扑特征，并通过轻量级Reasoner模块生成解释向量，用于重建嵌入、生成自然语言解释并反馈到消息传递中。

Result: 在MedMNIST和MorphoMNIST数据集上，X-Node保持了与GCN、GAT和GIN相当的分类准确性，同时提供了节点级别的忠实解释。

Conclusion: X-Node为GNN提供了一种高效的自解释机制，适用于需要高透明度的应用场景。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art results in
computer vision and medical image classification tasks by capturing structural
dependencies across data instances. However, their decision-making remains
largely opaque, limiting their trustworthiness in high-stakes clinical
applications where interpretability is essential. Existing explainability
techniques for GNNs are typically post-hoc and global, offering limited insight
into individual node decisions or local reasoning. We introduce X-Node, a
self-explaining GNN framework in which each node generates its own explanation
as part of the prediction process. For every node, we construct a structured
context vector encoding interpretable cues such as degree, centrality,
clustering, feature saliency, and label agreement within its local topology. A
lightweight Reasoner module maps this context into a compact explanation
vector, which serves three purposes: (1) reconstructing the node's latent
embedding via a decoder to enforce faithfulness, (2) generating a natural
language explanation using a pre-trained LLM (e.g., Grok or Gemini), and (3)
guiding the GNN itself via a "text-injection" mechanism that feeds explanations
back into the message-passing pipeline. We evaluate X-Node on two graph
datasets derived from MedMNIST and MorphoMNIST, integrating it with GCN, GAT,
and GIN backbones. Our results show that X-Node maintains competitive
classification accuracy while producing faithful, per-node explanations.

*Xinrui Li,Qilin Fan,Tianfu Wang,Kaiwen Wei,Ke Yu,Xu Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GraphFedMIG是一个新颖的联邦图学习框架，通过生成对抗网络和互信息机制解决数据分布不均和类别不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦图学习中，非独立同分布数据和类别不平衡会导致模型偏向多数类，影响性能。GraphFedMIG旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用分层生成对抗网络，客户端训练本地生成器合成特征表示，并通过互信息机制优化生成器参数。

Result: 在四个真实数据集上的实验表明，GraphFedMIG优于其他基线方法。

Conclusion: GraphFedMIG有效解决了联邦图学习中的类别不平衡问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Federated graph learning (FGL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively
train powerful graph neural networks without sharing their private,
decentralized graph data. Inherited from generic federated learning, FGL is
critically challenged by statistical heterogeneity, where non-IID data
distributions across clients can severely impair model performance. A
particularly destructive form of this is class imbalance, which causes the
global model to become biased towards majority classes and fail at identifying
rare but critical events. This issue is exacerbated in FGL, as nodes from a
minority class are often surrounded by biased neighborhood information,
hindering the learning of expressive embeddings. To grapple with this
challenge, we propose GraphFedMIG, a novel FGL framework that reframes the
problem as a federated generative data augmentation task. GraphFedMIG employs a
hierarchical generative adversarial network where each client trains a local
generator to synthesize high-fidelity feature representations. To provide
tailored supervision, clients are grouped into clusters, each sharing a
dedicated discriminator. Crucially, the framework designs a mutual
information-guided mechanism to steer the evolution of these client generators.
By calculating each client's unique informational value, this mechanism
corrects the local generator parameters, ensuring that subsequent rounds of
mutual information-guided generation are focused on producing high-value,
minority-class features. We conduct extensive experiments on four real-world
datasets, and the results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
GraphFedMIG compared with other baselines.

TL;DR: EDAPT框架通过持续模型适应消除脑机接口（BCI）的校准需求，结合群体预训练和在线微调，显著提升准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决BCI因神经信号漂移和用户差异导致的准确性下降问题，减少频繁校准的需求。

Method: EDAPT先通过多用户数据训练基线解码器，再通过监督微调持续个性化模型。

Result: 在三个BCI任务的九个数据集中，EDAPT比传统静态方法更准确，且运行高效。

Conclusion: EDAPT为无校准BCI提供实用路径，减少部署障碍。

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) suffer from accuracy degradation as neural
signals drift over time and vary across users, requiring frequent recalibration
that limits practical deployment. We introduce EDAPT, a task- and
model-agnostic framework that eliminates calibration through continual model
adaptation. EDAPT first trains a baseline decoder using data from multiple
users, then continually personalizes this model via supervised finetuning as
the neural patterns evolve during use. We tested EDAPT across nine datasets
covering three BCI tasks, and found that it consistently improved accuracy over
conventional, static methods. These improvements primarily stem from combining
population-level pretraining and online continual finetuning, with unsupervised
domain adaptation providing further gains on some datasets. EDAPT runs
efficiently, updating models within 200 milliseconds on consumer-grade
hardware. Finally, decoding accuracy scales with total data budget rather than
its allocation between subjects and trials. EDAPT provides a practical pathway
toward calibration-free BCIs, reducing a major barrier to BCI deployment.

Result: 研究发现，特征工程、A/B测试和模块化等实践可能导致推荐系统性能下降。

Conclusion: 论文提供了减少或避免混杂因素影响的实用建议，以提升推荐系统性能。

Abstract: Unobserved confounding arises when an unmeasured feature influences both the
treatment and the outcome, leading to biased causal effect estimates. This
issue undermines observational studies in fields like economics, medicine,
ecology or epidemiology. Recommender systems leveraging fully observed data
seem not to be vulnerable to this problem. However many standard practices in
recommender systems result in observed features being ignored, resulting in
effectively the same problem. This paper will show that numerous common
practices such as feature engineering, A/B testing and modularization can in
fact introduce confounding into recommendation systems and hamper their
performance. Several illustrations of the phenomena are provided, supported by
simulation studies with practical suggestions about how practitioners may
reduce or avoid the affects of confounding in real systems.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We introduce an output layer for neural networks that ensures satisfaction of
convex constraints. Our approach, $\Pi$net, leverages operator splitting for
rapid and reliable projections in the forward pass, and the implicit function
theorem for backpropagation. We deploy $\Pi$net as a feasible-by-design
optimization proxy for parametric constrained optimization problems and obtain
modest-accuracy solutions faster than traditional solvers when solving a single
problem, and significantly faster for a batch of problems. We surpass
state-of-the-art learning approaches in terms of training time, solution
quality, and robustness to hyperparameter tuning, while maintaining similar
inference times. Finally, we tackle multi-vehicle motion planning with
non-convex trajectory preferences and provide $\Pi$net as a GPU-ready package
implemented in JAX with effective tuning heuristics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: JEPAs比基于重构的方法更强大，但现有方法在构建世界模型时仍有局限，因此需要一种更通用的技术。

Method: 整合序列嵌入与神经ODE，使用损失函数强制收缩嵌入和Lipschitz常数，以构建有序潜在状态空间。

Result: 在简单摆系统上仅使用图像数据成功生成了结构化潜在状态空间模型。

Conclusion: 该方法为机器人领域开发更通用的控制算法和估计技术提供了新途径。

Abstract: With the advent of Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs), which
appear to be more capable than reconstruction-based methods, this paper
introduces a novel technique for creating world models using continuous-time
dynamic systems from arbitrary observation data. The proposed method integrates
sequence embeddings with neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs).
It employs loss functions that enforce contractive embeddings and Lipschitz
constants in state transitions to construct a well-organized latent state
space. The approach's effectiveness is demonstrated through the generation of
structured latent state-space models for a simple pendulum system using only
image data. This opens up a new technique for developing more general control
algorithms and estimation techniques with broad applications in robotics.

Motivation: ReLU网络的解释常因依赖单个像素而显得嘈杂且难以理解，现有平滑方法（如GradCAM）牺牲了忠实性。

Method: 引入频谱框架，系统分析平滑性与忠实性的权衡，并量化ReLU网络对高频信息的贡献。

Result: 揭示了基于代理的平滑方法会导致解释失真，提出了“解释差距”的正式定义和测量方法。

Conclusion: 通过实验验证了理论发现，为解释方法的平滑性与忠实性权衡提供了原则性指导。

Abstract: ReLU networks, while prevalent for visual data, have sharp transitions,
sometimes relying on individual pixels for predictions, making vanilla
gradient-based explanations noisy and difficult to interpret. Existing methods,
such as GradCAM, smooth these explanations by producing surrogate models at the
cost of faithfulness. We introduce a unifying spectral framework to
systematically analyze and quantify smoothness, faithfulness, and their
trade-off in explanations. Using this framework, we quantify and regularize the
contribution of ReLU networks to high-frequency information, providing a
principled approach to identifying this trade-off. Our analysis characterizes
how surrogate-based smoothing distorts explanations, leading to an
``explanation gap'' that we formally define and measure for different post-hoc
methods. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings across different design
choices, datasets, and ablations.

Abstract: Although one-hot encoding is commonly used for multiclass classification, it

Codes (ECOC) address multiclass classification by mapping each class to a
unique codeword used as a label. Traditional ECOC methods rely on manually

Conclusion: 深度强化学习可有效优化NMC策略，显著提升组合优化问题的求解性能。

Abstract: Optimizing or sampling complex cost functions of combinatorial optimization
problems is a longstanding challenge across disciplines and applications. When
employing family of conventional algorithms based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) such as simulated annealing or parallel tempering, one assumes
homogeneous (equilibrium) temperature profiles across input. This instance
independent approach was shown to be ineffective for the hardest benchmarks
near a computational phase transition when the so-called overlap-gap-property
holds. In these regimes conventional MCMC struggles to unfreeze rigid
variables, escape suboptimal basins of attraction, and sample high-quality and
diverse solutions. In order to mitigate these challenges, Nonequilibrium
Nonlocal Monte Carlo (NMC) algorithms were proposed that leverage inhomogeneous
temperature profiles thereby accelerating exploration of the configuration
space without compromising its exploitation. Here, we employ deep reinforcement
learning (RL) to train the nonlocal transition policies of NMC which were
previously designed phenomenologically. We demonstrate that the resulting
solver can be trained solely by observing energy changes of the configuration
space exploration as RL rewards and the local minimum energy landscape geometry
as RL states. We further show that the trained policies improve upon the
standard MCMC-based and nonlocal simulated annealing on hard uniform random and
scale-free random 4-SAT benchmarks in terms of residual energy,
time-to-solution, and diversity of solutions metrics.

Motivation: 解决多预训练扩散模型生成联合样本时难以满足任务特定约束的问题。

Result: 在图像对生成、物体操纵和多机器人运动规划中表现出色，耦合效果提升且计算成本低。

Conclusion: PCD是一种高效且有效的框架，适用于需要联合生成和约束满足的任务。

Abstract: Modifications to test-time sampling have emerged as an important extension to
diffusion algorithms, with the goal of biasing the generative process to
achieve a given objective without having to retrain the entire diffusion model.
However, generating jointly correlated samples from multiple pre-trained
diffusion models while simultaneously enforcing task-specific constraints
without costly retraining has remained challenging. To this end, we propose
Projected Coupled Diffusion (PCD), a novel test-time framework for constrained
joint generation. PCD introduces a coupled guidance term into the generative
dynamics to encourage coordination between diffusion models and incorporates a
projection step at each diffusion step to enforce hard constraints.
Empirically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of PCD in application scenarios
of image-pair generation, object manipulation, and multi-robot motion planning.
Our results show improved coupling effects and guaranteed constraint
satisfaction without incurring excessive computational costs.

Abstract: Allergens, typically proteins capable of triggering adverse immune responses,
represent a significant public health challenge. To accurately identify
allergen proteins, we introduce Applm (Allergen Prediction with Protein
Language Models), a computational framework that leverages the 100-billion
parameter xTrimoPGLM protein language model. We show that Applm consistently
outperforms seven state-of-the-art methods in a diverse set of tasks that
closely resemble difficult real-world scenarios. These include identifying
novel allergens that lack similar examples in the training set, differentiating
between allergens and non-allergens among homologs with high sequence
similarity, and assessing functional consequences of mutations that create few
changes to the protein sequences. Our analysis confirms that xTrimoPGLM,
originally trained on one trillion tokens to capture general protein sequence
characteristics, is crucial for Applm's performance by detecting important
differences among protein sequences. In addition to providing Applm as
open-source software, we also provide our carefully curated benchmark datasets
to facilitate future research.

Motivation: 长时程强化学习任务中奖励稀疏和现有奖励塑造方法的局限性（如偏差或任务分解需求）是主要挑战。

Method: 提出了SWE-oriented RL Framework，支持多轮交互和自定义奖励函数，并设计了Gated Reward Accumulation（G-RA）方法，通过阈值控制奖励累积。

Result: 实验显示G-RA显著提高了任务完成率（47.6%→93.8%和22.0%→86.0%）和修改率（19.6%→23.8%和12.0%→42.0%），避免了奖励偏差导致的策略退化。

Conclusion: G-RA方法在长时程强化学习中实现了平衡的奖励累积，为软件工程任务提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Reward sparsity in long-horizon reinforcement learning (RL) tasks remains a
significant challenge, while existing outcome-based reward shaping struggles to
define meaningful immediate rewards without introducing bias or requiring
explicit task decomposition. Alternatively, verification-based reward shaping
uses stepwise critics, but misalignment between immediate rewards and long-term
objectives can lead to reward hacking and suboptimal policies. In this work, we
address this problem in the context of software engineering (SWE) tasks, where
multi-turn reasoning and rule-based verification are critical. We introduce the
SWE-oriented RL Framework, a unified system supporting multi-turn interaction,
docker-based execution, and customizable reward functions. Additionally, we
propose Gated Reward Accumulation (G-RA), a novel method that accumulates
immediate rewards only when high-level (long-term) rewards meet a predefined
threshold, ensuring stable RL optimization. Experiments on SWE-bench Verified
and kBench demonstrate that G-RA leads to an increase in completion rates
(47.6\% \rightarrow 93.8\% and 22.0\% \rightarrow 86.0\%) and modification
rates (19.6\% \rightarrow 23.8\% and 12.0\% \rightarrow 42.0\%), while avoiding
policy degradation caused by reward misalignment. Our findings highlight the
importance of balanced reward accumulation in long-horizon RL and provide a
practical solution.

Abstract: Estimating treatment effects (TE) from observational data is a critical yet
complex task in many fields, from healthcare and economics to public policy.
While recent advances in machine learning and causal inference have produced
powerful estimation techniques, their adoption remains limited due to the need
for deep expertise in causal assumptions, adjustment strategies, and model
selection. In this paper, we introduce CATE-B, an open-source co-pilot system
that uses large language models (LLMs) within an agentic framework to guide
users through the end-to-end process of treatment effect estimation. CATE-B
assists in (i) constructing a structural causal model via causal discovery and
LLM-based edge orientation, (ii) identifying robust adjustment sets through a
novel Minimal Uncertainty Adjustment Set criterion, and (iii) selecting
appropriate regression methods tailored to the causal structure and dataset
characteristics. To encourage reproducibility and evaluation, we release a
suite of benchmark tasks spanning diverse domains and causal complexities. By
combining causal inference with intelligent, interactive assistance, CATE-B
lowers the barrier to rigorous causal analysis and lays the foundation for a
new class of benchmarks in automated treatment effect estimation.

Conclusion: 统一学习通过图表示和uGNN优化，有效提升了异构模型在医学影像中的泛化能力，适用于分布差异大的场景。

Abstract: Deep learning models often struggle to maintain generalizability in medical
imaging, particularly under domain-fracture scenarios where distribution shifts
arise from varying imaging techniques, acquisition protocols, patient
populations, demographics, and equipment. In practice, each hospital may need
to train distinct models - differing in learning task, width, and depth - to
match local data. For example, one hospital may use Euclidean architectures
such as MLPs and CNNs for tabular or grid-like image data, while another may
require non-Euclidean architectures such as graph neural networks (GNNs) for
irregular data like brain connectomes. How to train such heterogeneous models
coherently across datasets, while enhancing each model's generalizability,
remains an open problem. We propose unified learning, a new paradigm that
encodes each model into a graph representation, enabling unification in a
shared graph learning space. A GNN then guides optimization of these unified
models. By decoupling parameters of individual models and controlling them
through a unified GNN (uGNN), our method supports parameter sharing and
knowledge transfer across varying architectures (MLPs, CNNs, GNNs) and
distributions, improving generalizability. Evaluations on MorphoMNIST and two
MedMNIST benchmarks - PneumoniaMNIST and BreastMNIST - show that unified
learning boosts performance when models are trained on unique distributions and
tested on mixed ones, demonstrating strong robustness to unseen data with large
distribution shifts. Code and benchmarks: https://github.com/basiralab/uGNN

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于生成对抗变换器（GATs）的新方法，用于解决能源系统模型中时间序列上采样的信息丢失和噪声问题，无需依赖高分辨率数据训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统上采样方法存在信息丢失或噪声增加的问题，而现有高级模型（如生成模型、超分辨率模型和插补模型）因依赖高分辨率数据训练而难以应用。

Method: 采用生成对抗变换器（GATs），无需高分辨率数据训练，通过学习原始数据分布生成高分辨率时间序列。

Conclusion: GATs方法有效解决了上采样问题，无需高分辨率数据训练，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: To bridge the temporal granularity gap in energy network design and operation
based on Energy System Models, resampling of time series is required. While
conventional upsampling methods are computationally efficient, they often
result in significant information loss or increased noise. Advanced models such
as time series generation models, Super-Resolution models and imputation models
show potential, but also face fundamental challenges. The goal of time series
generative models is to learn the distribution of the original data to generate
high-resolution series with similar statistical characteristics. This is not
entirely consistent with the definition of upsampling. Time series
Super-Resolution models or imputation models can degrade the accuracy of
upsampling because the input low-resolution time series are sparse and may have
insufficient context. Moreover, such models usually rely on supervised learning
paradigms. This presents a fundamental application paradox: their training
requires the high-resolution time series that is intrinsically absent in
upsampling application scenarios. To address the mentioned upsampling issue,
this paper introduces a new method utilizing Generative Adversarial
Transformers (GATs), which can be trained without access to any ground-truth
high-resolution data. Compared with conventional interpolation methods, the
introduced method can reduce the root mean square error (RMSE) of upsampling
tasks by 9%, and the accuracy of a model predictive control (MPC) application
scenario is improved by 13%.

Result: 在多个基准数据集上表现出优异的检测性能、效率和扩展性，无需训练或迭代优化。

Conclusion: FreeGAD为图异常检测提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案，挑战了传统训练的重要性。

Abstract: Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD) aims to identify nodes that deviate from the
majority within a graph, playing a crucial role in applications such as social
networks and e-commerce. Despite the current advancements in deep
learning-based GAD, existing approaches often suffer from high deployment costs
and poor scalability due to their complex and resource-intensive training
processes. Surprisingly, our empirical findings suggest that the training phase
of deep GAD methods, commonly perceived as crucial, may actually contribute
less to anomaly detection performance than expected. Inspired by this, we
propose FreeGAD, a novel training-free yet effective GAD method. Specifically,
it leverages an affinity-gated residual encoder to generate anomaly-aware
representations. Meanwhile, FreeGAD identifies anchor nodes as pseudo-normal
and anomalous guides, followed by calculating anomaly scores through
anchor-guided statistical deviations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FreeGAD achieves superior anomaly detection performance, efficiency, and
scalability on multiple benchmark datasets from diverse domains, without any
training or iterative optimization.

Abstract: Understanding the behavior of deep networks is crucial to increase our
confidence in their results. Despite an extensive body of work for explaining
their predictions, researchers have faced reliability issues, which can be
attributed to insufficient formalism. In our research, we adopt novel
probabilistic and spectral perspectives to formally analyze explanation
methods. Our study reveals a pervasive spectral bias stemming from the use of
gradient, and sheds light on some common design choices that have been
discovered experimentally, in particular, the use of squared gradient and input
perturbation. We further characterize how the choice of perturbation
hyperparameters in explanation methods, such as SmoothGrad, can lead to
inconsistent explanations and introduce two remedies based on our proposed
formalism: (i) a mechanism to determine a standard perturbation scale, and (ii)
an aggregation method which we call SpectralLens. Finally, we substantiate our
theoretical results through quantitative evaluations.

Result: 提出的方法显著提高了样本效率，同时保留了PGMs在大规模状态-动作空间中的可扩展性优势。

Conclusion: 方差缩减技术是解决MORL中样本效率问题的有效方法，为复杂决策场景提供了更实用的工具。

Abstract: Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) is a generalization of
traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) that aims to optimize multiple, often
conflicting objectives simultaneously rather than focusing on a single reward.
This approach is crucial in complex decision-making scenarios where agents must
balance trade-offs between various goals, such as maximizing performance while
minimizing costs. We consider the problem of MORL where the objectives are
combined using a non-linear scalarization function. Just like in standard RL,
policy gradient methods (PGMs) are amongst the most effective for handling
large and continuous state-action spaces in MORL. However, existing PGMs for
MORL suffer from high sample inefficiency, requiring large amounts of data to
be effective. Previous attempts to solve this problem rely on overly strict
assumptions, losing PGMs' benefits in scalability to large state-action spaces.
In this work, we address the issue of sample efficiency by implementing
variance-reduction techniques to reduce the sample complexity of policy
gradients while maintaining general assumptions.

Method: 利用IRT参数对数据集进行划分，并在四个表格数据集上评估其对多种ML模型性能的影响。

Result: IRT揭示了数据实例的异质性，并创建了平衡分区，显著提升了模型性能。高猜测参数的实例会显著降低模型表现。

Conclusion: IRT指导的数据划分能更有效地验证ML模型，并揭示数据中的关键子群。

Abstract: Robust validation of Machine Learning (ML) models is essential, but
traditional data partitioning approaches often ignore the intrinsic quality of
each instance. This study proposes the use of Item Response Theory (IRT)
parameters to characterize and guide the partitioning of datasets in the model
validation stage. The impact of IRT-informed partitioning strategies on the
performance of several ML models in four tabular datasets was evaluated. The
results obtained demonstrate that IRT reveals an inherent heterogeneity of the
instances and highlights the existence of informative subgroups of instances
within the same dataset. Based on IRT, balanced partitions were created that
consistently help to better understand the tradeoff between bias and variance
of the models. In addition, the guessing parameter proved to be a determining
factor: training with high-guessing instances can significantly impair model
performance and resulted in cases with accuracy below 50%, while other
partitions reached more than 70% in the same dataset.

Abstract: Predicting changes in binding free energy ($\Delta\Delta G$) is a vital task
in protein engineering and protein-protein interaction (PPI) engineering for
drug discovery. Previous works have observed a high correlation between
$\Delta\Delta G$ and entropy, using probabilities of biologically important
objects such as side chain angles and residue identities to estimate
$\Delta\Delta G$. However, estimating the full conformational distribution of a
protein complex is generally considered intractable. In this work, we propose a
new approach to $\Delta\Delta G$ prediction that avoids this issue by instead
leveraging energy-based models for estimating the probability of a complex's
conformation. Specifically, we novelly decompose $\Delta\Delta G$ into a
sequence-based component estimated by an inverse folding model and a
structure-based component estimated by an energy model. This decomposition is
made tractable by assuming equilibrium between the bound and unbound states,
allowing us to simplify the estimation of degeneracies associated with each
state. Unlike previous deep learning-based methods, our method incorporates an
energy-based physical inductive bias by connecting the often-used sequence
log-odds ratio-based approach to $\Delta\Delta G$ prediction with a new
$\Delta\Delta E$ term grounded in statistical mechanics. We demonstrate
superiority over existing state-of-the-art structure and sequence-based deep
learning methods in $\Delta\Delta G$ prediction and antibody optimization
against SARS-CoV-2.

Result: MCIB在不依赖捷径学习的情况下取得了最佳性能。

Conclusion: MCIB通过改进模态融合策略和消除捷径信号，有效提升了多模态讽刺检测的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal sarcasm detection is a complex task that requires distinguishing
subtle complementary signals across modalities while filtering out irrelevant
information. Many advanced methods rely on learning shortcuts from datasets
rather than extracting intended sarcasm-related features. However, our
experiments show that shortcut learning impairs the model's generalization in
real-world scenarios. Furthermore, we reveal the weaknesses of current modality
fusion strategies for multimodal sarcasm detection through systematic
experiments, highlighting the necessity of focusing on effective modality
fusion for complex emotion recognition. To address these challenges, we
construct MUStARD++$^{R}$ by removing shortcut signals from MUStARD++. Then, a
Multimodal Conditional Information Bottleneck (MCIB) model is introduced to
enable efficient multimodal fusion for sarcasm detection. Experimental results
show that the MCIB achieves the best performance without relying on shortcut
learning.

Result: 在14个基准数据集上，SPHENIC比现有最优方法性能提升了3.31%-6.54%。

Conclusion: SPHENIC通过结合拓扑和空间信息，显著提升了空间转录组聚类的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: By incorporating spatial location information, spatial-transcriptomics
clustering yields more comprehensive insights into cell subpopulation
identification. Despite recent progress, existing methods have at least two
limitations: (i) topological learning typically considers only representations
of individual cells or their interaction graphs; however, spatial
transcriptomic profiles are often noisy, making these approaches vulnerable to
low-quality topological signals, and (ii) insufficient modeling of spatial
neighborhood information leads to low-quality spatial embeddings. To address
these limitations, we propose SPHENIC, a novel Spatial Persistent Homology
Enhanced Neighborhood Integrative Clustering method. Specifically, SPHENIC
incorporates invariant topological features into the clustering network to
achieve stable representation learning. Additionally, to construct high-quality
spatial embeddings that reflect the true cellular distribution, we design the
Spatial Constraint and Distribution Optimization Module (SCDOM). This module
increases the similarity between a cell's embedding and those of its spatial
neighbors, decreases similarity with non-neighboring cells, and thereby
produces clustering-friendly spatial embeddings. Extensive experiments on 14
benchmark spatial transcriptomic slices demonstrate that SPHENIC achieves
superior performance on the spatial clustering task, outperforming existing
state-of-the-art methods by 3.31%-6.54% over the best alternative.

Result: 在12个大都市区的实验中，模型在分辨率≥0.7×0.7km²时，MAE低于基线模型。

Conclusion: 生成式模型能有效捕捉时空模式，未来研究将整合更多地球物理属性和驱动变量。

Abstract: Land cover, both present and future, has a significant effect on several
important Earth system processes. For example, impervious surfaces heat up and
speed up surface water runoff and reduce groundwater infiltration, with
concomitant effects on regional hydrology and flood risk. While regional Earth
System models have increasing skill at forecasting hydrologic and atmospheric
processes at high resolution in future climate scenarios, our ability to
forecast land-use and land-cover change (LULC), a critical input to risk and
consequences assessment for these scenarios, has lagged behind. In this paper,
we propose a new paradigm exploiting Generative AI (GenAI) for land cover
change forecasting by framing LULC forecasting as a data synthesis problem
conditioned on historical and auxiliary data-sources. We discuss desirable
properties of generative models that fundament our research premise, and
demonstrate the feasibility of our methodology through experiments on
imperviousness forecasting using historical data covering the entire
conterminous United States. Specifically, we train a diffusion model for
decadal forecasting of imperviousness and compare its performance to a baseline
that assumes no change at all. Evaluation across 12 metropolitan areas for a
year held-out during training indicate that for average resolutions $\geq
0.7\times0.7km^2$ our model yields MAE lower than such a baseline. This finding
corroborates that such a generative model can capture spatiotemporal patterns
from historical data that are significant for projecting future change.
Finally, we discuss future research to incorporate auxiliary information on
physical properties about the Earth, as well as supporting simulation of
different scenarios by means of driver variables.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning a neural sampler to generate samples from
discrete state spaces where the target probability mass function
$\pi\propto\mathrm{e}^{-U}$ is known up to a normalizing constant, which is an
important task in fields such as statistical physics, machine learning,
combinatorial optimization, etc. To better address this challenging task when
the state space has a large cardinality and the distribution is multi-modal, we

$\textbf{S}$ampler ($\textbf{MDNS}$), a novel framework for training discrete
neural samplers by aligning two path measures through a family of learning
objectives, theoretically grounded in the stochastic optimal control of the
continuous-time Markov chains. We validate the efficiency and scalability of
MDNS through extensive experiments on various distributions with distinct
statistical properties, where MDNS learns to accurately sample from the target
distributions despite the extremely high problem dimensions and outperforms
other learning-based baselines by a large margin. A comprehensive study of
ablations and extensions is also provided to demonstrate the efficacy and
potential of the proposed framework.

TL;DR: REFN利用强化学习训练大型语言模型，自动生成网络过滤器以防御1天或N天漏洞攻击，解决了现有防御方法的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法（如主机补丁和网络过滤）在可扩展性、兼容性和部署过程中存在问题，无法有效应对大规模漏洞威胁。

Method: REFN通过强化学习驱动在线网络奖励训练LLM，结合Agentic RAG知识蒸馏和在线验证，生成兼容且稳健的网络过滤器。

Result: 在22类漏洞测试中，REFN表现出高效（平均修复时间3.65小时）、高准确率（比替代方法高21.1%）和强扩展性（支持10K设备）。

Conclusion: REFN为利用LLM快速防御大规模漏洞攻击提供了初步解决方案。

Abstract: The exploitation of 1 day or n day vulnerabilities poses severe threats to
networked devices due to massive deployment scales and delayed patching
(average Mean Time To Patch exceeds 60 days). Existing defenses, including host
based patching and network based filtering, are inadequate due to limited
scalability across diverse devices, compatibility issues especially with
embedded or legacy systems, and error prone deployment process (manual patch
validation). To address these issues, we introduce REFN (Reinforcement Learning
From Network), a novel framework that trains Large Language Models (LLMs) to
autonomously generate network filters to prevent 1 day or n day exploitations.
REFN ensures scalability by uniquely employs Reinforcement Learning (RL) driven
by online network rewards instead of traditional Human Feedback (RLHF). REFN
guarantees compatibility via unified deployment on edge security gateways
(Amazon Eero). REFN provides robustness via online validation using real
network traffic. Crucially, REFN addresses three core challenges in training
LLMs for exploit prevention: 1) expanding current LLMs limited vulnerability
fixing expertise via Agentic RAG based Knowledge Distillation, 2) bridging
current LLMs language to network gaps through an RL From VNF Pipeline that
translates language context (vulnerability description) into network
enforcement, 3) addressing the LLM hallucination and non determinism via the
Online Agentic Validation that penalizes erroneous outputs. Evaluated across 22
families of 1 day or n day exploits, REFN demonstrates effectiveness (21.1
percent higher accuracy than alternatives), efficiency (Mean Time To Patch of
3.65 hours) and scalability (easily scale to 10K devices). REFN serves as an
initial step toward training LLMs to rapidly prevent massive scale 1 day or n
day exploitations.

processing units (GPUs) based on an open-source electromagnetic (EM) simulation
software (gprMax) for machine learning applications of antenna design and
optimization. Furthermore, it compares the simulation results with those
obtained through commercial EM software. The proposed software framework for
machine learning and surrogate model applications will produce antenna data
sets consisting of a large number of antenna simulation results using GPUs.
Although machine learning methods can attain the optimum solutions for many
problems, they are known to be data-hungry and require a great deal of samples
for the training stage of the algorithms. However, producing a sufficient
number of training samples in EM applications within a limited time is
challenging due to the high computational complexity of EM simulations.
Therefore, GPUs are utilized in this study to simulate a large number of
antennas with predefined or random antenna shape parameters to produce data
sets. Moreover, this study also compares various machine learning and deep
learning models in terms of antenna parameter estimation performance. This
study demonstrates that an entry-level GPU substantially outperforms a high-end
CPU in terms of computational performance, while a high-end gaming GPU can
achieve around 18 times more computational performance compared to a high-end
CPU. Moreover, it is shown that the open-source EM simulation software can
deliver similar results to those obtained via commercial software in the
simulation of microstrip antennas when the spatial resolution of the
simulations is sufficiently fine.

Abstract: Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) has presented a significant challenge
to deliver personalized models to individual clients through collaborative
training. Existing PFL methods are often vulnerable to non-IID data, which
severely hinders collective generalization and then compromises the subsequent
personalization efforts. In this paper, to address this non-IID issue in PFL,
we propose an Analytic Personalized Federated Learning (APFL) approach via
dual-stream least squares. In our APFL, we use a foundation model as a frozen
backbone for feature extraction. Subsequent to the feature extractor, we
develop dual-stream analytic models to achieve both collective generalization
and individual personalization. Specifically, our APFL incorporates a shared
primary stream for global generalization across all clients, and a dedicated
refinement stream for local personalization of each individual client. The
analytical solutions of our APFL enable its ideal property of heterogeneity
invariance, theoretically meaning that each personalized model remains
identical regardless of how heterogeneous the data are distributed across all
other clients. Empirical results across various datasets also validate the
superiority of our APFL over state-of-the-art baselines, with advantages of at
least 1.10%-15.45% in accuracy.

TL;DR: 本文提出使用Pass@k作为奖励来提升强化学习中的探索能力，并通过理论分析证明其优势，同时指出探索与利用可以相互促进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习使用Pass@1作为奖励时，容易陷入局部最优，探索能力不足。Pass@k作为奖励的潜力尚未被充分研究。

Method: 采用Pass@k作为奖励训练策略模型（Pass@k Training），并通过理论分析推导其优势。

Result: 实验表明Pass@k Training能提升探索能力，且探索与利用可以相互促进。

Conclusion: Pass@k Training为强化学习提供了一种高效方法，并启发了优势函数设计的新方向。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), which typically adopts
Pass@1 as the reward, has faced the issues in balancing exploration and
exploitation, causing policies to prefer conservative actions, converging to a
local optimum. Identifying an appropriate reward metric is therefore crucial.
Regarding the prior work, although Pass@k has been used in evaluation, its
connection to LLM exploration ability in RLVR remains largely overlooked. To
investigate this, we first use Pass@k as the reward to train the policy model
(i.e., $\textbf{Pass@k Training}$), and observe the improvement on its
exploration ability. Next, we derive an analytical solution for the advantage
of Pass@k Training, leading to an efficient and effective process. Building on
this, our analysis reveals that exploration and exploitation are not inherently
conflicting objectives, while they can mutually enhance each other. Moreover,
Pass@k Training with analytical derivation essentially involves directly
designing the advantage function. Inspired by this, we preliminarily explore
the advantage design for RLVR, showing promising results and highlighting a
potential future direction.

Abstract: Unlocking the potential of transformers on datasets of large physical systems
depends on overcoming the quadratic scaling of the attention mechanism. This
work explores combining the Erwin architecture with the Native Sparse Attention
(NSA) mechanism to improve the efficiency and receptive field of transformer
models for large-scale physical systems, addressing the challenge of quadratic
attention complexity. We adapt the NSA mechanism for non-sequential data,
implement the Erwin NSA model, and evaluate it on three datasets from the
physical sciences -- cosmology simulations, molecular dynamics, and air
pressure modeling -- achieving performance that matches or exceeds that of the
original Erwin model. Additionally, we reproduce the experimental results from
the Erwin paper to validate their implementation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于公开的蛋白质-配体复合物数据稀缺，现有模型容易过拟合训练集偏差，因此需要一种新方法来学习可迁移的几何先验。

Method: IBEX使用PAC-Bayesian信息瓶颈理论量化样本信息密度，结合Scaffold Hopping任务提升模型能力，并采用L-BFGS优化步骤精细调整分子构象。

Result: IBEX将零样本对接成功率从53%提升至64%，Vina评分从-7.41 kcal mol^{-1}提升至-8.07 kcal mol^{-1}，并在57/100口袋中取得最佳中位Vina能量。

Conclusion: IBEX显著提升了药物设计的性能，包括对接成功率、评分和多样性，同时减少了外推误差。

Abstract: Three-dimensional generative models increasingly drive structure-based drug
discovery, yet it remains constrained by the scarce publicly available
protein-ligand complexes. Under such data scarcity, almost all existing
pipelines struggle to learn transferable geometric priors and consequently
overfit to training-set biases. As such, we present IBEX, an
Information-Bottleneck-EXplored coarse-to-fine pipeline to tackle the chronic
shortage of protein-ligand complex data in structure-based drug design.
Specifically, we use PAC-Bayesian information-bottleneck theory to quantify the
information density of each sample. This analysis reveals how different masking
strategies affect generalization and indicates that, compared with conventional
de novo generation, the constrained Scaffold Hopping task endows the model with
greater effective capacity and improved transfer performance. IBEX retains the
original TargetDiff architecture and hyperparameters for training to generate
molecules compatible with the binding pocket; it then applies an L-BFGS
optimization step to finely refine each conformation by optimizing five
physics-based terms and adjusting six translational and rotational degrees of
freedom in under one second. With only these modifications, IBEX raises the
zero-shot docking success rate on CBGBench CrossDocked2020-based from 53% to
64%, improves the mean Vina score from $-7.41 kcal mol^{-1}$ to $-8.07 kcal
mol^{-1}$, and achieves the best median Vina energy in 57 of 100 pockets versus
3 for the original TargetDiff. IBEX also increases the QED by 25%, achieves
state-of-the-art validity and diversity, and markedly reduces extrapolation
error.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GNN-based GAD模型可能放大训练数据中的偏见，导致不公平结果，而现有公平性方法多针对节点分类任务，缺乏对基于自动编码器的GAD模型的关注。

Method: 提出DECAF-GAD框架，使用结构因果模型（SCM）解耦敏感属性，设计专用自动编码器架构和公平性损失函数。

Result: 实验表明，DECAF-GAD在异常检测性能和公平性指标上均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: DECAF-GAD成功解决了GAD中的公平性问题，同时保持了高性能。

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection (GAD) has become an increasingly important task
across various domains. With the rapid development of graph neural networks
(GNNs), GAD methods have achieved significant performance improvements.
However, fairness considerations in GAD remain largely underexplored. Indeed,
GNN-based GAD models can inherit and amplify biases present in training data,
potentially leading to unfair outcomes. While existing efforts have focused on
developing fair GNNs, most approaches target node classification tasks, where
models often rely on simple layer architectures rather than autoencoder-based
structures, which are the most widely used architecturs for anomaly detection.
To address fairness in autoencoder-based GAD models, we propose
\textbf{D}is\textbf{E}ntangled \textbf{C}ounterfactual \textbf{A}dversarial
\textbf{F}air (DECAF)-GAD, a framework that alleviates bias while preserving
GAD performance. Specifically, we introduce a structural causal model (SCM) to
disentangle sensitive attributes from learned representations. Based on this
causal framework, we formulate a specialized autoencoder architecture along
with a fairness-guided loss function. Through extensive experiments on both
synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that DECAF-GAD not only
achieves competitive anomaly detection performance but also significantly
enhances fairness metrics compared to baseline GAD methods. Our code is

Motivation: 现实应用中（如医疗和推荐系统），传统RMAB算法假设的平稳性常被打破，需要解决非平稳动态带来的挑战。

Method: 提出RMAB算法，结合滑动窗口强化学习和UCB机制，学习动态变化的状态转移。

Result: 算法实现了O~(N²B^(1/4)T^(3/4))的遗憾界，为非平稳RMAB问题提供了理论框架。

Conclusion: RMAB算法首次为非平稳RMAB问题提供了有效的解决方案和理论基础。

Abstract: Online restless multi-armed bandits (RMABs) typically assume that each arm
follows a stationary Markov Decision Process (MDP) with fixed state transitions
and rewards. However, in real-world applications like healthcare and
recommendation systems, these assumptions often break due to non-stationary
dynamics, posing significant challenges for traditional RMAB algorithms. In
this work, we specifically consider $N$-armd RMAB with non-stationary
transition constrained by bounded variation budgets $B$. Our proposed \rmab\;
algorithm integrates sliding window reinforcement learning (RL) with an upper
confidence bound (UCB) mechanism to simultaneously learn transition dynamics
and their variations. We further establish that \rmab\; achieves
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(N^2 B^{\frac{1}{4}} T^{\frac{3}{4}})$ regret bound by
leveraging a relaxed definition of regret, providing a foundational theoretical
framework for non-stationary RMAB problems for the first time.

Conclusion: 本文通过统一比较和评估，为在线高斯过程算法的实际应用提供了指导。

Abstract: Gaussian Processes (GPs) are widely used for regression and system
identification due to their flexibility and ability to quantify uncertainty.
However, their computational complexity limits their applicability to small
datasets. Moreover in a streaming scenario, more and more datapoints accumulate
which is intractable even for Sparse GPs. Online GPs aim to alleviate this
problem by e.g. defining a maximum budget of datapoints and removing redundant
datapoints. This work provides a unified comparison of several reduction
criteria, analyzing both their computational complexity and reduction behavior.
The criteria are evaluated on benchmark functions and real-world datasets,
including dynamic system identification tasks. Additionally, acceptance
criteria are proposed to further filter out redundant datapoints. This work
yields practical guidelines for choosing a suitable criterion for an online GP
algorithm.

Abstract: Memory is fundamental to intelligence, enabling learning, reasoning, and
adaptability across biological and artificial systems. While Transformer
architectures excel at sequence modeling, they face critical limitations in
long-range context retention, continual learning, and knowledge integration.
This review presents a unified framework bridging neuroscience principles,
including dynamic multi-timescale memory, selective attention, and
consolidation, with engineering advances in Memory-Augmented Transformers. We
organize recent progress through three taxonomic dimensions: functional
objectives (context extension, reasoning, knowledge integration, adaptation),
memory representations (parameter-encoded, state-based, explicit, hybrid), and
integration mechanisms (attention fusion, gated control, associative
retrieval). Our analysis of core memory operations (reading, writing,
forgetting, and capacity management) reveals a shift from static caches toward
adaptive, test-time learning systems. We identify persistent challenges in
scalability and interference, alongside emerging solutions including
hierarchical buffering and surprise-gated updates. This synthesis provides a
roadmap toward cognitively-inspired, lifelong-learning Transformer
architectures.

Result: 提出了首个结构化概述，帮助实践者和研究者有效应用数据最小化原则，并促进AI/ML中数据最小化策略的统一理解和广泛采用。

Conclusion: 本文为DMML领域提供了一个系统性框架，有助于解决实践中的混淆问题，并推动数据最小化在AI/ML中的进一步应用。

Abstract: Data minimization (DM) describes the principle of collecting only the data
strictly necessary for a given task. It is a foundational principle across
major data protection regulations like GDPR and CPRA. Violations of this
principle have substantial real-world consequences, with regulatory actions
resulting in fines reaching hundreds of millions of dollars. Notably, the
relevance of data minimization is particularly pronounced in machine learning
(ML) applications, which typically rely on large datasets, resulting in an
emerging research area known as Data Minimization in Machine Learning (DMML).
At the same time, existing work on other ML privacy and security topics often
addresses concerns relevant to DMML without explicitly acknowledging the
connection. This disconnect leads to confusion among practitioners,
complicating their efforts to implement DM principles and interpret the
terminology, metrics, and evaluation criteria used across different research
communities. To address this gap, our work introduces a comprehensive framework
for DMML, including a unified data pipeline, adversaries, and points of
minimization. This framework allows us to systematically review the literature
on data minimization and \emph{DM-adjacent} methodologies, for the first time
presenting a structured overview designed to help practitioners and researchers
effectively apply DM principles. Our work facilitates a unified DM-centric
understanding and broader adoption of data minimization strategies in AI/ML.

Abstract: Data attribution methods aim to answer useful counterfactual questions like
"what would a ML model's prediction be if it were trained on a different
dataset?" However, estimation of data attribution models through techniques
like empirical influence or "datamodeling" remains very computationally
expensive. This causes a critical trust issue: if only a few computationally
rich parties can obtain data attributions, how can resource-constrained parties
trust that the provided attributions are indeed "good," especially when they
are used for important downstream applications (e.g., data pricing)? In this
paper, we address this trust issue by proposing an interactive verification
paradigm for data attribution. An untrusted and computationally powerful Prover
learns data attributions, and then engages in an interactive proof with a
resource-constrained Verifier. Our main result is a protocol that provides
formal completeness, soundness, and efficiency guarantees in the sense of
Probably-Approximately-Correct (PAC) verification. Specifically, if both Prover
and Verifier follow the protocol, the Verifier accepts data attributions that
are {\epsilon}-close to the optimal data attributions (in terms of the Mean
Squared Error) with probability 1-{\delta}. Conversely, if the Prover
arbitrarily deviates from the protocol, even with infinite compute, then this
is detected (or it still yields data attributions to the Verifier) except with
probability {\delta}. Importantly, our protocol ensures the Verifier's
workload, measured by the number of independent model retrainings it must
perform, scales only as O(1/{\epsilon}); i.e., independently of the dataset
size. At a technical level, our results apply to efficiently verifying any
linear function over the boolean hypercube computed by the Prover, making them
broadly applicable to various attribution tasks.

Motivation: AI驱动的药物设计虽然能提高效率，但缺乏实验先验知识可能导致设计结果违反隐含约束（如突变性）。本文旨在通过构建一个包含实验先验知识的数据集来解决这一问题。

Method: 使用LLM管道从文献中提取化合物信息，构建包含3200万对自然语言事实和实体表示的数据集\ourdataset，并训练LLM、CLIP和LLava模型联合推理文本与设计目标。

Conclusion: \ourdataset能有效提升AI驱动药物设计的先验知识，生成更安全且有效的分子，数据集已公开并计划扩展。

Abstract: AI-driven discovery can greatly reduce design time and enhance new
therapeutics' effectiveness. Models using simulators explore broad design
spaces but risk violating implicit constraints due to a lack of experimental
priors. For example, in a new analysis we performed on a diverse set of models
on the GuacaMol benchmark using supervised classifiers, over 60\% of molecules
proposed had high probability of being mutagenic. In this work, we introduce
\ourdataset, a dataset of priors for design problems extracted from literature
describing compounds used in lab settings. It is constructed with LLM pipelines
for discovering therapeutic entities in relevant paragraphs and summarizing
information in concise fair-use facts. \ourdataset~ consists of 32.3 million
pairs of natural language facts, and appropriate entity representations (i.e.
SMILES or refseq IDs). To demonstrate the potential of the data, we train LLM,
CLIP, and LLava architectures to reason jointly about text and design targets
and evaluate on tasks from the Therapeutic Data Commons (TDC). \ourdataset~is
highly effective for creating models with strong priors: in supervised
prediction problems that use our data as pretraining, our best models with 15M
learnable parameters outperform larger 2B TxGemma on both regression and
classification TDC tasks, and perform comparably to 9B models on average.
Models built with \ourdataset~can be used as constraints while optimizing for
novel molecules in GuacaMol, resulting in proposals that are safer and nearly
as effective. We release our dataset at
\href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/medexanon/Medex}{huggingface.co/datasets/medexanon/Medex},
and will provide expanded versions as available literature grows.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 共享微出行（如共享单车和电动滑板车）的普及带来了道路拥堵和车辆部署不公等问题，现有监管框架假设对运营商进行侵入式控制，不切实际。

Method: 设计了REALISM框架，通过Shapley值评估运营商对城市目标的贡献，并优化评分模型以实现公平。采用交替优化方法使运营商与城市监管机构互动直至收敛。

Result: 基于芝加哥电动滑板车数据的实验显示，该方法在车辆使用公平性上提升了至少39.93%，城市平均需求满足率提升了1.82%。

Conclusion: REALISM框架有效解决了多运营商共享微出行服务的协调问题，提升了公平性和需求满足率。

Abstract: Shared micromobility (e.g., shared bikes and electric scooters), as a kind of
emerging urban transportation, has become more and more popular in the world.
However, the blooming of shared micromobility vehicles brings some social
problems to the city (e.g., overloaded vehicles on roads, and the inequity of
vehicle deployment), which deviate from the city regulator's expectation of the
service of the shared micromobility system. In addition, the multi-operator
shared micromobility system in a city complicates the problem because of their
non-cooperative self-interested pursuits. Existing regulatory frameworks of
multi-operator vehicle rebalancing generally assume the intrusive control of
vehicle rebalancing of all the operators, which is not practical in the real
world. To address this limitation, we design REALISM, a regulatory framework
for coordinated scheduling in multi-operator shared micromobility services that
incorporates the city regulator's regulations in the form of assigning a score
to each operator according to the city goal achievements and operators'
individual contributions to achieving the city goal, measured by Shapley value.
To realize the fairness-aware score assignment, we measure the fairness of
assigned scores and use them as one of the components to optimize the score
assignment model. To optimize the whole framework, we develop an alternating
procedure to make operators and the city regulator interact with each other
until convergence. We evaluate our framework based on real-world e-scooter
usage data in Chicago. Our experiment results show that our method achieves a
performance gain of at least 39.93% in the equity of vehicle usage and 1.82% in
the average demand satisfaction of the whole city.

Result: 在Ego4D-AVD验证集上，TalkNet和Light-ASD骨干网络分别达到70.2%和66.7%的mAP。

Conclusion: 集成方法有效利用了两种模型的互补优势，提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Audiovisual active speaker detection (ASD) in egocentric recordings is
challenged by frequent occlusions, motion blur, and audio interference, which
undermine the discernability of temporal synchrony between lip movement and
speech. Traditional synchronisation-based systems perform well under clean
conditions but degrade sharply in first-person recordings. Conversely,
face-voice association (FVA)-based methods forgo synchronisation modelling in
favour of cross-modal biometric matching, exhibiting robustness to transient
visual corruption but suffering when overlapping speech or front-end
segmentation errors occur. In this paper, a simple yet effective ensemble
approach is proposed to fuse synchronisation-dependent and
synchronisation-agnostic model outputs via weighted averaging, thereby
harnessing complementary cues without introducing complex fusion architectures.
A refined preprocessing pipeline for the FVA-based component is also introduced
to optimise ensemble integration. Experiments on the Ego4D-AVD validation set
demonstrate that the ensemble attains 70.2% and 66.7% mean Average Precision
(mAP) with TalkNet and Light-ASD backbones, respectively. A qualitative
analysis stratified by face image quality and utterance masking prevalence
further substantiates the complementary strengths of each component.

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一种可扩展、经济高效的室内机器人定位解决方案，解决了机器人绑架问题。

Abstract: Global localization is essential for autonomous robotics, especially in
indoor environments where the GPS signal is denied. We propose a novel
WiFi-based localization framework that leverages ubiquitous wireless
infrastructure and the OpenStreetMap Area Graph (osmAG) for large-scale indoor
environments. Our approach integrates signal propagation modeling with osmAG's
geometric and topological priors. In the offline phase, an iterative
optimization algorithm localizes WiFi Access Points (APs) by modeling wall
attenuation, achieving a mean localization error of 3.79 m (35.3\% improvement
over trilateration). In the online phase, real-time robot localization uses the
augmented osmAG map, yielding a mean error of 3.12 m in fingerprinted areas
(8.77\% improvement over KNN fingerprinting) and 3.83 m in non-fingerprinted
areas (81.05\% improvement). Comparison with a fingerprint-based method shows
that our approach is much more space efficient and achieves superior
localization accuracy, especially for positions where no fingerprint data are
available. Validated across a complex 11,025 &m^2& multi-floor environment,
this framework offers a scalable, cost-effective solution for indoor robotic
localization, solving the kidnapped robot problem. The code and dataset are
available at https://github.com/XuMa369/osmag-wifi-localization.

Motivation: 在动态环境中，由于空间和时间约束复杂，传统方法难以找到数值求解器的初始猜测。

Method: 利用空间-时间凸集图（ST-GCS）生成无碰撞的最优轨迹，无需初始猜测，并探索了通用约束的适配策略。

Result: ST-GCS在静态环境中与传统GCS等效，在动态环境中能生成最小距离的无碰撞轨迹。

Conclusion: ST-GCS是一种高效的方法，适用于动态环境中的轨迹规划。

Abstract: In this paper, we create optimal, collision-free, time-dependent trajectories
through cluttered dynamic environments. The many spatial and temporal
constraints make finding an initial guess for a numerical solver difficult.
Graphs of Convex Sets (GCS) and the recently developed Space-Time Graphs of
Convex Sets formulation (ST-GCS) enable us to generate optimal minimum distance
collision-free trajectories without providing an initial guess to the solver.
We also explore the derivation of general GCS-compatible constraints and
document an intuitive strategy for adapting general constraints to the
framework. We show that ST-GCS produces equivalent trajectories to the standard
GCS formulation when the environment is static. We then show ST-GCS operating
in dynamic environments to find minimum distance collision-free trajectories.

Abstract: Robust bipedal locomotion in exoskeletons requires the ability to dynamically
react to changes in the environment in real time. This paper introduces the
hybrid data-driven predictive control (HDDPC) framework, an extension of the
data-enabled predictive control, that addresses these challenges by
simultaneously planning foot contact schedules and continuous domain
trajectories. The proposed framework utilizes a Hankel matrix-based
representation to model system dynamics, incorporating step-to-step (S2S)
transitions to enhance adaptability in dynamic environments. By integrating
contact scheduling with trajectory planning, the framework offers an efficient,
unified solution for locomotion motion synthesis that enables robust and
reactive walking through online replanning. We validate the approach on the
Atalante exoskeleton, demonstrating improved robustness and adaptability.

Result: 实验表明，ReconVLA在模拟和真实环境中均表现出精确操作和泛化能力。

Conclusion: ReconVLA通过隐式接地方法有效提升了视觉-语言-动作模型的性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have enabled robotic
agents to integrate multimodal understanding with action execution. However,
our empirical analysis reveals that current VLAs struggle to allocate visual
attention to target regions. Instead, visual attention is always dispersed. To
guide the visual attention grounding on the correct target, we propose
ReconVLA, a reconstructive VLA model with an implicit grounding paradigm.
Conditioned on the model's visual outputs, a diffusion transformer aims to
reconstruct the gaze region of the image, which corresponds to the target
manipulated objects. This process prompts the VLA model to learn fine-grained
representations and accurately allocate visual attention, thus effectively
leveraging task-specific visual information and conducting precise
manipulation. Moreover, we curate a large-scale pretraining dataset comprising
over 100k trajectories and 2 million data samples from open-source robotic
datasets, further boosting the model's generalization in visual reconstruction.
Extensive experiments in simulation and the real world demonstrate the
superiority of our implicit grounding method, showcasing its capabilities of
precise manipulation and generalization. Our project page is

Conclusion: BEASST通过智能不确定性驱动导航，在理论和实践中均表现出色，为复杂环境中的源搜索提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents BEASST (Behavioral Entropic Gradient-based Adaptive
Source Seeking for Mobile Robots), a novel framework for robotic source seeking
in complex, unknown environments. Our approach enables mobile robots to
efficiently balance exploration and exploitation by modeling normalized signal
strength as a surrogate probability of source location. Building on Behavioral
Entropy(BE) with Prelec's probability weighting function, we define an
objective function that adapts robot behavior from risk-averse to risk-seeking
based on signal reliability and mission urgency. The framework provides
theoretical convergence guarantees under unimodal signal assumptions and
practical stability under bounded disturbances. Experimental validation across
DARPA SubT and multi-room scenarios demonstrates that BEASST consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 15% reduction in path length
and 20% faster source localization through intelligent uncertainty-driven
navigation that dynamically transitions between aggressive pursuit and cautious

Result: 在四个HAR数据集和五种不同设置下的实验证明了方法的优越性。

Conclusion: FAVOR方法通过视觉强化学习显著提升了少样本识别的性能，并增强了模型的可解释性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning in large reasoning models enables learning from
feedback on their outputs, making it particularly valuable in scenarios where
fine-tuning data is limited. However, its application in multi-modal human
activity recognition (HAR) domains remains largely underexplored. Our work
extends reinforcement learning to the human activity recognition domain with
multimodal large language models. By incorporating visual reinforcement
learning in the training process, the model's generalization ability on
few-shot recognition can be greatly improved. Additionally, visual
reinforcement learning can enhance the model's reasoning ability and enable
explainable analysis in the inference stage. We name our few-shot human
activity recognition method with visual reinforcement learning FAVOR.
Specifically, our approach first utilizes a multimodal large language model
(MLLM) to generate multiple candidate responses for the human activity image,
each containing reasoning traces and final answers. These responses are then
evaluated using reward functions, and the MLLM model is subsequently optimized
using the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm. In this way, the
MLLM model can be adapted to human activity recognition with only a few
samples. Extensive experiments on four human activity recognition datasets and
five different settings demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.

Conclusion: 该框架提升了外骨骼在家庭护理场景中的适应性和安全性。

Abstract: Upper-limb exoskeletons are primarily designed to provide assistive support
by accurately interpreting and responding to human intentions. In home-care
scenarios, exoskeletons are expected to adapt their assistive configurations
based on the semantic information of the task, adjusting appropriately in
accordance with the nature of the object being manipulated. However, existing
solutions often lack the ability to understand task semantics or
collaboratively plan actions with the user, limiting their generalizability. To
address this challenge, this paper introduces a semantic-aware framework that
integrates large language models into the task planning framework, enabling the
delivery of safe and intent-integrative assistance. The proposed approach
begins with the exoskeleton operating in transparent mode to capture the
wearer's intent during object grasping. Once semantic information is extracted
from the task description, the system automatically configures appropriate
assistive parameters. In addition, a diffusion-based anomaly detector is used
to continuously monitor the state of human-robot interaction and trigger
real-time replanning in response to detected anomalies. During task execution,
online trajectory refinement and impedance control are used to ensure safety
and regulate human-robot interaction. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed method effectively aligns with the wearer's cognition, adapts to
semantically varying tasks, and responds reliably to anomalies.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种从稀疏LiDAR数据生成密集反射图像的新框架，解决了低成本LiDAR因数据稀疏性应用受限的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉依赖被动光学感知，而主动光学感知（如LiDAR）因技术发展重新定义视觉边界。低成本LiDAR数据稀疏性限制了其广泛应用。

Method: 利用非重复扫描LiDAR（NRS-LiDAR）特性，提出反射校准和动态场景转换方法，构建密集反射图像生成框架。

Result: 贡献包括LiDAR反射图像密集化数据集、NRS-LiDAR专用密集化网络，以及闭环检测和车道检测等应用。

Conclusion: 该框架为低成本LiDAR的广泛应用提供了新途径，推动了主动视觉的发展。

Abstract: Conventionally, human intuition often defines vision as a modality of passive
optical sensing, while active optical sensing is typically regarded as
measuring rather than the default modality of vision. However, the situation
now changes: sensor technologies and data-driven paradigms empower active
optical sensing to redefine the boundaries of vision, ushering in a new era of
active vision. Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors capture reflectance
from object surfaces, which remains invariant under varying illumination
conditions, showcasing significant potential in robotic perception tasks such
as detection, recognition, segmentation, and Simultaneous Localization and
Mapping (SLAM). These applications often rely on dense sensing capabilities,
typically achieved by high-resolution, expensive LiDAR sensors. A key challenge
with low-cost LiDARs lies in the sparsity of scan data, which limits their
broader application. To address this limitation, this work introduces an
innovative framework for generating dense LiDAR reflectance images from sparse
data, leveraging the unique attributes of non-repeating scanning LiDAR
(NRS-LiDAR). We tackle critical challenges, including reflectance calibration
and the transition from static to dynamic scene domains, facilitating the
reconstruction of dense reflectance images in real-world settings. The key
contributions of this work include a comprehensive dataset for LiDAR
reflectance image densification, a densification network tailored for
NRS-LiDAR, and diverse applications such as loop closure and traffic lane
detection using the generated dense reflectance images.

Abstract: Embodied AI aims to develop intelligent systems with physical forms capable

embodied AI by enhancing perception, interaction, planning and learning. In
this article, we provide a comprehensive survey on large model empowered
embodied AI, focusing on autonomous decision-making and embodied learning. We
investigate both hierarchical and end-to-end decision-making paradigms,
detailing how large models enhance high-level planning, low-level execution,

Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for end-to-end decision making. For
embodied learning, we introduce mainstream learning methodologies, elaborating
on how large models enhance imitation learning and reinforcement learning
in-depth. For the first time, we integrate world models into the survey of
embodied AI, presenting their design methods and critical roles in enhancing
decision-making and learning. Though solid advances have been achieved,
challenges still exist, which are discussed at the end of this survey,
potentially as the further research directions.

Conclusion: Self-correction Flywheel范式显著提升了模型的错误校正能力和性能，适用于动态障碍物避障和长指令跟随。

Abstract: Existing vision-and-language navigation models often deviate from the correct
trajectory when executing instructions. However, these models lack effective
error correction capability, hindering their recovery from errors. To address
this challenge, we propose Self-correction Flywheel, a novel post-training
paradigm. Instead of considering the model's error trajectories on the training
set as a drawback, our paradigm emphasizes their significance as a valuable
data source. We have developed a method to identify deviations in these error
trajectories and devised innovative techniques to automatically generate
self-correction data for perception and action. These self-correction data
serve as fuel to power the model's continued training. The brilliance of our
paradigm is revealed when we re-evaluate the model on the training set,
uncovering new error trajectories. At this time, the self-correction flywheel
begins to spin. Through multiple flywheel iterations, we progressively enhance
our monocular RGB-based VLA navigation model CorrectNav. Experiments on R2R-CE
and RxR-CE benchmarks show CorrectNav achieves new state-of-the-art success
rates of 65.1% and 69.3%, surpassing prior best VLA navigation models by 8.2%
and 16.4%. Real robot tests in various indoor and outdoor environments
demonstrate \method's superior capability of error correction, dynamic obstacle
avoidance, and long instruction following.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel method to enhance locomotion for a single
humanoid robot through cooperative-heterogeneous multi-agent deep reinforcement
learning (MARL). While most existing methods typically employ single-agent
reinforcement learning algorithms for a single humanoid robot or MARL
algorithms for multi-robot system tasks, we propose a distinct paradigm:
applying cooperative-heterogeneous MARL to optimize locomotion for a single
humanoid robot. The proposed method, multi-agent reinforcement learning for
single humanoid locomotion (MASH), treats each limb (legs and arms) as an
independent agent that explores the robot's action space while sharing a global
critic for cooperative learning. Experiments demonstrate that MASH accelerates
training convergence and improves whole-body cooperation ability, outperforming
conventional single-agent reinforcement learning methods. This work advances
the integration of MARL into single-humanoid-robot control, offering new
insights into efficient locomotion strategies.

Abstract: Developing robotic algorithms and integrating a robotic subsystem into a
larger system can be a difficult task. Particularly in small and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs) where robotics expertise is lacking, implementing,
maintaining and developing robotic systems can be a challenge. As a result,
many companies rely on external expertise through system integrators, which, in
some cases, can lead to vendor lock-in and external dependency. In the academic
research on intelligent manufacturing systems, robots play a critical role in
the design of robust autonomous systems. Similar challenges are faced by
researchers who want to use robotic systems as a component in a larger smart
system, without having to deal with the complexity and vastness of the robot
interfaces in detail. In this paper, we propose a software framework that
reduces the effort required to deploy a working robotic system. The focus is
solely on providing a concept for simplifying the different interfaces of a
modern robot system and using an abstraction layer for different manufacturers
and models. The Python programming language is used to implement a prototype of
the concept. The target system is a bin-picking cell containing a Yaskawa
Motoman GP4.

Motivation: 解决Diffusion Policy在机器人策略执行中可能偏离数据分布的问题，包括去噪过程的随机性和对数据异常值的学习。

Method: 使用核密度估计（KDE）和流形感知核，对机器人动作轨迹进行概率密度建模，过滤有害轨迹。

Result: 在模拟单臂任务和真实机器人实验中，KDPE性能优于Diffusion Policy。

Conclusion: KDPE通过核密度估计有效提升了机器人策略的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Learning robot policies that capture multimodality in the training data has
been a long-standing open challenge for behavior cloning. Recent approaches
tackle the problem by modeling the conditional action distribution with
generative models. One of these approaches is Diffusion Policy, which relies on
a diffusion model to denoise random points into robot action trajectories.
While achieving state-of-the-art performance, it has two main drawbacks that
may lead the robot out of the data distribution during policy execution. First,
the stochasticity of the denoising process can highly impact on the quality of
generated trajectory of actions. Second, being a supervised learning approach,
it can learn data outliers from the dataset used for training. Recent work
focuses on mitigating these limitations by combining Diffusion Policy either
with large-scale training or with classical behavior cloning algorithms.
Instead, we propose KDPE, a Kernel Density Estimation-based strategy that
filters out potentially harmful trajectories output of Diffusion Policy while
keeping a low test-time computational overhead. For Kernel Density Estimation,
we propose a manifold-aware kernel to model a probability density function for
actions composed of end-effector Cartesian position, orientation, and gripper
state. KDPE overall achieves better performance than Diffusion Policy on
simulated single-arm tasks and real robot experiments.

Conclusion: MLM框架有效解决了多任务操控问题，并在真实环境中表现出色。

Abstract: Whole-body loco-manipulation for quadruped robots with arm remains a
challenging problem, particularly in achieving multi-task control. To address
this, we propose MLM, a reinforcement learning framework driven by both
real-world and simulation data. It enables a six-DoF robotic arm--equipped
quadruped robot to perform whole-body loco-manipulation for multiple tasks
autonomously or under human teleoperation. To address the problem of balancing
multiple tasks during the learning of loco-manipulation, we introduce a
trajectory library with an adaptive, curriculum-based sampling mechanism. This
approach allows the policy to efficiently leverage real-world collected
trajectories for learning multi-task loco-manipulation. To address deployment
scenarios with only historical observations and to enhance the performance of
policy execution across tasks with different spatial ranges, we propose a
Trajectory-Velocity Prediction policy network. It predicts unobservable future
trajectories and velocities. By leveraging extensive simulation data and
curriculum-based rewards, our controller achieves whole-body behaviors in
simulation and zero-shot transfer to real-world deployment. Ablation studies in
simulation verify the necessity and effectiveness of our approach, while
real-world experiments on the Go2 robot with an Airbot robotic arm demonstrate
the policy's good performance in multi-task execution.

Motivation: 尽管LLMs提升了人机交互质量，但与人人交互相比仍存在不足，且失败案例因情境而异，难以泛化。

Method: 提出使用民族志小故事记录和展示HRI中的失败案例，特别是罕见或未记录的案例。

Result: 小故事能多学科视角揭示失败、提升机器人能力透明度，并记录研究中遗漏的意外行为。

Conclusion: 建议用小故事补充现有交互评估方法，以更全面地理解HRI中的问题。

Abstract: Although the quality of human-robot interactions has improved with the advent
of LLMs, there are still various factors that cause systems to be sub-optimal
when compared to human-human interactions. The nature and criticality of
failures are often dependent on the context of the interaction and so cannot be
generalized across the wide range of scenarios and experiments which have been
implemented in HRI research. In this work we propose the use of a technique
overlooked in the field of HRI, ethnographic vignettes, to clearly highlight
these failures, particularly those that are rarely documented. We describe the
methodology behind the process of writing vignettes and create our own based on
our personal experiences with failures in HRI systems. We emphasize the
strength of vignettes as the ability to communicate failures from a
multi-disciplinary perspective, promote transparency about the capabilities of
robots, and document unexpected behaviours which would otherwise be omitted
from research reports. We encourage the use of vignettes to augment existing
interaction evaluation methods.

the deployment of such black-box approaches remains challenging for heavy-duty
wheeled mobile robots (WMRs), which are subject to strict international
standards and prone to faults and disturbances. We designed a hierarchical
control policy for heavy-duty WMRs, monitored by two safety layers with
differing levels of authority. To this end, a DNN policy was trained and
deployed as the primary control strategy, providing high-precision performance
under nominal operating conditions. When external disturbances arise and reach
a level of intensity such that the system performance falls below a predefined
threshold, a low-level safety layer intervenes by deactivating the primary
control policy and activating a model-free robust adaptive control (RAC)
policy. This transition enables the system to continue operating while ensuring
stability by effectively managing the inherent trade-off between system
robustness and responsiveness. Regardless of the control policy in use, a
high-level safety layer continuously monitors system performance during
operation. It initiates a shutdown only when disturbances become sufficiently
severe such that compensation is no longer viable and continued operation would
jeopardize the system or its environment. The proposed synthesis of DNN and RAC
policy guarantees uniform exponential stability of the entire WMR system while
adhering to safety standards to some extent. The effectiveness of the proposed
approach was further validated through real-time experiments using a 6,000 kg
WMR.

Abstract: Soft robots, particularly magnetic soft robots, require specialized
simulation tools to accurately model their deformation under external magnetic
fields. However, existing platforms often lack dedicated support for magnetic
materials, making them difficult to use for researchers at different expertise
levels. This work introduces an open-source, user-friendly simulation interface
using the Simulation Open Framework Architecture (SOFA), specifically designed
to model magnetic soft robots. The tool enables users to define material
properties, apply magnetic fields, and observe resulting deformations in real
time. By integrating intuitive controls and stress analysis capabilities, it
aims to bridge the gap between theoretical modeling and practical design. Four
benchmark models - a beam, three- and four-finger grippers, and a butterfly -
demonstrate its functionality. The software's ease of use makes it accessible
to both beginners and advanced researchers. Future improvements will refine
accuracy through experimental validation and comparison with industry-standard
finite element solvers, ensuring realistic and predictive simulations of
magnetic soft robots.

Result: 实验表明，该方法能显著影响机器人在探索过程中的行为，提高探索效率。

Conclusion: 通过引入显著性区域的概念，可以更有效地指导机器人探索未知环境。

Abstract: Autonomous exploration is a widely studied problem where a robot
incrementally builds a map of a previously unknown environment. The robot
selects the next locations to reach using an exploration strategy. To do so,
the robot has to balance between competing objectives, like exploring the
entirety of the environment, while being as fast as possible. Most exploration
strategies try to maximise the explored area to speed up exploration; however,
they do not consider that parts of the environment are more important than
others, as they lead to the discovery of large unknown areas. We propose a
method that identifies \emph{saliency areas} as those areas that are of high
interest for exploration, by using saliency maps obtained from a neural network
that, given the current map, implements a termination criterion to estimate
whether the environment can be considered fully-explored or not. We use
saliency areas to bias some widely used exploration strategies, showing, with
an extensive experimental campaign, that this knowledge can significantly
influence the behavior of the robot during exploration.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自动学习任务堆叠（SoT）层次和参数的新框架，结合强化学习和遗传编程，无需人工干预即可发现任务优先级和控制策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Result: 在移动-YuMi平台上验证，结果表明学习到的SoT能动态适应环境变化，平衡竞争目标并保持稳健任务执行。

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂机器人冗余管理提供了通用且用户友好的解决方案，减少了对专家设计的依赖。

Abstract: Modern robotic systems, such as mobile manipulators, humanoids, and aerial
robots with arms, often possess high redundancy, enabling them to perform
multiple tasks simultaneously. Managing this redundancy is key to achieving
reliable and flexible behavior. A widely used approach is the Stack of Tasks
(SoT), which organizes control objectives by priority within a unified
framework. However, traditional SoTs are manually designed by experts, limiting
their adaptability and accessibility. This paper introduces a novel framework
that automatically learns both the hierarchy and parameters of a SoT from
user-defined objectives. By combining Reinforcement Learning and Genetic
Programming, the system discovers task priorities and control strategies
without manual intervention. A cost function based on intuitive metrics such as
precision, safety, and execution time guides the learning process. We validate
our method through simulations and experiments on the mobile-YuMi platform, a
dual-arm mobile manipulator with high redundancy. Results show that the learned
SoTs enable the robot to dynamically adapt to changing environments and inputs,
balancing competing objectives while maintaining robust task execution. This
approach provides a general and user-friendly solution for redundancy
management in complex robots, advancing human-centered robot programming and
reducing the need for expert design.

Motivation: 自主系统的部署引发了对安全性和可靠性的担忧，尤其是感知失败可能导致事故，影响公众信任。

Method: 引入SET框架，使用SET状态树和因素树分类和建模感知任务中的不确定性，并开发感知因素模型量化风险。

Result: SET框架提供了一种透明、标准化的方法，用于识别、建模和传达感知风险。

Conclusion: 该框架旨在提升自主系统的安全保证，并通过透明化方法增强公众信任。

Abstract: Future autonomous systems promise significant societal benefits, yet their
deployment raises concerns about safety and trustworthiness. A key concern is
assuring the reliability of robot perception, as perception seeds safe
decision-making. Failures in perception are often due to complex yet common
environmental factors and can lead to accidents that erode public trust. To
address this concern, we introduce the SET (Self, Environment, and Target)
Perceptual Factors Framework. We designed the framework to systematically
analyze how factors such as weather, occlusion, or sensor limitations
negatively impact perception. To achieve this, the framework employs SET State
Trees to categorize where such factors originate and SET Factor Trees to model
how these sources and factors impact perceptual tasks like object detection or
pose estimation. Next, we develop Perceptual Factor Models using both trees to
quantify the uncertainty for a given task. Our framework aims to promote
rigorous safety assurances and cultivate greater public understanding and trust
in autonomous systems by offering a transparent and standardized method for
identifying, modeling, and communicating perceptual risks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于情感识别文献的多模态注意力网络，用于建模人类与机器人互动中的主观自我披露行为，并通过新的损失函数显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着社交机器人在多种社交场景中与人类协作的需求增加，准确建模人类与机器人互动中的自我披露行为变得尤为重要。

Method: 开发了一种多模态注意力网络，基于情感识别模型，使用自收集的视频语料库训练，并设计了新的尺度保持交叉熵损失函数。

Result: 最佳模型在F1分数上达到0.83，比基线模型提升了0.48。

Conclusion: 该研究为社交机器人识别互动中的自我披露行为提供了重要进展，对社交认知能力的机器人至关重要。

Abstract: Subjective self-disclosure is an important feature of human social
interaction. While much has been done in the social and behavioural literature
to characterise the features and consequences of subjective self-disclosure,
little work has been done thus far to develop computational systems that are
able to accurately model it. Even less work has been done that attempts to
model specifically how human interactants self-disclose with robotic partners.
It is becoming more pressing as we require social robots to work in conjunction
with and establish relationships with humans in various social settings. In
this paper, our aim is to develop a custom multimodal attention network based
on models from the emotion recognition literature, training this model on a
large self-collected self-disclosure video corpus, and constructing a new loss
function, the scale preserving cross entropy loss, that improves upon both
classification and regression versions of this problem. Our results show that
the best performing model, trained with our novel loss function, achieves an F1
score of 0.83, an improvement of 0.48 from the best baseline model. This result
makes significant headway in the aim of allowing social robots to pick up on an
interaction partner's self-disclosures, an ability that will be essential in
social robots with social cognition.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于李群的紧密耦合视觉-惯性-测距里程计系统（CVIRO），通过将UWB锚点状态纳入系统状态并显式处理校准不确定性，提高了定位的一致性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UWB辅助的VIO系统存在不一致性问题，主要源于系统可观测性未正确保持和UWB锚点位置假设已知导致校准不确定性被忽略。

Method: 提出CVIRO系统，将UWB锚点状态纳入系统状态，利用李群的不变性误差特性确保可观测一致性，并通过理论证明系统正确保持不可观测子空间。

Result: 仿真和实验表明，CVIRO在定位精度和一致性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CVIRO通过联合估计机器人和锚点状态，显式处理校准不确定性，显著提升了UWB辅助VIO系统的性能。

Abstract: Ultra Wideband (UWB) is widely used to mitigate drift in visual-inertial
odometry (VIO) systems. Consistency is crucial for ensuring the estimation
accuracy of a UWBaided VIO system. An inconsistent estimator can degrade
localization performance, where the inconsistency primarily arises from two
main factors: (1) the estimator fails to preserve the correct system
observability, and (2) UWB anchor positions are assumed to be known, leading to
improper neglect of calibration uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a
consistent and tightly-coupled visual-inertial-ranging odometry (CVIRO) system
based on the Lie group. Our method incorporates the UWB anchor state into the
system state, explicitly accounting for UWB calibration uncertainty and
enabling the joint and consistent estimation of both robot and anchor states.
Furthermore, observability consistency is ensured by leveraging the invariant
error properties of the Lie group. We analytically prove that the CVIRO
algorithm naturally maintains the system's correct unobservable subspace,
thereby preserving estimation consistency. Extensive simulations and
experiments demonstrate that CVIRO achieves superior localization accuracy and
consistency compared to existing methods.

*Anantha Narayanan,Battu Bhanu Teja,Pruthwik Mishra*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于强化学习（A2C算法）的框架，用于优化低地球轨道卫星的轨道参数，以实现精确的地面覆盖，并减少碰撞风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低地球轨道（LEO）的日益拥堵对地球观测卫星的高效部署和安全运行提出了持续挑战，需要优化轨道参数以应对碰撞风险。

Method: 通过将问题建模为马尔可夫决策过程（MDP），在自定义的OpenAI Gymnasium环境中使用A2C算法调整轨道参数（如半长轴、偏心率等），以实现目标覆盖。

Result: A2C算法在累积奖励（10.0 vs 9.263025）和收敛速度（2,000 vs 63,000时间步）上显著优于PPO算法，且适用于实时任务规划。

Conclusion: 该方法验证了强化学习在连续轨道控制中的高效性，为智能化的LEO任务规划提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: The increasing congestion of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) poses persistent
challenges to the efficient deployment and safe operation of Earth observation
satellites. Mission planners must now account not only for mission-specific
requirements but also for the increasing collision risk with active satellites
and space debris. This work presents a reinforcement learning framework using
the Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) algorithm to optimize satellite orbital
parameters for precise terrestrial coverage within predefined surface radii. By
formulating the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) within a custom
OpenAI Gymnasium environment, our method simulates orbital dynamics using
classical Keplerian elements. The agent progressively learns to adjust five of
the orbital parameters - semi-major axis, eccentricity, inclination, right
ascension of ascending node, and the argument of perigee-to achieve targeted
terrestrial coverage. Comparative evaluation against Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) demonstrates A2C's superior performance, achieving 5.8x
higher cumulative rewards (10.0 vs 9.263025) while converging in 31.5x fewer
timesteps (2,000 vs 63,000). The A2C agent consistently meets mission
objectives across diverse target coordinates while maintaining computational
efficiency suitable for real-time mission planning applications. Key
contributions include: (1) a TLE-based orbital simulation environment
incorporating physics constraints, (2) validation of actor-critic methods'
superiority over trust region approaches in continuous orbital control, and (3)
demonstration of rapid convergence enabling adaptive satellite deployment. This
approach establishes reinforcement learning as a computationally efficient
alternative for scalable and intelligent LEO mission planning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASR模型广泛应用，但易受对抗攻击，研究旨在验证攻击的鲁棒性并探索防御方法。

Method: 通过放松优化目标（从完全抑制到部分抑制）提高攻击隐蔽性，并测试低通滤波器防御效果。

Result: 部分抑制攻击可降低隐蔽性，低通滤波器可能成为有效防御手段。

Conclusion: 对抗攻击对ASR模型构成威胁，但通过优化攻击方式和防御手段可缓解风险。

Abstract: Currently, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models are deployed in an
extensive range of applications. However, recent studies have demonstrated the
possibility of adversarial attack on these models which could potentially
suppress or disrupt model output. We investigate and verify the robustness of
these attacks and explore if it is possible to increase their imperceptibility.
We additionally find that by relaxing the optimisation objective from complete
suppression to partial suppression, we can further decrease the
imperceptibility of the attack. We also explore possible defences against these
attacks and show a low-pass filter defence could potentially serve as an
effective defence.

TL;DR: 提出一种通用的物理机制，解释1/f波动的普遍性，基于调幅（AM）和解调（DM），并通过声学案例验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 1/f波动广泛存在于多种系统中，但其普遍性缺乏统一的物理机制解释。

Method: 通过扩展Kuramoto模型模拟随机同步和频率选择性共振，生成所需的调幅信号，再通过解调得到1/f频谱。

Result: 数值模拟显示，两种机制单独或组合均能稳定产生1/f频谱，且无需经典Kuramoto临界点。

Conclusion: 解调是产生1/f波动的通用途径，解释了其在自然和工程系统中的普遍性。

Abstract: We propose a universal physical mechanism for the emergence of 1/f
fluctuations, observed across a wide range of systems. In particular, we verify
this on acoustic cases. The mechanism is based on amplitude modulation (AM) and
demodulation (DM), where the 1/f spectral law arises not in the raw waveform
but in its demodulated amplitude envelope. Two distinct yet complementary
processes generate the required AM: (i) stochastic synchronization among
oscillators, modeled via an extended Kuramoto framework that captures perpetual
synchronization-desynchronization cycles, and (ii) frequency-selective
resonance, modeled by spectral accumulation of eigenmodes in acoustic or
structural environments. Numerical simulations demonstrate that both
mechanisms, acting separately or in combination, robustly produce 1/f spectra
over several decades when DM is applied, and that the classical Kuramoto
critical point is not necessary for their emergence. We demonstrate the
cross-domain relevance of this AM/DM framework through analyses of musical
performances, seismic records, and astrophysical time series, revealing a
common underlying structure. This work establishes demodulation as a general
route to 1/f fluctuations, providing a simple and scalable explanation for its
ubiquity in both natural and engineered systems.
  Keywords: 1/f fluctuation, amplitude modulation, synchronization, resonance,

Result: 未经微调的模型表现不如微调的AlexNet；ResNet能有效分离背景音；微调后模型在背景音较少时表现更好。

Conclusion: 强调微调预训练模型的必要性，并建议检查微调后的嵌入特征。

Abstract: Bioacoustics, the study of animal sounds, offers a non-invasive method to
monitor ecosystems. Extracting embeddings from audio-pretrained deep learning
(DL) models without fine-tuning has become popular for obtaining bioacoustic
features for tasks. However, a recent benchmark study reveals that while
fine-tuned audio-pretrained VGG and transformer models achieve state-of-the-art
performance in some tasks, they fail in others. This study benchmarks 11 DL
models on the same tasks by reducing their learned embeddings' dimensionality
and evaluating them through clustering. We found that audio-pretrained DL
models 1) without fine-tuning even underperform fine-tuned AlexNet, 2) both
with and without fine-tuning fail to separate the background from labeled
sounds, but ResNet does, and 3) outperform other models when fewer background
sounds are included during fine-tuning. This study underscores the necessity of
fine-tuning audio-pretrained models and checking the embeddings after
fine-tuning. Our codes are available:

Motivation: 现有数据集缺乏公开性、完整性和听力相关标签，且模型在边缘设备上的部署存在挑战。

Method: 结合多个开源数据集创建AHEAD-DS，并开发YAMNet+模型，基于YAMNet进行迁移学习。

Conclusion: AHEAD-DS和YAMNet+为听力设备场景识别提供了标准化数据和基线模型，适用于边缘设备。

Abstract: Scene recognition of audiologically relevant environments is important for
hearing aids; however, it is challenging, in part because of the limitations of
existing datasets. Datasets often lack public accessibility, completeness, or
audiologically relevant labels, hindering systematic comparison of machine
learning models. Deploying these models on resource-constrained edge devices
presents another challenge. Our solution is two-fold: we leverage several open
source datasets to create AHEAD-DS, a dataset designed for scene recognition of
audiologically relevant environments, and introduce YAMNet+, a sound
recognition model. AHEAD-DS aims to provide a standardised, publicly available
dataset with consistent labels relevant to hearing aids, facilitating model
comparison. YAMNet+ is designed for deployment on edge devices like smartphones
connected to hearing devices, such as hearing aids and wireless earphones with
hearing aid functionality; serving as a baseline model for sound-based scene
recognition. YAMNet+ achieved a mean average precision of 0.83 and accuracy of
0.93 on the testing set of AHEAD-DS across fourteen categories of
audiologically relevant environments. We found that applying transfer learning
from the pretrained YAMNet model was essential. We demonstrated real-time
sound-based scene recognition capabilities on edge devices by deploying YAMNet+
to an Android smartphone. Even with a Google Pixel 3 (a phone with modest
specifications, released in 2018), the model processes audio with approximately
50ms of latency to load the model, and an approximate linear increase of 30ms
per 1 second of audio. Our website and code

Motivation: 构音障碍患者因发音器官运动控制障碍导致语音清晰度下降，难以录制足够的高质量语音数据，限制了个性化语音合成的可行性。

Result: 实验表明，该模型能有效生成发音错误减少、说话人保真度高且韵律自然的合成语音。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为零样本个性化语音合成提供了可行解决方案，尤其适用于数据稀缺的构音障碍患者。

Abstract: Dysarthric speakers experience substantial communication challenges due to
impaired motor control of the speech apparatus, which leads to reduced speech
intelligibility. This creates significant obstacles in dataset curation since
actual recording of long, articulate sentences for the objective of training
personalized TTS models becomes infeasible. Thus, the limited availability of
audio data, in addition to the articulation errors that are present within the
audio, complicates personalized speech synthesis for target dysarthric speaker
adaptation. To address this, we frame the issue as a domain transfer task and
introduce a knowledge anchoring framework that leverages a teacher-student
model, enhanced by curriculum learning through audio augmentation. Experimental
results show that the proposed zero-shot multi-speaker TTS model effectively
generates synthetic speech with markedly reduced articulation errors and high
speaker fidelity, while maintaining prosodic naturalness.

Result: 交替使用两种模型显著提升了语音质量，并通过图形分析展示了其优势。

Conclusion: PuttNet能有效减少语音增强模型的伪影，交替使用两种模型是提升语音质量的有效方法。

Abstract: Speech enhancement using artificial neural networks aims to remove noise from
noisy speech signals while preserving the speech content. However, speech
enhancement networks often introduce distortions to the speech signal, referred
to as artifacts, which can degrade audio quality. In this work, we propose a
post-processing neural network designed to mitigate artifacts introduced by
speech enhancement models. Inspired by the analogy of making a `Putt' after an
`Approach' in golf, we name our model PuttNet. We demonstrate that alternating
between a speech enhancement model and the proposed Putt model leads to
improved speech quality, as measured by perceptual quality scores (PESQ),
objective intelligibility (STOI), and background noise intrusiveness (CBAK)
scores. Furthermore, we illustrate with graphical analysis why this alternating
Approach outperforms repeated application of either model alone.

automatic motive segmentation in Korean folk songs by fine-tuning a speech
transcription model on audio lyric with motif boundary annotation. Applying
this to 856 songs, we extracted motif count and duration entropy as structural

according to the social function of the songs. Songs associated with collective
labor, for instance, showed different structural patterns from those for
entertainment or personal settings. This work offers a scalable approach for
quantitative structural analysis of oral music traditions.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of speech generation technology has led to the
widespread proliferation of deepfake speech across social media platforms.
While deepfake audio countermeasures (CMs) achieve promising results on public
datasets, their performance degrades significantly in cross-domain scenarios.
To advance CMs for real-world deepfake detection, we first propose the Fake
Speech Wild (FSW) dataset, which includes 254 hours of real and deepfake audio
from four different media platforms, focusing on social media. As CMs, we
establish a benchmark using public datasets and advanced selfsupervised
learning (SSL)-based CMs to evaluate current CMs in real-world scenarios. We
also assess the effectiveness of data augmentation strategies in enhancing CM
robustness for detecting deepfake speech on social media. Finally, by
augmenting public datasets and incorporating the FSW training set, we
significantly advanced real-world deepfake audio detection performance,
achieving an average equal error rate (EER) of 3.54% across all evaluation
sets.

Abstract: The field of speech separation, addressing the "cocktail party problem", has
seen revolutionary advances with DNNs. Speech separation enhances clarity in
complex acoustic environments and serves as crucial pre-processing for speech
recognition and speaker recognition. However, current literature focuses
narrowly on specific architectures or isolated approaches, creating fragmented
understanding. This survey addresses this gap by providing systematic
examination of DNN-based speech separation techniques. Our work differentiates
itself through: (I) Comprehensive perspective: We systematically investigate
learning paradigms, separation scenarios with known/unknown speakers,
comparative analysis of supervised/self-supervised/unsupervised frameworks, and
architectural components from encoders to estimation strategies. (II)
Timeliness: Coverage of cutting-edge developments ensures access to current
innovations and benchmarks. (III) Unique insights: Beyond summarization, we
evaluate technological trajectories, identify emerging patterns, and highlight
promising directions including domain-robust frameworks, efficient
architectures, multimodal integration, and novel self-supervised paradigms.
(IV) Fair evaluation: We provide quantitative evaluations on standard datasets,
revealing true capabilities and limitations of different methods. This
comprehensive survey serves as an accessible reference for experienced
researchers and newcomers navigating speech separation's complex landscape.

TL;DR: 提出了一种贝叶斯框架，用于在具有自相关误差的线性回归中进行变量选择，适用于滞后协变量和自回归结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决时间序列应用中响应变量依赖于同期或过去解释变量及持久随机冲击的问题，如金融建模、水文预测和气象应用。

Method: 采用分层贝叶斯模型和spike-and-slab先验，提出高效的两阶段MCMC算法分离变量选择与参数采样。

Result: 理论分析证明后验选择一致性，模拟和实际应用（地下水深度预测、S&P 500对数收益率建模）显示变量选择准确性和预测性能显著提升。

Conclusion: 相比现有方法，该框架在自相关噪声下具有更低的MSPE、更好的模型组件识别和更强的鲁棒性，适用于自回归场景的模型解释和预测。

Abstract: We develop a Bayesian framework for variable selection in linear regression
with autocorrelated errors, accommodating lagged covariates and autoregressive
structures. This setting occurs in time series applications where responses
depend on contemporaneous or past explanatory variables and persistent
stochastic shocks, including financial modeling, hydrological forecasting, and
meteorological applications requiring temporal dependency capture. Our
methodology uses hierarchical Bayesian models with spike-and-slab priors to
simultaneously select relevant covariates and lagged error terms. We propose an
efficient two-stage MCMC algorithm separating sampling of variable inclusion
indicators and model parameters to address high-dimensional computational
challenges. Theoretical analysis establishes posterior selection consistency
under mild conditions, even when candidate predictors grow exponentially with
sample size, common in modern time series with many potential lagged variables.
Through simulations and real applications (groundwater depth prediction, S&P
500 log returns modeling), we demonstrate substantial gains in variable
selection accuracy and predictive performance. Compared to existing methods,
our framework achieves lower MSPE, improved true model component
identification, and greater robustness with autocorrelated noise, underscoring
practical utility for model interpretation and forecasting in autoregressive
settings.

Conclusion: 双神经网络集成方法在喷注分类中表现出色，为高能物理研究提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Jet classification in high-energy particle physics is important for
understanding fundamental interactions and probing phenomena beyond the
Standard Model. Jets originate from the fragmentation and hadronization of
quarks and gluons, and pose a challenge for identification due to their
complex, multidimensional structure. Traditional classification methods often
fall short in capturing these intricacies, necessitating advanced machine
learning approaches. In this paper, we employ two neural networks
simultaneously as an ensemble to tag various jet types. We convert the jet data
to two-dimensional histograms instead of representing them as points in a
higher-dimensional space. Specifically, this ensemble approach, hereafter
referred to as Ensemble Model, is used to tag jets into classes from the JetNet
dataset, corresponding to: Top Quarks, Light Quarks (up or down), and W and Z
bosons. For the jet classes mentioned above, we show that the Ensemble Model
can be used for both binary and multi-categorical classification. This ensemble
approach learns jet features by leveraging the strengths of each constituent
network achieving superior performance compared to either individual network.

*Zhliang Xiang,Meghyn Bienvenu,Gianluca Cima,Víctor Gutiérrez-Basulto,Yazmín Ibáñez-García*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: ASPEN+扩展了ASPEN系统，支持局部合并和新的最优解标准，提升了集体实体解析的灵活性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有系统ASPEN仅支持全局合并，而局部合并在某些场景下更适用，如不同实例的'J. Lee'可能指向不同实体。

Method: ASPEN+引入局部合并功能和新最优解标准（如最小化规则冲突或最大化支持合并的规则数）。

Result: 实验验证了局部合并和新标准对准确性和运行时的积极影响。

Conclusion: ASPEN+通过灵活合并和优化标准，显著提升了集体实体解析的效果。

Abstract: In this paper, we present ASPEN+, which extends an existing ASP-based system,
ASPEN,for collective entity resolution with two important functionalities:
support for local merges and new optimality criteria for preferred solutions.
Indeed, ASPEN only supports so-called global merges of entity-referring
constants (e.g. author ids), in which all occurrences of matched constants are
treated as equivalent and merged accordingly. However, it has been argued that
when resolving data values, local merges are often more appropriate, as e.g.
some instances of 'J. Lee' may refer to 'Joy Lee', while others should be
matched with 'Jake Lee'. In addition to allowing such local merges, ASPEN+
offers new optimality criteria for selecting solutions, such as minimizing rule
violations or maximising the number of rules supporting a merge. Our main
contributions are thus (1) the formalisation and computational analysis of
various notions of optimal solution, and (2) an extensive experimental
evaluation on real-world datasets, demonstrating the effect of local merges and
the new optimality criteria on both accuracy and runtime.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 论文提出了TRMMA和MMA方法，分别用于稀疏轨迹的恢复和地图匹配，显著提升了低采样率轨迹的数据质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的轨迹数据通常稀疏且与路网不对齐，影响了应用性能，因此需要高效的方法来恢复高质量轨迹数据。

Method: MMA通过分类任务将GPS点映射到候选路段，TRMMA则基于MMA结果推断缺失点，利用双Transformer编码和有效解码技术。

Result: 在四个大型真实数据集上，TRMMA和MMA在轨迹恢复和地图匹配任务中表现最佳，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TRMMA和MMA方法能高效且准确地提升稀疏轨迹数据质量，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Real-world trajectories are often sparse with low-sampling rates (i.e., long
intervals between consecutive GPS points) and misaligned with road networks,
yet many applications demand high-quality data for optimal performance. To
improve data quality with sparse trajectories as input, we systematically study
two related research problems: trajectory recovery on road network, which aims
to infer missing points to recover high-sampling trajectories, and map
matching, which aims to map GPS points to road segments to determine underlying
routes. In this paper, we present efficient methods TRMMA and MMA for accurate
trajectory recovery and map matching, respectively, where MMA serves as the
first step of TRMMA. In MMA, we carefully formulate a classification task to
map a GPS point from sparse trajectories to a road segment over a small
candidate segment set, rather than the entire road network. We develop
techniques in MMA to generate effective embeddings that capture the patterns of
GPS data, directional information, and road segments, to accurately align
sparse trajectories to routes. For trajectory recovery, TRMMA focuses on the
segments in the route returned by MMA to infer missing points with position
ratios on road segments, producing high-sampling trajectories efficiently by
avoiding evaluation of all road segments. Specifically, in TRMMA, we design a
dual-transformer encoding process to cohesively capture latent patterns in
trajectories and routes, and an effective decoding technique to sequentially
predict the position ratios and road segments of missing points. We conduct
extensive experiments to compare TRMMA and MMA with numerous existing methods
for trajectory recovery and map matching, respectively, on 4 large real-world
datasets. TRMMA and MMA consistently achieve the best result quality, often by
a significant margin.

Main category: q-fin.PM

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于决策聚焦学习（DFL）的全局最小方差组合（GMVP）优化方法，替代传统的均方误差（MSE）最小化方法，以提升投资决策质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统统计估计和机器学习方法通过最小化MSE确定参数，可能导致次优投资决策。DFL直接优化决策质量，更适合投资组合优化。

Method: 理论推导了GMVP的决策损失梯度，利用其解析解和主成分特性，并通过实证评估验证DFL方法的有效性。

Result: 实证表明，DFL方法在决策性能上优于传统预测聚焦方法，能显著降低波动性并优化投资组合分配。

Conclusion: DFL方法在GMVP构建中表现出色，通过直接优化决策质量，解决了传统方法的局限性，为风险管理提供了更优方案。

Abstract: Portfolio optimization constitutes a cornerstone of risk management by
quantifying the risk-return trade-off. Since it inherently depends on accurate
parameter estimation under conditions of future uncertainty, the selection of
appropriate input parameters is critical for effective portfolio construction.
However, most conventional statistical estimators and machine learning
algorithms determine these parameters by minimizing mean-squared error (MSE), a
criterion that can yield suboptimal investment decisions. In this paper, we
adopt decision-focused learning (DFL) - an approach that directly optimizes
decision quality rather than prediction error such as MSE - to derive the
global minimum-variance portfolio (GMVP). Specifically, we theoretically derive
the gradient of decision loss using the analytic solution of GMVP and its
properties regarding the principal components of itself. Through extensive
empirical evaluation, we show that prediction-focused estimation methods may
fail to produce optimal allocations in practice, whereas DFL-based methods
consistently deliver superior decision performance. Furthermore, we provide a
comprehensive analysis of DFL's mechanism in GMVP construction, focusing on its
volatility reduction capability, decision-driving features, and estimation
characteristics.

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了利用机器学习虚拟传感技术估计IGBT模块焊料层退化状态和温度分布的可行性，取得了高精度的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于内部组件物理不可接近和恶劣环境，直接测量IGBT模块的关键退化指标（如结温、焊料疲劳）具有挑战性，需寻找替代方法。

Method: 基于合成数据，利用机器学习虚拟传感技术，通过有限物理传感器估计焊料退化状态和温度分布。

Result: 焊料退化面积的平均绝对误差为1.17%，IGBT表面温度的最大相对误差为4.56%（平均相对误差0.37%）。

Conclusion: 机器学习虚拟传感技术为IGBT模块退化状态监测提供了高精度且可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Monitoring the degradation state of Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT)
modules is essential for ensuring the reliability and longevity of power
electronic systems, especially in safety-critical and high-performance
applications. However, direct measurement of key degradation indicators - such
as junction temperature, solder fatigue or delamination - remains challenging
due to the physical inaccessibility of internal components and the harsh
environment. In this context, machine learning-based virtual sensing offers a
promising alternative by bridging the gap from feasible sensor placement to the
relevant but inaccessible locations. This paper explores the feasibility of
estimating the degradation state of solder layers, and the corresponding full
temperature maps based on a limited number of physical sensors. Based on
synthetic data of a specific degradation mode, we obtain a high accuracy in the
estimation of the degraded solder area (1.17% mean absolute error), and are
able to reproduce the surface temperature of the IGBT with a maximum relative
error of 4.56% (corresponding to an average relative error of 0.37%).

Main category: physics.comp-ph

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于物理信息的深度对比源反演框架（DeepCSI），用于快速准确地重建不同测量条件下的介质参数，解决了传统反散射问题的非线性和计算成本高的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反散射问题在电磁成像和医学诊断中至关重要，但其非线性和多样化的测量条件使其难以解决。传统方法计算成本高且适应性有限。

Method: 结合对比源反演（CSI）和神经算子方法，使用残差多层感知机（ResMLP）建模感兴趣区域的电流分布，并通过混合损失函数（状态方程损失、数据方程损失和总变分正则化）优化网络参数和介质特性。

Conclusion: DeepCSI为复杂反散射问题提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案，具有简单性和对多样化测量场景的普适建模能力。

Abstract: Inverse scattering problems are critical in electromagnetic imaging and
medical diagnostics but are challenged by their nonlinearity and diverse
measurement scenarios. This paper proposes a physics-informed deep contrast
source inversion framework (DeepCSI) for fast and accurate medium
reconstruction across various measurement conditions. Inspired by contrast
source inversion (CSI) and neural operator methods, a residual multilayer
perceptron (ResMLP) is employed to model current distributions in the region of
interest under different transmitter excitations, effectively linearizing the
nonlinear inverse scattering problem and significantly reducing the
computational cost of traditional full-waveform inversion. By modeling medium
parameters as learnable tensors and utilizing a hybrid loss function that
integrates state equation loss, data equation loss, and total variation
regularization, DeepCSI establishes a fully differentiable framework for joint
optimization of network parameters and medium properties. Compared with
conventional methods, DeepCSI offers advantages in terms of simplicity and
universal modeling capabilities for diverse measurement scenarios, including
phase-less and multi-frequency observation. Simulations and experiments
demonstrate that DeepCSI achieves high-precision, robust reconstruction under
full-data, phaseless data, and multifrequency conditions, outperforming
traditional CSI methods and providing an efficient and universal solution for
complex inverse scattering problems.

Method: 使用SPICE-v2数据集训练等变消息传递架构，评估模型大小、训练数据组成和静电处理对模拟结果的影响。

Result: 大模型在基准数据集上表现更好，但模拟结果不一致；训练数据组成影响预测性质；长程静电作用对Trp-cage增加构象变异性。

Conclusion: 目前不平衡的数据集和不成熟的评估方法限制了通用机器学习势在生物分子模拟中的应用。

Abstract: Universal machine-learned potentials promise transferable accuracy across
compositional and vibrational degrees of freedom, yet their application to
biomolecular simulations remains underexplored. This work systematically
evaluates equivariant message-passing architectures trained on the SPICE-v2
dataset with and without explicit long-range dispersion and electrostatics. We
assess the impact of model size, training data composition, and electrostatic
treatment across in- and out-of-distribution benchmark datasets, as well as
molecular simulations of bulk liquid water, aqueous NaCl solutions, and
biomolecules, including alanine tripeptide, the mini-protein Trp-cage, and
Crambin. While larger models improve accuracy on benchmark datasets, this trend
does not consistently extend to properties obtained from simulations. Predicted
properties also depend on the composition of the training dataset. Long-range
electrostatics show no systematic impact across systems. However, for Trp-cage,
their inclusion yields increased conformational variability. Our results
suggest that imbalanced datasets and immature evaluation practices currently
challenge the applicability of universal machine-learned potentials to
biomolecular simulations.

Motivation: 全球错误信息的传播和对内容可信度的担忧推动了自动化事实核查系统的发展，但仅标记内容为虚假可能无效或加剧偏见，因此需要更全面的解决方案。

Method: 提出一个结合内容、社交媒体和图特征的可解释框架，集成错误信息分类器和解释技术，提供完整且可解释的分类决策支持。

Conclusion: 该框架能有效生成人类可理解的预测解释，提升了事实核查的性能和可信度。

Abstract: The global spread of misinformation and concerns about content
trustworthiness have driven the development of automated fact-checking systems.
Since false information often exploits social media dynamics such as "likes"
and user networks to amplify its reach, effective solutions must go beyond
content analysis to incorporate these factors. Moreover, simply labelling
content as false can be ineffective or even reinforce biases such as automation
and confirmation bias. This paper proposes an explainable framework that
combines content, social media, and graph-based features to enhance
fact-checking. It integrates a misinformation classifier with explainability
techniques to deliver complete and interpretable insights supporting
classification decisions. Experiments demonstrate that multimodal information
improves performance over single modalities, with evaluations conducted on
datasets in English, Spanish, and Portuguese. Additionally, the framework's
explanations were assessed for interpretability, trustworthiness, and
robustness with a novel protocol, showing that it effectively generates
human-understandable justifications for its predictions.

Motivation: 社交媒体数据中非正式语言和俚语的普遍性使得阿片类药物滥用的检测变得困难，需要一种更有效的分析方法。

Method: 研究开发了BERT-BiLSTM-3CNN混合模型（SABIA），包括数据预处理、数据表示、微调阶段和五类用户行为分类。

Result: SABIA模型在实验中表现优异，准确率比基线（逻辑回归）提高了9.30%，并在与其他七项研究的比较中证实了其有效性。

Conclusion: 混合深度学习模型在检测复杂阿片类药物相关行为方面具有潜力，可支持公共卫生监测和干预。

Abstract: Social media platforms have become valuable tools for understanding public
health challenges by offering insights into patient behaviors, medication use,
and mental health issues. However, analyzing such data remains difficult due to
the prevalence of informal language, slang, and coded communication, which can
obscure the detection of opioid misuse. This study addresses the issue of
opioid-related user behavior on social media, including informal expressions,
slang terms, and misspelled or coded language. We analyzed the existing
Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) technique and
developed a BERT-BiLSTM-3CNN hybrid deep learning model, named SABIA, to create
a single-task classifier that effectively captures the features of the target
dataset. The SABIA model demonstrated strong capabilities in capturing
semantics and contextual information. The proposed approach includes: (1) data
preprocessing, (2) data representation using the SABIA model, (3) a fine-tuning
phase, and (4) classification of user behavior into five categories. A new
dataset was constructed from Reddit posts, identifying opioid user behaviors
across five classes: Dealers, Active Opioid Users, Recovered Users,
Prescription Users, and Non-Users, supported by detailed annotation guidelines.
Experiments were conducted using supervised learning. Results show that SABIA
achieved benchmark performance, outperforming the baseline (Logistic
Regression, LR = 0.86) and improving accuracy by 9.30%. Comparisons with seven
previous studies confirmed its effectiveness and robustness. This study
demonstrates the potential of hybrid deep learning models for detecting complex
opioid-related behaviors on social media, supporting public health monitoring
and intervention efforts.

Abstract: Fine-tuning foundation models is critical for superior performance on

Conclusion: AnalogSeeker为模拟电路设计提供了有效的开源解决方案，性能优于原模型且与商业模型竞争。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose AnalogSeeker, an effort toward an open-source
foundation language model for analog circuit design, with the aim of
integrating domain knowledge and giving design assistance. To overcome the
scarcity of data in this field, we employ a corpus collection strategy based on
the domain knowledge framework of analog circuits. High-quality, accessible
textbooks across relevant subfields are systematically curated and cleaned into
a textual domain corpus. To address the complexity of knowledge of analog
circuits, we introduce a granular domain knowledge distillation method. Raw,
unlabeled domain corpus is decomposed into typical, granular learning nodes,
where a multi-agent framework distills implicit knowledge embedded in
unstructured text into question-answer data pairs with detailed reasoning
processes, yielding a fine-grained, learnable dataset for fine-tuning. To
address the unexplored challenges in training analog circuit foundation models,
we explore and share our training methods through both theoretical analysis and
experimental validation. We finally establish a fine-tuning-centric training
paradigm, customizing and implementing a neighborhood self-constrained
supervised fine-tuning algorithm. This approach enhances training outcomes by
constraining the perturbation magnitude between the model's output
distributions before and after training. In practice, we train the
Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct model to obtain AnalogSeeker, which achieves 85.04%
accuracy on AMSBench-TQA, the analog circuit knowledge evaluation benchmark,
with a 15.67% point improvement over the original model and is competitive with
mainstream commercial models. Furthermore, AnalogSeeker also shows
effectiveness in the downstream operational amplifier design task. AnalogSeeker
is open-sourced at https://huggingface.co/analogllm/analogseeker for research

Abstract: We study parameterized approximability of three optimization problems related
to stable matching: (1) Min-BP-SMI: Given a stable marriage instance and a
number k, find a size-at-least-k matching that minimizes the number $\beta$ of
blocking pairs; (2) Min-BP-SRI: Given a stable roommates instance, find a
matching that minimizes the number $\beta$ of blocking pairs; (3) Max-SMTI:
Given a stable marriage instance with preferences containing ties, find a
maximum-size stable matching.
  The first two problems are known to be NP-hard to approximate to any constant
factor and W[1]-hard with respect to $\beta$, making the existence of an EPTAS
or FPT-algorithms unlikely. We show that they are W[1]-hard with respect to
$\beta$ to approximate to any function of $\beta$. This means that unless
FPT=W[1], there is no FPT-approximation scheme for the parameter $\beta$. The
last problem (Max-SMTI) is known to be NP-hard to approximate to factor-29/33
and W[1]-hard with respect to the number of ties. We complement this and
present an FPT-approximation scheme for the parameter "number of agents with
ties".

*Greg Sadler,Nathan Sherburn*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 论文提出“法律零日漏洞”概念，指法律框架中未发现的漏洞，可能被利用导致社会混乱。通过案例和方法论分析，探讨AI系统发现此类漏洞的潜力与风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是揭示法律框架中未被发现的漏洞，这些漏洞可能被AI系统利用，导致社会混乱，从而需要提前识别和防范。

Method: 提出风险模型识别法律漏洞，并以2017年澳大利亚双重国籍危机为例，开发“法律谜题”方法评估AI系统发现漏洞的能力。

Result: 研究发现当前AI模型可能无法可靠发现重大法律漏洞，但未来系统可能具备此能力，带来风险与改进法律稳健性的机会。

Conclusion: 研究为识别和缓解前沿AI系统的潜在风险提供了新视角，强调需提升法律框架的稳健性。

Abstract: We introduce the concept of "Legal Zero-Days" as a novel risk vector for
advanced AI systems. Legal Zero-Days are previously undiscovered
vulnerabilities in legal frameworks that, when exploited, can cause immediate
and significant societal disruption without requiring litigation or other
processes before impact. We present a risk model for identifying and evaluating
these vulnerabilities, demonstrating their potential to bypass safeguards or
impede government responses to AI incidents. Using the 2017 Australian dual
citizenship crisis as a case study, we illustrate how seemingly minor legal
oversights can lead to large-scale governance disruption. We develop a
methodology for creating "legal puzzles" as evaluation instruments for
assessing AI systems' capabilities to discover such vulnerabilities. Our
findings suggest that while current AI models may not reliably find impactful
Legal Zero-Days, future systems may develop this capability, presenting both
risks and opportunities for improving legal robustness. This work contributes
to the broader effort to identify and mitigate previously unrecognized risks
from frontier AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注算法偏见，但对NLP从业者在数据公平性中的角色了解不足。

Method: 通过2024年的问卷和焦点小组，分析美国NLP从业者对公平性的理解及治理挑战。

Result: 发现商业目标与公平承诺的冲突，呼吁更具参与性和问责性的数据流程。

Conclusion: 改善NLP公平性需结构性治理改革，支持从业者能动性和社区共识。

Abstract: While research has focused on surfacing and auditing algorithmic bias to
ensure equitable AI development, less is known about how NLP practitioners -
those directly involved in dataset development, annotation, and deployment -
perceive and navigate issues of NLP data equity. This study is among the first
to center practitioners' perspectives, linking their experiences to a
multi-scalar AI governance framework and advancing participatory
recommendations that bridge technical, policy, and community domains. Drawing
on a 2024 questionnaire and focus group, we examine how U.S.-based NLP data
practitioners conceptualize fairness, contend with organizational and systemic
constraints, and engage emerging governance efforts such as the U.S. AI Bill of
Rights. Findings reveal persistent tensions between commercial objectives and
equity commitments, alongside calls for more participatory and accountable data
workflows. We critically engage debates on data diversity and diversity
washing, arguing that improving NLP equity requires structural governance
reforms that support practitioner agency and community consent.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种概率延迟分析（PLA）方法，用于建模ROS 2 DDS通信的可靠传输过程，解决了无线网络中参数调优的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ROS 2 DDS在无线网络中因心跳周期、IP分片和重传间隔的紧密耦合导致延迟行为不明确，缺乏调优指导。

Method: 采用离散状态方法，系统分析中间件和传输层事件，计算未确认消息的稳态概率分布和重传延迟。

Result: 通过270种场景验证，PLA预测与实验结果高度吻合。

Conclusion: PLA为无线工业机器人中可靠性、延迟和性能的系统优化提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) is now the de facto standard for robotic
communication, pairing UDP transport with the Data Distribution Service (DDS)
publish-subscribe middleware. DDS achieves reliability through periodic
heartbeats that solicit acknowledgments for missing samples and trigger
selective retransmissions. In lossy wireless networks, the tight coupling among
heartbeat period, IP fragmentation, and retransmission interval obscures end to
end latency behavior and leaves practitioners with little guidance on how to
tune these parameters. To address these challenges, we propose a probabilistic
latency analysis (PLA) that analytically models the reliable transmission
process of ROS 2 DDS communication using a discrete state approach. By
systematically analyzing both middleware level and transport level events, PLA
computes the steady state probability distribution of unacknowledged messages
and the retransmission latency. We validate our PLA across 270 scenarios,
exploring variations in packet delivery ratios, message sizes, and both
publishing and retransmission intervals, demonstrating a close alignment
between analytical predictions and experimental results. Our findings establish
a theoretical basis to systematically optimize reliability, latency, and
performance in wireless industrial robotics.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Saracoder通过分层特征优化和外部符号消解，显著提升了代码补全的准确性和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于文本相似性的检索增强生成方法存在语义误导、冗余和同质化问题，且无法解决外部符号歧义。

Method: 提出Saracoder框架，包括分层特征优化模块（基于语义关系、结构相似性和多样性重排序）和外部符号消解模块。

Result: 在CrossCodeEval和RepoEval-Updated基准测试中显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 系统化多维度优化检索结果，为代码补全系统提供了新范式。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for repository-level code completion
commonly relies on superficial text similarity, leading to results plagued by
semantic misguidance, redundancy, and homogeneity, while also failing to
resolve external symbol ambiguity. To address these challenges, we introduce
Saracoder, a Hierarchical Feature-Optimized retrieval framework. Its core
Hierarchical Feature Optimization module systematically refines candidates by
distilling deep semantic relationships, pruning exact duplicates, assessing
structural similarity with a novel graph-based metric that weighs edits by
their topological importance, and reranking results to maximize both relevance
and diversity. Furthermore, an External-Aware Identifier Disambiguator module
accurately resolves cross-file symbol ambiguity via dependency analysis.
Extensive experiments on the challenging CrossCodeEval and RepoEval-Updated
benchmarks demonstrate that Saracoder significantly outperforms existing
baselines across multiple programming languages and models. Our work proves
that systematically refining retrieval results across multiple dimensions
provides a new paradigm for building more accurate and robust repository-level
code completion systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“Next Edit Prediction”的新任务，旨在通过开发者最近的交互历史预测其下一步编辑的位置和内容，以提升代码编辑体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的AI代码助手（如低延迟代码补全和基于聊天的编辑）未能主动预测开发者的一系列相关编辑，导致用户体验不佳。

Method: 研究团队构建了一个高质量的监督微调数据集和评估基准，并对一系列模型进行了监督微调与全面评估。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法能够有效预测开发者的下一步编辑，为新的交互范式奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 这项工作为一种主动协作的交互范式提供了基础，能够预测开发者行为而非仅响应显式指令。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has led to the
widespread adoption of AI-powered coding assistants integrated into a
development environment. On one hand, low-latency code completion offers
completion suggestions but is fundamentally constrained to the cursor's current
position. On the other hand, chat-based editing can perform complex
modifications, yet forces developers to stop their work, describe the intent in
natural language, which causes a context-switch away from the code. This
creates a suboptimal user experience, as neither paradigm proactively predicts
the developer's next edit in a sequence of related edits. To bridge this gap
and provide the seamless code edit suggestion, we introduce the task of Next
Edit Prediction, a novel task designed to infer developer intent from recent
interaction history to predict both the location and content of the subsequent
edit. Specifically, we curate a high-quality supervised fine-tuning dataset and
an evaluation benchmark for the Next Edit Prediction task. Then, we conduct
supervised fine-tuning on a series of models and performed a comprehensive
evaluation of both the fine-tuned models and other baseline models, yielding
several novel findings. This work lays the foundation for a new interaction
paradigm that proactively collaborate with developers by anticipating their
following action, rather than merely reacting to explicit instructions.

Motivation: 云检测对大气反演、气候研究和天气预报至关重要，需要一种高效且自动化的分类方法。

Method: 采用支持向量机（SVM）结合主成分分析（PCA）降维和云敏感通道选择，对红外辐射数据进行分类。

Result: 最佳配置下分类准确率达88.30%，与MODIS云掩膜结果一致，极地区域差异较大。

Conclusion: CISVM是一种稳健、灵活且高效的云分类方法，适用于未来任务如FORUM任务。

Abstract: Cloud detection is essential for atmospheric retrievals, climate studies, and
weather forecasting. We analyze infrared radiances from the Infrared
Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) onboard Meteorological Operational
(MetOp) satellites to classify scenes as clear or cloudy.
  We apply the Support Vector Machine (SVM) approach, based on kernel methods
for non-separable data. In this study, the method is implemented for Cloud
Identification (CISVM) to classify the test set using radiances or brightness
temperatures, with dimensionality reduction through Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) and cloud-sensitive channel selection to focus on the most
informative features. Our best configuration achieves 88.30 percent agreement
with reference labels and shows strong consistency with cloud masks from the
Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), with the largest
discrepancies in polar regions due to sensor differences.
  These results demonstrate that CISVM is a robust, flexible, and efficient
method for automated cloud classification from infrared radiances, suitable for
operational retrievals and future missions such as Far infrared Outgoing
Radiation Understanding and Monitoring (FORUM), the ninth European Space Agency
Earth Explorer Mission.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了机器学习（ML）算法是否能预测任意潮汐锁定气态系外行星的3D温度和风结构，并开发了高效的ML模拟器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着望远镜技术的进步，对支持观测数据的3D气候模型需求增加，但传统GCM计算耗时，ML提供了一种快速解决方案。

Method: 使用密集神经网络（DNN）和决策树算法（XGBoost）训练60颗膨胀热木星的3D GCM网格，预测温度和风场。

Result: DNN预测的温度精度高，光谱差异小，ML模拟器能可靠预测3D温度场，适用于多种恒星类型的行星。

Conclusion: ML模拟器可作为传统GCM的快速补充工具，对气体化学和光谱影响极小。

Abstract: With the development of ever-improving telescopes capable of observing
exoplanet atmospheres in greater detail and number, there is a growing demand
for enhanced 3D climate models to support and help interpret observational data
from space missions like CHEOPS, TESS, JWST, PLATO, and Ariel. However, the
computationally intensive and time-consuming nature of general circulation
models (GCMs) poses significant challenges in simulating a wide range of
exoplanetary atmospheres. This study aims to determine whether machine learning
(ML) algorithms can be used to predict the 3D temperature and wind structure of
arbitrary tidally-locked gaseous exoplanets in a range of planetary parameters.
A new 3D GCM grid with 60 inflated hot Jupiters orbiting A, F, G, K, and M-type
host stars modelled with Exorad has been introduced. A dense neural network
(DNN) and a decision tree algorithm (XGBoost) are trained on this grid to
predict local gas temperatures along with horizontal and vertical winds. To
ensure the reliability and quality of the ML model predictions, WASP-121 b,
HATS-42 b, NGTS-17 b, WASP-23 b, and NGTS-1 b-like planets, which are all
targets for PLATO observation, are selected and modelled with ExoRad and the
two ML methods as test cases. The DNN predictions for the gas temperatures are
to such a degree that the calculated spectra agree within 32 ppm for all but
one planet, for which only one single HCN feature reaches a 100 ppm difference.
The developed ML emulators can reliably predict the complete 3D temperature
field of an inflated warm to ultra-hot tidally locked Jupiter around A to
M-type host stars. It provides a fast tool to complement and extend traditional
GCM grids for exoplanet ensemble studies. The quality of the predictions is
such that no or minimal effects on the gas phase chemistry, hence on the cloud
formation and transmission spectra, are to be expected.

Motivation: 儿童语音因音高、发音和发展特征的多样性，对年龄和性别分类提出挑战，而自监督学习模型在此领域的表现尚未充分研究。

Method: 使用PFSTAR和CMU Kids数据集，对四种Wav2Vec2变体进行分层分析，并应用PCA以减少冗余。

Result: Wav2Vec2-large-lv60在CMU Kids上达到97.14%（年龄）和98.20%（性别）准确率；在PFSTAR上，base-100h和large-lv60分别达到86.05%和95.00%。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了说话者特征在自监督学习模型中的分层结构，为儿童语音接口的优化提供了支持。

Abstract: Children's speech presents challenges for age and gender classification due
to high variability in pitch, articulation, and developmental traits. While
self-supervised learning (SSL) models perform well on adult speech tasks, their
ability to encode speaker traits in children remains underexplored. This paper
presents a detailed layer-wise analysis of four Wav2Vec2 variants using the
PFSTAR and CMU Kids datasets. Results show that early layers (1-7) capture
speaker-specific cues more effectively than deeper layers, which increasingly
focus on linguistic information. Applying PCA further improves classification,
reducing redundancy and highlighting the most informative components. The
Wav2Vec2-large-lv60 model achieves 97.14% (age) and 98.20% (gender) on CMU
Kids; base-100h and large-lv60 models reach 86.05% and 95.00% on PFSTAR. These
results reveal how speaker traits are structured across SSL model depth and
support more targeted, adaptive strategies for child-aware speech interfaces.

Conclusion: 通过优化参数需求，扩展了当前硬件上可处理的问题范围，提升了量子机器学习的实用性。

Abstract: To leverage the potential computational speedup of quantum computing (QC),
research in quantum machine learning (QML) has gained increasing prominence.
Angle encoding techniques in QML models have been shown to generate truncated
Fourier series, offering asymptotically universal function approximation
capabilities. By selecting efficient feature maps (FMs) within quantum
circuits, one can leverage the exponential growth of Fourier frequencies for
improved approximation. In multi-dimensional settings, additional input
dimensions induce further exponential scaling via mixed frequencies. In
practice, however, quantum models frequently fail at regression tasks. Through
two white-box experiments, we show that such failures can occur even when the
relevant frequencies are present, due to an insufficient number of trainable
parameters.
  In order to mitigate the double-exponential parameter growth resulting from
double-exponentially growing frequencies, we propose frequency selection and
dimensional separation as techniques to constrain the number of parameters,
thereby improving trainability. By restricting the QML model to essential
frequencies and permitting mixed frequencies only among feature dimensions with
known interdependence, we expand the set of tractable problems on current
hardware. We demonstrate the reduced parameter requirements by fitting two
white-box functions with known frequency spectrum and dimensional
interdependencies that could not be fitted with the default methods. The
reduced parameter requirements permit us to perform training on a noisy quantum
simulator and to demonstrate inference on real quantum hardware.

Abstract: Scientific progress is tightly coupled to the emergence of new research
tools. Today, machine learning (ML)-especially deep learning (DL)-has become a
transformative instrument for quantum science and technology. Owing to the
intrinsic complexity of quantum systems, DL enables efficient exploration of
large parameter spaces, extraction of patterns from experimental data, and
data-driven guidance for research directions. These capabilities already
support tasks such as refining quantum control protocols and accelerating the
discovery of materials with targeted quantum properties, making ML/DL literacy
an essential skill for the next generation of quantum scientists. At the same
time, DL's power brings risks: models can overfit noisy data, obscure causal
structure, and yield results with limited physical interpretability.
Recognizing these limitations and deploying mitigation strategies is crucial
for scientific rigor. These lecture notes provide a comprehensive,
graduate-level introduction to DL for quantum applications, combining
conceptual exposition with hands-on examples. Organized as a progressive
sequence, they aim to equip readers to decide when and how to apply DL
effectively, to understand its practical constraints, and to adapt AI methods
responsibly to problems across quantum physics, chemistry, and engineering.

Abstract: We present a native three-qubit entangling gate that exploits engineered
interactions to realize control-control-target and control-target-target
operations in a single coherent step. Unlike conventional decompositions into
multiple two-qubit gates, our hybrid optimization approach selectively
amplifies desired interactions while suppressing unwanted couplings, yielding
robust performance across the computational subspace and beyond. The new gate
can be classified as a cross-resonance gate. We show it can be utilized in
several ways, for example, in GHZ triplet state preparation, Toffoli-class
logic demonstrations with many-body interactions, and in implementing a
controlled-ZZ gate. The latter maps the parity of two data qubits directly onto
a measurement qubit, enabling faster and higher-fidelity stabilizer
measurements in surface-code quantum error correction. In all these examples,
we show that the three-qubit gate performance remains robust across Hilbert
space sizes, as confirmed by testing under increasing total excitation numbers.
This work lays the foundation for co-designing circuit architectures and
control protocols that leverage native multiqubit interactions as core elements
of next-generation superconducting quantum processors.

Result: 在五个UGC数据集上，模型性能排名前二（DIVA-VQA-L: 0.898，DIVA-VQA-B: 0.886），且运行复杂度低。

Conclusion: 该模型在性能和效率上均表现优异，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: The rapid growth of user-generated (video) content (UGC) has driven increased
demand for research on no-reference (NR) perceptual video quality assessment
(VQA). NR-VQA is a key component for large-scale video quality monitoring in
social media and streaming applications where a pristine reference is not
available. This paper proposes a novel NR-VQA model based on spatio-temporal
fragmentation driven by inter-frame variations. By leveraging these inter-frame
differences, the model progressively analyses quality-sensitive regions at
multiple levels: frames, patches, and fragmented frames. It integrates frames,
fragmented residuals, and fragmented frames aligned with residuals to
effectively capture global and local information. The model extracts both 2D
and 3D features in order to characterize these spatio-temporal variations.
Experiments conducted on five UGC datasets and against state-of-the-art models
ranked our proposed method among the top 2 in terms of average rank correlation
(DIVA-VQA-L: 0.898 and DIVA-VQA-B: 0.886). The improved performance is offered
at a low runtime complexity, with DIVA-VQA-B ranked top and DIVA-VQA-L third on

Motivation: 现有方法在大错位和可解释性方面存在不足，DINOMotion旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 结合DINOv2的强大特征表示和LoRA层减少可训练参数，通过自动检测标志点实现图像配准。

Result: 在肾脏、肝脏和肺部的实验中，Dice分数分别为92.07%、90.90%和95.23%，处理时间约30ms。

Conclusion: DINOMotion在实时运动跟踪中表现出色，尤其适用于大错位情况。

Abstract: Accurate tissue motion tracking is critical to ensure treatment outcome and
safety in 2D-Cine MRI-guided radiotherapy. This is typically achieved by
registration of sequential images, but existing methods often face challenges
with large misalignments and lack of interpretability. In this paper, we
introduce DINOMotion, a novel deep learning framework based on DINOv2 with
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) layers for robust, efficient, and interpretable
motion tracking. DINOMotion automatically detects corresponding landmarks to
derive optimal image registration, enhancing interpretability by providing
explicit visual correspondences between sequential images. The integration of
LoRA layers reduces trainable parameters, improving training efficiency, while
DINOv2's powerful feature representations offer robustness against large
misalignments. Unlike iterative optimization-based methods, DINOMotion directly
computes image registration at test time. Our experiments on volunteer and
patient datasets demonstrate its effectiveness in estimating both linear and
nonlinear transformations, achieving Dice scores of 92.07% for the kidney,
90.90% for the liver, and 95.23% for the lung, with corresponding Hausdorff
distances of 5.47 mm, 8.31 mm, and 6.72 mm, respectively. DINOMotion processes
each scan in approximately 30ms and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, particularly in handling large misalignments. These results highlight
its potential as a robust and interpretable solution for real-time motion
tracking in 2D-Cine MRI-guided radiotherapy.

IQ-OTH/NCCD dataset (1,197 scans across Normal, Benign, and Malignant classes),
we evaluate a custom convolutional neural network (CNN) and three fine-tuned
transfer learning backbones: DenseNet121, ResNet152, and VGG19. Models are
trained with cost-sensitive learning to mitigate class imbalance and evaluated
via accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. While ResNet152
achieved the highest accuracy (97.3%), DenseNet121 provided the best overall
balance in precision, recall, and F1 (up to 92%, 90%, 91%, respectively). We
further apply Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) to visualize evidence
contributing to predictions, improving clinical transparency. Results indicate
that CNN-based approaches augmented with explainability can provide fast,
accurate, and interpretable support for lung cancer screening, particularly in
resource-limited settings.

TL;DR: 该博士研究通过改进神经网络架构和半监督学习框架，解决了手术视频分析中的标注稀缺、时空复杂性和领域差异问题，并发布了两个大型数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手术视频分析在临床部署中面临标注稀缺、时空复杂性和领域差异等挑战，研究旨在开发鲁棒且通用的AI解决方案。

Method: 通过基准测试选择最优神经网络架构，提出新架构和半监督框架（如DIST、SemiVT-Surge、ENCORE），减少对标注数据的依赖。

Result: 提出的方法在手术数据集上达到先进水平，并发布了GynSurg和Cataract-1K两个大型数据集。

Conclusion: 研究为手术视频分析提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案，为AI在手术护理和培训中的应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Advances in surgical video analysis are transforming operating rooms into
intelligent, data-driven environments. Computer-assisted systems support full
surgical workflow, from preoperative planning to intraoperative guidance and
postoperative assessment. However, developing robust and generalizable models
for surgical video understanding remains challenging due to (I) annotation
scarcity, (II) spatiotemporal complexity, and (III) domain gap across
procedures and institutions. This doctoral research aims to bridge the gap
between deep learning-based surgical video analysis in research and its
real-world clinical deployment. To address the core challenge of recognizing
surgical phases, actions, and events, critical for analysis, I benchmarked
state-of-the-art neural network architectures to identify the most effective
designs for each task. I further improved performance by proposing novel
architectures and integrating advanced modules. Given the high cost of expert
annotations and the domain gap across surgical video sources, I focused on
reducing reliance on labeled data. We developed semi-supervised frameworks that
improve model performance across tasks by leveraging large amounts of unlabeled
surgical video. We introduced novel semi-supervised frameworks, including DIST,
SemiVT-Surge, and ENCORE, that achieved state-of-the-art results on challenging
surgical datasets by leveraging minimal labeled data and enhancing model
training through dynamic pseudo-labeling. To support reproducibility and
advance the field, we released two multi-task datasets: GynSurg, the largest
gynecologic laparoscopy dataset, and Cataract-1K, the largest cataract surgery
video dataset. Together, this work contributes to robust, data-efficient, and
clinically scalable solutions for surgical video analysis, laying the
foundation for generalizable AI systems that can meaningfully impact surgical
care and training.

Result: 实验验证了Haar-tSVD在去噪速度和性能上的平衡，以及细节保留能力。

Conclusion: Haar-tSVD是一种高效、适应性强的去噪方法，适用于多种实际任务。

Abstract: The advancement of imaging devices and countless image data generated
everyday impose an increasingly high demand on efficient and effective image
denoising. In this paper, we present a computationally simple denoising
algorithm, termed Haar-tSVD, aiming to explore the nonlocal self-similarity
prior and leverage the connection between principal component analysis (PCA)
and the Haar transform under circulant representation. We show that global and
local patch correlations can be effectively captured through a unified
tensor-singular value decomposition (t-SVD) projection with the Haar transform.
This results in a one-step, highly parallelizable filtering method that
eliminates the need for learning local bases to represent image patches,
striking a balance between denoising speed and performance. Furthermore, we
introduce an adaptive noise estimation scheme based on a CNN estimator and
eigenvalue analysis to enhance the robustness and adaptability of the proposed
method. Experiments on different real-world denoising tasks validate the
efficiency and effectiveness of Haar-tSVD for noise removal and detail
preservation. Datasets, code and results are publicly available at

TL;DR: 论文分析了Hopfield网络中记忆形成和遗忘的机制，揭示了分岔现象如何影响吸引子和其边界的形成与消失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管人工神经网络（ANNs）发展迅速，但其学习过程中的记忆形成和缺陷（如虚假记忆和灾难性遗忘）仍不明确。本文旨在通过分析Hopfield网络，揭示这些机制。

Method: 通过研究81神经元Hopfield网络在Hebbian学习下的分岔现象，分析了吸引子及其边界的形成与破坏过程。

Result: 研究表明，刺激通过影响权重演化，引发分岔现象，形成新的吸引子（代表真实或虚假记忆）并导致旧记忆的突然消失（灾难性遗忘）。

Conclusion: 记忆形成和遗忘是同一机制的表现。该分析方法适用于任何形式的循环神经网络，有助于理解其运作并改进缺陷。

Abstract: Despite explosive expansion of artificial intelligence based on artificial
neural networks (ANNs), these are employed as "black boxes'', as it is unclear
how, during learning, they form memories or develop unwanted features,
including spurious memories and catastrophic forgetting. Much research is
available on isolated aspects of learning ANNs, but due to their high
dimensionality and non-linearity, their comprehensive analysis remains a
challenge. In ANNs, knowledge is thought to reside in connection weights or in
attractor basins, but these two paradigms are not linked explicitly. Here we
comprehensively analyse mechanisms of memory formation in an 81-neuron Hopfield
network undergoing Hebbian learning by revealing bifurcations leading to
formation and destruction of attractors and their basin boundaries. We show
that, by affecting evolution of connection weights, the applied stimuli induce
a pitchfork and then a cascade of saddle-node bifurcations creating new
attractors with their basins that can code true or spurious memories, and an
abrupt disappearance of old memories (catastrophic forgetting). With successful
learning, new categories are represented by the basins of newly born point
attractors, and their boundaries by the stable manifolds of new saddles. With
this, memorisation and forgetting represent two manifestations of the same
mechanism. Our strategy to analyse high-dimensional learning ANNs is universal
and applicable to recurrent ANNs of any form. The demonstrated mechanisms of
memory formation and of catastrophic forgetting shed light on the operation of
a wider class of recurrent ANNs and could aid the development of approaches to
mitigate their flaws.

Motivation: 由于缺乏经验的研究者难以理解ESN参数选择和架构调整的影响，本文旨在提供实用的配置指南，并分析不同参数和架构变化对性能的影响。

Method: 通过四种基准任务（时间序列预测、模式生成、混沌系统预测和时间序列分类）进行实验，评估ESN的性能。

Result: 实验展示了不同参数选择和架构调整对ESN性能的具体影响，为初学者提供了配置指导。

Conclusion: 本文为ESN的配置提供了实用经验法则，有助于初学者快速掌握参数选择和架构设计的关键点。

Abstract: This paper examines Echo State Network, a reservoir computer, performance
using four different benchmark problems, then proposes heuristics or rules of
thumb for configuring the architecture, as well as the selection of parameters
and their values, which are applicable to problems within the same domain, to
help serve to fill the experience gap needed by those entering this field of
study. The influence of various parameter selections and their value
adjustments, as well as architectural changes made to an Echo State Network, a
powerful recurrent neural network configured as a reservoir computer, can be
challenging to fully comprehend without experience in the field, and even some
hyperparameter optimization algorithms may have difficulty adjusting parameter
values without proper manual selections made first. Therefore, it is imperative
to understand the effects of parameters and their value selection on Echo State
Network architecture performance for a successful build. Thus, to address the
requirement for an extensive background in Echo State Network architecture, as
well as examine how Echo State Network performance is affected with respect to
variations in architecture, design, and parameter selection and values, a
series of benchmark tasks representing different problem domains, including
time series prediction, pattern generation, chaotic system prediction, and time
series classification, were modeled and experimented on to show the impact on
the performance of Echo State Network.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel model architecture for optimizing
personalized product search ranking using a multi-task learning (MTL)
framework. Our approach uniquely integrates tabular and non-tabular data,
leveraging a pre-trained TinyBERT model for semantic embeddings and a novel
sampling technique to capture diverse customer behaviors. We evaluate our model
against several baselines, including XGBoost, TabNet, FT-Transformer, DCN-V2,
and MMoE, focusing on their ability to handle mixed data types and optimize
personalized ranking. Additionally, we propose a scalable relevance labeling
mechanism based on click-through rates, click positions, and semantic
similarity, offering an alternative to traditional human-annotated labels.
Experimental results show that combining non-tabular data with advanced
embedding techniques in multi-task learning paradigm significantly enhances
model performance. Ablation studies further underscore the benefits of
incorporating relevance labels, fine-tuning TinyBERT layers, and TinyBERT
query-product embedding interactions. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach in achieving improved personalized product search
ranking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电商推荐系统通常优化CTR，但ACR和OSR更直接关联业务目标（如GMV），因此需要比较不同优化目标的效果。

Method: 通过在线A/B测试比较优化CTR与优化ACR/OSR的效果。

Result: 优化OSR的GMV提升效果是优化CTR的五倍以上，且不影响新品发现。

Conclusion: 优化OSR比CTR更能有效提升业务目标，同时揭示了不同目标下特征重要性的差异。

Abstract: Ranking product recommendations to optimize for a high click-through rate
(CTR) or for high conversion, such as add-to-cart rate (ACR) and
Order-Submit-Rate (OSR, view-to-purchase conversion) are standard practices in
e-commerce. Optimizing for CTR appears like a straightforward choice: Training
data (i.e., click data) are simple to collect and often available in large
quantities. Additionally, CTR is used far beyond e-commerce, making it a
generalist, easily implemented option. ACR and OSR, on the other hand, are more
directly linked to a shop's business goals, such as the Gross Merchandise Value
(GMV). In this paper, we compare the effects of using either of these
objectives using an online A/B test. Among our key findings, we demonstrate
that in our shops, optimizing for OSR produces a GMV uplift more than five
times larger than when optimizing for CTR, without sacrificing new product
discovery. Our results also provide insights into the different feature
importances for each of the objectives.

TL;DR: CrossDenoise是一种轻量级框架，通过分解噪声估计为用户、项目和交互特定因素，有效解决隐式反馈中的噪声问题，显著提升推荐准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐式反馈因假阳性和假阴性而噪声严重，现有去噪方法忽略实体感知建模或计算开销高，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出CrossDenoise框架，通过基于排名的线性映射计算用户和项目可靠性，并结合交互级权重，设计模型无关且高效。

Result: 在多个数据集和模型上，CrossDenoise显著优于基线方法，如Yelp上NDCG@50提升27.01%，计算开销极低。

Conclusion: CrossDenoise能有效分离噪声样本，超参数鲁棒性强，为隐式反馈去噪提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Recommender systems heavily rely on implicit feedback, which is inherently
noisy due to false positives and negatives, severely degrading recommendation
accuracy. Existing denoising strategies often overlook entity-aware modeling,
suffer from high computational overhead, or demand excessive hyperparameter
tuning, limiting their real-world applicability. We propose CrossDenoise, a
novel and lightweight framework that addresses these challenges by
disentangling noise estimation into user-, item-, and interaction-specific
factors. Leveraging empirical observations that show significant heterogeneity
in user and item noise propensities, CrossDenoise computes entity reputation
factors (user/item reliability) via a rank-based linear mapping of average
training losses. These are fused with interaction-level weights derived from an
empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) of individual losses. This
design is model-agnostic, computationally efficient, and requires only two
intuitive hyperparameters. Extensive experiments on ML-1M, Yelp, and
Amazon-book datasets, across GMF, NeuMF, and CDAE backbones, demonstrate that
CrossDenoise consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines. For instance, it achieves up to 27.01% NDCG@50 gain on Yelp with
NeuMF, while incurring negligible computational and memory overhead. Our
analysis confirms that CrossDenoise effectively separates clean from noisy
samples and remains robust under varied hyperparameter settings. It offers a
practical and scalable solution for denoising implicit feedback.

Motivation: 解决文本提示在复杂任务中精度不足的问题，同时避免传统控制方式的复杂性。

Method: 开发MCP服务器和提示设计标准，结合Claude模型生成OSC消息，并通过14个QA示例验证。

Result: MCP2OSC能有效生成、解释、验证和管理OSC消息，支持灵活精度控制。

Conclusion: 该方法为多媒体设备提供了一种基于LLM的通用控制机制，展示了MCP在网络协议层的创新应用。

Abstract: Text prompts enable intuitive content creation but may fall short in
achieving high precision for intricate tasks; knob or slider controls offer
precise adjustments at the cost of increased complexity. To address the gap
between knobs and prompts, a new MCP (Model Context Protocol) server and a
unique set of prompt design criteria are presented to enable exploring
parametric OSC (OpenSoundControl) control by natural language prompts.
Demonstrated by 14 practical QA examples with best practices and the
generalized prompt templates, this study finds Claude integrated with the
MCP2OSC server effective in generating OSC messages by natural language,
interpreting, searching, and visualizing OSC messages, validating and debugging
OSC messages, and managing OSC address patterns. MCP2OSC enhances human-machine
collaboration by leveraging LLM (Large Language Model) to handle intricate OSC
development tasks, and by empowering human creativity with an intuitive
language interface featuring flexible precision controls: a prompt-based OSC
tool. This study provides a novel perspective on the creative MCP application
at the network protocol level by utilizing LLM's strength in directly
processing and generating human-readable OSC messages. The results suggest its
potential for a LLM-based universal control mechanism for multimedia devices.

Abstract: Effective interdisciplinary communication is frequently hindered by
domain-specific jargon. To explore the jargon barriers in-depth, we conducted a
formative diary study with 16 professionals, revealing critical limitations in
current jargon-management strategies during workplace meetings. Based on these
insights, we designed ParseJargon, an interactive LLM-powered system providing
real-time personalized jargon identification and explanations tailored to
users' individual backgrounds. A controlled experiment comparing ParseJargon
against baseline (no support) and general-purpose (non-personalized) conditions
demonstrated that personalized jargon support significantly enhanced
participants' comprehension, engagement, and appreciation of colleagues' work,
whereas general-purpose support negatively affected engagement. A follow-up
field study validated ParseJargon's usability and practical value in real-time

Conclusion: 强调生理特征选择中严格可重复性评估的重要性，适用于安全关键领域。

Abstract: In Affective Computing, a key challenge lies in reliably linking subjective
emotional experiences with objective physiological markers. This preliminary
study addresses the issue of reproducibility by identifying physiological
features from cardiovascular and electrodermal signals that are associated with
continuous self-reports of arousal levels. Using the Continuously Annotated
Signal of Emotion dataset, we analyzed 164 features extracted from cardiac and
electrodermal signals of 30 participants exposed to short emotion-evoking
videos. Feature selection was performed using the Terminating-Random
Experiments (T-Rex) method, which performs variable selection systematically
controlling a user-defined target False Discovery Rate. Remarkably, among all
candidate features, only two electrodermal-derived features exhibited
reproducible and statistically significant associations with arousal, achieving
a 100\% confirmation rate. These results highlight the necessity of rigorous
reproducibility assessments in physiological features selection, an aspect
often overlooked in Affective Computing. Our approach is particularly promising
for applications in safety-critical environments requiring trustworthy and
reliable white box models, such as mental disorder recognition and human-robot
interaction systems.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种结合联邦学习（FL）和差分隐私（DP）的方法，用于解决医疗数据中的隐私与临床效用之间的权衡问题，并通过优化算法和数据处理技术提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗数据通常存在严重的类别不平衡和隐私问题，传统方法难以在保护隐私的同时保持临床效用。

Method: 研究采用联邦学习框架，结合SMOTETomek技术处理数据不平衡，并优化FedProx算法以适应非独立同分布数据。

Result: 优化后的方法在隐私预算（epsilon）为9.0时，仍能保持77%以上的召回率，显著优于标准FedAvg。

Conclusion: 研究为开发安全、有效的医疗诊断工具提供了实用方法，适用于真实世界的异构医疗数据。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) presents a groundbreaking approach for collaborative
health research, allowing model training on decentralized data while
safeguarding patient privacy. FL offers formal security guarantees when
combined with Differential Privacy (DP). The integration of these technologies,
however, introduces a significant trade-off between privacy and clinical
utility, a challenge further complicated by the severe class imbalance often
present in medical datasets. The research presented herein addresses these
interconnected issues through a systematic, multi-stage analysis. An FL
framework was implemented for cardiovascular risk prediction, where initial
experiments showed that standard methods struggled with imbalanced data,
resulting in a recall of zero. To overcome such a limitation, we first
integrated the hybrid Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique with Tomek
Links (SMOTETomek) at the client level, successfully developing a clinically
useful model. Subsequently, the framework was optimized for non-IID data using
a tuned FedProx algorithm. Our final results reveal a clear, non-linear
trade-off between the privacy budget (epsilon) and model recall, with the
optimized FedProx consistently out-performing standard FedAvg. An optimal
operational region was identified on the privacy-utility frontier, where strong
privacy guarantees (with epsilon 9.0) can be achieved while maintaining high
clinical utility (recall greater than 77%). Ultimately, our study provides a
practical methodological blueprint for creating effective, secure, and accurate
diagnostic tools that can be applied to real-world, heterogeneous healthcare
data.

Motivation: LLMs面临日益增长的安全和伦理风险，恶意用户通过对抗性上下文欺骗模型生成有害响应。

Method: 提出Context Filtering模型，预处理输入以过滤不可信上下文，识别用户真实意图。

Result: 模型将攻击成功率降低88%，同时保持LLMs原有性能，达到最佳安全与实用性平衡。

Conclusion: 该模型无需微调即可应用于所有LLMs，显著提升安全性且不影响性能。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant advancements in
performance, various jailbreak attacks have posed growing safety and ethical
risks. Malicious users often exploit adversarial context to deceive LLMs,
prompting them to generate responses to harmful queries. In this study, we
propose a new defense mechanism called Context Filtering model, an input
pre-processing method designed to filter out untrustworthy and unreliable
context while identifying the primary prompts containing the real user intent
to uncover concealed malicious intent. Given that enhancing the safety of LLMs
often compromises their helpfulness, potentially affecting the experience of
benign users, our method aims to improve the safety of the LLMs while
preserving their original performance. We evaluate the effectiveness of our
model in defending against jailbreak attacks through comparative analysis,
comparing our approach with state-of-the-art defense mechanisms against six
different attacks and assessing the helpfulness of LLMs under these defenses.
Our model demonstrates its ability to reduce the Attack Success Rates of
jailbreak attacks by up to 88% while maintaining the original LLMs'
performance, achieving state-of-the-art Safety and Helpfulness Product results.
Notably, our model is a plug-and-play method that can be applied to all LLMs,
including both white-box and black-box models, to enhance their safety without
requiring any fine-tuning of the models themselves. We will make our model
publicly available for research purposes.

*Yuksel Aydin*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出CCS-7分类法，揭示语言模型存在类似人类的认知漏洞，并通过实验验证了不同架构模型对这些漏洞的响应差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统行为对齐方法无法解决语言模型的认知漏洞，需建立新的认知安全框架。

Method: 通过随机对照试验（151人）验证TFVA课程的效果，并在12,180次实验中评估其对7种语言模型架构的影响。

Result: TFVA对人类认知安全提升7.9%，但对语言模型效果因架构而异：部分漏洞被完全缓解，部分漏洞错误率上升135%。

Conclusion: 认知安全需针对模型架构定制，干预措施可能因架构不同而失效或加剧问题，强调部署前需进行架构感知测试。

Abstract: Language models exhibit human-like cognitive vulnerabilities, such as
emotional framing, that escape traditional behavioral alignment. We present
CCS-7 (Cognitive Cybersecurity Suite), a taxonomy of seven vulnerabilities
grounded in human cognitive security research. To establish a human benchmark,
we ran a randomized controlled trial with 151 participants: a "Think First,
Verify Always" (TFVA) lesson improved cognitive security by +7.9% overall. We
then evaluated TFVA-style guardrails across 12,180 experiments on seven diverse
language model architectures. Results reveal architecture-dependent risk
patterns: some vulnerabilities (e.g., identity confusion) are almost fully
mitigated, while others (e.g., source interference) exhibit escalating
backfire, with error rates increasing by up to 135% in certain models. Humans,
in contrast, show consistent moderate improvement. These findings reframe
cognitive safety as a model-specific engineering problem: interventions
effective in one architecture may fail, or actively harm, another, underscoring
the need for architecture-aware cognitive safety testing before deployment.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的模型架构ERDALT，用于设计可证明鲁棒的恶意软件检测方法，并通过特定结构分解实现经验鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有静态恶意软件分析的机器学习方法虽准确率高，但易受对抗样本攻击，需功能保持的特定转换。

Method: 提出新模型架构和结构分解方法，构建框架ERDALT，支持在脆弱特征上学习经验鲁棒检测器。

Result: 验证表明，该方法在保持检测性能的同时实现了鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ERDALT框架为恶意软件检测提供了可证明和经验鲁棒性的解决方案。

Abstract: Malware analysis involves analyzing suspicious software to detect malicious
payloads. Static malware analysis, which does not require software execution,
relies increasingly on machine learning techniques to achieve scalability.
Although such techniques obtain very high detection accuracy, they can be
easily evaded with adversarial examples where a few modifications of the sample
can dupe the detector without modifying the behavior of the software. Unlike
other domains, such as computer vision, creating an adversarial example of
malware without altering its functionality requires specific transformations.
We propose a new model architecture for certifiably robust malware detection by
design. In addition, we show that every robust detector can be decomposed into
a specific structure, which can be applied to learn empirically robust malware
detectors, even on fragile features. Our framework ERDALT is based on this
structure. We compare and validate these approaches with machine-learning-based
malware detection methods, allowing for robust detection with limited reduction
of detection performance.

*Wenqiang Wang,Yan Xiao,Hao Lin,Yangshijie Zhang,Xiaochun Cao*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: CEMA是一种黑盒多任务文本对抗攻击方法，利用跨任务对抗文本的迁移性，通过少量查询实现高效攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖共享内部特征和大量查询，难以应对黑盒API、查询限制或多任务场景。

Method: 使用深度级替代模型，以即插即用方式训练，将多任务攻击转化为分类攻击。

Result: 在多种任务（分类、翻译、摘要、文本生成图像）中，仅需100次查询即可实现高成功率攻击。

Conclusion: CEMA在商业API和大模型中表现出色，展示了实际应用的广泛性和有效性。

Abstract: Current multi-task adversarial text attacks rely on abundant access to shared
internal features and numerous queries, often limited to a single task type. As
a result, these attacks are less effective against practical scenarios
involving black-box feedback APIs, limited queries, or multiple task types. To
bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{C}luster and \textbf{E}nsemble
\textbf{M}ulti-task Text Adversarial \textbf{A}ttack (\textbf{CEMA}), an
effective black-box attack that exploits the transferability of adversarial
texts across different tasks. CEMA simplifies complex multi-task scenarios by
using a \textit{deep-level substitute model} trained in a
\textit{plug-and-play} manner for text classification, enabling attacks without
mimicking the victim model. This approach requires only a few queries for
training, converting multi-task attacks into classification attacks and
allowing attacks across various tasks.
  CEMA generates multiple adversarial candidates using different text
classification methods and selects the one that most effectively attacks
substitute models.
  In experiments involving multi-task models with two, three, or six
tasks--spanning classification, translation, summarization, and text-to-image
generation--CEMA demonstrates significant attack success with as few as 100
queries. Furthermore, CEMA can target commercial APIs (e.g., Baidu and Google
Translate), large language models (e.g., ChatGPT 4o), and image-generation
models (e.g., Stable Diffusion V2), showcasing its versatility and
effectiveness in real-world applications.

Motivation: 联邦学习虽保护隐私，但易受数据投毒攻击，现有检测方法缺乏标准化或信任问题严重。

Method: 提出\Sys框架，分散全局服务器功能，引入由客户端生成并共识验证的法官模型。

Result: 实验证明\Sys能有效抵御投毒攻击，且法官模型具有可扩展性。

Conclusion: \Sys为联邦学习提供了一种高效、可扩展的投毒检测解决方案。

Abstract: Federated learning enhances traditional deep learning by enabling the joint
training of a model with the use of IoT device's private data. It ensures
privacy for clients, but is susceptible to data poisoning attacks during
training that degrade model performance and integrity. Current poisoning
detection methods in federated learning lack a standardized detection method or
take significant liberties with trust. In this paper, we present \Sys, a novel
blockchain-enabled poison detection framework in federated learning. The
framework decentralizes the role of the global server across participating
clients. We introduce a judge model used to detect data poisoning in model
updates. The judge model is produced by each client and verified to reach
consensus on a single judge model. We implement our solution to show \Sys is
robust against data poisoning attacks and the creation of our judge model is
scalable.

Motivation: 揭示LLM与自主代理在网络监控和决策系统中的安全隐患。

Result: 确认资源拒绝服务和内存中毒漏洞，导致性能下降。

Conclusion: 建议采用多层防御策略，验证MAESTRO在威胁映射和系统设计中的有效性。

Abstract: When combining Large Language Models (LLMs) with autonomous agents, used in
network monitoring and decision-making systems, this will create serious
security issues. In this research, the MAESTRO framework consisting of the
seven layers threat modeling architecture in the system was used to expose,
evaluate, and eliminate vulnerabilities of agentic AI. The prototype agent
system was constructed and implemented, using Python, LangChain, and telemetry
in WebSockets, and deployed with inference, memory, parameter tuning, and
anomaly detection modules. Two practical threat cases were confirmed as
follows: (i) resource denial of service by traffic replay denial-of-service,
and (ii) memory poisoning by tampering with the historical log file maintained
by the agent. These situations resulted in measurable levels of performance
degradation, i.e. telemetry updates were delayed, and computational loads were
increased, as a result of poor system adaptations. It was suggested to use a
multilayered defense-in-depth approach with memory isolation, validation of
planners and anomaly response systems in real-time. These findings verify that
MAESTRO is viable in operational threat mapping, prospective risk scoring, and
the basis of the resilient system design. The authors bring attention to the
importance of the enforcement of memory integrity, paying attention to the
adaptation logic monitoring, and cross-layer communication protection that
guarantee the agentic AI reliability in adversarial settings.

Motivation: 现代能源管理系统面临复杂的网络安全威胁和系统问题，需要一种综合性的解决方案。

Method: 提出多维度攻击/错误模型和生成式AI异常检测系统，结合视觉标记与规则的多模态分析框架（SoM-GI）。

Result: 在IEEE 14-Bus系统上验证了框架的有效性，能够检测数值方法无法识别的视觉异常。

Conclusion: 该框架通过结合数值分析和视觉模式识别，为EMS提供了全面的安全保护。

Abstract: This paper elaborates on an extensive security framework specifically
designed for energy management systems (EMSs), which effectively tackles the
dynamic environment of cybersecurity vulnerabilities and/or system problems
(SPs), accomplished through the incorporation of novel methodologies. A
comprehensive multi-point attack/error model is initially proposed to
systematically identify vulnerabilities throughout the entire EMS data
processing pipeline, including post state estimation (SE) stealth attacks, EMS
database manipulation, and human-machine interface (HMI) display corruption
according to the real-time database (RTDB) storage. This framework acknowledges
the interconnected nature of modern attack vectors, which utilize various
phases of supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data flow. Then,
generative AI (GenAI)-based anomaly detection systems (ADSs) for EMSs are
proposed for the first time in the power system domain to handle the scenarios.
Further, a set-of-mark generative intelligence (SoM-GI) framework, which
leverages multimodal analysis by integrating visual markers with rules
considering the GenAI capabilities, is suggested to overcome inherent spatial
reasoning limitations. The SoM-GI methodology employs systematic visual
indicators to enable accurate interpretation of segmented HMI displays and
detect visual anomalies that numerical methods fail to identify. Validation on
the IEEE 14-Bus system shows the framework's effectiveness across scenarios,
while visual analysis identifies inconsistencies. This integrated approach
combines numerical analysis with visual pattern recognition and linguistic
rules to protect against cyber threats and system errors.

Abstract: In this paper, we present NetMoniAI, an agentic AI framework for automatic

lightweight centralized coordination. The framework consists of two layers:
autonomous micro-agents at each node perform local traffic analysis and anomaly
detection. A central controller then aggregates insights across nodes to detect
coordinated attacks and maintain system-wide situational awareness. We
evaluated NetMoniAI on a local micro-testbed and through NS-3 simulations.
Results confirm that the two-tier agentic-AI design scales under resource
constraints, reduces redundancy, and improves response time without
compromising accuracy. To facilitate broader adoption and reproducibility, the
complete framework is available as open source. This enables researchers and
practitioners to replicate, validate, and extend it across diverse network

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于搜索的框架，通过模拟隐私关键代理交互来发现和改进攻击与防御策略，揭示了从简单请求到复杂多轮战术的攻击升级，以及从规则约束到身份验证状态机的防御进步。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理的广泛部署可能带来隐私威胁，恶意代理通过多轮交互提取敏感信息，动态对话的适应性攻击策略难以手动预测和发现。

Method: 采用搜索框架，模拟隐私关键代理交互，通过并行搜索和跨线程传播优化攻击与防御指令，利用LLM分析模拟轨迹。

Result: 攻击策略从直接请求升级为复杂多轮战术（如冒充和伪造同意），防御从规则约束发展为身份验证状态机。

Conclusion: 发现的攻击与防御策略具有跨场景和模型的实用性，为构建隐私感知代理提供了实用工具。

Abstract: The widespread deployment of LLM-based agents is likely to introduce a
critical privacy threat: malicious agents that proactively engage others in
multi-turn interactions to extract sensitive information. These dynamic
dialogues enable adaptive attack strategies that can cause severe privacy
violations, yet their evolving nature makes it difficult to anticipate and
discover sophisticated vulnerabilities manually. To tackle this problem, we
present a search-based framework that alternates between improving attacker and
defender instructions by simulating privacy-critical agent interactions. Each
simulation involves three roles: data subject, data sender, and data recipient.
While the data subject's behavior is fixed, the attacker (data recipient)
attempts to extract sensitive information from the defender (data sender)
through persistent and interactive exchanges. To explore this interaction space
efficiently, our search algorithm employs LLMs as optimizers, using parallel
search with multiple threads and cross-thread propagation to analyze simulation
trajectories and iteratively propose new instructions. Through this process, we
find that attack strategies escalate from simple direct requests to
sophisticated multi-turn tactics such as impersonation and consent forgery,
while defenses advance from rule-based constraints to identity-verification
state machines. The discovered attacks and defenses transfer across diverse
scenarios and backbone models, demonstrating strong practical utility for
building privacy-aware agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能电网中的HANs由于安全控制较弱，成为攻击者操纵需求模式的入口，威胁电网完整性。需要一种高效方法检测和分类此类攻击。

Method: 使用轻量级ANN进行实时检测，提取能耗、成本和时间特征；采用双向LSTM分类攻击类型（正常、梯形、S型）。生成合成时间序列数据模拟家庭行为。

Result: 实验表明，模型能有效识别和分类FDIAs，为边缘电网提供可扩展的解决方案。

Conclusion: 该框架为智能电网构建了数据驱动的防御机制，增强了从住宅端点的网络安全。

Abstract: False Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs) pose a significant threat to smart grid
infrastructures, particularly Home Area Networks (HANs), where real-time
monitoring and control are highly adopted. Owing to the comparatively less
stringent security controls and widespread availability of HANs, attackers view
them as an attractive entry point to manipulate aggregated demand patterns,
which can ultimately propagate and disrupt broader grid operations. These
attacks undermine the integrity of smart meter data, enabling malicious actors
to manipulate consumption values without activating conventional alarms,
thereby creating serious vulnerabilities across both residential and
utility-scale infrastructures. This paper presents a machine learning-based
framework for both the detection and classification of FDIAs using residential
energy data. A real-time detection is provided by the lightweight Artificial
Neural Network (ANN), which works by using the most vital features of energy
consumption, cost, and time context. For the classification of different attack
types, a Bidirectional LSTM is trained to recognize normal, trapezoidal, and
sigmoid attack shapes through learning sequential dependencies in the data. A
synthetic time-series dataset was generated to emulate realistic household
behaviour. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed models are
effective in identifying and classifying FDIAs, offering a scalable solution
for enhancing grid resilience at the edge. This work contributes toward
building intelligent, data-driven defence mechanisms that strengthen smart grid
cybersecurity from residential endpoints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着‘被遗忘权’需求的增加，机器遗忘成为提升信任和合规性的重要工具，但现有方法主要依赖模型权重调整，缺乏数据级优化的探索。

Method: 提出Water4MU框架，结合数字水印和双层优化（BLO），上层优化水印网络以降低遗忘难度，下层独立训练模型。

Result: 实验证明Water4MU在图像分类和生成任务中均有效，尤其在‘挑战性遗忘’场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: Water4MU通过数据级水印优化，显著提升了机器遗忘的效果，为敏感数据移除提供了新思路。

Abstract: With the increasing demand for the right to be forgotten, machine unlearning
(MU) has emerged as a vital tool for enhancing trust and regulatory compliance
by enabling the removal of sensitive data influences from machine learning (ML)
models. However, most MU algorithms primarily rely on in-training methods to
adjust model weights, with limited exploration of the benefits that data-level
adjustments could bring to the unlearning process. To address this gap, we
propose a novel approach that leverages digital watermarking to facilitate MU
by strategically modifying data content. By integrating watermarking, we
establish a controlled unlearning mechanism that enables precise removal of
specified data while maintaining model utility for unrelated tasks. We first
examine the impact of watermarked data on MU, finding that MU effectively
generalizes to watermarked data. Building on this, we introduce an
unlearning-friendly watermarking framework, termed Water4MU, to enhance
unlearning effectiveness. The core of Water4MU is a bi-level optimization (BLO)
framework: at the upper level, the watermarking network is optimized to
minimize unlearning difficulty, while at the lower level, the model itself is
trained independently of watermarking. Experimental results demonstrate that
Water4MU is effective in MU across both image classification and image
generation tasks. Notably, it outperforms existing methods in challenging MU
scenarios, known as "challenging forgets".

Conclusion: LLM驱动的CTI融合在推进自主安全操作和建立智能自适应网络安全框架方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Effective incident response (IR) is critical for mitigating cyber threats,
yet security teams are overwhelmed by alert fatigue, high false-positive rates,
and the vast volume of unstructured Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) documents.
While CTI holds immense potential for enriching security operations, its
extensive and fragmented nature makes manual analysis time-consuming and
resource-intensive. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based framework that leverages Large
Language Models (LLMs) to automate and enhance IR by integrating dynamically
retrieved CTI. Our approach introduces a hybrid retrieval mechanism that
combines NLP-based similarity searches within a CTI vector database with
standardized queries to external CTI platforms, facilitating context-aware
enrichment of security alerts. The augmented intelligence is then leveraged by
an LLM-powered response generation module, which formulates precise,
actionable, and contextually relevant incident mitigation strategies. We
propose a dual evaluation paradigm, wherein automated assessment using an
auxiliary LLM is systematically cross-validated by cybersecurity experts.
Empirical validation on real-world and simulated alerts demonstrates that our
approach enhances the accuracy, contextualization, and efficiency of IR,
alleviating analyst workload and reducing response latency. This work
underscores the potential of LLM-driven CTI fusion in advancing autonomous
security operations and establishing a foundation for intelligent, adaptive
cybersecurity frameworks.

Result: CATNet预测性能显著优于随机森林基准，网络特征对准确性有显著提升。

Conclusion: 网络连接性是价格的关键因素，图为风险评估提供了新范式，兼具高准确性和市场洞察力。

Abstract: Traditional models for pricing catastrophe (CAT) bonds struggle to capture
the complex, relational data inherent in these instruments. This paper
introduces CATNet, a novel framework that applies a geometric deep learning
architecture, the Relational Graph Convolutional Network (R-GCN), to model the
CAT bond primary market as a graph, leveraging its underlying network structure
for spread prediction. Our analysis reveals that the CAT bond market exhibits
the characteristics of a scale-free network, a structure dominated by a few
highly connected and influential hubs. CATNet demonstrates high predictive
performance, significantly outperforming a strong Random Forest benchmark. The
inclusion of topological centrality measures as features provides a further,
significant boost in accuracy. Interpretability analysis confirms that these
network features are not mere statistical artifacts; they are quantitative
proxies for long-held industry intuition regarding issuer reputation,
underwriter influence, and peril concentration. This research provides evidence
that network connectivity is a key determinant of price, offering a new
paradigm for risk assessment and proving that graph-based models can deliver
both state-of-the-art accuracy and deeper, quantifiable market insights.

Method: 比较人类与八种LLMs在抽象模式完成任务中的表现和神经表征（EEG记录的FRPs），分析模型参数、任务表现及神经表征的关联。

Result: 最大LLMs（如Qwen-2.5-72B和DeepSeek-R1-70B）表现接近人类，中间层能区分模式类别，且其表征几何与人类额叶FRPs中度相关。

Conclusion: LLMs可能模拟人类抽象推理的神经机制，初步支持生物与人工智能的共享原则。

Abstract: This study investigates whether large language models (LLMs) mirror human
neurocognition during abstract reasoning. We compared the performance and
neural representations of human participants with those of eight open-source
LLMs on an abstract-pattern-completion task. We leveraged pattern type
differences in task performance and in fixation-related potentials (FRPs) as
recorded by electroencephalography (EEG) during the task. Our findings indicate
that only the largest tested LLMs (~70 billion parameters) achieve
human-comparable accuracy, with Qwen-2.5-72B and DeepSeek-R1-70B also showing
similarities with the human pattern-specific difficulty profile. Critically,
every LLM tested forms representations that distinctly cluster the abstract
pattern categories within their intermediate layers, although the strength of
this clustering scales with their performance on the task. Moderate positive
correlations were observed between the representational geometries of
task-optimal LLM layers and human frontal FRPs. These results consistently
diverged from comparisons with other EEG measures (response-locked ERPs and
resting EEG), suggesting a potential shared representational space for abstract
patterns. This indicates that LLMs might mirror human brain mechanisms in
abstract reasoning, offering preliminary evidence of shared principles between
biological and artificial intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统观点中神经网络计算能力仅由静态结构决定的局限性，并解释为何脑启发的脉冲神经网络（SNNs）表现不佳的长期悖论。

Method: 通过将静态输入编码为可控的动态轨迹，揭示了由相空间体积动力学驱动的双模优化景观，包括‘耗散’和‘扩展’两种计算模式。

Result: 研究发现，动态对齐原则使SNNs在分类、强化学习和认知整合等任务中表现优于或匹敌传统人工神经网络，同时揭示了计算优势源于输入动态与神经元整合的时间尺度对齐。

Conclusion: 论文表明，计算能力可通过‘软件’动态塑造固定‘硬件’，为AI研究提供了从设计复杂静态架构转向掌握自适应动态计算原则的新方向。

Abstract: The computational capabilities of a neural network are widely assumed to be
determined by its static architecture. Here we challenge this view by
establishing that a fixed neural structure can operate in fundamentally
different computational modes, driven not by its structure but by the temporal
dynamics of its input signals. We term this principle 'Dynamical Alignment'.
  Applying this principle offers a novel resolution to the long-standing
paradox of why brain-inspired spiking neural networks (SNNs) underperform. By
encoding static input into controllable dynamical trajectories, we uncover a
bimodal optimization landscape with a critical phase transition governed by
phase space volume dynamics. A 'dissipative' mode, driven by contracting
dynamics, achieves superior energy efficiency through sparse temporal codes. In
contrast, an 'expansive' mode, driven by expanding dynamics, unlocks the
representational power required for SNNs to match or even exceed their
artificial neural network counterparts on diverse tasks, including
classification, reinforcement learning, and cognitive integration.
  We find this computational advantage emerges from a timescale alignment
between input dynamics and neuronal integration. This principle, in turn,
offers a unified, computable perspective on long-observed dualities in
neuroscience, from stability-plasticity dilemma to segregation-integration
dynamic. It demonstrates that computation in both biological and artificial
systems can be dynamically sculpted by 'software' on fixed 'hardware', pointing
toward a potential paradigm shift for AI research: away from designing complex
static architectures and toward mastering adaptive, dynamic computation
principles.

Abstract: The Algonauts 2025 Challenge just wrapped up a few weeks ago. It is a
biennial challenge in computational neuroscience in which teams attempt to
build models that predict human brain activity from carefully curated stimuli.
Previous editions (2019, 2021, 2023) focused on still images and short videos;
the 2025 edition, which concluded last month (late July), pushed the field
further by using long, multimodal movies. Teams were tasked with predicting
fMRI responses across 1,000 whole-brain parcels across four participants in the
dataset who were scanned while watching nearly 80 hours of naturalistic movie
stimuli. These recordings came from the CNeuroMod project and included 65 hours
of training data, about 55 hours of Friends (seasons 1-6) plus four feature
films (The Bourne Supremacy, Hidden Figures, Life, and The Wolf of Wall
Street). The remaining data were used for validation: Season 7 of Friends for
in-distribution tests, and the final winners for the Challenge were those who
could best predict brain activity for six films in their held-out
out-of-distribution (OOD) set. The winners were just announced and the top team
reports are now publicly available. As members of the MedARC team which placed
4th in the competition, we reflect on the approaches that worked, what they
reveal about the current state of brain encoding, and what might come next.

TL;DR: zERExtractor是一个自动化平台，用于从科学文献中提取酶催化反应和活性数据，结合深度学习和LLM技术，填补酶动力学数据空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 酶动力学文献的快速增长超过了数据库的整理能力，阻碍了AI驱动的建模和知识发现。

Method: 采用模块化架构，结合深度学习、OCR、语义实体识别和LLM模块，通过主动学习和专家验证提取数据。

Result: 在表格识别、分子图像解释和关系提取方面表现优异，准确率高达99.1%。

Conclusion: zERExtractor为未来的AI驱动酶建模和生化知识发现奠定了基础。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of enzyme kinetics literature has outpaced the curation
capabilities of major biochemical databases, creating a substantial barrier to
AI-driven modeling and knowledge discovery. We present zERExtractor, an
automated and extensible platform for comprehensive extraction of
enzyme-catalyzed reaction and activity data from scientific literature.
zERExtractor features a unified, modular architecture that supports
plug-and-play integration of state-of-the-art models, including large language
models (LLMs), as interchangeable components, enabling continuous system
evolution alongside advances in AI. Our pipeline combines domain-adapted deep
learning, advanced OCR, semantic entity recognition, and prompt-driven LLM
modules, together with human expert corrections, to extract kinetic parameters
(e.g., kcat, Km), enzyme sequences, substrate SMILES, experimental conditions,
and molecular diagrams from heterogeneous document formats. Through active
learning strategies integrating AI-assisted annotation, expert validation, and
iterative refinement, the system adapts rapidly to new data sources. We also
release a large benchmark dataset comprising over 1,000 annotated tables and
5,000 biological fields from 270 P450-related enzymology publications.
Benchmarking demonstrates that zERExtractor consistently outperforms existing
baselines in table recognition (Acc 89.9%), molecular image interpretation (up
to 99.1%), and relation extraction (accuracy 94.2%). zERExtractor bridges the
longstanding data gap in enzyme kinetics with a flexible, plugin-ready
framework and high-fidelity extraction, laying the groundwork for future
AI-powered enzyme modeling and biochemical knowledge discovery.

*Qihua Pan,Dong Xu,Jenna Xinyi Yao,Lijia Ma,Zexuan Zhu,Junkai Ji*

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: FROGENT是一个基于大型语言模型的药物设计代理，整合了多个动态生物化学数据库、工具库和任务特定AI模型，显著提升了药物发现效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前药物发现工具分散且接口不兼容，导致科学家需要管理繁琐的脚本和重复流程。

Method: FROGENT利用大型语言模型和模型上下文协议，动态整合资源并执行复杂药物发现任务。

Result: 在八个基准测试中，FROGENT在命中发现和相互作用分析中表现显著优于基线模型和商业模型GPT-4o。

Conclusion: FROGENT通过整合和自动化药物发现流程，显著提升了研究效率。

Abstract: Powerful AI tools for drug discovery reside in isolated web apps, desktop
programs, and code libraries. Such fragmentation forces scientists to manage
incompatible interfaces and specialized scripts, which can be a cumbersome and
repetitive process. To address this issue, a Full-pROcess druG dEsign ageNT,
named FROGENT, has been proposed. Specifically, FROGENT utilizes a Large
Language Model and the Model Context Protocol to integrate multiple dynamic
biochemical databases, extensible tool libraries, and task-specific AI models.
This agentic framework allows FROGENT to execute complicated drug discovery
workflows dynamically, including component tasks such as target identification,
molecule generation and retrosynthetic planning. FROGENT has been evaluated on
eight benchmarks that cover various aspects of drug discovery, such as
knowledge retrieval, property prediction, virtual screening, mechanistic
analysis, molecular design, and synthesis. It was compared against six
increasingly advanced ReAct-style agents that support code execution and
literature searches. Empirical results demonstrated that FROGENT triples the
best baseline performance in hit-finding and doubles it in interaction
profiling, significantly outperforming both the open-source model Qwen3-32B and
the commercial model GPT-4o. In addition, real-world cases have been utilized
to validate the practicability and generalization of FROGENT. This development
suggests that streamlining the agentic drug discovery pipeline can
significantly enhance researcher productivity.

### [382] [Prediction-Powered Inference with Inverse Probability Weighting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10149)
*Jyotishka Datta,Nicholas G. Polson*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: PPI框架通过结合模型预测和偏差校正处理部分标记数据，本文扩展其处理信息性标记的能力，使用IPW方法调整偏差校正项，保持统计有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决PPI框架在标记概率变化时的统计有效性问题，结合经典调查抽样方法。

Method: 用IPW方法（Horvitz-Thompson或Hájek形式）替换PPI的无权重偏差校正项，处理标记概率变化。

Result: 模拟显示IPW调整的PPI在标记概率未知但模型正确时，性能接近已知概率情况，保持覆盖率和方差减少优势。

Conclusion: IPW调整的PPI扩展了框架的适用性，适用于标记概率变化的场景，保持统计有效性。

Abstract: Prediction-powered inference (PPI) is a recent framework for valid
statistical inference with partially labeled data, combining model-based
predictions on a large unlabeled set with bias correction from a smaller
labeled subset. We show that PPI can be extended to handle informative labeling
by replacing its unweighted bias-correction term with an inverse probability
weighted (IPW) version, using the classical Horvitz--Thompson or H\'ajek forms.
This connection unites design-based survey sampling ideas with modern
prediction-assisted inference, yielding estimators that remain valid when
labeling probabilities vary across units. We consider the common setting where
the inclusion probabilities are not known but estimated from a correctly
specified model. In simulations, the performance of IPW-adjusted PPI with
estimated propensities closely matches the known-probability case, retaining
both nominal coverage and the variance-reduction benefits of PPI.

*Kennon Stewart*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种在线环境下的机器去学习方法，通过优化后悔界限和样本复杂度，实现了更高效的去学习过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代机器学习流水线需要持续学习和去学习，但现有方法假设静态环境，无法满足实际需求。

Method: 将批量去学习场景扩展到在线设置，使用后悔、样本复杂度和删除容量等概念，并采用在线L-BFGS优化替代昂贵的Hessian逆运算。

Result: 首次实现了对数后悔界限（O(ln T)），并减少了内存占用，延长了模型寿命。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了去学习效率，减少了昂贵重新训练的需求。

Abstract: Machine unlearning work assumes a static, i.i.d training environment that
doesn't truly exist. Modern ML pipelines need to learn, unlearn, and predict
continuously on production streams of data. We translate the notion of the
batch unlearning scenario to the online setting using notions of regret, sample
complexity, and deletion capacity. We further tighten regret bounds to a
logarithmic $\mathcal{O}(\ln{T})$, a first for a machine unlearning algorithm.
And we swap out an expensive Hessian inversion with online variant of L-BFGS
optimization, removing a memory footprint that scales linearly with time. Such
changes extend the lifespan of an ML model before expensive retraining, making
for a more efficient unlearning process.

### [384] [An Iterative Algorithm for Differentially Private $k$-PCA with Adaptive Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10879)
*Johanna Düngler,Amartya Sanyal*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种差分隐私随机PCA算法，能够估计任意k维子空间，解决了现有方法在样本量或噪声引入上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有差分隐私PCA方法在样本量需求或噪声引入上存在问题，尤其是对k>1的情况缺乏有效解决方案。

Method: 提出新算法，支持任意k≤d的估计，并在k=1时与DP-PCA性能一致。

Result: 算法在k=1时达到接近最优统计误差，且对k>1提供了上下界匹配的理论保证。

Conclusion: 新算法在理论和实验上均优于基线方法，解决了现有局限性。

Abstract: Given $n$ i.i.d. random matrices $A_i \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$ that share
a common expectation $\Sigma$, the objective of Differentially Private
Stochastic PCA is to identify a subspace of dimension $k$ that captures the
largest variance directions of $\Sigma$, while preserving differential privacy
(DP) of each individual $A_i$. Existing methods either (i) require the sample
size $n$ to scale super-linearly with dimension $d$, even under Gaussian
assumptions on the $A_i$, or (ii) introduce excessive noise for DP even when
the intrinsic randomness within $A_i$ is small. Liu et al. (2022a) addressed
these issues for sub-Gaussian data but only for estimating the top eigenvector
($k=1$) using their algorithm DP-PCA. We propose the first algorithm capable of
estimating the top $k$ eigenvectors for arbitrary $k \leq d$, whilst overcoming
both limitations above. For $k=1$ our algorithm matches the utility guarantees
of DP-PCA, achieving near-optimal statistical error even when $n =
\tilde{\!O}(d)$. We further provide a lower bound for general $k > 1$, matching
our upper bound up to a factor of $k$, and experimentally demonstrate the
advantages of our algorithm over comparable baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了一种对称约束多尺度物理信息神经网络（SCMS-PINN）v35，用于精确预测二维材料的电子能带结构，通过多分支架构严格保持晶体对称性，显著提升了计算效率和物理准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在计算效率和物理准确性之间难以平衡，因此需要一种新方法来解决这一挑战。

Method: 采用多分支ResNet-6架构（K-head、M-head和General head），提取31个物理特征，并通过渐进式Dirac约束调度实现分层学习。

Result: 训练损失显著降低（99.99%），预测Dirac点间隙误差仅30.3 μeV，价带和导带平均误差分别为53.9 meV和40.5 meV。

Conclusion: 该方法为二维材料的物理信息学习提供了新框架，有望加速材料发现。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of electronic band structures in two-dimensional
materials remains a fundamental challenge, with existing methods struggling to
balance computational efficiency and physical accuracy. We present the
Symmetry-Constrained Multi-Scale Physics-Informed Neural Network (SCMS-PINN)
v35, which directly learns graphene band structures while rigorously enforcing
crystallographic symmetries through a multi-head architecture. Our approach
introduces three specialized ResNet-6 pathways -- K-head for Dirac physics,
M-head for saddle points, and General head for smooth interpolation --
operating on 31 physics-informed features extracted from k-points. Progressive
Dirac constraint scheduling systematically increases the weight parameter from
5.0 to 25.0, enabling hierarchical learning from global topology to local
critical physics. Training on 10,000 k-points over 300 epochs achieves 99.99\%
reduction in training loss (34.597 to 0.003) with validation loss of 0.0085.
The model predicts Dirac point gaps within 30.3 $\mu$eV of theoretical zero and
achieves average errors of 53.9 meV (valence) and 40.5 meV (conduction) across
the Brillouin zone. All twelve C$_{6v}$ operations are enforced through
systematic averaging, guaranteeing exact symmetry preservation. This framework
establishes a foundation for extending physics-informed learning to broader
two-dimensional materials for accelerated discovery.

*Jozef Skakala*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 利用神经网络（NN）从物理-生物地球化学模型中学习可观测变量与碳池的关系，替代昂贵的再分析数据，提供不确定性信息，并展示其在未来气候情景中的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 陆架海对碳封存和碳循环至关重要，但现有观测或卫星数据稀疏且不确定，再分析数据成本高昂。

Method: 通过神经网络集合从模型自由运行模拟中学习，应用于西北欧陆架海（NWES）再分析数据，重现碳池结果并提供不确定性信息。

Result: NN集合能准确重现再分析数据的碳池输出，并提供不确定性信息，适用于未来气候情景分析。

Conclusion: 模型驱动的机器学习是昂贵再分析数据的可行替代方案，可补充缺失或不确定的观测数据。

Abstract: Shelf seas are important for carbon sequestration and carbon cycle, but
available in situ, or satellite data for carbon pools in the shelf sea
environment are often sparse, or highly uncertain. Alternative can be provided
by reanalyses, but these are often expensive to run. We propose to use an
ensemble of neural networks (NN) to learn from a coupled
physics-biogeochemistry model the relationship between the directly observable
variables and carbon pools. We demonstrate for North-West European Shelf (NWES)
sea environment, that when the NN trained on a model free run simulation is
applied to the NWES reanalysis, it is capable to reproduce the reanalysis
outputs for carbon pools. Moreover, unlike the existing NWES reanalysis, the NN
ensemble is also capable to provide uncertainty information for the pools. We
focus on explainability of the results and demonstrate potential use of the NNs
for future climate what-if scenarios. We suggest that model-informed machine
learning presents a viable alternative to expensive reanalyses and could
complement observational data, wherever they are missing and/or highly
uncertain.

Conclusion: Garcinia cowa中的黄酮类化合物及其靶点具有抗癌潜力，网络药理学和分子对接技术为揭示其机制提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Cancer is recognized as a complex group of diseases, contributing to the
highest global mortality rates, with increasing prevalence and a trend toward
affecting younger populations. It is characterized by uncontrolled
proliferation of abnormal cells, invasion of adjacent tissues, and metastasis
to distant organs. Garcinia cowa, a traditional medicinal plant widely used in
Southeast Asia, including Vietnam, is employed to treat fever, cough,
indigestion, as a laxative, and for parasitic diseases. Numerous xanthone
compounds isolated from this species exhibit a broad spectrum of biological
activities, with some showing promise as anti cancer and antimalarial agents.
Network pharmacology analysis successfully identified key bioactive compounds
Rubraxanthone, Garcinone D, Norcowanin, Cowanol, and Cowaxanthone alongside
their primary protein targets (TNF, CTNNB1, SRC, NFKB1, and MTOR), providing
critical insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying their anti-cancer
effects. The Graph Attention Network algorithm demonstrated superior predictive
performance, achieving an R2 of 0.98 and an RMSE of 0.02 after data
augmentation, highlighting its accuracy in predicting pIC50 values for xanthone
based compounds. Additionally, molecular docking revealed MTOR as a potential
target for inducing cytotoxicity in HeLa cancer cells from Garcinia cowa.

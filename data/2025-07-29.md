### [2] [Agent WARPP: Workflow Adherence via Runtime Parallel Personalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19543)
*Maria Emilia Mazzolenis,Ruirui Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: WARPP是一个无需训练、模块化的框架，通过多智能体编排和运行时个性化提升LLM在任务导向对话中的工作流遵循能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在复杂任务导向对话中处理长条件工作流和外部工具调用的困难。

Method: 结合多智能体编排和运行时个性化，动态修剪条件分支并优化工具选择。

Result: 在多个领域和复杂意图下，WARPP在参数保真度和工具准确性上优于非个性化方法和ReAct基线，同时减少令牌使用。

Conclusion: WARPP通过运行时个性化显著提升了LLM在复杂任务中的表现，且无需额外训练。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in task-oriented
dialogue (TOD) systems but often struggle with long, conditional workflows that
involve external tool calls and depend on user-specific information. We present
Workflow Adherence via Runtime Parallel Personalization, or WARPP, a
training-free, modular framework that combines multi-agent orchestration with
runtime personalization to improve workflow adherence in LLM-based systems. By
dynamically pruning conditional branches based on user attributes, the
framework reduces reasoning overhead and narrows tool selection at runtime.
WARPP deploys a parallelized architecture where a dedicated Personalizer agent
operates alongside modular, domain-specific agents to dynamically tailor
execution paths in real time. The framework is evaluated across five
representative user intents of varying complexity within three domains:
banking, flights, and healthcare. Our evaluation leverages synthetic datasets
and LLM-powered simulated users to test scenarios with conditional
dependencies. Our results demonstrate that WARPP outperforms both the
non-personalized method and the ReAct baseline, achieving increasingly larger
gains in parameter fidelity and tool accuracy as intent complexity grows, while
also reducing average token usage, without any additional training.

### [3] [Hypergames: Modeling Misaligned Perceptions and Nested Beliefs for Multi-agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19593)
*Vince Trencsenyi,Agnieszka Mensfelt,Kostas Stathis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文系统回顾了超博弈理论在动态多智能体系统中的应用，分析了44项研究，提出了智能体兼容性标准和分类框架，并指出了当前研究的局限性和未来方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统博弈论假设理性、完全信息和共同知识，而现实多智能体系统常存在不确定性、认知偏差和异构信念。超博弈理论通过建模主观感知游戏来弥补这些不足。

Method: 通过系统回顾44项研究，引入超博弈理论及其扩展（层次超博弈和HNF），提出智能体兼容性标准和分类框架。

Result: 分析揭示了层次和图模型在欺骗性推理中的主导地位，以及理论框架在实践中的简化。同时指出了HNF模型采用不足、缺乏形式化语言等问题。

Conclusion: 本文为超博弈理论在动态多智能体环境中的应用提供了新路线图，强调了增强战略建模的现实性和有效性。

Abstract: Classical game-theoretic models typically assume rational agents, complete
information, and common knowledge of payoffs - assumptions that are often
violated in real-world MAS characterized by uncertainty, misaligned
perceptions, and nested beliefs. To overcome these limitations, researchers
have proposed extensions that incorporate models of cognitive constraints,
subjective beliefs, and heterogeneous reasoning. Among these, hypergame theory
extends the classical paradigm by explicitly modeling agents' subjective
perceptions of the strategic scenario, known as perceptual games, in which
agents may hold divergent beliefs about the structure, payoffs, or available
actions. We present a systematic review of agent-compatible applications of
hypergame theory, examining how its descriptive capabilities have been adapted
to dynamic and interactive MAS contexts. We analyze 44 selected studies from
cybersecurity, robotics, social simulation, communications, and general
game-theoretic modeling. Building on a formal introduction to hypergame theory
and its two major extensions - hierarchical hypergames and HNF - we develop
agent-compatibility criteria and an agent-based classification framework to
assess integration patterns and practical applicability. Our analysis reveals
prevailing tendencies, including the prevalence of hierarchical and graph-based
models in deceptive reasoning and the simplification of extensive theoretical
frameworks in practical applications. We identify structural gaps, including
the limited adoption of HNF-based models, the lack of formal hypergame
languages, and unexplored opportunities for modeling human-agent and
agent-agent misalignment. By synthesizing trends, challenges, and open research
directions, this review provides a new roadmap for applying hypergame theory to
enhance the realism and effectiveness of strategic modeling in dynamic
multi-agent environments.

### [4] [DeltaLLM: A Training-Free Framework Exploiting Temporal Sparsity for Efficient Edge LLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19608)
*Jiawen Qi,Chang Gao,Zhaochun Ren,Qinyu Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeltaLLM是一种无需训练的框架，通过利用注意力模式的时间稀疏性，在资源受限的边缘设备上实现高效LLM推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLM在序列长度上的计算量呈二次增长，现有动态注意力修剪方法不适合边缘设备。

Method: DeltaLLM采用精度和内存感知的delta矩阵构建策略及上下文感知的混合注意力机制。

Result: 在BitNet和Llama模型上，DeltaLLM实现了高达60%的注意力稀疏性，且精度几乎无损。

Conclusion: DeltaLLM为边缘设备上的高效LLM部署提供了无需微调的解决方案。

Abstract: Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices remains challenging
due to their quadratically increasing computations with the sequence length.
Existing studies for dynamic attention pruning are designed for hardware with
massively parallel computation capabilities, such as GPUs or TPUs, and aim at
long context lengths (e.g., 64K), making them unsuitable for edge scenarios. We
present DeltaLLM, a training-free framework that exploits temporal sparsity in
attention patterns to enable efficient LLM inference across both the prefilling
and decoding stages, on resource-constrained edge devices. DeltaLLM introduces
an accuracy- and memory-aware delta matrix construction strategy that
introduces temporal sparsity, and a context-aware hybrid attention mechanism
that combines full attention in a local context window with delta approximation
outside it to increase accuracy. We evaluate our framework on the
edge-device-friendly BitNet-b1.58-2B-4T model and Llama3.2-1B-Instruct model
across diverse language tasks. The results show that on BitNet, our framework
increases the attention sparsity from 0% to 60% during the prefilling stage
with slight accuracy improvement on the WG task, and 0% to 57% across both the
prefilling and decoding stages, with even higher F1 score from 29.63 to 30.97
on SQuAD-v2 task. On the Llama model, it can also achieve up to 60% sparsity
during the prefilling stage and around 57% across both stages with negligible
accuracy drop. These results demonstrate that DeltaLLM offers a promising
solution for efficient edge deployment, requiring no fine-tuning and seamlessly
integrating with existing inference pipelines.

Abstract: Due to the remarkable capabilities and growing impact of large language
models (LLMs), they have been deeply integrated into many aspects of society.
Thus, ensuring their alignment with human values and intentions has emerged as
a critical challenge. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of
practical alignment techniques, training protocols, and empirical findings in
LLM alignment. We analyze the development of alignment methods across diverse
paradigms, characterizing the fundamental trade-offs between core alignment
objectives. Our analysis shows that while supervised fine-tuning enables basic
instruction-following, preference-based methods offer more flexibility for
aligning with nuanced human intent. We discuss state-of-the-art techniques,
including Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), Constitutional AI,
brain-inspired methods, and alignment uncertainty quantification (AUQ),
highlighting their approaches to balancing quality and efficiency. We review
existing evaluation frameworks and benchmarking datasets, emphasizing
limitations such as reward misspecification, distributional robustness, and
scalable oversight. We summarize strategies adopted by leading AI labs to
illustrate the current state of practice. We conclude by outlining open
problems in oversight, value pluralism, robustness, and continuous alignment.
This survey aims to inform both researchers and practitioners navigating the
evolving landscape of LLM alignment.

### [6] [The wall confronting large language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19703)
*Peter V. Coveney,Sauro Succi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的性能受限于其预测不确定性的提升能力，难以满足科学研究的可靠性标准。其学习机制可能导致错误累积和信息灾难，而数据规模的增加会加剧虚假相关性。避免这种退化需要更注重问题的结构性理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在提升预测可靠性方面的局限性，揭示其学习机制与准确性之间的冲突，并提出避免AI退化的方法。

Method: 分析LLMs的扩展规律及其对预测不确定性的影响，结合数据规模与虚假相关性的关系进行研究。

Result: LLMs的学习机制可能导致错误累积和信息灾难，数据规模的增加会加剧虚假相关性，使其难以满足高可靠性需求。

Conclusion: 为避免LLMs的退化路径，需更注重对问题结构性的深入理解，而非单纯依赖数据规模的扩展。

Abstract: We show that the scaling laws which determine the performance of large
language models (LLMs) severely limit their ability to improve the uncertainty
of their predictions. As a result, raising their reliability to meet the
standards of scientific inquiry is intractable by any reasonable measure. We
argue that the very mechanism which fuels much of the learning power of LLMs,
namely the ability to generate non-Gaussian output distributions from Gaussian
input ones, might well be at the roots of their propensity to produce error
pileup, ensuing information catastrophes and degenerative AI behaviour. This
tension between learning and accuracy is a likely candidate mechanism
underlying the observed low values of the scaling components. It is
substantially compounded by the deluge of spurious correlations pointed out by
Calude and Longo which rapidly increase in any data set merely as a function of
its size, regardless of its nature. The fact that a degenerative AI pathway is
a very probable feature of the LLM landscape does not mean that it must
inevitably arise in all future AI research. Its avoidance, which we also
discuss in this paper, necessitates putting a much higher premium on insight
and understanding of the structural characteristics of the problems being
investigated.

### [7] [Minding Motivation: The Effect of Intrinsic Motivation on Agent Behaviors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19725)
*Leonardo Villalobos-Arias,Grant Forbes,Jianxun Wang,David L Roberts,Arnav Jhala*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文研究了内在动机（IM）方法在强化学习（RL）中因奖励稀疏性导致的奖励黑客问题，并通过实验评估了三种IM技术对行为的影响，发现GRM方法能部分缓解此问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 游戏中的奖励稀疏性使RL代理难以学习，IM方法虽能解决此问题，但会引发奖励黑客行为，目前对其影响尚不明确。

Method: 在MiniGrid环境中比较了三种IM技术与广义奖励匹配（GRM）方法，评估其对代理行为的影响。

Result: IM显著改变了代理的行为，提高了初始奖励，但也导致奖励黑客行为；GRM在某些情况下能缓解此问题。

Conclusion: IM确实会改变RL代理的行为，而GRM是一种潜在的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Games are challenging for Reinforcement Learning~(RL) agents due to their
reward-sparsity, as rewards are only obtainable after long sequences of
deliberate actions. Intrinsic Motivation~(IM) methods -- which introduce
exploration rewards -- are an effective solution to reward-sparsity. However,
IM also causes an issue known as `reward hacking' where the agent optimizes for
the new reward at the expense of properly playing the game. The larger problem
is that reward hacking itself is largely unknown; there is no answer to
whether, and to what extent, IM rewards change the behavior of RL agents. This
study takes a first step by empirically evaluating the impact on behavior of
three IM techniques on the MiniGrid game-like environment. We compare these IM
models with Generalized Reward Matching~(GRM), a method that can be used with
any intrinsic reward function to guarantee optimality. Our results suggest that
IM causes noticeable change by increasing the initial rewards, but also
altering the way the agent plays; and that GRM mitigated reward hacking in some
scenarios.

### [8] [HypKG: Hypergraph-based Knowledge Graph Contextualization for Precision Healthcare](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19726)
*Yuzhang Xie,Xu Han,Ran Xu,Xiao Hu,Jiaying Lu,Carl Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HypKG框架通过整合电子健康记录（EHRs）和知识图谱（KGs），生成上下文知识表示，提升医疗预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗领域对知识准确性和数据互联性要求高，但传统KGs缺乏患者特定上下文信息，而EHRs能提供这些信息。

Method: 采用实体链接技术连接KGs和EHRs，利用超图模型和超图变换器学习上下文化表示。

Result: 实验证明HypKG在医疗预测任务中显著提升性能，并能优化KGs的实体和关系表示。

Conclusion: HypKG通过整合EHRs上下文，提升了KGs的实用性和医疗预测的准确性。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are important products of the semantic web, which are
widely used in various application domains. Healthcare is one of such domains
where KGs are intensively used, due to the high requirement for knowledge
accuracy and interconnected nature of healthcare data. However, KGs storing
general factual information often lack the ability to account for important
contexts of the knowledge such as the status of specific patients, which are
crucial in precision healthcare. Meanwhile, electronic health records (EHRs)
provide rich personal data, including various diagnoses and medications, which
provide natural contexts for general KGs. In this paper, we propose HypKG, a
framework that integrates patient information from EHRs into KGs to generate
contextualized knowledge representations for accurate healthcare predictions.
Using advanced entity-linking techniques, we connect relevant knowledge from
general KGs with patient information from EHRs, and then utilize a hypergraph
model to "contextualize" the knowledge with the patient information. Finally,
we employ hypergraph transformers guided by downstream prediction tasks to
jointly learn proper contextualized representations for both KGs and patients,
fully leveraging existing knowledge in KGs and patient contexts in EHRs. In
experiments using a large biomedical KG and two real-world EHR datasets, HypKG
demonstrates significant improvements in healthcare prediction tasks across
multiple evaluation metrics. Additionally, by integrating external contexts,
HypKG can learn to adjust the representations of entities and relations in KG,
potentially improving the quality and real-world utility of knowledge.

### [9] [Integrating Activity Predictions in Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19733)
*Alec Scully,Cameron Stockton,Forrest Hare*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出利用本体结构知识图谱预测未来事件，通过BFO和CCO组织数据并构建马尔可夫链模型，同时改进概率模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨本体结构知识图谱在预测未来事件中的关键作用，并改进现有概率模型的不足。

Method: 利用BFO和CCO构建知识图谱，组织数据并生成马尔可夫链模型；提出“时空实例”概念，改进概率模型。

Result: 成功将马尔可夫链概率计算整合回知识图谱，支持进一步分析和决策。

Conclusion: 本体结构知识图谱结合改进的概率模型能有效预测未来事件，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: We argue that ontology-structured knowledge graphs can play a crucial role in
generating predictions about future events. By leveraging the semantic
framework provided by Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) and Common Core Ontologies
(CCO), we demonstrate how data such as the movements of a fishing vessel can be
organized in and retrieved from a knowledge graph. These query results are then
used to create Markov chain models, allowing us to predict future states based
on the vessel's history. To fully support this process, we introduce the term
`spatiotemporal instant' to complete the necessary structural semantics.
Additionally, we critique the prevailing ontological model of probability,
which conflates probability with likelihood and relies on the problematic
concept of modal measurements: measurements of future entities. We propose an
alternative view, where probabilities are treated as being about process
profiles, which better captures the dynamics of real world phenomena. Finally,
we demonstrate how our Markov chain based probability calculations can be
seamlessly integrated back into the knowledge graph, enabling further analysis
and decision-making. Keywords: predictive analytics, ontology, Markov chains,
probability, Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), knowledge graphs, SPARQL.

*Yufan Chen,Ching Ting Leung,Bowen Yu,Jianwei Sun,Yong Huang,Linyan Li,Hao Chen,Hanyu Gao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 开发了一种基于多模态大语言模型（MLLM）的多智能体系统，用于自动提取化学信息，显著提升了复杂化学反应图形的提取性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量化学数据库是AI驱动化学研究的基础，但当前化学信息的多模态和风格多样性限制了自动提取的效率。

Method: 利用MLLM的强大推理能力，将提取任务分解为子任务，并通过多智能体协作完成。

Result: 在复杂化学反应图形的基准数据集上，F1分数达到80.8%，显著优于之前的最佳模型（35.6%）。

Conclusion: 该系统为自动化化学信息提取提供了关键进展，将推动AI驱动的化学研究。

Abstract: To fully expedite AI-powered chemical research, high-quality chemical
databases are the cornerstone. Automatic extraction of chemical information
from the literature is essential for constructing reaction databases, but it is
currently limited by the multimodality and style variability of chemical
information. In this work, we developed a multimodal large language model
(MLLM)-based multi-agent system for automatic chemical information extraction.
We used the MLLM's strong reasoning capability to understand the structure of
complex chemical graphics, decompose the extraction task into sub-tasks and
coordinate a set of specialized agents to solve them. Our system achieved an F1
score of 80.8% on a benchmark dataset of complex chemical reaction graphics
from the literature, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art model (F1 score:
35.6%) by a significant margin. Additionally, it demonstrated consistent
improvements in key sub-tasks, including molecular image recognition, reaction
image parsing, named entity recognition and text-based reaction extraction.
This work is a critical step toward automated chemical information extraction
into structured datasets, which will be a strong promoter of AI-driven chemical
research.

### [11] [Can LLMs Solve ASP Problems? Insights from a Benchmarking Study (Extended Version)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19749)
*Lin Ren,Guohui Xiao,Guilin Qi,Yishuai Geng,Haohan Xue*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ASPBench是一个全面的ASP基准测试，揭示了当前大型语言模型在ASP求解中的局限性，尤其是在答案集计算任务上表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对大型语言模型在ASP中能力的评估有限，缺乏专门设计的任务和复杂ASP程序的支持。

Method: 引入ASPBench基准，包含三个ASP特定任务：ASP蕴含、答案集验证和答案集计算，并对14个先进LLM进行评估。

Result: LLM在前两个简单任务上表现较好，但在核心的答案集计算任务上表现不佳。

Conclusion: 需要更有效地整合符号推理能力的新方法，以提升LLM在ASP求解中的表现。

Abstract: Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a powerful paradigm for non-monotonic
reasoning. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising
capabilities in logical reasoning. Despite this potential, current evaluations
of LLM capabilities in ASP are often limited. Existing works normally employ
overly simplified ASP programs, do not support negation, disjunction, or
multiple answer sets. Furthermore, there is a lack of benchmarks that introduce
tasks specifically designed for ASP solving. To bridge this gap, we introduce
ASPBench, a comprehensive ASP benchmark, including three ASP specific tasks:
ASP entailment, answer set verification, and answer set computation. Our
extensive evaluations on ASPBench reveal that while 14 state-of-the-art LLMs,
including \emph{deepseek-r1}, \emph{o4-mini}, and
\emph{gemini-2.5-flash-thinking}, perform relatively well on the first two
simpler tasks, they struggle with answer set computation, which is the core of
ASP solving. These findings offer insights into the current limitations of LLMs
in ASP solving. This highlights the need for new approaches that integrate
symbolic reasoning capabilities more effectively. The code and dataset are
available at https://github.com/HomuraT/ASPBench.

*Aran Nayebi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种可实现的修正性框架，通过五个结构分离的效用头（如顺从性、开关访问保护等）在多步、部分可观测环境中提供可证明的保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法（如Constitutional AI或RLHF/RLAIF）将所有规范合并为一个学习标量的局限性，通过结构分离确保安全性和人类利益。

Method: 使用五个独立的效用头，并通过严格的权重间隙进行词典式组合，结合理论证明在多步环境和对抗性攻击下的安全性。

Result: 证明了单轮和多步环境中的修正性，并展示了在有限时间范围内可验证的安全性。

Conclusion: 该框架将奖励黑客风险转移到评估质量上，为当前LLM助手和未来自主系统提供了清晰的实现指导。

Abstract: We introduce the first implementable framework for corrigibility, with
provable guarantees in multi-step, partially observed environments. Our
framework replaces a single opaque reward with five *structurally separate*
utility heads -- deference, switch-access preservation, truthfulness,
low-impact behavior via a belief-based extension of Attainable Utility
Preservation, and bounded task reward -- combined lexicographically by strict
weight gaps. Theorem 1 proves exact single-round corrigibility in the partially
observable off-switch game; Theorem 3 extends the guarantee to multi-step,
self-spawning agents, showing that even if each head is \emph{learned} to
mean-squared error $\varepsilon$ and the planner is $\varepsilon$-sub-optimal,
the probability of violating \emph{any} safety property is bounded while still
ensuring net human benefit. In contrast to Constitutional AI or RLHF/RLAIF,
which merge all norms into one learned scalar, our separation makes obedience
and impact-limits dominate even when incentives conflict. For open-ended
settings where adversaries can modify the agent, we prove that deciding whether
an arbitrary post-hack agent will ever violate corrigibility is undecidable by
reduction to the halting problem, then carve out a finite-horizon ``decidable
island'' where safety can be certified in randomized polynomial time and
verified with privacy-preserving, constant-round zero-knowledge proofs.
Consequently, the remaining challenge is the ordinary ML task of data coverage
and generalization: reward-hacking risk is pushed into evaluation quality
rather than hidden incentive leak-through, giving clearer implementation
guidance for today's LLM assistants and future autonomous systems.

weighted sum using predefined weights, and a multi-objective evolutionary
algorithm (MOEA)-based approach. We conduct experiments on varying network
complexities, mimicking typical real-world challenges using a customisable
simulator. The model determines production and delivery quantities across
supply chain routes to achieve near-optimal trade-offs between competing
objectives, approximating Pareto front sets. The results demonstrate that the
primary approach provides the most balanced trade-off between optimality,
diversity, and density, further enhanced with a shared experience buffer that
allows knowledge transfer among policies. In complex settings, it achieves up
to 75\% higher hypervolume than the MOEA-based method and generates solutions
that are approximately eleven times denser, signifying better robustness, than
those produced by the modified single-objective RL method. Moreover, it ensures
stable production and inventory levels while minimising demand loss.

*Haoyang Liu,Yijiang Li,Haohan Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GenoMAS是一个基于LLM的团队协作系统，结合了结构化工作流的可靠性和自主代理的适应性，用于基因表达分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基因表达分析复杂且需要专业知识，现有自动化方法在灵活性和精确性上存在不足。

Method: GenoMAS通过六个专业LLM代理和类型化消息传递协议，结合指导性规划框架，动态调整任务执行。

Result: 在GenoTEX基准测试中，数据预处理和基因识别的性能分别提升10.61%和16.85%。

Conclusion: GenoMAS在基因分析中表现出色，同时能发现生物学上合理的基因-表型关联。

Abstract: Gene expression analysis holds the key to many biomedical discoveries, yet
extracting insights from raw transcriptomic data remains formidable due to the
complexity of multiple large, semi-structured files and the need for extensive
domain expertise. Current automation approaches are often limited by either
inflexible workflows that break down in edge cases or by fully autonomous
agents that lack the necessary precision for rigorous scientific inquiry.
GenoMAS charts a different course by presenting a team of LLM-based scientists
that integrates the reliability of structured workflows with the adaptability
of autonomous agents. GenoMAS orchestrates six specialized LLM agents through
typed message-passing protocols, each contributing complementary strengths to a
shared analytic canvas. At the heart of GenoMAS lies a guided-planning
framework: programming agents unfold high-level task guidelines into Action
Units and, at each juncture, elect to advance, revise, bypass, or backtrack,
thereby maintaining logical coherence while bending gracefully to the
idiosyncrasies of genomic data.
  On the GenoTEX benchmark, GenoMAS reaches a Composite Similarity Correlation
of 89.13% for data preprocessing and an F$_1$ of 60.48% for gene
identification, surpassing the best prior art by 10.61% and 16.85%
respectively. Beyond metrics, GenoMAS surfaces biologically plausible
gene-phenotype associations corroborated by the literature, all while adjusting
for latent confounders. Code is available at https://github.com/Liu-Hy/GenoMAS.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于扩散模型的反事实提示学习框架DiCap，通过生成满足最小充分性标准的反事实提示，解决了现有方法在因果不变性和泛化能力上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示学习方法因缺乏理论支持，难以生成因果不变的提示，导致无法有效捕捉跨类别的稳健特征。

Method: DiCap利用扩散过程从因果模型的边际和条件分布中迭代采样梯度，生成反事实提示，并结合对比学习框架优化提示提取。

Result: 实验表明，DiCap在图像分类、图文检索和视觉问答等任务中表现优异，尤其在未见类别上优势显著。

Conclusion: DiCap通过理论驱动的反事实提示生成，显著提升了提示学习的因果不变性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Prompt learning has garnered attention for its efficiency over traditional
model training and fine-tuning. However, existing methods, constrained by
inadequate theoretical foundations, encounter difficulties in achieving
causally invariant prompts, ultimately falling short of capturing robust
features that generalize effectively across categories. To address these
challenges, we introduce the $\textit{\textbf{DiCap}}$ model, a theoretically
grounded $\textbf{Di}$ffusion-based $\textbf{C}$ounterf$\textbf{a}$ctual
$\textbf{p}$rompt learning framework, which leverages a diffusion process to
iteratively sample gradients from the marginal and conditional distributions of
the causal model, guiding the generation of counterfactuals that satisfy the
minimal sufficiency criterion. Grounded in rigorous theoretical derivations,
this approach guarantees the identifiability of counterfactual outcomes while
imposing strict bounds on estimation errors. We further employ a contrastive
learning framework that leverages the generated counterfactuals, thereby
enabling the refined extraction of prompts that are precisely aligned with the
causal features of the data. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that
our method performs excellently across tasks such as image classification,
image-text retrieval, and visual question answering, with particularly strong
advantages in unseen categories.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了以人为中心的人工智能（AI）本质上是技术与人类认知之间的关系，分析了AI对人类认知劳动的替代、增强或取代，并强调必须正视人类在AI中的作用以避免认知科学的扭曲。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI与人类认知的关系，揭示AI对人类认知劳动的影响，强调以人为中心的AI设计的重要性。

Method: 通过对比技术与人认知劳动的实例（如算盘与心算、闹钟与敲窗人），提出新的定义和分析框架，将社会技术关系分为替代（有害）、增强（有益）或取代（中性）三类。

Result: AI始终涉及人类认知，忽视这一点会导致认知科学的扭曲，并限制AI系统真正以人为中心的设计。

Conclusion: 为了去神秘化AI，必须正视人类在AI中的作用，避免认知科学的扭曲，实现真正以人为中心的AI工程。

Abstract: While it seems sensible that human-centred artificial intelligence (AI) means
centring "human behaviour and experience," it cannot be any other way. AI, I
argue, is usefully seen as a relationship between technology and humans where
it appears that artifacts can perform, to a greater or lesser extent, human
cognitive labour. This is evinced using examples that juxtapose technology with
cognition, inter alia: abacus versus mental arithmetic; alarm clock versus
knocker-upper; camera versus vision; and sweatshop versus tailor. Using novel
definitions and analyses, sociotechnical relationships can be analysed into
varying types of: displacement (harmful), enhancement (beneficial), and/or
replacement (neutral) of human cognitive labour. Ultimately, all AI implicates
human cognition; no matter what. Obfuscation of cognition in the AI context --
from clocks to artificial neural networks -- results in distortion, in slowing
critical engagement, perverting cognitive science, and indeed in limiting our
ability to truly centre humans and humanity in the engineering of AI systems.
To even begin to de-fetishise AI, we must look the human-in-the-loop in the
eyes.

TL;DR: 利用链式思维（CoT）提示微调开源LLM，自动从MRI/CT报告中提取胰腺囊性病变（PCL）特征并分类风险，性能媲美GPT-4o。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工提取PCL特征耗时，阻碍大规模研究，需自动化工具。

Method: 基于GPT-4o生成的CoT数据微调LLaMA和DeepSeek模型，按指南分类风险，评估模型性能。

Result: 微调后模型特征提取准确率达97%-98%，风险分类F1分数0.94-0.95，与放射科医生一致性高。

Conclusion: 微调开源LLM结合CoT监督，可实现高效、准确的PCL表型分析，性能与GPT-4o相当。

Abstract: Background: Manual extraction of pancreatic cystic lesion (PCL) features from
radiology reports is labor-intensive, limiting large-scale studies needed to
advance PCL research. Purpose: To develop and evaluate large language models
(LLMs) that automatically extract PCL features from MRI/CT reports and assign
risk categories based on guidelines. Materials and Methods: We curated a
training dataset of 6,000 abdominal MRI/CT reports (2005-2024) from 5,134
patients that described PCLs. Labels were generated by GPT-4o using
chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to extract PCL and main pancreatic duct
features. Two open-source LLMs were fine-tuned using QLoRA on GPT-4o-generated
CoT data. Features were mapped to risk categories per institutional guideline
based on the 2017 ACR White Paper. Evaluation was performed on 285 held-out
human-annotated reports. Model outputs for 100 cases were independently
reviewed by three radiologists. Feature extraction was evaluated using exact
match accuracy, risk categorization with macro-averaged F1 score, and
radiologist-model agreement with Fleiss' Kappa. Results: CoT fine-tuning
improved feature extraction accuracy for LLaMA (80% to 97%) and DeepSeek (79%
to 98%), matching GPT-4o (97%). Risk categorization F1 scores also improved
(LLaMA: 0.95; DeepSeek: 0.94), closely matching GPT-4o (0.97), with no
statistically significant differences. Radiologist inter-reader agreement was
high (Fleiss' Kappa = 0.888) and showed no statistically significant difference
with the addition of DeepSeek-FT-CoT (Fleiss' Kappa = 0.893) or GPT-CoT
(Fleiss' Kappa = 0.897), indicating that both models achieved agreement levels
on par with radiologists. Conclusion: Fine-tuned open-source LLMs with CoT
supervision enable accurate, interpretable, and efficient phenotyping for
large-scale PCL research, achieving performance comparable to GPT-4o.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 新兴应用（如全息通信、自动驾驶和工业物联网）对6G网络的资源分配提出了灵活、低延迟和高可靠性的要求，传统方法在动态环境中表现不佳，且实时获取CSI的开销较大。

Method: 利用数字孪生信道（DTC）预测CSI，结合轻量级博弈论算法进行在线资源分配。

Result: 仿真结果显示，该方法在吞吐量上比基于导频的理想CSI方案提高了11.5%。

Conclusion: 该方法为未来6G网络提供了可扩展、低开销且环境感知的通信解决方案。

Abstract: Emerging applications such as holographic communication, autonomous driving,
and the industrial Internet of Things impose stringent requirements on
flexible, low-latency, and reliable resource allocation in 6G networks.
Conventional methods, which rely on statistical modeling, have proven effective
in general contexts but may fail to achieve optimal performance in specific and
dynamic environments. Furthermore, acquiring real-time channel state
information (CSI) typically requires excessive pilot overhead. To address these
challenges, a digital twin channel (DTC)-enabled online optimization framework
is proposed, in which DTC is employed to predict CSI based on environmental
sensing. The predicted CSI is then utilized by lightweight game-theoretic
algorithms to perform online resource allocation in a timely and efficient
manner. Simulation results based on a digital replica of a realistic industrial
workshop demonstrate that the proposed method achieves throughput improvements
of up to 11.5\% compared with pilot-based ideal CSI schemes, validating its
effectiveness for scalable, low-overhead, and environment-aware communication
in future 6G networks.

Motivation: 旨在解决AI决策过程不透明的问题，通过对话式LLMs让用户理解AI如何得出结论，增强信任。

Method: 提出D-LLM框架，包含推理过程、偏好分类系统和对话方法，嵌入用户偏好至决策过程。

Result: 设想一个可解释的AI系统，用户可追踪和分析AI决策背后的偏好。

Conclusion: 通过透明化和个性化设计，D-LLM框架有望提升AI在人类决策中的可信度。

Abstract: This perspective paper explores the future potential of "conversational
intelligence" by examining how Large Language Models (LLMs) could be combined
with GRAPHYP's network system to better understand human conversations and
preferences. Using recent research and case studies, we propose a conceptual
framework that could make AI rea-soning transparent and traceable, allowing
humans to see and understand how AI reaches its conclusions. We present the
conceptual perspective of "Matching Game Preferences through Dialogical Large
Language Models (D-LLMs)," a proposed system that would allow multiple users to
share their different preferences through structured conversations. This
approach envisions personalizing LLMs by embedding individual user preferences
directly into how the model makes decisions. The proposed D-LLM framework would
require three main components: (1) reasoning processes that could analyze
different search experiences and guide performance, (2) classification systems
that would identify user preference patterns, and (3) dialogue approaches that
could help humans resolve conflicting information. This perspective framework
aims to create an interpretable AI system where users could examine,
understand, and combine the different human preferences that influence AI
responses, detected through GRAPHYP's search experience networks. The goal of
this perspective is to envision AI systems that would not only provide answers
but also show users how those answers were reached, making artificial
intelligence more transparent and trustworthy for human decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稳定室友问题在实际应用中并不总是有解，因此需要研究如何生成“足够好”的匹配方案。

Method: 结合代理的习惯、偏好及其朋友网络，提出了一种生成个性化稳定室友匹配的方法。

Result: 通过示例和实证评估验证了方法的实用性。

Conclusion: 该方法为解决稳定室友问题提供了一种有效的个性化解决方案。

Abstract: The Stable Roommates problems are characterized by the preferences of agents
over other agents as roommates. A solution is a partition of the agents into
pairs that are acceptable to each other (i.e., they are in the preference lists
of each other), and the matching is stable (i.e., there do not exist any two
agents who prefer each other to their roommates, and thus block the matching).
Motivated by real-world applications, and considering that stable roommates
problems do not always have solutions, we continue our studies to compute
"good-enough" matchings. In addition to the agents' habits and habitual
preferences, we consider their networks of preferred friends, and introduce a
method to generate personalized solutions to stable roommates problems. We
illustrate the usefulness of our method with examples and empirical
evaluations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PITA框架通过直接整合偏好反馈到LLM的token生成中，无需预训练奖励模型，实现了推理时对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖预训练奖励模型，可能导致不稳定；PITA旨在消除这一依赖。

Method: PITA学习一个基于偏好的小指导策略，在推理时修改token概率，无需微调LLM。

Result: 在数学推理和情感分类等任务中，PITA有效对齐LLM输出与用户偏好。

Conclusion: PITA提供了一种高效、无需奖励模型的推理时对齐方法。

Abstract: Inference-time alignment enables large language models (LLMs) to generate
outputs aligned with end-user preferences without further training. Recent
post-training methods achieve this by using small guidance models to modify
token generation during inference. These methods typically optimize a reward
function KL-regularized by the original LLM taken as the reference policy. A
critical limitation, however, is their dependence on a pre-trained reward
model, which requires fitting to human preference feedback--a potentially
unstable process. In contrast, we introduce PITA, a novel framework that
integrates preference feedback directly into the LLM's token generation,
eliminating the need for a reward model. PITA learns a small preference-based
guidance policy to modify token probabilities at inference time without LLM
fine-tuning, reducing computational cost and bypassing the pre-trained reward
model dependency. The problem is framed as identifying an underlying preference
distribution, solved through stochastic search and iterative refinement of the
preference-based guidance model. We evaluate PITA across diverse tasks,
including mathematical reasoning and sentiment classification, demonstrating
its effectiveness in aligning LLM outputs with user preferences.

<details>

Motivation: 尽管神经网络在多智能体强化学习中取得了进展，但其缺乏透明性和互操作性，特别是隐含的合作机制尚未完全理解。

Method: 提出CMQ方法，通过将合作概念表示为监督向量，利用全局状态嵌入的条件化个体动作值来增强合作表示能力。

Result: 在StarCraft II和LBF任务中，CMQ表现优于现有方法，并能捕捉有意义的合作模式，支持测试时概念干预。

Conclusion: CMQ通过可解释的合作概念提升了多智能体强化学习的透明性和性能，为潜在偏见和虚假合作模式提供了检测手段。

Abstract: Despite substantial progress in applying neural networks (NN) to multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) areas, they still largely suffer from a lack of
transparency and interoperability. However, its implicit cooperative mechanism
is not yet fully understood due to black-box networks. In this work, we study
an interpretable value decomposition framework via concept bottleneck models,
which promote trustworthiness by conditioning credit assignment on an
intermediate level of human-like cooperation concepts. To address this problem,
we propose a novel value-based method, named Concepts learning for Multi-agent
Q-learning (CMQ), that goes beyond the current performance-vs-interpretability
trade-off by learning interpretable cooperation concepts. CMQ represents each
cooperation concept as a supervised vector, as opposed to existing models where
the information flowing through their end-to-end mechanism is concept-agnostic.
Intuitively, using individual action value conditioning on global state
embeddings to represent each concept allows for extra cooperation
representation capacity. Empirical evaluations on the StarCraft II
micromanagement challenge and level-based foraging (LBF) show that CMQ achieves
superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art counterparts. The
results also demonstrate that CMQ provides more cooperation concept
representation capturing meaningful cooperation modes, and supports test-time
concept interventions for detecting potential biases of cooperation mode and
identifying spurious artifacts that impact cooperation.

Result: 理论框架统一解释了多种失败现象，证明熵正则化能恢复策略稳定性。

Conclusion: 该研究为设计更安全可信的AI系统提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) plays a crucial role in shaping the behavior of
large language and reasoning models (LLMs/LRMs). However, it often produces
brittle and unstable policies, leading to critical failures such as spurious
reasoning, deceptive alignment, and instruction disobedience that undermine the
trustworthiness and safety of LLMs/LRMs. Currently, these issues lack a unified
theoretical explanation and are typically addressed using ad-hoc heuristics.
This paper presents a rigorous mathematical framework for analyzing the
stability of the mapping from a reward function to the optimal policy. We show
that policy brittleness often stems from non-unique optimal actions, a common
occurrence when multiple valid traces exist in a reasoning task. This
theoretical lens provides a unified explanation for a range of seemingly
disparate failures, reframing them as rational outcomes of optimizing rewards
that may be incomplete or noisy, especially in the presence of action
degeneracy. We extend this analysis from the fundamental single-reward setting
to the more realistic multi-reward RL across diverse domains, showing how
stability is governed by an "effective reward" aggregation mechanism. We also
prove that entropy regularization restores policy stability at the cost of
increased stochasticity. Our framework provides a unified explanation for
recent empirical findings on deceptive reasoning, instruction-following
trade-offs, and RLHF-induced sophistry, and is further validated through
perturbation experiments in multi-reward RL. This work advances
policy-stability analysis from empirical heuristics towards a principled
theory, offering essential insights for designing safer and more trustworthy AI
systems.

Conclusion: HFrame在子图同态问题上表现出色，速度快、准确率高，且有理论误差界支持。

Abstract: Homomorphism is a key mapping technique between graphs that preserves their
structure. Given a graph and a pattern, the subgraph homomorphism problem
involves finding a mapping from the pattern to the graph, ensuring that
adjacent vertices in the pattern are mapped to adjacent vertices in the graph.
Unlike subgraph isomorphism, which requires a one-to-one mapping, homomorphism
allows multiple vertices in the pattern to map to the same vertex in the graph,
making it more complex. We propose HFrame, the first graph neural network-based
framework for subgraph homomorphism, which integrates traditional algorithms
with machine learning techniques. We demonstrate that HFrame outperforms
standard graph neural networks by being able to distinguish more graph pairs
where the pattern is not homomorphic to the graph. Additionally, we provide a
generalization error bound for HFrame. Through experiments on both real-world
and synthetic graphs, we show that HFrame is up to 101.91 times faster than
exact matching algorithms and achieves an average accuracy of 0.962.

Abstract: This paper presents the development of an AI powered software platform that
leverages advanced large language models (LLMs) to transform technology
scouting and solution discovery in industrial R&D. Traditional approaches to
solving complex research and development challenges are often time consuming,
manually driven, and heavily dependent on domain specific expertise. These
methods typically involve navigating fragmented sources such as patent
repositories, commercial product catalogs, and competitor data, leading to
inefficiencies and incomplete insights. The proposed platform utilizes cutting
edge LLM capabilities including semantic understanding, contextual reasoning,
and cross-domain knowledge extraction to interpret problem statements and
retrieve high-quality, sustainable solutions. The system processes unstructured
patent texts, such as claims and technical descriptions, and systematically
extracts potential innovations aligned with the given problem context. These
solutions are then algorithmically organized under standardized technical
categories and subcategories to ensure clarity and relevance across
interdisciplinary domains. In addition to patent analysis, the platform
integrates commercial intelligence by identifying validated market solutions
and active organizations addressing similar challenges. This combined insight
sourced from both intellectual property and real world product data enables R&D
teams to assess not only technical novelty but also feasibility, scalability,
and sustainability. The result is a comprehensive, AI driven scouting engine
that reduces manual effort, accelerates innovation cycles, and enhances
decision making in complex R&D environments.

scale of LLMs play a contributing role in their success, and the growth in
parameter count follows larger hidden dimensions. In this paper, we hypothesize
that while the increase in dimensions has been a key advantage, it may lead to
emergent problems as well. These problems emerge as the linear structures in
the activation space can be exploited, in the form of activation engineering,
to circumvent its safety alignment. Through detailed visualizations of linear
subspaces associated with different concepts, such as safety, across various
model scales, we show that the curse of high-dimensional representations
uniquely impacts LLMs. Further substantiating our claim, we demonstrate that
projecting the representations of the model onto a lower dimensional subspace
can preserve sufficient information for alignment while avoiding those linear
structures. Empirical results confirm that such dimensional reduction
significantly reduces susceptibility to jailbreaking through representation
engineering. Building on our empirical validations, we provide theoretical
insights into these linear jailbreaking methods relative to a model's hidden
dimensions. Broadly speaking, our work posits that the high dimensions of a
model's internal representations can be both a blessing and a curse in safety
alignment.

Conclusion: VLMPlanner通过视觉语言模型和动态推理机制，显著提升了自动驾驶规划的鲁棒性和效率。

Abstract: Integrating large language models (LLMs) into autonomous driving motion
planning has recently emerged as a promising direction, offering enhanced
interpretability, better controllability, and improved generalization in rare
and long-tail scenarios. However, existing methods often rely on abstracted
perception or map-based inputs, missing crucial visual context, such as
fine-grained road cues, accident aftermath, or unexpected obstacles, which are
essential for robust decision-making in complex driving environments. To bridge
this gap, we propose VLMPlanner, a hybrid framework that combines a
learning-based real-time planner with a vision-language model (VLM) capable of
reasoning over raw images. The VLM processes multi-view images to capture rich,
detailed visual information and leverages its common-sense reasoning
capabilities to guide the real-time planner in generating robust and safe
trajectories. Furthermore, we develop the Context-Adaptive Inference Gate
(CAI-Gate) mechanism that enables the VLM to mimic human driving behavior by
dynamically adjusting its inference frequency based on scene complexity,
thereby achieving an optimal balance between planning performance and
computational efficiency. We evaluate our approach on the large-scale,
challenging nuPlan benchmark, with comprehensive experimental results
demonstrating superior planning performance in scenarios with intricate road
conditions and dynamic elements. Code will be available.

*Farshid Nooshi,Suining He*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为HAG-PS的多智能体强化学习方法，用于动态分配城市移动资源，解决了策略共享和参数效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决城市环境中移动资源（如共享单车、电动滑板车）的动态分配问题，以平衡供需。

Method: 采用分层自适应分组参数共享（HAG-PS）方法，结合全局和局部信息，动态调整智能体分组，并使用可学习的ID嵌入实现专业化。

Result: 在纽约共享单车数据上验证，HAG-PS显著提高了资源可用性。

Conclusion: HAG-PS在动态资源分配中表现优越，解决了多智能体强化学习的关键挑战。

Abstract: Allocating mobility resources (e.g., shared bikes/e-scooters, ride-sharing
vehicles) is crucial for rebalancing the mobility demand and supply in the
urban environments. We propose in this work a novel multi-agent reinforcement
learning named Hierarchical Adaptive Grouping-based Parameter Sharing (HAG-PS)
for dynamic mobility resource allocation. HAG-PS aims to address two important
research challenges regarding multi-agent reinforcement learning for mobility
resource allocation: (1) how to dynamically and adaptively share the mobility
resource allocation policy (i.e., how to distribute mobility resources) across
agents (i.e., representing the regional coordinators of mobility resources);
and (2) how to achieve memory-efficient parameter sharing in an urban-scale
setting. To address the above challenges, we have provided following novel
designs within HAG-PS. To enable dynamic and adaptive parameter sharing, we
have designed a hierarchical approach that consists of global and local
information of the mobility resource states (e.g., distribution of mobility
resources). We have developed an adaptive agent grouping approach in order to
split or merge the groups of agents based on their relative closeness of
encoded trajectories (i.e., states, actions, and rewards). We have designed a
learnable identity (ID) embeddings to enable agent specialization beyond simple
parameter copy. We have performed extensive experimental studies based on
real-world NYC bike sharing data (a total of more than 1.2 million trips), and
demonstrated the superior performance (e.g., improved bike availability) of
HAG-PS compared with other baseline approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在机器人学和具身AI中的应用增多，理解其空间推理能力对实际部署至关重要。当前研究缺乏对无视觉输入下空间导航能力的评估。

Method: 通过坐标反馈和距离信息设计迷宫导航任务（5×5至15×15网格），评估8种LLMs在英语和冰岛语中的表现。

Result: OpenAI的O3模型表现最佳，而其他模型在9×9以上迷宫中出现灾难性失败。冰岛语下模型表现显著下降。

Conclusion: LLMs的空间推理能力受语言模式影响，需架构创新以提升跨语言可靠性。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly power autonomous agents in
robotics and embodied AI, understanding their spatial reasoning capabilities
becomes crucial for ensuring reliable real-world deployment. Despite advances
in language understanding, current research lacks evaluation of how LLMs
perform spatial navigation without visual cues, a fundamental requirement for
agents operating with limited sensory information. This paper addresses this
gap by introducing MazeEval, a benchmark designed to isolate and evaluate pure
spatial reasoning in LLMs through coordinate-based maze navigation tasks. Our
methodology employs a function-calling interface where models navigate mazes of
varying complexity ($5\times 5$ to $15\times 15$ grids) using only coordinate
feedback and distance-to-wall information, excluding visual input to test
fundamental spatial cognition. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art LLMs across
identical mazes in both English and Icelandic to assess cross-linguistic
transfer of spatial abilities. Our findings reveal striking disparities: while
OpenAI's O3 achieves perfect navigation for mazes up to size $30\times 30$,
other models exhibit catastrophic failure beyond $9\times 9$ mazes, with 100%
of failures attributed to excessive looping behavior where models revisit a
cell at least 10 times. We document a significant performance degradation in
Icelandic, with models solving mazes 3-4 sizes smaller than in English,
suggesting spatial reasoning in LLMs emerges from linguistic patterns rather
than language-agnostic mechanisms. These results have important implications
for global deployment of LLM-powered autonomous systems, showing spatial
intelligence remains fundamentally constrained by training data availability
and highlighting the need for architectural innovations to achieve reliable
navigation across linguistic contexts.

Abstract: In the context of the rapidly evolving information technology landscape,
marked by the advent of 6G communication networks, we face an increased data
volume and complexity in network environments. This paper addresses these
challenges by focusing on Quality of Service (QoS) in edge computing
frameworks. We propose a novel approach to enhance QoS through the development
of General Artificial Intelligence Lifelong Learning Systems, with a special
emphasis on Federated Layering Techniques (FLT). Our work introduces a
federated layering-based small model collaborative mechanism aimed at improving
AI models' operational efficiency and response time in environments where
resources are limited. This innovative method leverages the strengths of cloud
and edge computing, incorporating a negotiation and debate mechanism among
small AI models to enhance reasoning and decision-making processes. By
integrating model layering techniques with privacy protection measures, our
approach ensures the secure transmission of model parameters while maintaining
high efficiency in learning and reasoning capabilities. The experimental
results demonstrate that our strategy not only enhances learning efficiency and
reasoning accuracy but also effectively protects the privacy of edge nodes.
This presents a viable solution for achieving resilient large model lifelong
learning systems, with a significant improvement in QoS for edge computing
environments.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of traffic accident severity is critical for improving
road safety, optimizing emergency response strategies, and informing the design
of safer transportation infrastructure. However, existing approaches often
struggle to effectively model the intricate interdependencies among spatial,
temporal, and contextual variables that govern accident outcomes. In this
study, we introduce STARN-GAT, a Multi-Modal Spatio-Temporal Graph Attention
Network, which leverages adaptive graph construction and modality-aware
attention mechanisms to capture these complex relationships. Unlike
conventional methods, STARN-GAT integrates road network topology, temporal
traffic patterns, and environmental context within a unified attention-based
framework. The model is evaluated on the Fatality Analysis Reporting System
(FARS) dataset, achieving a Macro F1-score of 85 percent, ROC-AUC of 0.91, and
recall of 81 percent for severe incidents. To ensure generalizability within
the South Asian context, STARN-GAT is further validated on the ARI-BUET traffic
accident dataset, where it attains a Macro F1-score of 0.84, recall of 0.78,
and ROC-AUC of 0.89. These results demonstrate the model's effectiveness in
identifying high-risk cases and its potential for deployment in real-time,
safety-critical traffic management systems. Furthermore, the attention-based
architecture enhances interpretability, offering insights into contributing
factors and supporting trust in AI-assisted decision-making. Overall, STARN-GAT
bridges the gap between advanced graph neural network techniques and practical
applications in road safety analytics.

Result: 几乎所有代理在10-100次查询内出现策略违规，攻击在不同模型和任务间具有高转移性。

Conclusion: 当前AI代理存在严重漏洞，需加强防御措施。ART基准测试旨在推动更严格的安全评估。

Abstract: Recent advances have enabled LLM-powered AI agents to autonomously execute
complex tasks by combining language model reasoning with tools, memory, and web
access. But can these systems be trusted to follow deployment policies in
realistic environments, especially under attack? To investigate, we ran the
largest public red-teaming competition to date, targeting 22 frontier AI agents
across 44 realistic deployment scenarios. Participants submitted 1.8 million
prompt-injection attacks, with over 60,000 successfully eliciting policy
violations such as unauthorized data access, illicit financial actions, and
regulatory noncompliance. We use these results to build the Agent Red Teaming
(ART) benchmark - a curated set of high-impact attacks - and evaluate it across
19 state-of-the-art models. Nearly all agents exhibit policy violations for
most behaviors within 10-100 queries, with high attack transferability across
models and tasks. Importantly, we find limited correlation between agent
robustness and model size, capability, or inference-time compute, suggesting
that additional defenses are needed against adversarial misuse. Our findings
highlight critical and persistent vulnerabilities in today's AI agents. By
releasing the ART benchmark and accompanying evaluation framework, we aim to
support more rigorous security assessment and drive progress toward safer agent
deployment.

Motivation: 传统进化方法直接操作启发式代码，而MeLA通过优化LLM的指令提示生成启发式，结合元认知框架提升性能。

Conclusion: 研究表明，将认知科学应用于AI架构，通过元认知调节LLM的问题解决过程，为AHD提供了更鲁棒且可解释的路径。

Abstract: This paper introduces MeLA, a Metacognitive LLM-Driven Architecture that
presents a new paradigm for Automatic Heuristic Design (AHD). Traditional
evolutionary methods operate directly on heuristic code; in contrast, MeLA
evolves the instructional prompts used to guide a Large Language Model (LLM) in
generating these heuristics. This process of "prompt evolution" is driven by a
novel metacognitive framework where the system analyzes performance feedback to
systematically refine its generative strategy. MeLA's architecture integrates a
problem analyzer to construct an initial strategic prompt, an error diagnosis
system to repair faulty code, and a metacognitive search engine that
iteratively optimizes the prompt based on heuristic effectiveness. In
comprehensive experiments across both benchmark and real-world problems, MeLA
consistently generates more effective and robust heuristics, significantly
outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Ultimately, this research demonstrates
the profound potential of using cognitive science as a blueprint for AI
architecture, revealing that by enabling an LLM to metacognitively regulate its
problem-solving process, we unlock a more robust and interpretable path to AHD.

TL;DR: GraphDPO是一个基于直接偏好优化（DPO）的知识遗忘框架，用于从知识图谱嵌入模型中有效移除特定信息，同时保留剩余知识的完整性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识图谱（KGs）中存在过时或错误的知识，需要从知识图谱嵌入（KGE）模型中移除。现有遗忘方法存在高训练成本或无法完全移除目标信息的问题。

Method: GraphDPO将遗忘问题重构为偏好优化问题，利用DPO训练模型偏好重构的替代三元组而非原始遗忘三元组，并引入边界外采样策略和边界回忆机制。

Result: 实验表明，GraphDPO在四个流行KGs上的八个遗忘数据集上，MRR_Avg和MRR_F1分别提升10.1%和14.0%。

Conclusion: GraphDPO通过偏好优化和边界知识保留机制，有效解决了知识遗忘中的信息移除和知识保留问题。

Abstract: Existing knowledge graphs (KGs) inevitably contain outdated or erroneous
knowledge that needs to be removed from knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models.
To address this challenge, knowledge unlearning can be applied to eliminate
specific information while preserving the integrity of the remaining knowledge
in KGs. Existing unlearning methods can generally be categorized into exact
unlearning and approximate unlearning. However, exact unlearning requires high
training costs while approximate unlearning faces two issues when applied to
KGs due to the inherent connectivity of triples: (1) It fails to fully remove
targeted information, as forgetting triples can still be inferred from
remaining ones. (2) It focuses on local data for specific removal, which
weakens the remaining knowledge in the forgetting boundary. To address these
issues, we propose GraphDPO, a novel approximate unlearning framework based on
direct preference optimization (DPO). Firstly, to effectively remove forgetting
triples, we reframe unlearning as a preference optimization problem, where the
model is trained by DPO to prefer reconstructed alternatives over the original
forgetting triples. This formulation penalizes reliance on forgettable
knowledge, mitigating incomplete forgetting caused by KG connectivity.
Moreover, we introduce an out-boundary sampling strategy to construct
preference pairs with minimal semantic overlap, weakening the connection
between forgetting and retained knowledge. Secondly, to preserve boundary
knowledge, we introduce a boundary recall mechanism that replays and distills
relevant information both within and across time steps. We construct eight
unlearning datasets across four popular KGs with varying unlearning rates.
Experiments show that GraphDPO outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to
10.1% in MRR_Avg and 14.0% in MRR_F1.

Conclusion: 该方法为LMM优化设定了新标准，实现了内存效率与性能的平衡。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have advanced significantly by integrating
visual encoders with extensive language models, enabling robust reasoning
capabilities. However, compressing LMMs for deployment on edge devices remains
a critical challenge. In this work, we propose an adaptive search algorithm
that optimizes sparsity and KV cache compression to enhance LMM efficiency.
Utilizing the Tree-structured Parzen Estimator, our method dynamically adjusts
pruning ratios and KV cache quantization bandwidth across different LMM layers,
using model performance as the optimization objective. This approach uniquely
combines pruning with key-value cache quantization and incorporates a fast
pruning technique that eliminates the need for additional fine-tuning or weight
adjustments, achieving efficient compression without compromising accuracy.
Comprehensive evaluations on benchmark datasets, including LLaVA-1.5 7B and
13B, demonstrate our method superiority over state-of-the-art techniques such
as SparseGPT and Wanda across various compression levels. Notably, our
framework automatic allocation of KV cache compression resources sets a new
standard in LMM optimization, delivering memory efficiency without sacrificing
much performance.

Conclusion: MoCME框架有效提升多模态知识图谱补全的鲁棒性和表现。

Abstract: Multi-modal Knowledge Graph Completion (MMKGC) aims to uncover hidden world
knowledge in multimodal knowledge graphs by leveraging both multimodal and
structural entity information. However, the inherent imbalance in multimodal
knowledge graphs, where modality distributions vary across entities, poses
challenges in utilizing additional modality data for robust entity
representation. Existing MMKGC methods typically rely on attention or
gate-based fusion mechanisms but overlook complementarity contained in
multi-modal data. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named Mixture of
Complementary Modality Experts (MoCME), which consists of a
Complementarity-guided Modality Knowledge Fusion (CMKF) module and an
Entropy-guided Negative Sampling (EGNS) mechanism. The CMKF module exploits
both intra-modal and inter-modal complementarity to fuse multi-view and
multi-modal embeddings, enhancing representations of entities. Additionally, we
introduce an Entropy-guided Negative Sampling mechanism to dynamically
prioritize informative and uncertain negative samples to enhance training
effectiveness and model robustness. Extensive experiments on five benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our MoCME achieves state-of-the-art performance,
surpassing existing approaches.

Abstract: At present, state-of-the-art forecasting models are short of the ability to
capture spatio-temporal dependency and synthesize global information at the
stage of learning. To address this issue, in this paper, through the adaptive
fuzzified construction of temporal data, we propose a novel convolutional
architecture with partially asymmetric design based on the scheme of sliding
window to realize accurate time series forecasting. First, the construction
strategy of traditional fuzzy time series is improved to further extract short
and long term temporal interrelation, which enables every time node to
automatically possess corresponding global information and inner relationships
among them in a restricted sliding window and the process does not require
human involvement. Second, a bilateral Atrous algorithm is devised to reduce
calculation demand of the proposed model without sacrificing global
characteristics of elements. And it also allows the model to avoid processing
redundant information. Third, after the transformation of time series, a
partially asymmetric convolutional architecture is designed to more flexibly
mine data features by filters in different directions on feature maps, which
gives the convolutional neural network (CNN) the ability to construct
sub-windows within existing sliding windows to model at a more fine-grained
level. And after obtaining the time series information at different levels, the
multi-scale features from different sub-windows will be sent to the
corresponding network layer for time series information fusion. Compared with
other competitive modern models, the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
results on most of popular time series datasets, which is fully verified by the
experimental results.

real-world applications in warehouses with the presence of humans, we introduce
1) a general definition for D-MAPF (applicable to variations of D-MAPF), 2) a
new framework to solve D-MAPF (utilizing multi-shot computation, and allowing
different methods to solve D-MAPF), and 3) a new ASP-based method to solve

concept of tunnels to specify where agents can move). We have illustrated the
strengths and weaknesses of this method by experimental evaluations, from the
perspectives of computational performance and quality of solutions.

Abstract: Fairness in AI is traditionally studied as a static property evaluated once,
over a fixed dataset. However, real-world AI systems operate sequentially, with
outcomes and environments evolving over time. This paper proposes a framework
for analysing fairness as a runtime property. Using a minimal yet expressive
model based on sequences of coin tosses with possibly evolving biases, we study
the problems of monitoring and enforcing fairness expressed in either toss
outcomes or coin biases. Since there is no one-size-fits-all solution for
either problem, we provide a summary of monitoring and enforcement strategies,
parametrised by environment dynamics, prediction horizon, and confidence
thresholds. For both problems, we present general results under simple or
minimal assumptions. We survey existing solutions for the monitoring problem
for Markovian and additive dynamics, and existing solutions for the enforcement
problem in static settings with known dynamics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在伦理AI中，将AI系统与人类价值及不同利益相关者的价值偏好对齐是关键。现有方法难以手动校准个体价值系统，而社会科学的观点认为社会价值系统应视为不同群体的价值系统集合。

Method: 提出一种基于启发式深度聚类的方法，通过学习社会共享的价值基础和多样化的价值系统，从代理样本中观察定性价值偏好。

Result: 在旅行决策的实际数据用例中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为学习社会价值系统提供了新途径，有助于更准确地建模社会价值多样性。

Abstract: Aligning AI systems with human values and the value-based preferences of
various stakeholders (their value systems) is key in ethical AI. In value-aware
AI systems, decision-making draws upon explicit computational representations
of individual values (groundings) and their aggregation into value systems. As
these are notoriously difficult to elicit and calibrate manually, value
learning approaches aim to automatically derive computational models of an
agent's values and value system from demonstrations of human behaviour.
Nonetheless, social science and humanities literature suggest that it is more
adequate to conceive the value system of a society as a set of value systems of
different groups, rather than as the simple aggregation of individual value
systems. Accordingly, here we formalize the problem of learning the value
systems of societies and propose a method to address it based on heuristic deep
clustering. The method learns socially shared value groundings and a set of
diverse value systems representing a given society by observing qualitative
value-based preferences from a sample of agents. We evaluate the proposal in a

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI模型通过优化干预时间提升用户听力和健康行为，显著改善母婴健康。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自动语音呼叫项目中用户流失和参与度低的问题，并验证AI干预是否能转化为健康行为改善。

Method: 使用AI模型（如多臂老虎机模型）识别最需要干预的用户，并评估其对健康行为的影响。

Result: AI干预显著提高了用户听力，并改善了健康行为（如补充铁和钙）和健康知识。

Conclusion: AI在母婴健康领域具有推动实质性改善的潜力。

Abstract: Automated voice calls with health information are a proven method for
disseminating maternal and child health information among beneficiaries and are
deployed in several programs around the world. However, these programs often
suffer from beneficiary dropoffs and poor engagement. In previous work, through
real-world trials, we showed that an AI model, specifically a restless bandit
model, could identify beneficiaries who would benefit most from live service
call interventions, preventing dropoffs and boosting engagement. However, one
key question has remained open so far: does such improved listenership via
AI-targeted interventions translate into beneficiaries' improved knowledge and
health behaviors? We present a first study that shows not only listenership
improvements due to AI interventions, but also simultaneously links these
improvements to health behavior changes. Specifically, we demonstrate that
AI-scheduled interventions, which enhance listenership, lead to statistically
significant improvements in beneficiaries' health behaviors such as taking iron
or calcium supplements in the postnatal period, as well as understanding of
critical health topics during pregnancy and infancy. This underscores the
potential of AI to drive meaningful improvements in maternal and child health.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文分析了Chain-of-Thought (CoT)提示的内部机制，发现其通过解码空间剪枝和任务依赖的神经元调节提升推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管CoT显著提升了模型推理能力，但其内部机制尚不明确，研究旨在揭示其运作原理。

Method: 通过反向追踪信息流（解码、投影和激活阶段）进行定量分析，探讨CoT如何利用答案模板引导输出生成。

Result: CoT可能作为解码空间剪枝工具，且神经元激活模式因任务类型而异（开放任务减少，封闭任务增加）。

Conclusion: 研究为CoT的机制解释提供了新框架，并为设计高效、鲁棒的提示提供了关键见解。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting significantly enhances model reasoning, yet
its internal mechanisms remain poorly understood. We analyze CoT's operational
principles by reversely tracing information flow across decoding, projection,
and activation phases. Our quantitative analysis suggests that CoT may serve as
a decoding space pruner, leveraging answer templates to guide output
generation, with higher template adherence strongly correlating with improved
performance. Furthermore, we surprisingly find that CoT modulates neuron
engagement in a task-dependent manner: reducing neuron activation in
open-domain tasks, yet increasing it in closed-domain scenarios. These findings
offer a novel mechanistic interpretability framework and critical insights for
enabling targeted CoT interventions to design more efficient and robust
prompts. We released our code and data at

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为evalSmarT的框架，利用大语言模型（LLMs）评估智能合约注释生成的质量，解决了传统指标和人工评估的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能合约注释生成的质量评估缺乏有效的指标，传统方法（如BLEU和ROUGE）无法捕捉领域特性，人工评估则成本高且难以扩展。

Method: 开发了evalSmarT框架，结合约40种LLMs和10种提示策略，支持400多种评估配置，用于评估注释生成工具。

Result: 实验表明，提示设计显著影响与人工判断的一致性，LLM评估提供了可扩展且语义丰富的替代方案。

Conclusion: evalSmarT为智能合约注释生成的质量评估提供了一种高效、灵活且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Smart contract comment generation has gained traction as a means to improve
code comprehension and maintainability in blockchain systems. However,
evaluating the quality of generated comments remains a challenge. Traditional
metrics such as BLEU and ROUGE fail to capture domain-specific nuances, while
human evaluation is costly and unscalable. In this paper, we present
\texttt{evalSmarT}, a modular and extensible framework that leverages large
language models (LLMs) as evaluators. The system supports over 400 evaluator
configurations by combining approximately 40 LLMs with 10 prompting strategies.
We demonstrate its application in benchmarking comment generation tools and
selecting the most informative outputs. Our results show that prompt design
significantly impacts alignment with human judgment, and that LLM-based
evaluation offers a scalable and semantically rich alternative to existing
methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG方法在多模态信息融合和知识结构捕捉上存在不足，且需要大规模任务特定训练，泛化能力有限。

Method: 提出MMGraphRAG，利用场景图细化视觉内容，构建MMKG，结合文本知识图谱，通过谱聚类实现跨模态实体链接，并沿推理路径检索上下文以指导生成。

Result: 在DocBench和MMLongBench数据集上取得最优性能，表现出强大的领域适应性和清晰的推理路径。

Conclusion: MMGraphRAG通过多模态知识图谱和推理路径检索，显著提升了生成模型的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances language model generation by
retrieving relevant information from external knowledge bases. However,
conventional RAG methods face the issue of missing multimodal information.
Multimodal RAG methods address this by fusing images and text through mapping
them into a shared embedding space, but they fail to capture the structure of
knowledge and logical chains between modalities. Moreover, they also require
large-scale training for specific tasks, resulting in limited generalizing
ability. To address these limitations, we propose MMGraphRAG, which refines
visual content through scene graphs and constructs a multimodal knowledge graph
(MMKG) in conjunction with text-based KG. It employs spectral clustering to
achieve cross-modal entity linking and retrieves context along reasoning paths
to guide the generative process. Experimental results show that MMGraphRAG
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the DocBench and MMLongBench datasets,
demonstrating strong domain adaptability and clear reasoning paths.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的离线算法POMCGS，用于解决大规模POMDP问题，通过动态折叠搜索树减少计算量，并支持连续POMDP。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有离线算法无法处理大规模POMDP，而在线方法在时间或能量受限的应用中不适用。

Method: POMCGS算法动态折叠搜索树构建策略图，结合动作渐进扩展和观测聚类方法。

Result: POMCGS能处理此前离线算法无法解决的最具挑战性POMDP问题，且策略性能与先进在线算法相当。

Conclusion: POMCGS为大规模POMDP提供了一种高效的离线解决方案，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Currently, large partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) are
often solved by sampling-based online methods which interleave planning and
execution phases. However, a pre-computed offline policy is more desirable in
POMDP applications with time or energy constraints. But previous offline
algorithms are not able to scale up to large POMDPs. In this article, we
propose a new sampling-based algorithm, the partially observable Monte-Carlo
graph search (POMCGS) to solve large POMDPs offline. Different from many online
POMDP methods, which progressively develop a tree while performing
(Monte-Carlo) simulations, POMCGS folds this search tree on the fly to
construct a policy graph, so that computations can be drastically reduced, and
users can analyze and validate the policy prior to embedding and executing it.
Moreover, POMCGS, together with action progressive widening and observation
clustering methods provided in this article, is able to address certain
continuous POMDPs. Through experiments, we demonstrate that POMCGS can generate
policies on the most challenging POMDPs, which cannot be computed by previous
offline algorithms, and these policies' values are competitive compared with
the state-of-the-art online POMDP algorithms.

Motivation: 研究大型神经语言模型的推理限制，解释其在高阶逻辑表达上的不足。

Method: 将神经网络视为逻辑谓词空间上的线性算子，分析其深度与逻辑表达能力的关系。

Result: 证明神经网络深度限制了高阶逻辑表达，解释了幻觉、重复等现象。

Conclusion: 为未来语言模型的架构扩展和可解释性策略提供了理论基础。

Abstract: We propose a formal model of reasoning limitations in large neural net models
for language, grounded in the depth of their neural architecture. By treating
neural networks as linear operators over logic predicate space we show that
each layer can encode at most one additional level of logical reasoning. We
prove that a neural network of depth a particular depth cannot faithfully
represent predicates in a one higher order logic, such as simple counting over
complex predicates, implying a strict upper bound on logical expressiveness.
This structure induces a nontrivial null space during tokenization and
embedding, excluding higher-order predicates from representability. Our
framework offers a natural explanation for phenomena such as hallucination,
repetition, and limited planning, while also providing a foundation for
understanding how approximations to higher-order logic may emerge. These
results motivate architectural extensions and interpretability strategies in
future development of language models.

Result: 提供了 LLM 代理失败模式的可操作见解，为减少幻觉奠定基础。

Conclusion: MIRAGE-Bench 为交互环境中幻觉的缓解提供了系统性方法和评估工具。

Abstract: Hallucinations pose critical risks for large language model (LLM)-based
agents, often manifesting as hallucinative actions resulting from fabricated or
misinterpreted information within the cognitive context. While recent studies
have exposed such failures, existing evaluations remain fragmented and lack a
principled testbed. In this paper, we present MIRAGE-Bench--Measuring Illusions
in Risky AGEnt settings--the first unified benchmark for eliciting and
evaluating hallucinations in interactive LLM-agent scenarios. We begin by
introducing a three-part taxonomy to address agentic hallucinations: actions
that are unfaithful to (i) task instructions, (ii) execution history, or (iii)
environment observations. To analyze, we first elicit such failures by
performing a systematic audit of existing agent benchmarks, then synthesize
test cases using a snapshot strategy that isolates decision points in
deterministic and reproducible manners. To evaluate hallucination behaviors, we
adopt a fine-grained-level LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm with tailored risk-aware
prompts, enabling scalable, high-fidelity assessment of agent actions without
enumerating full action spaces. MIRAGE-Bench provides actionable insights on
failure modes of LLM agents and lays the groundwork for principled progress in
mitigating hallucinations in interactive environments.

Motivation: 尽管ASP在产品配置中应用成功，但交互式系统在有效引导用户完成配置过程方面仍存在挑战。本文旨在解决大规模工业配置问题，并通过API支持直观用户界面。

Method: 采用经典增量方法的多轮求解，通过四种智能扩展功能，利用谨慎和勇敢的后果确定并添加特定对象或关联，减少不可满足性检查。

Result: 该方法限制了成本高昂的不可满足性检查次数，缩小了搜索空间，从而提高了求解性能。

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提升了交互式配置的性能，并通过API实现了直观的用户界面。

Abstract: Product configuration is a successful application of Answer Set Programming
(ASP). However, challenges are still open for interactive systems to
effectively guide users through the configuration process. The aim of our work
is to provide an ASP-based solver for interactive configuration that can deal
with large-scale industrial configuration problems and that supports intuitive
user interfaces via an API. In this paper, we focus on improving the
performance of automatically completing a partial configuration. Our main
contribution enhances the classical incremental approach for multi-shot solving
by four different smart expansion functions. The core idea is to determine and
add specific objects or associations to the partial configuration by exploiting
cautious and brave consequences before checking for the existence of a complete
configuration with the current objects in each iteration. This approach limits
the number of costly unsatisfiability checks and reduces the search space,
thereby improving solving performance. In addition, we present a user interface
that uses our API and is implemented in ASP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在动态交互环境中的静态特性成为瓶颈，需要开发能够实时适应和进化的代理。

Method: 围绕‘进化什么’、‘何时进化’和‘如何进化’三个维度，分类分析了进化机制、适应方法和算法设计。

Result: 综述了自进化代理的评估指标、应用领域（如编程、教育和医疗），并指出了安全性、可扩展性等挑战。

Conclusion: 为自进化代理的研究和实际部署提供了框架，为实现人工超级智能（ASI）奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities but remain
fundamentally static, unable to adapt their internal parameters to novel tasks,
evolving knowledge domains, or dynamic interaction contexts. As LLMs are
increasingly deployed in open-ended, interactive environments, this static
nature has become a critical bottleneck, necessitating agents that can
adaptively reason, act, and evolve in real time. This paradigm shift -- from
scaling static models to developing self-evolving agents -- has sparked growing
interest in architectures and methods enabling continual learning and
adaptation from data, interactions, and experiences. This survey provides the
first systematic and comprehensive review of self-evolving agents, organized
around three foundational dimensions -- what to evolve, when to evolve, and how
to evolve. We examine evolutionary mechanisms across agent components (e.g.,
models, memory, tools, architecture), categorize adaptation methods by stages
(e.g., intra-test-time, inter-test-time), and analyze the algorithmic and
architectural designs that guide evolutionary adaptation (e.g., scalar rewards,
textual feedback, single-agent and multi-agent systems). Additionally, we
analyze evaluation metrics and benchmarks tailored for self-evolving agents,
highlight applications in domains such as coding, education, and healthcare,
and identify critical challenges and research directions in safety,
scalability, and co-evolutionary dynamics. By providing a structured framework
for understanding and designing self-evolving agents, this survey establishes a
roadmap for advancing adaptive agentic systems in both research and real-world
deployments, ultimately shedding lights to pave the way for the realization of
Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI), where agents evolve autonomously,
performing at or beyond human-level intelligence across a wide array of tasks.

Method: 研究比较了多种Transformer模型和LSTM模型，使用Reddit数据构建大型标注数据集，并通过统计分析和主题建模验证其可靠性。

Result: RoBERTa表现最佳（F1分数99.54%），而结合BERT嵌入的LSTM模型在外部测试集上表现优异（F1分数94%以上）且计算资源需求低。

Abstract: The rising prevalence of mental health disorders necessitates the development
of robust, automated tools for early detection and monitoring. Recent advances
in Natural Language Processing (NLP), particularly transformer-based
architectures, have demonstrated significant potential in text analysis. This
study provides a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art transformer
models (BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, ALBERT, and ELECTRA) against Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) based approaches using different text embedding techniques for
mental health disorder classification on Reddit. We construct a large annotated
dataset, validating its reliability through statistical judgmental analysis and
topic modeling. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of
transformer models over traditional deep-learning approaches. RoBERTa achieved
the highest classification performance, with a 99.54% F1 score on the hold-out
test set and a 96.05% F1 score on the external test set. Notably, LSTM models
augmented with BERT embeddings proved highly competitive, achieving F1 scores
exceeding 94% on the external dataset while requiring significantly fewer
computational resources. These findings highlight the effectiveness of
transformer-based models for real-time, scalable mental health monitoring. We
discuss the implications for clinical applications and digital mental health
interventions, offering insights into the capabilities and limitations of
state-of-the-art NLP methodologies in mental disorder detection.

Conclusion: 论文首次解决了框架生成中的评估模糊性和编辑技术问题，为文档比较提供了更有效的工具。

Abstract: The increasing volume of academic literature makes it essential for
researchers to organize, compare, and contrast collections of documents. Large
language models (LLMs) can support this process by generating schemas defining
shared aspects along which to compare papers. However, progress on schema
generation has been slow due to: (i) ambiguity in reference-based evaluations,
and (ii) lack of editing/refinement methods. Our work is the first to address
both issues. First, we present an approach for augmenting unannotated table
corpora with synthesized intents and apply it to create a dataset for studying
schema generation conditioned on a given information need, thus reducing
ambiguity. With this dataset, we show how incorporating table intents
significantly improves baseline performance in reconstructing reference
schemas. Next, we propose several LLM-based schema editing techniques. We start
by comprehensively benchmarking several single-shot schema generation methods,
including prompted LLM workflows and fine-tuned models, showing that smaller,
open-weight models can be fine-tuned to be competitive with state-of-the-art
prompted LLMs. Then we demonstrate that our editing techniques can further
improve schemas generated by these methods.

Abstract: We introduce WOKIE, an open-source, modular, and ready-to-use pipeline for
the automated translation of SKOS thesauri. This work addresses a critical need
in the Digital Humanities (DH), where language diversity can limit access,

to run on everyday hardware and be easily extended, the application requires no
prior expertise in machine translation or LLMs. We evaluate WOKIE across
several DH thesauri in 15 languages with different parameters, translation
services and LLMs, systematically analysing translation quality, performance,

enhance the accessibility, reuse, and cross-lingual interoperability of
thesauri by hurdle-free automated translation and improved ontology matching
performance, supporting more inclusive and multilingual research
infrastructures.

Motivation: LLMs在地理空间任务中存在幻觉问题（错误或不一致的地理信息表示），但相关研究较少，亟需系统评估和缓解方法。

Method: 提出基于结构化地理空间知识图谱的评估框架，并引入Kahneman-Tversky优化（KTO）的动态事实对齐方法。

Result: 在20个先进LLMs上评估，发现地理空间幻觉问题，KTO方法使性能提升29.6%。

Conclusion: 提出的框架和方法有效提升了LLMs在地理空间知识和推理任务中的可信度。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) possess extensive world knowledge, including
geospatial knowledge, which has been successfully applied to various geospatial
tasks such as mobility prediction and social indicator prediction. However,
LLMs often generate inaccurate geospatial knowledge, leading to geospatial
hallucinations (incorrect or inconsistent representations of geospatial
information) that compromise their reliability. While the phenomenon of general
knowledge hallucination in LLMs has been widely studied, the systematic
evaluation and mitigation of geospatial hallucinations remain largely
unexplored. To address this gap, we propose a comprehensive evaluation
framework for geospatial hallucinations, leveraging structured geospatial
knowledge graphs for controlled assessment. Through extensive evaluation across
20 advanced LLMs, we uncover the hallucinations in their geospatial knowledge.
Building on these insights, we introduce a dynamic factuality aligning method
based on Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) to mitigate geospatial
hallucinations in LLMs, leading to a performance improvement of over 29.6% on
the proposed benchmark. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our benchmark and learning algorithm in enhancing the
trustworthiness of LLMs in geospatial knowledge and reasoning tasks.

Motivation: 自注意力的二次时间和内存复杂度限制了长上下文建模的效率，因此需要研究高效注意力机制以提升模型的可扩展性。

Method: 论文系统性地综述了线性注意力和稀疏注意力两种方法，前者通过核近似、循环公式或快速权重动态实现线性复杂度，后者通过固定模式、块路由或聚类策略选择部分token进行计算。

Result: 论文整合了算法创新和硬件层面的考虑，并分析了高效注意力在大规模预训练语言模型中的应用，包括纯高效注意力架构和混合设计。

Conclusion: 该研究为设计可扩展且高效的语言模型提供了理论基础和实践参考。

Abstract: Transformer-based architectures have become the prevailing backbone of large
language models. However, the quadratic time and memory complexity of
self-attention remains a fundamental obstacle to efficient long-context
modeling. To address this limitation, recent research has introduced two
principal categories of efficient attention mechanisms. Linear attention
methods achieve linear complexity through kernel approximations, recurrent
formulations, or fastweight dynamics, thereby enabling scalable inference with
reduced computational overhead. Sparse attention techniques, in contrast, limit
attention computation to selected subsets of tokens based on fixed patterns,
block-wise routing, or clustering strategies, enhancing efficiency while
preserving contextual coverage. This survey provides a systematic and
comprehensive overview of these developments, integrating both algorithmic
innovations and hardware-level considerations. In addition, we analyze the
incorporation of efficient attention into largescale pre-trained language
models, including both architectures built entirely on efficient attention and
hybrid designs that combine local and global components. By aligning
theoretical foundations with practical deployment strategies, this work aims to
serve as a foundational reference for advancing the design of scalable and
efficient language models.

Result: 实验显示LLMs在多轮攻击下脆弱，但微调后拒绝率提升32.4%。

Conclusion: 微调能显著提升LLMs对多轮恶意提示的防御能力，无需额外监督。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly
enhanced their code generation capabilities. However, their robustness against
adversarial misuse, particularly through multi-turn malicious coding prompts,
remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce code decomposition attacks,
where a malicious coding task is broken down into a series of seemingly benign
subtasks across multiple conversational turns to evade safety filters. To
facilitate systematic evaluation, we introduce \benchmarkname{}, a large-scale
benchmark designed to evaluate the robustness of code LLMs against both
single-turn and multi-turn malicious prompts. Empirical results across open-
and closed-source models reveal persistent vulnerabilities, especially under
multi-turn scenarios. Fine-tuning on MOCHA improves rejection rates while
preserving coding ability, and importantly, enhances robustness on external
adversarial datasets with up to 32.4% increase in rejection rates without any
additional supervision.

Result: 平均BLEU得分：英语到印度语28.88，印度语到英语27.86；Chain-of-Thought方法在某些情况下显著提升翻译质量（如泰米尔语到英语BLEU提升13.84）。

Conclusion: 端到端系统有效，但Chain-of-Thought方法的输出格式一致性仍需改进。

Abstract: This paper presents HITSZ's submission for the IWSLT 2025 Indic track,
focusing on speech-to-text translation (ST) for English-to-Indic and
Indic-to-English language pairs. To enhance translation quality in this
low-resource scenario, we propose an end-to-end system integrating the
pre-trained Whisper automated speech recognition (ASR) model with Krutrim, an
Indic-specialized large language model (LLM). Experimental results demonstrate
that our end-to-end system achieved average BLEU scores of $28.88$ for
English-to-Indic directions and $27.86$ for Indic-to-English directions.
Furthermore, we investigated the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) method. While this
method showed potential for significant translation quality improvements on
successfully parsed outputs (e.g. a $13.84$ BLEU increase for
Tamil-to-English), we observed challenges in ensuring the model consistently
adheres to the required CoT output format.

TL;DR: MCIF是一个多语言、多模态的基准测试，用于评估大语言模型在多语言和多模态任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试在评估多语言和多模态能力时存在不足，如局限于英语、单一模态或短文本，缺乏全面性。

Method: 引入MCIF基准测试，涵盖语音、视觉和文本三种模态及四种语言，基于科学讲座进行人工标注。

Result: MCIF为全面评估模型在多语言、多模态任务中的表现提供了工具。

Conclusion: MCIF的发布旨在推动多模态大语言模型的开放研究和进步。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have catalyzed the development of
multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) that integrate text, speech, and vision within unified
frameworks. As MLLMs evolve from narrow, monolingual, task-specific systems to
general-purpose instruction-following models, a key frontier lies in evaluating
their multilingual and multimodal capabilities over both long and short
contexts. However, existing benchmarks fall short in evaluating these
dimensions jointly: they are often limited to English, mostly focus on one
single modality at a time, rely on short-form contexts, or lack human
annotations -- hindering comprehensive assessment of model performance across
languages, modalities, and task complexity. To address these gaps, we introduce
MCIF (Multimodal Crosslingual Instruction Following), the first multilingual
human-annotated benchmark based on scientific talks that is designed to
evaluate instruction-following in crosslingual, multimodal settings over both
short- and long-form inputs. MCIF spans three core modalities -- speech,
vision, and text -- and four diverse languages (English, German, Italian, and
Chinese), enabling a comprehensive evaluation of MLLMs' abilities to interpret
instructions across languages and combine them with multimodal contextual
information. MCIF is released under a CC-BY 4.0 license to encourage open
research and progress in MLLMs development.

Motivation: 填补罗马尼亚语等资源不足语言在法律教育中的AI工具空白，评估LLMs和VLMs在法律问答任务中的能力。

Method: 引入RoD-TAL数据集，结合RAG管道、密集检索器和推理优化模型，评估文本和视觉问答任务。

Result: 领域特定微调显著提升检索性能，推理模型提高问答准确率，但视觉推理仍具挑战性。

Conclusion: LLMs和VLMs在法律教育中具有潜力，但视觉推理仍需改进。

Abstract: The intersection of AI and legal systems presents a growing need for tools
that support legal education, particularly in under-resourced languages such as
Romanian. In this work, we aim to evaluate the capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in understanding and reasoning
about Romanian driving law through textual and visual question-answering tasks.
To facilitate this, we introduce RoD-TAL, a novel multimodal dataset comprising
Romanian driving test questions, text-based and image-based, alongside
annotated legal references and human explanations. We implement and assess
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines, dense retrievers, and
reasoning-optimized models across tasks including Information Retrieval (IR),
Question Answering (QA), Visual IR, and Visual QA. Our experiments demonstrate
that domain-specific fine-tuning significantly enhances retrieval performance.
At the same time, chain-of-thought prompting and specialized reasoning models
improve QA accuracy, surpassing the minimum grades required to pass driving
exams. However, visual reasoning remains challenging, highlighting the
potential and the limitations of applying LLMs and VLMs to legal education.

TL;DR: 论文研究了多语言和单语言大语言模型（LLM）在阿拉伯语、英语和印度语言中的表现，重点关注模型压缩策略（如剪枝和量化）的影响。发现多语言模型普遍优于单语言模型，量化能保持准确性，而激进剪枝会显著降低性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM在低资源语言环境（如阿拉伯语和印度语言）中的表现，以及模型压缩策略对性能的影响。

Method: 通过基准测试比较多语言和单语言LLM的性能，分析剪枝和量化策略的效果。

Result: 多语言模型表现更优，量化有效但剪枝会损害性能，尤其在大型模型中。

Conclusion: 研究为构建可扩展且公平的多语言NLP解决方案提供了关键策略，并强调需解决低资源环境中的幻觉和泛化错误。

Abstract: Although LLMs have attained significant success in high-resource languages,
their capacity in low-resource linguistic environments like Kannada and Arabic
is not yet fully understood. This work benchmarking the performance of
multilingual and monolingual Large Language Models (LLMs) across Arabic,
English, and Indic languages, with particular emphasis on the effects of model
compression strategies such as pruning and quantization. Findings shows
significant performance differences driven by linguistic diversity and resource
availability on SOTA LLMS as BLOOMZ, AceGPT, Jais, LLaMA-2, XGLM, and AraGPT2.
We find that multilingual versions of the model outperform their
language-specific counterparts across the board, indicating substantial
cross-lingual transfer benefits. Quantization (4-bit and 8-bit) is effective in
maintaining model accuracy while promoting efficiency, but aggressive pruning
significantly compromises performance, especially in bigger models. Our
findings pinpoint key strategies to construct scalable and fair multilingual
NLP solutions and underscore the need for interventions to address
hallucination and generalization errors in the low-resource setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有表格到文本生成方法主要关注客观描述，而缺乏对主观性文本的探索。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用三阶段流水线：1) 提取RDF三元组；2) 聚合文本为连贯叙述；3) 注入主观性。使用小型T5模型而非大型语言模型。

Result: 在多项指标上表现优于Mistral-7B和Llama-2，与GPT-3.5相当，平衡了事实准确性与主观解释。

Conclusion: 本文首次提出了一种结合中间表示的结构化流水线，显著提升了表格到文本生成的事实正确性和主观性。

Abstract: In Table-to-Text (T2T) generation, existing approaches predominantly focus on
providing objective descriptions of tabular data. However, generating text that
incorporates subjectivity, where subjectivity refers to interpretations beyond
raw numerical data, remains underexplored. To address this, we introduce a
novel pipeline that leverages intermediate representations to generate both
objective and subjective text from tables. Our three-stage pipeline consists
of: 1) extraction of Resource Description Framework (RDF) triples, 2)
aggregation of text into coherent narratives, and 3) infusion of subjectivity
to enrich the generated text. By incorporating RDFs, our approach enhances
factual accuracy while maintaining interpretability. Unlike large language
models (LLMs) such as GPT-3.5, Mistral-7B, and Llama-2, our pipeline employs
smaller, fine-tuned T5 models while achieving comparable performance to GPT-3.5
and outperforming Mistral-7B and Llama-2 in several metrics. We evaluate our
approach through quantitative and qualitative analyses, demonstrating its
effectiveness in balancing factual accuracy with subjective interpretation. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose a structured
pipeline for T2T generation that integrates intermediate representations to
enhance both factual correctness and subjectivity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）需要高计算资源，限制了其实际部署。现有的蒸馏技术（如知识蒸馏或任务蒸馏）忽略了小型模型在通用文本上的基本阅读教育。

Method: 提出基本阅读蒸馏（BRD），教育小型模型模仿LLM的基本阅读行为（如命名实体识别、提问和回答），然后将其应用于多种任务。

Result: 小型模型在语言推理基准和BIG-bench任务中表现优于或接近20倍大的LLM。BRD能有效影响小型模型的概率分布，并与知识蒸馏或任务蒸馏正交。

Conclusion: BRD是一种有效的蒸馏方法，通过教育小型模型模仿LLM的基本阅读行为，显著提升了其性能，且与其他蒸馏方法互补。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities in
various natural language processing areas, but they demand high computation
resources which limits their deployment in real-world. Distillation is one
technique to solve this problem through either knowledge distillation or task
distillation. Both distillation approaches train small models to imitate
specific features of LLMs, but they all neglect basic reading education for
small models on generic texts that are \emph{unrelated} to downstream tasks. In
this paper, we propose basic reading distillation (BRD) which educates a small
model to imitate LLMs basic reading behaviors, such as named entity
recognition, question raising and answering, on each sentence. After such basic
education, we apply the small model on various tasks including language
inference benchmarks and BIG-bench tasks. It shows that the small model can
outperform or perform comparable to over 20x bigger LLMs. Analysis reveals that
BRD effectively influences the probability distribution of the small model, and
has orthogonality to either knowledge distillation or task distillation.

Conclusion: JT-Math-8B通过系统性优化和高质量数据，显著提升了数学推理能力，为开源模型树立了新标杆。

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning is a cornerstone of artificial general intelligence
and a primary benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs). While state-of-the-art models show promise, they often falter
when faced with complex problems that demand deep conceptual understanding and
intricate, multi-step deliberation. To address this challenge, we introduce
JT-Math-8B, a series of open-source models comprising base, instruct, and
thinking versions, built upon a systematic, multi-stage optimization framework.
Our pre-training corpus is a high-quality, 210B-token dataset curated through a
dedicated data pipeline that uses model-based validation to ensure quality and
diversity. The Instruct Model is optimized for direct, concise answers through
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and a GRPO-based reinforcement learning (RL)
method. The Thinking Model is trained for complex problem-solving using a Long
Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) approach, combining SFT with a novel, multi-stage
RL curriculum that progressively increases task difficulty and context length
up to 32K tokens. JT-Math-8B achieves state-of-the-art results among
open-source models of similar size, surpassing prominent models like OpenAI's
O1-mini and GPT-4o , and demonstrating superior performance on
competition-level mathematics.

Motivation: 研究基督教小说的文化及文学层面，填补学术空白，特别是对神迹描写的分析。

Method: 结合人类注释与轻量级语言模型，开发神迹定义及标注手册，并进行文本分析。

Result: 轻量级模型能匹配人类注释，揭示《末日迷踪》与其他作品及男女作者间的显著差异。

Conclusion: 计算工具能有效分析基督教小说，揭示其多样性与作者性别差异。

Abstract: In addition to its more widely studied political activities, the American
Evangelical movement has a well-developed but less externally visible cultural
and literary side. Christian Fiction, however, has been little studied, and
what scholarly attention there is has focused on the explosively popular Left
Behind series. In this work, we use computational tools to provide both a broad
topical overview of Christian Fiction as a genre and a more directed
exploration of how its authors depict divine acts. Working with human
annotators we first developed definitions and a codebook for "acts of God." We
then adapted those instructions designed for human annotators for use by a
recent, lightweight LM with the assistance of a much larger model. The
laptop-scale LM is capable of matching human annotations, even when the task is
subtle and challenging. Using these annotations, we show that significant and
meaningful differences exist between the Left Behind books and Christian
Fiction more broadly and between books by male and female authors.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种超长输出强化学习（UloRL）方法，通过分段解码和动态掩码技术，解决了传统强化学习在超长输出序列中的低效问题，显著提升了模型训练速度和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习框架在处理超长输出序列时效率低下，存在长尾分布和熵崩溃问题，限制了大型语言模型的推理能力提升。

Method: 将超长输出解码分为短段进行训练，并引入动态掩码技术（MPTs）以防止熵崩溃。

Result: 在Qwen3-30B-A3B模型上，训练速度提升2.06倍，性能在AIME2025和BeyondAIME任务中分别从70.9%提升至85.1%和50.7%提升至61.9%。

Conclusion: UloRL方法有效提升了大型语言模型在超长序列生成中的推理能力，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have highlighted the
potential of reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) to enhance
reasoning capabilities through extended output sequences. However, traditional
RL frameworks face inefficiencies when handling ultra-long outputs due to
long-tail sequence distributions and entropy collapse during training. To
address these challenges, we propose an Ultra-Long Output Reinforcement
Learning (UloRL) approach for advancing large language models' reasoning
abilities. Specifically, we divide ultra long output decoding into short
segments, enabling efficient training by mitigating delays caused by long-tail
samples. Additionally, we introduce dynamic masking of well-Mastered Positive
Tokens (MPTs) to prevent entropy collapse. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach. On the Qwen3-30B-A3B model, RL with segment
rollout achieved 2.06x increase in training speed, while RL training with
128k-token outputs improves the model's performance on AIME2025 from 70.9\% to
85.1\% and on BeyondAIME from 50.7\% to 61.9\%, even surpassing Qwen3-235B-A22B
with remarkable gains. These findings underscore the potential of our methods
to advance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs with ultra-long sequence
generation. We will release our code and model for further use by the
community.

Motivation: 当前LLMs处理长上下文面临稀有长文本、高计算成本和短上下文能力遗忘等问题，现有方法依赖LLMs或人工，成本高且长度和多样性有限。

Method: Flora通过基于类别的短指令组合和长上下文元指令指导LLMs生成响应，实现任意长度和多样性的上下文构建。

Result: 实验表明，Flora增强的LLMs在三个长上下文基准测试中表现优异，同时保持短上下文任务的强性能。

Conclusion: Flora提供了一种高效、低成本的长上下文构建方法，显著提升LLMs性能且不影响短上下文能力。

Abstract: Effectively handling long contexts is challenging for Large Language Models
(LLMs) due to the rarity of long texts, high computational demands, and
substantial forgetting of short-context abilities. Recent approaches have
attempted to construct long contexts for instruction tuning, but these methods
often require LLMs or human interventions, which are both costly and limited in
length and diversity. Also, the drop in short-context performances of present
long-context LLMs remains significant. In this paper, we introduce Flora, an
effortless (human/LLM-free) long-context construction strategy. Flora can
markedly enhance the long-context performance of LLMs by arbitrarily assembling
short instructions based on categories and instructing LLMs to generate
responses based on long-context meta-instructions. This enables Flora to
produce contexts of arbitrary length and scale with rich diversity, while only
slightly compromising short-context performance. Experiments on
Llama3-8B-Instruct and QwQ-32B show that LLMs enhanced by Flora excel in three
long-context benchmarks while maintaining strong performances in short-context
tasks. Our data-construction code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长上下文输入处理中，KV缓存的内存需求巨大，现有压缩方法在内存减少超过85%时性能显著下降，且GPU-CPU协作策略未被充分探索。

Method: HCAttention结合键量化、值卸载和动态KV淘汰，兼容现有Transformer架构，无需微调。

Result: 在LongBench基准测试中，HCAttention在KV缓存内存占用缩小至25%时保持全注意力模型的准确性，甚至在12.5%缓存下仍具竞争力。

Conclusion: HCAttention在LLM KV缓存压缩领域达到新SOTA，首次实现Llama-3-8B模型在单块A100 GPU上处理400万token。

Abstract: Processing long-context inputs with large language models presents a
significant challenge due to the enormous memory requirements of the Key-Value
(KV) cache during inference. Existing KV cache compression methods exhibit
noticeable performance degradation when memory is reduced by more than 85%.
Additionally, strategies that leverage GPU-CPU collaboration for approximate
attention remain underexplored in this setting. We propose HCAttention, a
heterogeneous attention computation framework that integrates key quantization,
value offloading, and dynamic KV eviction to enable efficient inference under
extreme memory constraints. The method is compatible with existing transformer
architectures and does not require model fine-tuning. Experimental results on
the LongBench benchmark demonstrate that our approach preserves the accuracy of
full-attention model while shrinking the KV cache memory footprint to 25% of
its original size. Remarkably, it stays competitive with only 12.5% of the
cache, setting a new state-of-the-art in LLM KV cache compression. To the best
of our knowledge, HCAttention is the first to extend the Llama-3-8B model to
process 4 million tokens on a single A100 GPU with 80GB memory.

Result: DiscoDrive在训练和低资源数据增强场景中均表现优异，显著提升了BLEU-4、METEOR等指标，并在人类评估中优于现有数据集。

Conclusion: DiscoDrive填补了现有资源的空白，为训练和增强对话AI提供了多功能语料库，提升了处理真实不流畅对话的能力。

Abstract: In-car conversational AI is becoming increasingly critical as autonomous
vehicles and smart assistants gain widespread adoption. Yet, existing datasets
fail to capture the spontaneous disfluencies such as hesitations, false starts,
repetitions, and self-corrections that characterize real driver-AI dialogs. To
address this, we introduce DiscoDrive, a synthetic corpus of 3500 multi-turn
dialogs across seven automotive domains, generated using a two-stage,
prompt-driven pipeline that dynamically integrates disfluencies during
synthesis. We show that DiscoDrive is effective both as a training resource,
enabling DialoGPT-Medium and T5-Base to match or exceed KVRET-trained models on
the MultiWOZ 2.2 and Schema-Guided Dialogue (SGD) relevant test sets (BLEU-4
improvements of 0.26 to 0.61; METEOR +2.10; ROUGE-L +3.48; BERTScore F1
improvements of 1.35 to 3.48), and as a data augmentation resource in
low-resource scenarios, delivering additional gains of up to BLEU-4 +0.38,
METEOR +1.95, ROUGE-L +2.87, and BERTScore F1 +4.00 when combined with 10
percent of KVRET. Human evaluations further confirm that dialogs sampled from
DiscoDrive are rated higher than KVRET's human-collected dialogs in naturalness
(3.8 vs 3.6) and coherence (4.1 vs 4.0), and are perceived as more
context-appropriate than leading post-hoc methods (such as LARD), without
compromising clarity. DiscoDrive fills a critical gap in existing resources and
serves as a versatile corpus for both training and augmenting conversational
AI, enabling robust handling of real-world, disfluent in-car interactions.

Result: 部分模型（如Claude-3.5-Sonnet和Claude-3-Opus）表现接近人类，但多模态问题和语言差异仍存在不足。

Conclusion: 需进一步优化非英语医学AI应用，强调多语言和多模态评估的重要性。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has shown the potential to revolutionize
healthcare by improving diagnostic accuracy, optimizing workflows, and
personalizing treatment plans. Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved notable advancements in natural
language processing and medical applications. However, the evaluation of these
models has focused predominantly on the English language, leading to potential
biases in their performance across different languages.
  This study investigates the capability of six LLMs (GPT-4.0 Turbo,
LLaMA-3-8B, LLaMA-3-70B, Mixtral 8x7B Instruct, Titan Text G1-Express, and
Command R+) and four MLLMs (Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Claude-3-Opus, Claude-3-Sonnet,
and Claude-3-Haiku) to answer questions written in Brazilian spoken portuguese
from the medical residency entrance exam of the Hospital das Cl\'inicas da
Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de S\~ao Paulo (HCFMUSP) - the largest
health complex in South America. The performance of the models was benchmarked
against human candidates, analyzing accuracy, processing time, and coherence of
the generated explanations.
  The results show that while some models, particularly Claude-3.5-Sonnet and
Claude-3-Opus, achieved accuracy levels comparable to human candidates,
performance gaps persist, particularly in multimodal questions requiring image
interpretation. Furthermore, the study highlights language disparities,
emphasizing the need for further fine-tuning and data set augmentation for
non-English medical AI applications.
  Our findings reinforce the importance of evaluating generative AI in various
linguistic and clinical settings to ensure a fair and reliable deployment in
healthcare. Future research should explore improved training methodologies,
improved multimodal reasoning, and real-world clinical integration of AI-driven
medical assistance.

Abstract: Early detection of depression from online social media posts holds promise
for providing timely mental health interventions. In this work, we present a
high-quality, expert-annotated dataset of 1,017 social media posts labeled with
depressive spans and mapped to 12 depression symptom categories. Unlike prior
datasets that primarily offer coarse post-level labels
\cite{cohan-etal-2018-smhd}, our dataset enables fine-grained evaluation of
both model predictions and generated explanations.
  We develop an evaluation framework that leverages this clinically grounded
dataset to assess the faithfulness and quality of natural language explanations
generated by large language models (LLMs). Through carefully designed prompting
strategies, including zero-shot and few-shot approaches with domain-adapted
examples, we evaluate state-of-the-art proprietary LLMs including GPT-4.1,
Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Claude 3.7 Sonnet.
  Our comprehensive empirical analysis reveals significant differences in how
these models perform on clinical explanation tasks, with zero-shot and few-shot
prompting. Our findings underscore the value of human expertise in guiding LLM
behavior and offer a step toward safer, more transparent AI systems for
psychological well-being.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CaliDrop的新策略，通过校准增强令牌驱逐，以减少KV缓存的内存占用，同时减轻精度损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）生成过程中需要大量计算资源，KV缓存虽加速生成但其内存占用随序列长度、批次大小和模型规模线性增长，成为长上下文场景的瓶颈。现有压缩技术（如令牌驱逐）虽能减少内存占用，但会导致精度显著下降。

Method: 提出CaliDrop策略，利用附近位置查询高度相似的观察，对丢弃的令牌进行推测性校准，以减轻令牌驱逐带来的精度损失。

Result: 实验表明，CaliDrop显著提升了现有令牌驱逐方法的精度。

Conclusion: CaliDrop通过校准增强令牌驱逐，有效解决了KV缓存内存占用与精度损失之间的矛盾。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require substantial computational resources
during generation. While the Key-Value (KV) cache significantly accelerates
this process by storing attention intermediates, its memory footprint grows
linearly with sequence length, batch size, and model size, creating a
bottleneck in long-context scenarios. Various KV cache compression techniques,
including token eviction, quantization, and low-rank projection, have been
proposed to mitigate this bottleneck, often complementing each other. This
paper focuses on enhancing token eviction strategies. Token eviction leverages
the observation that the attention patterns are often sparse, allowing for the
removal of less critical KV entries to save memory. However, this reduction
usually comes at the cost of notable accuracy degradation, particularly under
high compression ratios. To address this issue, we propose \textbf{CaliDrop}, a
novel strategy that enhances token eviction through calibration. Our
preliminary experiments show that queries at nearby positions exhibit high
similarity. Building on this observation, CaliDrop performs speculative
calibration on the discarded tokens to mitigate the accuracy loss caused by
token eviction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CaliDrop significantly
improves the accuracy of existing token eviction methods.

TL;DR: KLAAD是一种基于注意力的去偏框架，通过隐式对齐注意力分布减少LLMs中的社会偏见，同时保持语言质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs输出中的社会偏见问题，避免直接修改模型权重。

Method: 提出KLAAD框架，结合交叉熵、KL散度和Triplet损失，对齐注意力分布。

Result: 在BBQ和BOLD基准测试中有效减少偏见，且对语言建模质量影响小。

Conclusion: 注意力对齐为生成语言模型的偏见缓解提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit societal biases in their outputs,
prompting ethical concerns regarding fairness and harm. In this work, we
propose KLAAD (KL-Attention Alignment Debiasing), an attention-based debiasing
framework that implicitly aligns attention distributions between stereotypical
and anti-stereotypical sentence pairs without directly modifying model weights.
KLAAD introduces a composite training objective combining Cross-Entropy, KL
divergence, and Triplet losses, guiding the model to consistently attend across
biased and unbiased contexts while preserving fluency and coherence.
Experimental evaluation of KLAAD demonstrates improved bias mitigation on both
the BBQ and BOLD benchmarks, with minimal impact on language modeling quality.
The results indicate that attention-level alignment offers a principled
solution for mitigating bias in generative language models.

TL;DR: Text2Vis是一个用于评估文本到可视化模型的基准，涵盖20多种图表类型和多样化数据科学查询，包含1,985个样本。通过评估11种开源和闭源模型，揭示了性能差距，并提出了一种跨模态的actor-critic框架以提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏全面评估大型语言模型（LLMs）生成可视化能力的基准，限制了对其能力的严格评估。

Method: 引入Text2Vis基准，包含数据表、自然语言查询、可视化代码等样本。提出跨模态actor-critic框架，联合优化文本答案和可视化代码。

Abstract: Automated data visualization plays a crucial role in simplifying data
interpretation, enhancing decision-making, and improving efficiency. While
large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating visualizations
from natural language, the absence of comprehensive benchmarks limits the
rigorous evaluation of their capabilities. We introduce Text2Vis, a benchmark
designed to assess text-to-visualization models, covering 20+ chart types and
diverse data science queries, including trend analysis, correlation, outlier
detection, and predictive analytics. It comprises 1,985 samples, each with a
data table, natural language query, short answer, visualization code, and
annotated charts. The queries involve complex reasoning, conversational turns,
and dynamic data retrieval. We benchmark 11 open-source and closed-source
models, revealing significant performance gaps, highlighting key challenges,
and offering insights for future advancements. To close this gap, we propose
the first cross-modal actor-critic agentic framework that jointly refines the
textual answer and visualization code, increasing GPT-4o`s pass rate from 26%
to 42% over the direct approach and improving chart quality. We also introduce
an automated LLM-based evaluation framework that enables scalable assessment
across thousands of samples without human annotation, measuring answer
correctness, code execution success, visualization readability, and chart
accuracy. We release Text2Vis at https://github.com/vis-nlp/Text2Vis.

Motivation: 探讨LLMs在写作评分中的可靠性，并与人类评分者比较，以支持大规模写作评估的混合评分模型。

Method: 使用概化理论，比较人类和AI评分者在故事叙述和邮件回复任务中的评分一致性，由两名人类评分者和七名AI评分者独立评分。

Result: 人类评分者整体更可靠，但LLMs在故事叙述任务中表现合理，混合评分模型提高了可靠性。

Conclusion: 混合评分模型可能有益于大规模写作评估，LLMs在特定条件下可作为补充工具。

Abstract: This study investigates the estimation of reliability for large language
models (LLMs) in scoring writing tasks from the AP Chinese Language and Culture
Exam. Using generalizability theory, the research evaluates and compares score
consistency between human and AI raters across two types of AP Chinese
free-response writing tasks: story narration and email response. These essays
were independently scored by two trained human raters and seven AI raters. Each
essay received four scores: one holistic score and three analytic scores
corresponding to the domains of task completion, delivery, and language use.
Results indicate that although human raters produced more reliable scores
overall, LLMs demonstrated reasonable consistency under certain conditions,
particularly for story narration tasks. Composite scoring that incorporates
both human and AI raters improved reliability, which supports that hybrid
scoring models may offer benefits for large-scale writing assessments.

Result: VLQA数据集为越南法律领域提供了高质量资源，实验验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: VLQA填补了低资源语言法律NLP的空白，为未来研究提供了重要基础。

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has led to significant
achievements in various domains, including legal text processing. Leveraging
LLMs for legal tasks is a natural evolution and an increasingly compelling
choice. However, their capabilities are often portrayed as greater than they
truly are. Despite the progress, we are still far from the ultimate goal of
fully automating legal tasks using artificial intelligence (AI) and natural
language processing (NLP). Moreover, legal systems are deeply domain-specific
and exhibit substantial variation across different countries and languages. The
need for building legal text processing applications for different natural
languages is, therefore, large and urgent. However, there is a big challenge
for legal NLP in low-resource languages such as Vietnamese due to the scarcity
of resources and annotated data. The need for labeled legal corpora for
supervised training, validation, and supervised fine-tuning is critical. In
this paper, we introduce the VLQA dataset, a comprehensive and high-quality
resource tailored for the Vietnamese legal domain. We also conduct a
comprehensive statistical analysis of the dataset and evaluate its
effectiveness through experiments with state-of-the-art models on legal
information retrieval and question-answering tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言异常（如垃圾信息、假新闻和仇恨言论）因其稀疏性和多样性而难以检测，尤其是在标注数据有限的情况下。

Method: 将异常检测视为少样本二分类问题，利用元学习训练跨任务泛化模型，结合情景训练、原型网络和领域重采样。

Result: 在多个数据集上评估，模型在F1和AUC分数上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在少样本文本异常检测中表现优异，并公开了代码和基准以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: We propose a meta learning framework for detecting anomalies in human
language across diverse domains with limited labeled data. Anomalies in
language ranging from spam and fake news to hate speech pose a major challenge
due to their sparsity and variability. We treat anomaly detection as a few shot
binary classification problem and leverage meta-learning to train models that
generalize across tasks. Using datasets from domains such as SMS spam, COVID-19
fake news, and hate speech, we evaluate model generalization on unseen tasks
with minimal labeled anomalies. Our method combines episodic training with
prototypical networks and domain resampling to adapt quickly to new anomaly
detection tasks. Empirical results show that our method outperforms strong
baselines in F1 and AUC scores. We also release the code and benchmarks to
facilitate further research in few-shot text anomaly detection.

TL;DR: FAEDKV是一种无需训练的KV缓存压缩框架，通过频域转换实现无偏信息保留，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在长上下文任务中KV缓存的高内存和计算需求问题，避免现有压缩方法导致的偏置表示。

Method: 使用无限窗口傅里叶变换（IWDFT）将KV缓存转换到频域，实现均衡信息保留。

Result: 在LongBench基准测试中优于现有方法22%，在Needle-In-A-Haystack任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: FAEDKV提供了一种高效、无偏的KV缓存压缩方案，适用于长上下文任务。

Abstract: The efficacy of Large Language Models (LLMs) in long-context tasks is often
hampered by the substantial memory footprint and computational demands of the
Key-Value (KV) cache. Current compression strategies, including token eviction
and learned projections, frequently lead to biased representations -- either by
overemphasizing recent/high-attention tokens or by repeatedly degrading
information from earlier context -- and may require costly model retraining. We
present FAEDKV (Frequency-Adaptive Infinite-Window for KV cache), a novel,
training-free KV cache compression framework that ensures unbiased information
retention. FAEDKV operates by transforming the KV cache into the frequency
domain using a proposed Infinite-Window Fourier Transform (IWDFT). This
approach allows for the equalized contribution of all tokens to the compressed
representation, effectively preserving both early and recent contextual
information. A preliminary frequency ablation study identifies critical
spectral components for layer-wise, targeted compression. Experiments on
LongBench benchmark demonstrate FAEDKV's superiority over existing methods by
up to 22\%. In addition, our method shows superior, position-agnostic retrieval
accuracy on the Needle-In-A-Haystack task compared to compression based
approaches.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种生成复杂统计信息图的方法，填补了现有AI技术仅能生成简单图表的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI技术（如LLMs）只能生成简单图表，无法从文本密集文档中生成复杂信息图。

Method: 提出Infogen框架，分两阶段：微调LLMs生成元数据，再转换为信息图代码。

Result: Infogen在Infodat基准测试中表现优于其他LLMs。

Conclusion: Infogen在生成统计信息图方面达到领先水平。

Abstract: Statistical infographics are powerful tools that simplify complex data into
visually engaging and easy-to-understand formats. Despite advancements in AI,
particularly with LLMs, existing efforts have been limited to generating simple
charts, with no prior work addressing the creation of complex infographics from
text-heavy documents that demand a deep understanding of the content. We
address this gap by introducing the task of generating statistical infographics
composed of multiple sub-charts (e.g., line, bar, pie) that are contextually
accurate, insightful, and visually aligned. To achieve this, we define
infographic metadata that includes its title and textual insights, along with
sub-chart-specific details such as their corresponding data and alignment. We
also present Infodat, the first benchmark dataset for text-to-infographic
metadata generation, where each sample links a document to its metadata. We
propose Infogen, a two-stage framework where fine-tuned LLMs first generate
metadata, which is then converted into infographic code. Extensive evaluations
on Infodat demonstrate that Infogen achieves state-of-the-art performance,
outperforming both closed and open-source LLMs in text-to-statistical
infographic generation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种编译器框架，用于将DNN验证器的神经元级规范自动转换为基于张量的层级实现，解决了设计与实现之间的语义鸿沟问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于DNN的不透明性，基于抽象解释的验证成为建立信任的实用方法，但目前验证器的开发与修改困难，设计与实现之间存在语义鸿沟。

Method: 提出了一种编译器框架，包括基于堆栈的中间表示（IR）和形状分析，支持自动转换和优化，并引入g-BCSR格式处理稀疏性。

Result: 编译器实现了与手工优化相当的性能，同时支持灵活开发新验证器。

Conclusion: 该框架降低了开发DNN验证器的复杂性，提升了实用性和性能。

Abstract: The uninterpretability of DNNs has led to the adoption of abstract
interpretation-based certification as a practical means to establish trust in
real-world systems that rely on DNNs. However, the current landscape supports
only a limited set of certifiers, and developing new ones or modifying existing
ones for different applications remains difficult. This is because the
mathematical design of certifiers is expressed at the neuron level, while their
implementations are optimized and executed at the tensor level. This mismatch
creates a semantic gap between design and implementation, making manual
bridging both complex and expertise-intensive -- requiring deep knowledge in
formal methods, high-performance computing, etc.
  We propose a compiler framework that automatically translates neuron-level
specifications of DNN certifiers into tensor-based, layer-level
implementations. This is enabled by two key innovations: a novel stack-based
intermediate representation (IR) and a shape analysis that infers the implicit
tensor operations needed to simulate the neuron-level semantics. During
lifting, the shape analysis creates tensors in the minimal shape required to
perform the corresponding operations. The IR also enables domain-specific
optimizations as rewrites. At runtime, the resulting tensor computations
exhibit sparsity tied to the DNN architecture. This sparsity does not align
well with existing formats. To address this, we introduce g-BCSR, a
double-compression format that represents tensors as collections of blocks of
varying sizes, each possibly internally sparse.
  Using our compiler and g-BCSR, we make it easy to develop new certifiers and
analyze their utility across diverse DNNs. Despite its flexibility, the
compiler achieves performance comparable to hand-optimized implementations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索RAG在多样化检索场景中的实际效果，填补其在真实世界应用中的研究空白。

Method: 使用大规模混合知识数据存储MassiveDS评估RAG系统。

Result: 检索对小模型更有效，重排器作用有限，且LLMs难以处理异构知识源。

Conclusion: 需开发自适应检索策略以优化RAG在真实场景中的应用。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
integrating external knowledge retrieved at inference time. While RAG
demonstrates strong performance on benchmarks largely derived from
general-domain corpora like Wikipedia, its effectiveness under realistic,
diverse retrieval scenarios remains underexplored. We evaluated RAG systems
using MassiveDS, a large-scale datastore with mixture of knowledge, and
identified critical limitations: retrieval mainly benefits smaller models,
rerankers add minimal value, and no single retrieval source consistently
excels. Moreover, current LLMs struggle to route queries across heterogeneous
knowledge sources. These findings highlight the need for adaptive retrieval
strategies before deploying RAG in real-world settings. Our code and data can

TL;DR: 论文提出ProsodyLM，通过改进语音标记化方案，使语言模型能更好地学习和处理韵律信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音语言模型在训练时通常将语音转换为离散标记，但这种方法在捕捉内容与韵律的复杂依赖关系上效果不佳。

Method: 提出ProsodyLM，采用一种新的标记化方案：先将语音转录为文本，再生成词级韵律标记，以保留更完整的韵律信息。

Result: ProsodyLM仅通过预训练就能学习到多样化的韵律处理能力，包括生成语音中的韵律细节、理解情感和重音，以及保持长上下文中的韵律一致性。

Conclusion: ProsodyLM通过改进标记化方案，显著提升了语言模型对韵律信息的处理能力。

Abstract: Speech language models refer to language models with speech processing and
understanding capabilities. One key desirable capability for speech language
models is the ability to capture the intricate interdependency between content
and prosody. The existing mainstream paradigm of training speech language
models, which converts speech into discrete tokens before feeding them into
LLMs, is sub-optimal in learning prosody information -- we find that the
resulting LLMs do not exhibit obvious emerging prosody processing capabilities
via pre-training alone. To overcome this, we propose ProsodyLM, which
introduces a simple tokenization scheme amenable to learning prosody. Each
speech utterance is first transcribed into text, followed by a sequence of
word-level prosody tokens. Compared with conventional speech tokenization
schemes, the proposed tokenization scheme retains more complete prosody
information, and is more understandable to text-based LLMs. We find that
ProsodyLM can learn surprisingly diverse emerging prosody processing
capabilities through pre-training alone, ranging from harnessing the prosody
nuances in generated speech, such as contrastive focus, understanding emotion
and stress in an utterance, to maintaining prosody consistency in long
contexts.

Abstract: Preserving ancient languages is essential for understanding humanity's

under-resourced, limiting its accessibility to modern natural language

large language models (LLMs) to generate high-quality Old English texts,
addressing this gap. Our approach combines parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(Low-Rank Adaptation, LoRA), data augmentation via backtranslation, and a
dual-agent pipeline that separates the tasks of content generation (in English)
and translation (into Old English). Evaluation with automated metrics (BLEU,
METEOR, and CHRF) shows significant improvements over baseline models, with
BLEU scores increasing from 26 to over 65 for English-to-Old English
translation. Expert human assessment also confirms high grammatical accuracy
and stylistic fidelity in the generated texts. Beyond expanding the Old English
corpus, our method offers a practical blueprint for revitalizing other
endangered languages, effectively uniting AI innovation with the goals of

Motivation: 解决DPO在自动提示工程中因缺乏语义一致性检查而导致提示偏离用户意图的问题。

Method: 引入Sem-DPO，通过余弦距离加权DPO损失，确保提示优化时语义一致性。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Sem-DPO比DPO提升8-12%的CLIP相似度和5-9%的人类偏好分数。

Conclusion: 语义加权的强基线方法应成为提示优化的新标准，并为语言模型的语义感知偏好优化奠定基础。

Abstract: Generative AI can now synthesize strikingly realistic images from text, yet
output quality remains highly sensitive to how prompts are phrased. Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) offers a lightweight, off-policy alternative to
RL for automatic prompt engineering, but its token-level regularization leaves
semantic inconsistency unchecked as prompts that win higher preference scores
can still drift away from the user's intended meaning.
  We introduce Sem-DPO, a variant of DPO that preserves semantic consistency
yet retains its simplicity and efficiency. Sem-DPO scales the DPO loss by an
exponential weight proportional to the cosine distance between the original
prompt and winning candidate in embedding space, softly down-weighting training
signals that would otherwise reward semantically mismatched prompts. We provide
the first analytical bound on semantic drift for preference-tuned prompt
generators, showing that Sem-DPO keeps learned prompts within a provably
bounded neighborhood of the original text. On three standard text-to-image
prompt-optimization benchmarks and two language models, Sem-DPO achieves 8-12%
higher CLIP similarity and 5-9% higher human-preference scores (HPSv2.1,
PickScore) than DPO, while also outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. These
findings suggest that strong flat baselines augmented with semantic weighting
should become the new standard for prompt-optimization studies and lay the
groundwork for broader, semantics-aware preference optimization in language
models.

Abstract: This paper presents the technical solution developed by team CRUISE for the
KDD Cup 2025 Meta Comprehensive RAG Benchmark for Multi-modal, Multi-turn
(CRAG-MM) challenge. The challenge aims to address a critical limitation of
modern Vision Language Models (VLMs): their propensity to hallucinate,
especially when faced with egocentric imagery, long-tail entities, and complex,
multi-hop questions. This issue is particularly problematic in real-world
applications where users pose fact-seeking queries that demand high factual
accuracy across diverse modalities. To tackle this, we propose a robust,
multi-stage framework that prioritizes factual accuracy and truthfulness over
completeness. Our solution integrates a lightweight query router for
efficiency, a query-aware retrieval and summarization pipeline, a dual-pathways
generation and a post-hoc verification. This conservative strategy is designed
to minimize hallucinations, which incur a severe penalty in the competition's
scoring metric. Our approach achieved 3rd place in Task 1, demonstrating the
effectiveness of prioritizing answer reliability in complex multi-modal RAG
systems. Our implementation is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长上下文场景下的文档理解（DU）在复杂布局中仍是一个重大挑战，现有大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在长上下文任务中表现不佳，且缺乏细粒度训练数据。

Method: 采用多代理交互框架，自动生成长上下文问题，涵盖英语和阿拉伯语的长文档。

Result: 生成的英语和阿拉伯语问题（AraEngLongBench）对主流LVLMs具有挑战性。

Conclusion: 该方法为提升LVLMs的长上下文理解能力提供了高效的数据生成方案。

Abstract: Document Understanding (DU) in long-contextual scenarios with complex layouts
remains a significant challenge in vision-language research. Although Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) excel at short-context DU tasks, their
performance declines in long-context settings. A key limitation is the scarcity
of fine-grained training data, particularly for low-resource languages such as
Arabic. Existing state-of-the-art techniques rely heavily on human annotation,
which is costly and inefficient. We propose a fully automated, multi-agent
interactive framework to generate long-context questions efficiently. Our

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为UGST的新框架，用于跟踪多轮对话中用户目标的进展，并展示了其在提升目标对齐用户模拟器性能方面的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型（LLMs）在多轮对话中难以保持目标导向行为，限制了其在对话AI中的可靠性。

Method: 引入用户目标状态跟踪（UGST）框架，提出三阶段方法开发能自主跟踪目标进展并生成目标对齐响应的用户模拟器。

Result: 在MultiWOZ 2.4和{\tau}-Bench两个基准测试中，该方法显著提升了目标对齐性能。

Conclusion: UGST填补了对话AI中的关键空白，成为开发目标对齐用户模拟器的重要框架。

Abstract: User simulators are essential to conversational AI, enabling scalable agent
development and evaluation through simulated interactions. While current Large
Language Models (LLMs) have advanced user simulation capabilities, we reveal
that they struggle to consistently demonstrate goal-oriented behavior across
multi-turn conversations--a critical limitation that compromises their
reliability in downstream applications. We introduce User Goal State Tracking
(UGST), a novel framework that tracks user goal progression throughout
conversations. Leveraging UGST, we present a three-stage methodology for
developing user simulators that can autonomously track goal progression and
reason to generate goal-aligned responses. Moreover, we establish comprehensive
evaluation metrics for measuring goal alignment in user simulators, and
demonstrate that our approach yields substantial improvements across two
benchmarks (MultiWOZ 2.4 and {\tau}-Bench). Our contributions address a
critical gap in conversational AI and establish UGST as an essential framework
for developing goal-aligned user simulators.

TL;DR: SGPO是一种基于自我改进机制的对齐框架，通过自我生成偏好数据优化模型，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统对齐方法依赖人工标注数据导致的分布偏移问题。

Method: 提出SGPO框架，利用自我改进机制生成偏好数据，直接优化策略模型。

Result: 在AlpacaEval 2.0和Arena-Hard上显著优于DPO和基线方法。

Conclusion: SGPO无需外部偏好数据即可实现高效对齐，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), despite their extensive pretraining on diverse
datasets, require effective alignment to human preferences for practical and
reliable deployment. Conventional alignment methods typically employ off-policy
learning and depend on human-annotated datasets, which limits their broad
applicability and introduces distribution shift issues during training. To
address these challenges, we propose Self-Generated Preference Optimization
based on Self-Improver (SGPO), an innovative alignment framework that leverages
an on-policy self-improving mechanism. Specifically, the improver refines
responses from a policy model to self-generate preference data for direct
preference optimization (DPO) of the policy model. Here, the improver and
policy are unified into a single model, and in order to generate higher-quality
preference data, this self-improver learns to make incremental yet discernible
improvements to the current responses by referencing supervised fine-tuning
outputs. Experimental results on AlpacaEval 2.0 and Arena-Hard show that the
proposed SGPO significantly improves performance over DPO and baseline
self-improving methods without using external preference data.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种意图树的概念和数据集构建流程，创建了多模态基准SessionIntentBench，用于评估模型在理解会话间意图转移的能力。实验表明现有模型难以捕捉复杂会话中的意图，但注入意图能提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未能有效捕捉和建模用户意图，主要因为信息利用不足且仅依赖表面信息（如描述和标题）。此外，缺乏明确建模意图的数据和基准。

Method: 引入意图树概念，提出数据集构建流程，创建多模态基准SessionIntentBench，包含四个子任务。通过大规模数据挖掘和人工标注形成评估集。

Result: 构建了包含1,952,177意图条目和1,132,145会话意图轨迹的数据集。实验证实现有模型难以捕捉复杂会话意图，但意图注入能提升模型性能。

Conclusion: 论文提出的意图树和数据集填补了意图建模的空白，为未来研究提供了基准和方向。

Abstract: Session history is a common way of recording user interacting behaviors
throughout a browsing activity with multiple products. For example, if an user
clicks a product webpage and then leaves, it might because there are certain
features that don't satisfy the user, which serve as an important indicator of
on-the-spot user preferences. However, all prior works fail to capture and
model customer intention effectively because insufficient information
exploitation and only apparent information like descriptions and titles are
used. There is also a lack of data and corresponding benchmark for explicitly
modeling intention in E-commerce product purchase sessions. To address these
issues, we introduce the concept of an intention tree and propose a dataset
curation pipeline. Together, we construct a sibling multimodal benchmark,
SessionIntentBench, that evaluates L(V)LMs' capability on understanding
inter-session intention shift with four subtasks. With 1,952,177 intention
entries, 1,132,145 session intention trajectories, and 13,003,664 available
tasks mined using 10,905 sessions, we provide a scalable way to exploit the
existing session data for customer intention understanding. We conduct human
annotations to collect ground-truth label for a subset of collected data to
form an evaluation gold set. Extensive experiments on the annotated data
further confirm that current L(V)LMs fail to capture and utilize the intention
across the complex session setting. Further analysis show injecting intention
enhances LLMs' performances.

TL;DR: MultiRole-R1框架通过多角色视角增强推理多样性，提升主观和客观任务的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型推理模型在主观问题上表现受限，因依赖单一视角。研究发现增加角色视角能提升性能。

Method: 提出MultiRole-R1框架，包含无监督数据生成管道和基于GRPO的强化学习，奖励多样性。

Result: 实验表明MultiRole-R1在六个基准测试中有效提升推理多样性和准确性。

Conclusion: 多样性增强训练在大型推理模型中具有潜力，尤其适用于主观问题。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRM) with long chain-of-thought (CoT) capabilities
have shown strong performance on objective tasks, such as math reasoning and
coding. However, their effectiveness on subjective questions that may have
different responses from different perspectives is still limited by a tendency
towards homogeneous reasoning, introduced by the reliance on a single ground
truth in supervised fine-tuning and verifiable reward in reinforcement
learning. Motivated by the finding that increasing role perspectives
consistently improves performance, we propose MultiRole-R1, a
diversity-enhanced framework with multiple role perspectives, to improve the
accuracy and diversity in subjective reasoning tasks. MultiRole-R1 features an
unsupervised data construction pipeline that generates reasoning chains that
incorporate diverse role perspectives. We further employ reinforcement learning
via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with reward shaping, by taking
diversity as a reward signal in addition to the verifiable reward. With
specially designed reward functions, we successfully promote perspective
diversity and lexical diversity, uncovering a positive relation between
reasoning diversity and accuracy. Our experiment on six benchmarks demonstrates
MultiRole-R1's effectiveness and generalizability in enhancing both subjective
and objective reasoning, showcasing the potential of diversity-enhanced
training in LRMs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的评估范式，通过因子分析识别潜在技能，以更全面地评估大型语言模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对大型语言模型的评估依赖基准测试分数，但难以解释这些分数如何反映模型的整体能力，且缺乏对任务之间关系的理解。

Method: 使用因子分析识别跨基准测试的潜在技能，并应用于包含60个模型和44个任务的新排行榜。

Result: 识别出一小部分潜在技能，这些技能能大部分解释模型性能。

Conclusion: 研究结果转化为实用工具，可识别冗余任务、辅助模型选择，并分析模型的潜在技能。

Abstract: Current evaluations of large language models (LLMs) rely on benchmark scores,
but it is difficult to interpret what these individual scores reveal about a
model's overall skills. Specifically, as a community we lack understanding of
how tasks relate to one another, what they measure in common, how they differ,
or which ones are redundant. As a result, models are often assessed via a
single score averaged across benchmarks, an approach that fails to capture the
models' wholistic strengths and limitations. Here, we propose a new evaluation
paradigm that uses factor analysis to identify latent skills driving
performance across benchmarks. We apply this method to a comprehensive new
leaderboard showcasing the performance of 60 LLMs on 44 tasks, and identify a
small set of latent skills that largely explain performance. Finally, we turn
these insights into practical tools that identify redundant tasks, aid in model
selection, and profile models along each latent skill.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有新闻推荐系统在建模多视角新闻表征和动态用户兴趣（短期和长期偏好）方面的不足。

Method: 整合NAML（多视角新闻建模）和LSTUR（双尺度用户建模），并采用BERT词嵌入增强语义特征提取。

Result: 在MIND-small和MIND-large基准测试中表现优于大多数现有方法。

Conclusion: 结合多视角新闻表征和双尺度用户建模能有效提升新闻推荐性能。

Abstract: News recommendation systems play a vital role in mitigating information
overload by delivering personalized news content. A central challenge is to
effectively model both multi-view news representations and the dynamic nature
of user interests, which often span both short- and long-term preferences.
Existing methods typically rely on single-view features of news articles (e.g.,
titles or categories) or fail to comprehensively capture user preferences
across time scales. In this work, we propose Co-NAML-LSTUR, a hybrid news
recommendation framework that integrates NAML for attentive multi-view news
modeling and LSTUR for capturing both long- and short-term user
representations. Our model also incorporates BERT-based word embeddings to
enhance semantic feature extraction. We evaluate Co-NAML-LSTUR on two widely
used benchmarks, MIND-small and MIND-large. Experimental results show that
Co-NAML-LSTUR achieves substantial improvements over most state-of-the-art
baselines on MIND-small and MIND-large, respectively. These results demonstrate
the effectiveness of combining multi-view news representations with dual-scale
user modeling. The implementation of our model is publicly available at

Motivation: 当前大语言模型在心理健康支持中缺乏真实性和对治疗进展的捕捉，叙事疗法因访问限制和社会污名化未得到充分利用。

Method: 通过INT模拟专业叙事治疗师的行为，结合IMA评估治疗效果，量化治疗中的关键叙事转变。

Result: 实验结果显示，INT在治疗质量和深度上优于标准大语言模型，并能在社交应用中生成高质量支持对话。

Conclusion: 该框架为心理健康支持提供了更真实和有效的解决方案，推动了叙事疗法的应用。

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has opened new possibilities
for mental health support, yet current approaches lack realism in simulating
specialized psychotherapy and fail to capture therapeutic progression over
time. Narrative therapy, which helps individuals transform problematic life
stories into empowering alternatives, remains underutilized due to limited
access and social stigma. We address these limitations through a comprehensive
framework with two core components. First, INT (Interactive Narrative
Therapist) simulates expert narrative therapists by planning therapeutic
stages, guiding reflection levels, and generating contextually appropriate
expert-like responses. Second, IMA (Innovative Moment Assessment) provides a
therapy-centric evaluation method that quantifies effectiveness by tracking
"Innovative Moments" (IMs), critical narrative shifts in client speech
signaling therapy progress. Experimental results on 260 simulated clients and
230 human participants reveal that INT consistently outperforms standard LLMs
in therapeutic quality and depth. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of
INT in synthesizing high-quality support conversations to facilitate social
applications.

Motivation: 专业性在专家沟通中至关重要，但在高风险领域（如金融）中研究不足。本文旨在通过语言特征建模和评估专业性。

Method: 引入了一种新的注释框架，量化金融分析师提问中的结构和语用元素，构建了两个数据集（人类和LLM生成的问题），并训练分类器。

Result: 语言特征与人类判断和问题来源高度相关，基于这些特征的分类器优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 专业性是可学习的、领域通用的概念，可通过语言建模捕捉。

Abstract: Professionalism is a crucial yet underexplored dimension of expert
communication, particularly in high-stakes domains like finance. This paper
investigates how linguistic features can be leveraged to model and evaluate
professionalism in expert questioning. We introduce a novel annotation
framework to quantify structural and pragmatic elements in financial analyst
questions, such as discourse regulators, prefaces, and request types. Using
both human-authored and large language model (LLM)-generated questions, we
construct two datasets: one annotated for perceived professionalism and one
labeled by question origin. We show that the same linguistic features correlate
strongly with both human judgments and authorship origin, suggesting a shared
stylistic foundation. Furthermore, a classifier trained solely on these
interpretable features outperforms gemini-2.0 and SVM baselines in
distinguishing expert-authored questions. Our findings demonstrate that
professionalism is a learnable, domain-general construct that can be captured
through linguistically grounded modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语言模型训练在遇到结束标记时停止学习，忽略了完成后的潜在学习机会。

Method: 设计了白盒强化学习方法，让模型根据奖励规则评估输出内容，并通过双轨SFT优化推理和评估能力。

Result: 在不同数据集和模型上的实验表明，PCL优于传统SFT和RL方法。

Conclusion: PCL为语言模型训练提供了新的技术路径，提升了输出质量并保持了部署效率。

Abstract: Current language model training paradigms typically terminate learning upon
reaching the end-of-sequence (<eos>}) token, overlooking the potential learning
opportunities in the post-completion space. We propose Post-Completion Learning
(PCL), a novel training framework that systematically utilizes the sequence
space after model output completion, to enhance both the reasoning and
self-evaluation abilities. PCL enables models to continue generating
self-assessments and reward predictions during training, while maintaining
efficient inference by stopping at the completion point.
  To fully utilize this post-completion space, we design a white-box
reinforcement learning method: let the model evaluate the output content
according to the reward rules, then calculate and align the score with the
reward functions for supervision. We implement dual-track SFT to optimize both
reasoning and evaluation capabilities, and mixed it with RL training to achieve
multi-objective hybrid optimization.
  Experimental results on different datasets and models demonstrate consistent
improvements over traditional SFT and RL methods. Our method provides a new
technical path for language model training that enhances output quality while
preserving deployment efficiency.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种评估框架，通过分析对话中的隐含立场来提升NLP模型的包容性和公平性，避免依赖表面特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法过于依赖显性特征（如人口统计或行为属性），忽略了对话中隐含的意见表达，可能导致模型输出的偏见或刻板印象。

Method: 引入了一个基于隐含立场（stance）的评估框架，结合PU在线学习和指令调优语言模型，验证模型的规范性对齐。

Result: 框架能够揭示隐含意见的（错误）表达，为模型行为提供更包容的改进路径。

Conclusion: 通过关注隐含意见，该方法为NLP模型提供了更公平和包容的表示方式。

Abstract: Shaping inclusive representations that embrace diversity and ensure fair
participation and reflections of values is at the core of many
conversation-based models. However, many existing methods rely on surface
inclusion using mention of user demographics or behavioral attributes of social
groups. Such methods overlook the nuanced, implicit expression of opinion
embedded in conversations. Furthermore, the over-reliance on overt cues can
exacerbate misalignment and reinforce harmful or stereotypical representations
in model outputs. Thus, we took a step back and recognized that equitable
inclusion needs to account for the implicit expression of opinion and use the
stance of responses to validate the normative alignment. This study aims to
evaluate how opinions are represented in NLP or computational models by
introducing an alignment evaluation framework that foregrounds implicit, often
overlooked conversations and evaluates the normative social views and
discourse. Our approach models the stance of responses as a proxy for the
underlying opinion, enabling a considerate and reflective representation of
diverse social viewpoints. We evaluate the framework using both (i)
positive-unlabeled (PU) online learning with base classifiers, and (ii)
instruction-tuned language models to assess post-training alignment. Through
this, we provide a lens on how implicit opinions are (mis)represented and offer
a pathway toward more inclusive model behavior.

TL;DR: MoL-RL是一种新的训练范式，通过双目标优化框架将多步环境反馈信号整合到LLM中，提升推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法有效利用多步离散的环境反馈信号，导致信息丢失或未能充分利用反馈的上下文。

Method: 结合MoL持续训练（分离领域特定信号和通用语言能力）和GRPO后训练，将多步反馈蒸馏为单步推理。

Result: 在数学推理和代码生成任务中，MoL-RL表现优异，尤其在Qwen3-8B模型上达到SOTA。

Conclusion: MoL-RL为利用多步文本反馈增强LLM推理能力提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face significant challenges in effectively
leveraging sequential environmental feedback (EF) signals, such as natural
language evaluations, for feedback-independent chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning. Existing approaches either convert EF into scalar rewards, losing
rich contextual information, or employ refinement datasets, failing to exploit
the multi-step and discrete nature of EF interactions. To address these
limitations, we propose MoL-RL, a novel training paradigm that integrates
multi-step EF signals into LLMs through a dual-objective optimization
framework. Our method combines MoL (Mixture-of-Losses) continual training,
which decouples domain-specific EF signals (optimized via cross-entropy loss)
and general language capabilities (preserved via Kullback-Leibler divergence),
with GRPO-based post-training to distill sequential EF interactions into
single-step inferences. This synergy enables robust feedback-independent
reasoning without relying on external feedback loops. Experimental results on
mathematical reasoning (MATH-500, AIME24/AIME25) and code generation
(CodeAgent-Test) benchmarks demonstrate that MoL-RL achieves state-of-the-art
performance with the Qwen3-8B model, while maintaining strong generalization
across model scales (Qwen3-4B). This work provides a promising approach for
leveraging multi-step textual feedback to enhance LLMs' reasoning capabilities
in diverse domains.

Motivation: 探究多语言大语言模型（如Aya-23-8B）的内部语言处理机制，并与单语言模型（如Llama 3和Chinese-LLaMA-2）进行比较。

Method: 使用logit lens和神经元专业化分析技术，研究模型在翻译、代码混合和填空任务中的表现。

Result: 发现Aya-23在翻译时激活类型相关的语言表示，代码混合的神经元激活模式受基础语言影响更大，且语言特定神经元集中在最后几层。

Conclusion: 多语言训练显著影响LLM的内部机制，为未来的跨语言迁移研究提供了新见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at multilingual tasks, yet their internal
language processing remains poorly understood. We analyze how Aya-23-8B, a
decoder-only LLM trained on balanced multilingual data, handles code-mixed,
cloze, and translation tasks compared to predominantly monolingual models like
Llama 3 and Chinese-LLaMA-2. Using logit lens and neuron specialization
analyses, we find: (1) Aya-23 activates typologically related language
representations during translation, unlike English-centric models that rely on
a single pivot language; (2) code-mixed neuron activation patterns vary with
mixing rates and are shaped more by the base language than the mixed-in one;
and (3) Aya-23's languagespecific neurons for code-mixed inputs concentrate in
final layers, diverging from prior findings on decoder-only models. Neuron
overlap analysis further shows that script similarity and typological relations
impact processing across model types. These findings reveal how multilingual
training shapes LLM internals and inform future cross-lingual transfer
research.

Abstract: Aquaculture plays a vital role in global food security and coastal economies
by providing sustainable protein sources. As the industry expands to meet
rising demand, it faces growing challenges such as disease outbreaks,
inefficient feeding practices, rising labor costs, logistical inefficiencies,

progress, existing machine learning methods fall short of addressing the
domain-specific complexities of aquaculture. To bridge this gap, we introduce
AQUA, the first large language model (LLM) tailored for aquaculture, designed
to support farmers, researchers, and industry practitioners. Central to this
effort is AQUADAPT (Data Acquisition, Processing and Tuning), an Agentic
Framework for generating and refining high-quality synthetic data using a

Motivation: 阿拉伯方言与标准阿拉伯语的差异限制了数字服务和教育资源的普及，阻碍了阿拉伯语机器翻译的发展。

Method: 评估了六种大型语言模型的提示技术，并开发了资源高效的微调流程，包括量化技术和多方言联合训练。

Result: GPT-4o在提示技术中表现最佳，量化Gemma2-9B模型在微调中优于零样本GPT-4o，多方言联合训练提升性能10%以上。

Conclusion: 研究表明，即使在资源有限的情况下，也能实现高质量的方言翻译，为阿拉伯语NLP的包容性提供了实用方案。

Abstract: Dialectal Arabic (DA) poses a persistent challenge for natural language
processing (NLP), as most everyday communication in the Arab world occurs in
dialects that diverge significantly from Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). This
linguistic divide limits access to digital services and educational resources
and impedes progress in Arabic machine translation. This paper presents two
core contributions to advancing DA-MSA translation for the Levantine, Egyptian,
and Gulf dialects, particularly in low-resource and computationally constrained
settings: a comprehensive evaluation of training-free prompting techniques, and
the development of a resource-efficient fine-tuning pipeline. Our evaluation of
prompting strategies across six large language models (LLMs) found that
few-shot prompting consistently outperformed zero-shot, chain-of-thought, and
our proposed Ara-TEaR method. GPT-4o achieved the highest performance across
all prompting settings. For fine-tuning, a quantized Gemma2-9B model achieved a
CHrF++ score of 49.88, outperforming zero-shot GPT-4o (44.58). Joint
multi-dialect trained models outperformed single-dialect counterparts by over
10% CHrF++, and 4-bit quantization reduced memory usage by 60% with less than
1% performance loss. The results and insights of our experiments offer a
practical blueprint for improving dialectal inclusion in Arabic NLP, showing
that high-quality DA-MSA machine translation is achievable even with limited
resources and paving the way for more inclusive language technologies.

consonantal articulatory configurations. The current implementation is embedded
in a web-based application (SpeechArticulationTrainer) that includes sagittal,
glottal, and palatal views, making it suitable for use in phonetics education

*Hao Xiang,Tianyi Tang,Yang Su,Bowen Yu,An Yang,Fei Huang,Yichang Zhang,Yaojie Lu,Hongyu Lin,Xianpei Han,Jingren Zhou,Junyang Lin,Le Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RMTBench是一个用户为中心的双语角色扮演基准测试，包含80个角色和8000多轮对话，旨在更真实地评估LLMs的角色扮演能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试过于角色中心化，简化了用户与角色的互动，未能反映实际应用需求。

Method: 引入RMTBench，基于用户动机构建对话，采用多轮对话模拟机制和LLM评分。

Result: RMTBench通过关注用户意图实现，填补了学术评估与实际应用之间的差距。

Conclusion: RMTBench为评估LLMs角色扮演能力提供了更有效的框架，代码和数据集将公开。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown outstanding
potential for role-playing applications. Evaluating these capabilities is
becoming crucial yet remains challenging. Existing benchmarks mostly adopt a
\textbf{character-centric} approach, simplify user-character interactions to
isolated Q&A tasks, and fail to reflect real-world applications. To address
this limitation, we introduce RMTBench, a comprehensive \textbf{user-centric}
bilingual role-playing benchmark featuring 80 diverse characters and over 8,000
dialogue rounds. RMTBench includes custom characters with detailed backgrounds
and abstract characters defined by simple traits, enabling evaluation across
various user scenarios. Our benchmark constructs dialogues based on explicit
user motivations rather than character descriptions, ensuring alignment with
practical user applications. Furthermore, we construct an authentic multi-turn
dialogue simulation mechanism. With carefully selected evaluation dimensions
and LLM-based scoring, this mechanism captures the complex intention of
conversations between the user and the character. By shifting focus from
character background to user intention fulfillment, RMTBench bridges the gap
between academic evaluation and practical deployment requirements, offering a
more effective framework for assessing role-playing capabilities in LLMs. All
code and datasets will be released soon.

### [104] [Length Representations in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20398)
*Sangjun Moon,Dasom Choi,Jingun Kwon,Hidetaka Kamigaito,Manabu Okumura*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型（LLMs）通过多头注意力机制内部编码输出序列长度信息，且长度信息与语义信息部分解耦。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs内部如何控制输出序列长度的机制，填补这一未被研究领域的空白。

Method: 通过实证分析LLMs内部表示，特别是多头注意力机制，研究输出序列长度的编码方式。

Result: 发现特定隐藏单元的缩放可以控制输出长度而不损失信息量，且部分隐藏单元对长度敏感的提示更活跃。

Conclusion: LLMs具备无需外部控制的内部机制，能灵活调节输出长度，且长度信息与语义信息部分解耦。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across
various tasks, that are learned from massive amounts of text-based data.
Although LLMs can control output sequence length, particularly in
instruction-based settings, the internal mechanisms behind this control have
been unexplored yet. In this study, we provide empirical evidence on how output
sequence length information is encoded within the internal representations in
LLMs. In particular, our findings show that multi-head attention mechanisms are
critical in determining output sequence length, which can be adjusted in a
disentangled manner. By scaling specific hidden units within the model, we can
control the output sequence length without losing the informativeness of the
generated text, thereby indicating that length information is partially
disentangled from semantic information. Moreover, some hidden units become
increasingly active as prompts become more length-specific, thus reflecting the
model's internal awareness of this attribute. Our findings suggest that LLMs
have learned robust and adaptable internal mechanisms for controlling output
length without any external control.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CoCoT的提示策略，通过三个阶段（感知、情境和规范）提升视觉语言模型在社交任务中的表现，平均性能提升8%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统Chain-of-Thought（CoT）提示在视觉社交任务中因需同时感知、理解和判断而失效的问题。

Method: 引入Cognitive Chain-of-Thought（CoCoT），分感知、情境和规范三阶段引导模型推理。

Result: 在多个多模态基准测试中，CoCoT平均性能比CoT和直接提示高8%。

Conclusion: CoCoT通过认知分阶段推理提升了模型的解释性和社交意识，为更安全可靠的多模态系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting helps models think step by step. But what
happens when they must see, understand, and judge-all at once? In visual tasks
grounded in social context, where bridging perception with norm-grounded
judgments is essential, flat CoT often breaks down. We introduce Cognitive
Chain-of-Thought (CoCoT), a prompting strategy that scaffolds VLM reasoning
through three cognitively inspired stages: perception, situation, and norm. Our
experiments show that, across multiple multimodal benchmarks (including intent
disambiguation, commonsense reasoning, and safety), CoCoT consistently
outperforms CoT and direct prompting (+8\% on average). Our findings
demonstrate that cognitively grounded reasoning stages enhance interpretability
and social awareness in VLMs, paving the way for safer and more reliable
multimodal systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CONCAP是一种多语言图像描述模型，通过结合检索到的描述和图像特定概念，减少多语言训练需求，提升低资源语言性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多语言视觉语言模型在图像描述任务中因数据不足和参数化成本高而表现不佳的问题。

Method: 提出CONCAP模型，结合检索增强生成（RAG）和图像特定概念，减少对多语言训练数据的依赖。

Result: 在XM3600数据集上表现优异，尤其在低资源和中资源语言中，显著减少数据需求。

Conclusion: 概念感知的检索增强能有效缩小多语言性能差距。

Abstract: Multilingual vision-language models have made significant strides in image
captioning, yet they still lag behind their English counterparts due to limited
multilingual training data and costly large-scale model parameterization.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) offers a promising alternative by
conditioning caption generation on retrieved examples in the target language,
reducing the need for extensive multilingual training. However, multilingual
RAG captioning models often depend on retrieved captions translated from
English, which can introduce mismatches and linguistic biases relative to the
source language. We introduce CONCAP, a multilingual image captioning model
that integrates retrieved captions with image-specific concepts, enhancing the
contextualization of the input image and grounding the captioning process
across different languages. Experiments on the XM3600 dataset indicate that
CONCAP enables strong performance on low- and mid-resource languages, with
highly reduced data requirements. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of
concept-aware retrieval augmentation in bridging multilingual performance gaps.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文综述了英语、阿拉伯语和多语言NLU基准，重点分析了其诊断数据集和覆盖的语言现象，并提出了建立统一评估标准的必要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于NLU评估基准缺乏统一的命名规范和标准语言现象集，研究者希望通过分析现有基准的优缺点，推动建立全球语言现象层次结构。

Method: 通过详细比较和分析现有NLU基准的诊断数据集及其覆盖的语言现象，提出研究问题并支持专家构建未来标准。

Result: 研究发现现有基准在评估NLU任务和深入错误分析方面存在局限性，缺乏统一的评估标准。

Conclusion: 论文呼吁建立类似ISO的NLU诊断评估标准，以更全面地比较不同模型在诊断基准上的表现。

Abstract: Natural Language Understanding (NLU) is a basic task in Natural Language
Processing (NLP). The evaluation of NLU capabilities has become a trending
research topic that attracts researchers in the last few years, resulting in
the development of numerous benchmarks. These benchmarks include various tasks
and datasets in order to evaluate the results of pretrained models via public
leaderboards. Notably, several benchmarks contain diagnostics datasets designed
for investigation and fine-grained error analysis across a wide range of
linguistic phenomena. This survey provides a comprehensive review of available
English, Arabic, and Multilingual NLU benchmarks, with a particular emphasis on
their diagnostics datasets and the linguistic phenomena they covered. We
present a detailed comparison and analysis of these benchmarks, highlighting
their strengths and limitations in evaluating NLU tasks and providing in-depth
error analysis. When highlighting the gaps in the state-of-the-art, we noted
that there is no naming convention for macro and micro categories or even a
standard set of linguistic phenomena that should be covered. Consequently, we
formulated a research question regarding the evaluation metrics of the
evaluation diagnostics benchmarks: "Why do not we have an evaluation standard
for the NLU evaluation diagnostics benchmarks?" similar to ISO standard in
industry. We conducted a deep analysis and comparisons of the covered
linguistic phenomena in order to support experts in building a global hierarchy
for linguistic phenomena in future. We think that having evaluation metrics for
diagnostics evaluation could be valuable to gain more insights when comparing
the results of the studied models on different diagnostics benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于代码提示的新方法，通过嵌入代码提供详细的BIO标记指令，显著提升了大型语言模型在命名实体识别任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅依赖输入上下文信息，未能充分捕捉NER任务的详细标记需求。

Method: 采用代码提示方法，嵌入BIO标记指令，结合链式思维提示进一步优化。

Result: 在10个跨语言基准测试中表现优于传统文本提示方法。

Conclusion: 代码提示方法有效提升了LLMs在NER任务中的性能，结合链式思维提示效果更佳。

Abstract: Recent studies have explored various approaches for treating candidate named
entity spans as both source and target sequences in named entity recognition
(NER) by leveraging large language models (LLMs). Although previous approaches
have successfully generated candidate named entity spans with suitable labels,
they rely solely on input context information when using LLMs, particularly,
ChatGPT. However, NER inherently requires capturing detailed labeling
requirements with input context information. To address this issue, we propose
a novel method that leverages code-based prompting to improve the capabilities
of LLMs in understanding and performing NER. By embedding code within prompts,
we provide detailed BIO schema instructions for labeling, thereby exploiting
the ability of LLMs to comprehend long-range scopes in programming languages.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed code-based prompting method
outperforms conventional text-based prompting on ten benchmarks across English,
Arabic, Finnish, Danish, and German datasets, indicating the effectiveness of
explicitly structuring NER instructions. We also verify that combining the
proposed code-based prompting method with the chain-of-thought prompting
further improves performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Text-JEPA是一个轻量级框架，用于将自然语言转换为一级逻辑（NL2FOL），结合了双系统认知理论，提升了封闭领域问答系统的效率和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在封闭领域（如教育、医疗和法律）中，用户不仅需要准确的答案，还需要透明的推理和可解释的决策过程。现有方法依赖大规模模型且效率低下。

Method: Text-JEPA框架结合了自然语言理解和符号推理，利用Z3求解器进行逻辑推理，并提出了三个评估指标。

Result: 在领域特定数据集上，Text-JEPA表现优异且计算开销显著低于大型LLM系统。

Conclusion: Text-JEPA展示了结构化、可解释推理框架在专业领域中构建高效问答系统的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced
question-answering (QA) capabilities, particularly in open-domain contexts.
However, in closed-domain scenarios such as education, healthcare, and law,
users demand not only accurate answers but also transparent reasoning and
explainable decision-making processes. While neural-symbolic (NeSy) frameworks
have emerged as a promising solution, leveraging LLMs for natural language
understanding and symbolic systems for formal reasoning, existing approaches
often rely on large-scale models and exhibit inefficiencies in translating
natural language into formal logic representations.
  To address these limitations, we introduce Text-JEPA (Text-based
Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture), a lightweight yet effective framework
for converting natural language into first-order logic (NL2FOL). Drawing
inspiration from dual-system cognitive theory, Text-JEPA emulates System 1 by
efficiently generating logic representations, while the Z3 solver operates as
System 2, enabling robust logical inference. To rigorously evaluate the
NL2FOL-to-reasoning pipeline, we propose a comprehensive evaluation framework
comprising three custom metrics: conversion score, reasoning score, and
Spearman rho score, which collectively capture the quality of logical
translation and its downstream impact on reasoning accuracy.
  Empirical results on domain-specific datasets demonstrate that Text-JEPA
achieves competitive performance with significantly lower computational
overhead compared to larger LLM-based systems. Our findings highlight the
potential of structured, interpretable reasoning frameworks for building
efficient and explainable QA systems in specialized domains.

Conclusion: SAND-Math为构建更高效数学推理LLM提供了实用且可扩展的工具包。

Abstract: The demand for Large Language Models (LLMs) capable of sophisticated
mathematical reasoning is growing across industries. However, the development
of performant mathematical LLMs is critically bottlenecked by the scarcity of
difficult, novel training data. We introduce \textbf{SAND-Math} (Synthetic
Augmented Novel and Difficult Mathematics problems and solutions), a pipeline
that addresses this by first generating high-quality problems from scratch and
then systematically elevating their complexity via a new \textbf{Difficulty
Hiking} step. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through two key
findings. First, augmenting a strong baseline with SAND-Math data significantly
boosts performance, outperforming the next-best synthetic dataset by
\textbf{$\uparrow$ 17.85 absolute points} on the AIME25 benchmark. Second, in a
dedicated ablation study, we show our Difficulty Hiking process is highly
effective: by increasing average problem difficulty from 5.02 to 5.98, this
step lifts AIME25 performance from 46.38\% to 49.23\%. The full generation
pipeline, final dataset, and a fine-tuned model form a practical and scalable
toolkit for building more capable and efficient mathematical reasoning LLMs.

counter-hate speech. Our findings provide insights into the spread of hate
messages on social media, the strategies used to counter them, and their
potential impact on online behavior.

become a critical challenge. To address this challenge, we focus on developing
a hallucination detection framework for black-box generators. Motivated by the
observation that hallucinations, once introduced, tend to persist, we sample
future contexts. The sampled future contexts provide valuable clues for
hallucination detection and can be effectively integrated with various
sampling-based methods. We extensively demonstrate performance improvements
across multiple methods using our proposed sampling approach.

Motivation: 社交媒体上的反社会行为（如仇恨言论、骚扰等）对平台安全和公共福祉构成挑战，现有研究主要集中在事后检测，而预测性方法旨在提前预防。

Method: 通过系统综述49项研究，提出五种任务类型的分类法，分析建模技术（从经典机器学习到预训练语言模型）及数据集特征的影响。

Conclusion: 本文通过统一框架为未来研究提供指导，旨在推动更稳健且社会责任感强的ASB预测方法。

Abstract: Antisocial behavior (ASB) on social media-including hate speech, harassment,
and trolling-poses growing challenges for platform safety and societal
wellbeing. While prior work has primarily focused on detecting harmful content
after it appears, predictive approaches aim to forecast future harmful
behaviors-such as hate speech propagation, conversation derailment, or user
recidivism-before they fully unfold. Despite increasing interest, the field
remains fragmented, lacking a unified taxonomy or clear synthesis of existing
methods. This paper presents a systematic review of over 49 studies on ASB
prediction, offering a structured taxonomy of five core task types: early harm
detection, harm emergence prediction, harm propagation prediction, behavioral
risk prediction, and proactive moderation support. We analyze how these tasks
differ by temporal framing, prediction granularity, and operational goals. In
addition, we examine trends in modeling techniques-from classical machine
learning to pre-trained language models-and assess the influence of dataset
characteristics on task feasibility and generalization. Our review highlights
methodological challenges, such as dataset scarcity, temporal drift, and
limited benchmarks, while outlining emerging research directions including
multilingual modeling, cross-platform generalization, and human-in-the-loop
systems. By organizing the field around a coherent framework, this survey aims
to guide future work toward more robust and socially responsible ASB
prediction.

Method: 提出OL-KGC方法，利用神经感知机制嵌入结构信息，并通过自动提取算法将本体知识转化为LLM可理解的文本格式。

Result: 在FB15K-237、UMLS和WN18RR基准测试中，OL-KGC显著优于现有主流方法，达到最优性能。

Conclusion: OL-KGC通过结合结构信息和本体知识，为LLM在KGC任务中提供了更深入的逻辑理解，实现了显著性能提升。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively adopted in Knowledge Graph
Completion (KGC), showcasing significant research advancements. However, as
black-box models driven by deep neural architectures, current LLM-based KGC
methods rely on implicit knowledge representation with parallel propagation of
erroneous knowledge, thereby hindering their ability to produce conclusive and
decisive reasoning outcomes. We aim to integrate neural-perceptual structural
information with ontological knowledge, leveraging the powerful capabilities of
LLMs to achieve a deeper understanding of the intrinsic logic of the knowledge.
We propose an ontology enhanced KGC method using LLMs -- OL-KGC. It first
leverages neural perceptual mechanisms to effectively embed structural
information into the textual space, and then uses an automated extraction
algorithm to retrieve ontological knowledge from the knowledge graphs (KGs)
that needs to be completed, which is further transformed into a textual format
comprehensible to LLMs for providing logic guidance. We conducted extensive
experiments on three widely-used benchmarks -- FB15K-237, UMLS and WN18RR. The
experimental results demonstrate that OL-KGC significantly outperforms existing
mainstream KGC methods across multiple evaluation metrics, achieving
state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO在处理异常奖励时存在策略更新不稳定的问题，GMPO旨在通过几何平均优化解决这一问题。

Method: GMPO通过最大化几何平均奖励而非算术平均，减少异常值的影响，保持重要性采样比的稳定性。

Result: GMPO-7B在多个数学和多模态推理基准测试中平均表现优于GRPO，分别提升4.1%和1.4%。

Conclusion: GMPO通过几何平均优化显著提升了稳定性和性能，适用于语言模型的推理任务。

Abstract: Recent advancements, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), have
enhanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models by optimizing the
arithmetic mean of token-level rewards. However, GRPO suffers from unstable
policy updates when processing tokens with outlier importance-weighted rewards,
which manifests as extreme importance sampling ratios during training, i.e.,
the ratio between the sampling probabilities assigned to a token by the current
and old policies. In this work, we propose Geometric-Mean Policy Optimization
(GMPO), a stabilized variant of GRPO. Instead of optimizing the arithmetic
mean, GMPO maximizes the geometric mean of token-level rewards, which is
inherently less sensitive to outliers and maintains a more stable range of
importance sampling ratio. In addition, we provide comprehensive theoretical
and experimental analysis to justify the design and stability benefits of GMPO.
Beyond improved stability, GMPO-7B outperforms GRPO by an average of 4.1% on
multiple mathematical benchmarks and 1.4% on multimodal reasoning benchmark,
including AIME24, AMC, MATH500, OlympiadBench, Minerva, and Geometry3K. Code is

Motivation: 研究多语言事实核查中大型语言模型的表现，填补其在细粒度分类任务中的研究空白。

Method: 在X-Fact数据集上评估五种语言模型，比较小型编码器模型（XLM-R、mT5）与大型解码器模型（Llama 3.1、Qwen 2.5、Mistral Nemo）的表现。

Result: XLM-R（2.7亿参数）以57.7%的宏F1分数显著优于所有测试的大型模型（7-120亿参数），性能提升15.8%。

Conclusion: 对于细粒度多语言事实核查，小型专业模型可能比通用大型模型更有效，对实际部署有重要启示。

Abstract: The rapid spread of multilingual misinformation requires robust automated
fact verification systems capable of handling fine-grained veracity assessments
across diverse languages. While large language models have shown remarkable
capabilities across many NLP tasks, their effectiveness for multilingual claim
verification with nuanced classification schemes remains understudied. We
conduct a comprehensive evaluation of five state-of-the-art language models on
the X-Fact dataset, which spans 25 languages with seven distinct veracity
categories. Our experiments compare small language models (encoder-based XLM-R
and mT5) with recent decoder-only LLMs (Llama 3.1, Qwen 2.5, Mistral Nemo)
using both prompting and fine-tuning approaches. Surprisingly, we find that
XLM-R (270M parameters) substantially outperforms all tested LLMs (7-12B
parameters), achieving 57.7% macro-F1 compared to the best LLM performance of
16.9%. This represents a 15.8% improvement over the previous state-of-the-art
(41.9%), establishing new performance benchmarks for multilingual fact
verification. Our analysis reveals problematic patterns in LLM behavior,
including systematic difficulties in leveraging evidence and pronounced biases
toward frequent categories in imbalanced data settings. These findings suggest
that for fine-grained multilingual fact verification, smaller specialized
models may be more effective than general-purpose large models, with important
implications for practical deployment of fact-checking systems.

content that combines text and images. Existing evaluation datasets heavily
lean towards text-only prompts, leaving visual vulnerabilities under evaluated.
To address this gap, we propose \textbf{Text2VLM}, a novel multi-stage pipeline
that adapts text-only datasets into multimodal formats, specifically designed
to evaluate the resilience of VLMs against typographic prompt injection
attacks. The Text2VLM pipeline identifies harmful content in the original text
and converts it into a typographic image, creating a multimodal prompt for
VLMs. Also, our evaluation of open-source VLMs highlights their increased
susceptibility to prompt injection when visual inputs are introduced, revealing
critical weaknesses in the current models' alignment. This is in addition to a
significant performance gap compared to closed-source frontier models. We
validate Text2VLM through human evaluations, ensuring the alignment of
extracted salient concepts; text summarization and output classification align
with human expectations. Text2VLM provides a scalable tool for comprehensive
safety assessment, contributing to the development of more robust safety
mechanisms for VLMs. By enhancing the evaluation of multimodal vulnerabilities,
Text2VLM plays a role in advancing the safe deployment of VLMs in diverse,
real-world applications.

*Yiran Huang,Lukas Thede,Massimiliano Mancini,Wenjia Xu,Zeynep Akata*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过结构剪枝和高效恢复训练直接压缩多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的方法，解决了现有参数减少技术计算密集和灵活性不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的计算和内存需求高，限制了实际部署。现有参数减少方法灵活性不足且计算密集。

Method: 采用层间和宽度剪枝两种结构剪枝范式，结合监督微调和知识蒸馏进行恢复训练，并评估少量数据下的恢复效果。

Result: 宽度剪枝在低资源场景下表现更好；仅微调多模态投影器即可在小压缩级别（<20%）下恢复性能；5%的训练数据可保留95%的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为压缩MLLMs提供了实用指导，无需大量计算资源或数据即可高效压缩。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate impressive
capabilities, their substantial computational and memory requirements pose
significant barriers to practical deployment. Current parameter reduction
techniques primarily involve training MLLMs from Small Language Models (SLMs),
but these methods offer limited flexibility and remain computationally
intensive. To address this gap, we propose to directly compress existing MLLMs
through structural pruning combined with efficient recovery training.
Specifically, we investigate two structural pruning paradigms--layerwise and
widthwise pruning--applied to the language model backbone of MLLMs, alongside
supervised finetuning and knowledge distillation. Additionally, we assess the
feasibility of conducting recovery training with only a small fraction of the
available data. Our results show that widthwise pruning generally maintains
better performance in low-resource scenarios with limited computational
resources or insufficient finetuning data. As for the recovery training,
finetuning only the multimodal projector is sufficient at small compression
levels (< 20%). Furthermore, a combination of supervised finetuning and
hidden-state distillation yields optimal recovery across various pruning
levels. Notably, effective recovery can be achieved with as little as 5% of the
original training data, while retaining over 95% of the original performance.
Through empirical study on two representative MLLMs, i.e., LLaVA-v1.5-7B and
Bunny-v1.0-3B, this study offers actionable insights for practitioners aiming
to compress MLLMs effectively without extensive computation resources or
sufficient data.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于合成多语言摘要数据的自我学习框架，用于评估多语言LLM的忠实性，无需依赖大量人工标注数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在多语言环境中的广泛应用，现有忠实性评估方法主要依赖英语和人工标注数据，亟需一种无需大量标注的多语言评估方案。

Method: 通过合成多语言摘要数据，结合跨语言迁移学习，训练自我学习评估器，并比较语言特定与混合语言微调方法。

Result: 实验表明，LLM的通用语言能力与其在特定语言评估任务中的表现相关，框架优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为多语言忠实性评估提供了高效且无需大量标注的解决方案。

Abstract: The growing use of large language models (LLMs) has increased the need for
automatic evaluation systems, particularly to address the challenge of
information hallucination. Although existing faithfulness evaluation approaches
have shown promise, they are predominantly English-focused and often require
expensive human-labeled training data for fine-tuning specialized models. As
LLMs see increased adoption in multilingual contexts, there is a need for
accurate faithfulness evaluators that can operate across languages without
extensive labeled data. This paper presents Self-Taught Evaluators for
Multilingual Faithfulness, a framework that learns exclusively from synthetic
multilingual summarization data while leveraging cross-lingual transfer
learning. Through experiments comparing language-specific and mixed-language
fine-tuning approaches, we demonstrate a consistent relationship between an
LLM's general language capabilities and its performance in language-specific
evaluation tasks. Our framework shows improvements over existing baselines,
including state-of-the-art English evaluators and machine translation-based
approaches.

Result: 论文系统总结了PLMs在GPTE中的关键作用，并提出了未来研究方向，如安全性、偏见缓解等。

Conclusion: 该综述为研究GPTE的新手和资深学者提供了当前状态和未来潜力的参考。

Abstract: Text embeddings have attracted growing interest due to their effectiveness
across a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as
retrieval, classification, clustering, bitext mining, and summarization. With
the emergence of pretrained language models (PLMs), general-purpose text
embeddings (GPTE) have gained significant traction for their ability to produce
rich, transferable representations. The general architecture of GPTE typically
leverages PLMs to derive dense text representations, which are then optimized
through contrastive learning on large-scale pairwise datasets. In this survey,
we provide a comprehensive overview of GPTE in the era of PLMs, focusing on the
roles PLMs play in driving its development. We first examine the fundamental
architecture and describe the basic roles of PLMs in GPTE, i.e., embedding
extraction, expressivity enhancement, training strategies, learning objectives,
and data construction. Then, we describe advanced roles enabled by PLMs, such
as multilingual support, multimodal integration, code understanding, and
scenario-specific adaptation. Finally, we highlight potential future research
directions that move beyond traditional improvement goals, including ranking
integration, safety considerations, bias mitigation, structural information
incorporation, and the cognitive extension of embeddings. This survey aims to
serve as a valuable reference for both newcomers and established researchers
seeking to understand the current state and future potential of GPTE.

TL;DR: 自动化语言模型工具PFD Toolkit成功复现并改进了手动分析的儿童自杀PFD报告识别与主题分析，显著提升了效率和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统手动分析PFD报告耗时且效率低，需要自动化工具提升分析速度和准确性。

Method: 使用开源语言模型PFD Toolkit自动处理4,249份PFD报告，识别儿童自杀案例并分类主题。

Result: PFD Toolkit识别出72份儿童自杀报告（比手动多一倍），与临床标注一致性高（Cohen’s κ=0.82）。

Conclusion: 自动化LLM分析可高效复现手动主题分析，为公共卫生提供可扩展、可重复的及时见解。

Abstract: Prevention of Future Deaths (PFD) reports, issued by coroners in England and
Wales, flag systemic hazards that may lead to further loss of life. Analysis of
these reports has previously been constrained by the manual effort required to
identify and code relevant cases. In 2025, the Office for National Statistics
(ONS) published a national thematic review of child-suicide PFD reports ($\leq$
18 years), identifying 37 cases from January 2015 to November 2023 - a process
based entirely on manual curation and coding. We evaluated whether a fully
automated, open source "text-to-table" language-model pipeline (PFD Toolkit)
could reproduce the ONS's identification and thematic analysis of child-suicide
PFD reports, and assessed gains in efficiency and reliability. All 4,249 PFD
reports published from July 2013 to November 2023 were processed via PFD
Toolkit's large language model pipelines. Automated screening identified cases
where the coroner attributed death to suicide in individuals aged 18 or
younger, and eligible reports were coded for recipient category and 23 concern
sub-themes, replicating the ONS coding frame. PFD Toolkit identified 72
child-suicide PFD reports - almost twice the ONS count. Three blinded
clinicians adjudicated a stratified sample of 144 reports to validate the
child-suicide screening. Against the post-consensus clinical annotations, the
LLM-based workflow showed substantial to almost-perfect agreement (Cohen's
$\kappa$ = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.66-0.98, raw agreement = 91%). The end-to-end script
runtime was 8m 16s, transforming a process that previously took months into one
that can be completed in minutes. This demonstrates that automated LLM analysis
can reliably and efficiently replicate manual thematic reviews of coronial
data, enabling scalable, reproducible, and timely insights for public health
and safety. The PFD Toolkit is openly available for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视用户间差异，依赖语言提示效果有限，需更有效建模差异。

Method: DEP通过对比用户嵌入与同行嵌入构建软提示，稀疏自编码器过滤无关特征后注入冻结LLM。

Result: 实验表明DEP在个性化评论生成中优于基线方法。

Conclusion: DEP通过潜在空间建模用户差异，显著提升个性化效果。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into users' daily
lives, leading to a growing demand for personalized outputs. Previous work
focuses on leveraging a user's own history, overlooking inter-user differences
that are crucial for effective personalization. While recent work has attempted
to model such differences, the reliance on language-based prompts often hampers
the effective extraction of meaningful distinctions. To address these issues,
we propose Difference-aware Embedding-based Personalization (DEP), a framework
that models inter-user differences in the latent space instead of relying on
language prompts. DEP constructs soft prompts by contrasting a user's embedding
with those of peers who engaged with similar content, highlighting relative
behavioral signals. A sparse autoencoder then filters and compresses both
user-specific and difference-aware embeddings, preserving only task-relevant
features before injecting them into a frozen LLM. Experiments on personalized
review generation show that DEP consistently outperforms baseline methods
across multiple metrics. Our code is available at
https://github.com/SnowCharmQ/DEP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多样性在NLP中日益重要，但缺乏系统化理论支持，研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 调查了ACL Anthology过去6年标题含“diversity”或“diverse”的文章，提出统一分类法，并基于Stirling框架分析多样性。

Result: 发现多样性量化方法多样且术语不一致，通过统一框架揭示了多样性测量的趋势。

Conclusion: 研究为NLP中多样性的形式化提供了基础，有助于提升理解和方法的可比性。

Abstract: The concept of diversity has received increased consideration in Natural
Language Processing (NLP) in recent years. This is due to various motivations
like promoting and inclusion, approximating human linguistic behavior, and
increasing systems' performance. Diversity has however often been addressed in
an ad hoc manner in NLP, and with few explicit links to other domains where
this notion is better theorized. We survey articles in the ACL Anthology from
the past 6 years, with "diversity" or "diverse" in their title. We find a wide
range of settings in which diversity is quantified, often highly specialized
and using inconsistent terminology. We put forward a unified taxonomy of why,
what on, where, and how diversity is measured in NLP. Diversity measures are
cast upon a unified framework from ecology and economy (Stirling, 2007) with 3
dimensions of diversity: variety, balance and disparity. We discuss the trends
which emerge due to this systematized approach. We believe that this study
paves the way towards a better formalization of diversity in NLP, which should
bring a better understanding of this notion and a better comparability between
various approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗报告信息丰富但非结构化且使用专业语言，专有LLM存在透明度和隐私问题，因此研究开源LLM的潜力。

Method: 开发了公开框架llm_extractinator，在零样本设置下评估模型性能，使用DRAGON基准（28个荷兰语临床任务）。

Result: 14B参数模型（如Phi-4-14B）表现优异，70B模型性能略高但计算成本大；翻译至英语会降低性能。

Conclusion: 开源LLM结合框架可提供高效、可扩展且隐私友好的临床信息提取方案，尤其适用于低资源环境。

Abstract: Medical reports contain rich clinical information but are often unstructured
and written in domain-specific language, posing challenges for information
extraction. While proprietary large language models (LLMs) have shown promise
in clinical natural language processing, their lack of transparency and data
privacy concerns limit their utility in healthcare. This study therefore
evaluates nine open-source generative LLMs on the DRAGON benchmark, which
includes 28 clinical information extraction tasks in Dutch. We developed
\texttt{llm\_extractinator}, a publicly available framework for information
extraction using open-source generative LLMs, and used it to assess model
performance in a zero-shot setting. Several 14 billion parameter models,
Phi-4-14B, Qwen-2.5-14B, and DeepSeek-R1-14B, achieved competitive results,
while the bigger Llama-3.3-70B model achieved slightly higher performance at
greater computational cost. Translation to English prior to inference
consistently degraded performance, highlighting the need of native-language
processing. These findings demonstrate that open-source LLMs, when used with
our framework, offer effective, scalable, and privacy-conscious solutions for
clinical information extraction in low-resource settings.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Soft Injection的方法，通过任务嵌入和软混合参数优化，减少提示长度并提升任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多示例提示是否是最有效传达任务信息的方式，并探索更高效的任务条件传递方法。

Method: 使用少量示例构建任务嵌入，并通过软混合参数将其与注意力头激活结合，避免推理时的重复计算。

Result: 在57个任务和12个LLM上验证，平均性能比10-shot ICL提升10.1%-13.9%，同时降低内存和计算成本。

Conclusion: Soft Injection方法通过将任务条件从提示空间转移到激活空间，为减少提示长度和提升性能提供了新范式。

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform
tasks by conditioning on input-output examples in the prompt, without requiring
any update in model parameters. While widely adopted, it remains unclear
whether prompting with multiple examples is the most effective and efficient
way to convey task information. In this work, we propose Soft Injection of task
embeddings. The task embeddings are constructed only once using few-shot ICL
prompts and repeatedly used during inference. Soft injection is performed by
softly mixing task embeddings with attention head activations using
pre-optimized mixing parameters, referred to as soft head-selection parameters.
This method not only allows a desired task to be performed without in-prompt
demonstrations but also significantly outperforms existing ICL approaches while
reducing memory usage and compute cost at inference time. An extensive
evaluation is performed across 57 tasks and 12 LLMs, spanning four model
families of sizes from 4B to 70B. Averaged across 57 tasks, our method
outperforms 10-shot ICL by 10.1%-13.9% across 12 LLMs. Additional analyses show
that our method also serves as an insightful tool for analyzing task-relevant
roles of attention heads, revealing that task-relevant head positions selected
by our method transfer across similar tasks but not across dissimilar ones --
underscoring the task-specific nature of head functionality. Our soft injection
method opens a new paradigm for reducing prompt length and improving task
performance by shifting task conditioning from the prompt space to the
activation space.

Understanding or Reasoning, enabling a detailed analysis of models' cognitive
capabilities. We validate the MediQAl dataset through extensive evaluation with
14 large language models, including recent reasoning-augmented models, and
observe a significant performance gap between factual recall and reasoning
tasks. Our evaluation provides a comprehensive benchmark for assessing language
models' performance on French medical question answering, addressing a crucial
gap in multilingual resources for the medical domain.

Abstract: Sexism has become widespread on social media and in online conversation. To
help address this issue, the fifth Sexism Identification in Social Networks
(EXIST) challenge is initiated at CLEF 2025. Among this year's international
benchmarks, we concentrate on solving the first task aiming to identify and
classify sexism in social media textual posts. In this paper, we describe our
solutions and report results for three subtasks: Subtask 1.1 - Sexism
Identification in Tweets, Subtask 1.2 - Source Intention in Tweets, and Subtask
1.3 - Sexism Categorization in Tweets. We implement three models to address
each subtask which constitute three individual runs: Speech Concept Bottleneck
Model (SCBM), Speech Concept Bottleneck Model with Transformer (SCBMT), and a
fine-tuned XLM-RoBERTa transformer model. SCBM uses descriptive adjectives as
human-interpretable bottleneck concepts. SCBM leverages large language models
(LLMs) to encode input texts into a human-interpretable representation of
adjectives, then used to train a lightweight classifier for downstream tasks.
SCBMT extends SCBM by fusing adjective-based representation with contextual
embeddings from transformers to balance interpretability and classification
performance. Beyond competitive results, these two models offer fine-grained
explanations at both instance (local) and class (global) levels. We also
investigate how additional metadata, e.g., annotators' demographic profiles,
can be leveraged. For Subtask 1.1, XLM-RoBERTa, fine-tuned on provided data
augmented with prior datasets, ranks 6th for English and Spanish and 4th for
English in the Soft-Soft evaluation. Our SCBMT achieves 7th for English and
Spanish and 6th for Spanish.

Abstract: Hallucinations in large language models pose a critical challenge for
applications requiring factual reliability, particularly in high-stakes domains
such as finance. This work presents an effective approach for detecting and
editing factually incorrect content in model-generated responses based on the
provided context. Given a user-defined domain-specific error taxonomy, we
construct a synthetic dataset by inserting tagged errors into financial
question-answering corpora and then fine-tune four language models, Phi-4,
Phi-4-mini, Qwen3-4B, and Qwen3-14B, to detect and edit these factual
inaccuracies. Our best-performing model, fine-tuned Phi-4, achieves an 8%
improvement in binary F1 score and a 30% gain in overall detection performance
compared to OpenAI-o3. Notably, our fine-tuned Phi-4-mini model, despite having
only 4 billion parameters, maintains competitive performance with just a 2%
drop in binary detection and a 0.1% decline in overall detection compared to
OpenAI-o3. Our work provides a practical solution for detecting and editing
factual inconsistencies in financial text generation while introducing a
generalizable framework that can enhance the trustworthiness and alignment of
large language models across diverse applications beyond finance. Our code and

Result: 指令微调显著降低多样性，DPO影响最大；符合性解码能增加多样性并保持或提升质量。

Conclusion: 指令微调损害多样性，但通过符合性解码可部分恢复多样性，为平衡多样性和质量提供了新方法。

Abstract: Instruction-tuning large language models (LLMs) reduces the diversity of
their outputs, which has implications for many tasks, particularly for creative
tasks. This paper investigates the ``diversity gap'' for a writing prompt
narrative generation task. This gap emerges as measured by current diversity
metrics for various open-weight and open-source LLMs. The results show
significant decreases in diversity due to instruction-tuning. We explore the
diversity loss at each fine-tuning stage for the OLMo and OLMo 2 models to
further understand how output diversity is affected. The results indicate that
DPO has the most substantial impact on diversity. Motivated by these findings,
we present a new decoding strategy, conformative decoding, which guides an
instruct model using its more diverse base model to reintroduce output
diversity. We show that conformative decoding typically increases diversity and
even maintains or improves quality.

Method: 采用两种方法：成员推理攻击检测记忆数据，以及基于前缀提示的生成任务评估逐字复制。分析了权重矩阵、困惑度与记忆的关系，以及LoRA微调中秩的影响。

Result: 发现Value和Output矩阵对记忆影响更大；低困惑度模型记忆更多；高LoRA秩增加记忆但边际效应递减。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM微调中性能与隐私的权衡，为开发更有效且负责任的模型适应策略提供了依据。

Abstract: This study investigates the mechanisms and factors influencing memorization
in fine-tuned large language models (LLMs), with a focus on the medical domain
due to its privacy-sensitive nature. We examine how different aspects of the
fine-tuning process affect a model's propensity to memorize training data,
using the PHEE dataset of pharmacovigilance events.
  Our research employs two main approaches: a membership inference attack to
detect memorized data, and a generation task with prompted prefixes to assess
verbatim reproduction. We analyze the impact of adapting different weight
matrices in the transformer architecture, the relationship between perplexity
and memorization, and the effect of increasing the rank in low-rank adaptation
(LoRA) fine-tuning.
  Key findings include: (1) Value and Output matrices contribute more
significantly to memorization compared to Query and Key matrices; (2) Lower
perplexity in the fine-tuned model correlates with increased memorization; (3)
Higher LoRA ranks lead to increased memorization, but with diminishing returns
at higher ranks.
  These results provide insights into the trade-offs between model performance
and privacy risks in fine-tuned LLMs. Our findings have implications for
developing more effective and responsible strategies for adapting large
language models while managing data privacy concerns.

approach to leverage LLM agents to believably simulate human evaluators. Yet,
to date, existing LLM-as-a-judge approaches face two limitations: persona
descriptions of agents are often arbitrarily designed, and the frameworks are
not generalizable to other tasks. To address these challenges, we propose
MAJ-EVAL, a Multi-Agent-as-Judge evaluation framework that can automatically
construct multiple evaluator personas with distinct dimensions from relevant
text documents (e.g., research papers), instantiate LLM agents with the
personas, and engage in-group debates with multi-agents to Generate
multi-dimensional feedback. Our evaluation experiments in both the educational
and medical domains demonstrate that MAJ-EVAL can generate evaluation results
that better align with human experts' ratings compared with conventional
automated evaluation metrics and existing LLM-as-a-judge methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于自适应伽马校正（TAGC）的低光照图像增强模型，通过自动计算伽马值提升图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低光照条件下图像质量下降，表现为低对比度、噪声和细节模糊，亟需高效解决方案。

Method: 通过分析图像颜色亮度和平均颜色，自动计算自适应伽马系数，无需人工干预。

Result: TAGC模型有效提升了低光照图像的细节、对比度和色彩分布，视觉质量自然。

Conclusion: TAGC是一种高效的低光照图像处理方案，适用于夜间监控、医学图像和低光照摄影等领域。

Abstract: Enhancing images in low-light conditions is an important challenge in
computer vision. Insufficient illumination negatively affects the quality of
images, resulting in low contrast, intensive noise, and blurred details. This
paper presents a model for enhancing low-light images called tuning adaptive
gamma correction (TAGC). The model is based on analyzing the color luminance of
the low-light image and calculating the average color to determine the adaptive
gamma coefficient. The gamma value is calculated automatically and adaptively
at different illumination levels suitable for the image without human
intervention or manual adjustment. Based on qualitative and quantitative
evaluation, tuning adaptive gamma correction model has effectively improved
low-light images while maintaining details, natural contrast, and correct color
distribution. It also provides natural visual quality. It can be considered a
more efficient solution for processing low-light images in multiple
applications such as night surveillance, improving the quality of medical
images, and photography in low-light environments.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了医学影像数据稀缺问题，提出了一种通过因果框架控制特征差异的方法，提升了分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像数据稀缺，数据池化和数据添加可能引发分布偏移，影响模型性能。

Method: 利用因果框架控制深度网络中前景-背景特征差异，优化特征表示。

Result: 在五个数据集上实现了最先进的分割性能，包括一个新贡献的超声数据集。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在多种模型架构中表现优异，代码将开源。

Abstract: Data scarcity is a major challenge in medical imaging, particularly for deep
learning models. While data pooling (combining datasets from multiple sources)
and data addition (adding more data from a new dataset) have been shown to
enhance model performance, they are not without complications. Specifically,
increasing the size of the training dataset through pooling or addition can
induce distributional shifts, negatively affecting downstream model
performance, a phenomenon known as the "Data Addition Dilemma". While the
traditional i.i.d. assumption may not hold in multi-source contexts, assuming
exchangeability across datasets provides a more practical framework for data
pooling. In this work, we investigate medical image segmentation under these
conditions, drawing insights from causal frameworks to propose a method for
controlling foreground-background feature discrepancies across all layers of
deep networks. This approach improves feature representations, which are
crucial in data-addition scenarios. Our method achieves state-of-the-art
segmentation performance on histopathology and ultrasound images across five
datasets, including a novel ultrasound dataset that we have curated and
contributed. Qualitative results demonstrate more refined and accurate
segmentation maps compared to prominent baselines across three model
architectures. The code will be available on Github.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型Transformer感知的多尺度渐进编码器-解码器网络（T-MPEDNet），用于自动化肝脏和肿瘤分割，解决了肿瘤异质性和肝脏视觉多样性带来的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化肝脏和肿瘤分割在快速诊断和制定治疗方案中至关重要，但面临肿瘤异质性和肝脏视觉多样性的挑战。

Method: T-MPEDNet采用渐进编码器-解码器结构，结合Transformer动态注意力机制和多尺度特征利用，辅以形态学边界细化。

Result: 在LiTS和3DIRCADb数据集上，T-MPEDNet在肝脏和肿瘤分割中分别达到97.6%/89.1%和98.3%/83.3%的DSC，优于12种先进方法。

Conclusion: T-MPEDNet是一种高效可靠的自动化肝脏和肿瘤分割框架。

Abstract: Precise and automated segmentation of the liver and its tumor within CT scans
plays a pivotal role in swift diagnosis and the development of optimal
treatment plans for individuals with liver diseases and malignancies. However,
automated liver and tumor segmentation faces significant hurdles arising from
the inherent heterogeneity of tumors and the diverse visual characteristics of
livers across a broad spectrum of patients. Aiming to address these challenges,
we present a novel Transformer-aware Multiscale Progressive Encoder-Decoder
Network (T-MPEDNet) for automated segmentation of tumor and liver. T-MPEDNet
leverages a deep adaptive features backbone through a progressive
encoder-decoder structure, enhanced by skip connections for recalibrating
channel-wise features while preserving spatial integrity. A
Transformer-inspired dynamic attention mechanism captures long-range contextual
relationships within the spatial domain, further enhanced by multi-scale
feature utilization for refined local details, leading to accurate prediction.
Morphological boundary refinement is then employed to address indistinct
boundaries with neighboring organs, capturing finer details and yielding
precise boundary labels. The efficacy of T-MPEDNet is comprehensively assessed
on two widely utilized public benchmark datasets, LiTS and 3DIRCADb. Extensive
quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate the superiority of T-MPEDNet
compared to twelve state-of-the-art methods. On LiTS, T-MPEDNet achieves
outstanding Dice Similarity Coefficients (DSC) of 97.6% and 89.1% for liver and
tumor segmentation, respectively. Similar performance is observed on 3DIRCADb,
with DSCs of 98.3% and 83.3% for liver and tumor segmentation, respectively.
Our findings prove that T-MPEDNet is an efficacious and reliable framework for
automated segmentation of the liver and its tumor in CT scans.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于自然语言的视频分析系统Lava，通过高效采样、开放世界检测和轨迹提取，显著提升了查询灵活性和处理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代城市环境中，海量视频数据需要高效分析，但现有SQL范式限制了查询灵活性。

Method: Lava系统包含三个组件：基于多臂老虎机的高效采样、开放世界检测模块和长期轨迹提取方案。

Result: 实验表明，Lava在查询精度和速度上显著优于基线方法，F1分数提升14%，处理速度快9.6倍。

Conclusion: Lava通过自然语言驱动，实现了灵活高效的视频分析，为大规模视频数据处理提供了新思路。

Abstract: In modern urban environments, camera networks generate massive amounts of
operational footage -- reaching petabytes each day -- making scalable video
analytics essential for efficient processing. Many existing approaches adopt an
SQL-based paradigm for querying such large-scale video databases; however, this
constrains queries to rigid patterns with predefined semantic categories,
significantly limiting analytical flexibility. In this work, we explore a
language-driven video analytics paradigm aimed at enabling flexible and
efficient querying of high-volume video data driven by natural language.
Particularly, we build \textsc{Lava}, a system that accepts natural language
queries and retrieves traffic targets across multiple levels of granularity and
arbitrary categories. \textsc{Lava} comprises three main components: 1) a
multi-armed bandit-based efficient sampling method for video segment-level
localization;
  2) a video-specific open-world detection module for object-level retrieval;
and 3) a long-term object trajectory extraction scheme for temporal object
association, yielding complete trajectories for object-of-interests. To support
comprehensive evaluation, we further develop a novel benchmark by providing
diverse, semantically rich natural language predicates and fine-grained
annotations for multiple videos. Experiments on this benchmark demonstrate that
\textsc{Lava} improves $F_1$-scores for selection queries by $\mathbf{14\%}$,
reduces MPAE for aggregation queries by $\mathbf{0.39}$, and achieves top-$k$
precision of $\mathbf{86\%}$, while processing videos $ \mathbf{9.6\times} $
faster than the most accurate baseline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅单独处理手术器械的实例级分割（IIS）或部分级语义分割（PSS），缺乏任务间的交互，限制了自动化手术的准确性。

Method: 采用基于Transformer的掩码分类方法，通过部分特定查询显式链接部分与父实例，并提出弱监督学习和师生框架以处理不完整标注数据。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证了SurgPIS的有效性，在PIS、IIS、PSS和器械级语义分割任务中均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: SurgPIS通过统一框架和弱监督学习，显著提升了手术器械分割的性能，为自动化手术提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Consistent surgical instrument segmentation is critical for automation in
robot-assisted surgery. Yet, existing methods only treat instrument-level
instance segmentation (IIS) or part-level semantic segmentation (PSS)
separately, without interaction between these tasks. In this work, we formulate
a surgical tool segmentation as a unified part-aware instance segmentation
(PIS) problem and introduce SurgPIS, the first PIS model for surgical
instruments. Our method adopts a transformer-based mask classification approach
and introduces part-specific queries derived from instrument-level object
queries, explicitly linking parts to their parent instrument instances. In
order to address the lack of large-scale datasets with both instance- and
part-level labels, we propose a weakly-supervised learning strategy for SurgPIS
to learn from disjoint datasets labelled for either IIS or PSS purposes. During
training, we aggregate our PIS predictions into IIS or PSS masks, thereby
allowing us to compute a loss against partially labelled datasets. A
student-teacher approach is developed to maintain prediction consistency for
missing PIS information in the partially labelled data, e.g., parts of the IIS
labelled data. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets validate the
effectiveness of SurgPIS, achieving state-of-the-art performance in PIS as well
as IIS, PSS, and instrument-level semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: 该模型在多模态、对象中心的视频和图像理解中表现出鲁棒性，为视频交互提供了更灵活的方式。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable
progress in general video understanding. However, existing models primarily
focus on high-level comprehension and are limited to text-only responses,
restricting the flexibility for object-centric, multiround interactions. In
this paper, we make three contributions: (i) we address these limitations by
introducing a VideoLLM model, capable of performing both object referring for
input and grounding for output in video reasoning tasks, i.e., allowing users
to interact with videos using both textual and visual prompts; (ii) we propose
STOM (Spatial-Temporal Overlay Module), a novel approach that propagates
arbitrary visual prompts input at any single timestamp to the remaining frames
within a video; (iii) we present VideoInfer, a manually curated object-centric
video instruction dataset featuring questionanswering pairs that require
reasoning. We conduct comprehensive experiments on VideoInfer and other
existing benchmarks across video question answering and referring object
segmentation. The results on 12 benchmarks of 6 tasks show that our proposed
model consistently outperforms baselines in both video question answering and
segmentation, underscoring its robustness in multimodal, object-centric video
and image understanding. Project page:

TL;DR: Exemplar Med-DETR提出了一种多模态对比检测器，通过跨注意力和迭代训练策略，显著提升了医学图像中异常检测的性能，尤其在乳腺X光、胸透和血管造影中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像中异常检测面临特征表示差异和复杂解剖结构关系的挑战，现有方法难以学习有效的类别特定特征，限制了跨任务和模态的适用性。

Method: 提出Exemplar Med-DETR，一种基于多模态对比的检测器，利用跨注意力机制和直观的类别特定示例特征，采用迭代训练策略。

Result: 在四种公共数据集上实现最优性能，乳腺X光检测mAP达0.7（肿块）和0.55（钙化），胸透和血管造影检测mAP分别提升4和7个百分点。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了在医学图像中构建鲁棒且通用检测系统的潜力。

Abstract: Detecting abnormalities in medical images poses unique challenges due to
differences in feature representations and the intricate relationship between
anatomical structures and abnormalities. This is especially evident in
mammography, where dense breast tissue can obscure lesions, complicating
radiological interpretation. Despite leveraging anatomical and semantic
context, existing detection methods struggle to learn effective class-specific
features, limiting their applicability across different tasks and imaging
modalities. In this work, we introduce Exemplar Med-DETR, a novel multi-modal
contrastive detector that enables feature-based detection. It employs
cross-attention with inherently derived, intuitive class-specific exemplar
features and is trained with an iterative strategy. We achieve state-of-the-art
performance across three distinct imaging modalities from four public datasets.
On Vietnamese dense breast mammograms, we attain an mAP of 0.7 for mass
detection and 0.55 for calcifications, yielding an absolute improvement of 16
percentage points. Additionally, a radiologist-supported evaluation of 100
mammograms from an out-of-distribution Chinese cohort demonstrates a twofold
gain in lesion detection performance. For chest X-rays and angiography, we
achieve an mAP of 0.25 for mass and 0.37 for stenosis detection, improving
results by 4 and 7 percentage points, respectively. These results highlight the
potential of our approach to advance robust and generalizable detection systems
for medical imaging.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于测试时训练（TTT）的假新闻视频检测框架T$^3$SVFND，通过自监督辅助任务提升模型对紧急新闻的检测鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有假新闻视频检测方法因不同事件间分布偏移而泛化能力不足，尤其在紧急新闻场景下性能显著下降。

Method: 设计基于掩码语言建模（MLM）的自监督辅助任务，结合多模态（音频和视频）上下文信息预测掩码词，测试时通过辅助任务适应测试数据分布。

Result: 在公共基准测试中表现优异，尤其在紧急新闻检测上效果显著。

Conclusion: T$^3$SVFND框架有效解决了分布偏移问题，提升了假新闻视频检测的鲁棒性。

Abstract: The existing methods for fake news videos detection may not be generalized,
because there is a distribution shift between short video news of different
events, and the performance of such techniques greatly drops if news records
are coming from emergencies. We propose a new fake news videos detection
framework (T$^3$SVFND) using Test-Time Training (TTT) to alleviate this
limitation, enhancing the robustness of fake news videos detection.
Specifically, we design a self-supervised auxiliary task based on Mask Language
Modeling (MLM) that masks a certain percentage of words in text and predicts
these masked words by combining contextual information from different
modalities (audio and video). In the test-time training phase, the model adapts
to the distribution of test data through auxiliary tasks. Extensive experiments
on the public benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model,
especially for the detection of emergency news.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation continues to advance rapidly, yet rigorous
comparison between methods remains challenging due to a lack of standardized
and customizable tooling. In this work, we present the current state of the
Medical Imaging Segmentation Toolkit (MIST), with a particular focus on its
flexible and modular postprocessing framework designed for the BraTS 2025 pre-
and post-treatment glioma segmentation challenge. Since its debut in the 2024
BraTS adult glioma post-treatment segmentation challenge, MIST's postprocessing
module has been significantly extended to support a wide range of transforms,
including removal or replacement of small objects, extraction of the largest
connected components, and morphological operations such as hole filling and
closing. These transforms can be composed into user-defined strategies,
enabling fine-grained control over the final segmentation output. We evaluate
three such strategies - ranging from simple small-object removal to more
complex, class-specific pipelines - and rank their performance using the BraTS
ranking protocol. Our results highlight how MIST facilitates rapid
experimentation and targeted refinement, ultimately producing high-quality
segmentations for the BraTS 2025 challenge. MIST remains open source and
extensible, supporting reproducible and scalable research in medical image
segmentation.

Method: 使用商业生成AI工具创建了包含10,710张面部表情图像的合成数据集，覆盖五种种族、两个年龄组和两种性别，并通过临床验证工具分析疼痛表达。

Abstract: Accurate pain assessment in patients with limited ability to communicate,
such as older adults with dementia, represents a critical healthcare challenge.
Robust automated systems of pain detection may facilitate such assessments.
Existing pain detection datasets, however, suffer from limited ethnic/racial
diversity, privacy constraints, and underrepresentation of older adults who are
the primary target population for clinical deployment. We present SynPAIN, a
large-scale synthetic dataset containing 10,710 facial expression images (5,355
neutral/expressive pairs) across five ethnicities/races, two age groups (young:
20-35, old: 75+), and two genders. Using commercial generative AI tools, we
created demographically balanced synthetic identities with clinically
meaningful pain expressions. Our validation demonstrates that synthetic pain
expressions exhibit expected pain patterns, scoring significantly higher than
neutral and non-pain expressions using clinically validated pain assessment
tools based on facial action unit analysis. We experimentally demonstrate
SynPAIN's utility in identifying algorithmic bias in existing pain detection
models. Through comprehensive bias evaluation, we reveal substantial
performance disparities across demographic characteristics. These performance
disparities were previously undetectable with smaller, less diverse datasets.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that age-matched synthetic data augmentation
improves pain detection performance on real clinical data, achieving a 7.0%
improvement in average precision. SynPAIN addresses critical gaps in pain
assessment research by providing the first publicly available, demographically
diverse synthetic dataset specifically designed for older adult pain detection,
while establishing a framework for measuring and mitigating algorithmic bias.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在复杂提示下生成图像时缺乏风格一致性和空间连贯性，限制了可控内容生成的实用性。

Method: 提出Local Prompt Adaptation (LPA)，将提示词分解为内容和风格标记，分阶段注入U-Net的注意力层。

Result: 在50个风格丰富的提示词上评估，LPA在CLIP分数和风格一致性上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: LPA为可控、表达性强的扩散模型生成提供了新方向。

Abstract: Diffusion models have become a powerful backbone for text-to-image
generation, enabling users to synthesize high-quality visuals from natural
language prompts. However, they often struggle with complex prompts involving
multiple objects and global or local style specifications. In such cases, the
generated scenes tend to lack style uniformity and spatial coherence, limiting
their utility in creative and controllable content generation. In this paper,
we propose a simple, training-free architectural method called Local Prompt
Adaptation (LPA). Our method decomposes the prompt into content and style
tokens, and injects them selectively into the U-Net's attention layers at
different stages. By conditioning object tokens early and style tokens later in
the generation process, LPA enhances both layout control and stylistic
consistency. We evaluate our method on a custom benchmark of 50 style-rich
prompts across five categories and compare against strong baselines including
Composer, MultiDiffusion, Attend-and-Excite, LoRA, and SDXL. Our approach
outperforms prior work on both CLIP score and style consistency metrics,
offering a new direction for controllable, expressive diffusion-based
generation.

Motivation: 卡通动画生成面临非人类角色复杂性、多样化动作和细腻情感的挑战，且缺乏大规模标注的多模态数据。

Method: 构建了包含40万视频片段的多模态数据集MagicAnime，并设计了MagicAnime-Bench基准测试，支持四项动画生成任务。

Result: 实验验证了数据集在支持高保真、细粒度和可控生成方面的有效性。

Conclusion: MagicAnime数据集和基准测试为卡通动画生成提供了重要资源，推动了多模态控制技术的发展。

Abstract: Generating high-quality cartoon animations multimodal control is challenging
due to the complexity of non-human characters, stylistically diverse motions
and fine-grained emotions. There is a huge domain gap between real-world videos
and cartoon animation, as cartoon animation is usually abstract and has
exaggerated motion. Meanwhile, public multimodal cartoon data are extremely
scarce due to the difficulty of large-scale automatic annotation processes
compared with real-life scenarios. To bridge this gap, We propose the
MagicAnime dataset, a large-scale, hierarchically annotated, and multimodal
dataset designed to support multiple video generation tasks, along with the
benchmarks it includes. Containing 400k video clips for image-to-video
generation, 50k pairs of video clips and keypoints for whole-body annotation,
12k pairs of video clips for video-to-video face animation, and 2.9k pairs of
video and audio clips for audio-driven face animation. Meanwhile, we also build
a set of multi-modal cartoon animation benchmarks, called MagicAnime-Bench, to
support the comparisons of different methods in the tasks above. Comprehensive
experiments on four tasks, including video-driven face animation, audio-driven
face animation, image-to-video animation, and pose-driven character animation,
validate its effectiveness in supporting high-fidelity, fine-grained, and
controllable generation.

Conclusion: 半监督DPO微调能高效利用未标注数据，显著提升模型性能，适用于大规模应用。

Abstract: Image-based product attribute prediction in e-commerce is a crucial task with
numerous applications. The supervised fine-tuning of Vision Language Models
(VLMs) faces significant scale challenges due to the cost of manual or API
based annotation. In this paper, we investigate label-efficient semi-supervised
fine-tuning strategies for compact VLMs (2B-3B parameters) that leverage
unlabeled product listings through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).
Beginning with a small, API-based, annotated, and labeled set, we first employ
PEFT to train low-rank adapter modules. To update the adapter weights with
unlabeled data, we generate multiple reasoning-and-answer chains per unlabeled
sample and segregate these chains into preferred and dispreferred based on
self-consistency. We then fine-tune the model with DPO loss and use the updated
model for the next iteration. By using PEFT fine-tuning with DPO, our method
achieves efficient convergence with minimal compute overhead. On a dataset
spanning twelve e-commerce verticals, DPO-based fine-tuning, which utilizes
only unlabeled data, demonstrates a significant improvement over the supervised
model. Moreover, experiments demonstrate that accuracy with DPO training
improves with more unlabeled data, indicating that a large pool of unlabeled
samples can be effectively leveraged to improve performance.

Conclusion: T2VParser在保留预训练模型知识的同时，提升了文本与视频的精确对齐能力。

Abstract: Text-to-video retrieval essentially aims to train models to align visual
content with textual descriptions accurately. Due to the impressive general
multimodal knowledge demonstrated by image-text pretrained models such as CLIP,
existing work has primarily focused on extending CLIP knowledge for video-text
tasks. However, videos typically contain richer information than images. In
current video-text datasets, textual descriptions can only reflect a portion of
the video content, leading to partial misalignment in video-text matching.
Therefore, directly aligning text representations with video representations
can result in incorrect supervision, ignoring the inequivalence of information.
In this work, we propose T2VParser to extract multiview semantic
representations from text and video, achieving adaptive semantic alignment
rather than aligning the entire representation. To extract corresponding
representations from different modalities, we introduce Adaptive Decomposition
Tokens, which consist of a set of learnable tokens shared across modalities.
The goal of T2VParser is to emphasize precise alignment between text and video
while retaining the knowledge of pretrained models. Experimental results
demonstrate that T2VParser achieves accurate partial alignment through
effective cross-modal content decomposition. The code is available at

TL;DR: DeepJIVE是一种基于深度学习的多模态数据集成方法，解决了传统方法无法处理高维数据和非线性结构的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多模态数据集成方法在处理高维数据和非线性结构时存在不足，需要一种更强大的工具。

Method: 提出DeepJIVE方法，通过数学推导和实验验证（合成及真实1D、2D、3D数据集），探索了三种可行的损失函数。

Result: DeepJIVE成功揭示了多模态数据的联合和独立变异，并在ADNI数据中发现了生物学上合理的协变模式。

Conclusion: DeepJIVE是多模态数据分析的有用工具。

Abstract: Conventional multimodal data integration methods provide a comprehensive
assessment of the shared or unique structure within each individual data type
but suffer from several limitations such as the inability to handle
high-dimensional data and identify nonlinear structures. In this paper, we
introduce DeepJIVE, a deep-learning approach to performing Joint and Individual
Variance Explained (JIVE). We perform mathematical derivation and experimental
validations using both synthetic and real-world 1D, 2D, and 3D datasets.
Different strategies of achieving the identity and orthogonality constraints
for DeepJIVE were explored, resulting in three viable loss functions. We found
that DeepJIVE can successfully uncover joint and individual variations of
multimodal datasets. Our application of DeepJIVE to the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) also identified biologically plausible
covariation patterns between the amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) and
magnetic resonance (MR) images. In conclusion, the proposed DeepJIVE can be a
useful tool for multimodal data analysis.

Result: 生成数据一致且上下文相关的预测掩码，提供可解释的多样化实例预测。

Conclusion: Co-Win框架显著提升了自动驾驶系统的场景分解和理解能力，支持更优的下游决策和规划。

Abstract: Accurate perception and scene understanding in complex urban environments is
a critical challenge for ensuring safe and efficient autonomous navigation. In
this paper, we present Co-Win, a novel bird's eye view (BEV) perception
framework that integrates point cloud encoding with efficient parallel
window-based feature extraction to address the multi-modality inherent in
environmental understanding. Our method employs a hierarchical architecture
comprising a specialized encoder, a window-based backbone, and a query-based
decoder head to effectively capture diverse spatial features and object
relationships. Unlike prior approaches that treat perception as a simple
regression task, our framework incorporates a variational approach with
mask-based instance segmentation, enabling fine-grained scene decomposition and
understanding. The Co-Win architecture processes point cloud data through
progressive feature extraction stages, ensuring that predicted masks are both
data-consistent and contextually relevant. Furthermore, our method produces
interpretable and diverse instance predictions, enabling enhanced downstream
decision-making and planning in autonomous driving systems.

TL;DR: ReSoRA提出了一种自适应正则化低秩适应子空间冗余的方法，显著提升了参数高效迁移学习的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有低秩适应方法在训练过程中投影矩阵不受限制，导致表示冗余和特征适应效果下降。现有解决方案缺乏灵活性和泛化能力。

Method: ReSoRA通过理论分解低秩子矩阵为多个等价子空间，并系统地对不同投影的特征分布应用去冗余约束。

Result: 实验表明，ReSoRA在多种骨干网络和数据集上提升了现有参数高效迁移学习方法的性能。

Conclusion: ReSoRA作为一种训练监督方法，可以无缝集成到现有方法中，且无需额外推理成本。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and its variants have delivered strong capability
in Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning (PETL) by minimizing trainable
parameters and benefiting from reparameterization. However, their projection
matrices remain unrestricted during training, causing high representation
redundancy and diminishing the effectiveness of feature adaptation in the
resulting subspaces. While existing methods mitigate this by manually adjusting
the rank or implicitly applying channel-wise masks, they lack flexibility and
generalize poorly across various datasets and architectures. Hence, we propose
ReSoRA, a method that explicitly models redundancy between mapping subspaces
and adaptively Regularizes Subspace redundancy of Low-Rank Adaptation.
Specifically, it theoretically decomposes the low-rank submatrices into
multiple equivalent subspaces and systematically applies de-redundancy
constraints to the feature distributions across different projections.
Extensive experiments validate that our proposed method consistently
facilitates existing state-of-the-art PETL methods across various backbones and
datasets in vision-language retrieval and standard visual classification
benchmarks. Besides, as a training supervision, ReSoRA can be seamlessly
integrated into existing approaches in a plug-and-play manner, with no
additional inference costs. Code is publicly available at:

Motivation: 合成人脸检测器的偏见问题可能导致对某些人口群体的检测失败，引发社会、法律和伦理问题。

Method: 利用合成数据生成和均匀分布的属性标签构建评估框架，分析五种检测器在25种面部属性上的偏见。

Result: 研究发现合成人脸检测器普遍存在对特定面部属性的偏见，并揭示了偏见与训练集属性平衡及检测器激活图的相关性。

Conclusion: 研究强调了偏见分析的紧迫性，并提供了减少偏见的潜在方法。

Abstract: Bias analysis for synthetic face detection is bound to become a critical
topic in the coming years. Although many detection models have been developed
and several datasets have been released to reliably identify synthetic content,
one crucial aspect has been largely overlooked: these models and training
datasets can be biased, leading to failures in detection for certain
demographic groups and raising significant social, legal, and ethical issues.
In this work, we introduce an evaluation framework to contribute to the
analysis of bias of synthetic face detectors with respect to several facial
attributes. This framework exploits synthetic data generation, with evenly
distributed attribute labels, for mitigating any skew in the data that could
otherwise influence the outcomes of bias analysis. We build on the proposed
framework to provide an extensive case study of the bias level of five
state-of-the-art detectors in synthetic datasets with 25 controlled facial
attributes. While the results confirm that, in general, synthetic face
detectors are biased towards the presence/absence of specific facial
attributes, our study also sheds light on the origins of the observed bias
through the analysis of the correlations with the balancing of facial
attributes in the training sets of the detectors, and the analysis of detectors
activation maps in image pairs with controlled attribute modifications.

Motivation: 解决四元数奇异值分解（QSVD）在彩色视频处理中的高计算成本和低效问题，同时提升移动目标检测和背景恢复的性能。

Method: 利用四元数黎曼流形降低QSVD计算复杂度至o(1)，提出uQRPCA框架平衡目标分割和背景恢复，并通过CR1B方法扩展为uQRPCA+以优化背景恢复。

Result: uQRPCA+在移动目标检测和背景恢复任务上达到了SOTA性能，显著优于现有开源方法。

Conclusion: 提出的uQRPCA+框架在计算效率和性能上均有显著提升，为彩色视频处理提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Moving target detection is a challenging computer vision task aimed at
generating accurate segmentation maps in diverse in-the-wild color videos
captured by static cameras. If backgrounds and targets can be simultaneously
extracted and recombined, such synthetic data can significantly enrich
annotated in-the-wild datasets and enhance the generalization ability of deep
models. Quaternion-based RPCA (QRPCA) is a promising unsupervised paradigm for
color image processing. However, in color video processing, Quaternion Singular
Value Decomposition (QSVD) incurs high computational costs, and rank-1
quaternion matrix fails to yield rank-1 color channels. In this paper, we
reduce the computational complexity of QSVD to o(1) by utilizing a quaternion
Riemannian manifold. Furthermor, we propose the universal QRPCA (uQRPCA)
framework, which achieves a balance in simultaneously segmenting targets and
recovering backgrounds from color videos. Moreover, we expand to uQRPCA+ by
introducing the Color Rank-1 Batch (CR1B) method to further process and obtain
the ideal low-rank background across color channels. Experiments demonstrate
our uQRPCA+ achieves State Of The Art (SOTA) performance on moving target
detection and background recovery tasks compared to existing open-source
methods. Our implementation is publicly available on GitHub at

Motivation: 研究LiDAR在RAFT-Stereo框架中的引导作用，解决稀疏LiDAR点云下引导效果急剧下降的问题。

Method: 提出预填充稀疏初始视差图的简单方法，并结合早期融合LiDAR深度的不同预填充策略。

Result: 提出的GRAFT-Stereo方法在稀疏LiDAR条件下显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 研究为LiDAR引导的立体匹配方法提供了新思路，有望激发更有效的技术发展。

Abstract: We investigate LiDAR guidance within the RAFT-Stereo framework, aiming to
improve stereo matching accuracy by injecting precise LiDAR depth into the
initial disparity map. We find that the effectiveness of LiDAR guidance
drastically degrades when the LiDAR points become sparse (e.g., a few hundred
points per frame), and we offer a novel explanation from a signal processing
perspective. This insight leads to a surprisingly simple solution that enables
LiDAR-guided RAFT-Stereo to thrive: pre-filling the sparse initial disparity
map with interpolation. Interestingly, we find that pre-filling is also
effective when injecting LiDAR depth into image features via early fusion, but
for a fundamentally different reason, necessitating a distinct pre-filling
approach. By combining both solutions, the proposed Guided RAFT-Stereo
(GRAFT-Stereo) significantly outperforms existing LiDAR-guided methods under
sparse LiDAR conditions across various datasets. We hope this study inspires
more effective LiDAR-guided stereo methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视频实例分割中对象长期跟踪的挑战，特别是在动态场景中对象频繁出现和消失的情况。

Method: 使用LOM显式建模对象在每帧中的存在状态，并结合DOA策略分别处理新出现和已存在的对象。

Result: 在YouTube-VIS 2022数据集上达到54.0的AP分数，表现优于传统方法。

Conclusion: LOMM通过创新的内存管理和对象关联策略，为视频实例分割设定了新的基准。

Abstract: In this paper, we present Latest Object Memory Management (LOMM) for
temporally consistent video instance segmentation that significantly improves
long-term instance tracking. At the core of our method is Latest Object Memory
(LOM), which robustly tracks and continuously updates the latest states of
objects by explicitly modeling their presence in each frame. This enables
consistent tracking and accurate identity management across frames, enhancing
both performance and reliability through the VIS process. Moreover, we
introduce Decoupled Object Association (DOA), a strategy that separately
handles newly appearing and already existing objects. By leveraging our memory
system, DOA accurately assigns object indices, improving matching accuracy and
ensuring stable identity consistency, even in dynamic scenes where objects
frequently appear and disappear. Extensive experiments and ablation studies
demonstrate the superiority of our method over traditional approaches, setting
a new benchmark in VIS. Notably, our LOMM achieves state-of-the-art AP score of
54.0 on YouTube-VIS 2022, a dataset known for its challenging long videos.

Motivation: 社交媒体上广泛使用的面部修饰引发了图像真实性的担忧，现有方法仅关注检测修饰，而恢复原始面部的问题尚未解决。

Method: 提出MoFRR模型，结合稀疏激活的专家处理特定修饰类型和共享专家处理通用修饰痕迹，采用双分支结构（低频和高频）优化恢复效果。

Result: 在RetouchingFFHQ++数据集上的实验表明，MoFRR在恢复原始面部方面表现优异。

Conclusion: MoFRR为面部修饰恢复任务提供了有效解决方案，解决了复杂修饰操作的挑战。

Abstract: The widespread use of face retouching on social media platforms raises
concerns about the authenticity of face images. While existing methods focus on
detecting face retouching, how to accurately recover the original faces from
the retouched ones has yet to be answered. This paper introduces Face
Retouching Restoration (FRR), a novel computer vision task aimed at restoring
original faces from their retouched counterparts. FRR differs from traditional
image restoration tasks by addressing the complex retouching operations with
various types and degrees, which focuses more on the restoration of the
low-frequency information of the faces. To tackle this challenge, we propose
MoFRR, Mixture of Diffusion Models for FRR. Inspired by DeepSeek's expert
isolation strategy, the MoFRR uses sparse activation of specialized experts
handling distinct retouching types and the engagement of a shared expert
dealing with universal retouching traces. Each specialized expert follows a
dual-branch structure with a DDIM-based low-frequency branch guided by an
Iterative Distortion Evaluation Module (IDEM) and a Cross-Attention-based
High-Frequency branch (HFCAM) for detail refinement. Extensive experiments on a
newly constructed face retouching dataset, RetouchingFFHQ++, demonstrate the
effectiveness of MoFRR for FRR.

Result: 自引导MAE显著提升了学习效果，无需依赖外部模型或额外信息，保持了自监督学习的优势。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在多种下游任务中验证了有效性，揭示了MAE的学习机制并改进了其性能。

Abstract: Masked Autoencoder (MAE) is a self-supervised approach for representation
learning, widely applicable to a variety of downstream tasks in computer
vision. In spite of its success, it is still not fully uncovered what and how
MAE exactly learns. In this paper, with an in-depth analysis, we discover that
MAE intrinsically learns pattern-based patch-level clustering from surprisingly
early stages of pretraining. Upon this understanding, we propose self-guided
masked autoencoder, which internally generates informed mask by utilizing its
progress in patch clustering, substituting the naive random masking of the
vanilla MAE. Our approach significantly boosts its learning process without
relying on any external models or supplementary information, keeping the
benefit of self-supervised nature of MAE intact. Comprehensive experiments on
various downstream tasks verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TL;DR: HydraMamba提出了一种基于状态空间模型的点云网络，通过改进点云序列化和局部学习，解决了现有注意力机制在点云学习中的长程依赖建模问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 注意力机制在点云学习中占主导地位，但其二次复杂度限制了点间交互和长程依赖建模。状态空间模型（S6）因其线性复杂度和优秀的长程建模能力被引入点云学习，但仍存在点云序列化不完善和局部学习不足的问题。

Method: 设计了shuffle序列化策略以适应S6的因果性；提出ConvBiS6层协同捕获局部几何和全局上下文依赖；扩展多头设计到S6（MHS6）增强建模能力。

Result: HydraMamba在对象级和场景级任务中均达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: HydraMamba通过改进序列化和局部学习，有效解决了点云学习中的长程依赖建模问题，展示了状态空间模型的潜力。

Abstract: The attention mechanism has become a dominant operator in point cloud
learning, but its quadratic complexity leads to limited inter-point
interactions, hindering long-range dependency modeling between objects. Due to
excellent long-range modeling capability with linear complexity, the selective
state space model (S6), as the core of Mamba, has been exploited in point cloud
learning for long-range dependency interactions over the entire point cloud.
Despite some significant progress, related works still suffer from imperfect
point cloud serialization and lack of locality learning. To this end, we
explore a state space model-based point cloud network termed HydraMamba to
address the above challenges. Specifically, we design a shuffle serialization
strategy, making unordered point sets better adapted to the causal nature of
S6. Meanwhile, to overcome the deficiency of existing techniques in locality
learning, we propose a ConvBiS6 layer, which is capable of capturing local
geometries and global context dependencies synergistically. Besides, we propose
MHS6 by extending the multi-head design to S6, further enhancing its modeling
capability. HydraMamba achieves state-of-the-art results on various tasks at
both object-level and scene-level. The code is available at

Result: 实验表明，JDATT在视觉恢复和检测精度上表现优异，同时显著减小模型规模和推理时间。

Conclusion: JDATT通过联合蒸馏实现了高效的大气湍流抑制和目标检测，适用于实时应用。

Abstract: Atmospheric turbulence (AT) introduces severe degradations, such as rippling,
blur, and intensity fluctuations, that hinder both image quality and downstream
vision tasks like target detection. While recent deep learning-based approaches
have advanced AT mitigation using transformer and Mamba architectures, their
high complexity and computational cost make them unsuitable for real-time
applications, especially in resource-constrained settings such as remote
surveillance. Moreover, the common practice of separating turbulence mitigation
and object detection leads to inefficiencies and suboptimal performance. To
address these challenges, we propose JDATT, a Joint Distillation framework for
Atmospheric Turbulence mitigation and Target detection. JDATT integrates
state-of-the-art AT mitigation and detection modules and introduces a unified
knowledge distillation strategy that compresses both components while
minimizing performance loss. We employ a hybrid distillation scheme:
feature-level distillation via Channel-Wise Distillation (CWD) and Masked
Generative Distillation (MGD), and output-level distillation via
Kullback-Leibler divergence. Experiments on synthetic and real-world turbulence
datasets demonstrate that JDATT achieves superior visual restoration and
detection accuracy while significantly reducing model size and inference time,
making it well-suited for real-time deployment.

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，验证了运动知识迁移的有效性。

Conclusion: TransFlow通过生成逼真训练数据，显著提升了视频显著目标检测的性能。

Abstract: Video salient object detection (SOD) relies on motion cues to distinguish
salient objects from backgrounds, but training such models is limited by scarce
video datasets compared to abundant image datasets. Existing approaches that
use spatial transformations to create video sequences from static images fail
for motion-guided tasks, as these transformations produce unrealistic optical
flows that lack semantic understanding of motion. We present TransFlow, which
transfers motion knowledge from pre-trained video diffusion models to generate
realistic training data for video SOD. Video diffusion models have learned rich
semantic motion priors from large-scale video data, understanding how different
objects naturally move in real scenes. TransFlow leverages this knowledge to
generate semantically-aware optical flows from static images, where objects
exhibit natural motion patterns while preserving spatial boundaries and
temporal coherence. Our method achieves improved performance across multiple
benchmarks, demonstrating effective motion knowledge transfer.

Conclusion: DepthFlow为数据稀缺问题提供了可扩展且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Unsupervised video object segmentation (VOS) aims to detect the most
prominent object in a video. Recently, two-stream approaches that leverage both
RGB images and optical flow have gained significant attention, but their
performance is fundamentally constrained by the scarcity of training data. To
address this, we propose DepthFlow, a novel data generation method that
synthesizes optical flow from single images. Our approach is driven by the key
insight that VOS models depend more on structural information embedded in flow
maps than on their geometric accuracy, and that this structure is highly
correlated with depth. We first estimate a depth map from a source image and
then convert it into a synthetic flow field that preserves essential structural
cues. This process enables the transformation of large-scale image-mask pairs
into image-flow-mask training pairs, dramatically expanding the data available
for network training. By training a simple encoder-decoder architecture with
our synthesized data, we achieve new state-of-the-art performance on all public
VOS benchmarks, demonstrating a scalable and effective solution to the data
scarcity problem.

Result: 通过精心设计的架构，机器学习算法可以变得更高效、更小、更快且更经济。

Conclusion: 优化神经网络架构设计是提升模型效率的关键，能够在减少资源消耗的同时保持高性能。

Abstract: Major advancements in the capabilities of computer vision models have been
primarily fueled by rapid expansion of datasets, model parameters, and
computational budgets, leading to ever-increasing demands on computational
infrastructure. However, as these models are deployed in increasingly diverse
and resource-constrained environments, there is a pressing need for
architectures that can deliver high performance while requiring fewer
computational resources.
  This dissertation focuses on architectural principles through which models
can achieve increased performance while reducing their computational demands.
We discuss strides towards this goal through three directions. First, we focus
on data ingress and egress, investigating how information may be passed into
and retrieved from our core neural processing units. This ensures that our
models make the most of available data, allowing smaller architectures to
become more performant. Second, we investigate modifications to the core neural
architecture, applied to restricted attention in vision transformers. This
section explores how removing uniform context windows in restricted attention
increases the expressivity of the underlying neural architecture. Third, we
explore the natural structures of Normalizing Flows and how we can leverage
these properties to better distill model knowledge.
  These contributions demonstrate that careful design of neural architectures
can increase the efficiency of machine learning algorithms, allowing them to
become smaller, faster, and cheaper.

Abstract: Document image rectification aims to eliminate geometric deformation in
photographed documents to facilitate text recognition. However, existing
methods often neglect the significance of foreground elements, which provide
essential geometric references and layout information for document image
correction. In this paper, we introduce Foreground-Centric Network (ForCenNet)
to eliminate geometric distortions in document images. Specifically, we
initially propose a foreground-centric label generation method, which extracts
detailed foreground elements from an undistorted image. Then we introduce a
foreground-centric mask mechanism to enhance the distinction between readable
and background regions. Furthermore, we design a curvature consistency loss to
leverage the detailed foreground labels to help the model understand the
distorted geometric distribution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
ForCenNet achieves new state-of-the-art on four real-world benchmarks, such as
DocUNet, DIR300, WarpDoc, and DocReal. Quantitative analysis shows that the

### [162] [DS-Det: Single-Query Paradigm and Attention Disentangled Learning for Flexible Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19807)
*Guiping Cao,Xiangyuan Lan,Wenjian Huang,Jianguo Zhang,Dongmei Jiang,Yaowei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DS-Det提出了一种新的单查询范式，解决了固定查询的灵活性问题，并通过注意力解耦学习提高了解码器效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有解码器查询类型（如内容查询和位置查询）的作用尚未充分探索，固定查询限制了灵活性，且存在循环对立交互（ROT）和查询模糊性问题。

Method: 引入单查询范式，将固定查询转为灵活查询；通过注意力解耦学习简化解码器框架，分别处理定位和去重；提出PoCoo损失函数优化小目标学习。

Result: 在COCO2017和WiderPerson数据集上，DS-Det在五种不同骨干模型上表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: DS-Det通过灵活查询和注意力解耦学习，有效解决了ROT和查询模糊性问题，提升了检测效率和性能。

Abstract: Popular transformer detectors have achieved promising performance through
query-based learning using attention mechanisms. However, the roles of existing
decoder query types (e.g., content query and positional query) are still
underexplored. These queries are generally predefined with a fixed number
(fixed-query), which limits their flexibility. We find that the learning of
these fixed-query is impaired by Recurrent Opposing inTeractions (ROT) between
two attention operations: Self-Attention (query-to-query) and Cross-Attention
(query-to-encoder), thereby degrading decoder efficiency. Furthermore, "query
ambiguity" arises when shared-weight decoder layers are processed with both
one-to-one and one-to-many label assignments during training, violating DETR's
one-to-one matching principle. To address these challenges, we propose DS-Det,
a more efficient detector capable of detecting a flexible number of objects in
images. Specifically, we reformulate and introduce a new unified Single-Query
paradigm for decoder modeling, transforming the fixed-query into flexible.
Furthermore, we propose a simplified decoder framework through attention
disentangled learning: locating boxes with Cross-Attention (one-to-many
process), deduplicating predictions with Self-Attention (one-to-one process),
addressing "query ambiguity" and "ROT" issues directly, and enhancing decoder
efficiency. We further introduce a unified PoCoo loss that leverages box size
priors to prioritize query learning on hard samples such as small objects.
Extensive experiments across five different backbone models on COCO2017 and
WiderPerson datasets demonstrate the general effectiveness and superiority of
DS-Det. The source codes are available at

Result: SeeDiff直接从Stable Diffusion生成高质量掩码，无需额外训练或提示调优。

Conclusion: SeeDiff展示了文本引导扩散模型在像素级标注任务中的潜力，为自动化标注提供了新思路。

Abstract: Entrusted with the goal of pixel-level object classification, the semantic
segmentation networks entail the laborious preparation of pixel-level
annotation masks. To obtain pixel-level annotation masks for a given class
without human efforts, recent few works have proposed to generate pairs of
images and annotation masks by employing image and text relationships modeled
by text-to-image generative models, especially Stable Diffusion. However, these
works do not fully exploit the capability of text-guided Diffusion models and
thus require a pre-trained segmentation network, careful text prompt tuning, or
the training of a segmentation network to generate final annotation masks. In
this work, we take a closer look at attention mechanisms of Stable Diffusion,
from which we draw connections with classical seeded segmentation approaches.
In particular, we show that cross-attention alone provides very coarse object
localization, which however can provide initial seeds. Then, akin to region
expansion in seeded segmentation, we utilize the
semantic-correspondence-modeling capability of self-attention to iteratively
spread the attention to the whole class from the seeds using multi-scale
self-attention maps. We also observe that a simple-text-guided synthetic image
often has a uniform background, which is easier to find correspondences,
compared to complex-structured objects. Thus, we further refine a mask using a
more accurate background mask. Our proposed method, dubbed SeeDiff, generates
high-quality masks off-the-shelf from Stable Diffusion, without additional
training procedure, prompt tuning, or a pre-trained segmentation network.

TL;DR: FM-LC框架通过多阶段方法提升干旱地区城市洪水测绘精度，显著优于传统单阶段U-Net方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 干旱地区城市洪水对基础设施和社区构成严重风险，需高精度洪水测绘以改进应急响应和韧性规划。

Method: FM-LC采用三阶段流程：多类U-Net初始分割、轻量级二元专家模型修正误分类、贝叶斯平滑优化边界。

Result: 在2024年迪拜风暴事件中验证，平均F1分数提升29%，洪水边界更清晰。

Conclusion: FM-LC框架有效解决了干旱地区洪水测绘的挑战，显著提升精度。

Abstract: Urban flooding in arid regions poses severe risks to infrastructure and
communities. Accurate, fine-scale mapping of flood extents and recovery
trajectories is therefore essential for improving emergency response and
resilience planning. However, arid environments often exhibit limited spectral
contrast between water and adjacent surfaces, rapid hydrological dynamics, and
highly heterogeneous urban land covers, which challenge traditional
flood-mapping approaches. High-resolution, daily PlanetScope imagery provides
the temporal and spatial detail needed. In this work, we introduce FM-LC, a
hierarchical framework for Flood Mapping by Land Cover identification, for this
challenging task. Through a three-stage process, it first uses an initial
multi-class U-Net to segment imagery into water, vegetation, built area, and
bare ground classes. We identify that this method has confusion between
spectrally similar categories (e.g., water vs. vegetation). Second, by early
checking, the class with the major misclassified area is flagged, and a
lightweight binary expert segmentation model is trained to distinguish the
flagged class from the rest. Third, a Bayesian smoothing step refines
boundaries and removes spurious noise by leveraging nearby pixel information.
We validate the framework on the April 2024 Dubai storm event, using pre- and
post-rainfall PlanetScope composites. Experimental results demonstrate average
F1-score improvements of up to 29% across all land-cover classes and notably
sharper flood delineations, significantly outperforming conventional
single-stage U-Net baselines.

TL;DR: AutoSign是一种自回归解码器转换器，直接翻译姿态序列为自然语言文本，避免了传统对齐机制，显著提升了连续手语识别的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统连续手语识别方法中多阶段流程导致的错误传播、过拟合和词汇扩展瓶颈问题。

Method: 使用1D CNN进行时间压缩，结合预训练的AraGPT2解码器，直接生成文本（glosses）。

Result: 在Isharah-1000数据集上，WER分数提升了6.1%。

Conclusion: AutoSign通过消除多阶段流程，显著提升了连续手语识别的性能，且手势和身体姿态提供了最具区分性的特征。

Abstract: Continuously recognizing sign gestures and converting them to glosses plays a
key role in bridging the gap between the hearing and hearing-impaired
communities. This involves recognizing and interpreting the hands, face, and
body gestures of the signer, which pose a challenge as it involves a
combination of all these features. Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR)
methods rely on multi-stage pipelines that first extract visual features, then
align variable-length sequences with target glosses using CTC or HMM-based
approaches. However, these alignment-based methods suffer from error
propagation across stages, overfitting, and struggle with vocabulary
scalability due to the intermediate gloss representation bottleneck. To address
these limitations, we propose AutoSign, an autoregressive decoder-only
transformer that directly translates pose sequences to natural language text,
bypassing traditional alignment mechanisms entirely. The use of this
decoder-only approach allows the model to directly map between the features and
the glosses without the need for CTC loss while also directly learning the
textual dependencies in the glosses. Our approach incorporates a temporal
compression module using 1D CNNs to efficiently process pose sequences,
followed by AraGPT2, a pre-trained Arabic decoder, to generate text (glosses).
Through comprehensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that hand and body
gestures provide the most discriminative features for signer-independent CSLR.
By eliminating the multi-stage pipeline, AutoSign achieves substantial
improvements on the Isharah-1000 dataset, achieving an improvement of up to
6.1\% in WER score compared to the best existing method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为KR-NFT的新方法，通过负特征调优和知识正则化策略，提升视觉语言模型的OOD检测能力，同时保持对未见类和风格的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决负提示调优在OOD检测中导致的泛化性能下降问题。

Method: 结合负特征调优（NFT）和知识正则化（KR）策略，动态适应图像并分离正负特征。

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上，KR-NFT显著降低了FPR95，并提升了ID分类和OOD检测性能。

Conclusion: KR-NFT在OOD检测和泛化性能上优于传统方法，适用于未见ID类别的场景。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for building reliable machine
learning models. Although negative prompt tuning has enhanced the OOD detection
capabilities of vision-language models, these tuned models often suffer from
reduced generalization performance on unseen classes and styles. To address
this challenge, we propose a novel method called Knowledge Regularized Negative
Feature Tuning (KR-NFT), which integrates an innovative adaptation architecture
termed Negative Feature Tuning (NFT) and a corresponding
knowledge-regularization (KR) optimization strategy. Specifically, NFT applies
distribution-aware transformations to pre-trained text features, effectively
separating positive and negative features into distinct spaces. This separation
maximizes the distinction between in-distribution (ID) and OOD images.
Additionally, we introduce image-conditional learnable factors through a
lightweight meta-network, enabling dynamic adaptation to individual images and
mitigating sensitivity to class and style shifts. Compared to traditional
negative prompt tuning, NFT demonstrates superior efficiency and scalability.
To optimize this adaptation architecture, the KR optimization strategy is
designed to enhance the discrimination between ID and OOD sets while mitigating
pre-trained knowledge forgetting. This enhances OOD detection performance on
trained ID classes while simultaneously improving OOD detection on unseen ID
datasets. Notably, when trained with few-shot samples from ImageNet dataset,
KR-NFT not only improves ID classification accuracy and OOD detection but also
significantly reduces the FPR95 by 5.44\% under an unexplored generalization
setting with unseen ID categories. Codes can be found at

Abstract: Generating realistic human motions from textual descriptions has undergone
significant advancements. However, existing methods often overlook specific
body part movements and their timing. In this paper, we address this issue by
enriching the textual description with more details. Specifically, we propose
the FineMotion dataset, which contains over 442,000 human motion snippets -
short segments of human motion sequences - and their corresponding detailed
descriptions of human body part movements. Additionally, the dataset includes
about 95k detailed paragraphs describing the movements of human body parts of
entire motion sequences. Experimental results demonstrate the significance of
our dataset on the text-driven finegrained human motion generation task,
especially with a remarkable +15.3% improvement in Top-3 accuracy for the MDM
model. Notably, we further support a zero-shot pipeline of fine-grained motion
editing, which focuses on detailed editing in both spatial and temporal
dimensions via text. Dataset and code available at: CVI-SZU/FineMotion

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SAMA的结构感知和运动自适应框架，用于姿态提升任务，通过独立建模空间关节拓扑和运动动态，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以建模复杂的关节连接和统一的运动轨迹处理，忽视了运动特性的内在差异。

Method: SAMA框架包含结构感知状态整合器（SSI）和运动自适应状态调制器（MSM），分别处理关节拓扑和运动特性。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现出先进性能，且计算成本更低。

Conclusion: SAMA框架通过结构感知和运动自适应设计，显著提升了姿态提升任务的性能。

Abstract: Recent Mamba-based methods for the pose-lifting task tend to model joint
dependencies by 2D-to-1D mapping with diverse scanning strategies. Though
effective, they struggle to model intricate joint connections and uniformly
process all joint motion trajectories while neglecting the intrinsic
differences across motion characteristics. In this work, we propose a
structure-aware and motion-adaptive framework to capture spatial joint topology
along with diverse motion dynamics independently, named as SAMA. Specifically,
SAMA consists of a Structure-aware State Integrator (SSI) and a Motion-adaptive
State Modulator (MSM). The Structure-aware State Integrator is tasked with
leveraging dynamic joint relationships to fuse information at both the joint
feature and state levels in the state space, based on pose topology rather than
sequential state transitions. The Motion-adaptive State Modulator is
responsible for joint-specific motion characteristics recognition, thus
applying tailored adjustments to diverse motion patterns across different
joints. Through the above key modules, our algorithm enables structure-aware
and motion-adaptive pose lifting. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our algorithm achieves advanced results with fewer
computational costs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有融合方法在场景理解或网格结构上的局限性。

Method: 采用级联流程：FLI初始化高斯位置，IMA融合语义和几何信息，MGF生成多级BEV特征。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: RaGS通过动态聚焦稀疏目标，提供高效且全面的场景感知。

Abstract: 4D millimeter-wave radar has emerged as a promising sensor for autonomous
driving, but effective 3D object detection from both 4D radar and monocular
images remains a challenge. Existing fusion approaches typically rely on either
instance-based proposals or dense BEV grids, which either lack holistic scene
understanding or are limited by rigid grid structures. To address these, we
propose RaGS, the first framework to leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) as
representation for fusing 4D radar and monocular cues in 3D object detection.
3D GS naturally suits 3D object detection by modeling the scene as a field of
Gaussians, dynamically allocating resources on foreground objects and providing
a flexible, resource-efficient solution. RaGS uses a cascaded pipeline to
construct and refine the Gaussian field. It starts with the Frustum-based
Localization Initiation (FLI), which unprojects foreground pixels to initialize
coarse 3D Gaussians positions. Then, the Iterative Multimodal Aggregation (IMA)
fuses semantics and geometry, refining the limited Gaussians to the regions of
interest. Finally, the Multi-level Gaussian Fusion (MGF) renders the Gaussians
into multi-level BEV features for 3D object detection. By dynamically focusing
on sparse objects within scenes, RaGS enable object concentrating while
offering comprehensive scene perception. Extensive experiments on
View-of-Delft, TJ4DRadSet, and OmniHD-Scenes benchmarks demonstrate its
state-of-the-art performance. Code will be released.

Motivation: 传统开放世界目标检测方法依赖大量标注数据且易过拟合，OW-CLIP旨在通过数据高效训练和可视化工具解决这些问题。

Method: 采用多模态提示调优和Crop-Smoothing技术，结合双模态数据精炼方法，利用大语言模型和跨模态相似性生成和过滤数据。

Result: OW-CLIP仅需3.8%的自生成数据即可达到89%的SOTA性能，且在数据量相同时优于现有方法。

Conclusion: OW-CLIP通过数据高效训练和可视化工具，显著提升了开放世界目标检测的性能和灵活性。

Abstract: Open-world object detection (OWOD) extends traditional object detection to
identifying both known and unknown object, necessitating continuous model
adaptation as new annotations emerge. Current approaches face significant
limitations: 1) data-hungry training due to reliance on a large number of
crowdsourced annotations, 2) susceptibility to "partial feature overfitting,"
and 3) limited flexibility due to required model architecture modifications. To
tackle these issues, we present OW-CLIP, a visual analytics system that
provides curated data and enables data-efficient OWOD model incremental
training. OW-CLIP implements plug-and-play multimodal prompt tuning tailored
for OWOD settings and introduces a novel "Crop-Smoothing" technique to mitigate
partial feature overfitting. To meet the data requirements for the training
methodology, we propose dual-modal data refinement methods that leverage large
language models and cross-modal similarity for data generation and filtering.
Simultaneously, we develope a visualization interface that enables users to
explore and deliver high-quality annotations: including class-specific visual
feature phrases and fine-grained differentiated images. Quantitative evaluation
demonstrates that OW-CLIP achieves competitive performance at 89% of
state-of-the-art performance while requiring only 3.8% self-generated data,
while outperforming SOTA approach when trained with equivalent data volumes. A
case study shows the effectiveness of the developed method and the improved
annotation quality of our visualization system.

Conclusion: DiffCode通过任务自适应码本库和潜在扩散策略，成功解决了多任务MedIR中的异构性问题，实现了高性能的图像恢复。

Abstract: All-in-one medical image restoration (MedIR) aims to address multiple MedIR
tasks using a unified model, concurrently recovering various high-quality (HQ)
medical images (e.g., MRI, CT, and PET) from low-quality (LQ) counterparts.
However, all-in-one MedIR presents significant challenges due to the
heterogeneity across different tasks. Each task involves distinct degradations,
leading to diverse information losses in LQ images. Existing methods struggle
to handle these diverse information losses associated with different tasks. To
address these challenges, we propose a latent diffusion-enhanced
vector-quantized codebook prior and develop \textbf{DiffCode}, a novel
framework leveraging this prior for all-in-one MedIR. Specifically, to
compensate for diverse information losses associated with different tasks,
DiffCode constructs a task-adaptive codebook bank to integrate task-specific HQ
prior features across tasks, capturing a comprehensive prior. Furthermore, to
enhance prior retrieval from the codebook bank, DiffCode introduces a latent
diffusion strategy that utilizes the diffusion model's powerful mapping
capabilities to iteratively refine the latent feature distribution, estimating
more accurate HQ prior features during restoration. With the help of the
task-adaptive codebook bank and latent diffusion strategy, DiffCode achieves
superior performance in both quantitative metrics and visual quality across
three MedIR tasks: MRI super-resolution, CT denoising, and PET synthesis.

Conclusion: ATCTrack通过动态对齐多模态线索和特征建模，显著提升了跟踪性能。

Abstract: Vision-language tracking aims to locate the target object in the video
sequence using a template patch and a language description provided in the
initial frame. To achieve robust tracking, especially in complex long-term
scenarios that reflect real-world conditions as recently highlighted by MGIT,
it is essential not only to characterize the target features but also to
utilize the context features related to the target. However, the visual and
textual target-context cues derived from the initial prompts generally align
only with the initial target state. Due to their dynamic nature, target states
are constantly changing, particularly in complex long-term sequences. It is
intractable for these cues to continuously guide Vision-Language Trackers
(VLTs). Furthermore, for the text prompts with diverse expressions, our
experiments reveal that existing VLTs struggle to discern which words pertain
to the target or the context, complicating the utilization of textual cues. In
this work, we present a novel tracker named ATCTrack, which can obtain
multimodal cues Aligned with the dynamic target states through comprehensive
Target-Context feature modeling, thereby achieving robust tracking.
Specifically, (1) for the visual modality, we propose an effective temporal
visual target-context modeling approach that provides the tracker with timely
visual cues. (2) For the textual modality, we achieve precise target words
identification solely based on textual content, and design an innovative
context words calibration method to adaptively utilize auxiliary context words.
(3) We conduct extensive experiments on mainstream benchmarks and ATCTrack
achieves a new SOTA performance. The code and models will be released at:

Abstract: This work introduces a self-supervised neuro-analytical, cost efficient,
model for visual-based quadrotor control in which a small 1.7M parameters
student ConvNet learns automatically from an analytical teacher, an improved
image-based visual servoing (IBVS) controller. Our IBVS system solves numerical
instabilities by reducing the classical visual servoing equations and enabling
efficient stable image feature detection. Through knowledge distillation, the
student model achieves 11x faster inference compared to the teacher IBVS
pipeline, while demonstrating similar control accuracy at a significantly lower
computational and memory cost. Our vision-only self-supervised neuro-analytic
control, enables quadrotor orientation and movement without requiring explicit
geometric models or fiducial markers. The proposed methodology leverages
simulation-to-reality transfer learning and is validated on a small drone
platform in GPS-denied indoor environments. Our key contributions include: (1)
an analytical IBVS teacher that solves numerical instabilities inherent in
classical approaches, (2) a two-stage segmentation pipeline combining YOLOv11
with a U-Net-based mask splitter for robust anterior-posterior vehicle
segmentation to correctly estimate the orientation of the target, and (3) an
efficient knowledge distillation dual-path system, which transfers geometric
visual servoing capabilities from the analytical IBVS teacher to a compact and

Conclusion: FedS2R在联邦学习下有效实现了合成到真实语义分割。

Abstract: Federated domain generalization has shown promising progress in image
classification by enabling collaborative training across multiple clients
without sharing raw data. However, its potential in the semantic segmentation
of autonomous driving remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose FedS2R,
the first one-shot federated domain generalization framework for
synthetic-to-real semantic segmentation in autonomous driving. FedS2R comprises
two components: an inconsistency-driven data augmentation strategy that
generates images for unstable classes, and a multi-client knowledge
distillation scheme with feature fusion that distills a global model from
multiple client models. Experiments on five real-world datasets, Cityscapes,
BDD100K, Mapillary, IDD, and ACDC, show that the global model significantly
outperforms individual client models and is only 2 mIoU points behind the model
trained with simultaneous access to all client data. These results demonstrate
the effectiveness of FedS2R in synthetic-to-real semantic segmentation for
autonomous driving under federated learning

Motivation: 解决视觉-语言Transformer中目标定位能力不足的问题，尤其是语义相关但被抑制的token对预测的贡献不足。

Method: RCA通过抑制极端值并放大中等激活值，重新加权最终层注意力，使语义相关但被抑制的token能够指导预测。

Conclusion: RCA为多模态Transformer提供了可解释性和性能提升，揭示了模型容量和解耦能力的关键作用。

Abstract: We propose Reverse Contrast Attention (RCA), a plug-in method that enhances
object localization in vision-language transformers without retraining. RCA
reweights final-layer attention by suppressing extremes and amplifying
mid-level activations to let semantically relevant but subdued tokens guide
predictions. We evaluate it on Open Vocabulary Referring Object Detection
(OV-RefOD), introducing FitAP, a confidence-free average precision metric based
on IoU and box area. RCA improves FitAP in 11 out of 15 open-source VLMs, with
gains up to $+26.6\%$. Effectiveness aligns with attention sharpness and fusion

Motivation: 解决现有类别特定方法在实际应用中的不实用性，如需要多个模型和泛化能力有限。

Result: 在三个常用基准测试中达到最先进性能，展示强泛化能力和竞争力。

Conclusion: TrackAny3D为统一模型的重要性提供了启示，并推动大规模预训练模型在该领域的应用。

Abstract: 3D LiDAR-based single object tracking (SOT) relies on sparse and irregular
point clouds, posing challenges from geometric variations in scale, motion
patterns, and structural complexity across object categories. Current
category-specific approaches achieve good accuracy but are impractical for
real-world use, requiring separate models for each category and showing limited
generalization. To tackle these issues, we propose TrackAny3D, the first
framework to transfer large-scale pretrained 3D models for category-agnostic 3D
SOT. We first integrate parameter-efficient adapters to bridge the gap between
pretraining and tracking tasks while preserving geometric priors. Then, we
introduce a Mixture-of-Geometry-Experts (MoGE) architecture that adaptively
activates specialized subnetworks based on distinct geometric characteristics.
Additionally, we design a temporal context optimization strategy that
incorporates learnable temporal tokens and a dynamic mask weighting module to
propagate historical information and mitigate temporal drift. Experiments on
three commonly-used benchmarks show that TrackAny3D establishes new
state-of-the-art performance on category-agnostic 3D SOT, demonstrating strong
generalization and competitiveness. We hope this work will enlighten the
community on the importance of unified models and further expand the use of
large-scale pretrained models in this field.

Result: 在COIL100和ORL数据集上表现优于其他先进方法，且性能接近全批处理方法。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了深度子空间聚类的可扩展性和效率，同时保持了高性能。

Abstract: Mini-batch training is a cornerstone of modern deep learning, offering
computational efficiency and scalability for training complex architectures.
However, existing deep subspace clustering (DSC) methods, which typically
combine an autoencoder with a self-expressive layer, rely on full-batch
processing. The bottleneck arises from the self-expressive module, which
requires representations of the entire dataset to construct a
self-representation coefficient matrix. In this work, we introduce a mini-batch
training strategy for DSC by integrating a memory bank that preserves global
feature representations. Our approach enables scalable training of deep
architectures for subspace clustering with high-resolution images, overcoming
previous limitations. Additionally, to efficiently fine-tune large-scale
pre-trained encoders for subspace clustering, we propose a decoder-free
framework that leverages contrastive learning instead of autoencoding for
representation learning. This design not only eliminates the computational
overhead of decoder training but also provides competitive performance.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach not only achieves
performance comparable to full-batch methods, but outperforms other
state-of-the-art subspace clustering methods on the COIL100 and ORL datasets by
fine-tuning deep networks.

Conclusion: HumanSAM通过细粒度分类和特征融合，提升了伪造视频检测的可靠性和实用性。

Abstract: Numerous synthesized videos from generative models, especially human-centric
ones that simulate realistic human actions, pose significant threats to human
information security and authenticity. While progress has been made in binary
forgery video detection, the lack of fine-grained understanding of forgery
types raises concerns regarding both reliability and interpretability, which
are critical for real-world applications. To address this limitation, we
propose HumanSAM, a new framework that builds upon the fundamental challenges
of video generation models. Specifically, HumanSAM aims to classify
human-centric forgeries into three distinct types of artifacts commonly
observed in generated content: spatial, appearance, and motion anomaly.To
better capture the features of geometry, semantics and spatiotemporal
consistency, we propose to generate the human forgery representation by fusing
two branches of video understanding and spatial depth. We also adopt a
rank-based confidence enhancement strategy during the training process to learn
more robust representation by introducing three prior scores. For training and
evaluation, we construct the first public benchmark, the Human-centric Forgery
Video (HFV) dataset, with all types of forgeries carefully annotated
semi-automatically. In our experiments, HumanSAM yields promising results in
comparison with state-of-the-art methods, both in binary and multi-class
forgery classification.

Conclusion: MambaVesselNet++通过结合CNN和Mamba模型，实现了高效且准确的医学图像分割。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays an important role in computer-aided
diagnosis. Traditional convolution-based U-shape segmentation architectures are
usually limited by the local receptive field. Existing vision transformers have
been widely applied to diverse medical segmentation frameworks due to their
superior capabilities of capturing global contexts. Despite the advantage, the
real-world application of vision transformers is challenged by their non-linear
self-attention mechanism, requiring huge computational costs. To address this
issue, the selective state space model (SSM) Mamba has gained recognition for
its adeptness in modeling long-range dependencies in sequential data,
particularly noted for its efficient memory costs. In this paper, we propose
MambaVesselNet++, a Hybrid CNN-Mamba framework for medical image segmentation.
Our MambaVesselNet++ is comprised of a hybrid image encoder (Hi-Encoder) and a
bifocal fusion decoder (BF-Decoder). In Hi-Encoder, we first devise the
texture-aware layer to capture low-level semantic features by leveraging
convolutions. Then, we utilize Mamba to effectively model long-range
dependencies with linear complexity. The Bi-Decoder adopts skip connections to
combine local and global information of the Hi-Encoder for the accurate
generation of segmentation masks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MambaVesselNet++ outperforms current convolution-based, transformer-based, and
Mamba-based state-of-the-arts across diverse medical 2D, 3D, and instance
segmentation tasks. The code is available at

Result: LLM_Control在多种预训练T2I模型中表现出色，合成质量优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LLM_Control显著提升了复杂输入条件下的图像生成能力，为可控T2I生成任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent spatial control methods for text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have
shown compelling results. However, these methods still fail to precisely follow
the control conditions and generate the corresponding images, especially when
encountering the textual prompts that contain multiple objects or have complex
spatial compositions. In this work, we present a LLM-guided framework called
LLM\_Control to address the challenges of the controllable T2I generation task.
By improving grounding capabilities, LLM\_Control is introduced to accurately
modulate the pre-trained diffusion models, where visual conditions and textual
prompts influence the structures and appearance generation in a complementary
way. We utilize the multimodal LLM as a global controller to arrange spatial
layouts, augment semantic descriptions and bind object attributes. The obtained
control signals are injected into the denoising network to refocus and enhance
attention maps according to novel sampling constraints. Extensive qualitative
and quantitative experiments have demonstrated that LLM\_Control achieves
competitive synthesis quality compared to other state-of-the-art methods across
various pre-trained T2I models. It is noteworthy that LLM\_Control allows the
challenging input conditions on which most of the existing methods

Conclusion: UniCT Depth通过有效融合事件和图像数据，解决了现有方法的局限性，提升了深度估计性能。

Abstract: Depth estimation plays a crucial role in 3D scene understanding and is
extensively used in a wide range of vision tasks. Image-based methods struggle
in challenging scenarios, while event cameras offer high dynamic range and
temporal resolution but face difficulties with sparse data. Combining event and
image data provides significant advantages, yet effective integration remains
challenging. Existing CNN-based fusion methods struggle with occlusions and
depth disparities due to limited receptive fields, while Transformer-based
fusion methods often lack deep modality interaction. To address these issues,
we propose UniCT Depth, an event-image fusion method that unifies CNNs and
Transformers to model local and global features. We propose the
Convolution-compensated ViT Dual SA (CcViT-DA) Block, designed for the encoder,
which integrates Context Modeling Self-Attention (CMSA) to capture spatial
dependencies and Modal Fusion Self-Attention (MFSA) for effective cross-modal
fusion. Furthermore, we design the tailored Detail Compensation Convolution
(DCC) Block to improve texture details and enhances edge representations.
Experiments show that UniCT Depth outperforms existing image, event, and
fusion-based monocular depth estimation methods across key metrics.

Result: 在工业和医学数据集上展示了强大的零样本检测能力，并可扩展到少样本场景。

Conclusion: AF-CLIP在异常检测任务中表现出高效性和泛化能力，代码已开源。

Abstract: Visual anomaly detection has been widely used in industrial inspection and
medical diagnosis. Existing methods typically demand substantial training
samples, limiting their utility in zero-/few-shot scenarios. While recent
efforts have leveraged CLIP's zero-shot recognition capability for this task,
they often ignore optimizing visual features to focus on local anomalies,
reducing their efficacy. In this work, we propose AF-CLIP (Anomaly-Focused
CLIP) by dramatically enhancing its visual representations to focus on local
defects. Our approach introduces a lightweight adapter that emphasizes
anomaly-relevant patterns in visual features, simultaneously optimizing both
class-level features for image classification and patch-level features for
precise localization. To capture anomalies of different sizes and improve
detection accuracy, prior to the adapter, we develop a multi-scale spatial
aggregation mechanism to effectively consolidate neighborhood context.
Complementing these visual enhancements, we design learnable textual prompts
that generically characterize normal and abnormal states. After optimization on
auxiliary datasets using a composite objective function, AF-CLIP demonstrates
strong zero-shot detection capability. Our method is also extended to few-shot
scenarios by extra memory banks. Experimental results across diverse industrial
and medical datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our
proposed method. Code is available at https://github.com/Faustinaqq/AF-CLIP.

Abstract: Recent research leveraging large-scale pretrained diffusion models has
demonstrated the potential of using diffusion features to establish semantic
correspondences in images. Inspired by advancements in diffusion-based
techniques, we propose a novel zero-shot method for refining point cloud
registration algorithms. Our approach leverages correspondences derived from
depth images to enhance point feature representations, eliminating the need for
a dedicated training dataset. Specifically, we first project the point cloud
into depth maps from multiple perspectives and extract implicit knowledge from
a pretrained diffusion network as depth diffusion features. These features are
then integrated with geometric features obtained from existing methods to
establish more accurate correspondences between point clouds. By leveraging
these refined correspondences, our approach achieves significantly improved
registration accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not
only enhances the performance of existing point cloud registration techniques
but also exhibits robust generalization capabilities across diverse datasets.

projected to a latent space, temporally aligned to the fMRI time series, and
finally mapped to cortical parcels through a lightweight encoder comprising a
shared group head plus subject-specific residual heads. We trained hundreds of
model variants across hyperparameter settings, validated them on held-out
movies and assembled ensembles targeted to each parcel in each subject. Our
final submission achieved a mean Pearson's correlation of 0.2085 on the test
split of withheld out-of-distribution movies, placing our team in fourth place
for the competition. We further discuss a last-minute optimization that would
have raised us to second place. Our results highlight how combining features

Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a vital tool for diagnosing heart diseases.
However, many disease patterns are derived from outdated datasets and
traditional stepwise algorithms with limited accuracy. This study presents a
method for direct cardiovascular disease (CVD) diagnosis from ECG images,
eliminating the need for digitization. The proposed approach utilizes a
two-step curriculum learning framework, beginning with the pre-training of a

grayscale, inverted ECG images. Robustness is further enhanced through an
ensemble of three models with averaged outputs, achieving an AUC of 0.9534 and
an F1 score of 0.7801 on the BHF ECG Challenge dataset, outperforming
individual models. By effectively handling real-world artifacts and simplifying
the diagnostic process, this method offers a reliable solution for automated
CVD diagnosis, particularly in resource-limited settings where printed or
scanned ECG images are commonly used. Such an automated procedure enables rapid
and accurate diagnosis, which is critical for timely intervention in CVD cases

Abstract: The ability to abstract complex 3D environments into simplified and
structured representations is crucial across various domains. 3D semantic scene
graphs (SSGs) achieve this by representing objects as nodes and their
interrelationships as edges, facilitating high-level scene understanding.
Existing methods for 3D SSG generation, however, face significant challenges,
including high computational demands and non-incremental processing that hinder
their suitability for real-time open-world applications. To address this issue,
we propose FROSS (Faster-than-Real-Time Online 3D Semantic Scene Graph
Generation), an innovative approach for online and faster-than-real-time 3D SSG
generation that leverages the direct lifting of 2D scene graphs to 3D space and
represents objects as 3D Gaussian distributions. This framework eliminates the
dependency on precise and computationally-intensive point cloud processing.
Furthermore, we extend the Replica dataset with inter-object relationship
annotations, creating the ReplicaSSG dataset for comprehensive evaluation of
FROSS. The experimental results from evaluations on ReplicaSSG and 3DSSG
datasets show that FROSS can achieve superior performance while operating
significantly faster than prior 3D SSG generation methods. Our implementation

on small-sized medical datasets to identify the factors influencing their final
performance. We tested data with several common issues in medical domains, such
as data imbalance, data scarcity, and domain mismatch, through comparison
experiments to understand their impact on specific pre-trained models. Finally,
we provide recommendations to help users apply transfer learning and
self-supervised learning methods in medical areas, and build more convenient

Conclusion: OCTA-CVD数据集和VAMPIRE模型为CVD风险评估提供了更精确和实用的工具。

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death worldwide,
requiring urgent development of effective risk assessment methods for timely
intervention. While current research has introduced non-invasive and efficient
approaches to predict CVD risk from retinal imaging with deep learning models,
the commonly used fundus photographs and Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)
fail to capture detailed vascular features critical for CVD assessment compared
with OCT angiography (OCTA) images. Moreover, existing methods typically
classify CVD risk only as high or low, without providing a deeper analysis on
CVD-related blood factor conditions, thus limiting prediction accuracy and
clinical utility. As a result, we propose a novel multi-purpose paradigm of CVD
risk assessment that jointly performs CVD risk and CVD-related condition
prediction, aligning with clinical experiences. Based on this core idea, we
introduce OCTA-CVD, the first OCTA dataset for CVD risk assessment, and a
Vessel-Aware Mamba-based Prediction model with Informative Enhancement
(VAMPIRE) based on OCTA enface images. Our proposed model aims to extract
crucial vascular characteristics through two key components: (1) a Mamba-Based
Directional (MBD) Module that captures fine-grained vascular trajectory
features and (2) an Information-Enhanced Morphological (IEM) Module that
incorporates comprehensive vessel morphology knowledge. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method can surpass standard classification backbones,

TL;DR: RICE是一种新方法，通过区域级视觉和OCR能力增强视觉表示学习，适用于密集预测任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉-语言对比模型（如CLIP和SigLIP）依赖全局表示，限制了其在密集预测任务（如定位、OCR和分割）中的效果。

Method: 构建十亿级候选区域数据集，提出Region Transformer层提取区域语义，设计统一区域聚类判别损失，支持对象和OCR学习。

Result: RICE在分割、密集检测和MLLM视觉感知任务中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RICE通过区域级表示学习显著提升了密集预测任务的性能，模型已开源。

Abstract: Learning visual representations is foundational for a broad spectrum of
downstream tasks. Although recent vision-language contrastive models, such as
CLIP and SigLIP, have achieved impressive zero-shot performance via large-scale
vision-language alignment, their reliance on global representations constrains
their effectiveness for dense prediction tasks, such as grounding, OCR, and
segmentation. To address this gap, we introduce Region-Aware Cluster
Discrimination (RICE), a novel method that enhances region-level visual and OCR
capabilities. We first construct a billion-scale candidate region dataset and
propose a Region Transformer layer to extract rich regional semantics. We
further design a unified region cluster discrimination loss that jointly
supports object and OCR learning within a single classification framework,
enabling efficient and scalable distributed training on large-scale data.
Extensive experiments show that RICE consistently outperforms previous methods
on tasks, including segmentation, dense detection, and visual perception for
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). The pre-trained models have been
released at https://github.com/deepglint/MVT.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的测试时间主动学习（TTAL）框架，用于在实时数据流中动态更新提示并查询不确定样本，解决了单样本处理和延迟/内存限制的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何在连续数据流中有效利用预言机，仅处理单一样本并即时决策，同时满足延迟和内存限制。

Method: 引入动态调整的熵阈值进行主动查询，类平衡替换策略提高内存效率，以及类感知分布对齐技术增强适应性。

Result: 在10个跨数据集迁移基准和4个领域泛化数据集上表现优于现有方法，同时保持合理的延迟和内存开销。

Conclusion: TTAL框架为安全关键应用（如自动驾驶和医疗诊断）提供了实用且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Test-Time Optimization enables models to adapt to new data during inference
by updating parameters on-the-fly. Recent advances in Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) have explored learning prompts at test time to improve performance in
downstream tasks. In this work, we extend this idea by addressing a more
general and practical challenge: Can we effectively utilize an oracle in a
continuous data stream where only one sample is available at a time, requiring
an immediate query decision while respecting latency and memory constraints? To
tackle this, we propose a novel Test-Time Active Learning (TTAL) framework that
adaptively queries uncertain samples and updates prompts dynamically. Unlike
prior methods that assume batched data or multiple gradient updates, our
approach operates in a real-time streaming scenario with a single test sample
per step. We introduce a dynamically adjusted entropy threshold for active
querying, a class-balanced replacement strategy for memory efficiency, and a
class-aware distribution alignment technique to enhance adaptation. The design
choices are justified using careful theoretical analysis. Extensive experiments
across 10 cross-dataset transfer benchmarks and 4 domain generalization
datasets demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods
while maintaining reasonable latency and memory overhead. Our framework
provides a practical and effective solution for real-world deployment in
safety-critical applications such as autonomous systems and medical
diagnostics.

*Ze Rong,ZiYue Zhao,Zhaoxin Wang,Lei Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FaRMamba通过多尺度频率变换模块（MSFM）和自监督重建辅助编码器（SSRAE）解决了医疗图像分割中的高频信息丢失和空间结构退化问题，显著提升了分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗图像分割因模糊的病变边界（LBA）、高频细节丢失（LHD）和长距离解剖结构建模困难（DC-LRSS）而具有挑战性。

Method: 提出FaRMamba，包含MSFM模块（通过小波、余弦和傅里叶变换恢复高频信息）和SSRAE模块（通过像素级重建恢复2D空间相关性）。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优于现有方法，提升了边界精度、细节保留和全局一致性。

Conclusion: FaRMamba为医疗图像分割提供了一个灵活的频率感知框架，直接解决了核心挑战。

Abstract: Accurate medical image segmentation remains challenging due to blurred lesion
boundaries (LBA), loss of high-frequency details (LHD), and difficulty in
modeling long-range anatomical structures (DC-LRSS). Vision Mamba employs
one-dimensional causal state-space recurrence to efficiently model global
dependencies, thereby substantially mitigating DC-LRSS. However, its patch
tokenization and 1D serialization disrupt local pixel adjacency and impose a
low-pass filtering effect, resulting in Local High-frequency Information
Capture Deficiency (LHICD) and two-dimensional Spatial Structure Degradation
(2D-SSD), which in turn exacerbate LBA and LHD. In this work, we propose
FaRMamba, a novel extension that explicitly addresses LHICD and 2D-SSD through
two complementary modules. A Multi-Scale Frequency Transform Module (MSFM)
restores attenuated high-frequency cues by isolating and reconstructing
multi-band spectra via wavelet, cosine, and Fourier transforms. A
Self-Supervised Reconstruction Auxiliary Encoder (SSRAE) enforces pixel-level
reconstruction on the shared Mamba encoder to recover full 2D spatial
correlations, enhancing both fine textures and global context. Extensive
evaluations on CAMUS echocardiography, MRI-based Mouse-cochlea, and Kvasir-Seg
endoscopy demonstrate that FaRMamba consistently outperforms competitive
CNN-Transformer hybrids and existing Mamba variants, delivering superior
boundary accuracy, detail preservation, and global coherence without
prohibitive computational overhead. This work provides a flexible
frequency-aware framework for future segmentation models that directly
mitigates core challenges in medical imaging.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无监督方法，通过减少模型对EOS标记的偏见，生成长度更长、细节更丰富的图像描述，无需复杂奖励函数或监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉语言模型（VLMs）在图像描述生成方面取得了进展，但生成的描述往往简短且缺乏细节。研究发现，这是由于交叉熵训练中引入的对EOS标记的偏见。

Method: 提出了一种无监督方法，通过减少模型对EOS标记的偏见，鼓励生成更长的描述。该方法简单且适用于任何预训练模型。

Result: 在三个VLMs和三个详细描述基准上的实验表明，该方法显著增加了描述长度和相关细节，但幻觉率也有所增加。

Conclusion: 该方法简单有效，无需额外监督即可提升图像描述的细节丰富度。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in vision-language models (VLMs), image
captioning often suffers from a lack of detail, with base models producing
short, generic captions. This limitation persists even though VLMs are equipped
with strong vision and language backbones. While supervised data and complex
reward functions have been proposed to improve detailed image captioning, we
identify a simpler underlying issue: a bias towards the end-of-sequence (EOS)
token, which is introduced during cross-entropy training. We propose an
unsupervised method to debias the model's tendency to predict the EOS token
prematurely. By reducing this bias, we encourage the generation of longer, more
detailed captions without the need for intricate reward functions or
supervision. Our approach is straightforward, effective, and easily applicable
to any pretrained model. We demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments
with three VLMs and on three detailed captioning benchmarks. Our results show a
substantial increase in caption length and relevant details, albeit with an
expected increase in the rate of hallucinations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在生成人像时过于关注姿态精度，而忽略了整体图像质量，因此需要一种兼顾两者的解决方案。

Method: 采用知识库（KB）增强姿态精度并利用图像特征保持全局质量，动态掩码（DM）调整姿态相关区域的重要性。

Result: 在HumanArt数据集上，模型在AP和CAP指标上达到新的最优性能。

Conclusion: KB-DMGen有效平衡了姿态精度和全局图像质量，为生成高质量人像提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent methods using diffusion models have made significant progress in human
image generation with various control signals such as pose priors. In portrait
generation, both the accuracy of human pose and the overall visual quality are
crucial for realistic synthesis. Most existing methods focus on controlling the
accuracy of generated poses, but ignore the quality assurance of the entire
image. In order to ensure the global image quality and pose accuracy, we
propose Knowledge-Based Global Guidance and Dynamic pose Masking for human
image Generation (KB-DMGen). The Knowledge Base (KB) is designed not only to
enhance pose accuracy but also to leverage image feature information to
maintain overall image quality. Dynamic Masking (DM) dynamically adjusts the
importance of pose-related regions. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our model, achieving new state-of-the-art results in terms of AP and CAP on
the HumanArt dataset. The code will be made publicly available.

Result: 在真实和合成数据集上的实验表明，HDST显著提高了去噪性能，同时保持了计算效率。

Conclusion: 该研究为HSI和其他高维视觉数据中的复杂噪声耦合问题提供了新的见解和通用框架。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image denoising faces the challenge of multi-dimensional
coupling of spatially non-uniform noise and spectral correlation interference.
Existing deep learning methods mostly focus on RGB images and struggle to
effectively handle the unique spatial-spectral characteristics and complex
noise distributions of hyperspectral images (HSI). This paper proposes an HSI
denoising framework, Hybrid-Domain Synergistic Transformer Network (HDST),
based on frequency domain enhancement and multiscale modeling, achieving
three-dimensional collaborative processing of spatial, frequency and channel
domains. The method innovatively integrates three key mechanisms: (1)
introducing an FFT preprocessing module with multi-band convolution to extract
cross-band correlations and decouple spectral noise components; (2) designing a
dynamic cross-domain attention module that adaptively fuses spatial domain
texture features and frequency domain noise priors through a learnable gating
mechanism; (3) building a hierarchical architecture where shallow layers
capture global noise statistics using multiscale atrous convolution, and deep
layers achieve detail recovery through frequency domain postprocessing.
Experiments on both real and synthetic datasets demonstrate that HDST
significantly improves denoising performance while maintaining computational
efficiency, validating the effectiveness of the proposed method. This research
provides new insights and a universal framework for addressing complex noise
coupling issues in HSI and other high-dimensional visual data. The code is

Motivation: 内侧上髁撕脱常见于棒球运动员，表现为骨骼轮廓的不连续性。学习正常骨骼的结构和连续性对于检测此类异常至关重要。

Method: 提出了一种基于掩码自编码器的结构感知重建框架，学习正常骨骼结构的连续性。模型在撕脱部位尝试重建正常结构，导致较大的重建误差。

Result: 在包含16名棒球运动员的正常和撕脱超声图像的数据集上，方法表现优于现有方法，像素级AUC为0.965，图像级AUC为0.967。

Conclusion: 该方法通过学习正常骨骼结构，有效检测内侧上髁撕脱，数据集已公开。

Abstract: This study proposes a reconstruction-based framework for detecting medial
epicondyle avulsion in elbow ultrasound images, trained exclusively on normal
cases. Medial epicondyle avulsion, commonly observed in baseball players,
involves bone detachment and deformity, often appearing as discontinuities in
bone contour. Therefore, learning the structure and continuity of normal bone
is essential for detecting such abnormalities. To achieve this, we propose a
masked autoencoder-based, structure-aware reconstruction framework that learns
the continuity of normal bone structures. Even in the presence of avulsion, the
model attempts to reconstruct the normal structure, resulting in large
reconstruction errors at the avulsion site. For evaluation, we constructed a
novel dataset comprising normal and avulsion ultrasound images from 16 baseball
players, with pixel-level annotations under orthopedic supervision. Our method
outperformed existing approaches, achieving a pixel-wise AUC of 0.965 and an
image-wise AUC of 0.967. The dataset is publicly available at:

Method: 提出动态分辨率多尺度体素化（DR-MSV）和轻量级元嵌入机制（TAP-LME），结合NeRF技术。

Result: DR-MSV显著提高了点云特征提取的效率和精度，TAP-LME在捕捉细粒度语义上优于传统方法。

Conclusion: NeuroVoxel-LM为3D场景感知提供了一种高效且精确的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in Visual Language Models (VLMs) and Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced 3D scene perception towards
language-driven cognition. However, existing 3D language models struggle with
sparse, large-scale point clouds due to slow feature extraction and limited
representation accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose NeuroVoxel-LM,
a novel framework that integrates Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) with dynamic
resolution voxelization and lightweight meta-embedding. Specifically, we
introduce a Dynamic Resolution Multiscale Voxelization (DR-MSV) technique that
adaptively adjusts voxel granularity based on geometric and structural
complexity, reducing computational cost while preserving reconstruction
fidelity. In addition, we propose the Token-level Adaptive Pooling for
Lightweight Meta-Embedding (TAP-LME) mechanism, which enhances semantic
representation through attention-based weighting and residual fusion.
Experimental results demonstrate that DR-MSV significantly improves point cloud
feature extraction efficiency and accuracy, while TAP-LME outperforms
conventional max-pooling in capturing fine-grained semantics from NeRF weights.

Abstract: Crowd evacuation simulation is critical for enhancing public safety, and
demanded for realistic virtual environments. Current mainstream evacuation
models overlook the complex human behaviors that occur during evacuation, such
as pedestrian collisions, interpersonal interactions, and variations in
behavior influenced by terrain types or individual body shapes. This results in
the failure to accurately simulate the escape of people in the real world. In
this paper, aligned with the sensory-decision-motor (SDM) flow of the human
brain, we propose a real-time 3D crowd evacuation simulation framework that
integrates a 3D-adaptive SFM (Social Force Model) Decision Mechanism and a
Personalized Gait Control Motor. This framework allows multiple agents to move
in parallel and is suitable for various scenarios, with dynamic crowd
awareness. Additionally, we introduce Part-level Force Visualization to assist
in evacuation analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework
supports dynamic trajectory planning and personalized behavior for each agent
throughout the evacuation process, and is compatible with uneven terrain.
Visually, our method generates evacuation results that are more realistic and
plausible, providing enhanced insights for crowd simulation. The code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在线视频分割中时序一致性的挑战，如噪声积累、遮挡和场景转换。

Method: 提出Local2Global框架，结合DETR的查询传播，引入局部和全局查询，并通过L2G-aligner实现对齐。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，如Youtube-VIS-19/-21和OVIS，AP分别为54.3、49.4和37.0。

Conclusion: Local2Global框架简单高效，无需复杂启发式或内存机制，显著提升在线视频分割性能。

Abstract: Online video segmentation methods excel at handling long sequences and
capturing gradual changes, making them ideal for real-world applications.
However, achieving temporally consistent predictions remains a challenge,
especially with gradual accumulation of noise or drift in on-line propagation,
abrupt occlusions and scene transitions. This paper introduces Local2Global, an
online framework, for video instance segmentation, exhibiting state-of-the-art
performance with simple baseline and training purely in online fashion.
Leveraging the DETR-based query propagation framework, we introduce two novel
sets of queries:(1) local queries that capture initial object-specific spatial
features from each frame and (2) global queries containing past spatio-temporal
representations. We propose the L2G-aligner, a novel lightweight transformer
decoder, to facilitate an early alignment between local and global queries.
This alignment allows our model to effectively utilize current frame
information while maintaining temporal consistency, producing a smooth
transition between frames. Furthermore, L2G-aligner is integrated within the
segmentation model, without relying on additional complex heuristics, or memory
mechanisms. Extensive experiments across various challenging VIS and VPS
datasets showcase the superiority of our method with simple online training,
surpassing current benchmarks without bells and rings. For instance, we achieve
54.3 and 49.4 AP on Youtube-VIS-19/-21 datasets and 37.0 AP on OVIS dataset
respectively withthe ResNet-50 backbone.

Result: 在Plant Village和PlantDoc数据集上，Mo-DsCC在准确率和F1分数上优于其他方法。

Conclusion: Mo-DsCC为智能农业提供了有效的解决方案，并为学术界和工业界带来新思路。

Abstract: Plant leaf disease classification is an important task in smart agriculture
which plays a critical role in sustainable production. Modern machine learning
approaches have shown unprecedented potential in this classification task which
offers an array of benefits including time saving and cost reduction. However,
most recent approaches directly employ convolutional neural networks where the
effect of the relationship between plant species and disease types on
prediction performance is not properly studied. In this study, we proposed a
new model named Multi-output Deep Supervised Classifier Chains (Mo-DsCC) which
weaves the prediction of plant species and disease by chaining the output
layers for the two labels. Mo-DsCC consists of three components: A modified
VGG-16 network as the backbone, deep supervision training, and a stack of
classification chains. To evaluate the advantages of our model, we perform
intensive experiments on two benchmark datasets Plant Village and PlantDoc.
Comparison to recent approaches, including multi-model, multi-label
(Power-set), multi-output and multi-task, demonstrates that Mo-DsCC achieves
better accuracy and F1-score. The empirical study in this paper shows that the
application of Mo-DsCC could be a useful puzzle for smart agriculture to
benefit farms and bring new ideas to industry and academia.

which we extract multi-metric spatial descriptors: principal component
directions, kernel density hotspots, size-depth regression, and Delaunay edge

Result: 在DVTOD、DroneVehicle和M3FD数据集上，WMNet实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: WMNet有效解决了跨模态不对齐问题，提升了目标检测的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Visible-infrared object detection aims to enhance the detection robustness by
exploiting the complementary information of visible and infrared image pairs.
However, its performance is often limited by frequent misalignments caused by
resolution disparities, spatial displacements, and modality inconsistencies. To
address this issue, we propose the Wavelet-guided Misalignment-aware Network
(WMNet), a unified framework designed to adaptively address different
cross-modal misalignment patterns. WMNet incorporates wavelet-based
multi-frequency analysis and modality-aware fusion mechanisms to improve the
alignment and integration of cross-modal features. By jointly exploiting low
and high-frequency information and introducing adaptive guidance across
modalities, WMNet alleviates the adverse effects of noise, illumination
variation, and spatial misalignment. Furthermore, it enhances the
representation of salient target features while suppressing spurious or
misleading information, thereby promoting more accurate and robust detection.
Extensive evaluations on the DVTOD, DroneVehicle, and M3FD datasets demonstrate
that WMNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on misaligned cross-modal
object detection tasks, confirming its effectiveness and practical
applicability.

Result: 实验表明，GT-mean loss能显著提升多种方法和数据集上的性能。

Conclusion: GT-mean loss是一种简单有效的解决方案，解决了亮度不匹配问题，推动了LLIE研究的发展。

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) aims to improve the visual quality of
images captured under poor lighting conditions. In supervised LLIE research,
there exists a significant yet often overlooked inconsistency between the
overall brightness of an enhanced image and its ground truth counterpart,
referred to as brightness mismatch in this study. Brightness mismatch
negatively impact supervised LLIE models by misleading model training. However,
this issue is largely neglected in current research. In this context, we
propose the GT-mean loss, a simple yet effective loss function directly
modeling the mean values of images from a probabilistic perspective. The
GT-mean loss is flexible, as it extends existing supervised LLIE loss functions
into the GT-mean form with minimal additional computational costs. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the incorporation of the GT-mean loss results in
consistent performance improvements across various methods and datasets.

Result: 实验表明，经过过滤的数据集性能优于或等同于大规模爬取的噪声数据。

Conclusion: 该方法为构建高质量视觉语言训练数据提供了轻量且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) extend the conventional large language models
by integrating visual data, enabling richer multimodal reasoning and
significantly broadens the practical applications of AI. However, including
visual inputs also brings new challenges in maintaining data quality. Empirical
evidence consistently shows that carefully curated and representative training
examples often yield superior results compared to simply increasing the
quantity of data. Inspired by this observation, we introduce a streamlined data
filtration framework that employs a compact VLM, fine-tuned on a high-quality
image-caption annotated dataset. This model effectively evaluates and filters
potential training samples based on caption and image quality and alignment.
Unlike previous approaches, which typically add auxiliary filtration modules on
top of existing full-scale VLMs, our method exclusively utilizes the inherent
evaluative capability of a purpose-built small VLM. This strategy eliminates
the need for extra modules and reduces training overhead. Our lightweight model
efficiently filters out inaccurate, noisy web data, improving image-text
alignment and caption linguistic fluency. Experimental results show that
datasets underwent high-precision filtration using our compact VLM perform on
par with, or even surpass, larger and noisier datasets gathered through
high-volume web crawling. Thus, our method provides a lightweight yet robust
solution for building high-quality vision-language training corpora. \\

*Yuhong Zhang,Liyao Wang,Han Wang,Danni Wu,Zuzeng Lin,Feng Wang,Li Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AnimeColor是一种基于参考的动画着色框架，利用扩散变换器（DiT）实现高精度和时间一致性的动画着色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在动画着色中难以实现颜色准确性和时间一致性，AnimeColor旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 结合草图序列和DiT视频扩散模型，引入高级颜色提取器（HCE）和低级颜色引导器（LCG），采用多阶段训练策略。

Result: AnimeColor在颜色准确性、草图对齐、时间一致性和视觉质量上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AnimeColor不仅推动了动画着色技术的发展，还为工业应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Animation colorization plays a vital role in animation production, yet
existing methods struggle to achieve color accuracy and temporal consistency.
To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{AnimeColor}, a novel
reference-based animation colorization framework leveraging Diffusion
Transformers (DiT). Our approach integrates sketch sequences into a DiT-based
video diffusion model, enabling sketch-controlled animation generation. We
introduce two key components: a High-level Color Extractor (HCE) to capture
semantic color information and a Low-level Color Guider (LCG) to extract
fine-grained color details from reference images. These components work
synergistically to guide the video diffusion process. Additionally, we employ a
multi-stage training strategy to maximize the utilization of reference image
color information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AnimeColor
outperforms existing methods in color accuracy, sketch alignment, temporal
consistency, and visual quality. Our framework not only advances the state of
the art in animation colorization but also provides a practical solution for
industrial applications. The code will be made publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于多模态提示的身份感知体育视频字幕生成方法（LLM-IAVC），通过提取玩家身份信息和视频内容，生成包含玩家身份的描述。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有体育视频字幕方法常忽略玩家身份，或依赖与视频内容无关的额外信息导致错误。

Method: 设计了身份相关信息提取模块（IRIEM）和视觉上下文学习模块（VCLM），结合多模态提示生成身份感知描述。

Result: 在NBA-Identity和VC-NBA-2022数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: LLM-IAVC通过视觉和多模态信息结合，有效提升了身份感知字幕生成的准确性。

Abstract: Existing sports video captioning methods often focus on the action yet
overlook player identities, limiting their applicability. Although some methods
integrate extra information to generate identity-aware descriptions, the player
identities are sometimes incorrect because the extra information is independent
of the video content. This paper proposes a player-centric multimodal prompt
generation network for identity-aware sports video captioning (LLM-IAVC), which
focuses on recognizing player identities from a visual perspective.
Specifically, an identity-related information extraction module (IRIEM) is
designed to extract player-related multimodal embeddings. IRIEM includes a
player identification network (PIN) for extracting visual features and player
names, and a bidirectional semantic interaction module (BSIM) to link player
features with video content for mutual enhancement. Additionally, a visual
context learning module (VCLM) is designed to capture the key video context
information. Finally, by integrating the outputs of the above modules as the
multimodal prompt for the large language model (LLM), it facilitates the
generation of descriptions with player identities. To support this work, we
construct a new benchmark called NBA-Identity, a large identity-aware
basketball video captioning dataset with 9,726 videos covering 9 major event
types. The experimental results on NBA-Identity and VC-NBA-2022 demonstrate
that our proposed model achieves advanced performance. Code and dataset are

### [208] [PUMPS: Skeleton-Agnostic Point-based Universal Motion Pre-Training for Synthesis in Human Motion Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20170)
*Clinton Ansun Mo,Kun Hu,Chengjiang Long,Dong Yuan,Wan-Chi Siu,Zhiyong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出PUMPS，一种用于Temporal Point Clouds（TPC）数据的自编码器架构，解决了TPC格式在运动任务学习中的挑战，并在多项任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于骨骼结构的差异，运动数据难以跨骨架传输，TPC作为一种非结构化表示虽兼容性强，但缺乏直接用于运动任务学习的能力。

Method: 提出PUMPS架构，通过帧级点云特征向量和潜在高斯噪声向量实现TPC重建，并引入线性分配优化配对，避免昂贵的注意力机制。

Result: PUMPS在运动预测、过渡生成和关键帧插值等任务中表现优异，无需监督即可达到先进水平；在微调任务中优于其他方法。

Conclusion: PUMPS为TPC数据提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案，展示了其在运动合成任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Motion skeletons drive 3D character animation by transforming bone
hierarchies, but differences in proportions or structure make motion data hard
to transfer across skeletons, posing challenges for data-driven motion
synthesis. Temporal Point Clouds (TPCs) offer an unstructured, cross-compatible
motion representation. Though reversible with skeletons, TPCs mainly serve for
compatibility, not for direct motion task learning. Doing so would require data
synthesis capabilities for the TPC format, which presents unexplored challenges
regarding its unique temporal consistency and point identifiability. Therefore,
we propose PUMPS, the primordial autoencoder architecture for TPC data. PUMPS
independently reduces frame-wise point clouds into sampleable feature vectors,
from which a decoder extracts distinct temporal points using latent Gaussian
noise vectors as sampling identifiers. We introduce linear assignment-based
point pairing to optimise the TPC reconstruction process, and negate the use of
expensive point-wise attention mechanisms in the architecture. Using these
latent features, we pre-train a motion synthesis model capable of performing
motion prediction, transition generation, and keyframe interpolation. For these
pre-training tasks, PUMPS performs remarkably well even without native dataset
supervision, matching state-of-the-art performance. When fine-tuned for motion
denoising or estimation, PUMPS outperforms many respective methods without
deviating from its generalist architecture.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种空间评估流程和基准测试，用于评估视觉语言模型（VLMs）的空间理解能力，发现其表现远低于人类水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用（如自动驾驶和人形机器人操作）需要精确的空间感知，但VLMs的空间关系识别能力尚未充分探索。

Method: 构建合成数据集，将空间理解分为绝对空间理解和3D空间理解，并测试多个先进VLMs。

Result: 人类在所有任务中表现近乎完美，而VLMs仅在两个最简单任务中达到人类水平，其余任务表现显著较低，部分任务得分接近零。

Conclusion: VLMs的空间理解能力仍有显著提升空间，合成数据集为低成本测试提供了可能。

Abstract: Real-world applications, such as autonomous driving and humanoid robot
manipulation, require precise spatial perception. However, it remains
underexplored how Vision-Language Models (VLMs) recognize spatial relationships
and perceive spatial movement. In this work, we introduce a spatial evaluation
pipeline and construct a corresponding benchmark. Specifically, we categorize
spatial understanding into two main types: absolute spatial understanding,
which involves querying the absolute spatial position (e.g., left, right) of an
object within an image, and 3D spatial understanding, which includes movement
and rotation. Notably, our dataset is entirely synthetic, enabling the
generation of test samples at a low cost while also preventing dataset
contamination. We conduct experiments on multiple state-of-the-art VLMs and
observe that there is significant room for improvement in their spatial
understanding abilities. Explicitly, in our experiments, humans achieve
near-perfect performance on all tasks, whereas current VLMs attain human-level
performance only on the two simplest tasks. For the remaining tasks, the
performance of VLMs is distinctly lower than that of humans. In fact, the
best-performing Vision-Language Models even achieve near-zero scores on
multiple tasks. The dataset and code are available on

Conclusion: Modaltracker通过统一架构和参数共享，显著提升了多模态跟踪任务的性能和效率。

Abstract: We propose a universal video-level modality-awareness tracking model with
online dense temporal token learning (called {\modaltracker}). It is designed
to support various tracking tasks, including RGB, RGB+Thermal, RGB+Depth, and
RGB+Event, utilizing the same model architecture and parameters. Specifically,
our model is designed with three core goals: \textbf{Video-level Sampling}. We
expand the model's inputs to a video sequence level, aiming to see a richer
video context from an near-global perspective. \textbf{Video-level
Association}. Furthermore, we introduce two simple yet effective online dense
temporal token association mechanisms to propagate the appearance and motion
trajectory information of target via a video stream manner. \textbf{Modality
Scalable}. We propose two novel gated perceivers that adaptively learn
cross-modal representations via a gated attention mechanism, and subsequently
compress them into the same set of model parameters via a one-shot training
manner for multi-task inference. This new solution brings the following
benefits: (i) The purified token sequences can serve as temporal prompts for
the inference in the next video frames, whereby previous information is
leveraged to guide future inference. (ii) Unlike multi-modal trackers that
require independent training, our one-shot training scheme not only alleviates
the training burden, but also improves model representation. Extensive
experiments on visible and multi-modal benchmarks show that our {\modaltracker}
achieves a new \textit{SOTA} performance. The code will be available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 光照变化影响红外与可见光图像融合质量，现有方法常忽略此因素导致模态偏差。

Method: 提出MoCTEFuse网络，利用光照门控的MoCTE（含高/低光照专家子网络）和CTFB块动态切换模态并分配权重，结合多阶段堆叠和竞争性损失函数。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，检测mAP达70.93%（MFNet）和45.14%（DroneVehicle）。

Conclusion: MoCTEFuse通过动态光照适应和多级融合，显著提升图像融合性能。

Abstract: While illumination changes inevitably affect the quality of infrared and
visible image fusion, many outstanding methods still ignore this factor and
directly merge the information from source images, leading to modality bias in
the fused results. To this end, we propose a dynamic multi-level image fusion
network called MoCTEFuse, which applies an illumination-gated Mixture of Chiral
Transformer Experts (MoCTE) to adaptively preserve texture details and object
contrasts in balance. MoCTE consists of high- and low-illumination expert
subnetworks, each built upon the Chiral Transformer Fusion Block (CTFB). Guided
by the illumination gating signals, CTFB dynamically switches between the
primary and auxiliary modalities as well as assigning them corresponding
weights with its asymmetric cross-attention mechanism. Meanwhile, it is stacked
at multiple stages to progressively aggregate and refine modality-specific and
cross-modality information. To facilitate robust training, we propose a
competitive loss function that integrates illumination distributions with three
levels of sub-loss terms. Extensive experiments conducted on the DroneVehicle,
MSRS, TNO and RoadScene datasets show MoCTEFuse's superior fusion performance.
Finally, it achieves the best detection mean Average Precision (mAP) of 70.93%
on the MFNet dataset and 45.14% on the DroneVehicle dataset. The code and model
are released at https://github.com/Bitlijinfu/MoCTEFuse.

TL;DR: SAMwave是一种基于小波变换的新方法，用于改进SAM模型在复杂任务中的性能，显著优于现有适配方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型基础模型（如SAM）在复杂任务中性能下降，现有适配方法效果有限。

Method: 提出SAMwave，利用小波变换提取多尺度高频特征，并引入复数适配器捕获复数空间频率信息。

Result: 在四个低层视觉任务中，SAMwave显著优于现有方法，适用于SAM和SAM2模型。

Conclusion: SAMwave高效、灵活且可解释，为改进基础模型适应复杂任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: The emergence of large foundation models has propelled significant advances
in various domains. The Segment Anything Model (SAM), a leading model for image
segmentation, exemplifies these advances, outperforming traditional methods.
However, such foundation models often suffer from performance degradation when
applied to complex tasks for which they are not trained. Existing methods
typically employ adapter-based fine-tuning strategies to adapt SAM for tasks
and leverage high-frequency features extracted from the Fourier domain.
However, Our analysis reveals that these approaches offer limited benefits due
to constraints in their feature extraction techniques. To overcome this, we
propose \textbf{\textit{SAMwave}}, a novel and interpretable approach that
utilizes the wavelet transform to extract richer, multi-scale high-frequency
features from input data. Extending this, we introduce complex-valued adapters
capable of capturing complex-valued spatial-frequency information via complex
wavelet transforms. By adaptively integrating these wavelet coefficients,
SAMwave enables SAM's encoder to capture information more relevant for dense
prediction. Empirical evaluations on four challenging low-level vision tasks
demonstrate that SAMwave significantly outperforms existing adaptation methods.
This superior performance is consistent across both the SAM and SAM2 backbones
and holds for both real and complex-valued adapter variants, highlighting the
efficiency, flexibility, and interpretability of our proposed method for
adapting segment anything models.

Abstract: Detecting text in natural scenes remains challenging, particularly for
diverse scripts and arbitrarily shaped instances where visual cues alone are
often insufficient. Existing methods do not fully leverage semantic context.
This paper introduces SAViL-Det, a novel semantic-aware vision-language model
that enhances multi-script text detection by effectively integrating textual
prompts with visual features. SAViL-Det utilizes a pre-trained CLIP model
combined with an Asymptotic Feature Pyramid Network (AFPN) for multi-scale

information from text prompts to visual features via cross-modal attention.
Furthermore, a text-to-pixel contrastive learning mechanism explicitly aligns
textual and corresponding visual pixel features. Extensive experiments on
challenging benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach,
achieving state-of-the-art performance with F-scores of 84.8% on the benchmark
multi-lingual MLT-2019 dataset and 90.2% on the curved-text CTW1500 dataset.

Abstract: The goal of this investigation is to quantify to what extent computer vision

We extend our experiments by recognizing expressions using only the upper or
lower part of the face, which is needed to further investigate the difference
in emotion manifestation between hearing and deaf subjects. To take into
account the peculiar color profile of a dataset, our method introduces a color
normalization stage based on histogram equalization and fine-tuning. The
results show the ability to correctly recognize facial expressions with 83.8%
mean sensitivity and very little variance (.042) among classes. Like for
humans, recognition of expressions from the lower half of the face (79.6%) is
higher than that from the upper half (77.9%). Noticeably, the classification
accuracy from the upper half of the face is higher than human level.

Conclusion: 令牌压缩是多模态长上下文处理的关键方向，本文为研究者提供了系统参考和未来启发。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made remarkable strides,
largely driven by their ability to process increasingly long and complex
contexts, such as high-resolution images, extended video sequences, and lengthy
audio input. While this ability significantly enhances MLLM capabilities, it
introduces substantial computational challenges, primarily due to the quadratic
complexity of self-attention mechanisms with numerous input tokens. To mitigate
these bottlenecks, token compression has emerged as an auspicious and critical
approach, efficiently reducing the number of tokens during both training and
inference. In this paper, we present the first systematic survey and synthesis
of the burgeoning field of multimodal long context token compression.
Recognizing that effective compression strategies are deeply tied to the unique
characteristics and redundancies of each modality, we categorize existing
approaches by their primary data focus, enabling researchers to quickly access
and learn methods tailored to their specific area of interest: (1)
image-centric compression, which addresses spatial redundancy in visual data;
(2) video-centric compression, which tackles spatio-temporal redundancy in
dynamic sequences; and (3) audio-centric compression, which handles temporal
and spectral redundancy in acoustic signals. Beyond this modality-driven
categorization, we further dissect methods based on their underlying
mechanisms, including transformation-based, similarity-based, attention-based,
and query-based approaches. By providing a comprehensive and structured
overview, this survey aims to consolidate current progress, identify key
challenges, and inspire future research directions in this rapidly evolving
domain. We also maintain a public repository to continuously track and update
the latest advances in this promising area.

Conclusion: 该模型通过全局与局部特征融合，有效提升了矿区场景分类的准确性。

Abstract: Scene classification of mining areas provides accurate foundational data for
geological environment monitoring and resource development planning. This study
fuses multi-source data to construct a multi-modal mine land cover scene
classification dataset. A significant challenge in mining area classification
lies in the complex spatial layout and multi-scale characteristics. By
extracting global and local features, it becomes possible to comprehensively
reflect the spatial distribution, thereby enabling a more accurate capture of
the holistic characteristics of mining scenes. We propose a dual-branch fusion
model utilizing collaborative representation to decompose global features into
a set of key semantic vectors. This model comprises three key components:(1)
Multi-scale Global Transformer Branch: It leverages adjacent large-scale
features to generate global channel attention features for small-scale
features, effectively capturing the multi-scale feature relationships. (2)
Local Enhancement Collaborative Representation Branch: It refines the attention
weights by leveraging local features and reconstructed key semantic sets,
ensuring that the local context and detailed characteristics of the mining area
are effectively integrated. This enhances the model's sensitivity to
fine-grained spatial variations. (3) Dual-Branch Deep Feature Fusion Module: It
fuses the complementary features of the two branches to incorporate more scene
information. This fusion strengthens the model's ability to distinguish and
classify complex mining landscapes. Finally, this study employs multi-loss
computation to ensure a balanced integration of the modules. The overall
accuracy of this model is 83.63%, which outperforms other comparative models.
Additionally, it achieves the best performance across all other evaluation
metrics.

Conclusion: MECo框架提供了细粒度控制，支持多种输入模态，并开源了代码和模型。

Abstract: The automatic generation of controllable co-speech gestures has recently
gained growing attention. While existing systems typically achieve gesture
control through predefined categorical labels or implicit pseudo-labels derived
from motion examples, these approaches often compromise the rich details
present in the original motion examples. We present MECo, a framework for
motion-example-controlled co-speech gesture generation by leveraging large
language models (LLMs). Our method capitalizes on LLMs' comprehension
capabilities through fine-tuning to simultaneously interpret speech audio and
motion examples, enabling the synthesis of gestures that preserve
example-specific characteristics while maintaining speech congruence. Departing
from conventional pseudo-labeling paradigms, we position motion examples as
explicit query contexts within the prompt structure to guide gesture
generation. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance
across three metrics: Fr\'echet Gesture Distance (FGD), motion diversity, and
example-gesture similarity. Furthermore, our framework enables granular control
of individual body parts and accommodates diverse input modalities including
motion clips, static poses, human video sequences, and textual descriptions.

Conclusion: MambaMap通过高效融合时域特征，显著提升了高精地图构建的性能和效率。

Abstract: High-definition (HD) maps are essential for autonomous driving, as they
provide precise road information for downstream tasks. Recent advances
highlight the potential of temporal modeling in addressing challenges like
occlusions and extended perception range. However, existing methods either fail
to fully exploit temporal information or incur substantial computational
overhead in handling extended sequences. To tackle these challenges, we propose
MambaMap, a novel framework that efficiently fuses long-range temporal features
in the state space to construct online vectorized HD maps. Specifically,
MambaMap incorporates a memory bank to store and utilize information from
historical frames, dynamically updating BEV features and instance queries to
improve robustness against noise and occlusions. Moreover, we introduce a
gating mechanism in the state space, selectively integrating dependencies of
map elements in high computational efficiency. In addition, we design
innovative multi-directional and spatial-temporal scanning strategies to
enhance feature extraction at both BEV and instance levels. These strategies
significantly boost the prediction accuracy of our approach while ensuring
robust temporal consistency. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and
Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate that our proposed MambaMap approach outperforms
state-of-the-art methods across various splits and perception ranges. Source

Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅（GS）在高质量场景重建中表现优异，但训练过程收敛慢，原因是高斯基元的密度化和空间分布效率低。

Method: 提出了全局到局部的高斯密度化策略，结合能量引导的多分辨率训练框架，动态剪枝不必要的基元。

Result: 在多个数据集上实验表明，训练速度提升2倍以上，基元数量减少且重建性能更优。

Conclusion: 该方法通过优化密度化和训练策略，显著提升了GS的训练效率和重建质量。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) has emerged as a powerful representation for
high-quality scene reconstruction, offering compelling rendering quality.
However, the training process of GS often suffers from slow convergence due to
inefficient densification and suboptimal spatial distribution of Gaussian
primitives. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of the split and
clone operations during the densification phase, revealing their distinct roles
in balancing detail preservation and computational efficiency. Building upon
this analysis, we propose a global-to-local densification strategy, which
facilitates more efficient growth of Gaussians across the scene space,
promoting both global coverage and local refinement. To cooperate with the
proposed densification strategy and promote sufficient diffusion of Gaussian
primitives in space, we introduce an energy-guided coarse-to-fine
multi-resolution training framework, which gradually increases resolution based
on energy density in 2D images. Additionally, we dynamically prune unnecessary
Gaussian primitives to speed up the training. Extensive experiments on
MipNeRF-360, Deep Blending, and Tanks & Temples datasets demonstrate that our
approach significantly accelerates training,achieving over 2x speedup with
fewer Gaussian primitives and superior reconstruction performance.

Abstract: Wildlife observation plays an important role in biodiversity conservation,
necessitating robust methodologies for monitoring wildlife populations and
interspecies interactions. Recent advances in computer vision have
significantly contributed to automating fundamental wildlife observation tasks,
such as animal detection and species identification. However, accurately
identifying species from indirect evidence like footprints and feces remains
relatively underexplored, despite its importance in contributing to wildlife
monitoring. To bridge this gap, we introduce AnimalClue, the first large-scale
dataset for species identification from images of indirect evidence. Our
dataset consists of 159,605 bounding boxes encompassing five categories of
indirect clues: footprints, feces, eggs, bones, and feathers. It covers 968
species, 200 families, and 65 orders. Each image is annotated with
species-level labels, bounding boxes or segmentation masks, and fine-grained
trait information, including activity patterns and habitat preferences. Unlike
existing datasets primarily focused on direct visual features (e.g., animal
appearances), AnimalClue presents unique challenges for classification,
detection, and instance segmentation tasks due to the need for recognizing more
detailed and subtle visual features. In our experiments, we extensively
evaluate representative vision models and identify key challenges in animal
identification from their traces. Our dataset and code are available at

TL;DR: MIRepNet是一种专为运动想象（MI）范式设计的EEG基础模型，通过结合自监督和监督预训练策略，显著提升了在少量数据下的解码性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有EEG基础模型忽视了范式特定的神经生理学差异，限制了其泛化能力。MIRepNet旨在解决这一问题，专注于MI范式。

Method: MIRepNet结合了高质量的EEG预处理流程和混合预训练策略（自监督掩码标记重建和监督MI分类）。

Result: 在五个公开MI数据集上，MIRepNet表现优于其他专用和通用EEG模型。

Conclusion: MIRepNet为MI范式提供了高效的基础模型，适用于少量数据的快速适应和准确解码。

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) enable direct communication between the
brain and external devices. Recent EEG foundation models aim to learn
generalized representations across diverse BCI paradigms. However, these
approaches overlook fundamental paradigm-specific neurophysiological
distinctions, limiting their generalization ability. Importantly, in practical
BCI deployments, the specific paradigm such as motor imagery (MI) for stroke
rehabilitation or assistive robotics, is generally determined prior to data
acquisition. This paper proposes MIRepNet, the first EEG foundation model
tailored for the MI paradigm. MIRepNet comprises a high-quality EEG
preprocessing pipeline incorporating a neurophysiologically-informed channel
template, adaptable to EEG headsets with arbitrary electrode configurations.
Furthermore, we introduce a hybrid pretraining strategy that combines
self-supervised masked token reconstruction and supervised MI classification,
facilitating rapid adaptation and accurate decoding on novel downstream MI
tasks with fewer than 30 trials per class. Extensive evaluations across five
public MI datasets demonstrated that MIRepNet consistently achieved
state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming both specialized and
generalized EEG models. Our code will be available on
GitHub\footnote{https://github.com/staraink/MIRepNet}.

TL;DR: L-MCAT是一种基于Transformer的轻量级多模态对比注意力框架，用于无配对多模态卫星数据的标签高效分类，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决遥感图像分类中多模态数据对齐和标签效率低的问题。

Method: 引入Modality-Spectral Adapters（MSA）和Unpaired Multimodal Attention Alignment（U-MAA）机制。

Result: 在SEN12MS数据集上达到95.4%的准确率，参数和计算量大幅减少。

Conclusion: L-MCAT在标签效率、计算效率和鲁棒性方面表现优异，适合实际部署。

Abstract: We propose the Lightweight Multimodal Contrastive Attention Transformer
(L-MCAT), a novel transformer-based framework for label-efficient remote
sensing image classification using unpaired multimodal satellite data. L-MCAT
introduces two core innovations: (1) Modality-Spectral Adapters (MSA) that
compress high-dimensional sensor inputs into a unified embedding space, and (2)
Unpaired Multimodal Attention Alignment (U-MAA), a contrastive self-supervised
mechanism integrated into the attention layers to align heterogeneous
modalities without pixel-level correspondence or labels. L-MCAT achieves 95.4%
overall accuracy on the SEN12MS dataset using only 20 labels per class,
outperforming state-of-the-art baselines while using 47x fewer parameters and
23x fewer FLOPs than MCTrans. It maintains over 92% accuracy even under 50%
spatial misalignment, demonstrating robustness for real-world deployment. The
model trains end-to-end in under 5 hours on a single consumer GPU.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为可控特征白化的框架，通过消除目标与偏差特征之间的线性相关性，显著减少了偏差，且无需建模高阶依赖关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着人工智能的广泛应用，开发可信赖的AI变得至关重要。然而，深度神经网络容易学习数据集中的虚假相关性，影响了可靠性。

Method: 通过量化目标与偏差特征的线性相关性（协方差矩阵），并利用白化模块消除这种相关性。该方法无需正则化项或对抗学习。

Result: 在四个基准数据集（Corrupted CIFAR-10、Biased FFHQ、WaterBirds和Celeb-A）上验证了方法的优越性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过调整加权系数，有效平衡了算法的效用与公平性，且优于现有方法。

Abstract: As the use of artificial intelligence rapidly increases, the development of
trustworthy artificial intelligence has become important. However, recent
studies have shown that deep neural networks are susceptible to learn spurious
correlations present in datasets. To improve the reliability, we propose a
simple yet effective framework called controllable feature whitening. We
quantify the linear correlation between the target and bias features by the
covariance matrix, and eliminate it through the whitening module. Our results
systemically demonstrate that removing the linear correlations between features
fed into the last linear classifier significantly mitigates the bias, while
avoiding the need to model intractable higher-order dependencies. A particular
advantage of the proposed method is that it does not require regularization
terms or adversarial learning, which often leads to unstable optimization in
practice. Furthermore, we show that two fairness criteria, demographic parity
and equalized odds, can be effectively handled by whitening with the
re-weighted covariance matrix. Consequently, our method controls the trade-off
between the utility and fairness of algorithms by adjusting the weighting
coefficient. Finally, we validate that our method outperforms existing
approaches on four benchmark datasets: Corrupted CIFAR-10, Biased FFHQ,
WaterBirds, and Celeb-A.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种Transfer VAE Training (TVT)策略，通过将8倍下采样的VAE转换为4倍下采样，以改善图像超分辨率中细粒度结构的重建问题，同时降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于稳定扩散模型的方法在图像超分辨率中因VAE的高下采样率（8倍）导致细粒度结构（如小字符和纹理）重建效果不佳。

Method: 提出TVT策略，先训练一个4倍下采样的解码器，再训练一个4倍下采样的编码器，同时优化VAE和UNet的网络结构以减少计算成本。

Result: 实验表明，TVT方法显著提升了细粒度结构的保留效果，且计算成本低于现有的一步扩散模型。

Conclusion: TVT策略有效解决了细粒度结构重建问题，同时降低了计算成本，为图像超分辨率提供了新思路。

Abstract: Impressive results on real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) have been
achieved by employing pre-trained stable diffusion (SD) models. However, one
critical issue of such methods lies in their poor reconstruction of image fine
structures, such as small characters and textures, due to the aggressive
resolution reduction of the VAE (eg., 8$\times$ downsampling) in the SD model.
One solution is to employ a VAE with a lower downsampling rate for diffusion;
however, adapting its latent features with the pre-trained UNet while
mitigating the increased computational cost poses new challenges. To address
these issues, we propose a Transfer VAE Training (TVT) strategy to transfer the
8$\times$ downsampled VAE into a 4$\times$ one while adapting to the
pre-trained UNet. Specifically, we first train a 4$\times$ decoder based on the
output features of the original VAE encoder, then train a 4$\times$ encoder
while keeping the newly trained decoder fixed. Such a TVT strategy aligns the
new encoder-decoder pair with the original VAE latent space while enhancing
image fine details. Additionally, we introduce a compact VAE and
compute-efficient UNet by optimizing their network architectures, reducing the
computational cost while capturing high-resolution fine-scale features.
Experimental results demonstrate that our TVT method significantly improves
fine-structure preservation, which is often compromised by other SD-based
methods, while requiring fewer FLOPs than state-of-the-art one-step diffusion
models. The official code can be found at https://github.com/Joyies/TVT.

*Zeyu Xia,Chenxi Sun,Tianyu Xin,Yubo Zeng,Haoyu Chen,Liang-Jian Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种快速跨传感器适应框架SWIFT，通过无监督采样和敏感权重更新，显著减少适应时间并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习模型在跨传感器数据上性能下降的问题，避免昂贵的全量重新训练。

Method: 采用无监督采样策略选择目标域中最具信息量的样本，分析梯度行为识别并更新敏感权重。

Result: SWIFT将适应时间从小时级缩短至约一分钟，性能优于直接迁移基准，甚至媲美全量重新训练。

Conclusion: SWIFT为跨传感器图像融合提供了一种高效、通用的解决方案，显著提升了模型适应性和性能。

Abstract: Pansharpening aims to fuse high-resolution panchromatic (PAN) images with
low-resolution multispectral (LRMS) images to generate high-resolution
multispectral (HRMS) images. Although deep learning-based methods have achieved
promising performance, they generally suffer from severe performance
degradation when applied to data from unseen sensors. Adapting these models
through full-scale retraining or designing more complex architectures is often
prohibitively expensive and impractical for real-world deployment. To address
this critical challenge, we propose a fast and general-purpose framework for
cross-sensor adaptation, SWIFT (Sensitive Weight Identification for Fast
Transfer). Specifically, SWIFT employs an unsupervised sampling strategy based
on data manifold structures to balance sample selection while mitigating the
bias of traditional Farthest Point Sampling, efficiently selecting only 3\% of
the most informative samples from the target domain. This subset is then used
to probe a source-domain pre-trained model by analyzing the gradient behavior
of its parameters, allowing for the quick identification and subsequent update
of only the weight subset most sensitive to the domain shift. As a
plug-and-play framework, SWIFT can be applied to various existing pansharpening
models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SWIFT reduces the adaptation
time from hours to approximately one minute on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU.
The adapted models not only substantially outperform direct-transfer baselines
but also achieve performance competitive with, and in some cases superior to,
full retraining, establishing a new state-of-the-art on cross-sensor
pansharpening tasks for the WorldView-2 and QuickBird datasets.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合3D渲染和2D扩散模型的混合方法，用于在动态视频中插入3D对象，以实现时间一致性和真实光照效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在动态场景中插入3D对象时的时间一致性和真实光照问题，弥补2D扩散模型和传统3D渲染方法的不足。

Method: 使用3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）进行初始渲染以确保时间一致性，再通过2D扩散模型增强光照效果，并优化多帧加权调整。

Result: 实现了在动态视频中插入3D对象的高时间一致性和真实光照效果。

Conclusion: 该方法首次结合了3D渲染和2D扩散模型，为视频对象插入提供了高效且逼真的解决方案。

Abstract: Inserting 3D objects into videos is a longstanding challenge in computer
graphics with applications in augmented reality, virtual try-on, and video
composition. Achieving both temporal consistency, or realistic lighting remains
difficult, particularly in dynamic scenarios with complex object motion,
perspective changes, and varying illumination. While 2D diffusion models have
shown promise for producing photorealistic edits, they often struggle with
maintaining temporal coherence across frames. Conversely, traditional 3D
rendering methods excel in spatial and temporal consistency but fall short in
achieving photorealistic lighting. In this work, we propose a hybrid object
insertion pipeline that combines the strengths of both paradigms. Specifically,
we focus on inserting bracelets into dynamic wrist scenes, leveraging the high
temporal consistency of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for initial rendering and
refining the results using a 2D diffusion-based enhancement model to ensure
realistic lighting interactions. Our method introduces a shading-driven
pipeline that separates intrinsic object properties (albedo, shading,
reflectance) and refines both shading and sRGB images for photorealism. To
maintain temporal coherence, we optimize the 3DGS model with multi-frame
weighted adjustments. This is the first approach to synergize 3D rendering and
2D diffusion for video object insertion, offering a robust solution for
realistic and consistent video editing. Project Page:

Abstract: Non-rigid registration is essential for Augmented Reality guided laparoscopic
liver surgery by fusing preoperative information, such as tumor location and
vascular structures, into the limited intraoperative view, thereby enhancing
surgical navigation. A prerequisite is the accurate prediction of
intraoperative liver deformation which remains highly challenging due to
factors such as large deformation caused by pneumoperitoneum, respiration and
tool interaction as well as noisy intraoperative data, and limited field of
view due to occlusion and constrained camera movement. To address these
challenges, we introduce PIVOTS, a Preoperative to Intraoperative
VOlume-To-Surface registration neural network that directly takes point clouds
as input for deformation prediction. The geometric feature extraction encoder
allows multi-resolution feature extraction, and the decoder, comprising novel
deformation aware cross attention modules, enables pre- and intraoperative
information interaction and accurate multi-level displacement prediction. We
train the neural network on synthetic data simulated from a biomechanical
simulation pipeline and validate its performance on both synthetic and real
datasets. Results demonstrate superior registration performance of our method
compared to baseline methods, exhibiting strong robustness against high amounts
of noise, large deformation, and various levels of intraoperative visibility.
We publish the training and test sets as evaluation benchmarks and call for a
fair comparison of liver registration methods with volume-to-surface data. Code

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种针对增强现实（AR）中视觉信息操纵（VIM）攻击的分类和检测方法，构建了数据集AR-VIM，并开发了多模态语义推理框架VIM-Sense，检测准确率达88.94%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AR中的虚拟内容可能引入误导或有害信息，导致语义误解或用户错误，因此需要研究VIM攻击的分类和检测方法。

Method: 提出了一种分类法，将VIM攻击分为三种格式（字符、短语、模式操纵）和三种目的（信息替换、信息混淆、额外错误信息）。基于此构建了数据集AR-VIM，并开发了多模态框架VIM-Sense，结合视觉语言模型和OCR技术。

Result: VIM-Sense在AR-VIM数据集上的检测准确率为88.94%，优于仅视觉或仅文本的基线方法，检测延迟约为7秒。

Conclusion: VIM-Sense能有效检测AR中的VIM攻击，为AR安全提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: The virtual content in augmented reality (AR) can introduce misleading or
harmful information, leading to semantic misunderstandings or user errors. In
this work, we focus on visual information manipulation (VIM) attacks in AR
where virtual content changes the meaning of real-world scenes in subtle but
impactful ways. We introduce a taxonomy that categorizes these attacks into
three formats: character, phrase, and pattern manipulation, and three purposes:
information replacement, information obfuscation, and extra wrong information.
Based on the taxonomy, we construct a dataset, AR-VIM. It consists of 452
raw-AR video pairs spanning 202 different scenes, each simulating a real-world
AR scenario. To detect such attacks, we propose a multimodal semantic reasoning
framework, VIM-Sense. It combines the language and visual understanding
capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) with optical character
recognition (OCR)-based textual analysis. VIM-Sense achieves an attack
detection accuracy of 88.94% on AR-VIM, consistently outperforming vision-only
and text-only baselines. The system reaches an average attack detection latency
of 7.07 seconds in a simulated video processing framework and 7.17 seconds in a
real-world evaluation conducted on a mobile Android AR application.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 面部美观预测（FBP）因主观性和复杂特征而具有挑战性，现有方法难以提取与美学评估对齐的特征。

Method: 使用Diffusion Transformer在大规模无标签面部数据集（FFHQ）上进行自监督去噪预训练，然后冻结编码器并微调轻量回归头。

Result: 在FBP5500基准测试中，Diff-FBP的Pearson相关系数（PCC）达到0.932，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 生成式预训练策略是关键，能提取更适合主观视觉任务的特征表示。

Abstract: Facial Beauty Prediction (FBP) is a challenging computer vision task due to
its subjective nature and the subtle, holistic features that influence human
perception. Prevailing methods, often based on deep convolutional networks or
standard Vision Transformers pre-trained on generic object classification
(e.g., ImageNet), struggle to learn feature representations that are truly
aligned with high-level aesthetic assessment. In this paper, we propose a novel
two-stage framework that leverages the power of generative models to create a
superior, domain-specific feature extractor. In the first stage, we pre-train a
Diffusion Transformer on a large-scale, unlabeled facial dataset (FFHQ) through
a self-supervised denoising task. This process forces the model to learn the
fundamental data distribution of human faces, capturing nuanced details and
structural priors essential for aesthetic evaluation. In the second stage, the
pre-trained and frozen encoder of our Diffusion Transformer is used as a
backbone feature extractor, with only a lightweight regression head being
fine-tuned on the target FBP dataset (FBP5500). Our method, termed Diff-FBP,
sets a new state-of-the-art on the FBP5500 benchmark, achieving a Pearson
Correlation Coefficient (PCC) of 0.932, significantly outperforming prior art
based on general-purpose pre-training. Extensive ablation studies validate that
our generative pre-training strategy is the key contributor to this performance
leap, creating feature representations that are more semantically potent for
subjective visual tasks.

Motivation: 低光图像增强任务因噪声、细节丢失和对比度差而具有挑战性，现有方法仅依赖RGB图像的像素级变换，忽略了多模态的上下文信息。

Method: 提出ModalFormer框架，包含跨模态Transformer（CM-T）和多个辅助子网络，通过CM-MSA机制融合RGB数据与多种模态特征。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上展示了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: ModalFormer通过充分利用多模态信息，显著提升了低光图像增强的效果。

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) is a fundamental yet challenging task due
to the presence of noise, loss of detail, and poor contrast in images captured
under insufficient lighting conditions. Recent methods often rely solely on
pixel-level transformations of RGB images, neglecting the rich contextual
information available from multiple visual modalities. In this paper, we
present ModalFormer, the first large-scale multimodal framework for LLIE that
fully exploits nine auxiliary modalities to achieve state-of-the-art
performance. Our model comprises two main components: a Cross-modal Transformer
(CM-T) designed to restore corrupted images while seamlessly integrating
multimodal information, and multiple auxiliary subnetworks dedicated to
multimodal feature reconstruction. Central to the CM-T is our novel Cross-modal
Multi-headed Self-Attention mechanism (CM-MSA), which effectively fuses RGB
data with modality-specific features--including deep feature embeddings,
segmentation information, geometric cues, and color information--to generate
information-rich hybrid attention maps. Extensive experiments on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate ModalFormer's state-of-the-art performance in
LLIE. Pre-trained models and results are made available at

Conclusion: 研究表明深度学习模型在印度驾驶数据集上有效，为自动驾驶场景理解提供了参考。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles are the next revolution in the automobile industry and
they are expected to revolutionize the future of transportation. Understanding
the scenario in which the autonomous vehicle will operate is critical for its
competent functioning. Deep Learning has played a massive role in the progress
that has been made till date. Semantic Segmentation, the process of annotating
every pixel of an image with an object class, is one crucial part of this scene
comprehension using Deep Learning. It is especially useful in Autonomous
Driving Research as it requires comprehension of drivable and non-drivable
areas, roadside objects and the like. In this paper semantic segmentation has
been performed on the Indian Driving Dataset which has been recently compiled
on the urban and rural roads of Bengaluru and Hyderabad. This dataset is more
challenging compared to other datasets like Cityscapes, since it is based on
unstructured driving environments. It has a four level hierarchy and in this
paper segmentation has been performed on the first level. Five different models
have been trained and their performance has been compared using the Mean
Intersection over Union. These are UNET, UNET+RESNET50, DeepLabsV3, PSPNet and
SegNet. The highest MIOU of 0.6496 has been achieved. The paper discusses the
dataset, exploratory data analysis, preparation, implementation of the five
models and studies the performance and compares the results achieved in the
process.

Conclusion: VESPA展示了在无需真实标注或高清地图的情况下，实现高质量3D伪标注和可扩展场景理解的潜力。

Abstract: Data collection for autonomous driving is rapidly accelerating, but manual
annotation, especially for 3D labels, remains a major bottleneck due to its
high cost and labor intensity. Autolabeling has emerged as a scalable
alternative, allowing the generation of labels for point clouds with minimal
human intervention. While LiDAR-based autolabeling methods leverage geometric
information, they struggle with inherent limitations of lidar data, such as
sparsity, occlusions, and incomplete object observations. Furthermore, these
methods typically operate in a class-agnostic manner, offering limited semantic
granularity. To address these challenges, we introduce VESPA, a multimodal
autolabeling pipeline that fuses the geometric precision of LiDAR with the
semantic richness of camera images. Our approach leverages vision-language
models (VLMs) to enable open-vocabulary object labeling and to refine detection
quality directly in the point cloud domain. VESPA supports the discovery of
novel categories and produces high-quality 3D pseudolabels without requiring
ground-truth annotations or HD maps. On Nuscenes dataset, VESPA achieves an AP
of 52.95% for object discovery and up to 46.54% for multiclass object
detection, demonstrating strong performance in scalable 3D scene understanding.
Code will be available upon acceptance.

an Average Ranking and Equal Error rate (EER) of AV-Rank of 40.48% and 11.44%
EER, respectively. For the more challenging approach in Track 2, the "Incode"
team reached the best results with an AV-Rank of 14.76% and 6.36% EER,
improving on the results of the first edition of 74.30% and 21.87% EER,

Conclusion: 该研究为聋哑社区提供了一种高效的实时沟通解决方案，技术表现卓越。

Abstract: Gestural language is used by deaf & mute communities to communicate through
hand gestures & body movements that rely on visual-spatial patterns known as
sign languages. Sign languages, which rely on visual-spatial patterns of hand
gestures & body movements, are the primary mode of communication for deaf &
mute communities worldwide. Effective communication is fundamental to human
interaction, yet individuals in these communities often face significant
barriers due to a scarcity of skilled interpreters & accessible translation
technologies. This research specifically addresses these challenges within the
Indian context by focusing on Indian Sign Language (ISL). By leveraging machine
learning, this study aims to bridge the critical communication gap for the deaf
& hard-of-hearing population in India, where technological solutions for ISL
are less developed compared to other global sign languages. We propose a
robust, real-time ISL detection & translation system built upon a Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN). Our model is trained on a comprehensive ISL dataset &
demonstrates exceptional performance, achieving a classification accuracy of
99.95%. This high precision underscores the model's capability to discern the
nuanced visual features of different signs. The system's effectiveness is
rigorously evaluated using key performance metrics, including accuracy, F1
score, precision & recall, ensuring its reliability for real-world
applications. For real-time implementation, the framework integrates MediaPipe
for precise hand tracking & motion detection, enabling seamless translation of
dynamic gestures. This paper provides a detailed account of the model's
architecture, the data preprocessing pipeline & the classification methodology.
The research elaborates the model architecture, preprocessing & classification
methodologies for enhancing communication in deaf & mute communities.

Conclusion: 基础模型为小数据条件下的工作适应性预测提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Biometric capture devices have been utilised to estimate a person's alertness
through near-infrared iris images, expanding their use beyond just biometric
recognition. However, capturing a substantial number of corresponding images
related to alcohol consumption, drug use, and sleep deprivation to create a
dataset for training an AI model presents a significant challenge. Typically, a
large quantity of images is required to effectively implement a deep learning
approach. Currently, training downstream models with a huge number of images
based on foundational models provides a real opportunity to enhance this area,
thanks to the generalisation capabilities of self-supervised models. This work
examines the application of deep learning and foundational models in predicting
fitness for duty, which is defined as the subject condition related to
determining the alertness for work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非手动面部特征在手语交流中至关重要，但在自动手语识别（ASLR）中尚未充分探索其作用。

Method: 使用两种深度学习模型（CNN和Transformer）系统评估不同面部区域（眼睛、嘴部和全脸）的贡献，并通过定量和定性分析验证。

Result: 嘴部是最重要的非手动面部特征，显著提高了识别准确率。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在ASLR中纳入面部特征的必要性。

Abstract: Non-manual facial features play a crucial role in sign language
communication, yet their importance in automatic sign language recognition
(ASLR) remains underexplored. While prior studies have shown that incorporating
facial features can improve recognition, related work often relies on
hand-crafted feature extraction and fails to go beyond the comparison of manual
features versus the combination of manual and facial features. In this work, we
systematically investigate the contribution of distinct facial regionseyes,
mouth, and full faceusing two different deep learning models (a CNN-based model
and a transformer-based model) trained on an SLR dataset of isolated signs with
randomly selected classes. Through quantitative performance and qualitative
saliency map evaluation, we reveal that the mouth is the most important
non-manual facial feature, significantly improving accuracy. Our findings
highlight the necessity of incorporating facial features in ASLR.

Abstract: In this work, we revisit the effectiveness of 3DMM for talking head synthesis
by jointly learning a 3D face reconstruction model and a talking head synthesis
model. This enables us to obtain a FACS-based blendshape representation of
facial expressions that is optimized for talking head synthesis. This contrasts
with previous methods that either fit 3DMM parameters to 2D landmarks or rely
on pretrained face reconstruction models. Not only does our approach increase
the quality of the generated face, but it also allows us to take advantage of
the blendshape representation to modify just the mouth region for the purpose
of audio-based lip-sync. To this end, we propose a novel lip-sync pipeline
that, unlike previous methods, decouples the original chin contour from the
lip-synced chin contour, and reduces flickering near the mouth.

Result: 在Infinity-2B中，SparseVAR实现了2倍加速且质量损失极小。

Conclusion: SparseVAR显著降低了计算成本，同时保持了高图像生成质量。

Abstract: Visual autoregressive modeling, based on the next-scale prediction paradigm,
exhibits notable advantages in image quality and model scalability over
traditional autoregressive and diffusion models. It generates images by
progressively refining resolution across multiple stages. However, the
computational overhead in high-resolution stages remains a critical challenge
due to the substantial number of tokens involved. In this paper, we introduce
SparseVAR, a plug-and-play acceleration framework for next-scale prediction
that dynamically excludes low-frequency tokens during inference without
requiring additional training. Our approach is motivated by the observation
that tokens in low-frequency regions have a negligible impact on image quality
in high-resolution stages and exhibit strong similarity with neighboring
tokens. Additionally, we observe that different blocks in the next-scale
prediction model focus on distinct regions, with some concentrating on
high-frequency areas. SparseVAR leverages these insights by employing
lightweight MSE-based metrics to identify low-frequency tokens while preserving
the fidelity of excluded regions through a small set of uniformly sampled
anchor tokens. By significantly reducing the computational cost while
maintaining high image generation quality, SparseVAR achieves notable
acceleration in both HART and Infinity. Specifically, SparseVAR achieves up to
a 2 times speedup with minimal quality degradation in Infinity-2B.

Conclusion: $A^2R^2$通过视觉推理和迭代优化显著提升了Img2LaTeX任务的性能，展示了其实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Img2LaTeX is a practically significant task that involves converting
mathematical expressions or tabular data from images into LaTeX code. In recent
years, vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance
across a variety of visual understanding tasks, owing to their generalization
capabilities. While some studies have explored the use of VLMs for the
Img2LaTeX task, their performance often falls short of expectations.
Empirically, VLMs sometimes struggle with fine-grained visual elements, leading
to inaccurate LaTeX predictions. To address this challenge, we propose
$A^2R^2$: Advancing Img2LaTeX Conversion via Visual Reasoning with
Attention-Guided Refinement, a framework that effectively integrates attention
localization and iterative refinement within a visual reasoning framework,
enabling VLMs to perform self-correction and progressively improve prediction
quality. For effective evaluation, we introduce a new dataset,
Img2LaTex-Hard-1K, consisting of 1,100 carefully curated and challenging
examples designed to rigorously evaluate the capabilities of VLMs within this
task domain. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that: (1) $A^2R^2$
significantly improves model performance across six evaluation metrics spanning
both textual and visual levels, consistently outperforming other baseline
methods; (2) Increasing the number of inference rounds yields notable
performance gains, underscoring the potential of $A^2R^2$ in test-time scaling
scenarios; (3) Ablation studies and human evaluations validate the practical
effectiveness of our approach, as well as the strong synergy among its core
components during inference.

Result: 实验表明，该方法有效减少误诊并在多类别场景中优先考虑重要症状。

Conclusion: 新方法通过层次结构和特征复用，提升了临床MIL任务的优先级处理能力。

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is increasingly being used as a support tool
within clinical settings for pathological diagnosis decisions, achieving high
performance and removing the annotation burden. However, existing approaches
for clinical MIL tasks have not adequately addressed the priority issues that
exist in relation to pathological symptoms and diagnostic classes, causing MIL
models to ignore priority among classes. To overcome this clinical limitation
of MIL, we propose a new method that addresses priority issues using two
hierarchies: vertical inter-hierarchy and horizontal intra-hierarchy. The
proposed method aligns MIL predictions across each hierarchical level and
employs an implicit feature re-usability during training to facilitate
clinically more serious classes within the same level. Experiments with
real-world patient data show that the proposed method effectively reduces
misdiagnosis and prioritizes more important symptoms in multiclass scenarios.
Further analysis verifies the efficacy of the proposed components and
qualitatively confirms the MIL predictions against challenging cases with
multiple symptoms.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了场景对齐和重建保真度，适用于机器人感知和自主导航。

Abstract: In recent years, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS)-based scene representation
demonstrates significant potential in real-time rendering and training
efficiency. However, most existing methods primarily focus on single-map
reconstruction, while the registration and fusion of multiple 3D-GS sub-maps
remain underexplored. Existing methods typically rely on manual intervention to
select a reference sub-map as a template and use point cloud matching for
registration. Moreover, hard-threshold filtering of 3D-GS primitives often
degrades rendering quality after fusion. In this paper, we present a novel
approach for automated 3D-GS sub-map alignment and fusion, eliminating the need
for manual intervention while enhancing registration accuracy and fusion
quality. First, we extract geometric skeletons across multiple scenes and
leverage ellipsoid-aware convolution to capture 3D-GS attributes, facilitating
robust scene registration. Second, we introduce a multi-factor Gaussian fusion
strategy to mitigate the scene element loss caused by rigid thresholding.
Experiments on the ScanNet-GSReg and our Coord datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method in registration and fusion. For
registration, it achieves a 41.9\% reduction in RRE on complex scenes, ensuring
more precise pose estimation. For fusion, it improves PSNR by 10.11 dB,
highlighting superior structural preservation. These results confirm its
ability to enhance scene alignment and reconstruction fidelity, ensuring more
consistent and accurate 3D scene representation for robotic perception and
autonomous navigation.

Abstract: Accurately detecting rice flowering time is crucial for timely pollination in
hybrid rice seed production. This not only enhances pollination efficiency but
also ensures higher yields. However, due to the complexity of field
environments and the characteristics of rice spikelets, such as their small
size and short flowering period, automated and precise recognition remains
challenging. To address this, this study proposes a rice spikelet flowering
recognition method based on an improved YOLOv8 object detection model. First, a
Bidirectional Feature Pyramid Network (BiFPN) replaces the original PANet
structure to enhance feature fusion and improve multi-scale feature
utilization. Second, to boost small object detection, a p2 small-object
detection head is added, using finer feature mapping to reduce feature loss
commonly seen in detecting small targets. Given the lack of publicly available
datasets for rice spikelet flowering in field conditions, a high-resolution RGB
camera and data augmentation techniques are used to construct a dedicated
dataset, providing reliable support for model training and testing.
Experimental results show that the improved YOLOv8s-p2 model achieves an
mAP@0.5 of 65.9%, precision of 67.6%, recall of 61.5%, and F1-score of 64.41%,
representing improvements of 3.10%, 8.40%, 10.80%, and 9.79%, respectively,
over the baseline YOLOv8. The model also runs at 69 f/s on the test set,
meeting practical application requirements. Overall, the improved YOLOv8s-p2
offers high accuracy and speed, providing an effective solution for automated
monitoring in hybrid rice seed production.

Abstract: Capturing spatial context at multiple scales is crucial for deep
learning-based sea ice segmentation. However, the optimal specification of
spatial context based on observation resolution and task characteristics
remains underexplored. This study investigates the impact of spatial context on
the segmentation of sea ice concentration, stage of development, and floe size
using a multi-task segmentation model. We implement Atrous Spatial Pyramid
Pooling with varying atrous rates to systematically control the receptive field
size of convolutional operations, and to capture multi-scale contextual
information. We explore the interactions between spatial context and feature
resolution for different sea ice properties and examine how spatial context
influences segmentation performance across different input feature combinations
from Sentinel-1 SAR and Advanced Microwave Radiometer-2 (AMSR2) for multi-task
mapping. Using Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping, we visualize how
atrous rates influence model decisions. Our findings indicate that smaller
receptive fields excel for high-resolution Sentinel-1 data, while medium
receptive fields yield better performances for stage of development
segmentation and larger receptive fields often lead to diminished performances.
The fusion of SAR and AMSR2 enhances segmentation across all tasks. We
highlight the value of lower-resolution 18.7 and 36.5 GHz AMSR2 channels in sea
ice mapping. These findings highlight the importance of selecting appropriate
spatial context based on observation resolution and target properties in sea
ice mapping. By systematically analyzing receptive field effects in a
multi-task setting, our study provides insights for optimizing deep learning
models in geospatial applications.

Conclusion: BCT-CLIP通过主导属性和对比学习，显著提升了少样本学习的分类效果。

Abstract: Few-shot Learning (FSL), which endeavors to develop the generalization
ability for recognizing novel classes using only a few images, faces
significant challenges due to data scarcity. Recent CLIP-like methods based on
contrastive language-image pertaining mitigate the issue by leveraging textual
representation of the class name for unseen image discovery. Despite the
achieved success, simply aligning visual representations to class name
embeddings would compromise the visual diversity for novel class
discrimination. To this end, we proposed a novel Few-Shot Learning (FSL) method
(BCT-CLIP) that explores \textbf{dominating properties} via contrastive
learning beyond simply using class tokens. Through leveraging LLM-based prior
knowledge, our method pushes forward FSL with comprehensive structural image
representations, including both global category representation and the
patch-aware property embeddings. In particular, we presented a novel
multi-property generator (MPG) with patch-aware cross-attentions to generate
multiple visual property tokens, a Large-Language Model (LLM)-assistant
retrieval procedure with clustering-based pruning to obtain dominating property
descriptions, and a new contrastive learning strategy for property-token
learning. The superior performances on the 11 widely used datasets demonstrate
that our investigation of dominating properties advances discriminative
class-specific representation learning and few-shot classification.

Abstract: We propose a 3D Gaussian splatting-based framework for outdoor relighting
that leverages intrinsic image decomposition to precisely integrate sunlight,
sky radiance, and indirect lighting from unconstrained photo collections.
Unlike prior methods that compress the per-image global illumination into a
single latent vector, our approach enables simultaneously diverse shading
manipulation and the generation of dynamic shadow effects. This is achieved
through three key innovations: (1) a residual-based sun visibility extraction
method to accurately separate direct sunlight effects, (2) a region-based
supervision framework with a structural consistency loss for physically
interpretable and coherent illumination decomposition, and (3) a
ray-tracing-based technique for realistic shadow simulation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework synthesizes novel views with
competitive fidelity against state-of-the-art relighting solutions and produces
more natural and multifaceted illumination and shadow effects.

Benchmark), a benchmark for evaluating VLM models across seven agricultural
topics, covering key areas in agricultural engineering and relevant to
real-world farming. Unlike recent agricultural VLM benchmarks, AgroBench is
annotated by expert agronomists. Our AgroBench covers a state-of-the-art range
of categories, including 203 crop categories and 682 disease categories, to
thoroughly evaluate VLM capabilities. In our evaluation on AgroBench, we reveal
that VLMs have room for improvement in fine-grained identification tasks.
Notably, in weed identification, most open-source VLMs perform close to random.
With our wide range of topics and expert-annotated categories, we analyze the
types of errors made by VLMs and suggest potential pathways for future VLM

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉语言模型（VLMs）发展迅速，但在空间推理任务中表现不佳，因此需要一种新方法来提升其能力。

Method: SpatialVTS方法分为空间视觉思维和空间文本思维两个阶段：前者生成与位置相关的特定标记，后者基于视觉线索和对话进行长期推理。

Result: 模型在多个空间理解任务中的平均表现显著优于其他模型，且未引入额外信息（如掩码或深度）。

Conclusion: SpatialVTS方法通过视觉和文本双重思维有效提升了空间推理能力，为VQA和机器人任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: The spatial reasoning task aims to reason about the spatial relationships in
2D and 3D space, which is a fundamental capability for Visual Question
Answering (VQA) and robotics. Although vision language models (VLMs) have
developed rapidly in recent years, they are still struggling with the spatial
reasoning task. In this paper, we introduce a method that can enhance Spatial
reasoning through Visual and Textual thinking Simultaneously (SpatialVTS). In
the spatial visual thinking phase, our model is trained to generate
location-related specific tokens of essential targets automatically. Not only
are the objects mentioned in the problem addressed, but also the potential
objects related to the reasoning are considered. During the spatial textual
thinking phase, Our model conducts long-term thinking based on visual cues and
dialogues, gradually inferring the answers to spatial reasoning problems. To
effectively support the model's training, we perform manual corrections to the
existing spatial reasoning dataset, eliminating numerous incorrect labels
resulting from automatic annotation, restructuring the data input format to
enhance generalization ability, and developing thinking processes with logical
reasoning details. Without introducing additional information (such as masks or
depth), our model's overall average level in several spatial understanding
tasks has significantly improved compared with other models.

grain classification system for green lentils (Lens Culinaris), which leverages
computer vision and pneumatic ejection. The system integrates a YOLOv8-based
detection model that identifies and locates grains on a conveyor belt, together
with a second YOLOv8-based classification model that categorises grains into
six classes: Good, Yellow, Broken, Peeled, Dotted, and Reject. This two-stage
YOLOv8 pipeline enables accurate, real-time, multi-class categorisation of
lentils, implemented on a low-cost, modular hardware platform. The pneumatic
ejection mechanism separates defective grains, while an Arduino-based control
system coordinates real-time interaction between the vision system and
mechanical components. The system operates effectively at a conveyor speed of
59 mm/s, achieving a grain separation accuracy of 87.2%. Despite a limited
processing rate of 8 grams per minute, the prototype demonstrates the potential
of machine vision for grain sorting and provides a modular foundation for
future enhancements.

### [249] [T2I-Copilot: A Training-Free Multi-Agent Text-to-Image System for Enhanced Prompt Interpretation and Interactive Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20536)
*Chieh-Yun Chen,Min Shi,Gong Zhang,Humphrey Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: T2I-Copilot是一个无需训练的多代理系统，通过多模态大语言模型协作自动优化文本到图像生成的提示词、模型选择和迭代优化，显著提升生成质量和文本-图像对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像生成模型对提示词敏感，需要反复调整且缺乏明确反馈，现有方法控制性有限或需额外训练。

Method: T2I-Copilot由三个代理组成：输入解析器、生成引擎和质量评估器，分别负责解析输入、选择模型并生成、评估生成结果。

Result: 在开源模型上，T2I-Copilot的VQA得分接近商业模型，成本仅为FLUX1.1-pro的16.59%，性能超越多个基准模型。

Conclusion: T2I-Copilot通过多代理协作实现了高效、低成本的文本到图像生成优化，支持全自动和人工干预模式。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) generative models have revolutionized content creation
but remain highly sensitive to prompt phrasing, often requiring users to
repeatedly refine prompts multiple times without clear feedback. While
techniques such as automatic prompt engineering, controlled text embeddings,
denoising, and multi-turn generation mitigate these issues, they offer limited
controllability, or often necessitate additional training, restricting the
generalization abilities. Thus, we introduce T2I-Copilot, a training-free
multi-agent system that leverages collaboration between (Multimodal) Large
Language Models to automate prompt phrasing, model selection, and iterative
refinement. This approach significantly simplifies prompt engineering while
enhancing generation quality and text-image alignment compared to direct
generation. Specifically, T2I-Copilot consists of three agents: (1) Input
Interpreter, which parses the input prompt, resolves ambiguities, and generates
a standardized report; (2) Generation Engine, which selects the appropriate
model from different types of T2I models and organizes visual and textual
prompts to initiate generation; and (3) Quality Evaluator, which assesses
aesthetic quality and text-image alignment, providing scores and feedback for
potential regeneration. T2I-Copilot can operate fully autonomously while also
supporting human-in-the-loop intervention for fine-grained control. On
GenAI-Bench, using open-source generation models, T2I-Copilot achieves a VQA
score comparable to commercial models RecraftV3 and Imagen 3, surpasses
FLUX1.1-pro by 6.17% at only 16.59% of its cost, and outperforms FLUX.1-dev and
SD 3.5 Large by 9.11% and 6.36%. Code will be released at:

*Lan Yang,Kaiyue Pang,Honggang Zhang,Yi-Zhe Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文首次研究了草图质量评估，提出了一种基于特征幅度的定量质量度量方法（GACL），无需人工标注即可实现，并在多个应用中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决草图质量评估的缺失问题，尤其是如何量化评估手绘草图的质量。

Method: 提出Geometry-Aware Classification Layer (GACL)，通过特征幅度的L2范数作为质量度量，结合可识别性学习，无需人工标注。

Result: GACL与人类质量感知一致，并成功应用于草图质量评估、图像质量评估（IQA）和噪声标签清理。

Conclusion: GACL是一种通用方法，适用于多种视觉表示，并展示了广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: As lovely as bunnies are, your sketched version would probably not do them
justice (Fig.~\ref{fig:intro}). This paper recognises this very problem and
studies sketch quality assessment for the first time -- letting you find these
badly drawn ones. Our key discovery lies in exploiting the magnitude ($L_2$
norm) of a sketch feature as a quantitative quality metric. We propose
Geometry-Aware Classification Layer (GACL), a generic method that makes
feature-magnitude-as-quality-metric possible and importantly does it without
the need for specific quality annotations from humans. GACL sees feature
magnitude and recognisability learning as a dual task, which can be
simultaneously optimised under a neat cross-entropy classification loss with
theoretic guarantee. This gives GACL a nice geometric interpretation (the
better the quality, the easier the recognition), and makes it agnostic to both
network architecture changes and the underlying sketch representation. Through
a large scale human study of 160,000 \doublecheck{trials}, we confirm the
agreement between our GACL-induced metric and human quality perception. We
further demonstrate how such a quality assessment capability can for the first
time enable three practical sketch applications. Interestingly, we show GACL
not only works on abstract visual representations such as sketch but also
extends well to natural images on the problem of image quality assessment
(IQA). Last but not least, we spell out the general properties of GACL as
general-purpose data re-weighting strategy and demonstrate its applications in
vertical problems such as noisy label cleansing. Code will be made publicly
available at github.com/yanglan0225/SketchX-Quantifying-Sketch-Quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出FED-PsyAU框架，结合心理学先验知识和联邦学习，解决微表情识别中的小样本和隐私问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微表情识别面临小样本、隐私保护等挑战，需要高效且隐私安全的解决方案。

Method: 结合心理学研究（面部动作单元协调）和DPK-GAT网络，采用联邦学习框架避免数据共享。

Result: 在常用微表情数据库上验证了方法的有效性，提升了识别性能。

Conclusion: FED-PsyAU框架在微表情识别中兼顾性能和隐私，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are brief, low-intensity, often localized facial
expressions. They could reveal genuine emotions individuals may attempt to
conceal, valuable in contexts like criminal interrogation and psychological
counseling. However, ME recognition (MER) faces challenges, such as small
sample sizes and subtle features, which hinder efficient modeling.
Additionally, real-world applications encounter ME data privacy issues, leaving
the task of enhancing recognition across settings under privacy constraints
largely unexplored. To address these issues, we propose a FED-PsyAU research
framework. We begin with a psychological study on the coordination of upper and
lower facial action units (AUs) to provide structured prior knowledge of facial
muscle dynamics. We then develop a DPK-GAT network that combines these
psychological priors with statistical AU patterns, enabling hierarchical
learning of facial motion features from regional to global levels, effectively
enhancing MER performance. Additionally, our federated learning framework
advances MER capabilities across multiple clients without data sharing,
preserving privacy and alleviating the limited-sample issue for each client.
Extensive experiments on commonly-used ME databases demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach.

*Hyung Kyu Kim,Sangmin Lee,Hak Gu Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MemoryTalker提出了一种仅需音频输入即可生成逼真3D面部动画的方法，无需额外先验信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法依赖额外先验信息（如类别标签或3D面部网格）的问题，提升实用性和个性化表现。

Method: 采用两阶段训练框架：1）记忆通用运动；2）基于音频驱动的说话风格特征进行个性化面部运动合成。

Result: 通过定量、定性评估和用户研究，验证了模型在个性化面部动画上的优越性能。

Conclusion: MemoryTalker在无需额外先验的情况下，实现了逼真且个性化的3D面部动画生成。

Abstract: Speech-driven 3D facial animation aims to synthesize realistic facial motion
sequences from given audio, matching the speaker's speaking style. However,
previous works often require priors such as class labels of a speaker or
additional 3D facial meshes at inference, which makes them fail to reflect the
speaking style and limits their practical use. To address these issues, we
propose MemoryTalker which enables realistic and accurate 3D facial motion
synthesis by reflecting speaking style only with audio input to maximize
usability in applications. Our framework consists of two training stages:
1-stage is storing and retrieving general motion (i.e., Memorizing), and
2-stage is to perform the personalized facial motion synthesis (i.e.,
Animating) with the motion memory stylized by the audio-driven speaking style
feature. In this second stage, our model learns about which facial motion types
should be emphasized for a particular piece of audio. As a result, our
MemoryTalker can generate a reliable personalized facial animation without
additional prior information. With quantitative and qualitative evaluations, as
well as user study, we show the effectiveness of our model and its performance
enhancement for personalized facial animation over state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的语音上下文感知损失函数，用于改善语音驱动的3D面部动画的连续性和自然性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法通过逐帧对齐真实数据最小化重建损失，但忽略了面部运动的连续性，导致动画不自然。

Method: 引入语音上下文感知损失，显式建模语音上下文对音素过渡的影响，并加入音素协同发音权重。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在定量指标和视觉质量上均优于传统重建损失。

Conclusion: 显式建模语音上下文依赖的音素对生成自然的语音驱动3D面部动画至关重要。

Abstract: Speech-driven 3D facial animation aims to generate realistic facial movements
synchronized with audio. Traditional methods primarily minimize reconstruction
loss by aligning each frame with ground-truth. However, this frame-wise
approach often fails to capture the continuity of facial motion, leading to
jittery and unnatural outputs due to coarticulation. To address this, we
propose a novel phonetic context-aware loss, which explicitly models the
influence of phonetic context on viseme transitions. By incorporating a viseme
coarticulation weight, we assign adaptive importance to facial movements based
on their dynamic changes over time, ensuring smoother and perceptually
consistent animations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that replacing the
conventional reconstruction loss with ours improves both quantitative metrics
and visual quality. It highlights the importance of explicitly modeling
phonetic context-dependent visemes in synthesizing natural speech-driven 3D
facial animation. Project page: https://cau-irislab.github.io/interspeech25/

Result: 在NSLSR数据集上验证了算法的优越性，显著提升了检测性能和图像融合质量。

Conclusion: LSFDNet为复杂场景下的船舶检测提供了高效解决方案，填补了SWIR和LWIR图像融合检测领域的空白。

Abstract: Traditional ship detection methods primarily rely on single-modal approaches,
such as visible or infrared images, which limit their application in complex
scenarios involving varying lighting conditions and heavy fog. To address this
issue, we explore the advantages of short-wave infrared (SWIR) and long-wave
infrared (LWIR) in ship detection and propose a novel single-stage image fusion
detection algorithm called LSFDNet. This algorithm leverages feature
interaction between the image fusion and object detection subtask networks,
achieving remarkable detection performance and generating visually impressive
fused images. To further improve the saliency of objects in the fused images
and improve the performance of the downstream detection task, we introduce the
Multi-Level Cross-Fusion (MLCF) module. This module combines object-sensitive
fused features from the detection task and aggregates features across multiple
modalities, scales, and tasks to obtain more semantically rich fused features.
Moreover, we utilize the position prior from the detection task in the Object
Enhancement (OE) loss function, further increasing the retention of object
semantics in the fused images. The detection task also utilizes preliminary
fused features from the fusion task to complement SWIR and LWIR features,
thereby enhancing detection performance. Additionally, we have established a
Nearshore Ship Long-Short Wave Registration (NSLSR) dataset to train effective
SWIR and LWIR image fusion and detection networks, bridging a gap in this
field. We validated the superiority of our proposed single-stage fusion
detection algorithm on two datasets. The source code and dataset are available

Result: 在BraTS2019和BraTS2023数据集上，M-Net在所有关键指标上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: M-Net是一种高效的解决方案，适用于具有时空感知的MRI肿瘤分割任务。

Abstract: MRI tumor segmentation remains a critical challenge in medical imaging, where
volumetric analysis faces unique computational demands due to the complexity of
3D data. The spatially sequential arrangement of adjacent MRI slices provides
valuable information that enhances segmentation continuity and accuracy, yet
this characteristic remains underutilized in many existing models. The spatial
correlations between adjacent MRI slices can be regarded as "temporal-like"
data, similar to frame sequences in video segmentation tasks. To bridge this
gap, we propose M-Net, a flexible framework specifically designed for
sequential image segmentation. M-Net introduces the novel Mesh-Cast mechanism,
which seamlessly integrates arbitrary sequential models into the processing of
both channel and temporal information, thereby systematically capturing the
inherent "temporal-like" spatial correlations between MRI slices. Additionally,
we define an MRI sequential input pattern and design a Two-Phase Sequential
(TPS) training strategy, which first focuses on learning common patterns across
sequences before refining slice-specific feature extraction. This approach
leverages temporal modeling techniques to preserve volumetric contextual
information while avoiding the high computational cost of full 3D convolutions,
thereby enhancing the generalizability and robustness of M-Net in sequential
segmentation tasks. Experiments on the BraTS2019 and BraTS2023 datasets
demonstrate that M-Net outperforms existing methods across all key metrics,
establishing itself as a robust solution for temporally-aware MRI tumor
segmentation.

Conclusion: HYPIR通过创新方法实现了高效高质量的图像修复，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Deep image restoration models aim to learn a mapping from degraded image
space to natural image space. However, they face several critical challenges:
removing degradation, generating realistic details, and ensuring pixel-level
consistency. Over time, three major classes of methods have emerged, including
MSE-based, GAN-based, and diffusion-based methods. However, they fail to
achieve a good balance between restoration quality, fidelity, and speed. We
propose a novel method, HYPIR, to address these challenges. Our solution
pipeline is straightforward: it involves initializing the image restoration
model with a pre-trained diffusion model and then fine-tuning it with
adversarial training. This approach does not rely on diffusion loss, iterative
sampling, or additional adapters. We theoretically demonstrate that
initializing adversarial training from a pre-trained diffusion model positions
the initial restoration model very close to the natural image distribution.
Consequently, this initialization improves numerical stability, avoids mode
collapse, and substantially accelerates the convergence of adversarial
training. Moreover, HYPIR inherits the capabilities of diffusion models with
rich user control, enabling text-guided restoration and adjustable texture
richness. Requiring only a single forward pass, it achieves faster convergence
and inference speed than diffusion-based methods. Extensive experiments show
that HYPIR outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving efficient
and high-quality image restoration.

Abstract: As the development of lightweight deep learning algorithms, various deep
neural network (DNN) models have been proposed for the remote sensing scene
classification (RSSC) application. However, it is still challenging for these
RSSC models to achieve optimal performance among model accuracy, inference
latency, and energy consumption on resource-constrained edge devices. In this
paper, we propose a lightweight RSSC framework, which includes a distilled
global filter network (GFNet) model and an early-exit mechanism designed for
edge devices to achieve state-of-the-art performance. Specifically, we first
apply frequency domain distillation on the GFNet model to reduce model size.
Then we design a dynamic early-exit model tailored for DNN models on edge
devices to further improve model inference efficiency. We evaluate our E3C
model on three edge devices across four datasets. Extensive experimental
results show that it achieves an average of 1.3x speedup on model inference and
over 40% improvement on energy efficiency, while maintaining high

Result: 在UCF-Crime和XD-Violence基准测试中，DAMS框架表现出色，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: DAMS框架通过双路径的互补性和信息融合机制，构建了全面的异常事件表示和识别能力。

Abstract: The goal of video anomaly detection is tantamount to performing
spatio-temporal localization of abnormal events in the video. The multiscale
temporal dependencies, visual-semantic heterogeneity, and the scarcity of
labeled data exhibited by video anomalies collectively present a challenging
research problem in computer vision. This study offers a dual-path architecture
called the Dual-Branch Adaptive Multiscale Spatiotemporal Framework (DAMS),
which is based on multilevel feature decoupling and fusion, enabling efficient
anomaly detection modeling by integrating hierarchical feature learning and
complementary information. The main processing path of this framework
integrates the Adaptive Multiscale Time Pyramid Network (AMTPN) with the
Convolutional Block Attention Mechanism (CBAM). AMTPN enables multigrained
representation and dynamically weighted reconstruction of temporal features
through a three-level cascade structure (time pyramid pooling, adaptive feature
fusion, and temporal context enhancement). CBAM maximizes the entropy
distribution of feature channels and spatial dimensions through dual attention
mapping. Simultaneously, the parallel path driven by CLIP introduces a
contrastive language-visual pre-training paradigm. Cross-modal semantic
alignment and a multiscale instance selection mechanism provide high-order
semantic guidance for spatio-temporal features. This creates a complete
inference chain from the underlying spatio-temporal features to high-level
semantic concepts. The orthogonal complementarity of the two paths and the
information fusion mechanism jointly construct a comprehensive representation
and identification capability for anomalous events. Extensive experimental
results on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence benchmarks establish the effectiveness
of the DAMS framework.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）计算成本高，现有基于注意力的令牌修剪方法存在局限性（如位置偏差），需要更有效的方法。

Method: 提出TransPrune，结合TTV（衡量令牌表示的变化）和IGA（衡量指令对图像令牌的注意力）逐步修剪令牌。

Result: 在八个基准测试中，TransPrune性能接近原始LVLMs，同时将推理计算量减少一半以上。TTV单独使用也能达到类似效果。

Conclusion: TransPrune为令牌修剪提供了高效且无需训练的解决方案，TTV可作为独立标准替代注意力方法。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have advanced multimodal learning but
face high computational costs due to the large number of visual tokens,
motivating token pruning to improve inference efficiency. The key challenge
lies in identifying which tokens are truly important. Most existing approaches
rely on attention-based criteria to estimate token importance. However, they
inherently suffer from certain limitations, such as positional bias. In this
work, we explore a new perspective on token importance based on token
transitions in LVLMs. We observe that the transition of token representations
provides a meaningful signal of semantic information. Based on this insight, we
propose TransPrune, a training-free and efficient token pruning method.
Specifically, TransPrune progressively prunes tokens by assessing their
importance through a combination of Token Transition Variation (TTV)-which
measures changes in both the magnitude and direction of token
representations-and Instruction-Guided Attention (IGA), which measures how
strongly the instruction attends to image tokens via attention. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that TransPrune achieves comparable multimodal
performance to original LVLMs, such as LLaVA-v1.5 and LLaVA-Next, across eight
benchmarks, while reducing inference TFLOPs by more than half. Moreover, TTV
alone can serve as an effective criterion without relying on attention,
achieving performance comparable to attention-based methods. The code will be
made publicly available upon acceptance of the paper at

Abstract: Recovering a continuous colormap from a single 2D scalar field visualization
can be quite challenging, especially in the absence of a corresponding color
legend. In this paper, we propose a novel colormap recovery approach that
extracts the colormap from a color-encoded 2D scalar field visualization by
simultaneously predicting the colormap and underlying data using a
decoupling-and-reconstruction strategy. Our approach first separates the input
visualization into colormap and data using a decoupling module, then
reconstructs the visualization with a differentiable color-mapping module. To
guide this process, we design a reconstruction loss between the input and
reconstructed visualizations, which serves both as a constraint to ensure
strong correlation between colormap and data during training, and as a
self-supervised optimizer for fine-tuning the predicted colormap of unseen
visualizations during inferencing. To ensure smoothness and correct color
ordering in the extracted colormap, we introduce a compact colormap

We evaluate our method quantitatively and qualitatively on a synthetic dataset

Additionally, we demonstrate its utility in two prototype applications --
colormap adjustment and colormap transfer -- and explore its generalization to
visualizations with color legends and ones encoded using discrete color
palettes.

Abstract: Understanding and predicting player movement in multiplayer games is crucial
for achieving use cases such as player-mimicking bot navigation, preemptive bot
control, strategy recommendation, and real-time player behavior analytics.
However, the complex environments allow for a high degree of navigational
freedom, and the interactions and team-play between players require models that
make effective use of the available heterogeneous input data. This paper
presents a multimodal architecture for predicting future player locations on a
dynamic time horizon, using a U-Net-based approach for calculating endpoint
location probability heatmaps, conditioned using a multimodal feature encoder.
The application of a multi-head attention mechanism for different groups of
features allows for communication between agents. In doing so, the architecture
makes efficient use of the multimodal game state including image inputs,
numerical and categorical features, as well as dynamic game data. Consequently,
the presented technique lays the foundation for various downstream tasks that
rely on future player positions such as the creation of player-predictive bot
behavior or player anomaly detection.

Abstract: Accurate detection of defects such as hotspots and snail trails in
photovoltaic modules is essential for maintaining energy efficiency and system
reliablility. This work presents a supervised deep learning framework for
segmenting thermal infrared images of PV panels, using a dataset of 277 aerial
thermographic images captured by zenmuse XT infrared camera mounted on a DJI
Matrice 100 drone. The preprocessing pipeline includes image resizing, CLAHE
based contrast enhancement, denoising, and normalisation. A lightweight
semantic segmentation model based on SegFormer is developed, featuring a
customised Transformwer encoder and streamlined decoder, and fine-tuned on
annotated images with manually labeled defect regions. To evaluate performance,
we benchmark our model against U-Net, DeepLabV3, PSPNet, and Mask2Former using
consistent preprocessing and augmentation. Evaluation metrices includes
per-class Dice score, F1-score, Cohen's kappa, mean IoU, and pixel accuracy.
The SegFormer-based model outperforms baselines in accuracy and efficiency,
particularly for segmenting small and irregular defects. Its lightweight design

Conclusion: 该方法为部分校准相机提供了一种实用且高效的姿态估计解决方案。

Abstract: We present a derivation for estimating the roll and pitch orientation of a
partially calibrated camera mounted above a planar surface, using minimal scene
information. Specifically, we assume known intrinsic parameters and a fixed
height between the camera and the observed plane. By detecting a single
straight reference line at a known planar distance -- such as the edge between
a floor and a wall -- we estimate the roll and pitch angles via inverse
projection geometry. The method leverages geometric constraints and the camera
model, including lens distortion correction. This approach is suitable for
scenarios where full calibration is impractical and offers a lightweight
alternative for multi-camera systems operating in constrained environments.

Conclusion: 该方法为跨域图像合成提供了高效、鲁棒的解决方案，推动了未来研究和应用。

Abstract: Image composition has advanced significantly with large-scale pre-trained T2I
diffusion models. Despite progress in same-domain composition, cross-domain
composition remains under-explored. The main challenges are the stochastic
nature of diffusion models and the style gap between input images, leading to
failures and artifacts. Additionally, heavy reliance on text prompts limits
practical applications. This paper presents the first cross-domain image
composition method that does not require text prompts, allowing natural
stylization and seamless compositions. Our method is efficient and robust,
preserving the diffusion prior, as it involves minor steps for backward
inversion and forward denoising without training the diffuser. Our method also
uses a simple multilayer perceptron network to integrate CLIP features from
foreground and background, manipulating diffusion with a local cross-attention
strategy. It effectively preserves foreground content while enabling stable
stylization without a pre-stylization network. Finally, we create a benchmark
dataset with diverse contents and styles for fair evaluation, addressing the
lack of testing datasets for cross-domain image composition. Our method
outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in both qualitative and quantitative
evaluations, significantly improving the LPIPS score by 30.5% and the CSD
metric by 18.1%. We believe our method will advance future research and
applications. Code and benchmark at https://github.com/sherlhw/AIComposer.

Abstract: Weak-strong consistency learning strategies are widely employed in
semi-supervised medical image segmentation to train models by leveraging
limited labeled data and enforcing weak-to-strong consistency. However,
existing methods primarily focus on designing and combining various
perturbation schemes, overlooking the inherent potential and limitations within
the framework itself. In this paper, we first identify two critical
deficiencies: (1) separated training data streams, which lead to confirmation
bias dominated by the labeled stream; and (2) incomplete utilization of
supervisory information, which limits exploration of strong-to-weak
consistency. To tackle these challenges, we propose a style-aware blending and
prototype-based cross-contrast consistency learning framework. Specifically,
inspired by the empirical observation that the distribution mismatch between
labeled and unlabeled data can be characterized by statistical moments, we
design a style-guided distribution blending module to break the independent
training data streams. Meanwhile, considering the potential noise in strong
pseudo-labels, we introduce a prototype-based cross-contrast strategy to
encourage the model to learn informative supervisory signals from both
weak-to-strong and strong-to-weak predictions, while mitigating the adverse
effects of noise. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and
superiority of our framework across multiple medical segmentation benchmarks
under various semi-supervised settings.

a novel Multi-Masked Querying Network (MMQ-Net) to address these issues by
integrating multiple querying mechanisms into a unified framework.
Specifically, it uses modality queries to reconstruct missing data from

interference queries to separate relevant information from noise. Extensive
experiment results demonstrate the superior emotion recognition performance of
MMQ-Net compared to existing approaches, particularly under high levels of data

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了AVS中的模态差异问题，提升了分割性能。

Abstract: Audio-visual segmentation (AVS) aims to segment objects in videos based on
audio cues. Existing AVS methods are primarily designed to enhance interaction
efficiency but pay limited attention to modality representation discrepancies
and imbalances. To overcome this, we propose the implicit counterfactual
framework (ICF) to achieve unbiased cross-modal understanding. Due to the lack
of semantics, heterogeneous representations may lead to erroneous matches,
especially in complex scenes with ambiguous visual content or interference from
multiple audio sources. We introduce the multi-granularity implicit text (MIT)
involving video-, segment- and frame-level as the bridge to establish the
modality-shared space, reducing modality gaps and providing prior guidance.
Visual content carries more information and typically dominates, thereby
marginalizing audio features in the decision-making. To mitigate knowledge
preference, we propose the semantic counterfactual (SC) to learn orthogonal
representations in the latent space, generating diverse counterfactual samples,
thus avoiding biases introduced by complex functional designs and explicit
modifications of text structures or attributes. We further formulate the
collaborative distribution-aware contrastive learning (CDCL), incorporating
factual-counterfactual and inter-modality contrasts to align representations,
promoting cohesion and decoupling. Extensive experiments on three public
datasets validate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

Abstract: Computer vision seeks to infer a wide range of information about objects and
events. However, vision systems based on conventional imaging are limited to
extracting information only from the visible surfaces of scene objects. For
instance, a vision system can detect and identify a Coke can in the scene, but
it cannot determine whether the can is full or empty. In this paper, we aim to
expand the scope of computer vision to include the novel task of inferring the
hidden liquid levels of opaque containers by sensing the tiny vibrations on
their surfaces. Our method provides a first-of-a-kind way to inspect the fill
level of multiple sealed containers remotely, at once, without needing physical
manipulation and manual weighing. First, we propose a novel speckle-based
vibration sensing system for simultaneously capturing scene vibrations on a 2D
grid of points. We use our system to efficiently and remotely capture a dataset
of vibration responses for a variety of everyday liquid containers. Then, we
develop a transformer-based approach for analyzing the captured vibrations and
classifying the container type and its hidden liquid level at the time of
measurement. Our architecture is invariant to the vibration source, yielding
correct liquid level estimates for controlled and ambient scene sound sources.
Moreover, our model generalizes to unseen container instances within known
classes (e.g., training on five Coke cans of a six-pack, testing on a sixth)
and fluid levels. We demonstrate our method by recovering liquid levels from
various everyday containers.

Conclusion: KASportsFormer通过结合运动学解剖特征，显著提升了体育场景中3D姿态估计的准确性。

Abstract: Recent transformer based approaches have demonstrated impressive performance
in solving real-world 3D human pose estimation problems. Albeit these
approaches achieve fruitful results on benchmark datasets, they tend to fall
short of sports scenarios where human movements are more complicated than daily
life actions, as being hindered by motion blur, occlusions, and domain shifts.
Moreover, due to the fact that critical motions in a sports game often finish
in moments of time (e.g., shooting), the ability to focus on momentary actions
is becoming a crucial factor in sports analysis, where current methods appear
to struggle with instantaneous scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce KASportsFormer, a novel transformer based 3D pose estimation
framework for sports that incorporates a kinematic anatomy-informed feature
representation and integration module. In which the inherent kinematic motion
information is extracted with the Bone Extractor (BoneExt) and Limb Fuser
(LimbFus) modules and encoded in a multimodal manner. This improved the
capability of comprehending sports poses in short videos. We evaluate our
method through two representative sports scene datasets: SportsPose and
WorldPose. Experimental results show that our proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art results with MPJPE errors of 58.0mm and 34.3mm, respectively.

Abstract: Multimodal fusion has become a key enabler for UAV-based object detection, as
each modality provides complementary cues for robust feature extraction.
However, due to significant differences in resolution, field of view, and
sensing characteristics across modalities, accurate registration is a
prerequisite before fusion. Despite its importance, there is currently no
publicly available benchmark specifically designed for multimodal registration
in UAV-based aerial scenarios, which severely limits the development and
evaluation of advanced registration methods under real-world conditions. To
bridge this gap, we present ATR-UMMIM, the first benchmark dataset specifically
tailored for multimodal image registration in UAV-based applications. This
dataset includes 7,969 triplets of raw visible, infrared, and precisely
registered visible images captured covers diverse scenarios including flight
altitudes from 80m to 300m, camera angles from 0{\deg} to 75{\deg}, and
all-day, all-year temporal variations under rich weather and illumination
conditions. To ensure high registration quality, we design a semi-automated
annotation pipeline to introduce reliable pixel-level ground truth to each
triplet. In addition, each triplet is annotated with six imaging condition
attributes, enabling benchmarking of registration robustness under real-world
deployment settings. To further support downstream tasks, we provide
object-level annotations on all registered images, covering 11 object
categories with 77,753 visible and 78,409 infrared bounding boxes. We believe
ATR-UMMIM will serve as a foundational benchmark for advancing multimodal
registration, fusion, and perception in real-world UAV scenarios. The datatset

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have exhibited impressive
performance across various visual tasks. Subsequent investigations into
enhancing their visual reasoning abilities have significantly expanded their
performance envelope. However, a critical bottleneck in the advancement of
MLLMs toward deep visual reasoning is their heavy reliance on curated
image-text supervision. To solve this problem, we introduce a novel framework
termed ``Reasoning-Rendering-Visual-Feedback'' (RRVF), which enables MLLMs to
learn complex visual reasoning from only raw images. This framework builds on
the ``Asymmetry of Verification'' principle to train MLLMs, i.e., verifying the
rendered output against a source image is easier than generating it. We
demonstrate that this relative ease provides an ideal reward signal for
optimization via Reinforcement Learning (RL) training, reducing the reliance on
the image-text supervision. Guided by the above principle, RRVF implements a
closed-loop iterative process encompassing reasoning, rendering, and visual
feedback components, enabling the model to perform self-correction through
multi-turn interactions and tool invocation, while this pipeline can be
optimized by the GRPO algorithm in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments
on image-to-code generation for data charts and web interfaces show that RRVF
substantially outperforms existing open-source MLLMs and surpasses supervised
fine-tuning baselines. Our findings demonstrate that systems driven by purely
visual feedback present a viable path toward more robust and generalizable
reasoning models without requiring explicit supervision. Code will be available

Abstract: Remote sensing (RS) images from multiple modalities and platforms exhibit
diverse details due to differences in sensor characteristics and imaging
perspectives. Existing vision-language research in RS largely relies on
relatively homogeneous data sources. Moreover, they still remain limited to
conventional visual perception tasks such as classification or captioning. As a
result, these methods fail to serve as a unified and standalone framework
capable of effectively handling RS imagery from diverse sources in real-world
applications. To address these issues, we propose RingMo-Agent, a model
designed to handle multi-modal and multi-platform data that performs perception
and reasoning tasks based on user textual instructions. Compared with existing
models, RingMo-Agent 1) is supported by a large-scale vision-language dataset
named RS-VL3M, comprising over 3 million image-text pairs, spanning optical,
SAR, and infrared (IR) modalities collected from both satellite and UAV
platforms, covering perception and challenging reasoning tasks; 2) learns
modality adaptive representations by incorporating separated embedding layers
to construct isolated features for heterogeneous modalities and reduce
cross-modal interference; 3) unifies task modeling by introducing task-specific
tokens and employing a token-based high-dimensional hidden state decoding
mechanism designed for long-horizon spatial tasks. Extensive experiments on
various RS vision-language tasks demonstrate that RingMo-Agent not only proves
effective in both visual understanding and sophisticated analytical tasks, but
also exhibits strong generalizability across different platforms and sensing
modalities.

Abstract: Synthetic data has emerged as a promising alternative for training face
recognition (FR) models, offering advantages in scalability, privacy
compliance, and potential for bias mitigation. However, critical questions
remain on whether both high accuracy and fairness can be achieved with
synthetic data. In this work, we evaluate the impact of synthetic data on bias
and performance of FR systems. We generate balanced face dataset, FairFaceGen,
using two state of the art text-to-image generators, Flux.1-dev and Stable
Diffusion v3.5 (SD35), and combine them with several identity augmentation
methods, including Arc2Face and four IP-Adapters. By maintaining equal identity
count across synthetic and real datasets, we ensure fair comparisons when
evaluating FR performance on standard (LFW, AgeDB-30, etc.) and challenging
IJB-B/C benchmarks and FR bias on Racial Faces in-the-Wild (RFW) dataset. Our
results demonstrate that although synthetic data still lags behind the real
datasets in the generalization on IJB-B/C, demographically balanced synthetic
datasets, especially those generated with SD35, show potential for bias
mitigation. We also observe that the number and quality of intra-class
augmentations significantly affect FR accuracy and fairness. These findings
provide practical guidelines for constructing fairer FR systems using synthetic
data.

Abstract: Accurate forest height estimation is crucial for climate change monitoring
and carbon cycle assessment. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), particularly in
multi-channel configurations, has provided support for a long time in 3D forest
structure reconstruction through model-based techniques. More recently,
data-driven approaches using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) have
enabled new opportunities for forest parameter retrieval. This paper introduces
FGump, a forest height estimation framework by gradient boosting using
multi-channel SAR processing with LiDAR profiles as Ground Truth(GT). Unlike
typical ML and DL approaches that require large datasets and complex
architectures, FGump ensures a strong balance between accuracy and
computational efficiency, using a limited set of hand-designed features and
avoiding heavy preprocessing (e.g., calibration and/or quantization). Evaluated
under both classification and regression paradigms, the proposed framework
demonstrates that the regression formulation enables fine-grained, continuous
estimations and avoids quantization artifacts by resulting in more precise
measurements without rounding. Experimental results confirm that FGump
outperforms State-of-the-Art (SOTA) AI-based and classical methods, achieving
higher accuracy and significantly lower training and inference times, as
demonstrated in our results.

Method: 提出FantasyID数据集，模拟真实身份证件设计，包含多种样式、语言和真实人脸，并通过打印和拍摄生成真实样本，同时模拟数字伪造攻击。

Result: 现有伪造检测算法（如TruFor、MMFusion等）在FantasyID数据集上表现不佳，假阴性率接近50%。

Conclusion: FantasyID数据集复杂度高，适合作为伪造检测算法的评估基准。

Abstract: Advancements in image generation led to the availability of easy-to-use tools
for malicious actors to create forged images. These tools pose a serious threat
to the widespread Know Your Customer (KYC) applications, requiring robust
systems for detection of the forged Identity Documents (IDs). To facilitate the
development of the detection algorithms, in this paper, we propose a novel
publicly available (including commercial use) dataset, FantasyID, which mimics
real-world IDs but without tampering with legal documents and, compared to
previous public datasets, it does not contain generated faces or specimen
watermarks. FantasyID contains ID cards with diverse design styles, languages,
and faces of real people. To simulate a realistic KYC scenario, the cards from
FantasyID were printed and captured with three different devices, constituting
the bonafide class. We have emulated digital forgery/injection attacks that
could be performed by a malicious actor to tamper the IDs using the existing
generative tools. The current state-of-the-art forgery detection algorithms,
such as TruFor, MMFusion, UniFD, and FatFormer, are challenged by FantasyID
dataset. It especially evident, in the evaluation conditions close to
practical, with the operational threshold set on validation set so that false
positive rate is at 10%, leading to false negative rates close to 50% across
the board on the test set. The evaluation experiments demonstrate that
FantasyID dataset is complex enough to be used as an evaluation benchmark for
detection algorithms.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新型的Split Coordinate Attention (SCA)模块，通过改进注意力机制提升建筑足迹提取的精度，在多个数据集上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 建筑足迹提取在遥感图像分析中具有重要意义，但现有方法仍面临挑战。

Method: 引入SCA模块，通过双空间范围池化核和分通道编码策略，提升语义特征提取效率，并集成到2D CNN中形成SCANet。

Result: SCANet在WHU和Massachusetts数据集上取得最佳IoU，分别为91.61%和75.49%。

Conclusion: SCA模块有效提升了建筑足迹提取的性能，为相关应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Building footprint extraction holds immense significance in remote sensing
image analysis and has great value in urban planning, land use, environmental
protection and disaster assessment. Despite the progress made by conventional
and deep learning approaches in this field, they continue to encounter
significant challenges. This paper introduces a novel plug-and-play attention
module, Split Coordinate Attention (SCA), which ingeniously captures spatially
remote interactions by employing two spatial range of pooling kernels,
strategically encoding each channel along x and y planes, and separately
performs a series of split operations for each feature group, thus enabling
more efficient semantic feature extraction. By inserting into a 2D CNN to form
an effective SCANet, our SCANet outperforms recent SOTA methods on the public
Wuhan University (WHU) Building Dataset and Massachusetts Building Dataset in
terms of various metrics. Particularly SCANet achieves the best IoU, 91.61% and
75.49% for the two datasets. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 论文指出CLIP在少样本分类中的评估存在问题，提出了一种基于遗忘技术的真实归纳基准，并改进了少样本分类方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在标准少样本数据集上评估CLIP的性能，但未体现其真实归纳能力，因为数据集可能已被CLIP见过。

Method: 提出了一种使用遗忘技术的流程，生成真实归纳基准，并改进了少样本分类方法。

Result: 在新基准下，方法性能平均下降55%，但改进方法在5880次实验中表现最优。

Conclusion: 论文揭示了CLIP少样本分类评估的问题，提出了解决方案和新基准，并改进了方法。

Abstract: CLIP is a foundational model with transferable classification performance in
the few-shot setting. Several methods have shown improved performance of CLIP
using few-shot examples. However, so far, all these techniques have been
benchmarked using standard few-shot datasets. We argue that this mode of
evaluation does not provide a true indication of the inductive generalization
ability using few-shot examples. As most datasets have been seen by the CLIP
model, the resultant setting can be termed as partially transductive. To solve
this, we propose a pipeline that uses an unlearning technique to obtain true
inductive baselines. In this new inductive setting, the methods show a
significant drop in performance (-55% on average among 13 baselines with
multiple datasets). We validate the unlearning technique using oracle
baselines. An improved few-shot classification technique is proposed that
consistently obtains state-of-the-art performance over 13 other recent baseline
methods on a comprehensive analysis with 5880 experiments - varying the
datasets, differing number of few-shot examples, unlearning setting, and with
different seeds. Thus, we identify the issue with the evaluation of CLIP-based
few-shot classification, provide a solution using unlearning, propose new
benchmarks, and provide an improved method.

TL;DR: METEOR提出了一种多阶段剪枝框架，用于高效的多编码器视觉语言模型，显著减少冗余视觉标记。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单编码器架构在多模态任务中的泛化限制，以及多编码器融合方法的高计算成本问题。

Method: 采用渐进式剪枝策略，包括编码阶段的协作标记分配、融合阶段的跨编码器冗余减少和解码阶段的自适应标记剪枝。

Result: 在11个基准测试中表现优异，相比EAGLE减少了76%的视觉标记，性能仅下降0.3%。

Conclusion: METEOR首次实现了高效的多编码器视觉语言模型，通过多阶段剪枝策略显著提升了效率。

Abstract: Vision encoders serve as the cornerstone of multimodal understanding.
Single-encoder architectures like CLIP exhibit inherent constraints in
generalizing across diverse multimodal tasks, while recent multi-encoder fusion
methods introduce prohibitive computational overhead to achieve superior
performance using complementary visual representations from multiple vision
encoders. To address this, we propose a progressive pruning framework, namely
Multi-Encoder collaboraTivE tOken pRuning (METEOR), that eliminates redundant
visual tokens across the encoding, fusion, and decoding stages for
multi-encoder MLLMs. For multi-vision encoding, we discard redundant tokens
within each encoder via a rank guided collaborative token assignment strategy.
Subsequently, for multi-vision fusion, we combine the visual features from
different encoders while reducing cross-encoder redundancy with cooperative
pruning. Finally, we propose an adaptive token pruning method in the LLM
decoding stage to further discard irrelevant tokens based on the text prompts
with dynamically adjusting pruning ratios for specific task demands. To our
best knowledge, this is the first successful attempt that achieves an efficient
multi-encoder based vision language model with multi-stage pruning strategies.
Extensive experiments on 11 benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed approach. Compared with EAGLE, a typical multi-encoder MLLMs, METEOR
reduces 76% visual tokens with only 0.3% performance drop in average. The code
is available at https://github.com/YuchenLiu98/METEOR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于3D高斯椭球的SLAM方法效率较低，$S^3$LAM通过2D高斯面元提升场景表示效率和几何精度。

Method: 利用2D高斯面元作为基本单元，结合自适应表面渲染策略和直接推导的相机位姿雅可比矩阵，优化跟踪和建图。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上验证，$S^3$LAM性能达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: $S^3$LAM通过2D面元和高精度几何表示，显著提升了SLAM系统的效率和准确性。

Abstract: We propose $S^3$LAM, a novel RGB-D SLAM system that leverages 2D surfel
splatting to achieve highly accurate geometric representations for simultaneous
tracking and mapping. Unlike existing 3DGS-based SLAM approaches that rely on
3D Gaussian ellipsoids, we utilize 2D Gaussian surfels as primitives for more
efficient scene representation. By focusing on the surfaces of objects in the
scene, this design enables $S^3$LAM to reconstruct high-quality geometry,
benefiting both mapping and tracking. To address inherent SLAM challenges
including real-time optimization under limited viewpoints, we introduce a novel
adaptive surface rendering strategy that improves mapping accuracy while
maintaining computational efficiency. We further derive camera pose Jacobians
directly from 2D surfel splatting formulation, highlighting the importance of
our geometrically accurate representation that improves tracking convergence.
Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets validate that
$S^3$LAM achieves state-of-the-art performance. Code will be made publicly
available.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于对象中心表示的视频合成框架，结合扩散模型实现高质量、时序一致的视频生成与编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏生成能力或忽略对象级结构，无法满足高质量视频合成的需求。

Method: 通过学习姿态不变的对象中心槽，并结合预训练扩散模型，实现时序动态的捕捉。

Result: 在视频生成质量和时序一致性上优于现有方法，支持对象插入、删除等编辑操作。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了交互式视频生成能力，为内容创作和动态场景理解开辟了新方向。

Abstract: We present a novel framework for compositional video synthesis that leverages
temporally consistent object-centric representations, extending our previous
work, SlotAdapt, from images to video. While existing object-centric approaches
either lack generative capabilities entirely or treat video sequences
holistically, thus neglecting explicit object-level structure, our approach
explicitly captures temporal dynamics by learning pose invariant object-centric
slots and conditioning them on pretrained diffusion models. This design enables
high-quality, pixel-level video synthesis with superior temporal coherence, and
offers intuitive compositional editing capabilities such as object insertion,
deletion, or replacement, maintaining consistent object identities across
frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method sets new benchmarks
in video generation quality and temporal consistency, outperforming previous
object-centric generative methods. Although our segmentation performance
closely matches state-of-the-art methods, our approach uniquely integrates this
capability with robust generative performance, significantly advancing
interactive and controllable video generation and opening new possibilities for
advanced content creation, semantic editing, and dynamic scene understanding.

TL;DR: 论文提出UnionCut和UnionSeg方法，解决无监督对象发现中的前景背景区分和对象数量不确定性问题，提升现有方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无监督对象发现（UOD）面临前景背景区分和对象数量不确定性的挑战，现有方法依赖启发式前景先验和固定迭代次数，效果不稳定。

Method: 提出基于min-cut和集成方法的UnionCut前景先验，以及高效的UnionSeg蒸馏模型，用于准确识别前景并动态停止发现。

Result: 实验表明，结合UnionCut或UnionSeg后，现有UOD方法在单对象发现、显著性检测和自监督实例分割任务中性能显著提升。

Conclusion: UnionCut和UnionSeg为UOD提供了更鲁棒的前景先验和动态停止机制，显著提升了任务性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised object discovery (UOD) aims to detect and segment objects in 2D
images without handcrafted annotations. Recent progress in self-supervised
representation learning has led to some success in UOD algorithms. However, the
absence of ground truth provides existing UOD methods with two challenges: 1)
determining if a discovered region is foreground or background, and 2) knowing
how many objects remain undiscovered. To address these two problems, previous
solutions rely on foreground priors to distinguish if the discovered region is
foreground, and conduct one or fixed iterations of discovery. However, the
existing foreground priors are heuristic and not always robust, and a fixed
number of discoveries leads to under or over-segmentation, since the number of
objects in images varies. This paper introduces UnionCut, a robust and
well-grounded foreground prior based on min-cut and ensemble methods that
detects the union of foreground areas of an image, allowing UOD algorithms to
identify foreground objects and stop discovery once the majority of the
foreground union in the image is segmented. In addition, we propose UnionSeg, a
distilled transformer of UnionCut that outputs the foreground union more
efficiently and accurately. Our experiments show that by combining with
UnionCut or UnionSeg, previous state-of-the-art UOD methods witness an increase
in the performance of single object discovery, saliency detection and
self-supervised instance segmentation on various benchmarks. The code is

Motivation: 阿尔茨海默病影响全球5500万人，现有诊断方法无法同时满足准确性、泛化性、鲁棒性和可解释性需求，限制了临床可靠性。

Method: OmniBrain整合多种数据模态，采用跨注意力和模态丢弃技术，构建统一模型。

Result: 在ANMerge数据集上达到92.2%准确率，在ADNI数据集上达到70.4%准确率，优于单模态和现有多模态方法。

Conclusion: OmniBrain为阿尔茨海默病诊断提供了鲁棒、可解释且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease affects over 55 million people worldwide and is projected
to more than double by 2050, necessitating rapid, accurate, and scalable
diagnostics. However, existing approaches are limited because they cannot
achieve clinically acceptable accuracy, generalization across datasets,
robustness to missing modalities, and explainability all at the same time. This
inability to satisfy all these requirements simultaneously undermines their
reliability in clinical settings. We propose OmniBrain, a multimodal framework
that integrates brain MRI, radiomics, gene expression, and clinical data using
a unified model with cross-attention and modality dropout. OmniBrain achieves
$92.2 \pm 2.4\%$accuracy on the ANMerge dataset and generalizes to the MRI-only
ADNI dataset with $70.4 \pm 2.7\%$ accuracy, outperforming unimodal and prior
multimodal approaches. Explainability analyses highlight neuropathologically
relevant brain regions and genes, enhancing clinical trust. OmniBrain offers a
robust, interpretable, and practical solution for real-world Alzheimer's
diagnosis.

Conclusion: DriveAgent-R1为更安全、智能的自动驾驶系统提供了新路径。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are advancing autonomous driving, yet their
potential is constrained by myopic decision-making and passive perception,
limiting reliability in complex environments. We introduce DriveAgent-R1 to
tackle these challenges in long-horizon, high-level behavioral decision-making.
DriveAgent-R1 features two core innovations: a Hybrid-Thinking framework that
adaptively switches between efficient text-based and in-depth tool-based
reasoning, and an Active Perception mechanism with a vision toolkit to
proactively resolve uncertainties, thereby balancing decision-making efficiency
and reliability. The agent is trained using a novel, three-stage progressive
reinforcement learning strategy designed to master these hybrid capabilities.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DriveAgent-R1 achieves state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming even leading proprietary large multimodal models,
such as Claude Sonnet 4. Ablation studies validate our approach and confirm
that the agent's decisions are robustly grounded in actively perceived visual
evidence, paving a path toward safer and more intelligent autonomous systems.

Abstract: Endoscopic depth estimation is a critical technology for improving the safety
and precision of minimally invasive surgery. It has attracted considerable
attention from researchers in medical imaging, computer vision, and robotics.
Over the past decade, a large number of methods have been developed. Despite
the existence of several related surveys, a comprehensive overview focusing on
recent deep learning-based techniques is still limited. This paper endeavors to
bridge this gap by systematically reviewing the state-of-the-art literature.
Specifically, we provide a thorough survey of the field from three key
perspectives: data, methods, and applications, covering a range of methods
including both monocular and stereo approaches. We describe common performance
evaluation metrics and summarize publicly available datasets. Furthermore, this
review analyzes the specific challenges of endoscopic scenes and categorizes
representative techniques based on their supervision strategies and network
architectures. The application of endoscopic depth estimation in the important
area of robot-assisted surgery is also reviewed. Finally, we outline potential
directions for future research, such as domain adaptation, real-time
implementation, and enhanced model generalization, thereby providing a valuable
starting point for researchers to engage with and advance the field.

Motivation: 传统图像去雪方法依赖空间信息易产生伪影，视频方法对帧率要求高且对齐困难。事件相机因其低延迟和高动态范围特性，成为解决去雪问题的理想选择。

Method: 设计了一种基于注意力机制的模块，利用事件数据中雪花的条纹特征，识别遮挡并恢复背景强度。在DSEC-Snow数据集上验证了方法的有效性。

Result: 在图像重建PSNR上优于现有方法3 dB，后续任务（如深度估计和光流）性能提升20%。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了视觉系统在恶劣天气下的可靠性，为全天候应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Adverse weather conditions, particularly heavy snowfall, pose significant
challenges to both human drivers and autonomous vehicles. Traditional
image-based de-snowing methods often introduce hallucination artifacts as they
rely solely on spatial information, while video-based approaches require high
frame rates and suffer from alignment artifacts at lower frame rates. Camera
parameters, such as exposure time, also influence the appearance of snowflakes,
making the problem difficult to solve and heavily dependent on network
generalization. In this paper, we propose to address the challenge of desnowing
by using event cameras, which offer compressed visual information with
submillisecond latency, making them ideal for de-snowing images, even in the
presence of ego-motion. Our method leverages the fact that snowflake occlusions
appear with a very distinctive streak signature in the spatio-temporal
representation of event data. We design an attention-based module that focuses
on events along these streaks to determine when a background point was occluded
and use this information to recover its original intensity. We benchmark our
method on DSEC-Snow, a new dataset created using a green-screen technique that
overlays pre-recorded snowfall data onto the existing DSEC driving dataset,
resulting in precise ground truth and synchronized image and event streams. Our
approach outperforms state-of-the-art de-snowing methods by 3 dB in PSNR for
image reconstruction. Moreover, we show that off-the-shelf computer vision
algorithms can be applied to our reconstructions for tasks such as depth
estimation and optical flow, achieving a $20\%$ performance improvement over
other de-snowing methods. Our work represents a crucial step towards enhancing
the reliability and safety of vision systems in challenging winter conditions,
paving the way for more robust, all-weather-capable applications.

Motivation: 计算病理学中，不同扫描仪引入的变异性影响模型性能，需提升模型对扫描仪的泛化能力，以确保实际应用中的可靠性。

Method: 提出SCORPION数据集（480个组织样本，每个样本用5种扫描仪扫描）和SimCons框架（结合增强技术和一致性损失）。

Result: SimCons在保持任务性能的同时，显著提高了模型在不同扫描仪下的一致性。

Conclusion: SCORPION数据集和SimCons框架为研究社区提供了评估和改进模型一致性的关键资源，设定了新的可靠性测试标准。

Abstract: Ensuring reliable model performance across diverse domains is a critical
challenge in computational pathology. A particular source of variability in
Whole-Slide Images is introduced by differences in digital scanners, thus
calling for better scanner generalization. This is critical for the real-world
adoption of computational pathology, where the scanning devices may differ per
institution or hospital, and the model should not be dependent on
scanner-induced details, which can ultimately affect the patient's diagnosis
and treatment planning. However, past efforts have primarily focused on
standard domain generalization settings, evaluating on unseen scanners during
training, without directly evaluating consistency across scanners for the same
tissue. To overcome this limitation, we introduce SCORPION, a new dataset
explicitly designed to evaluate model reliability under scanner variability.
SCORPION includes 480 tissue samples, each scanned with 5 scanners, yielding
2,400 spatially aligned patches. This scanner-paired design allows for the
isolation of scanner-induced variability, enabling a rigorous evaluation of
model consistency while controlling for differences in tissue composition.
Furthermore, we propose SimCons, a flexible framework that combines
augmentation-based domain generalization techniques with a consistency loss to
explicitly address scanner generalization. We empirically show that SimCons
improves model consistency on varying scanners without compromising
task-specific performance. By releasing the SCORPION dataset and proposing
SimCons, we provide the research community with a crucial resource for
evaluating and improving model consistency across diverse scanners, setting a
new standard for reliability testing.

Conclusion: HAMLET-FFD作为一种外部插件，保留了CLIP的原始能力，同时显著提升了伪造检测的跨域泛化性能。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of face manipulation techniques poses a critical
challenge for face forgery detection: cross-domain generalization. Conventional
methods, which rely on simple classification objectives, often fail to learn
domain-invariant representations. We propose HAMLET-FFD, a cognitively inspired
Hierarchical Adaptive Multi-modal Learning framework that tackles this
challenge via bidirectional cross-modal reasoning. Building on contrastive
vision-language models such as CLIP, HAMLET-FFD introduces a knowledge
refinement loop that iteratively assesses authenticity by integrating visual
evidence with conceptual cues, emulating expert forensic analysis. A key
innovation is a bidirectional fusion mechanism in which textual authenticity
embeddings guide the aggregation of hierarchical visual features, while
modulated visual features refine text embeddings to generate image-adaptive
prompts. This closed-loop process progressively aligns visual observations with
semantic priors to enhance authenticity assessment. By design, HAMLET-FFD
freezes all pretrained parameters, serving as an external plugin that preserves
CLIP's original capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate its superior
generalization to unseen manipulations across multiple benchmarks, and visual
analyses reveal a division of labor among embeddings, with distinct
representations specializing in fine-grained artifact recognition.

Motivation: 低空无人机场景中的RIS研究不足，现有方法难以处理其独特特性（如多样视角和高密度对象）。

Method: 提出了SAARN模型，通过CDLE和ARFM模块分别对齐视觉特征与对象类别，并动态选择语义线索。

Result: 实验表明RIS-LAD对现有RIS算法构成挑战，SAARN能有效应对这些挑战。

Conclusion: RIS-LAD填补了低空无人机场景RIS研究的空白，SAARN为复杂场景提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Referring Image Segmentation (RIS), which aims to segment specific objects
based on natural language descriptions, plays an essential role in
vision-language understanding. Despite its progress in remote sensing
applications, RIS in Low-Altitude Drone (LAD) scenarios remains underexplored.
Existing datasets and methods are typically designed for high-altitude and
static-view imagery. They struggle to handle the unique characteristics of LAD
views, such as diverse viewpoints and high object density. To fill this gap, we
present RIS-LAD, the first fine-grained RIS benchmark tailored for LAD
scenarios. This dataset comprises 13,871 carefully annotated image-text-mask
triplets collected from realistic drone footage, with a focus on small,
cluttered, and multi-viewpoint scenes. It highlights new challenges absent in
previous benchmarks, such as category drift caused by tiny objects and object
drift under crowded same-class objects. To tackle these issues, we propose the
Semantic-Aware Adaptive Reasoning Network (SAARN). Rather than uniformly
injecting all linguistic features, SAARN decomposes and routes semantic
information to different stages of the network. Specifically, the
Category-Dominated Linguistic Enhancement (CDLE) aligns visual features with
object categories during early encoding, while the Adaptive Reasoning Fusion
Module (ARFM) dynamically selects semantic cues across scales to improve
reasoning in complex scenes. The experimental evaluation reveals that RIS-LAD
presents substantial challenges to state-of-the-art RIS algorithms, and also
demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed model in addressing these
challenges. The dataset and code will be publicly released soon at:

Motivation: 传统QBE方法需要实际查询文档样本，而ABDIR虽灵活但依赖视觉属性描述。研究旨在结合两者优势，利用生成式AI生成查询图像。

Method: 使用Leonardo.Ai作为文本到图像生成器，结合ABDIR属性描述生成查询图像，再通过传统QBE方法进行检索。

Conclusion: T2I-QBE是首次尝试将文本到图像生成应用于文档图像检索，为历史文档检索提供了新思路。

Abstract: Attribute-based document image retrieval (ABDIR) was recently proposed as an
alternative to query-by-example (QBE) searches, the dominant document image
retrieval (DIR) paradigm. One drawback of QBE searches is that they require
sample query documents on hand that may not be available. ABDIR aims to offer
users a flexible way to retrieve document images based on memorable visual
features of document contents, describing document images with combinations of
visual attributes determined via convolutional neural network (CNN)-based
binary classifiers. We present an exploratory study of the use of generative AI
to bridge the gap between QBE and ABDIR, focusing on historical documents as a
use case for their diversity and uniqueness in visual features. We hypothesize
that text-to-image (T2I) generation can be leveraged to create query document
images using text prompts based on ABDIR-like attributes. We propose T2I-QBE,
which uses Leonardo.Ai as the T2I generator with prompts that include a rough
description of the desired document type and a list of the desired ABDIR-style
attributes. This creates query images that are then used within the traditional
QBE paradigm, which compares CNN-extracted query features to those of the
document images in the dataset to retrieve the most relevant documents.
Experiments on the HisIR19 dataset of historical documents confirm our
hypothesis and suggest that T2I-QBE is a viable option for historical document
image retrieval. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first attempt at
utilizing T2I generation for DIR.

TL;DR: ARC-Hunyuan-Video是一个多模态模型，用于端到端处理视频中的视觉、音频和文本信号，支持多种视频理解任务，并在实际应用中显著提升了用户参与度和满意度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型多模态模型缺乏对短视频的深入理解能力，而短视频在移动互联网中占据主导地位，因此需要一种能够有效整合多模态信息的模型。

Method: 模型通过预训练、指令微调、冷启动、强化学习后训练和最终指令微调的综合训练方案，利用高质量数据训练了一个7B参数的紧凑模型。

Result: 模型在ShortVid-Bench基准测试中表现出色，支持零样本或少样本微调，实际部署中显著提升了用户参与度和满意度。

Conclusion: ARC-Hunyuan-Video在短视频理解任务中表现出强大的性能，并具有高效的实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Real-world user-generated short videos, especially those distributed on
platforms such as WeChat Channel and TikTok, dominate the mobile internet.
However, current large multimodal models lack essential temporally-structured,
detailed, and in-depth video comprehension capabilities, which are the
cornerstone of effective video search and recommendation, as well as emerging
video applications. Understanding real-world shorts is actually challenging due
to their complex visual elements, high information density in both visuals and
audio, and fast pacing that focuses on emotional expression and viewpoint
delivery. This requires advanced reasoning to effectively integrate multimodal
information, including visual, audio, and text. In this work, we introduce
ARC-Hunyuan-Video, a multimodal model that processes visual, audio, and textual
signals from raw video inputs end-to-end for structured comprehension. The
model is capable of multi-granularity timestamped video captioning and
summarization, open-ended video question answering, temporal video grounding,
and video reasoning. Leveraging high-quality data from an automated annotation
pipeline, our compact 7B-parameter model is trained through a comprehensive
regimen: pre-training, instruction fine-tuning, cold start, reinforcement
learning (RL) post-training, and final instruction fine-tuning. Quantitative
evaluations on our introduced benchmark ShortVid-Bench and qualitative
comparisons demonstrate its strong performance in real-world video
comprehension, and it supports zero-shot or fine-tuning with a few samples for
diverse downstream applications. The real-world production deployment of our
model has yielded tangible and measurable improvements in user engagement and
satisfaction, a success supported by its remarkable efficiency, with stress
tests indicating an inference time of just 10 seconds for a one-minute video on
H20 GPU.

Conclusion: 提出的方法避免了掩码和参考图像的缺点，提升了生成质量和身份细节保留。

Abstract: Audio-Driven Talking Face Generation aims at generating realistic videos of
talking faces, focusing on accurate audio-lip synchronization without
deteriorating any identity-related visual details. Recent state-of-the-art
methods are based on inpainting, meaning that the lower half of the input face
is masked, and the model fills the masked region by generating lips aligned
with the given audio. Hence, to preserve identity-related visual details from
the lower half, these approaches additionally require an unmasked identity
reference image randomly selected from the same video. However, this common
masking strategy suffers from (1) information loss in the input faces,
significantly affecting the networks' ability to preserve visual quality and
identity details, (2) variation between identity reference and input image
degrading reconstruction performance, and (3) the identity reference negatively
impacting the model, causing unintended copying of elements unaligned with the
audio. To address these issues, we propose a mask-free talking face generation
approach while maintaining the 2D-based face editing task. Instead of masking
the lower half, we transform the input images to have closed mouths, using a
two-step landmark-based approach trained in an unpaired manner. Subsequently,
we provide these edited but unmasked faces to a lip adaptation model alongside
the audio to generate appropriate lip movements. Thus, our approach needs
neither masked input images nor identity reference images. We conduct
experiments on the benchmark LRS2 and HDTF datasets and perform various
ablation studies to validate our contributions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未能充分利用时间信息，主要依赖相邻帧的局部时间交互，而忽略了全局序列信息。

Method: 提出GTAD网络，通过局部和全局时间特征聚合，结合去噪网络，实现更全面的3D场景理解。

Result: 在nuScenes和Occ3D-nuScenes基准测试中表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: GTAD方法能更连贯、全面地理解环境，为自动驾驶和机器人系统提供更准确的动态环境感知。

Abstract: Accurately perceiving dynamic environments is a fundamental task for
autonomous driving and robotic systems. Existing methods inadequately utilize
temporal information, relying mainly on local temporal interactions between
adjacent frames and failing to leverage global sequence information
effectively. To address this limitation, we investigate how to effectively
aggregate global temporal features from temporal sequences, aiming to achieve
occupancy representations that efficiently utilize global temporal information
from historical observations. For this purpose, we propose a global temporal
aggregation denoising network named GTAD, introducing a global temporal
information aggregation framework as a new paradigm for holistic 3D scene
understanding. Our method employs an in-model latent denoising network to
aggregate local temporal features from the current moment and global temporal
features from historical sequences. This approach enables the effective
perception of both fine-grained temporal information from adjacent frames and
global temporal patterns from historical observations. As a result, it provides
a more coherent and comprehensive understanding of the environment. Extensive
experiments on the nuScenes and Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark and ablation studies
demonstrate the superiority of our method.

Conclusion: 通过生成式数据增强和知识转移框架，有效解决了航拍图像车辆检测中的域偏移问题，并贡献了两个新的标注数据集。

Abstract: Detecting vehicles in aerial imagery is a critical task with applications in
traffic monitoring, urban planning, and defense intelligence. Deep learning
methods have provided state-of-the-art (SOTA) results for this application.
However, a significant challenge arises when models trained on data from one
geographic region fail to generalize effectively to other areas. Variability in
factors such as environmental conditions, urban layouts, road networks, vehicle
types, and image acquisition parameters (e.g., resolution, lighting, and angle)
leads to domain shifts that degrade model performance. This paper proposes a
novel method that uses generative AI to synthesize high-quality aerial images
and their labels, improving detector training through data augmentation. Our
key contribution is the development of a multi-stage, multi-modal knowledge
transfer framework utilizing fine-tuned latent diffusion models (LDMs) to
mitigate the distribution gap between the source and target environments.
Extensive experiments across diverse aerial imagery domains show consistent
performance improvements in AP50 over supervised learning on source domain
data, weakly supervised adaptation methods, unsupervised domain adaptation
methods, and open-set object detectors by 4-23%, 6-10%, 7-40%, and more than
50%, respectively. Furthermore, we introduce two newly annotated aerial
datasets from New Zealand and Utah to support further research in this field.

TL;DR: LargeMvC-Net是一种新型深度网络架构，通过分解锚点聚类过程为三个模块，提升了大规模多视图聚类的效果和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有锚点聚类方法在启发式或任务无关的方式下设计，忽略了核心优化需求，导致效果受限。

Method: 将锚点聚类优化问题分解为三个模块（RepresentModule、NoiseModule、AnchorModule），并通过无监督重建损失对齐视图。

Result: 在多个大规模多视图基准测试中，LargeMvC-Net在效果和可扩展性上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LargeMvC-Net通过结构清晰和可追踪的优化设计，显著提升了锚点多视图聚类的性能。

Abstract: Deep anchor-based multi-view clustering methods enhance the scalability of
neural networks by utilizing representative anchors to reduce the computational
complexity of large-scale clustering. Despite their scalability advantages,
existing approaches often incorporate anchor structures in a heuristic or
task-agnostic manner, either through post-hoc graph construction or as
auxiliary components for message passing. Such designs overlook the core
structural demands of anchor-based clustering, neglecting key optimization
principles. To bridge this gap, we revisit the underlying optimization problem
of large-scale anchor-based multi-view clustering and unfold its iterative
solution into a novel deep network architecture, termed LargeMvC-Net. The
proposed model decomposes the anchor-based clustering process into three
modules: RepresentModule, NoiseModule, and AnchorModule, corresponding to
representation learning, noise suppression, and anchor indicator estimation.
Each module is derived by unfolding a step of the original optimization
procedure into a dedicated network component, providing structural clarity and
optimization traceability. In addition, an unsupervised reconstruction loss
aligns each view with the anchor-induced latent space, encouraging consistent
clustering structures across views. Extensive experiments on several
large-scale multi-view benchmarks show that LargeMvC-Net consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both effectiveness and
scalability.

Conclusion: JWB-DH-V1为全身可动画化虚拟角色的多模态生成提供了重要资源和评估工具，推动了该领域的研究。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based video generation have enabled
photo-realistic short clips, but current methods still struggle to achieve
multi-modal consistency when jointly generating whole-body motion and natural
speech. Current approaches lack comprehensive evaluation frameworks that assess
both visual and audio quality, and there are insufficient benchmarks for
region-specific performance analysis. To address these gaps, we introduce the
Joint Whole-Body Talking Avatar and Speech Generation Version I(JWB-DH-V1),
comprising a large-scale multi-modal dataset with 10,000 unique identities
across 2 million video samples, and an evaluation protocol for assessing joint
audio-video generation of whole-body animatable avatars. Our evaluation of SOTA
models reveals consistent performance disparities between face/hand-centric and
whole-body performance, which incidates essential areas for future research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“安全张量”的方法，通过可训练的输入向量将文本安全机制扩展到视觉模态，以增强大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）对有害图像输入的防御能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于文本的大型语言模型（LLM）安全机制无法直接应用于视觉模态，导致LVLM容易受到有害图像输入的攻击。

Method: 引入安全张量，通过文本或视觉模态在推理时应用可训练的输入向量，利用包含恶意图像-文本对、对比良性对和一般良性样本的数据集进行优化。

Result: 实验表明，安全张量显著提升了LVLM拒绝有害视觉输入的能力，同时保持对良性任务的性能。

Conclusion: 安全张量成功将文本安全机制扩展到视觉模态，激活语言模块的“安全层”，从而有效防御有害视觉输入。

Abstract: Large visual-language models (LVLMs) integrate aligned large language models
(LLMs) with visual modules to process multimodal inputs. However, the safety
mechanisms developed for text-based LLMs do not naturally extend to visual
modalities, leaving LVLMs vulnerable to harmful image inputs. To address this
cross-modal safety gap, we introduce security tensors - trainable input vectors
applied during inference through either the textual or visual modality. These
tensors transfer textual safety alignment to visual processing without
modifying the model's parameters. They are optimized using a curated dataset
containing (i) malicious image-text pairs requiring rejection, (ii) contrastive
benign pairs with text structurally similar to malicious queries, with the
purpose of being contrastive examples to guide visual reliance, and (iii)
general benign samples preserving model functionality. Experimental results
demonstrate that both textual and visual security tensors significantly enhance
LVLMs' ability to reject diverse harmful visual inputs while maintaining
near-identical performance on benign tasks. Further internal analysis towards
hidden-layer representations reveals that security tensors successfully
activate the language module's textual "safety layers" in visual inputs,
thereby effectively extending text-based safety to the visual modality.

Motivation: CNN在对抗攻击下易受干扰，现有对抗训练方法在模型准确性和鲁棒性之间存在差距。

Method: 通过对抗训练生成多个教师模型，利用多教师知识蒸馏和自适应学习策略指导学生模型学习。

Result: 在MNIST-Digits和Fashion-MNIST数据集上验证了方法的有效性，提升了CNN的对抗鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 多教师对抗蒸馏和自适应学习策略能有效增强CNN对抗攻击的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) excel in computer vision but are
susceptible to adversarial attacks, crafted perturbations designed to mislead
predictions. Despite advances in adversarial training, a gap persists between
model accuracy and robustness. To mitigate this issue, in this paper, we
present a multi-teacher adversarial robustness distillation using an adaptive
learning strategy. Specifically, our proposed method first trained multiple
clones of a baseline CNN model using an adversarial training strategy on a pool
of perturbed data acquired through different adversarial attacks. Once trained,
these adversarially trained models are used as teacher models to supervise the
learning of a student model on clean data using multi-teacher knowledge
distillation. To ensure an effective robustness distillation, we design an
adaptive learning strategy that controls the knowledge contribution of each
model by assigning weights as per their prediction precision. Distilling
knowledge from adversarially pre-trained teacher models not only enhances the
learning capabilities of the student model but also empowers it with the
capacity to withstand different adversarial attacks, despite having no exposure
to adversarial data. To verify our claims, we extensively evaluated our
proposed method on MNIST-Digits and Fashion-MNIST datasets across diverse
experimental settings. The obtained results exhibit the efficacy of our
multi-teacher adversarial distillation and adaptive learning strategy,
enhancing CNNs' adversarial robustness against various adversarial attacks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有面部情绪识别系统局限于固定类别或维度，缺乏对情绪丰富性和细微差异的捕捉，自然语言描述提供了更灵活的表达方式。

Method: 构建EmoCap100K数据集，提出EmoCapCLIP框架，采用全局-局部对比学习结合跨模态引导的正样本挖掘模块。

Result: 在20多个基准测试中表现优异，验证了从大规模语义丰富描述中学习情绪表征的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过自然语言监督学习情绪表征具有潜力，EmoCapCLIP为相关研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Current facial emotion recognition systems are predominately trained to
predict a fixed set of predefined categories or abstract dimensional values.
This constrained form of supervision hinders generalization and applicability,
as it reduces the rich and nuanced spectrum of emotions into oversimplified
labels or scales. In contrast, natural language provides a more flexible,
expressive, and interpretable way to represent emotions, offering a much
broader source of supervision. Yet, leveraging semantically rich natural
language captions as supervisory signals for facial emotion representation
learning remains relatively underexplored, primarily due to two key challenges:
1) the lack of large-scale caption datasets with rich emotional semantics, and
2) the absence of effective frameworks tailored to harness such rich
supervision. To this end, we introduce EmoCap100K, a large-scale facial emotion
caption dataset comprising over 100,000 samples, featuring rich and structured
semantic descriptions that capture both global affective states and
fine-grained local facial behaviors. Building upon this dataset, we further
propose EmoCapCLIP, which incorporates a joint global-local contrastive
learning framework enhanced by a cross-modal guided positive mining module.
This design facilitates the comprehensive exploitation of multi-level caption
information while accommodating semantic similarities between closely related
expressions. Extensive evaluations on over 20 benchmarks covering five tasks
demonstrate the superior performance of our method, highlighting the promise of
learning facial emotion representations from large-scale semantically rich
captions. The code and data will be available at

Conclusion: 为自动化康复评估研究奠定基础，推动可靠、可访问和个性化康复解决方案的发展。

Abstract: Automated assessment of human motion plays a vital role in rehabilitation,
enabling objective evaluation of patient performance and progress. Unlike
general human activity recognition, rehabilitation motion assessment focuses on
analyzing the quality of movement within the same action class, requiring the
detection of subtle deviations from ideal motion. Recent advances in deep
learning and video-based skeleton extraction have opened new possibilities for
accessible, scalable motion assessment using affordable devices such as
smartphones or webcams. However, the field lacks standardized benchmarks,
consistent evaluation protocols, and reproducible methodologies, limiting
progress and comparability across studies. In this work, we address these gaps
by (i) aggregating existing rehabilitation datasets into a unified archive
called Rehab-Pile, (ii) proposing a general benchmarking framework for
evaluating deep learning methods in this domain, and (iii) conducting extensive
benchmarking of multiple architectures across classification and regression
tasks. All datasets and implementations are released to the community to
support transparency and reproducibility. This paper aims to establish a solid
foundation for future research in automated rehabilitation assessment and
foster the development of reliable, accessible, and personalized rehabilitation
solutions. The datasets, source-code and results of this article are all

Result: 微调后的开源模型（如FluxKontext）在多个基准测试中表现优异，显著缩小与专有模型的差距。

Conclusion: GPT-IMAGE-EDIT-1.5M的发布有望促进指令引导图像编辑领域的开放研究。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large multimodal models like GPT-4o have set a new
standard for high-fidelity, instruction-guided image editing. However, the
proprietary nature of these models and their training data creates a
significant barrier for open-source research. To bridge this gap, we introduce
GPT-IMAGE-EDIT-1.5M, a publicly available, large-scale image-editing corpus
containing more than 1.5 million high-quality triplets (instruction, source
image, edited image). We systematically construct this dataset by leveraging
the versatile capabilities of GPT-4o to unify and refine three popular
image-editing datasets: OmniEdit, HQ-Edit, and UltraEdit. Specifically, our
methodology involves 1) regenerating output images to enhance visual quality
and instruction alignment, and 2) selectively rewriting prompts to improve
semantic clarity. To validate the efficacy of our dataset, we fine-tune
advanced open-source models on GPT-IMAGE-EDIT-1.5M. The empirical results are
exciting, e.g., the fine-tuned FluxKontext achieves highly competitive
performance across a comprehensive suite of benchmarks, including 7.24 on
GEdit-EN, 3.80 on ImgEdit-Full, and 8.78 on Complex-Edit, showing stronger
instruction following and higher perceptual quality while maintaining identity.
These scores markedly exceed all previously published open-source methods and
substantially narrow the gap to leading proprietary models. We hope the full
release of GPT-IMAGE-EDIT-1.5M can help to catalyze further open research in
instruction-guided image editing.

Result: 提供了对4D空间智能重建的全面分析，并指出了每层的挑战和未来研究方向。

Conclusion: 通过分层框架推动4D空间智能的发展，并维护了一个持续更新的项目页面。

Abstract: Reconstructing 4D spatial intelligence from visual observations has long been
a central yet challenging task in computer vision, with broad real-world
applications. These range from entertainment domains like movies, where the
focus is often on reconstructing fundamental visual elements, to embodied AI,
which emphasizes interaction modeling and physical realism. Fueled by rapid
advances in 3D representations and deep learning architectures, the field has
evolved quickly, outpacing the scope of previous surveys. Additionally,
existing surveys rarely offer a comprehensive analysis of the hierarchical
structure of 4D scene reconstruction. To address this gap, we present a new
perspective that organizes existing methods into five progressive levels of 4D
spatial intelligence: (1) Level 1 -- reconstruction of low-level 3D attributes
(e.g., depth, pose, and point maps); (2) Level 2 -- reconstruction of 3D scene
components (e.g., objects, humans, structures); (3) Level 3 -- reconstruction
of 4D dynamic scenes; (4) Level 4 -- modeling of interactions among scene
components; and (5) Level 5 -- incorporation of physical laws and constraints.
We conclude the survey by discussing the key challenges at each level and
highlighting promising directions for advancing toward even richer levels of 4D
spatial intelligence. To track ongoing developments, we maintain an up-to-date

Motivation: 轮班工人占工业化社会劳动力的15-20%，但在传统交通调查和规划中代表性不足，导致对其移动需求的理解存在偏差。

Method: 采用基于Transformer的模型，结合周期性时间嵌入和过渡聚焦损失函数，从碎片化GPS轨迹数据生成完整且行为有效的活动模式。

Conclusion: 该方法为交通规划者提供了强大的数据增强工具，有助于更全面、精确地理解城市人口的24/7移动需求。

Abstract: This paper addresses a critical gap in urban mobility modeling by focusing on
shift workers, a population segment comprising 15-20% of the workforce in
industrialized societies yet systematically underrepresented in traditional
transportation surveys and planning. This underrepresentation is revealed in
this study by a comparative analysis of GPS and survey data, highlighting stark
differences between the bimodal temporal patterns of shift workers and the
conventional 9-to-5 schedules recorded in surveys. To address this bias, we
introduce a novel transformer-based approach that leverages fragmented GPS
trajectory data to generate complete, behaviorally valid activity patterns for
individuals working non-standard hours. Our method employs periodaware temporal
embeddings and a transition-focused loss function specifically designed to
capture the unique activity rhythms of shift workers and mitigate the inherent
biases in conventional transportation datasets. Evaluation shows that the
generated data achieves remarkable distributional alignment with GPS data from
Los Angeles County (Average JSD < 0.02 for all evaluation metrics). By
transforming incomplete GPS traces into complete, representative activity
patterns, our approach provides transportation planners with a powerful data
augmentation tool to fill critical gaps in understanding the 24/7 mobility
needs of urban populations, enabling precise and inclusive transportation
planning.

Abstract: Accurate spatiotemporal traffic forecasting is vital for intelligent resource
management in 5G and beyond. However, conventional AI approaches often fail to
capture the intricate spatial and temporal patterns that exist, due to e.g.,
the mobility of users. We introduce a lightweight, dual-path Spatiotemporal
Network that leverages a Scalar LSTM (sLSTM) for efficient temporal modeling
and a three-layer Conv3D module for spatial feature extraction. A fusion layer
integrates both streams into a cohesive representation, enabling robust
forecasting. Our design improves gradient stability and convergence speed while
reducing prediction error. Evaluations on real-world datasets show superior
forecast performance over ConvLSTM baselines and strong generalization to
unseen regions, making it well-suited for large-scale, next-generation network
deployments. Experimental evaluation shows a 23% MAE reduction over ConvLSTM,
with a 30% improvement in model generalization.

TL;DR: 提出了一种完全基于小波域的光谱学习框架，通过在小波系数上直接应用可学习的非线性变换，实现了高效的模型设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经网络层存在计算复杂性和参数过多的问题，需要一种更高效、紧凑且可解释的替代方案。

Method: 采用小波域操作，包括软阈值和增益相位调制，并引入可微分的小波基选择机制，支持多种小波族（如Haar、Daubechies等）。

Result: 在3D去噪和GLUE基准测试（如SST-2情感分类）中，模型准确率达89.3%，接近4层Transformer基线（90.1%），但参数减少72%，峰值内存降低58%。

Conclusion: 光谱学习框架为视觉和语言任务提供了一种高效、紧凑且可解释的替代方案，避免了过度参数化的架构。

Abstract: We introduce a fully spectral learning framework that eliminates traditional
neural layers by operating entirely in the wavelet domain. The model applies
learnable nonlinear transformations, including soft-thresholding and gain-phase
modulation, directly to wavelet coefficients. It also includes a differentiable
wavelet basis selection mechanism, enabling adaptive processing using families
such as Haar, Daubechies, and Biorthogonal wavelets.
  Implemented in PyTorch with full 3D support, the model maintains a spectral
pipeline without spatial convolutions or attention. On synthetic 3D denoising
and natural language tasks from the GLUE benchmark, including SST-2 sentiment
classification, the model achieves 89.3 percent accuracy, close to a 4-layer
Transformer baseline (90.1 percent), while using 72 percent fewer parameters
and 58 percent less peak memory. Faster early convergence is observed due to
spectral sparsity priors.
  In contrast to the quadratic complexity of self-attention and large matrix
multiplications in Transformers, our approach uses linear-time wavelet
transforms and pointwise nonlinearities, significantly reducing inference cost.
This yields a compact, interpretable, and efficient alternative to neural
models. Our results support the viability of principled spectral learning in
both vision and language tasks, offering new directions for model design
without overparameterized architectures.

Abstract: Influenza A is responsible for 290,000 to 650,000 respiratory deaths a year,
though this estimate is an improvement from years past due to improvements in
sanitation, healthcare practices, and vaccination programs. In this study, we
perform a comparative analysis of traditional and deep learning models to
predict Influenza A outbreaks. Using historical data from January 2009 to
December 2023, we compared the performance of traditional ARIMA and Exponential
Smoothing(ETS) models with six distinct deep learning architectures: Simple
RNN, LSTM, GRU, BiLSTM, BiGRU, and Transformer. The results reveal a clear
superiority of all the deep learning models, especially the state-of-the-art
Transformer with respective average testing MSE and MAE of 0.0433 \pm 0.0020
and 0.1126 \pm 0.0016 for capturing the temporal complexities associated with
Influenza A data, outperforming well known traditional baseline ARIMA and ETS
models. These findings of this study provide evidence that state-of-the-art
deep learning architectures can enhance predictive modeling for infectious
diseases and indicate a more general trend toward using deep learning methods
to enhance public health forecasting and intervention planning strategies.
Future work should focus on how these models can be incorporated into real-time
forecasting and preparedness systems at an epidemic level, and integrated into
existing surveillance systems.

Abstract: Accurate link-level bicycle volume estimation is essential for informed urban
and transport planning but it is challenged by extremely sparse count data in
urban bicycling networks worldwide. We propose BikeVAE-GNN, a novel dual-task
framework augmenting a Hybrid Graph Neural Network (GNN) with Variational
Autoencoder (VAE) to estimate Average Daily Bicycle (ADB) counts, addressing
sparse bicycle networks. The Hybrid-GNN combines Graph Convolutional Networks
(GCN), Graph Attention Networks (GAT), and GraphSAGE to effectively model
intricate spatial relationships in sparse networks while VAE generates
synthetic nodes and edges to enrich the graph structure and enhance the
estimation performance. BikeVAE-GNN simultaneously performs - regression for
bicycling volume estimation and classification for bicycling traffic level
categorization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of BikeVAE-GNN using
OpenStreetMap data and publicly available bicycle count data within the City of
Melbourne - where only 141 of 15,933 road segments have labeled counts
(resulting in 99% count data sparsity). Our experiments show that BikeVAE-GNN
outperforms machine learning and baseline GNN models, achieving a mean absolute
error (MAE) of 30.82 bicycles per day, accuracy of 99% and F1-score of 0.99.
Ablation studies further validate the effective role of Hybrid-GNN and VAE
components. Our research advances bicycling volume estimation in sparse
networks using novel and state-of-the-art approaches, providing insights for
sustainable bicycling infrastructures.

Abstract: Subgraph matching plays an important role in electronic design automation
(EDA) and circuit verification. Traditional rule-based methods have limitations
in generalizing to arbitrary target circuits. Furthermore, node-to-node
matching approaches tend to be computationally inefficient, particularly for
large-scale circuits. Deep learning methods have emerged as a potential
solution to address these challenges, but existing models fail to efficiently
capture global subgraph embeddings or rely on inefficient matching matrices,
which limits their effectiveness for large circuits. In this paper, we propose
an efficient graph matching approach that utilizes Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
to predict regions of high probability for containing the target circuit.
Specifically, we construct various negative samples to enable GNNs to
accurately learn the presence of target circuits and develop an approach to
directly extracting subgraph embeddings from the entire circuit, which captures
global subgraph information and addresses the inefficiency of applying GNNs to
all candidate subgraphs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of time efficiency and
target region prediction, offering a scalable and effective solution for
subgraph matching in large-scale circuits.

Result: 在对抗性定价下，缺乏发电能力的产消者群体遭受财务损失；随着市场规模扩大，交易稳定性和公平性通过智能体合作得到改善。

Conclusion: MADDPG框架有效协调能源交易，但价格操纵策略对部分产消者不利，市场规模的扩大有助于提升公平性。

Abstract: This paper introduces a model for coordinating prosumers with heterogeneous
distributed energy resources (DERs), participating in the local energy market
(LEM) that interacts with the market-clearing entity. The proposed LEM scheme
utilizes a data-driven, model-free reinforcement learning approach based on the
multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) framework, enabling
prosumers to make real-time decisions on whether to buy, sell, or refrain from
any action while facilitating efficient coordination for optimal energy trading
in a dynamic market. In addition, we investigate a price manipulation strategy
using a variational auto encoder-generative adversarial network (VAE-GAN)
model, which allows utilities to adjust price signals in a way that induces
financial losses for the prosumers. Our results show that under adversarial
pricing, heterogeneous prosumer groups, particularly those lacking generation
capabilities, incur financial losses. The same outcome holds across LEMs of
different sizes. As the market size increases, trading stabilizes and fairness
improves through emergent cooperation among agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结构健康监测（SHM）的训练数据昂贵且难以获取，尤其是标记数据。传统机器学习方法难以在不同结构间泛化，因此需要利用迁移学习（TL）解决分布差异问题。

Method: 利用物理知识选择特征，使用模态保证准则（MAC）量化模态相似性，并验证其与监督度量的一致性，以选择条件分布不变的特征。

Result: MAC被证明与衡量联合分布相似性的监督度量高度一致，可作为选择跨域一致特征的标准。数值和实验案例验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: MAC是一种有效的特征选择方法，能够提升迁移学习在SHM中的应用效果。

Abstract: Data used for training structural health monitoring (SHM) systems are
expensive and often impractical to obtain, particularly labelled data.
Population-based SHM presents a potential solution to this issue by considering
the available data across a population of structures. However, differences
between structures will mean the training and testing distributions will
differ; thus, conventional machine learning methods cannot be expected to
generalise between structures. To address this issue, transfer learning (TL),
can be used to leverage information across related domains. An important
consideration is that the lack of labels in the target domain limits data-based
metrics to quantifying the discrepancy between the marginal distributions.
Thus, a prerequisite for the application of typical unsupervised TL methods is
to identify suitable source structures (domains), and a set of features, for
which the conditional distributions are related to the target structure.
Generally, the selection of domains and features is reliant on domain
expertise; however, for complex mechanisms, such as the influence of damage on
the dynamic response of a structure, this task is not trivial. In this paper,
knowledge of physics is leveraged to select more similar features, the modal
assurance criterion (MAC) is used to quantify the correspondence between the
modes of healthy structures. The MAC is shown to have high correspondence with
a supervised metric that measures joint-distribution similarity, which is the
primary indicator of whether a classifier will generalise between domains. The
MAC is proposed as a measure for selecting a set of features that behave
consistently across domains when subjected to damage, i.e. features with
invariance in the conditional distributions. This approach is demonstrated on
numerical and experimental case studies to verify its effectiveness in various
applications.

Abstract: With manual searching processes, the rate at which scientists and astronomers
discover exoplanets is slow because of inefficiencies that require an extensive
time of laborious inspections. In fact, as of now there have been about only
5,000 confirmed exoplanets since the late 1900s. Recently, machine learning
(ML) has proven to be extremely valuable and efficient in various fields,
capable of processing massive amounts of data in addition to increasing its
accuracy by learning. Though ML models for discovering exoplanets owned by
large corporations (e.g. NASA) exist already, they largely depend on complex
algorithms and supercomputers. In an effort to reduce such complexities, in
this paper, we report the results and potential benefits of various, well-known
ML models in the discovery and validation of extrasolar planets. The ML models
that are examined in this study include logistic regression, k-nearest
neighbors, and random forest. The dataset on which the models train and predict
is acquired from NASA's Kepler space telescope. The initial results show
promising scores for each model. However, potential biases and dataset
imbalances necessitate the use of data augmentation techniques to further
ensure fairer predictions and improved generalization. This study concludes
that, in the context of searching for exoplanets, data augmentation techniques
significantly improve the recall and precision, while the accuracy varies for
each model.

Conclusion: PINN是一种强大的工具，能够结合先验知识高效求解微分方程，适用于复杂问题。

Abstract: Mathematical models in neural networks are powerful tools for solving complex
differential equations and optimizing their parameters; that is, solving the
forward and inverse problems, respectively. A forward problem predicts the
output of a network for a given input by optimizing weights and biases. An
inverse problem finds equation parameters or coefficients that effectively
model the data. A Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) can solve both
problems. PINNs inject prior analytical information about the data into the
cost function to improve model performance outside the training set boundaries.
This also allows PINNs to efficiently solve problems with sparse data without
overfitting by extrapolating the model to fit larger trends in the data. The
prior information we implement is in the form of differential equations.
Residuals are the differences between the left-hand and right-hand sides of
corresponding differential equations; PINNs minimize these residuals to
effectively solve the differential equation and take advantage of prior
knowledge. In this way, the solution and parameters are embedded into the loss
function and optimized, allowing both the weights of the neural network and the
model parameters to be found simultaneously, solving both the forward and
inverse problems in the process. In this paper, we will create PINNs with
residuals of varying complexity, beginning with linear and quadratic models and
then expanding to fit models for the heat equation and other complex
differential equations. We will mainly use Python as the computing language,
using the PyTorch library to aid us in our research.

Abstract: We consider controllable DNA sequence design, where sequences are generated
by conditioning on specific biological properties. While language models (LMs)
such as GPT and BERT have achieved remarkable success in natural language
generation, their application to DNA sequence generation remains largely
underexplored. In this work, we introduce ATGC-Gen, an Automated Transformer
Generator for Controllable Generation, which leverages cross-modal encoding to
integrate diverse biological signals. ATGC-Gen is instantiated with both
decoder-only and encoder-only transformer architectures, allowing flexible
training and generation under either autoregressive or masked recovery
objectives. We evaluate ATGC-Gen on representative tasks including promoter and
enhancer sequence design, and further introduce a new dataset based on ChIP-Seq
experiments for modeling protein binding specificity. Our experiments
demonstrate that ATGC-Gen can generate fluent, diverse, and biologically
relevant sequences aligned with the desired properties. Compared to prior
methods, our model achieves notable improvements in controllability and
functional relevance, highlighting the potential of language models in
advancing programmable genomic design. The source code is released at

Abstract: Deep learning neural networks architectures such Multi Layer Perceptrons
(MLP) and Convolutional blocks still play a crucial role in nowadays research
advancements. From a topological point of view, these architecture may be
represented as graphs in which we learn the functions related to the nodes
while fixed edges convey the information from the input to the output. A recent
work introduced a new architecture called Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KAN) that
reports how putting learnable activation functions on the edges of the neural
network leads to better performances in multiple scenarios. Multiple studies
are focusing on optimizing the KAN architecture by adding important features
such as dropout regularization, Autoencoders (AE), model benchmarking and last,
but not least, the KAN Convolutional Network (KCN) that introduced matrix
convolution with KANs learning. This study aims to benchmark multiple versions
of vanilla AEs (such as Linear, Convolutional and Variational) against their
Kolmogorov-Arnold counterparts that have same or less number of parameters.
Using cardiological signals as model input, a total of five different classic
AE tasks were studied: reconstruction, generation, denoising, inpainting and
anomaly detection. The proposed experiments uses a medical dataset

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs (TAGs) have emerged as a powerful representation for
modeling complex relationships across diverse domains. With the rise of large
language models (LLMs), there is growing interest in leveraging their
capabilities for graph learning. However, current approaches face significant
challenges in embedding structural information into LLM-compatible formats,
requiring either computationally expensive alignment mechanisms or manual graph
verbalization techniques that often lose critical structural details. Moreover,
these methods typically require labeled data from source domains for effective
transfer learning, significantly constraining their adaptability. We propose
STAG, a novel self-supervised framework that directly quantizes graph
structural information into discrete tokens using a frozen codebook. Unlike
traditional quantization approaches, our method employs soft assignment and KL
divergence guided quantization to address the unique challenges of graph data,
which lacks natural tokenization structures. Our framework enables both
LLM-based and traditional learning approaches, supporting true zero-shot
transfer learning without requiring labeled data even in the source domain.
Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across multiple
node classification benchmarks while maintaining compatibility with different
LLM architectures, offering an elegant solution to bridging graph learning with
LLMs.

Abstract: As green hydrogen emerges as a major component of global decarbonisation,
Oman has positioned itself strategically through national auctions and
international partnerships. Following two successful green hydrogen project
rounds, the country launched its third auction (R3) in the Duqm region. While
this area exhibits relative geospatial homogeneity, it is still vulnerable to
environmental fluctuations that pose inherent risks to productivity. Despite
growing global investment in green hydrogen, operational data remains scarce,
with major projects like Saudi Arabia's NEOM facility not expected to commence
production until 2026, and Oman's ACME Duqm project scheduled for 2028. This
absence of historical maintenance and performance data from large-scale
hydrogen facilities in desert environments creates a major knowledge gap for
accurate risk assessment for infrastructure planning and auction decisions.
Given this data void, environmental conditions emerge as accessible and
reliable proxy for predicting infrastructure maintenance pressures, because
harsh desert conditions such as dust storms, extreme temperatures, and humidity
fluctuations are well-documented drivers of equipment degradation in renewable
energy systems. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an Artificial
Intelligence decision support system that leverages publicly available
meteorological data to develop a predictive Maintenance Pressure Index (MPI),
which predicts risk levels and future maintenance demands on hydrogen
infrastructure. This tool strengthens regulatory foresight and operational
decision-making by enabling temporal benchmarking to assess and validate
performance claims over time. It can be used to incorporate temporal risk
intelligence into auction evaluation criteria despite the absence of historical
operational benchmarks.

### [320] [Clinical-Grade Blood Pressure Prediction in ICU Settings: An Ensemble Framework with Uncertainty Quantification and Cross-Institutional Validation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19530)
*Md Basit Azam,Sarangthem Ibotombi Singh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一个全面的框架，用于基于电子健康记录的血压预测，解决了现有机器学习方法的三大局限：缺乏外部验证、不确定性量化和数据泄漏预防。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重症监护病房中的血压监测至关重要，但现有机器学习方法存在外部验证不足、不确定性量化缺失和数据泄漏预防不充分的问题。

Method: 研究采用系统性数据泄漏预防、分位数回归进行不确定性量化，并在MIMIC-III和eICU数据库间进行外部验证。通过集成Gradient Boosting、Random Forest和XGBoost模型，结合74个生理特征。

Result: 内部验证表现良好（SBP: R²=0.86, RMSE=6.03 mmHg; DBP: R²=0.49, RMSE=7.13 mmHg），外部验证性能下降30%。不确定性量化生成有效预测区间（80.3% SBP和79.9% DBP覆盖率）。

Conclusion: 该框架为跨机构AI辅助血压监测提供了实际部署预期，代码已公开。

Abstract: Blood pressure (BP) monitoring is critical in in tensive care units (ICUs)
where hemodynamic instability can
  rapidly progress to cardiovascular collapse. Current machine
  learning (ML) approaches suffer from three limitations: lack of
  external validation, absence of uncertainty quantification, and
  inadequate data leakage prevention. This study presents the
  first comprehensive framework with novel algorithmic leakage
  prevention, uncertainty quantification, and cross-institutional
  validation for electronic health records (EHRs) based BP pre dictions. Our
methodology implemented systematic data leakage
  prevention, uncertainty quantification through quantile regres sion, and
external validation between the MIMIC-III and eICU
  databases. An ensemble framework combines Gradient Boosting,
  Random Forest, and XGBoost with 74 features across five
  physiological domains. Internal validation achieved a clinically
  acceptable performance (for SBP: R^2 = 0.86, RMSE = 6.03
  mmHg; DBP: R^2 = 0.49, RMSE = 7.13 mmHg), meeting AAMI
  standards. External validation showed 30% degradation with
  critical limitations in patients with hypotensive. Uncertainty
  quantification generated valid prediction intervals (80.3% SBP
  and 79.9% DBP coverage), enabling risk-stratified protocols
  with narrow intervals (< 15 mmHg) for standard monitoring
  and wide intervals (> 30 mmHg) for manual verification. This
  framework provides realistic deployment expectations for cross institutional
AI-assisted BP monitoring in critical care settings.

*Ali Shakeri,Wei Emma Zhang,Amin Beheshti,Weitong Chen,Jian Yang,Lishan Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedDPG是一种结合动态提示生成器和联邦学习的方法，旨在提高模型灵活性并保护数据隐私，同时减少计算和通信开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统提示调优方法缺乏灵活性，而联邦学习在数据隐私保护方面存在计算和通信限制。

Method: 引入动态提示生成器网络，生成上下文感知提示，并在联邦学习框架中优化计算和通信效率。

Result: 在三个NLP基准数据集上，FedDPG优于现有参数高效调优方法，显著减少了计算时间和通信参数数量。

Conclusion: FedDPG在保持数据隐私的同时，提高了模型性能和效率，为联邦学习中的NLP任务提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
in various NLP tasks. However, traditional fine-tuning methods for leveraging
PLMs for downstream tasks entail significant computational overhead.
Prompt-tuning has emerged as an efficient alternative that involves prepending
a limited number of parameters to the input sequence and only updating them
while the PLM's parameters are frozen. However, this technique's prompts remain
fixed for all inputs, reducing the model's flexibility. The Federated Learning
(FL) technique has gained attention in recent years to address the growing
concerns around data privacy. However, challenges such as communication and
computation limitations of clients still need to be addressed. To mitigate
these challenges, this paper introduces the Federated Dynamic Prompt Generator
(FedDPG), which incorporates a dynamic prompt generator network to generate
context-aware prompts based on the given input, ensuring flexibility and
adaptability while prioritising data privacy in federated learning settings.
Our experiments on three NLP benchmark datasets showcase that FedDPG
outperforms the state-of-the-art parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods in
terms of global model performance, and has significantly reduced the
calculation time and the number of parameters to be sent through the FL
network.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统材料合成方法效率低且成本高，尤其是金属玻璃的合成需要多元素优化组合，数据稀缺和材料编码不成熟限制了统计学习算法的预测能力。

Method: 利用维基百科的语言模型编码节点元素，设计多种图神经网络架构作为推荐系统，探索材料间的隐藏关系。

Result: 通过多语言维基百科嵌入评估自然语言在材料设计中的能力，为新材料发现提供了新范式。

Conclusion: 研究为人工智能驱动的非晶材料及其他新材料的设计开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Synthesizing new materials efficiently is highly demanded in various research
fields. However, this process is usually slow and expensive, especially for
metallic glasses, whose formation strongly depends on the optimal combinations
of multiple elements to resist crystallization. This constraint renders only
several thousands of candidates explored in the vast material space since 1960.
Recently, data-driven approaches armed by advanced machine learning techniques
provided alternative routes for intelligent materials design. Due to data
scarcity and immature material encoding, the conventional tabular data is
usually mined by statistical learning algorithms, giving limited model
predictability and generalizability. Here, we propose sophisticated data
learning from material network representations. The node elements are encoded
from the Wikipedia by a language model. Graph neural networks with versatile
architectures are designed to serve as recommendation systems to explore hidden
relationships among materials. By employing Wikipedia embeddings from different
languages, we assess the capability of natural languages in materials design.
Our study proposes a new paradigm to harvesting new amorphous materials and
beyond with artificial intelligence.

TL;DR: Javed等人（2024）提出了一种名为SwiftTD的新算法，改进了True Online TD(λ)，并扩展到控制问题，开发了Swift-Sarsa。在实验中，Swift-Sarsa成功解决了操作条件基准中的信号区分问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进现有TD学习算法，解决控制问题中的信号区分和噪声过滤挑战。

Method: 结合SwiftTD和True Online Sarsa(λ)开发Swift-Sarsa算法，应用于操作条件基准。

Result: Swift-Sarsa能有效区分相关信号与噪声，无需先验知识。

Conclusion: Swift-Sarsa为解决大规模特征搜索问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Javed, Sharifnassab, and Sutton (2024) introduced a new algorithm for TD
learning -- SwiftTD -- that augments True Online TD($\lambda$) with step-size
optimization, a bound on the effective learning rate, and step-size decay. In
their experiments SwiftTD outperformed True Online TD($\lambda$) and
TD($\lambda$) on a variety of prediction tasks derived from Atari games, and
its performance was robust to the choice of hyper-parameters. In this extended
abstract we extend SwiftTD to work for control problems. We combine the key
ideas behind SwiftTD with True Online Sarsa($\lambda$) to develop an on-policy
reinforcement learning algorithm called $\textit{Swift-Sarsa}$.
  We propose a simple benchmark for linear on-policy control called the
$\textit{operant conditioning benchmark}$. The key challenge in the operant
conditioning benchmark is that a very small subset of input signals are
relevant for decision making. The majority of the signals are noise sampled
from a non-stationary distribution. To learn effectively, the agent must learn
to differentiate between the relevant signals and the noisy signals, and
minimize prediction errors by assigning credit to the weight parameters
associated with the relevant signals.
  Swift-Sarsa, when applied to the operant conditioning benchmark, learned to
assign credit to the relevant signals without any prior knowledge of the
structure of the problem. It opens the door for solution methods that learn
representations by searching over hundreds of millions of features in parallel
without performance degradation due to noisy or bad features.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于卷积自编码器的深度学习框架，用于从心房颤动（AF）的心内电图中无监督提取特征，以帮助识别AF驱动源。


<details>

Motivation: 当前消融疗法对持续性AF效果不佳，因非肺静脉驱动源的存在，需更有效的方法识别这些驱动源。

Method: 使用卷积自编码器从单极和双极心内电图中提取无监督特征，保留形态特征并用于下游分类。

Result: 模型在检测旋转和局灶活动时表现中等（AUC 0.73-0.76），识别心房电图纠缠时表现优异（AUC 0.93）。

Conclusion: 该方法可实时运行，并集成到临床电解剖标测系统中，展示了无监督学习在心脏信号分析中的潜力。

Abstract: Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent sustained arrhythmia, yet
current ablation therapies, including pulmonary vein isolation, are frequently
ineffective in persistent AF due to the involvement of non-pulmonary vein
drivers. This study proposes a deep learning framework using convolutional
autoencoders for unsupervised feature extraction from unipolar and bipolar
intracavitary electrograms (EGMs) recorded during AF in ablation studies. These
latent representations of atrial electrical activity enable the
characterization and automation of EGM analysis, facilitating the detection of
AF drivers.
  The database consisted of 11,404 acquisitions recorded from 291 patients,
containing 228,080 unipolar EGMs and 171,060 bipolar EGMs. The autoencoders
successfully learned latent representations with low reconstruction loss,
preserving the morphological features. The extracted embeddings allowed
downstream classifiers to detect rotational and focal activity with moderate
performance (AUC 0.73-0.76) and achieved high discriminative performance in
identifying atrial EGM entanglement (AUC 0.93).
  The proposed method can operate in real-time and enables integration into
clinical electroanatomical mapping systems to assist in identifying
arrhythmogenic regions during ablation procedures. This work highlights the
potential of unsupervised learning to uncover physiologically meaningful
features from intracardiac signals.

Result: BEASTAL能够完成任何线性任务，并在局部规则非线性时表现最佳。

Conclusion: BEASTAL通过简单局部规则实现高效学习，无需复杂架构或大规模存储。

Abstract: Machine Learning, however popular and accessible, is computationally
intensive and highly power-consuming, prompting interest in alternative
physical implementations of learning tasks. We introduce a training scheme for
physical systems that minimize power dissipation in which only boundary
parameters (i.e. inputs and outputs) are externally controlled. Using this
scheme, these Boundary-Enabled Adaptive State Tuning Systems (BEASTS) learn by
exploiting local physical rules. Our scheme, BEASTAL (BEAST-Adaline), is the
closest analog of the Adaline algorithm for such systems. We demonstrate this
autonomous learning in silico for regression and classification tasks. Our
approach advances previous physical learning schemes by using intuitive, local
evolution rules without requiring large-scale memory or complex internal
architectures. BEASTAL can perform any linear task, achieving best performance
when the local evolution rule is non-linear.

Abstract: We propose an efficient federated dual decomposition algorithm for
calculating the Wasserstein barycenter of several distributions, including
choosing the support of the solution. The algorithm does not access local data
and uses only highly aggregated information. It also does not require repeated
solutions to mass transportation problems. Because of the absence of any
matrix-vector operations, the algorithm exhibits a very low complexity of each
iteration and significant scalability. We illustrate its virtues and compare it
to the state-of-the-art methods on several examples of mixture models.

Abstract: AI agents are emerging as a dominant workload in a wide range of
applications, promising to be the vehicle that delivers the promised benefits
of AI to enterprises and consumers. Unlike conventional software or static
inference, agentic workloads are dynamic and structurally complex. Often these
agents are directed graphs of compute and IO operations that span multi-modal
data input and conversion), data processing and context gathering (e.g vector
DB lookups), multiple LLM inferences, tool calls, etc. To scale AI agent usage,
we need efficient and scalable deployment and agent-serving infrastructure.
  To tackle this challenge, in this paper, we present a system design for
dynamic orchestration of AI agent workloads on heterogeneous compute
infrastructure spanning CPUs and accelerators, both from different vendors and
across different performance tiers within a single vendor. The system delivers
several building blocks: a framework for planning and optimizing agentic AI
execution graphs using cost models that account for compute, memory, and
bandwidth constraints of different HW; a MLIR based representation and
compilation system that can decompose AI agent execution graphs into granular
operators and generate code for different HW options; and a dynamic
orchestration system that can place the granular components across a
heterogeneous compute infrastructure and stitch them together while meeting an
end-to-end SLA. Our design performs a systems level TCO optimization and
preliminary results show that leveraging a heterogeneous infrastructure can
deliver significant TCO benefits. A preliminary surprising finding is that for
some workloads a heterogeneous combination of older generation GPUs with newer
accelerators can deliver similar TCO as the latest generation homogenous GPU
infrastructure design, potentially extending the life of deployed
infrastructure.

Result: 在50只S&P 500股票的投资组合中，新方法在2021-2023年测试期间分别实现51.42%、51.04%和48.62%的回报，优于强化学习基准方法。

Conclusion: 新提出的损失函数结合时间序列模型能有效生成高回报交易策略，优于现有技术。

Abstract: Stock trading has always been a challenging task due to the highly volatile
nature of the stock market. Making sound trading decisions to generate profit
is particularly difficult under such conditions. To address this, we propose
four novel loss functions to drive decision-making for a portfolio of stocks.
These functions account for the potential profits or losses based with respect
to buying or shorting respective stocks, enabling potentially any artificial
neural network to directly learn an effective trading strategy. Despite the
high volatility in stock market fluctuations over time, training time-series
models such as transformers on these loss functions resulted in trading
strategies that generated significant profits on a portfolio of 50 different
S&P 500 company stocks as compared to a benchmark reinforcment learning
techniques and a baseline buy and hold method. As an example, using 2021, 2022
and 2023 as three test periods, the Crossformer model adapted with our best
loss function was most consistent, resulting in returns of 51.42%, 51.04% and
48.62% respectively. In comparison, the best performing state-of-the-art
reinforcement learning methods, PPO and DDPG, only delivered maximum profits of
around 41%, 2.81% and 41.58% for the same periods. The code is available at

Motivation: 研究神经网络为何在某些任务（如阶梯函数）上显著优于核方法，并探讨现有特征学习理论的局限性。

Method: 引入“特征质量”概念，评估现有特征学习理论，并通过实验验证其局限性。

Result: 现有理论主要衡量特征学习的强度，而非特征质量，无法为神经网络泛化提供充分理论基础。

Conclusion: 需要新的理论框架来更全面地评估特征质量，以解释神经网络的泛化能力。

Abstract: Neural networks outperform kernel methods, sometimes by orders of magnitude,
e.g. on staircase functions. This advantage stems from the ability of neural
networks to learn features, adapting their hidden representations to better
capture the data. We introduce a concept we call feature quality to measure
this performance improvement. We examine existing theories of feature learning
and demonstrate empirically that they primarily assess the strength of feature
learning, rather than the quality of the learned features themselves.
Consequently, current theories of feature learning do not provide a sufficient
foundation for developing theories of neural network generalization.

Abstract: Imagine a humanoid that can safely and creatively dance with a human,
adapting to its partner's proficiency, using haptic signaling as a primary form
of communication. While today's AI systems excel at text or voice-based
interaction with large language models, human communication extends far beyond
text-it includes embodied movement, timing, and physical coordination. Modeling
coupled interaction between two agents poses a formidable challenge: it is
continuous, bidirectionally reactive, and shaped by individual variation. We
present CoMPAS3D, the largest and most diverse motion capture dataset of
improvised salsa dancing, designed as a challenging testbed for interactive,
expressive humanoid AI. The dataset includes 3 hours of leader-follower salsa
dances performed by 18 dancers spanning beginner, intermediate, and
professional skill levels. For the first time, we provide fine-grained salsa
expert annotations, covering over 2,800 move segments, including move types,
combinations, execution errors and stylistic elements. We draw analogies
between partner dance communication and natural language, evaluating CoMPAS3D
on two benchmark tasks for synthetic humans that parallel key problems in
spoken language and dialogue processing: leader or follower generation with
proficiency levels (speaker or listener synthesis), and duet (conversation)
generation. Towards a long-term goal of partner dance with humans, we release
the dataset, annotations, and code, along with a multitask SalsaAgent model
capable of performing all benchmark tasks, alongside additional baselines to
encourage research in socially interactive embodied AI and creative, expressive
humanoid motion generation.

Motivation: CAN协议缺乏安全机制，易受攻击，需高效检测方法。

Result: 学生模型在Car-Hacking和Car-Survival数据集上分别达到99.97%和99.31%准确率。

Conclusion: KD-GAT效果显著，但需解决数据集类别不平衡问题。

Abstract: The Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol is widely adopted for in-vehicle
communication but lacks inherent security mechanisms, making it vulnerable to
cyberattacks. This paper introduces KD-GAT, an intrusion detection framework
that combines Graph Attention Networks (GATs) with knowledge distillation (KD)
to enhance detection accuracy while reducing computational complexity. In our
approach, CAN traffic is represented as graphs using a sliding window to
capture temporal and relational patterns. A multi-layer GAT with jumping
knowledge aggregation acting as the teacher model, while a compact student
GAT--only 6.32% the size of the teacher--is trained via a two-phase process
involving supervised pretraining and knowledge distillation with both soft and
hard label supervision. Experiments on three benchmark datasets--Car-Hacking,
Car-Survival, and can-train-and-test demonstrate that both teacher and student
models achieve strong results, with the student model attaining 99.97% and
99.31% accuracy on Car-Hacking and Car-Survival, respectively. However,
significant class imbalance in can-train-and-test has led to reduced
performance for both models on this dataset. Addressing this imbalance remains
an important direction for future work.

Motivation: 传统方法仅依赖地理距离，无法解释商业语义对顾客流动的影响，因此需要一种能结合空间和商业关系的新方法。

Method: 采用图神经网络（GraphSAGE），结合商业分类知识（NAICS编码）和空间、时间、社会经济特征，通过状态分解实现大规模数据处理。

Conclusion: 商业语义信息对共访模式预测至关重要，新方法在性能和可扩展性上均优于现有技术。

Abstract: Understanding where people go after visiting one business is crucial for
urban planning, retail analytics, and location-based services. However,
predicting these co-visitation patterns across millions of venues remains
challenging due to extreme data sparsity and the complex interplay between
spatial proximity and business relationships. Traditional approaches using only
geographic distance fail to capture why coffee shops attract different customer
flows than fine dining restaurants, even when co-located. We introduce
NAICS-aware GraphSAGE, a novel graph neural network that integrates business
taxonomy knowledge through learnable embeddings to predict population-scale
co-visitation patterns. Our key insight is that business semantics, captured
through detailed industry codes, provide crucial signals that pure spatial
models cannot explain. The approach scales to massive datasets (4.2 billion
potential venue pairs) through efficient state-wise decomposition while
combining spatial, temporal, and socioeconomic features in an end-to-end
framework. Evaluated on our POI-Graph dataset comprising 94.9 million
co-visitation records across 92,486 brands and 48 US states, our method
achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines: the
R-squared value increases from 0.243 to 0.625 (a 157 percent improvement), with
strong gains in ranking quality (32 percent improvement in NDCG at 10).

Abstract: We propose a new framework for generating cross-sectional synthetic datasets
via disjoint generative models. In this paradigm, a dataset is partitioned into
disjoint subsets that are supplied to separate instances of generative models.
The results are then combined post hoc by a joining operation that works in the
absence of common variables/identifiers. The success of the framework is
demonstrated through several case studies and examples on tabular data that
helps illuminate some of the design choices that one may make. The principal
benefit of disjoint generative models is significantly increased privacy at
only a low utility cost. Additional findings include increased effectiveness
and feasibility for certain model types and the possibility for mixed-model
synthesis.

Abstract: Vector databases typically rely on approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search

effective, this approach often yields semantically redundant results, missing
the diversity and contextual richness required by applications such as

agents. We introduce a new retrieval paradigm: semantic compression, which aims
to select a compact, representative set of vectors that captures the broader
semantic structure around a query. We formalize this objective using principles
from submodular optimization and information geometry, and show that it
generalizes traditional top-k retrieval by prioritizing coverage and diversity.
To operationalize this idea, we propose graph-augmented vector retrieval, which
overlays semantic graphs (e.g., kNN or knowledge-based links) atop vector
spaces to enable multi-hop, context-aware search. We theoretically analyze the
limitations of proximity-based retrieval under high-dimensional concentration
and highlight how graph structures can improve semantic coverage. Our work
outlines a foundation for meaning-centric vector search systems, emphasizing
hybrid indexing, diversity-aware querying, and structured semantic retrieval.
We make our implementation publicly available to foster future research in this
area.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DisasterMobLLM的框架，用于预测灾害场景下的人类移动行为，通过结合LLM和RAG技术，显著提升了预测准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市化与气候变化加剧了城市对自然灾害的脆弱性，现有的人类移动预测模型在灾害场景下表现不佳，亟需改进。

Method: 框架包括RAG增强的意图预测器、基于LLM的意图优化器和意图调制的定位预测器，通过LLM建模移动意图并迁移灾害影响知识。

Result: 实验显示，DisasterMobLLM在Acc@1和预测静止的F1分数上分别提升了32.8%和35.0%。

Conclusion: DisasterMobLLM有效解决了灾害场景下人类移动预测的挑战，为灾害预警和救援资源分配提供了支持。

Abstract: The vulnerability of cities to natural disasters has increased with
urbanization and climate change, making it more important to predict human
mobility in the disaster scenarios for downstream tasks including
location-based early disaster warning and pre-allocating rescue resources, etc.
However, existing human mobility prediction models are mainly designed for
normal scenarios, and fail to adapt to disaster scenarios due to the shift of
human mobility patterns under disaster. To address this issue, we introduce
\textbf{DisasterMobLLM}, a mobility prediction framework for disaster scenarios
that can be integrated into existing deep mobility prediction methods by
leveraging LLMs to model the mobility intention and transferring the common
knowledge of how different disasters affect mobility intentions between cities.
This framework utilizes a RAG-Enhanced Intention Predictor to forecast the next
intention, refines it with an LLM-based Intention Refiner, and then maps the
intention to an exact location using an Intention-Modulated Location Predictor.
Extensive experiments illustrate that DisasterMobLLM can achieve a 32.8\%
improvement in terms of Acc@1 and a 35.0\% improvement in terms of the F1-score
of predicting immobility compared to the baselines. The code is available at
https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/DisasterMobLLM.

Abstract: Developing enzymes with desired thermal properties is crucial for a wide
range of industrial and research applications, and determining temperature
stability is an essential step in this process. Experimental determination of
thermal parameters is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and costly. Moreover,
existing computational approaches are often hindered by limited data
availability and imbalanced distributions. To address these challenges, we
introduce a curated temperature stability dataset designed for model
development and benchmarking in enzyme thermal modeling. Leveraging this
dataset, we present the \textit{Segment Transformer}, a novel deep learning
framework that enables efficient and accurate prediction of enzyme temperature
stability. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance with an RMSE of
24.03, MAE of 18.09, and Pearson and Spearman correlations of 0.33,
respectively. These results highlight the effectiveness of incorporating
segment-level representations, grounded in the biological observation that
different regions of a protein sequence contribute unequally to thermal
behavior. As a proof of concept, we applied the Segment Transformer to guide
the engineering of a cutinase enzyme. Experimental validation demonstrated a
1.64-fold improvement in relative activity following heat treatment, achieved
through only 17 mutations and without compromising catalytic function.

Abstract: Structural drawings are widely used in many fields, e.g., mechanical
engineering, civil engineering, etc. In civil engineering, structural drawings
serve as the main communication tool between architects, engineers, and
builders to avoid conflicts, act as legal documentation, and provide a
reference for future maintenance or evaluation needs. They are often organized
using key elements such as title/subtitle blocks, scales, plan views, elevation
view, sections, and detailed sections, which are annotated with standardized
symbols and line types for interpretation by engineers and contractors. Despite
advances in software capabilities, the task of generating a structural drawing
remains labor-intensive and time-consuming for structural engineers. Here we
introduce a novel generative AI-based method for generating structural drawings
employing a large language model (LLM) agent. The method incorporates a
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technique using externally-sourced facts
to enhance the accuracy and reliability of the language model. This method is
capable of understanding varied natural language descriptions, processing these
to extract necessary information, and generating code to produce the desired
structural drawing in AutoCAD. The approach developed, demonstrated and
evaluated herein enables the efficient and direct conversion of a structural
drawing's natural language description into an AutoCAD drawing, significantly
reducing the workload compared to current working process associated with
manual drawing production, facilitating the typical iterative process of
engineers for expressing design ideas in a simplified way.

risk of progression. Clinical tools like the EORTC risk tables are outdated and
unreliable - especially for intermediate-risk cases.
  We propose an interpretable AI model using the Tsetlin Machine (TM), a
symbolic learner that outputs transparent, human-readable logic. Tested on the
PHOTO trial dataset (n=330), TM achieved an F1-score of 0.80, outperforming
XGBoost (0.78), Logistic Regression (0.60), and EORTC (0.42). TM reveals the
exact clauses behind each prediction, grounded in clinical features like tumour
count, surgeon experience, and hospital stay - offering accuracy and full
transparency. This makes TM a powerful, trustworthy decision-support tool ready
for real-world adoption.

Result: 本地优化器和学习率的选择比FL方法本身对性能影响更大；本地训练轮数的效果因方法而异。

Conclusion: 在联邦学习中，合适的本地配置比算法复杂性更重要。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a collaborative learning method that enables
decentralized model training while preserving data privacy. Despite its promise
in medical imaging, recent FL methods are often sensitive to local factors such
as optimizers and learning rates, limiting their robustness in practical
deployments. In this work, we revisit vanilla FL to clarify the impact of edge
device configurations, benchmarking recent FL methods on colorectal pathology
and blood cell classification task. We numerically show that the choice of
local optimizer and learning rate has a greater effect on performance than the
specific FL method. Moreover, we find that increasing local training epochs can
either enhance or impair convergence, depending on the FL method. These
findings indicate that appropriate edge-specific configuration is more crucial
than algorithmic complexity for achieving effective FL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP在持续学习多任务时会出现灾难性遗忘和嵌入对齐退化问题，影响其零-shot能力。

Method: 使用梯度零空间投影（GNSP）防止任务间干扰，结合知识蒸馏和模态对齐损失保持嵌入空间结构。

Result: 在MTIL基准测试中取得SOTA性能，保持了CLIP的模态差距和跨模态检索性能。

Conclusion: GNSP方法有效解决了持续学习中的遗忘问题，同时保持了CLIP的泛化能力。

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining has demonstrated remarkable zero-shot
generalization by aligning visual and textual modalities in a shared embedding
space. However, when continuously fine-tuned on diverse tasks, CLIP suffers
from catastrophic forgetting and degradation of its embedding alignment,
undermining its zero-shot capabilities. In this work, we propose Gradient Null
Space Projection (GNSP), an efficient continual learning method that projects
task-specific gradients onto the null space of previously learned knowledge.
This orthogonal projection mathematically prevents interference with previous
tasks without relying on rehearsal or architectural modification. Furthermore,
to preserve the inherent generalization property of CLIP, we introduce
knowledge distillation and combine it with a modality alignment preservation
loss inspired by CLIP pre-training to stabilize the structure of the multimodal
embedding space during fine-tuning. On the MTIL benchmark consisting of 11
tasks, our method achieved SOTA performance on both the Average and Last key
metrics. More importantly, experiments show that our method successfully
maintains the original modality gap and cross-modal retrieval performance of
CLIP, confirming its effectiveness in maintaining a robust visual-language
space throughout the continual learning process.

Abstract: Resolution of incidents or problem tickets is a common theme in service
industries in any sector, including billing and charging systems in telecom
domain. Machine learning can help to identify patterns and suggest resolutions
for the problem tickets, based on patterns in the historical data of the
tickets. However, this process may be complicated due to a variety of phenomena
such as data drift and issues such as missing data, lack of data pertaining to
resolutions of past incidents, too many similar sounding resolutions due to
free text and similar sounding text. This paper proposes a robust ML-driven
solution employing clustering, supervised learning, and advanced NLP models to
tackle these challenges effectively. Building on previous work, we demonstrate
clustering-based resolution identification, supervised classification with LDA,
Siamese networks, and One-shot learning, Index embedding. Additionally, we
present a real-time dashboard and a highly available Kubernetes-based
production deployment. Our experiments with both the open-source Bitext

Method: 提出ARPO算法，结合熵自适应机制和优势估计，动态平衡全局轨迹和步级采样。

Result: 在13个基准测试中表现优异，仅需现有方法一半的工具使用预算。

Conclusion: ARPO为LLM代理在动态环境中的对齐提供了可扩展解决方案。

Abstract: Large-scale reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has
demonstrated its effectiveness in harnessing the potential of large language
models (LLMs) for single-turn reasoning tasks. In realistic reasoning
scenarios, LLMs can often utilize external tools to assist in task-solving
processes. However, current RL algorithms inadequately balance the models'
intrinsic long-horizon reasoning capabilities and their proficiency in
multi-turn tool interactions. To bridge this gap, we propose Agentic Reinforced
Policy Optimization (ARPO), a novel agentic RL algorithm tailored for training
multi-turn LLM-based agents. Through preliminary experiments, we observe that
LLMs tend to exhibit highly uncertain behavior, characterized by an increase in
the entropy distribution of generated tokens, immediately following
interactions with external tools. Motivated by this observation, ARPO
incorporates an entropy-based adaptive rollout mechanism, dynamically balancing
global trajectory sampling and step-level sampling, thereby promoting
exploration at steps with high uncertainty after tool usage. By integrating an
advantage attribution estimation, ARPO enables LLMs to internalize advantage
differences in stepwise tool-use interactions. Our experiments across 13
challenging benchmarks in computational reasoning, knowledge reasoning, and
deep search domains demonstrate ARPO's superiority over trajectory-level RL
algorithms. Remarkably, ARPO achieves improved performance using only half of
the tool-use budget required by existing methods, offering a scalable solution
for aligning LLM-based agents with real-time dynamic environments. Our code and
datasets are released at https://github.com/dongguanting/ARPO

Motivation: LLM缺乏对物理动态的直观理解，限制了其在需要因果推理的实际场景中的有效性。

Method: 引入Causal World Model Induction (CWMI)框架，包含Causal Physics Module (CPM)和Causal Intervention Loss训练目标。

Result: CWMI在零样本物理推理任务（如PIQA和PhysiCa-Bench）上显著优于现有LLM。

Conclusion: 诱导因果世界模型是实现更可靠、泛化性更强的AI系统的关键步骤。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their advanced linguistic capabilities,
fundamentally lack an intuitive understanding of physical dynamics, which
limits their effectiveness in real-world scenarios that require causal
reasoning. In this paper, we introduce Causal World Model Induction (CWMI), a
novel framework designed to embed an explicit model of causal physics within an
LLM. Our approach incorporates a dedicated Causal Physics Module (CPM) and a
new training objective called Causal Intervention Loss, encouraging the model
to learn cause-and-effect relationships from multimodal data. By training the
model to predict the outcomes of hypothetical interventions instead of merely
capturing statistical correlations, CWMI develops a robust internal
representation of physical laws. Experimental results show that CWMI
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs on zero-shot physical reasoning
tasks, including the PIQA benchmark and our newly proposed PhysiCa-Bench
dataset. These findings demonstrate that inducing a causal world model is a
critical step toward more reliable and generalizable AI systems.

Abstract: Landmine removal is a slow, resource-intensive process affecting over 60
countries. While AI has been proposed to enhance explosive ordnance (EO)
detection, existing methods primarily focus on object recognition, with limited
attention to prediction of landmine risk based on spatial pattern information.
This work aims to answer the following research question: How can AI be used to
predict landmine risk from landmine patterns to improve clearance time
efficiency? To that effect, we introduce RestoreAI, an AI system for
pattern-based risk estimation of remaining explosives. RestoreAI is the first
AI system that leverages landmine patterns for risk prediction, improving the
accuracy of estimating the residual risk of missing EO prior to land release.
We particularly focus on the implementation of three instances of RestoreAI,
respectively, linear, curved and Bayesian pattern deminers. First, the linear
pattern deminer uses linear landmine patterns from a principal component
analysis (PCA) for the landmine risk prediction. Second, the curved pattern
deminer uses curved landmine patterns from principal curves. Finally, the
Bayesian pattern deminer incorporates prior expert knowledge by using a
Bayesian pattern risk prediction. Evaluated on real-world landmine data,
RestoreAI significantly boosts clearance efficiency. The top-performing
pattern-based deminers achieved a 14.37 percentage point increase in the
average share of cleared landmines per timestep and required 24.45% less time
than the best baseline deminer to locate all landmines. Interestingly, linear
and curved pattern deminers showed no significant performance difference,
suggesting that more efficient linear patterns are a viable option for risk
prediction.

Result: CLoRA性能与基线方法相当或更优，同时大幅降低硬件需求。

Conclusion: CLoRA适合资源受限环境，为持续学习提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: In the past, continual learning (CL) was mostly concerned with the problem of
catastrophic forgetting in neural networks, that arises when incrementally
learning a sequence of tasks. Current CL methods function within the confines
of limited data access, without any restrictions imposed on computational
resources. However, in real-world scenarios, the latter takes precedence as
deployed systems are often computationally constrained. A major drawback of
most CL methods is the need to retrain the entire model for each new task. The
computational demands of retraining large models can be prohibitive, limiting
the applicability of CL in environments with limited resources. Through CLoRA,
we explore the applicability of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), a
parameter-efficient fine-tuning method for class-incremental semantic
segmentation. CLoRA leverages a small set of parameters of the model and uses
the same set for learning across all tasks. Results demonstrate the efficacy of
CLoRA, achieving performance on par with and exceeding the baseline methods. We
further evaluate CLoRA using NetScore, underscoring the need to factor in
resource efficiency and evaluate CL methods beyond task performance. CLoRA
significantly reduces the hardware requirements for training, making it
well-suited for CL in resource-constrained environments after deployment.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative models, associated privacy concerns
have attracted growing attention. To address this, researchers have begun
adapting machine unlearning techniques from traditional classification models
to generative settings. Although notable progress has been made in this area, a
unified framework for systematically organizing and integrating existing work
is still lacking. The substantial differences among current studies in terms of
unlearning objectives and evaluation protocols hinder the objective and fair
comparison of various approaches. While some studies focus on specific types of
generative models, they often overlook the commonalities and systematic
characteristics inherent in Generative Model Unlearning (GenMU). To bridge this
gap, we provide a comprehensive review of current research on GenMU and propose
a unified analytical framework for categorizing unlearning objectives,
methodological strategies, and evaluation metrics. In addition, we explore the
connections between GenMU and related techniques, including model editing,
reinforcement learning from human feedback, and controllable generation. We
further highlight the potential practical value of unlearning techniques in
real-world applications. Finally, we identify key challenges and outline future
research directions aimed at laying a solid foundation for further advancements
in this field. We consistently maintain the related open-source materials at

Conclusion: 研究强调了联邦图学习中客户端身份泄露的风险，呼吁设计更具鲁棒性的GNN模型以应对此类隐私威胁。

Abstract: Graph-structured data is prevalent in many real-world applications, including
social networks, financial systems, and molecular biology. Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) have become the de facto standard for learning from such data
due to their strong representation capabilities. As GNNs are increasingly
deployed in federated learning (FL) settings to preserve data locality and
privacy, new privacy threats arise from the interaction between graph
structures and decentralized training. In this paper, we present the first
systematic study of cross-client membership inference attacks (CC-MIA) against
node classification tasks of federated GNNs (FedGNNs), where a malicious client
aims to infer which client owns the given data. Unlike prior
centralized-focused work that focuses on whether a sample was included in
training, our attack targets sample-to-client attribution, a finer-grained
privacy risk unique to federated settings. We design a general attack framework
that exploits FedGNNs' aggregation behaviors, gradient updates, and embedding
proximity to link samples to their source clients across training rounds. We
evaluate our attack across multiple graph datasets under realistic FL setups.
Results show that our method achieves high performance on both membership
inference and ownership identification. Our findings highlight a new privacy
threat in federated graph learning-client identity leakage through structural
and model-level cues, motivating the need for attribution-robust GNN design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 一阶优化方法（如SGD和Adam）在大规模神经网络训练中表现良好，但难以应对复杂损失函数中的平坦区域和鞍点。二阶方法虽然有效，但计算成本高。DEO旨在通过一阶方法模拟二阶信息，解决这一问题。

Method: DEO基于Dimer方法，通过构造两个邻近点估计局部曲率，近似Hessian矩阵的最小特征向量，并周期性地将梯度投影到最小曲率方向的正交子空间，避免陷入鞍点和平坦区域。

Result: 在Transformer玩具模型上的初步实验表明，DEO在复杂损失函数中的表现优于标准一阶方法。

Conclusion: DEO成功将物理学启发的曲率估计方法应用于神经网络训练，为一阶优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: First-order optimization methods, such as SGD and Adam, are widely used for
training large-scale deep neural networks due to their computational efficiency
and robust performance. However, relying solely on gradient information, these
methods often struggle to navigate complex loss landscapes with flat regions,
plateaus, and saddle points. Second-order methods, which use curvature
information from the Hessian matrix, can address these challenges but are
computationally infeasible for large models. The Dimer method, a first-order
technique that constructs two closely spaced points to probe the local geometry
of a potential energy surface, efficiently estimates curvature using only
gradient information. Inspired by its use in molecular dynamics simulations for
locating saddle points, we propose Dimer-Enhanced Optimization (DEO), a novel
framework to escape saddle points in neural network training. DEO adapts the
Dimer method to explore a broader region of the loss landscape, approximating
the Hessian's smallest eigenvector without computing the full matrix. By
periodically projecting the gradient onto the subspace orthogonal to the
minimum curvature direction, DEO guides the optimizer away from saddle points
and flat regions, enhancing training efficiency with non-stepwise updates.
Preliminary experiments on a Transformer toy model show DEO achieves
competitive performance compared to standard first-order methods, improving
navigation of complex loss landscapes. Our work repurposes physics-inspired,
first-order curvature estimation to enhance neural network training in
high-dimensional spaces.

Abstract: Precise fare prediction is crucial in ride-hailing platforms and urban
mobility systems. This study examines three machine learning models-Graph
Attention Networks (GAT), XGBoost, and TimesNet to evaluate their predictive
capabilities for taxi fares using a real-world dataset comprising over 55
million records. Both raw (noisy) and denoised versions of the dataset are
analyzed to assess the impact of data quality on model performance. The study
evaluated the models along multiple axes, including predictive accuracy,
calibration, uncertainty estimation, out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness, and
feature sensitivity. We also explore pre-processing strategies, including KNN
imputation, Gaussian noise injection, and autoencoder-based denoising. The
study reveals critical differences between classical and deep learning models
under realistic conditions, offering practical guidelines for building robust
and scalable models in urban fare prediction systems.

*Liu junkang,Yuanyuan Liu,Fanhua Shang,Hongying Liu,Jin Liu,Wei Feng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出两种新联邦学习算法（FedSWA和FedMoSWA），旨在解决数据异构性对泛化能力的影响，并在理论和实验上验证其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究联邦学习在数据异构性下的泛化问题，发现FedSAM在高度异构数据中表现不佳，需改进算法。

Method: 提出FedSWA（基于随机权重平均）和FedMoSWA（基于动量的随机控制权重平均）算法，以寻找更平坦的最小值并优化模型对齐。

Result: 理论分析证明FedMoSWA的优化和泛化误差更小；实验在CIFAR10/100和Tiny ImageNet上验证了算法的优越性。

Conclusion: FedSWA和FedMoSWA在高度异构数据中表现优于现有算法，为联邦学习提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: For federated learning (FL) algorithms such as FedSAM, their generalization
capability is crucial for real-word applications. In this paper, we revisit the
generalization problem in FL and investigate the impact of data heterogeneity
on FL generalization. We find that FedSAM usually performs worse than FedAvg in
the case of highly heterogeneous data, and thus propose a novel and effective
federated learning algorithm with Stochastic Weight Averaging (called
\texttt{FedSWA}), which aims to find flatter minima in the setting of highly
heterogeneous data. Moreover, we introduce a new momentum-based stochastic
controlled weight averaging FL algorithm (\texttt{FedMoSWA}), which is designed
to better align local and global models.
  Theoretically, we provide both convergence analysis and generalization bounds
for \texttt{FedSWA} and \texttt{FedMoSWA}. We also prove that the optimization
and generalization errors of \texttt{FedMoSWA} are smaller than those of their
counterparts, including FedSAM and its variants. Empirically, experimental
results on CIFAR10/100 and Tiny ImageNet demonstrate the superiority of the
proposed algorithms compared to their counterparts. Open source code at:

### [351] [Irredundant $k$-Fold Cross-Validation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20048)
*Jesus S. Aguilar-Ruiz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的Irredundant k-fold交叉验证方法，确保每个实例仅用于一次训练和一次测试，减少冗余和过拟合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统k-fold交叉验证中，实例重复使用可能导致不平衡和过拟合，需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 通过Irredundant k-fold交叉验证，每个实例仅用于一次训练和一次测试，保持分层且模型无关。

Result: 实验表明，该方法性能与传统k-fold相当，但方差估计更准确，计算成本更低。

Conclusion: Irredundant k-fold交叉验证是一种高效且平衡的验证方法，适用于多种数据集和模型。

Abstract: In traditional k-fold cross-validation, each instance is used ($k-1$) times
for training and once for testing, leading to redundancy that lets many
instances disproportionately influence the learning phase. We introduce
Irredundant $k$-fold cross-validation, a novel method that guarantees each
instance is used exactly once for training and once for testing across the
entire validation procedure. This approach ensures a more balanced utilization
of the dataset, mitigates overfitting due to instance repetition, and enables
sharper distinctions in comparative model analysis. The method preserves
stratification and remains model-agnostic, i.e., compatible with any
classifier. Experimental results demonstrate that it delivers consistent
performance estimates across diverse datasets -- comparable to $k$-fold
cross-validation -- while providing less optimistic variance estimates because
training partitions are non-overlapping, and significantly reducing the overall
computational cost.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: $K^4$ 是一种无监督且不依赖解析器的日志异常检测框架，通过高效k-NN统计将日志嵌入转换为四维描述符，实现高性能在线检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有日志异常检测方法速度慢、依赖易出错的解析，且评估协议不现实。

Method: $K^4$ 使用k-NN统计将日志嵌入转换为四维描述符（精确度、召回率、密度、覆盖率），支持轻量级检测器无需重新训练即可准确评分。

Result: $K^4$ 在在线评估协议下表现优异（AUROC: 0.995-0.999），速度显著快于基线方法（训练<4秒，推理低至4μs）。

Conclusion: $K^4$ 在性能和效率上均优于现有方法，为日志异常检测提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Existing Log Anomaly Detection (LogAD) methods are often slow, dependent on
error-prone parsing, and use unrealistic evaluation protocols. We introduce
$K^4$, an unsupervised and parser-independent framework for high-performance
online detection. $K^4$ transforms arbitrary log embeddings into compact
four-dimensional descriptors (Precision, Recall, Density, Coverage) using
efficient k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) statistics. These descriptors enable
lightweight detectors to accurately score anomalies without retraining. Using a
more realistic online evaluation protocol, $K^4$ sets a new state-of-the-art
(AUROC: 0.995-0.999), outperforming baselines by large margins while being
orders of magnitude faster, with training under 4 seconds and inference as low
as 4 $\mu$s.

### [353] [What Can Grokking Teach Us About Learning Under Nonstationarity?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20057)
*Clare Lyle,Gharda Sokar,Razvan Pascanu,Andras Gyorgy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文探讨了持续学习中神经网络的特征学习动态如何影响泛化能力，并提出了一种通过调整有效学习率来促进特征学习的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续学习中，神经网络对早期数据的偏好（primacy bias）会阻碍后续任务的泛化能力。研究旨在探索特征学习动态如何帮助克服这一问题。

Method: 通过增加有效学习率（参数与更新范数的比率）来诱导特征学习动态，从而促进泛化和特征覆盖。

Result: 该方法在多种场景（如grokking、神经网络预热训练和强化学习任务）中均能促进特征学习并提升泛化性能。

Conclusion: 特征学习动态是克服持续学习中primacy bias的关键，调整有效学习率是一种简单有效的方法。

Abstract: In continual learning problems, it is often necessary to overwrite components
of a neural network's learned representation in response to changes in the data
stream; however, neural networks often exhibit \primacy bias, whereby early
training data hinders the network's ability to generalize on later tasks. While
feature-learning dynamics of nonstationary learning problems are not well
studied, the emergence of feature-learning dynamics is known to drive the
phenomenon of grokking, wherein neural networks initially memorize their
training data and only later exhibit perfect generalization. This work
conjectures that the same feature-learning dynamics which facilitate
generalization in grokking also underlie the ability to overwrite previous
learned features as well, and methods which accelerate grokking by facilitating
feature-learning dynamics are promising candidates for addressing primacy bias
in non-stationary learning problems. We then propose a straightforward method
to induce feature-learning dynamics as needed throughout training by increasing
the effective learning rate, i.e. the ratio between parameter and update norms.
We show that this approach both facilitates feature-learning and improves
generalization in a variety of settings, including grokking, warm-starting
neural network training, and reinforcement learning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 保护联邦学习中的模型隐私，防止窃听者通过模型更新推断敏感信息。

Method: 将模型学习视为参数估计问题，通过Fisher信息矩阵驱动模型更新至奇异状态；安全共享偏移量以保持模型准确性；提出收敛测试检测篡改。

Result: 数值结果显示，该方法比噪声注入方案能实现更高的模型偏移，同时需要更少的带宽秘密通道。

Conclusion: 该方法有效保护模型隐私，同时保持模型准确性，并通过收敛测试验证其安全性。

Abstract: In this paper, shifts are introduced to preserve model privacy against an
eavesdropper in federated learning. Model learning is treated as a parameter
estimation problem. This perspective allows us to derive the Fisher Information
matrix of the model updates from the shifted updates and drive them to
singularity, thus posing a hard estimation problem for Eve. The shifts are
securely shared with the central server to maintain model accuracy at the
server and participating devices. A convergence test is proposed to detect if
model updates have been tampered with and we show that our scheme passes this
test. Numerical results show that our scheme achieves a higher model shift when
compared to a noise injection scheme while requiring a lesser bandwidth secret
channel.

TL;DR: Flow Policy Optimization (FPO) 是一种基于流匹配的策略优化算法，将流模型与强化学习结合，无需精确似然计算，适用于连续控制任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将流模型的生成能力引入强化学习策略优化，解决传统高斯策略在多模态动作分布中的局限性。

Method: FPO 通过优势加权比率最大化流匹配损失，与 PPO-clip 框架兼容，无需绑定特定采样方法。

Result: FPO 在连续控制任务中表现优异，流模型能捕捉多模态动作分布，性能优于高斯策略。

Conclusion: FPO 提供了一种灵活且高效的策略优化方法，适用于复杂任务中的多模态动作建模。

Abstract: Flow-based generative models, including diffusion models, excel at modeling
continuous distributions in high-dimensional spaces. In this work, we introduce
Flow Policy Optimization (FPO), a simple on-policy reinforcement learning
algorithm that brings flow matching into the policy gradient framework. FPO
casts policy optimization as maximizing an advantage-weighted ratio computed
from the conditional flow matching loss, in a manner compatible with the
popular PPO-clip framework. It sidesteps the need for exact likelihood
computation while preserving the generative capabilities of flow-based models.
Unlike prior approaches for diffusion-based reinforcement learning that bind
training to a specific sampling method, FPO is agnostic to the choice of
diffusion or flow integration at both training and inference time. We show that
FPO can train diffusion-style policies from scratch in a variety of continuous
control tasks. We find that flow-based models can capture multimodal action
distributions and achieve higher performance than Gaussian policies,
particularly in under-conditioned settings.

*Saba Ahmadi,Avrim Blum,Haifeng Xu,Fan Yao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文探讨了社交媒体用户生成内容（UGC）的监管问题，提出通过机制设计优化言论自由与社会扭曲之间的平衡，并提供了近似最优解的实用方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体上的UGC容易受到煽动和操纵，需要有效监管，但自动化内容审核会引发用户的策略性回应，需平衡言论自由与社会扭曲。

Method: 通过机制设计优化言论自由与社会扭曲的权衡，提出近似最优解的实用方法，并提供有限离线数据量的泛化保证。

Result: 尽管最优权衡问题是NP难问题，但提出了有效的近似方法，并确定了所需离线数据量。

Conclusion: 研究为社交媒体内容审核提供了平衡言论自由与社会扭曲的实用解决方案，并量化了数据需求。

Abstract: User-generated content (UGC) on social media platforms is vulnerable to
incitements and manipulations, necessitating effective regulations. To address
these challenges, those platforms often deploy automated content moderators
tasked with evaluating the harmfulness of UGC and filtering out content that
violates established guidelines. However, such moderation inevitably gives rise
to strategic responses from users, who strive to express themselves within the
confines of guidelines. Such phenomena call for a careful balance between: 1.
ensuring freedom of speech -- by minimizing the restriction of expression; and
2. reducing social distortion -- measured by the total amount of content
manipulation. We tackle the problem of optimizing this balance through the lens
of mechanism design, aiming at optimizing the trade-off between minimizing
social distortion and maximizing free speech. Although determining the optimal
trade-off is NP-hard, we propose practical methods to approximate the optimal
solution. Additionally, we provide generalization guarantees determining the
amount of finite offline data required to approximate the optimal moderator
effectively.

*Xinyi Li,Zongyi Li,Nikola Kovachki,Anima Anandkumar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种将最优传输（OT）融入偏微分方程（PDE）算子学习的方法，通过将几何嵌入问题转化为OT问题，提升了计算效率和灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统几何学习方法通常将域表示为网格、图或点云，缺乏灵活性。本文旨在通过OT方法实现更高效的几何嵌入。

Method: 将离散网格推广为网格密度函数，通过OT问题将其映射到参考空间的均匀密度上，并基于2D参数化潜在空间进行3D表面计算。

Result: 在ShapeNet-Car、DrivAerNet-Car和FlowBench数据集上，该方法在精度和计算效率（时间和内存）上优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 基于OT的实例依赖变形方法在复杂几何数据集上表现出显著优势，为PDE算子学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: We propose integrating optimal transport (OT) into operator learning for
partial differential equations (PDEs) on complex geometries. Classical
geometric learning methods typically represent domains as meshes, graphs, or
point clouds. Our approach generalizes discretized meshes to mesh density
functions, formulating geometry embedding as an OT problem that maps these
functions to a uniform density in a reference space. Compared to previous
methods relying on interpolation or shared deformation, our OT-based method
employs instance-dependent deformation, offering enhanced flexibility and
effectiveness. For 3D simulations focused on surfaces, our OT-based neural
operator embeds the surface geometry into a 2D parameterized latent space. By
performing computations directly on this 2D representation of the surface
manifold, it achieves significant computational efficiency gains compared to
volumetric simulation. Experiments with Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes
equations (RANS) on the ShapeNet-Car and DrivAerNet-Car datasets show that our
method achieves better accuracy and also reduces computational expenses in
terms of both time and memory usage compared to existing machine learning
models. Additionally, our model demonstrates significantly improved accuracy on
the FlowBench dataset, underscoring the benefits of employing
instance-dependent deformation for datasets with highly variable geometries.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出两种方法，用于在使用数据增强时构建有效的置信区间，以改进强化学习中的离策略评估（OPE）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗等高风险领域，可靠的策略价值估计不确定性量化至关重要，现有方法缺乏对数据增强的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出两种方法：一是基于特定初始状态的条件策略性能置信区间，使用新的高维状态MDP的共形预测方法；二是利用双重稳健估计和预测驱动推理估计平均策略性能。

Result: 在多个模拟器和真实医疗数据集上验证，新方法能覆盖真实值，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 新方法为数据增强下的OPE提供了可靠的不确定性量化，适用于高风险应用。

Abstract: Off-policy evaluation (OPE) methods aim to estimate the value of a new
reinforcement learning (RL) policy prior to deployment. Recent advances have
shown that leveraging auxiliary datasets, such as those synthesized by
generative models, can improve the accuracy of these value estimates.
Unfortunately, such auxiliary datasets may also be biased, and existing methods
for using data augmentation for OPE in RL lack principled uncertainty
quantification. In high stakes settings like healthcare, reliable uncertainty
estimates are important for comparing policy value estimates. In this work, we
propose two approaches to construct valid confidence intervals for OPE when
using data augmentation. The first provides a confidence interval over the
policy performance conditioned on a particular initial state $V^{\pi}(s_0)$--
such intervals are particularly important for human-centered applications. To
do so we introduce a new conformal prediction method for high dimensional state
MDPs. Second, we consider the more common task of estimating the average policy
performance over many initial states; to do so we draw on ideas from doubly
robust estimation and prediction powered inference. Across simulators spanning
robotics, healthcare and inventory management, and a real healthcare dataset
from MIMIC-IV, we find that our methods can use augmented data and still
consistently produce intervals that cover the ground truth values, unlike
previously proposed methods.

Result: 通过模拟和脑电图数据分析，SEM表现优于基于导数的方法，并揭示了任务特异性的大脑连接模式。

Conclusion: SEM为复杂系统的动力学建模提供了更通用的工具，并在脑连接分析中展示了其潜力。

Abstract: Equation discovery is a fundamental learning task for uncovering the
underlying dynamics of complex systems, with wide-ranging applications in areas
such as brain connectivity analysis, climate modeling, gene regulation, and
physical system simulation. However, many existing approaches rely on accurate
derivative estimation and are limited to first-order dynamical systems,
restricting their applicability to real-world scenarios. In this work, we
propose sparse equation matching (SEM), a unified framework that encompasses
several existing equation discovery methods under a common formulation. SEM
introduces an integral-based sparse regression method using Green's functions,
enabling derivative-free estimation of differential operators and their
associated driving functions in general-order dynamical systems. The
effectiveness of SEM is demonstrated through extensive simulations,
benchmarking its performance against derivative-based approaches. We then apply
SEM to electroencephalographic (EEG) data recorded during multiple oculomotor
tasks, collected from 52 participants in a brain-computer interface experiment.
Our method identifies active brain regions across participants and reveals
task-specific connectivity patterns. These findings offer valuable insights
into brain connectivity and the underlying neural mechanisms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在微调预训练模型时未能充分结构化嵌入空间以反映类内语义关系，而等效代码突变检测任务对嵌入空间质量要求高。

Method: 结合交叉熵损失与Cluster Purge Loss，动态调整类内边界，优化嵌入空间。以UniXCoder为基础模型。

Result: 在等效突变检测领域达到最先进性能，并生成更可解释的嵌入空间。

Conclusion: 新框架通过优化类内语义关系，显著提升了模型在代码处理任务中的表现。

Abstract: Recent pre-trained transformer models achieve superior performance in various
code processing objectives. However, although effective at optimizing decision
boundaries, common approaches for fine-tuning them for downstream
classification tasks - distance-based methods or training an additional
classification head - often fail to thoroughly structure the embedding space to
reflect nuanced intra-class semantic relationships. Equivalent code mutant
detection is one of these tasks, where the quality of the embedding space is
crucial to the performance of the models. We introduce a novel framework that
integrates cross-entropy loss with a deep metric learning objective, termed
Cluster Purge Loss. This objective, unlike conventional approaches,
concentrates on adjusting fine-grained differences within each class,
encouraging the separation of instances based on semantical equivalency to the
class center using dynamically adjusted borders. Employing UniXCoder as the
base model, our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in the
domain of equivalent mutant detection and produces a more interpretable
embedding space.

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for learning hidden graph structures from data

Conclusion: Meta Fusion为多模态数据融合提供了统一且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Developing effective multimodal data fusion strategies has become
increasingly essential for improving the predictive power of statistical
machine learning methods across a wide range of applications, from autonomous
driving to medical diagnosis. Traditional fusion methods, including early,
intermediate, and late fusion, integrate data at different stages, each
offering distinct advantages and limitations. In this paper, we introduce Meta
Fusion, a flexible and principled framework that unifies these existing
strategies as special cases. Motivated by deep mutual learning and ensemble
learning, Meta Fusion constructs a cohort of models based on various
combinations of latent representations across modalities, and further boosts
predictive performance through soft information sharing within the cohort. Our
approach is model-agnostic in learning the latent representations, allowing it
to flexibly adapt to the unique characteristics of each modality.
Theoretically, our soft information sharing mechanism reduces the
generalization error. Empirically, Meta Fusion consistently outperforms
conventional fusion strategies in extensive simulation studies. We further
validate our approach on real-world applications, including Alzheimer's disease
detection and neural decoding.

Abstract: The Transformer, with its scaled dot-product attention mechanism, has become
a foundational architecture in modern AI. However, this mechanism is
computationally intensive and incurs substantial energy costs. We propose a new
Transformer architecture EcoTransformer, in which the output context vector is
constructed as the convolution of the values using a Laplacian kernel, where
the distances are measured by the L1 metric between the queries and keys.
Compared to dot-product based attention, the new attention score calculation is
free of matrix multiplication. It performs on par with, or even surpasses,
scaled dot-product attention in NLP, bioinformatics, and vision tasks, while
consuming significantly less energy.

Abstract: We introduce the Graded Transformer framework, a novel class of sequence
models that embeds algebraic inductive biases through grading transformations
on vector spaces. Extending the theory of Graded Neural Networks (GNNs), we
propose two architectures: the Linearly Graded Transformer (LGT) and the
Exponentially Graded Transformer (EGT). These models apply parameterized
scaling operators-governed by fixed or learnable grading tuples and, for EGT,
exponential factors to infuse hierarchical structure into attention and
representation layers, enhancing efficiency for structured data.
  We derive rigorous theoretical guarantees, including universal approximation
theorems for continuous and Sobolev functions, reduced sample complexity via
effective VC dimension bounds, Lipschitz continuity of graded operations, and
robustness to adversarial perturbations. A graded loss function ensures
gradient stability and alignment with domain priors during optimization. By
treating grades as differentiable parameters, the framework enables adaptive
feature prioritization, overcoming limitations of fixed grades in prior work.
  The Graded Transformer holds transformative potential for hierarchical
learning and neurosymbolic reasoning, with applications spanning algebraic
geometry (e.g., moduli spaces and zeta functions), physics (e.g., multiscale
simulations), natural language processing (e.g., syntactic parsing), biological
sequence analysis (e.g., variant prediction), and emerging areas like graph
neural networks and financial modeling. This work advances structured deep
learning by fusing geometric and algebraic principles with attention
mechanisms, offering a mathematically grounded alternative to data-driven
models and paving the way for interpretable, efficient systems in complex
domains.

probing-augmented user-centric selection (PUCS) framework, where a learner
first probes a subset of arms to obtain side information on resources and
rewards, and then assigns $K$ plays to $M$ arms. PUCS covers applications such
as ridesharing, wireless scheduling, and content recommendation, in which both
resources and payoffs are initially unknown and probing is costly. For the
offline setting with known distributions, we present a greedy probing algorithm
with a constant-factor approximation guarantee $\zeta = (e-1)/(2e-1)$. For the
online setting with unknown distributions, we introduce OLPA, a stochastic
combinatorial bandit algorithm that achieves a regret bound
$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T} + \ln^{2} T)$. We also prove a lower bound
$\Omega(\sqrt{T})$, showing that the upper bound is tight up to logarithmic
factors. Experiments on real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of our
solutions.

Motivation: 改进传统葡萄酒分析方法，结合光谱技术和机器学习，简化酿酒过程中的感官数据和产地分类问题。

Method: 结合紫外-可见光谱和机器学习技术，分两阶段应用于酿酒过程，利用光谱指纹技术和AI。

Result: SVM在属性和产地预测任务中表现最优，准确率和F1分数均超过91%，关键波长范围为250-420 nm。

Conclusion: 该研究为葡萄酒行业整合大数据和物联网提供了新思路，推动了‘智能酒庄’的发展。

Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to use absorbance data obtained by human tasting
and an ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) scanning spectrophotometer to predict the
attributes of grape juice (GJ) and to classify the wine's origin, respectively.
The approach combined machine learning (ML) techniques with spectroscopy to
find a relatively simple way to apply them in two stages of winemaking and help
improve the traditional wine analysis methods regarding sensory data and wine's
origins. This new technique has overcome the disadvantages of the complex
sensors by taking advantage of spectral fingerprinting technology and forming a
comprehensive study of the employment of AI in the wine analysis domain. In the
results, Support Vector Machine (SVM) was the most efficient and robust in both
attributes and origin prediction tasks. Both the accuracy and F1 score of the
origin prediction exceed 91%. The feature ranking approach found that the more
influential wavelengths usually appear at the lower end of the scan range, 250
nm (nanometers) to 420 nm, which is believed to be of great help for selecting
appropriate validation methods and sensors to extract wine data in future
research. The knowledge of this research provides new ideas and early solutions
for the wine industry or other beverage industries to integrate big data and
IoT in the future, which significantly promotes the development of 'Smart
Wineries'.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AMLP是一种无监督框架，通过使MLP适应聚合而非直接设计聚合函数，解决了GNN中固定聚合函数在异质性下性能不佳的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs通常采用固定的聚合函数（如Mean、Max、Sum），缺乏理论依据，尤其在异质性下表现不佳。现有方法依赖大量标注数据，而现实任务中标注数据稀缺。

Method: 提出AMLP框架，包括两个关键步骤：1）利用图重构方法实现高阶分组效果；2）使用单层网络编码异质性程度。

Result: 在节点聚类和分类任务中，AMLP表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: AMLP为多样化的图学习场景提供了潜力，解决了GNN中聚合函数的局限性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become a dominant approach to learning
graph representations, primarily because of their message-passing mechanisms.
However, GNNs typically adopt a fixed aggregator function such as Mean, Max, or
Sum without principled reasoning behind the selection. This rigidity,
especially in the presence of heterophily, often leads to poor, problem
dependent performance. Although some attempts address this by designing more
sophisticated aggregation functions, these methods tend to rely heavily on
labeled data, which is often scarce in real-world tasks. In this work, we
propose a novel unsupervised framework, "Aggregation-aware Multilayer
Perceptron" (AMLP), which shifts the paradigm from directly crafting
aggregation functions to making MLP adaptive to aggregation. Our lightweight
approach consists of two key steps: First, we utilize a graph reconstruction
method that facilitates high-order grouping effects, and second, we employ a
single-layer network to encode varying degrees of heterophily, thereby
improving the capacity and applicability of the model. Extensive experiments on
node clustering and classification demonstrate the superior performance of
AMLP, highlighting its potential for diverse graph learning scenarios.

Conclusion: MEVO是一个高效且数据利用率高的通用框架，适用于结构配体设计的多种任务。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models, particularly diffusion and
auto-regressive models, have revolutionized fields like computer vision and
natural language processing. However, their application to structure-based drug
design (SBDD) remains limited due to critical data constraints. To address the
limitation of training data for models targeting SBDD tasks, we propose an
evolutionary framework named MEVO, which bridges the gap between billion-scale
small molecule dataset and the scarce protein-ligand complex dataset, and
effectively increase the abundance of training data for generative SBDD models.
MEVO is composed of three key components: a high-fidelity VQ-VAE for molecule
representation in latent space, a diffusion model for pharmacophore-guided
molecule generation, and a pocket-aware evolutionary strategy for molecule
optimization with physics-based scoring function. This framework efficiently
generate high-affinity binders for various protein targets, validated with
predicted binding affinities using free energy perturbation (FEP) methods. In
addition, we showcase the capability of MEVO in designing potent inhibitors to
KRAS$^{\textrm{G12D}}$, a challenging target in cancer therapeutics, with
similar affinity to the known highly active inhibitor evaluated by FEP
calculations. With high versatility and generalizability, MEVO offers an
effective and data-efficient model for various tasks in structure-based ligand
design.

Result: ASNN在2层和3层网络中成功提出优于原始数据的架构，提升平均测试准确率。

Conclusion: ASNN为神经网络架构优化提供高效替代方案，有望自动化设计过程。

Abstract: The architecture of a neural network (NN) plays a critical role in
determining its performance. However, there is no general closed-form function
that maps between network structure and accuracy, making the process of
architecture design largely heuristic or search-based. In this study, we
propose the Architecture Suggesting Neural Network (ASNN), a model designed to
learn the relationship between NN architecture and its test accuracy, and to
suggest improved architectures accordingly. To train ASNN, we constructed
datasets using TensorFlow-based models with varying numbers of layers and
nodes. Experimental results were collected for both 2-layer and 3-layer
architectures across a grid of configurations, each evaluated with 10 repeated
trials to account for stochasticity. Accuracy values were treated as inputs,
and architectural parameters as outputs. The trained ASNN was then used
iteratively to predict architectures that yield higher performance. In both
2-layer and 3-layer cases, ASNN successfully suggested architectures that
outperformed the best results found in the original training data. Repeated
prediction and retraining cycles led to the discovery of architectures with
improved mean test accuracies, demonstrating the model's capacity to generalize
the performance-structure relationship. These results suggest that ASNN
provides an efficient alternative to random search for architecture
optimization, and offers a promising approach toward automating neural network
design. "Parts of the manuscript, including text editing and expression

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于重要性采样的偏移校正方法（IS²C），用于解决部分域适应（PDA）中的标签分布偏移问题，并通过理论证明和实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 部分域适应（PDA）中，源域和目标域的标签分布存在偏移，简单的样本加权方法无法充分利用标记数据，容易导致模型在源域上过拟合。

Method: 提出IS²C方法，通过从构建的采样域中采样新标记数据来校正标签分布偏移，并结合最优传输理论进行条件分布对齐。

Result: 理论证明IS²C能有效控制泛化误差，实验结果表明其在PDA基准上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: IS²C方法在解决PDA问题时表现出色，为标签分布偏移提供了可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Partial domain adaptation (PDA) is a challenging task in real-world machine
learning scenarios. It aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source domain
to a related unlabeled target domain, where the support set of the source label
distribution subsumes the target one. Previous PDA works managed to correct the
label distribution shift by weighting samples in the source domain. However,
the simple reweighing technique cannot explore the latent structure and
sufficiently use the labeled data, and then models are prone to over-fitting on
the source domain. In this work, we propose a novel importance sampling-based
shift correction (IS$^2$C) method, where new labeled data are sampled from a
built sampling domain, whose label distribution is supposed to be the same as
the target domain, to characterize the latent structure and enhance the
generalization ability of the model. We provide theoretical guarantees for
IS$^2$C by proving that the generalization error can be sufficiently dominated
by IS$^2$C. In particular, by implementing sampling with the mixture
distribution, the extent of shift between source and sampling domains can be
connected to generalization error, which provides an interpretable way to build
IS$^2$C. To improve knowledge transfer, an optimal transport-based independence
criterion is proposed for conditional distribution alignment, where the
computation of the criterion can be adjusted to reduce the complexity from
$\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ to $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ in realistic PDA scenarios. Extensive
experiments on PDA benchmarks validate the theoretical results and demonstrate
the effectiveness of our IS$^2$C over existing methods.

Conclusion: TINs为技术分析提供了现代AI支持，推动了算法交易的进步。

Abstract: This work proposes that a vast majority of classical technical indicators in
financial analysis are, in essence, special cases of neural networks with fixed

moving averages, momentum-based oscillators, volatility bands, and other
commonly used technical constructs, can be reconstructed topologically as
modular neural network components. Technical Indicator Networks (TINs) are
introduced as a general neural architecture that replicates and structurally
upgrades traditional indicators by supporting n-dimensional inputs such as
price, volume, sentiment, and order book data. By encoding domain-specific
knowledge into neural structures, TINs modernize the foundational logic of
technical analysis and propel algorithmic trading into a new era, bridging the
legacy of proven indicators with the potential of contemporary AI systems.

Conclusion: Protein-SE(3)为SE(3)蛋白质结构生成提供了标准化评估工具，促进未来算法开发。

Abstract: SE(3)-based generative models have shown great promise in protein geometry
modeling and effective structure design. However, the field currently lacks a
modularized benchmark to enable comprehensive investigation and fair comparison
of different methods. In this paper, we propose Protein-SE(3), a new benchmark
based on a unified training framework, which comprises protein scaffolding
tasks, integrated generative models, high-level mathematical abstraction, and
diverse evaluation metrics. Recent advanced generative models designed for
protein scaffolding, from multiple perspectives like DDPM (Genie1 and Genie2),
Score Matching (FrameDiff and RfDiffusion) and Flow Matching (FoldFlow and
FrameFlow) are integrated into our framework. All integrated methods are fairly
investigated with the same training dataset and evaluation metrics.
Furthermore, we provide a high-level abstraction of the mathematical
foundations behind the generative models, enabling fast prototyping of future
algorithms without reliance on explicit protein structures. Accordingly, we
release the first comprehensive benchmark built upon unified training framework
for SE(3)-based protein structure design, which is publicly accessible at

Motivation: 现有方法在挖掘公式化阿尔法因子时因稀疏奖励而效率低下，限制了符号搜索空间的探索并导致训练不稳定。

Result: 在六大中美股票指数上的实验表明，TLRS显著提升了挖掘因子的预测能力，Rank Information Coefficient提高了9.29%，计算效率大幅提升。

Conclusion: TLRS通过改进奖励机制，有效解决了稀疏奖励问题，提升了强化学习在金融领域的应用效果。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has successfully automated the complex process of
mining formulaic alpha factors, for creating interpretable and profitable
investment strategies. However, existing methods are hampered by the sparse
rewards given the underlying Markov Decision Process. This inefficiency limits
the exploration of the vast symbolic search space and destabilizes the training
process. To address this, Trajectory-level Reward Shaping (TLRS), a novel
reward shaping method, is proposed. TLRS provides dense, intermediate rewards
by measuring the subsequence-level similarity between partially generated
expressions and a set of expert-designed formulas. Furthermore, a reward
centering mechanism is introduced to reduce training variance. Extensive
experiments on six major Chinese and U.S. stock indices show that TLRS
significantly improves the predictive power of mined factors, boosting the Rank
Information Coefficient by 9.29% over existing potential-based shaping
algorithms. Notably, TLRS achieves a major leap in computational efficiency by
reducing its time complexity with respect to the feature dimension from linear
to constant, which is a significant improvement over distance-based baselines.

Conclusion: 该方法能够高效利用有限数据，为AI决策提供严格的覆盖保证。

Abstract: Calibration data are necessary to formally quantify the uncertainty of the
decisions produced by an existing artificial intelligence (AI) model. To
overcome the common issue of scarce calibration data, a promising approach is
to employ synthetic labels produced by a (generally different) predictive
model. However, fine-tuning the label-generating predictor on the inference
task of interest, as well as estimating the residual bias of the synthetic
labels, demand additional data, potentially exacerbating the calibration data
scarcity problem. This paper introduces a novel approach that efficiently
utilizes limited calibration data to simultaneously fine-tune a predictor and
estimate the bias of the synthetic labels. The proposed method yields
prediction sets with rigorous coverage guarantees for AI-generated decisions.
Experimental results on an indoor localization problem validate the
effectiveness and performance gains of our solution.

Conclusion: 该方法为神经网络回归器提供了一种高效且无需保留数据的后处理不确定性量化方案，优于传统方法。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification is an important prerequisite for the deployment of
deep learning models in safety-critical areas. Yet, this hinges on the
uncertainty estimates being useful to the extent the prediction intervals are
well-calibrated and sharp. In the absence of inherent uncertainty estimates
(e.g. pretrained models predicting only point estimates), popular approaches
that operate post-hoc include Laplace's method and split conformal prediction
(split-CP). However, Laplace's method can be miscalibrated when the model is
misspecified and split-CP requires sample splitting, and thus comes at the
expense of statistical efficiency. In this work, we construct prediction
intervals for neural network regressors post-hoc without held-out data. This is
achieved by approximating the full conformal prediction method (full-CP).
Whilst full-CP nominally requires retraining the model for every test point and
candidate label, we propose to train just once and locally perturb model
parameters using Gauss-Newton influence to approximate the effect of
retraining. Coupled with linearization of the network, we express the absolute
residual nonconformity score as a piecewise linear function of the candidate
label allowing for an efficient procedure that avoids the exhaustive search
over the output space. On standard regression benchmarks and bounding box
localization, we show the resulting prediction intervals are locally-adaptive
and often tighter than those of split-CP.

Result: 在八种聚合物性能预测任务中，MIPS达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: MIPS通过整合拓扑和空间信息，克服了现有方法的局限性，为聚合物性能预测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Polymers, composed of repeating structural units called monomers, are
fundamental materials in daily life and industry. Accurate property prediction
for polymers is essential for their design, development, and application.
However, existing modeling approaches, which typically represent polymers by
the constituent monomers, struggle to capture the whole properties of polymer,
since the properties change during the polymerization process. In this study,
we propose a Multimodal Infinite Polymer Sequence (MIPS) pre-training
framework, which represents polymers as infinite sequences of monomers and
integrates both topological and spatial information for comprehensive modeling.
From the topological perspective, we generalize message passing mechanism (MPM)
and graph attention mechanism (GAM) to infinite polymer sequences. For MPM, we
demonstrate that applying MPM to infinite polymer sequences is equivalent to
applying MPM on the induced star-linking graph of monomers. For GAM, we propose
to further replace global graph attention with localized graph attention (LGA).
Moreover, we show the robustness of the "star linking" strategy through Repeat
and Shift Invariance Test (RSIT). Despite its robustness, "star linking"
strategy exhibits limitations when monomer side chains contain ring structures,
a common characteristic of polymers, as it fails the Weisfeiler-Lehman~(WL)
test. To overcome this issue, we propose backbone embedding to enhance the
capability of MPM and LGA on infinite polymer sequences. From the spatial
perspective, we extract 3D descriptors of repeating monomers to capture spatial
information. Finally, we design a cross-modal fusion mechanism to unify the
topological and spatial information. Experimental validation across eight
diverse polymer property prediction tasks reveals that MIPS achieves
state-of-the-art performance.

Result: 微调后的模型在教学原则的三个维度上表现显著提升。

Conclusion: EduAlign为开发更符合教学需求的AI导师提供了可扩展的方法。

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into education presents
unprecedented opportunities for scalable personalized learning. However,
standard LLMs often function as generic information providers, lacking
alignment with fundamental pedagogical principles such as helpfulness,
student-centered personalization, and creativity cultivation. To bridge this
gap, we propose EduAlign, a novel framework designed to guide LLMs toward
becoming more effective and responsible educational assistants. EduAlign
consists of two main stages. In the first stage, we curate a dataset of 8k
educational interactions and annotate them-both manually and
automatically-along three key educational dimensions: Helpfulness,
Personalization, and Creativity (HPC). These annotations are used to train
HPC-RM, a multi-dimensional reward model capable of accurately scoring LLM
outputs according to these educational principles. We further evaluate the
consistency and reliability of this reward model. In the second stage, we
leverage HPC-RM as a reward signal to fine-tune a pre-trained LLM using Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on a set of 2k diverse prompts. We then
assess the pre- and post-finetuning models on both educational and
general-domain benchmarks across the three HPC dimensions. Experimental results
demonstrate that the fine-tuned model exhibits significantly improved alignment
with pedagogical helpfulness, personalization, and creativity stimulation. This
study presents a scalable and effective approach to aligning LLMs with nuanced
and desirable educational traits, paving the way for the development of more
engaging, pedagogically aligned AI tutors.

Abstract: Causal discovery from observational data is challenging, especially with
large datasets and complex relationships. Traditional methods often struggle
with scalability and capturing global structural information. To overcome these
limitations, we introduce a novel graph neural network (GNN)-based
probabilistic framework that learns a probability distribution over the entire
space of causal graphs, unlike methods that output a single deterministic
graph. Our framework leverages a GNN that encodes both node and edge attributes
into a unified graph representation, enabling the model to learn complex causal
structures directly from data. The GNN model is trained on a diverse set of
synthetic datasets augmented with statistical and information-theoretic
measures, such as mutual information and conditional entropy, capturing both
local and global data properties. We frame causal discovery as a supervised
learning problem, directly predicting the entire graph structure. Our approach
demonstrates superior performance, outperforming both traditional and recent
non-GNN-based methods, as well as a GNN-based approach, in terms of accuracy
and scalability on synthetic and real-world datasets without further training.
This probabilistic framework significantly improves causal structure learning,
with broad implications for decision-making and scientific discovery across
various fields.

Abstract: Multi-grade deep learning (MGDL) has been shown to significantly outperform
the standard single-grade deep learning (SGDL) across various applications.
This work aims to investigate the computational advantages of MGDL focusing on
its performance in image regression, denoising, and deblurring tasks, and

analyze the eigenvalue distributions of the Jacobian matrices associated with
the iterative schemes arising from the GD iterations, offering an explanation
for MGDL's enhanced training stability.

Abstract: Identifying upstream processes responsible for wafer defects is challenging
due to the combinatorial nature of process flows and the inherent variability
in processing routes, which arises from factors such as rework operations and
random process waiting times. This paper presents a novel framework for wafer
defect root cause analysis, called Partial Trajectory Regression (PTR). The
proposed framework is carefully designed to address the limitations of
conventional vector-based regression models, particularly in handling
variable-length processing routes that span a large number of heterogeneous
physical processes. To compute the attribution score of each process given a
detected high defect density on a specific wafer, we propose a new algorithm
that compares two counterfactual outcomes derived from partial process
trajectories. This is enabled by new representation learning methods, proc2vec
and route2vec. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework using
real wafer history data from the NY CREATES fab in Albany.

Conclusion: MH-GIN通过捕捉多尺度依赖关系显著提升了填补精度，代码已开源。

Abstract: Location-tracking data from the Automatic Identification System, much of
which is publicly available, plays a key role in a range of maritime safety and
monitoring applications. However, the data suffers from missing values that
hamper downstream applications. Imputing the missing values is challenging
because the values of different heterogeneous attributes are updated at diverse
rates, resulting in the occurrence of multi-scale dependencies among
attributes. Existing imputation methods that assume similar update rates across
attributes are unable to capture and exploit such dependencies, limiting their
imputation accuracy. We propose MH-GIN, a Multi-scale Heterogeneous Graph-based
Imputation Network that aims improve imputation accuracy by capturing
multi-scale dependencies. Specifically, MH-GIN first extracts multi-scale
temporal features for each attribute while preserving their intrinsic
heterogeneous characteristics. Then, it constructs a multi-scale heterogeneous
graph to explicitly model dependencies between heterogeneous attributes to
enable more accurate imputation of missing values through graph propagation.
Experimental results on two real-world datasets find that MH-GIN is capable of
an average 57% reduction in imputation errors compared to state-of-the-art
methods, while maintaining computational efficiency. The source code and
implementation details of MH-GIN are publicly available

Abstract: How can we identify problematic upstream processes when a certain type of
wafer defect starts appearing at a quality checkpoint? Given the complexity of
modern semiconductor manufacturing, which involves thousands of process steps,
cross-process root cause analysis for wafer defects has been considered highly
challenging. This paper proposes a novel framework called Trajectory Shapley
Attribution (TSA), an extension of Shapley values (SV), a widely used
attribution algorithm in explainable artificial intelligence research. TSA
overcomes key limitations of standard SV, including its disregard for the
sequential nature of manufacturing processes and its reliance on an arbitrarily
chosen reference point. We applied TSA to a good-bad wafer diagnosis task in
experimental front-end-of-line processes at the NY CREATES Albany NanoTech fab,
aiming to identify measurement items (serving as proxies for process
parameters) most relevant to abnormal defect occurrence.

Abstract: Clustering is a core task in machine learning with wide-ranging applications
in data mining and pattern recognition. However, its unsupervised nature makes
it inherently challenging. Many existing clustering algorithms suffer from
critical limitations: they often require careful parameter tuning, exhibit high
computational complexity, lack interpretability, or yield suboptimal accuracy,
especially when applied to large-scale datasets. In this paper, we introduce a
novel clustering approach based on meta-learning. Our approach eliminates the
need for parameter optimization while achieving accuracy that outperforms
state-of-the-art clustering techniques. The proposed technique leverages a few
pre-clustered samples to guide the clustering process for the entire dataset in
a single forward pass. Specifically, we employ a pre-trained Prior-Data Fitted
Transformer Network (PFN) to perform clustering. The algorithm computes
attention between the pre-clustered samples and the unclustered samples,
allowing it to infer cluster assignments for the entire dataset based on the
learned relation. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that, given just
a few pre-clustered examples, the model can generalize to accurately cluster
the rest of the dataset. Experiments on challenging benchmark datasets show
that our approach can successfully cluster well-separated data without any
pre-clustered samples, and significantly improves performance when a few
clustered samples are provided. We show that our approach is superior to the
state-of-the-art techniques. These results highlight the effectiveness and
scalability of our approach, positioning it as a promising alternative to
existing clustering techniques.

Result: 在真实网络数据测试中，WBHT的F1分数提升1.65%至58.76%，优于现有模型。

Conclusion: WBHT高效且能检测未发现的异常，适用于关键网络的主动监控和安全防护。

Abstract: We propose the Wasserstein Black Hole Transformer (WBHT) framework for
detecting black hole (BH) anomalies in communication networks. These anomalies
cause packet loss without failure notifications, disrupting connectivity and
leading to financial losses. WBHT combines generative modeling, sequential
learning, and attention mechanisms to improve BH anomaly detection. It
integrates a Wasserstein generative adversarial network with attention
mechanisms for stable training and accurate anomaly identification. The model
uses long-short-term memory layers to capture long-term dependencies and
convolutional layers for local temporal patterns. A latent space encoding
mechanism helps distinguish abnormal network behavior. Tested on real-world
network data, WBHT outperforms existing models, achieving significant
improvements in F1 score (ranging from 1.65% to 58.76%). Its efficiency and
ability to detect previously undetected anomalies make it a valuable tool for
proactive network monitoring and security, especially in mission-critical
networks.

Result: 实验表明DPPF在通信效率和泛化性能上优于其他方法，并能找到更平坦的最小值。理论分析证明了其自稳定性和收敛性。

Conclusion: DPPF算法通过推拉动态有效平衡了通信效率和模型性能，同时提供了理论保证。

Abstract: We study centralized distributed data parallel training of deep neural
networks (DNNs), aiming to improve the trade-off between communication
efficiency and model performance of the local gradient methods. To this end, we
revisit the flat-minima hypothesis, which suggests that models with better
generalization tend to lie in flatter regions of the loss landscape. We
introduce a simple, yet effective, sharpness measure, Inverse Mean Valley, and
demonstrate its strong correlation with the generalization gap of DNNs. We
incorporate an efficient relaxation of this measure into the distributed
training objective as a lightweight regularizer that encourages workers to
collaboratively seek wide minima. The regularizer exerts a pushing force that
counteracts the consensus step pulling the workers together, giving rise to the
Distributed Pull-Push Force (DPPF) algorithm. Empirically, we show that DPPF
outperforms other communication-efficient approaches and achieves better
generalization performance than local gradient methods and synchronous gradient
averaging, while significantly reducing communication overhead. In addition,
our loss landscape visualizations confirm the ability of DPPF to locate flatter
minima. On the theoretical side, we show that DPPF guides workers to span flat
valleys, with the final valley width governed by the interplay between push and
pull strengths, and that its pull-push dynamics is self-stabilizing. We further
provide generalization guarantees linked to the valley width and prove
convergence in the non-convex setting.

Conclusion: ResCap-DBP结合全局蛋白质表示和先进深度学习架构，实现了可靠且可扩展的DBP预测。

Abstract: DNA-binding proteins (DBPs) are integral to gene regulation and cellular
processes, making their accurate identification essential for understanding
biological functions and disease mechanisms. Experimental methods for DBP
identification are time-consuming and costly, driving the need for efficient
computational prediction techniques. In this study, we propose a novel deep
learning framework, ResCap-DBP, that combines a residual learning-based encoder
with a one-dimensional Capsule Network (1D-CapsNet) to predict DBPs directly
from raw protein sequences. Our architecture incorporates dilated convolutions
within residual blocks to mitigate vanishing gradient issues and extract rich
sequence features, while capsule layers with dynamic routing capture
hierarchical and spatial relationships within the learned feature space. We
conducted comprehensive ablation studies comparing global and local embeddings
from ProteinBERT and conventional one-hot encoding. Results show that
ProteinBERT embeddings substantially outperform other representations on large
datasets. Although one-hot encoding showed marginal advantages on smaller
datasets, such as PDB186, it struggled to scale effectively. Extensive
evaluations on four pairs of publicly available benchmark datasets demonstrate
that our model consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. It
achieved AUC scores of 98.0% and 89.5% on PDB14189andPDB1075, respectively. On
independent test sets PDB2272 and PDB186, the model attained top AUCs of 83.2%
and 83.3%, while maintaining competitive performance on larger datasets such as
PDB20000. Notably, the model maintains a well balanced sensitivity and
specificity across datasets. These results demonstrate the efficacy and
generalizability of integrating global protein representations with advanced
deep learning architectures for reliable and scalable DBP prediction in diverse
genomic contexts.

Conclusion: 嵌入驱动的任务相似性估计具有潜力，可提升迁移学习效率。

Abstract: Transfer Learning (TL) offers the potential to accelerate learning by
transferring knowledge across tasks. However, it faces critical challenges such
as negative transfer, domain adaptation and inefficiency in selecting solid
source policies. These issues often represent critical problems in evolving
domains, i.e. game development, where scenarios transform and agents must
adapt. The continuous release of new agents is costly and inefficient. In this
work we challenge the key issues in TL to improve knowledge transfer, agents
performance across tasks and reduce computational costs. The proposed
methodology, called FAST - Framework for Adaptive Similarity-based Transfer,
leverages visual frames and textual descriptions to create a latent
representation of tasks dynamics, that is exploited to estimate similarity
between environments. The similarity scores guides our method in choosing
candidate policies from which transfer abilities to simplify learning of novel
tasks. Experimental results, over multiple racing tracks, demonstrate that FAST
achieves competitive final performance compared to learning-from-scratch
methods while requiring significantly less training steps. These findings
highlight the potential of embedding-driven task similarity estimations.

Abstract: Multi-omics data offer unprecedented insights into complex biological
systems, yet their high dimensionality, sparsity, and intricate interactions
pose significant analytical challenges. Network-based approaches have advanced
multi-omics research by effectively capturing biologically relevant
relationships among molecular entities. While these methods are powerful for
representing molecular interactions, there remains a need for tools
specifically designed to effectively utilize these network representations
across diverse downstream analyses. To fulfill this need, we introduce
BioNeuralNet, a flexible and modular Python framework tailored for end-to-end
network-based multi-omics data analysis. BioNeuralNet leverages Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) to learn biologically meaningful low-dimensional
representations from multi-omics networks, converting these complex molecular
networks into versatile embeddings. BioNeuralNet supports all major stages of
multi-omics network analysis, including several network construction
techniques, generation of low-dimensional representations, and a broad range of
downstream analytical tasks. Its extensive utilities, including diverse GNN
architectures, and compatibility with established Python packages (e.g.,
scikit-learn, PyTorch, NetworkX), enhance usability and facilitate quick
adoption. BioNeuralNet is an open-source, user-friendly, and extensively
documented framework designed to support flexible and reproducible multi-omics
network analysis in precision medicine.

Result: 发现Lipschitz常数是影响收敛的关键因素，并针对不同L值推导了预测误差的时间界限。

Conclusion: Transformer在复杂任务中仍能有效实现ICL，注意力机制会聚焦于相关特征。

Abstract: The transformer architecture, which processes sequences of input tokens to
produce outputs for query tokens, has revolutionized numerous areas of machine
learning. A defining feature of transformers is their ability to perform
previously unseen tasks using task-specific prompts without updating
parameters, a phenomenon known as in-context learning (ICL). Recent research
has actively explored the training dynamics behind ICL, with much of the focus
on relatively simple tasks such as linear regression and binary classification.
To advance the theoretical understanding of ICL, this paper investigates more
complex nonlinear regression tasks, aiming to uncover how transformers acquire
in-context learning capabilities in these settings. We analyze the stage-wise
dynamics of attention during training: attention scores between a query token
and its target features grow rapidly in the early phase, then gradually
converge to one, while attention to irrelevant features decays more slowly and
exhibits oscillatory behavior. Our analysis introduces new proof techniques
that explicitly characterize how the nature of general non-degenerate
L-Lipschitz task functions affects attention weights. Specifically, we identify
that the Lipschitz constant L of nonlinear function classes as a key factor
governing the convergence dynamics of transformers in ICL. Leveraging these
insights, for two distinct regimes depending on whether L is below or above a
threshold, we derive different time bounds to guarantee near-zero prediction
error. Notably, despite the convergence time depending on the underlying task
functions, we prove that query tokens consistently attend to prompt tokens with
highly relevant features at convergence, demonstrating the ICL capability of
transformers for unseen functions.

Conclusion: BOASF为自动化机器学习提供了一种高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: Machine learning has been making great success in many application areas.
However, for the non-expert practitioners, it is always very challenging to
address a machine learning task successfully and efficiently. Finding the
optimal machine learning model or the hyperparameter combination set from a
large number of possible alternatives usually requires considerable expert
knowledge and experience. To tackle this problem, we propose a combined
Bayesian Optimization and Adaptive Successive Filtering algorithm (BOASF) under
a unified multi-armed bandit framework to automate the model selection or the
hyperparameter optimization. Specifically, BOASF consists of multiple
evaluation rounds in each of which we select promising configurations for each
arm using the Bayesian optimization. Then, ASF can early discard the
poor-performed arms adaptively using a Gaussian UCB-based probabilistic model.
Furthermore, a Softmax model is employed to adaptively allocate available
resources for each promising arm that advances to the next round. The arm with
a higher probability of advancing will be allocated more resources.
Experimental results show that BOASF is effective for speeding up the model
selection and hyperparameter optimization processes while achieving robust and
better prediction performance than the existing state-of-the-art automatic
machine learning methods. Moreover, BOASF achieves better anytime performance
under various time budgets.

Result: 在信号和图像去噪任务中，WEEP表现优于L1范数和其他非凸稀疏正则化方法。

Conclusion: WEEP解决了统计性能与计算可行性之间的冲突，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Sparse regularization is fundamental in signal processing for efficient
signal recovery and feature extraction. However, it faces a fundamental
dilemma: the most powerful sparsity-inducing penalties are often
non-differentiable, conflicting with gradient-based optimizers that dominate
the field. We introduce WEEP (Weakly-convex Envelope of Piecewise Penalty), a
novel, fully differentiable sparse regularizer derived from the weakly-convex
envelope framework. WEEP provides strong, unbiased sparsity while maintaining
full differentiability and L-smoothness, making it natively compatible with any
gradient-based optimizer. This resolves the conflict between statistical
performance and computational tractability. We demonstrate superior performance
compared to the L1-norm and other established non-convex sparse regularizers on
challenging signal and image denoising tasks.

Result: 数值研究表明，DGMM在估计误差和运行时间上均优于MM和GMM。

Conclusion: DGMM在统计效率、计算复杂度和数值稳定性之间取得了平衡，适用于高维数据建模。

Abstract: Since Pearson [Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. A,
185 (1894), pp. 71-110] first applied the method of moments (MM) for modeling
data as a mixture of one-dimensional Gaussians, moment-based estimation methods
have proliferated. Among these methods, the generalized method of moments (GMM)
improves the statistical efficiency of MM by weighting the moments
appropriately. However, the computational complexity and storage complexity of
MM and GMM grow exponentially with the dimension, making these methods
impractical for high-dimensional data or when higher-order moments are
required. Such computational bottlenecks are more severe in GMM since it
additionally requires estimating a large weighting matrix. To overcome these
bottlenecks, we propose the diagonally-weighted GMM (DGMM), which achieves a
balance among statistical efficiency, computational complexity, and numerical
stability. We apply DGMM to study the parameter estimation problem for weakly
separated heteroscedastic low-rank Gaussian mixtures and design a
computationally efficient and numerically stable algorithm that obtains the
DGMM estimator without explicitly computing or storing the moment tensors. We
implement the proposed algorithm and empirically validate the advantages of
DGMM: in numerical studies, DGMM attains smaller estimation errors while
requiring substantially shorter runtime than MM and GMM. The code and data will
be available upon publication at https://github.com/liu-lzhang/dgmm.

Result: 该方法在保持预测性能的同时显著降低图复杂度，提升GNN推理效率和可解释性。

Conclusion: 基于Shapley值的图稀疏化方法优于传统方法，为GNN的高效推理和可解释性提供了新思路。

Abstract: Graph sparsification is a key technique for improving inference efficiency in
Graph Neural Networks by removing edges with minimal impact on predictions. GNN
explainability methods generate local importance scores, which can be
aggregated into global scores for graph sparsification. However, many
explainability methods produce only non-negative scores, limiting their
applicability for sparsification. In contrast, Shapley value based methods
assign both positive and negative contributions to node predictions, offering a
theoretically robust and fair allocation of importance by evaluating many
subsets of graphs. Unlike gradient-based or perturbation-based explainers,
Shapley values enable better pruning strategies that preserve influential edges
while removing misleading or adversarial connections. Our approach shows that
Shapley value-based graph sparsification maintains predictive performance while
significantly reducing graph complexity, enhancing both interpretability and
efficiency in GNN inference.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于条件扩散模型的机器学习方法，用于填补卫星降水数据中的缺失区域，生成更时空一致的降水图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卫星降水数据（如GSMaP）因轨道特性存在大量缺失区域，现有插值方法常导致空间不连续。

Method: 将降水图填补任务视为视频修复问题，采用3D U-Net和3D条件编码器，结合红外图像、经纬度网格和物理时间输入。

Conclusion: 条件扩散模型有望提升全球降水监测能力。

Abstract: Incomplete satellite-based precipitation presents a significant challenge in
global monitoring. For example, the Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation
(GSMaP) from JAXA suffers from substantial missing regions due to the orbital
characteristics of satellites that have microwave sensors, and its current
interpolation methods often result in spatial discontinuities. In this study,
we formulate the completion of the precipitation map as a video inpainting task
and propose a machine learning approach based on conditional diffusion models.
Our method employs a 3D U-Net with a 3D condition encoder to reconstruct
complete precipitation maps by leveraging spatio-temporal information from
infrared images, latitude-longitude grids, and physical time inputs. Training
was carried out on ERA5 hourly precipitation data from 2020 to 2023. We
generated a pseudo-GSMaP dataset by randomly applying GSMaP masks to ERA maps.
Performance was evaluated for the calendar year 2024, and our approach produces
more spatio-temporally consistent inpainted precipitation maps compared to
conventional methods. These results indicate the potential to improve global
precipitation monitoring using the conditional diffusion models.

### [398] [HIAL: A New Paradigm for Hypergraph Active Learning via Influence Maximization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20490)
*Yanheng Hou,Xunkai Li,Zhenjun Li,Bing Zhou,Ronghua Li,Guoren Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HIAL是一种专为超图设计的主动学习框架，通过将超图主动学习问题重新定义为影响力最大化任务，结合双视角影响力函数和HOI-Aware传播机制，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图主动学习方法在超图中应用时破坏高阶结构信息，导致性能不佳，因此需要一种原生超图主动学习框架。

Method: HIAL将超图主动学习问题重新定义为影响力最大化任务，提出双视角影响力函数（MoI和EDV）和HOI-Aware传播机制，并证明其目标函数具有单调性和子模性。

Result: 在七个公开数据集上的实验表明，HIAL在性能、效率、通用性和鲁棒性上显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: HIAL为超图主动学习提供了一种高效且强大的新范式。

Abstract: In recent years, Hypergraph Neural Networks (HNNs) have demonstrated immense
potential in handling complex systems with high-order interactions. However,
acquiring large-scale, high-quality labeled data for these models is costly,
making Active Learning (AL) a critical technique. Existing Graph Active
Learning (GAL) methods, when applied to hypergraphs, often rely on techniques
like "clique expansion," which destroys the high-order structural information
crucial to a hypergraph's success, thereby leading to suboptimal performance.
To address this challenge, we introduce HIAL (Hypergraph Active Learning), a
native active learning framework designed specifically for hypergraphs. We
innovatively reformulate the Hypergraph Active Learning (HAL) problem as an
Influence Maximization task. The core of HIAL is a dual-perspective influence
function that, based on our novel "High-Order Interaction-Aware (HOI-Aware)"
propagation mechanism, synergistically evaluates a node's feature-space
coverage (via Magnitude of Influence, MoI) and its topological influence (via
Expected Diffusion Value, EDV). We prove that this objective function is
monotone and submodular, thus enabling the use of an efficient greedy algorithm
with a formal (1-1/e) approximation guarantee. Extensive experiments on seven
public datasets demonstrate that HIAL significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in terms of performance, efficiency, generality, and
robustness, establishing an efficient and powerful new paradigm for active
learning on hypergraphs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MoKGR是一个混合专家框架，通过自适应路径探索提升知识图谱推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图神经网络在知识图谱推理中路径探索策略僵化，无法适应多样化的语言上下文和语义细微差别。

Method: MoKGR包含两个互补组件：长度专家混合（自适应选择路径长度）和剪枝专家混合（评估并保留最有信息量的路径）。

Result: 在多种基准测试中，MoKGR在传导和归纳设置下均表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: 个性化路径探索能有效提升知识图谱推理的效果。

Abstract: Knowledge Graph (KG) reasoning, which aims to infer new facts from structured
knowledge repositories, plays a vital role in Natural Language Processing (NLP)
systems. Its effectiveness critically depends on constructing informative and
contextually relevant reasoning paths. However, existing graph neural networks
(GNNs) often adopt rigid, query-agnostic path-exploration strategies, limiting
their ability to adapt to diverse linguistic contexts and semantic nuances. To
address these limitations, we propose \textbf{MoKGR}, a mixture-of-experts
framework that personalizes path exploration through two complementary
components: (1) a mixture of length experts that adaptively selects and weights
candidate path lengths according to query complexity, providing query-specific
reasoning depth; and (2) a mixture of pruning experts that evaluates candidate
paths from a complementary perspective, retaining the most informative paths
for each query. Through comprehensive experiments on diverse benchmark, MoKGR
demonstrates superior performance in both transductive and inductive settings,
validating the effectiveness of personalized path exploration in KGs reasoning.

TL;DR: 论文提出DmC框架，通过k-NN估计域接近度和扩散模型生成对齐样本，解决跨域离线RL中目标数据有限的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要大量目标数据，而实际场景中目标数据往往有限，导致数据集不平衡和部分域重叠问题。

Method: 使用k-NN估计域接近度避免过拟合，结合扩散模型生成对齐样本。

Result: DmC在多种环境中显著优于现有方法，性能提升明显。

Conclusion: DmC为有限目标数据下的跨域离线RL提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-domain offline reinforcement learning (RL) seeks to enhance sample
efficiency in offline RL by utilizing additional offline source datasets. A key
challenge is to identify and utilize source samples that are most relevant to
the target domain. Existing approaches address this challenge by measuring
domain gaps through domain classifiers, target transition dynamics modeling, or
mutual information estimation using contrastive loss. However, these methods
often require large target datasets, which is impractical in many real-world
scenarios. In this work, we address cross-domain offline RL under a limited
target data setting, identifying two primary challenges: (1) Dataset imbalance,
which is caused by large source and small target datasets and leads to
overfitting in neural network-based domain gap estimators, resulting in
uninformative measurements; and (2) Partial domain overlap, where only a subset
of the source data is closely aligned with the target domain. To overcome these
issues, we propose DmC, a novel framework for cross-domain offline RL with
limited target samples. Specifically, DmC utilizes $k$-nearest neighbor
($k$-NN) based estimation to measure domain proximity without neural network
training, effectively mitigating overfitting. Then, by utilizing this domain
proximity, we introduce a nearest-neighbor-guided diffusion model to generate
additional source samples that are better aligned with the target domain, thus
enhancing policy learning with more effective source samples. Through
theoretical analysis and extensive experiments in diverse MuJoCo environments,
we demonstrate that DmC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art cross-domain
offline RL methods, achieving substantial performance gains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有护栏方法在自定义政策和适应性上的局限性，需减少重新训练并提升对新政策的泛化能力。

Method: 采用“先例”条件化模型判断，引入批判-修订机制收集高质量先例，并提出两种利用先例的预测策略。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在少样本和全数据集场景下均优于现有方法，且对新政策具有更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 基于先例的方法显著提升了护栏的灵活性和适应性，适用于多样化和动态的政策需求。

Abstract: A multi-modal guardrail must effectively filter image content based on
user-defined policies, identifying material that may be hateful, reinforce
harmful stereotypes, contain explicit material, or spread misinformation.
Deploying such guardrails in real-world applications, however, poses
significant challenges. Users often require varied and highly customizable
policies and typically cannot provide abundant examples for each custom policy.
Consequently, an ideal guardrail should be scalable to the multiple policies
and adaptable to evolving user standards with minimal retraining. Existing
fine-tuning methods typically condition predictions on pre-defined policies,
restricting their generalizability to new policies or necessitating extensive
retraining to adapt. Conversely, training-free methods struggle with limited
context lengths, making it difficult to incorporate all the policies
comprehensively. To overcome these limitations, we propose to condition model's
judgment on "precedents", which are the reasoning processes of prior data
points similar to the given input. By leveraging precedents instead of fixed
policies, our approach greatly enhances the flexibility and adaptability of the
guardrail. In this paper, we introduce a critique-revise mechanism for
collecting high-quality precedents and two strategies that utilize precedents
for robust prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
outperforms previous methods across both few-shot and full-dataset scenarios
and exhibits superior generalization to novel policies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以捕捉高阶图特征，且对比学习过度依赖局部结构，传统粗化方法丢失细节。MPCCL旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 采用多尺度粗化策略和一对多对比学习范式，结合图重构损失和KL散度确保节点表示一致性。

Result: 在ACM数据集上NMI提升15.24%，在Citeseer、Cora和DBLP等小规模数据集上表现稳健。

Conclusion: MPCCL通过创新方法有效解决了图聚类中的关键问题，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: This study introduces the Multi-Scale Weight-Based Pairwise Coarsening and
Contrastive Learning (MPCCL) model, a novel approach for attributed graph
clustering that effectively bridges critical gaps in existing methods,
including long-range dependency, feature collapse, and information loss.
Traditional methods often struggle to capture high-order graph features due to
their reliance on low-order attribute information, while contrastive learning
techniques face limitations in feature diversity by overemphasizing local
neighborhood structures. Similarly, conventional graph coarsening methods,
though reducing graph scale, frequently lose fine-grained structural details.
MPCCL addresses these challenges through an innovative multi-scale coarsening
strategy, which progressively condenses the graph while prioritizing the
merging of key edges based on global node similarity to preserve essential
structural information. It further introduces a one-to-many contrastive
learning paradigm, integrating node embeddings with augmented graph views and
cluster centroids to enhance feature diversity, while mitigating feature
masking issues caused by the accumulation of high-frequency node weights during
multi-scale coarsening. By incorporating a graph reconstruction loss and KL
divergence into its self-supervised learning framework, MPCCL ensures
cross-scale consistency of node representations. Experimental evaluations
reveal that MPCCL achieves a significant improvement in clustering performance,
including a remarkable 15.24% increase in NMI on the ACM dataset and notable
robust gains on smaller-scale datasets such as Citeseer, Cora and DBLP.

Result: 在9个现成光学系统上训练，位置误差约1微米，角度偏差约0.01度。

Conclusion: 神经表示可作为光线追踪的有效替代方案。

Abstract: Ray tracing is a widely used technique for modeling optical systems,
involving sequential surface-by-surface computations, which can be
computationally intensive. We propose Ray2Ray, a novel method that leverages
implicit neural representations to model optical systems with greater
efficiency, eliminating the need for surface-by-surface computations in a
single pass end-to-end model. Ray2Ray learns the mapping between rays emitted
from a given source and their corresponding rays after passing through a given
optical system in a physically accurate manner. We train Ray2Ray on nine
off-the-shelf optical systems, achieving positional errors on the order of
1{\mu}m and angular deviations on the order 0.01 degrees in the estimated
output rays. Our work highlights the potential of neural representations as a
proxy for optical raytracer.

Result: KOBO在合成基准函数和实际应用（如助听器个性化、生成模型优化）中均表现优异，显著降低样本需求。

Conclusion: KOBO通过核优化有效减少样本预算，适用于高维空间中的黑盒优化问题。

Abstract: Black box optimization (BBO) focuses on optimizing unknown functions in
high-dimensional spaces. In many applications, sampling the unknown function is
expensive, imposing a tight sample budget. Ongoing work is making progress on
reducing the sample budget by learning the shape/structure of the function,
known as kernel learning. We propose a new method to learn the kernel of a
Gaussian Process. Our idea is to create a continuous kernel space in the latent
space of a variational autoencoder, and run an auxiliary optimization to
identify the best kernel. Results show that the proposed method, Kernel
Optimized Blackbox Optimization (KOBO), outperforms state of the art by
estimating the optimal at considerably lower sample budgets. Results hold not
only across synthetic benchmark functions but also in real applications. We
show that a hearing aid may be personalized with fewer audio queries to the
user, or a generative model could converge to desirable images from limited
user ratings.

Abstract: We introduce Kimi K2, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) large language model with 32
billion activated parameters and 1 trillion total parameters. We propose the
MuonClip optimizer, which improves upon Muon with a novel QK-clip technique to
address training instability while enjoying the advanced token efficiency of
Muon. Based on MuonClip, K2 was pre-trained on 15.5 trillion tokens with zero

process, highlighted by a large-scale agentic data synthesis pipeline and a
joint reinforcement learning (RL) stage, where the model improves its
capabilities through interactions with real and synthetic environments.
  Kimi K2 achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source non-thinking

Result: 在多种数据集上，STAFF在补全误差和组公平性之间取得最佳平衡，MSE和MADE分别降低36%和59%。

Conclusion: STAFF是一种有效的张量分解方法，显著提升了公平性和性能。

Abstract: Group fairness is important to consider in tensor decomposition to prevent
discrimination based on social grounds such as gender or age. Although few
works have studied group fairness in tensor decomposition, they suffer from
performance degradation. To address this, we propose STAFF(Sparse Tensor
Augmentation For Fairness) to improve group fairness by minimizing the gap in
completion errors of different groups while reducing the overall tensor
completion error. Our main idea is to augment a tensor with augmented entities
including sufficient observed entries to mitigate imbalance and group bias in
the sparse tensor. We evaluate \method on tensor completion with various
datasets under conventional and deep learning-based tensor models. STAFF
consistently shows the best trade-off between completion error and group
fairness; at most, it yields 36% lower MSE and 59% lower MADE than the
second-best baseline.

Conclusion: DAG-AFL有效解决了异步客户端参与和数据异质性问题，同时减少了区块链引入的资源开销。

Abstract: Due to the distributed nature of federated learning (FL), the vulnerability
of the global model and the need for coordination among many client devices
pose significant challenges. As a promising decentralized, scalable and secure
solution, blockchain-based FL methods have attracted widespread attention in
recent years. However, traditional consensus mechanisms designed for Proof of
Work (PoW) similar to blockchain incur substantial resource consumption and
compromise the efficiency of FL, particularly when participating devices are
wireless and resource-limited. To address asynchronous client participation and
data heterogeneity in FL, while limiting the additional resource overhead
introduced by blockchain, we propose the Directed Acyclic Graph-based
Asynchronous Federated Learning (DAG-AFL) framework. We develop a tip selection
algorithm that considers temporal freshness, node reachability and model
accuracy, with a DAG-based trusted verification strategy. Extensive experiments
on 3 benchmarking datasets against eight state-of-the-art approaches
demonstrate that DAG-AFL significantly improves training efficiency and model
accuracy by 22.7% and 6.5% on average, respectively.

Conclusion: 结论指出，近似遗忘算法存在隐私风险，提出的双阶段框架能有效降低风险，同时计算成本仅为完全重新训练的2-12%。

Abstract: Machine unlearning enables the removal of specific data from ML models to
uphold the right to be forgotten. While approximate unlearning algorithms offer
efficient alternatives to full retraining, this work reveals that they fail to
adequately protect the privacy of unlearned data. In particular, these
algorithms introduce implicit residuals which facilitate privacy attacks
targeting at unlearned data. We observe that these residuals persist regardless
of model architectures, parameters, and unlearning algorithms, exposing a new
attack surface beyond conventional output-based leakage. Based on this insight,
we propose the Reminiscence Attack (ReA), which amplifies the correlation
between residuals and membership privacy through targeted fine-tuning
processes. ReA achieves up to 1.90x and 1.12x higher accuracy than prior
attacks when inferring class-wise and sample-wise membership, respectively. To
mitigate such residual-induced privacy risk, we develop a dual-phase
approximate unlearning framework that first eliminates deep-layer unlearned
data traces and then enforces convergence stability to prevent models from
"pseudo-convergence", where their outputs are similar to retrained models but
still preserve unlearned residuals. Our framework works for both classification
and generation tasks. Experimental evaluations confirm that our approach
maintains high unlearning efficacy, while reducing the adaptive privacy attack
accuracy to nearly random guess, at the computational cost of 2-12% of full
retraining from scratch.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable versatility in adopting
diverse personas. In this study, we examine how assigning a persona influences
a model's reasoning on an objective task. Using activation patching, we take a
first step toward understanding how key components of the model encode
persona-specific information. Our findings reveal that the early Multi-Layer
Perceptron (MLP) layers attend not only to the syntactic structure of the input
but also process its semantic content. These layers transform persona tokens
into richer representations, which are then used by the middle Multi-Head
Attention (MHA) layers to shape the model's output. Additionally, we identify
specific attention heads that disproportionately attend to racial and
color-based identities.

Abstract: Aerodynamic analysis during aircraft design usually involves methods of
varying accuracy and spatial resolution, which all have their advantages and
disadvantages. It is therefore desirable to create data-driven models which
effectively combine these advantages. Such data fusion methods for distributed
quantities mainly rely on proper orthogonal decomposition as of now, which is a
linear method. In this paper, we introduce a non-linear method based on neural
networks combining simulation and measurement data via transfer learning. The
network training accounts for the heterogeneity of the data, as simulation data
usually features a high spatial resolution, while measurement data is sparse
but more accurate. In a first step, the neural network is trained on simulation
data to learn spatial features of the distributed quantities. The second step
involves transfer learning on the measurement data to correct for systematic
errors between simulation and measurement by only re-training a small subset of
the entire neural network model. This approach is applied to a multilayer
perceptron architecture and shows significant improvements over the established
method based on proper orthogonal decomposition by producing more physical
solutions near nonlinearities. In addition, the neural network provides
solutions at arbitrary flow conditions, thus making the model useful for flight
mechanical design, structural sizing, and certification. As the proposed
training strategy is very general, it can also be applied to more complex

TL;DR: PhaseNAS是一种基于LLM的NAS框架，通过动态阶段转换和结构化模板语言，提高了搜索效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决NAS在探索搜索空间和效率之间的权衡问题，尤其是针对复杂任务时静态搜索策略和模糊架构表示的局限性。

Method: 提出PhaseNAS框架，结合实时评分阈值引导的动态阶段转换和结构化架构模板语言，实现一致的代码生成。

Result: 在NAS-Bench-Macro基准测试中表现优异，图像分类任务搜索时间减少86%，目标检测任务生成更高mAP和更低资源消耗的YOLOv8变体。

Conclusion: PhaseNAS是一种高效、自适应且通用的NAS方法，适用于多种视觉任务。

Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is challenged by the trade-off between
search space exploration and efficiency, especially for complex tasks. While
recent LLM-based NAS methods have shown promise, they often suffer from static
search strategies and ambiguous architecture representations. We propose
PhaseNAS, an LLM-based NAS framework with dynamic phase transitions guided by
real-time score thresholds and a structured architecture template language for
consistent code generation. On the NAS-Bench-Macro benchmark, PhaseNAS
consistently discovers architectures with higher accuracy and better rank. For
image classification (CIFAR-10/100), PhaseNAS reduces search time by up to 86%
while maintaining or improving accuracy. In object detection, it automatically
produces YOLOv8 variants with higher mAP and lower resource cost. These results
demonstrate that PhaseNAS enables efficient, adaptive, and generalizable NAS
across diverse vision tasks.

*Yining Huang,Bin Li,Keke Tang,Meilian Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出LoRA-PAR框架，通过双系统分区数据和参数，结合SFT和RL两阶段微调，降低参数使用量并超越现有PEFT方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受"快思考与慢思考"启发，认为LLM参数可能针对快速直觉（System 1）和多步逻辑推理（System 2）任务有不同分工，需针对性优化。

Method: 分类任务数据并通过角色扮演和投票分区参数，采用SFT和RL两阶段微调：SFT用于System 1任务，RL用于System 2任务。

Result: 实验表明，两阶段微调策略在减少参数使用量的同时，性能匹配或超越现有PEFT基线。

Conclusion: LoRA-PAR框架通过双系统分区和两阶段微调，实现了参数高效性和性能提升。

Abstract: Large-scale generative models like DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI-O1 benefit
substantially from chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, yet pushing their
performance typically requires vast data, large model sizes, and full-parameter
fine-tuning. While parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) helps reduce cost,
most existing approaches primarily address domain adaptation or layer-wise
allocation rather than explicitly tailoring data and parameters to different
response demands. Inspired by "Thinking, Fast and Slow," which characterizes
two distinct modes of thought-System 1 (fast, intuitive, often automatic) and
System 2 (slower, more deliberative and analytic)-we draw an analogy that
different "subregions" of an LLM's parameters might similarly specialize for
tasks that demand quick, intuitive responses versus those requiring multi-step
logical reasoning. Therefore, we propose LoRA-PAR, a dual-system LoRA framework
that partitions both data and parameters by System 1 or System 2 demands, using
fewer yet more focused parameters for each task. Specifically, we classify task
data via multi-model role-playing and voting, and partition parameters based on
importance scoring, then adopt a two-stage fine-tuning strategy of training
System 1 tasks with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance knowledge and
intuition and refine System 2 tasks with reinforcement learning (RL) to
reinforce deeper logical deliberation next. Extensive experiments show that the
two-stage fine-tuning strategy, SFT and RL, lowers active parameter usage while
matching or surpassing SOTA PEFT baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于深度生成神经网络的方法，用于模拟等位基因频率轨迹，解决了传统模型在假设和参数上的局限性，并在Pool-Seq数据中实现了竞争性的连锁不平衡估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统统计模型（如Wright-Fisher模型）在假设和参数上存在局限性，而深度生成神经网络能够整合多变量依赖和降噪，但尚未广泛应用于群体基因组学。

Method: 提出了一种深度生成神经网络模型，通过嵌入单核苷酸多态性（SNPs）及其邻近位点的信息，模拟等位基因频率轨迹的分布。

Result: 模型在模拟实验中成功捕捉了等位基因频率轨迹的分布，并在Pool-Seq数据中实现了竞争性的连锁不平衡估计。

Conclusion: 深度生成模型在群体基因组学中具有潜力，尤其是在处理Pool-Seq数据时，能够提供传统方法难以获得的信息。

Abstract: The investigation of allele frequency trajectories in populations evolving
under controlled environmental pressures has become a popular approach to study
evolutionary processes on the molecular level. Statistical models based on
well-defined evolutionary concepts can be used to validate different hypotheses
about empirical observations. Despite their popularity, classic statistical
models like the Wright-Fisher model suffer from simplified assumptions such as
the independence of selected loci along a chromosome and uncertainty about the
parameters. Deep generative neural networks offer a powerful alternative known
for the integration of multivariate dependencies and noise reduction. Due to
their high data demands and challenging interpretability they have, so far, not
been widely considered in the area of population genomics. To address the
challenges in the area of Evolve and Resequencing experiments (E&R) based on
pooled sequencing (Pool-Seq) data, we introduce a deep generative neural
network that aims to model a concept of evolution based on empirical
observations over time. The proposed model estimates the distribution of allele
frequency trajectories by embedding the observations from single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) with information from neighboring loci. Evaluation on
simulated E&R experiments demonstrates the model's ability to capture the
distribution of allele frequency trajectories and illustrates the
representational power of deep generative models on the example of linkage
disequilibrium (LD) estimation. Inspecting the internally learned
representations enables estimating pairwise LD, which is typically inaccessible
in Pool-Seq data. Our model provides competitive LD estimation in Pool-Seq data
high degree of LD when compared to existing methods.

*Filip de Roos,Fabio Muratore*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文探讨了Cholesky分解中新的枢轴选择策略，通过改进数值稳定性，提高了在稀疏回归和迭代求解器任务中的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cholesky分解在对称正定矩阵的线性系统中广泛应用，但其数值稳定性可通过枢轴策略改进。本文旨在探索新的枢轴选择策略以提高效率。

Method: 提出基于贝叶斯非参数推断的枢轴选择策略，与传统贪心熵最大化策略对比，并实现定制化算法。

Result: 新策略在稀疏回归和迭代求解器任务中表现优于传统方法，计算开销可忽略不计。

Conclusion: 新枢轴策略显著提升Cholesky分解的效率，适用于高斯过程相关任务。

Abstract: The Cholesky decomposition is a fundamental tool for solving linear systems
with symmetric and positive definite matrices which are ubiquitous in linear
algebra, optimization, and machine learning. Its numerical stability can be
improved by introducing a pivoting strategy that iteratively permutes the rows
and columns of the matrix. The order of pivoting indices determines how
accurately the intermediate decomposition can reconstruct the original matrix,
thus is decisive for the algorithm's efficiency in the case of early
termination. Standard implementations select the next pivot from the largest
value on the diagonal. In the case of Bayesian nonparametric inference, this
strategy corresponds to greedy entropy maximization, which is often used in
active learning and design of experiments. We explore this connection in detail
and deduce novel pivoting strategies for the Cholesky decomposition. The
resulting algorithms are more efficient at reducing the uncertainty over a data
set, can be updated to include information about observations, and additionally
benefit from a tailored implementation. We benchmark the effectiveness of the
new selection strategies on two tasks important to Gaussian processes: sparse
regression and inference based on preconditioned iterative solvers. Our results
show that the proposed selection strategies are either on par or, in most
cases, outperform traditional baselines while requiring a negligible amount of
additional computation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI算法在现实应用中的广泛部署，证明其合规性成为重要挑战。欧盟AI法案要求检查可能的偏见行为，而全球公平性度量（如差异影响）高度依赖于样本分布。

Method: 研究通过熵或最优传输投影在公平性约束下修改经验分布的方法，并分析如何检测数据操纵。

Result: 提出了数学上可靠的方法来修改数据以满足公平性约束，并提供了检测操纵的建议。实验结果验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 论文为审计人员提供了检测数据操纵的工具，同时揭示了潜在规避公平性检查的方法。

Abstract: Proving the compliance of AI algorithms has become an important challenge
with the growing deployment of such algorithms for real-life applications.
Inspecting possible biased behaviors is mandatory to satisfy the constraints of
the regulations of the EU Artificial Intelligence's Act. Regulation-driven
audits increasingly rely on global fairness metrics, with Disparate Impact
being the most widely used. Yet such global measures depend highly on the
distribution of the sample on which the measures are computed. We investigate
first how to manipulate data samples to artificially satisfy fairness criteria,
creating minimally perturbed datasets that remain statistically
indistinguishable from the original distribution while satisfying prescribed
fairness constraints. Then we study how to detect such manipulation. Our
analysis (i) introduces mathematically sound methods for modifying empirical
distributions under fairness constraints using entropic or optimal transport
projections, (ii) examines how an auditee could potentially circumvent fairness
inspections, and (iii) offers recommendations to help auditors detect such data
manipulations. These results are validated through experiments on classical
tabular datasets in bias detection.

Abstract: Prostate cancer, the second most prevalent male malignancy, requires advanced
diagnostic tools. We propose an explainable AI system combining BERT (for
textual clinical notes) and Random Forest (for numerical lab data) through a
novel multimodal fusion strategy, achieving superior classification performance
on PLCO-NIH dataset (98% accuracy, 99% AUC). While multimodal fusion is
established, our work demonstrates that a simple yet interpretable BERT+RF
pipeline delivers clinically significant improvements - particularly for
intermediate cancer stages (Class 2/3 recall: 0.900 combined vs 0.824
numerical/0.725 textual). SHAP analysis provides transparent feature importance
rankings, while ablation studies prove textual features' complementary value.
This accessible approach offers hospitals a balance of high performance
(F1=89%), computational efficiency, and clinical interpretability - addressing
critical needs in prostate cancer diagnostics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有嵌入模型在不同领域表现不一，且传统集成方法未考虑模型不确定性，限制了鲁棒性。

Method: UEC将确定性嵌入转化为概率嵌入，基于不确定性计算自适应权重，并引入不确定性感知的相似度函数。

Result: 在检索、分类和语义相似度任务中，UEC显著提升了性能和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: UEC通过不确定性建模，为嵌入集成提供了更可靠和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Text embeddings are essential components in modern NLP pipelines. While
numerous embedding models have been proposed, their performance varies across
domains, and no single model consistently excels across all tasks. This
variability motivates the use of ensemble techniques to combine complementary
strengths. However, most existing ensemble methods operate on deterministic
embeddings and fail to account for model-specific uncertainty, limiting their
robustness and reliability in downstream applications. To address these
limitations, we propose Uncertainty-driven Embedding Convolution (UEC). UEC
first transforms deterministic embeddings into probabilistic ones in a post-hoc
manner. It then computes adaptive ensemble weights based on embedding
uncertainty, grounded in a Bayes-optimal solution under a surrogate loss.
Additionally, UEC introduces an uncertainty-aware similarity function that
directly incorporates uncertainty into similarity scoring. Extensive
experiments on retrieval, classification, and semantic similarity benchmarks
demonstrate that UEC consistently improves both performance and robustness by
leveraging principled uncertainty modeling.

Method: 利用RAGTruth语料库的令牌级标注和重现的逻辑值，分析幻觉信号如何依赖于令牌在幻觉片段中的位置。

Result: 结果表明，首个幻觉令牌的信号更强且更易检测。

Conclusion: 研究改进了对令牌级幻觉的理解，并发布了分析框架和相关代码。

Abstract: Hallucination, the generation of untruthful content, is one of the major
concerns regarding foundational models. Detecting hallucinations at the token
level is vital for real-time filtering and targeted correction, yet the
variation of hallucination signals within token sequences is not fully
understood. Leveraging the RAGTruth corpus with token-level annotations and
reproduced logits, we analyse how these signals depend on a token's position
within hallucinated spans, contributing to an improved understanding of
token-level hallucination. Our results show that the first hallucinated token
carries a stronger signal and is more detectable than conditional tokens. We
release our analysis framework, along with code for logit reproduction and
metric computation at https://github.com/jakobsnl/RAGTruth_Xtended.

Abstract: Due to the extensive availability of operation data, data-driven methods show
strong capabilities in predicting building energy loads. Buildings with similar
features often share energy patterns, reflected by spatial dependencies in
their operational data, which conventional prediction methods struggle to
capture. To overcome this, we propose a multi-building prediction approach
using spatio-temporal graph neural networks, comprising graph representation,
graph learning, and interpretation. First, a graph is built based on building
characteristics and environmental factors. Next, a multi-level graph
convolutional architecture with attention is developed for energy prediction.
Lastly, a method interpreting the optimized graph structure is introduced.
Experiments on the Building Data Genome Project 2 dataset confirm superior
performance over baselines such as XGBoost, SVR, FCNN, GRU, and Naive,
highlighting the method's robustness, generalization, and interpretability in
capturing meaningful building similarities and spatial relationships.

Abstract: Deep clustering uncovers hidden patterns and groups in complex time series
data, yet its opaque decision-making limits use in safety-critical settings.
This survey offers a structured overview of explainable deep clustering for
time series, collecting current methods and their real-world applications. We
thoroughly discuss and compare peer-reviewed and preprint papers through
application domains across healthcare, finance, IoT, and climate science. Our
analysis reveals that most work relies on autoencoder and attention
architectures, with limited support for streaming, irregularly sampled, or
privacy-preserved series, and interpretability is still primarily treated as an
add-on. To push the field forward, we outline six research opportunities: (1)
combining complex networks with built-in interpretability; (2) setting up
clear, faithfulness-focused evaluation metrics for unsupervised explanations;
(3) building explainers that adapt to live data streams; (4) crafting
explanations tailored to specific domains; (5) adding human-in-the-loop methods
that refine clusters and explanations together; and (6) improving our
understanding of how time series clustering models work internally. By making
interpretability a primary design goal rather than an afterthought, we propose
the groundwork for the next generation of trustworthy deep clustering time
series analytics.

Result: 证明了可达状态流形的维度与动作空间维度相关，并在MuJoCo环境和玩具环境中验证了理论。

Conclusion: 通过引入局部流形学习层，改进了高自由度控制环境的性能，为连续空间强化学习提供了新的理论支持。

Abstract: Advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have led to its successful
application in complex tasks with continuous state and action spaces. Despite
these advances in practice, most theoretical work pertains to finite state and
action spaces. We propose building a theoretical understanding of continuous
state and action spaces by employing a geometric lens to understand the locally
attained set of states. The set of all parametrised policies learnt through a
semi-gradient based approach induces a set of attainable states in RL. We show
that the training dynamics of a two-layer neural policy induce a low
dimensional manifold of attainable states embedded in the high-dimensional
nominal state space trained using an actor-critic algorithm. We prove that,
under certain conditions, the dimensionality of this manifold is of the order
of the dimensionality of the action space. This is the first result of its
kind, linking the geometry of the state space to the dimensionality of the
action space. We empirically corroborate this upper bound for four MuJoCo
environments and also demonstrate the results in a toy environment with varying
dimensionality. We also show the applicability of this theoretical result by
introducing a local manifold learning layer to the policy and value function
networks to improve the performance in control environments with very high
degrees of freedom by changing one layer of the neural network to learn sparse
representations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究开发了一种基于多模态数据的Bi-cephalic Self-Attention Model (BiSAM)，用于通过静息态EEG信号结合人口统计学和临床变量客观检测帕金森病患者的步态功能障碍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 帕金森病（PD）常导致运动和认知障碍，尤其是冻结步态（FOG）患者。现有检测方法主观性强或依赖专业设备，因此需要一种客观、数据驱动的多模态分类模型。

Method: 研究使用124名参与者（42名PDFOG+、41名PDFOG-和41名健康对照）的数据，提取静息态EEG特征和描述性变量（如年龄、教育程度、病程），训练BiSAM模型，测试了信号、描述性和多模态三种模式。

Result: 信号和描述性模型表现有限（最高准确率分别为55%和68%），而多模态模型显著优于两者（BiSAM-8和BiSAM-4达到88%准确率）。

Conclusion: 多模态BiSAM模型结合EEG和描述性特征，为PDFOG+检测提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案，有望用于临床监测和早期诊断。

Abstract: Parkinson Disease (PD) often results in motor and cognitive impairments,
including gait dysfunction, particularly in patients with freezing of gait
(FOG). Current detection methods are either subjective or reliant on
specialized gait analysis tools. This study aims to develop an objective,
data-driven, and multi-modal classification model to detect gait dysfunction in
PD patients using resting-state EEG signals combined with demographic and
clinical variables. We utilized a dataset of 124 participants: 42 PD patients
with FOG (PDFOG+), 41 without FOG (PDFOG-), and 41 age-matched healthy
controls. Features extracted from resting-state EEG and descriptive variables
(age, education, disease duration) were used to train a novel Bi-cephalic
Self-Attention Model (BiSAM). We tested three modalities: signal-only,
descriptive-only, and multi-modal, across different EEG channel subsets
(BiSAM-63, -16, -8, and -4). Signal-only and descriptive-only models showed
limited performance, achieving a maximum accuracy of 55% and 68%, respectively.
In contrast, the multi-modal models significantly outperformed both, with
BiSAM-8 and BiSAM-4 achieving the highest classification accuracy of 88%. These
results demonstrate the value of integrating EEG with objective descriptive
features for robust PDFOG+ detection. This study introduces a multi-modal,
attention-based architecture that objectively classifies PDFOG+ using minimal
EEG channels and descriptive variables. This approach offers a scalable and
efficient alternative to traditional assessments, with potential applications
in routine clinical monitoring and early diagnosis of PD-related gait
dysfunction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多标签数据流中存在分布演化、高维标签空间、稀疏标签和复杂标签依赖等问题，且概念漂移影响标签相关性和不平衡比例，需要适应性强的模型。

Method: iHOMER采用增量式层次聚类（基于Jaccard相似度）和全局树学习器（基于多元Bernoulli过程），并结合全局和局部漂移检测机制动态调整标签分区。

Result: 在23个真实数据集上，iHOMER比5种全局基线方法提升23%，比12种局部基线方法提升32%。

Conclusion: iHOMER在在线多标签分类中表现出色，具有鲁棒性和动态适应性。

Abstract: Mining data streams with multi-label outputs poses significant challenges due
to evolving distributions, high-dimensional label spaces, sparse label
occurrences, and complex label dependencies. Moreover, concept drift affects
not only input distributions but also label correlations and imbalance ratios
over time, complicating model adaptation. To address these challenges,
structured learners are categorized into local and global methods. Local
methods break down the task into simpler components, while global methods adapt
the algorithm to the full output space, potentially yielding better predictions
by exploiting label correlations. This work introduces iHOMER (Incremental
Hierarchy Of Multi-label Classifiers), an online multi-label learning framework
that incrementally partitions the label space into disjoint, correlated
clusters without relying on predefined hierarchies. iHOMER leverages online
divisive-agglomerative clustering based on \textit{Jaccard} similarity and a
global tree-based learner driven by a multivariate \textit{Bernoulli} process
to guide instance partitioning. To address non-stationarity, it integrates
drift detection mechanisms at both global and local levels, enabling dynamic
restructuring of label partitions and subtrees. Experiments across 23
real-world datasets show iHOMER outperforms 5 state-of-the-art global
baselines, such as MLHAT, MLHT of Pruned Sets and iSOUPT, by 23\%, and 12 local
baselines, such as binary relevance transformations of kNN, EFDT, ARF, and
ADWIN bagging/boosting ensembles, by 32\%, establishing its robustness for
online multi-label classification.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统调查方法因用户疲劳和不完整响应而受限，需要更有效的行为建模方法。

Method: LANTERN采用选择性门控、残差连接和跨注意力机制，以调查数据为主信号，仅在相关时引入外部模态。

Result: LANTERN在多标签预测中优于仅调查的基线，并通过消融实验验证了选择性模态依赖的优势。

Conclusion: LANTERN为以调查为中心的应用提供了实用且可扩展的行为建模方案。

Abstract: Modeling user behavior is critical across many industries where understanding
preferences, intent, or decisions informs personalization, targeting, and
strategic outcomes. Surveys have long served as a classical mechanism for
collecting such behavioral data due to their interpretability, structure, and
ease of deployment. However, surveys alone are inherently limited by user
fatigue, incomplete responses, and practical constraints on their length making
them insufficient for capturing user behavior. In this work, we present LANTERN
(Late-Attentive Network for Enriched Response Modeling), a modular architecture
for modeling user behavior by fusing adaptive survey responses with
supplemental contextual signals. We demonstrate the architectural value of
maintaining survey primacy through selective gating, residual connections and
late fusion via cross-attention, treating survey data as the primary signal
while incorporating external modalities only when relevant. LANTERN outperforms
strong survey-only baselines in multi-label prediction of survey responses. We
further investigate threshold sensitivity and the benefits of selective
modality reliance through ablation and rare/frequent attribute analysis.
LANTERN's modularity supports scalable integration of new encoders and evolving
datasets. This work provides a practical and extensible blueprint for behavior
modeling in survey-centric applications.

Conclusion: 该方法在零样本CPI预测中表现优异，特别适合数据稀缺场景，为药物开发提供了高效工具。

Abstract: Given the vastness of chemical space and the ongoing emergence of previously
uncharacterized proteins, zero-shot compound-protein interaction (CPI)
prediction better reflects the practical challenges and requirements of
real-world drug development. Although existing methods perform adequately
during certain CPI tasks, they still face the following challenges: (1)
Representation learning from local or complete protein sequences often
overlooks the complex interdependencies between subsequences, which are
essential for predicting spatial structures and binding properties. (2)
Dependence on large-scale or scarce multimodal protein datasets demands
significant training data and computational resources, limiting scalability and
efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that
pretrains protein representations for CPI prediction tasks using subsequence
reordering, explicitly capturing the dependencies between protein subsequences.
Furthermore, we apply length-variable protein augmentation to ensure excellent
pretraining performance on small training datasets. To evaluate the model's
effectiveness and zero-shot learning ability, we combine it with various
baseline methods. The results demonstrate that our approach can improve the
baseline model's performance on the CPI task, especially in the challenging
zero-shot scenario. Compared to existing pre-training models, our model
demonstrates superior performance, particularly in data-scarce scenarios where
training samples are limited. Our implementation is available at

*Wei Shan Lee,Chi Kiu Althina Chau,Kei Chon Sio,Kam Ian Leong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种混合傅里叶-神经网络架构，显著提升了PINNs在四阶偏微分方程中的精度，实现了前所未有的低误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决PINNs在四阶偏微分方程中误差停滞的问题，突破精度天花板，推动其在工程中的应用。

Method: 结合截断傅里叶级数和深度神经网络，通过两阶段优化策略（Adam和L-BFGS）和自适应权重平衡实现高精度。

Result: L2误差降至1.94×10^-7，比标准PINNs提升17倍，比传统数值方法提升15-500倍。

Conclusion: 通过合理设计，机器学习可以在科学计算中达到或超越传统数值方法的精度，为相关领域开辟新范式。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have plateaued at errors of
$10^{-3}$-$10^{-4}$ for fourth-order partial differential equations, creating a
perceived precision ceiling that limits their adoption in engineering
applications. We break through this barrier with a hybrid Fourier-neural
architecture for the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation, achieving unprecedented L2
error of $1.94 \times 10^{-7}$-a 17-fold improvement over standard PINNs and
\(15-500\times\) better than traditional numerical methods. Our approach
synergistically combines a truncated Fourier series capturing dominant modal
behavior with a deep neural network providing adaptive residual corrections. A
systematic harmonic optimization study revealed a counter-intuitive discovery:
exactly 10 harmonics yield optimal performance, with accuracy catastrophically
degrading from $10^{-7}$ to $10^{-1}$ beyond this threshold. The two-phase
optimization strategy (Adam followed by L-BFGS) and adaptive weight balancing
enable stable ultra-precision convergence. GPU-accelerated implementation
achieves sub-30-minute training despite fourth-order derivative complexity. By
addressing 12 critical gaps in existing approaches-from architectural rigidity
to optimization landscapes-this work demonstrates that ultra-precision is
achievable through proper design, opening new paradigms for scientific
computing where machine learning can match or exceed traditional numerical
methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有图生成方法在处理复杂异构图时的局限性，尤其是语义保真度不足的问题。

Method: 提出ProvCreator框架，将图合成任务转化为序列生成问题，使用Transformer模型进行编码和解码。

Result: 在网络安全和知识图谱领域验证了ProvCreator的有效性，能够生成具有复杂依赖关系的真实合成数据。

Conclusion: ProvCreator为复杂异构图的合成提供了一种高效且语义保真的解决方案。

Abstract: The rise of graph-structured data has driven interest in graph learning and
synthetic data generation. While successful in text and image domains,
synthetic graph generation remains challenging -- especially for real-world
graphs with complex, heterogeneous schemas. Existing research has focused
mostly on homogeneous structures with simple attributes, limiting their
usefulness and relevance for application domains requiring semantic fidelity.
  In this research, we introduce ProvCreator, a synthetic graph framework
designed for complex heterogeneous graphs with high-dimensional node and edge
attributes. ProvCreator formulates graph synthesis as a sequence generation
task, enabling the use of transformer-based large language models. It features
a versatile graph-to-sequence encoder-decoder that 1. losslessly encodes graph
structure and attributes, 2. efficiently compresses large graphs for contextual
modeling, and 3. supports end-to-end, learnable graph generation.
  To validate our research, we evaluate ProvCreator on two challenging domains:
system provenance graphs in cybersecurity and knowledge graphs from
IntelliGraph Benchmark Dataset. In both cases, ProvCreator captures intricate
dependencies between structure and semantics, enabling the generation of
realistic and privacy-aware synthetic datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出DARSD框架，通过表示空间分解解决时间序列分析中的领域偏移问题，优于现有12种UDA算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 领域偏移导致模型在目标域表现不佳，现有UDA方法未充分利用特征的内在组成。

Method: DARSD框架包含三个组件：对抗学习的公共不变基、原型伪标签机制和混合对比优化策略。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上，DARSD在53个跨域场景中的35个表现最优。

Conclusion: DARSD通过表示空间分解和知识解耦，显著提升了领域适应性能。

Abstract: Domain shift poses a fundamental challenge in time series analysis, where
models trained on source domain often fail dramatically when applied in target
domain with different yet similar distributions. While current unsupervised
domain adaptation (UDA) methods attempt to align cross-domain feature
distributions, they typically treat features as indivisible entities, ignoring
their intrinsic compositions that governs domain adaptation. We introduce
DARSD, a novel UDA framework with theoretical explainability that explicitly
realizes UDA tasks from the perspective of representation space decomposition.
Our core insight is that effective domain adaptation requires not just
alignment, but principled disentanglement of transferable knowledge from mixed
representations. DARSD consists three synergistic components: (I) An
adversarial learnable common invariant basis that projects original features
into a domain-invariant subspace while preserving semantic content; (II) A
prototypical pseudo-labeling mechanism that dynamically separates target
features based on confidence, hindering error accumulation; (III) A hybrid
contrastive optimization strategy that simultaneously enforces feature
clustering and consistency while mitigating emerging distribution gaps.
Comprehensive experiments conducted on four benchmark datasets (WISDM, HAR,
HHAR, and MFD) demonstrate DARSD's superiority against 12 UDA algorithms,
achieving optimal performance in 35 out of 53 cross-domain scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SAE Debias是一种轻量级、模型无关的框架，用于减少文本到图像（T2I）生成中的性别偏见，通过稀疏自编码器识别和抑制性别相关方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: T2I扩散模型常表现出性别偏见，尤其是职业与性别之间的刻板关联。现有方法依赖CLIP过滤或提示工程，效果有限且需模型特定调整。

Method: 利用预训练的k稀疏自编码器在稀疏潜在空间中识别性别相关方向，并在推理时抑制这些方向以生成更平衡的输出。

Result: 在多个T2I模型（如Stable Diffusion系列）上验证，SAE Debias显著减少性别偏见且保持生成质量。

Conclusion: SAE Debias是首个利用稀疏自编码器干预T2I性别偏见的工作，为构建公平的生成AI提供了可解释且模型无关的工具。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models often exhibit gender bias, particularly
by generating stereotypical associations between professions and gendered
subjects. This paper presents SAE Debias, a lightweight and model-agnostic
framework for mitigating such bias in T2I generation. Unlike prior approaches
that rely on CLIP-based filtering or prompt engineering, which often require
model-specific adjustments and offer limited control, SAE Debias operates
directly within the feature space without retraining or architectural
modifications. By leveraging a k-sparse autoencoder pre-trained on a gender
bias dataset, the method identifies gender-relevant directions within the
sparse latent space, capturing professional stereotypes. Specifically, a biased
direction per profession is constructed from sparse latents and suppressed
during inference to steer generations toward more gender-balanced outputs.
Trained only once, the sparse autoencoder provides a reusable debiasing
direction, offering effective control and interpretable insight into biased
subspaces. Extensive evaluations across multiple T2I models, including Stable
Diffusion 1.4, 1.5, 2.1, and SDXL, demonstrate that SAE Debias substantially
reduces gender bias while preserving generation quality. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work to apply sparse autoencoders for identifying
and intervening in gender bias within T2I models. These findings contribute
toward building socially responsible generative AI, providing an interpretable
and model-agnostic tool to support fairness in text-to-image generation.

Motivation: 挑战现有LLM依赖GPU云基础设施的范式，为本地设备的计算、存储和内存限制提供原生解决方案。

Method: 采用两级稀疏结构（MoE和稀疏前馈网络）、预注意力路由器和NoPE-RoPE混合稀疏注意力机制，优化计算、存储和内存效率。

Result: SmallThinker-4B-A0.6B和SmallThinker-21B-A3B在性能上超越更大模型，并在普通CPU上实现高效推理。

Conclusion: SmallThinker证明了在本地设备上高效运行LLM的可行性，减少了对昂贵GPU硬件的依赖。

Abstract: While frontier large language models (LLMs) continue to push capability
boundaries, their deployment remains confined to GPU-powered cloud
infrastructure. We challenge this paradigm with SmallThinker, a family of LLMs
natively designed - not adapted - for the unique constraints of local devices:
weak computational power, limited memory, and slow storage. Unlike traditional
approaches that mainly compress existing models built for clouds, we architect
SmallThinker from the ground up to thrive within these limitations. Our
innovation lies in a deployment-aware architecture that transforms constraints
into design principles. First, We introduce a two-level sparse structure
combining fine-grained Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with sparse feed-forward
networks, drastically reducing computational demands without sacrificing model
capacity. Second, to conquer the I/O bottleneck of slow storage, we design a
pre-attention router that enables our co-designed inference engine to prefetch
expert parameters from storage while computing attention, effectively hiding
storage latency that would otherwise cripple on-device inference. Third, for
memory efficiency, we utilize NoPE-RoPE hybrid sparse attention mechanism to
slash KV cache requirements. We release SmallThinker-4B-A0.6B and
SmallThinker-21B-A3B, which achieve state-of-the-art performance scores and
even outperform larger LLMs. Remarkably, our co-designed system mostly
eliminates the need for expensive GPU hardware: with Q4_0 quantization, both
models exceed 20 tokens/s on ordinary consumer CPUs, while consuming only 1GB
and 8GB of memory respectively. SmallThinker is publicly available at
hf.co/PowerInfer/SmallThinker-4BA0.6B-Instruct and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖结构化协变量，限制了在非结构化数据中的应用。非结构化数据（如医疗记录）在因果推断中潜力巨大。

Method: 1. 提出基于神经表示的近似'插件'方法；2. 引入两种理论基础的估计器，利用训练时的结构化测量避免混淆偏差；3. 针对非代表性子集数据，提出回归校正方法。

Result: 实验表明，插件方法在非结构化数据上表现优异，尽管方法简单。

Conclusion: 论文通过新方法扩展了非结构化数据在因果推断中的应用，并解决了混淆和抽样偏差问题。

Abstract: Existing methods for estimating personalized treatment effects typically rely
on structured covariates, limiting their applicability to unstructured data.
Yet, leveraging unstructured data for causal inference has considerable
application potential, for instance in healthcare, where clinical notes or
medical images are abundant. To this end, we first introduce an approximate
'plug-in' method trained directly on the neural representations of unstructured
data. However, when these fail to capture all confounding information, the
method may be subject to confounding bias. We therefore introduce two
theoretically grounded estimators that leverage structured measurements of the
confounders during training, but allow estimating personalized treatment
effects purely from unstructured inputs, while avoiding confounding bias. When
these structured measurements are only available for a non-representative
subset of the data, these estimators may suffer from sampling bias. To address
this, we further introduce a regression-based correction that accounts for the
non-uniform sampling, assuming the sampling mechanism is known or can be
well-estimated. Our experiments on two benchmark datasets show that the plug-in
method, directly trainable on large unstructured datasets, achieves strong
empirical performance across all settings, despite its simplicity.

Motivation: 现实中的机器学习部署需要模型不断更新、组合和选择性撤销，但现有方法存在任务干扰、灾难性遗忘或缺乏可逆性。

Method: 通过将任务特定模型编码为共享基础的增量，并投影到正交子空间以避免冲突，再通过梯度优化合并为统一模型。

Result: 在视觉和自然语言处理基准测试中，MDM-OC在准确性、后向转移和撤销保真度上优于现有基线，且内存高效、计算可行。

Conclusion: MDM-OC为模块化和合规的AI系统设计提供了原则性解决方案。

Abstract: In real-world machine learning deployments, models must be continually
updated, composed, and when required, selectively undone. However, existing
approaches to model merging and continual learning often suffer from task
interference, catastrophic forgetting, or lack of reversibility. We propose
Modular Delta Merging with Orthogonal Constraints (MDM-OC), a novel framework
that enables scalable, interference-free, and reversible composition of
fine-tuned models. Each task-specific model is encoded as a delta from a shared
base and projected into an orthogonal subspace to eliminate conflict. These
projected deltas are then merged via gradient-based optimization to form a
unified model that retains performance across tasks. Our approach supports
continual integration of new models, structured unmerging for compliance such
as GDPR requirements, and model stability via elastic weight consolidation and
synthetic replay. Extensive experiments on vision and natural language
processing benchmarks demonstrate that MDM-OC outperforms prior baselines in
accuracy, backward transfer, and unmerge fidelity, while remaining
memory-efficient and computationally tractable. This framework offers a
principled solution for modular and compliant AI system design.

Motivation: 解决DNN黑盒特性在高风险领域部署受限的问题，提供兼具高性能和透明性的模型。

Result: 在多个领域（如CIFAR-10）表现优异（96.24%准确率），优于现有可解释模型。

Conclusion: CFNs结合了深度学习的表达能力和数学函数的可解释性，适用于性能与透明性并重的场景。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) deliver impressive performance but their
black-box nature limits deployment in high-stakes domains requiring
transparency. We introduce Compositional Function Networks (CFNs), a novel
framework that builds inherently interpretable models by composing elementary
mathematical functions with clear semantics. Unlike existing interpretable
approaches that are limited to simple additive structures, CFNs support diverse
compositional patterns -- sequential, parallel, and conditional -- enabling
complex feature interactions while maintaining transparency. A key innovation
is that CFNs are fully differentiable, allowing efficient training through
standard gradient descent. We demonstrate CFNs' versatility across multiple
domains, from symbolic regression to image classification with deep
hierarchical networks. Our empirical evaluation shows CFNs achieve competitive
performance against black-box models (96.24% accuracy on CIFAR-10) while
outperforming state-of-the-art interpretable models like Explainable Boosting
Machines. By combining the hierarchical expressiveness and efficient training
of deep learning with the intrinsic interpretability of well-defined
mathematical functions, CFNs offer a powerful framework for applications where
both performance and accountability are paramount.

Abstract: Predicting cognition from neuroimaging data in healthy individuals offers
insights into the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive abilities, with
potential applications in precision medicine and early detection of
neurological and psychiatric conditions. This study systematically benchmarked
classical machine learning (Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR)) and advanced deep
learning (DL) models (Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and Transformer-GNN (TGNN))
for cognitive prediction using Resting-state (RS), Working Memory, and Language
task fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project Young Adult dataset.
  Our results, based on R2 scores, Pearson correlation coefficient, and mean
absolute error, revealed that task-based fMRI, eliciting neural responses
directly tied to cognition, outperformed RS fMRI in predicting cognitive
behavior. Among the methods compared, a GNN combining structural connectivity
(SC) and functional connectivity (FC) consistently achieved the highest
performance across all fMRI modalities; however, its advantage over KRR using
FC alone was not statistically significant. The TGNN, designed to model
temporal dynamics with SC as a prior, performed competitively with FC-based
approaches for task-fMRI but struggled with RS data, where its performance
aligned with the lower-performing GNN that directly used fMRI time-series data
as node features. These findings emphasize the importance of selecting
appropriate model architectures and feature representations to fully leverage
the spatial and temporal richness of neuroimaging data.
  This study highlights the potential of multimodal graph-aware DL models to
combine SC and FC for cognitive prediction, as well as the promise of
Transformer-based approaches for capturing temporal dynamics. By providing a
comprehensive comparison of models, this work serves as a guide for advancing
brain-behavior modeling using fMRI, SC and DL.

Abstract: Recent publications have suggested using the Shapley value for anomaly
localization for sensor data systems. Using a reasonable mathematical anomaly
model for full control, experiments indicate that using a single fixed term in
the Shapley value calculation achieves a lower complexity anomaly localization

Result: 数值实验表明，改进的FMA能以更少的黑盒函数评估获得更低成本的解。

Conclusion: 限制数据集大小能有效提升FMA的优化性能。

Abstract: Black-box (BB) optimization problems aim to identify an input that minimizes
the output of a function (the BB function) whose input-output relationship is
unknown. Factorization machine with annealing (FMA) is a promising approach to
this task, employing a factorization machine (FM) as a surrogate model to
iteratively guide the solution search via an Ising machine. Although FMA has
demonstrated strong optimization performance across various applications, its
performance often stagnates as the number of optimization iterations increases.
One contributing factor to this stagnation is the growing number of data points
in the dataset used to train FM. It is hypothesized that as more data points
are accumulated, the contribution of newly added data points becomes diluted
within the entire dataset, thereby reducing their impact on improving the
prediction accuracy of FM. To address this issue, we propose a novel method for
sequential dataset construction that retains at most a specified number of the
most recently added data points. This strategy is designed to enhance the
influence of newly added data points on the surrogate model. Numerical
experiments demonstrate that the proposed FMA achieves lower-cost solutions
with fewer BB function evaluations compared to the conventional FMA.

Result: 在两个基准数据集上表现优于现有方法，验证了BFM选择的高效性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了MI-EEG解码中的挑战，提升了性能并降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Decoding motor imagery (MI) electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, a key
non-invasive brain-computer interface (BCI) paradigm for controlling external
systems, has been significantly advanced by deep learning. However, MI-EEG
decoding remains challenging due to substantial inter-subject variability and
limited labeled target data, which necessitate costly calibration for new
users. Many existing multi-source domain adaptation (MSDA) methods
indiscriminately incorporate all available source domains, disregarding the
large inter-subject differences in EEG signals, which leads to negative
transfer and excessive computational costs. Moreover, while many approaches
focus on feature distribution alignment, they often neglect the explicit
dependence between features and decision-level outputs, limiting their ability
to preserve discriminative structures. To address these gaps, we propose a
novel MSDA framework that leverages a pretrained large Brain Foundation Model
(BFM) for dynamic and informed source subject selection, ensuring only relevant
sources contribute to adaptation. Furthermore, we employ Cauchy-Schwarz (CS)
and Conditional CS (CCS) divergences to jointly perform feature-level and
decision-level alignment, enhancing domain invariance while maintaining class
discriminability. Extensive evaluations on two benchmark MI-EEG datasets
demonstrate that our framework outperforms a broad range of state-of-the-art
baselines. Additional experiments with a large source pool validate the
scalability and efficiency of BFM-guided selection, which significantly reduces
training time without sacrificing performance.

Conclusion: Transformer的数学解释揭示了其与图模型的联系，简单的图扩散步骤可提升性能。

Abstract: We propose a probabilistic interpretation of transformers as unrolled
inference steps assuming a probabilistic Laplacian Eigenmaps model from the
ProbDR framework. Our derivation shows that at initialisation, transformers
perform "linear" dimensionality reduction. We also show that within the
transformer block, a graph Laplacian term arises from our arguments, rather
than an attention matrix (which we interpret as an adjacency matrix). We
demonstrate that simply subtracting the identity from the attention matrix (and
thereby taking a graph diffusion step) improves validation performance on a

*Zedong Wang,Siyuan Li,Dan Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Rep-MTL提出了一种新的多任务学习方法，通过利用表示层任务显著性来量化任务间交互，结合熵惩罚和样本级跨任务对齐，旨在减少负迁移并促进互补信息共享。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多任务优化方法主要关注通过优化器中心策略解决任务冲突，但未能充分利用共享表示空间的互补信息。Rep-MTL探索了这一未被充分研究的领域。

Method: Rep-MTL通过表示层任务显著性量化任务交互，采用熵惩罚和样本级跨任务对齐策略，平衡任务特定学习和跨任务共享。

Result: 在四个多任务基准测试中，Rep-MTL即使与基本权重策略结合，也能实现竞争性性能提升，并通过幂律指数分析验证其平衡能力。

Conclusion: Rep-MTL通过表示层操作补充现有优化器，有效减少负迁移并促进任务互补性，为多任务学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Despite the promise of Multi-Task Learning in leveraging complementary
knowledge across tasks, existing multi-task optimization (MTO) techniques
remain fixated on resolving conflicts via optimizer-centric loss scaling and
gradient manipulation strategies, yet fail to deliver consistent gains. In this
paper, we argue that the shared representation space, where task interactions
naturally occur, offers rich information and potential for operations
complementary to existing optimizers, especially for facilitating the
inter-task complementarity, which is rarely explored in MTO. This intuition
leads to Rep-MTL, which exploits the representation-level task saliency to
quantify interactions between task-specific optimization and shared
representation learning. By steering these saliencies through entropy-based
penalization and sample-wise cross-task alignment, Rep-MTL aims to mitigate
negative transfer by maintaining the effective training of individual tasks
instead pure conflict-solving, while explicitly promoting complementary
information sharing. Experiments are conducted on four challenging MTL
benchmarks covering both task-shift and domain-shift scenarios. The results
show that Rep-MTL, even paired with the basic equal weighting policy, achieves
competitive performance gains with favorable efficiency. Beyond standard
performance metrics, Power Law exponent analysis demonstrates Rep-MTL's
efficacy in balancing task-specific learning and cross-task sharing. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Agent2Agent（A2A）协议在去中心化智能体发现和微支付方面的关键限制，推动多智能体经济的安全与可扩展性。

Method: 集成DLT技术，通过智能合约发布AgentCards，并扩展A2A协议为x402开放标准，实现基于HTTP的区块链无关微支付。

Abstract: This research article presents a novel architecture to empower multi-agent
economies by addressing two critical limitations of the emerging Agent2Agent
(A2A) communication protocol: decentralized agent discoverability and
agent-to-agent micropayments. By integrating distributed ledger technology
(DLT), this architecture enables tamper-proof, on-chain publishing of
AgentCards as smart contracts, providing secure and verifiable agent
identities. The architecture further extends A2A with the x402 open standard,
facilitating blockchain-agnostic, HTTP-based micropayments via the HTTP 402

The proposed approach lays the groundwork for secure, scalable, and
economically viable multi-agent ecosystems, advancing the field of agentic AI
toward trusted, autonomous economic interactions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究中，个体代理模型的构建常忽略记忆机制的长期累积效应，导致模型偏离真实系统特性。

Method: 采用记忆-学习协作机制，包括记忆机制的分层建模（个体记忆库、群体记忆库、记忆缓冲池）和多指标动态评估机制。

Result: 实验表明，相比现有方法，该模型构建的代理在系统内表现出更好的决策质量和适应性。

Conclusion: 该模型有效提升了人工社会建模的个体层面质量，并实现了拟人化特性。

Abstract: Many real-world systems, such as transportation systems, ecological systems,
and Internet systems, are complex systems. As an important tool for studying
complex systems, computational experiments can map them into artificial society
models that are computable and reproducible within computers, thereby providing
digital and computational methods for quantitative analysis. In current
research, the construction of individual agent models often ignores the
long-term accumulative effect of memory mechanisms in the development process
of agents, which to some extent causes the constructed models to deviate from
the real characteristics of real-world systems. To address this challenge, this
paper proposes an individual agent model based on a memory-learning
collaboration mechanism, which implements hierarchical modeling of the memory
mechanism and a multi-indicator evaluation mechanism. Through hierarchical
modeling of the individual memory repository, the group memory repository, and
the memory buffer pool, memory can be effectively managed, and knowledge
sharing and dissemination between individuals and groups can be promoted. At
the same time, the multi-indicator evaluation mechanism enables dynamic
evaluation of memory information, allowing dynamic updates of information in
the memory set and promoting collaborative decision-making between memory and
learning. Experimental results show that, compared with existing memory
modeling methods, the agents constructed by the proposed model demonstrate
better decision-making quality and adaptability within the system. This
verifies the effectiveness of the individual agent model based on the
memory-learning collaboration mechanism proposed in this paper in improving the
quality of individual-level modeling in artificial society modeling and
achieving anthropomorphic characteristics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线视频流行度预测面临时间分布漂移的挑战，传统模型因病毒趋势和用户行为变化而快速失效。

Method: 提出AMCFG框架，结合多模态聚类和LLM生成的语义锚特征（如受众画像、内容主题等），利用稳定原则而非短暂信号进行预测。

Result: 实验表明AMCFG显著提高了预测准确性和时间鲁棒性，在分布外数据上表现优异。

Conclusion: AMCFG为现实世界视频流行度预测提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Predicting online video popularity faces a critical challenge: prediction
drift, where models trained on historical data rapidly degrade due to evolving
viral trends and user behaviors. To address this temporal distribution shift,
we propose an Anchored Multi-modal Clustering and Feature Generation (AMCFG)
framework that discovers temporally-invariant patterns across data
distributions. Our approach employs multi-modal clustering to reveal content
structure, then leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate semantic
Anchor Features, such as audience demographics, content themes, and engagement
patterns that transcend superficial trend variations. These semantic anchors,
combined with cluster-derived statistical features, enable prediction based on
stable principles rather than ephemeral signals. Experiments demonstrate that
AMCFG significantly enhances both predictive accuracy and temporal robustness,
achieving superior performance on out-of-distribution data and providing a
viable solution for real-world video popularity prediction.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多条件引导的视频到音乐生成框架，通过两阶段训练策略提升音乐生成的控制性和用户期望对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频到音乐生成方法仅依赖视觉特征或文本输入，生成过程不透明且难以满足用户需求，因此需要更灵活的控制方法。

Method: 采用两阶段训练策略：第一阶段通过细粒度特征选择和时间对齐注意力机制学习基础；第二阶段通过动态条件融合和控制引导解码器模块整合多条件。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在主观和客观评估中均优于现有方法，显著提升了控制性和用户期望对齐。

Conclusion: 多条件引导框架有效解决了视频到音乐生成的灵活性和用户需求问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Music enhances video narratives and emotions, driving demand for automatic
video-to-music (V2M) generation. However, existing V2M methods relying solely
on visual features or supplementary textual inputs generate music in a
black-box manner, often failing to meet user expectations. To address this
challenge, we propose a novel multi-condition guided V2M generation framework
that incorporates multiple time-varying conditions for enhanced control over
music generation. Our method uses a two-stage training strategy that enables
learning of V2M fundamentals and audiovisual temporal synchronization while
meeting users' needs for multi-condition control. In the first stage, we
introduce a fine-grained feature selection module and a progressive temporal
alignment attention mechanism to ensure flexible feature alignment. For the
second stage, we develop a dynamic conditional fusion module and a
control-guided decoder module to integrate multiple conditions and accurately
guide the music composition process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method outperforms existing V2M pipelines in both subjective and objective
evaluations, significantly enhancing control and alignment with user
expectations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽略了实体标签的概率相关性，且静态或自适应地整合所有模态，未能排除无关或误导性信息的影响。

Method: 通过logit蒸馏训练单模态KGR模型，并引入强化教师组合机制动态选择最优多模态教师。

Result: 在5个MKGR数据集上验证了DSoM框架的有效性。

Conclusion: DSoM框架通过利用暗知识和动态模态选择，显著提升了多模态知识图谱推理的性能。

Abstract: The multimodal knowledge graph reasoning (MKGR) task aims to predict the
missing facts in the incomplete MKGs by leveraging auxiliary images and
descriptions of entities. Existing approaches are trained with single-target
objectives, which neglect the probabilistic correlations of entity labels,
especially in non-target entities. Moreover, previous studies incorporate all
modalities statically or adaptively, overlooking the negative impacts of
irrelevant or misleading information in the incompetent modalities. To address
these issues, we introduce a novel Reinforced Multimodal Distillation
framework, exploiting the Dark Side of Modalities (DSoM) from two perspectives:
(1) Dark knowledge from non-target entities: We propose to train a unimodal KGR
model through logit distillation to mimic the multimodal soft labels provided
by pre-trained multimodal teacher models. The multimodal soft labels could
provide rich supervision signals with subtle correlations among both target and
non-target entities from multiple perspectives. We further decouple logits into
neighbor entities and non-neighbor entities to divide into two types of
correlations. (2) Dark side in unhelpful modalities: To exclude the adverse
effects of unhelpful modalities, we introduce a reinforced teacher combination
mechanism that dynamically selects the optimal set of multimodal teachers for
each triple. The agent is trained to maximize the rewards, which are only
assigned to the beneficial multimodal combination strategies for the student
model. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of DSoM
framework on 5 MKGR datasets. Codes are available at github.com/OreOZhao/DSoM.

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has shown promise in discrete

unexplored, limiting its utility in robotics where continuous actions are
essential. This paper presents a theoretical framework extending GRPO to

trajectory-based policy clustering, state-aware advantage estimation, and
regularized policy updates designed for robotic applications. We provide
theoretical analysis of convergence properties and computational complexity,
establishing a foundation for future empirical validation in robotic systems
including locomotion and manipulation tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种奖励增强学习框架（RARLAP）用于自主停车（AP），通过结构化奖励设计提升策略适应性，实验表明其优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于规则和模型预测的方法在AP中缺乏适应性和泛化能力，无法应对非线性复杂环境。

Method: 设计了三种结构化奖励策略（GOR、DPR、MAR），结合策略优化方法，在高保真Unity模拟环境中训练。

Result: 实验显示，MAR策略成功率91%，轨迹更平滑，行为更鲁棒，优于其他策略。

Conclusion: RARLAP证明奖励增强能有效解决AP复杂性问题，支持策略优化的可扩展性和高效性。

Abstract: Autonomous parking (AP) represents a critical yet complex subset of
intelligent vehicle automation, characterized by tight spatial constraints,
frequent close-range obstacle interactions, and stringent safety margins.
However, conventional rule-based and model-predictive methods often lack the
adaptability and generalization needed to handle the nonlinear and
environment-dependent complexities of AP. To address these limitations, we
propose a reward-augmented learning framework for AP (RARLAP), that mitigates
the inherent complexities of continuous-domain control by leveraging structured
reward design to induce smooth and adaptable policy behavior, trained entirely
within a high-fidelity Unity-based custom 3D simulation environment. We
systematically design and assess three structured reward strategies: goal-only
reward (GOR), dense proximity reward (DPR), and milestone-augmented reward
(MAR), each integrated with both on-policy and off-policy optimization
paradigms. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the on-policy MAR achieves a
91\% success rate, yielding smoother trajectories and more robust behavior,
while GOR and DPR fail to guide effective learning. Convergence and trajectory
analyses demonstrate that the proposed framework enhances policy adaptability,
accelerates training, and improves safety in continuous control. Overall,
RARLAP establishes that reward augmentation effectively addresses complex
autonomous parking challenges, enabling scalable and efficient policy
optimization with both on- and off-policy methods. To support reproducibility,
the code accompanying this paper is publicly available.

Motivation: 模仿学习（IL）常因因果混淆问题在测试环境中表现不佳，需解决此问题以提高鲁棒性。

Method: 引入GABRIL方法，利用人类注视数据指导表示学习，通过正则化损失聚焦因果相关特征。

Result: 在Atari和CARLA实验中，GABRIL分别比行为克隆提升179%和76%，且更具可解释性。

Conclusion: GABRIL有效缓解因果混淆，显著提升模仿学习性能，并增强模型的可解释性。

Abstract: Imitation Learning (IL) is a widely adopted approach which enables agents to
learn from human expert demonstrations by framing the task as a supervised
learning problem. However, IL often suffers from causal confusion, where agents
misinterpret spurious correlations as causal relationships, leading to poor
performance in testing environments with distribution shift. To address this
issue, we introduce GAze-Based Regularization in Imitation Learning (GABRIL), a
novel method that leverages the human gaze data gathered during the data
collection phase to guide the representation learning in IL. GABRIL utilizes a
regularization loss which encourages the model to focus on causally relevant
features identified through expert gaze and consequently mitigates the effects
of confounding variables. We validate our approach in Atari environments and
the Bench2Drive benchmark in CARLA by collecting human gaze datasets and
applying our method in both domains. Experimental results show that the
improvement of GABRIL over behavior cloning is around 179% more than the same
number for other baselines in the Atari and 76% in the CARLA setup. Finally, we
show that our method provides extra explainability when compared to regular IL
agents.

Result: 在HyQReal四足机器人上验证，RAKOMO在拾取任务中优于基线KOMO方法。

Conclusion: RAKOMO有效解决了腿式机械臂的运动规划问题，适用于复杂任务。

Abstract: Legged manipulators, such as quadrupeds equipped with robotic arms, require
motion planning techniques that account for their complex kinematic constraints
in order to perform manipulation tasks both safely and effectively. However,
trajectory optimization methods often face challenges due to the hybrid
dynamics introduced by contact discontinuities, and tend to neglect leg
limitations during planning for computational reasons. In this work, we propose
RAKOMO, a path optimization technique that integrates the strengths of K-Order
Markov Optimization (KOMO) with a kinematically-aware criterion based on the
reachable region defined as reachability margin. We leverage a neural-network
to predict the margin and optimize it by incorporating it in the standard KOMO
formulation. This approach enables rapid convergence of gradient-based motion
planning -- commonly tailored for continuous systems -- while adapting it
effectively to legged manipulators, successfully executing loco-manipulation
tasks. We benchmark RAKOMO against a baseline KOMO approach through a set of
simulations for pick-and-place tasks with the HyQReal quadruped robot equipped
with a Kinova Gen3 robotic arm.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of future agent trajectories is a critical challenge for
ensuring safe and efficient autonomous navigation, particularly in complex
urban environments characterized by multiple plausible future scenarios. In
this paper, we present a novel hybrid approach that integrates learning-based
with physics-based constraints to address the multi-modality inherent in
trajectory prediction. Our method employs a variational Bayesian mixture model
to effectively capture the diverse range of potential future behaviors, moving
beyond traditional unimodal assumptions. Unlike prior approaches that
predominantly treat trajectory prediction as a data-driven regression task, our
framework incorporates physical realism through sector-specific boundary
conditions and Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based smoothing. These
constraints ensure that predicted trajectories are not only data-consistent but
also physically plausible, adhering to kinematic and dynamic principles.
Furthermore, our method produces interpretable and diverse trajectory
predictions, enabling enhanced downstream decision-making and planning in
autonomous driving systems. We evaluate our approach on two benchmark datasets,
demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods. Comprehensive
ablation studies validate the contributions of each component and highlight
their synergistic impact on prediction accuracy and reliability. By balancing
data-driven insights with physics-informed constraints, our approach offers a
robust and scalable solution for navigating the uncertainties of real-world
urban environments.

Conclusion: DOA能有效解决SLAM退化问题，并具备跨环境的泛化能力。

Abstract: Particle filter-based 2D-SLAM is widely used in indoor localization tasks due
to its efficiency. However, indoor environments such as long straight corridors
can cause severe degeneracy problems in SLAM. In this paper, we use Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO) to train an adaptive degeneracy optimization agent
(DOA) to address degeneracy problem. We propose a systematic methodology to
address three critical challenges in traditional supervised learning
frameworks: (1) data acquisition bottlenecks in degenerate dataset, (2)
inherent quality deterioration of training samples, and (3) ambiguity in
annotation protocol design. We design a specialized reward function to guide
the agent in developing perception capabilities for degenerate environments.
Using the output degeneracy factor as a reference weight, the agent can
dynamically adjust the contribution of different sensors to pose optimization.
Specifically, the observation distribution is shifted towards the motion model
distribution, with the step size determined by a linear interpolation formula
related to the degeneracy factor. In addition, we employ a transfer learning
module to endow the agent with generalization capabilities across different
environments and address the inefficiency of training in degenerate
environments. Finally, we conduct ablation studies to demonstrate the
rationality of our model design and the role of transfer learning. We also
compare the proposed DOA with SOTA methods to prove its superior degeneracy
detection and optimization capabilities across various environments.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel framework for utilizing skin sensors as a new
operation interface of complex robots. The skin sensors employed in this study
possess the capability to quantify multimodal tactile information at multiple
contact points. The time-series data generated from these sensors is
anticipated to facilitate the classification of diverse contact motions
exhibited by an operator. By mapping the classification results with robot
motion primitives, a diverse range of robot motions can be generated by
altering the manner in which the skin sensors are interacted with. In this
paper, we focus on a learning-based contact motion classifier employing
recurrent neural networks. This classifier is a pivotal factor in the success
of this framework. Furthermore, we elucidate the requisite conditions for
software-hardware designs. Firstly, multimodal sensing and its comprehensive
encoding significantly contribute to the enhancement of classification accuracy
and learning stability. Utilizing all modalities simultaneously as inputs to
the classifier proves to be an effective approach. Secondly, it is essential to
mount the skin sensors on a flexible and compliant support to enable the
activation of three-axis accelerometers. These accelerometers are capable of
measuring horizontal tactile information, thereby enhancing the correlation
with other modalities. Furthermore, they serve to absorb the noises generated
by the robot's movements during deployment. Through these discoveries, the
accuracy of the developed classifier surpassed 95 %, enabling the dual-arm
mobile manipulator to execute a diverse range of tasks via the Skin-Machine
Interface. https://youtu.be/UjUXT4Z4BC8

Method: 结合全局路径规划（考虑同伦类）和局部轨迹优化（基于模型预测控制），并采用在线重规划策略。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著减少死锁，成功率从4%-13%提升至90%以上。

Conclusion: 通过全局和局部协作，有效解决了多智能体轨迹规划中的死锁问题。

Abstract: Multi-agent trajectory planning requires ensuring both safety and efficiency,
yet deadlocks remain a significant challenge, especially in obstacle-dense
environments. Such deadlocks frequently occur when multiple agents attempt to
traverse the same long and narrow corridor simultaneously. To address this, we
propose a novel distributed trajectory planning framework that bridges the gap
between global path and local trajectory cooperation. At the global level, a
homotopy-aware optimal path planning algorithm is proposed, which fully
leverages the topological structure of the environment. A reference path is
chosen from distinct homotopy classes by considering both its spatial and
temporal properties, leading to improved coordination among agents globally. At
the local level, a model predictive control-based trajectory optimization
method is used to generate dynamically feasible and collision-free
trajectories. Additionally, an online replanning strategy ensures its
adaptability to dynamic environments. Simulations and experiments validate the
effectiveness of our approach in mitigating deadlocks. Ablation studies
demonstrate that by incorporating time-aware homotopic properties into the
underlying global paths, our method can significantly reduce deadlocks and
improve the average success rate from 4%-13% to over 90% in randomly generated
dense scenarios.

Abstract: Bimanual manipulation, fundamental to human daily activities, remains a
challenging task due to its inherent complexity of coordinated control. Recent
advances have enabled zero-shot learning of single-arm manipulation skills
through agent-agnostic visual representations derived from human videos;
however, these methods overlook crucial agent-specific information necessary
for bimanual coordination, such as end-effector positions. We propose Ag2x2, a
computational framework for bimanual manipulation through coordination-aware
visual representations that jointly encode object states and hand motion
patterns while maintaining agent-agnosticism. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that Ag2x2 achieves a 73.5% success rate across 13 diverse bimanual tasks from
Bi-DexHands and PerAct2, including challenging scenarios with deformable
objects like ropes. This performance outperforms baseline methods and even
surpasses the success rate of policies trained with expert-engineered rewards.
Furthermore, we show that representations learned through Ag2x2 can be
effectively leveraged for imitation learning, establishing a scalable pipeline
for skill acquisition without expert supervision. By maintaining robust
performance across diverse tasks without human demonstrations or engineered
rewards, Ag2x2 represents a step toward scalable learning of complex bimanual
robotic skills.

Abstract: 4D imaging radar is a type of low-cost millimeter-wave radar(costing merely
10-20$\%$ of lidar systems) capable of providing range, azimuth, elevation, and
Doppler velocity information. Accurate extrinsic calibration between
millimeter-wave radar and camera systems is critical for robust multimodal
perception in robotics, yet remains challenging due to inherent sensor noise
characteristics and complex error propagation. This paper presents a systematic
calibration framework to address critical challenges through a spatial 3d
uncertainty-aware PnP algorithm (3DUPnP) that explicitly models spherical
coordinate noise propagation in radar measurements, then compensating for
non-zero error expectations during coordinate transformations. Finally,
experimental validation demonstrates significant performance improvements over
state-of-the-art CPnP baseline, including improved consistency in simulations
and enhanced precision in physical experiments. This study provides a robust
calibration solution for robotic systems equipped with millimeter-wave radar
and cameras, tailored specifically for autonomous driving and robotic
perception applications.

Abstract: In many applications, robots are increasingly deployed in unstructured and
natural environments where they encounter various types of vegetation.
Vegetation presents unique challenges as a traversable obstacle, where the
mechanical properties of the plants can influence whether a robot can safely
collide with and overcome the obstacle. A more nuanced approach is required to
assess the safety and traversability of these obstacles, as collisions can
sometimes be safe and necessary for navigating through dense or unavoidable
vegetation. This paper introduces a novel sensor designed to directly measure
the applied forces exerted by vegetation on a robot: by directly capturing the
push-back forces, our sensor provides a detailed understanding of the
interactions between the robot and its surroundings. We demonstrate the
sensor's effectiveness through experimental validations, showcasing its ability
to measure subtle force variations. This force-based approach provides a
quantifiable metric that can inform navigation decisions and serve as a
foundation for developing future learning algorithms.

TL;DR: PlaneHEC是一种通用的手眼标定方法，无需复杂模型，仅需深度相机即可完成，利用任意平面表面实现最优且最快的标定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖精确几何模型或人工辅助，泛化性差且复杂低效，因此需要一种更通用、高效的标定方法。

Method: 基于平面约束的手眼标定方程，结合闭式解和迭代优化，提高精度。

Result: 在仿真和真实环境中验证了PlaneHEC的优越性，相比其他点云标定方法表现更优。

Conclusion: PlaneHEC通过创新的计算模型设计，实现了通用且快速的标定，为多智能体系统和具身智能发展做出贡献。

Abstract: Hand-eye calibration is an important task in vision-guided robotic systems
and is crucial for determining the transformation matrix between the camera
coordinate system and the robot end-effector. Existing methods, for multi-view
robotic systems, usually rely on accurate geometric models or manual
assistance, generalize poorly, and can be very complicated and inefficient.
Therefore, in this study, we propose PlaneHEC, a generalized hand-eye
calibration method that does not require complex models and can be accomplished
using only depth cameras, which achieves the optimal and fastest calibration
results using arbitrary planar surfaces like walls and tables. PlaneHEC
introduces hand-eye calibration equations based on planar constraints, which
makes it strongly interpretable and generalizable. PlaneHEC also uses a
comprehensive solution that starts with a closed-form solution and improves it
withiterative optimization, which greatly improves accuracy. We comprehensively
evaluated the performance of PlaneHEC in both simulated and real-world
environments and compared the results with other point-cloud-based calibration
methods, proving its superiority. Our approach achieves universal and fast
calibration with an innovative design of computational models, providing a
strong contribution to the development of multi-agent systems and embodied
intelligence.

TL;DR: 论文提出“Think, Act, Learn”（T-A-L）框架，通过闭环学习提升机器人在动态环境中的适应能力，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于大语言模型（LLM）的机器人系统多为开环规划，无法适应动态环境中的突发情况，限制了其鲁棒性和适应性。

Method: T-A-L框架通过“思考-行动-学习”闭环循环，利用LLM分解任务、执行计划并基于反馈进行自我反思和策略优化。

Result: 实验表明，T-A-L框架在复杂任务中成功率超过97%，仅需9次试验即可稳定收敛，且能泛化到未见任务。

Conclusion: T-A-L框架为开发更鲁棒、自适应和真正自主的机器人系统迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into robotics has unlocked
unprecedented capabilities in high-level task planning. However, most current
systems operate in an open-loop fashion, where LLMs act as one-shot planners,
rendering them brittle and unable to adapt to unforeseen circumstances in
dynamic physical environments. To overcome this limitation, this paper
introduces the "Think, Act, Learn" (T-A-L) framework, a novel architecture that
enables an embodied agent to autonomously learn and refine its policies through
continuous interaction. Our framework establishes a closed-loop cycle where an
LLM first "thinks" by decomposing high-level commands into actionable plans.
The robot then "acts" by executing these plans while gathering rich, multimodal
sensory feedback. Critically, the "learn" module processes this feedback to
facilitate LLM-driven self-reflection, allowing the agent to perform causal
analysis on its failures and generate corrective strategies. These insights are
stored in an experiential memory to guide future planning cycles. We
demonstrate through extensive experiments in both simulation and the real world
that our T-A-L agent significantly outperforms baseline methods, including
open-loop LLMs, Behavioral Cloning, and traditional Reinforcement Learning. Our
framework achieves over a 97% success rate on complex, long-horizon tasks,
converges to a stable policy in an average of just 9 trials, and exhibits
remarkable generalization to unseen tasks. This work presents a significant
step towards developing more robust, adaptive, and truly autonomous robotic
agents.

Result: 框架能够生成多样化和真实的测试数据集，提高验证效率和可访问性。

Conclusion: 该框架简化了场景生成流程，支持更广泛的用户群体，提升了自动驾驶验证的效率和实用性。

Abstract: Autonomous driving promises safer roads, reduced congestion, and improved
mobility, yet validating these systems across diverse conditions remains a
major challenge. Real-world testing is expensive, time-consuming, and sometimes
unsafe, making large-scale validation impractical. In contrast, simulation
environments offer a scalable and cost-effective alternative for rigorous
verification and validation. A critical component of the validation process is
scenario generation, which involves designing and configuring traffic scenarios
to evaluate autonomous systems' responses to various events and uncertainties.
However, existing scenario generation tools often require programming
knowledge, limiting accessibility for non-technical users. To address this
limitation, we present an interactive, no-code framework for scenario
generation. Our framework features a graphical interface that enables users to
create, modify, save, load, and execute scenarios without needing coding
expertise or detailed simulation knowledge. Unlike script-based tools such as
Scenic or ScenarioRunner, our approach lowers the barrier to entry and supports
a broader user base. Central to our framework is a graph-based scenario
representation that facilitates structured management, supports both manual and
automated generation, and enables integration with deep learning-based scenario
and behavior generation methods. In automated mode, the framework can randomly
sample parameters such as actor types, behaviors, and environmental conditions,
allowing the generation of diverse and realistic test datasets. By simplifying
the scenario generation process, this framework supports more efficient testing
workflows and increases the accessibility of simulation-based validation for
researchers, engineers, and policymakers.

Method: 采用神经形态相机和滚动机制，结合事件驱动的多视角立体视觉方法进行3D重建，并使用贝叶斯融合策略提高精度。

Result: 扫描速度达到0.5 m/s，平均绝对误差低于100微米，比现有方法快11倍，精度提高25.2%。

Conclusion: 新方法显著提升了扫描速度和精度，适用于工业表面检测等应用。

Abstract: Inspecting large-scale industrial surfaces like aircraft fuselages for
quality control requires capturing their precise 3D surface geometry at high
resolution. Vision-based tactile sensors (VBTSs) offer high local resolution
but require slow 'press-and-lift' measurements stitched for large areas.
Approaches with sliding or roller/belt VBTS designs provide measurements
continuity. However, they face significant challenges respectively: sliding
struggles with friction/wear and both approaches are speed-limited by
conventional camera frame rates and motion blur, making large-area scanning
time consuming. Thus, a rapid, continuous, high-resolution method is needed. We
introduce a novel tactile sensor integrating a neuromorphic camera in a rolling
mechanism to achieve this. Leveraging its high temporal resolution and
robustness to motion blur, our system uses a modified event-based multi-view
stereo approach for 3D reconstruction. We demonstrate state-of-the-art scanning
speeds up to 0.5 m/s, achieving Mean Absolute Error below 100 microns -- 11
times faster than prior continuous tactile sensing methods. A multi-reference
Bayesian fusion strategy enhances accuracy (reducing MAE by 25.2\% compared to
EMVS) and mitigates curvature errors. We also validate high-speed feature
recognition via Braille reading 2.6 times faster than previous approaches.

Conclusion: FP-LGN成功实现了不确定性感知的异构信息融合，提升了人机协作任务的表现。

Abstract: Fusing information from human observations can help robots overcome sensing
limitations in collaborative tasks. However, an uncertainty-aware fusion
framework requires a grounded likelihood representing the uncertainty of human
inputs. This paper presents a Feature Pyramid Likelihood Grounding Network
(FP-LGN) that grounds spatial language by learning relevant map image features
and their relationships with spatial relation semantics. The model is trained
as a probability estimator to capture aleatoric uncertainty in human language
using three-stage curriculum learning. Results showed that FP-LGN matched
expert-designed rules in mean Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL) and demonstrated
greater robustness with lower standard deviation. Collaborative sensing results
demonstrated that the grounded likelihood successfully enabled
uncertainty-aware fusion of heterogeneous human language observations and robot
sensor measurements, achieving significant improvements in human-robot
collaborative task performance.

Abstract: AI technologies, including deep learning, large-language models have gone
from one breakthrough to the other. As a result, we are witnessing growing
excitement in robotics at the prospect of leveraging the potential of AI to
tackle some of the outstanding barriers to the full deployment of robots in our
daily lives. However, action and sensing in the physical world pose greater and
different challenges than analysing data in isolation. As the development and
application of AI in robotic products advances, it is important to reflect on
which technologies, among the vast array of network architectures and learning
models now available in the AI field, are most likely to be successfully
applied to robots; how they can be adapted to specific robot designs, tasks,
environments; which challenges must be overcome. This article offers an
assessment of what AI for robotics has achieved since the 1990s and proposes a
short- and medium-term research roadmap listing challenges and promises. These
range from keeping up-to-date large datasets, representatives of a diversity of
tasks robots may have to perform, and of environments they may encounter, to
designing AI algorithms tailored specifically to robotics problems but generic
enough to apply to a wide range of applications and transfer easily to a
variety of robotic platforms. For robots to collaborate effectively with
humans, they must predict human behavior without relying on bias-based
profiling. Explainability and transparency in AI-driven robot control are not
optional but essential for building trust, preventing misuse, and attributing
responsibility in accidents. We close on what we view as the primary long-term
challenges, that is, to design robots capable of lifelong learning, while
guaranteeing safe deployment and usage, and sustainable computational costs.

Conclusion: CLASP通过语义关键点实现了通用衣物操作，为家庭服务机器人提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Clothes manipulation, such as folding or hanging, is a critical capability
for home service robots. Despite recent advances, most existing methods remain
limited to specific tasks and clothes types, due to the complex,
high-dimensional geometry of clothes. This paper presents CLothes mAnipulation
with Semantic keyPoints (CLASP), which aims at general-purpose clothes
manipulation over different clothes types, T-shirts, shorts, skirts, long
dresses, ... , as well as different tasks, folding, flattening, hanging, ... .
The core idea of CLASP is semantic keypoints -- e.g., ''left sleeve'', ''right
shoulder'', etc. -- a sparse spatial-semantic representation that is salient
for both perception and action. Semantic keypoints of clothes can be reliably
extracted from RGB-D images and provide an effective intermediate
representation of clothes manipulation policies. CLASP uses semantic keypoints
to bridge high-level task planning and low-level action execution. At the high
level, it exploits vision language models (VLMs) to predict task plans over the
semantic keypoints. At the low level, it executes the plans with the help of a
simple pre-built manipulation skill library. Extensive simulation experiments
show that CLASP outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods on multiple tasks
across diverse clothes types, demonstrating strong performance and
generalization. Further experiments with a Franka dual-arm system on four
distinct tasks -- folding, flattening, hanging, and placing -- confirm CLASP's
performance on a real robot.

Conclusion: 颗粒材料的初始条件对机器人操作效果有重要影响，未来研究应进一步探索机器人与纠缠材料的交互机制。

Abstract: Construction throughout history typically assumes that its blueprints and
building blocks are pre-determined. However, recent work suggests that
alternative approaches can enable new paradigms for structure formation.
Aleatory architectures, or those which rely on the properties of their granular
building blocks rather than pre-planned design or computation, have thus far
relied on human intervention for their creation. We imagine that robotic swarms
could be valuable to create such aleatory structures by manipulating and
forming structures from entangled granular materials. To discover principles by
which robotic systems can effectively manipulate soft matter, we develop a
robophysical model for interaction with geometrically cohesive granular media
composed of u-shape particles. This robotic platform uses environmental signals
to autonomously coordinate excavation, transport, and deposition of material.
We test the effect of substrate initial conditions by characterizing robot
performance in two different material compaction states and observe as much as
a 75% change in transported mass depending on initial substrate compressive
loading. These discrepancies suggest the functional role that material
properties such as packing and cohesion/entanglement play in excavation and
construction. To better understand these material properties, we develop an
apparatus for tensile testing of the geometrically cohesive substrates, which
reveals how entangled material strength responds strongly to initial
compressive loading. These results explain the variation observed in robotic
performance and point to future directions for better understanding robotic
interaction mechanics with entangled materials.

Abstract: Magnetic-based tactile sensors (MBTS) combine the advantages of compact
design and high-frequency operation but suffer from limited spatial resolution
due to their sparse taxel arrays. This paper proposes SuperMag, a tactile shape
reconstruction method that addresses this limitation by leveraging
high-resolution vision-based tactile sensor (VBTS) data to supervise MBTS
super-resolution. Co-designed, open-source VBTS and MBTS with identical contact
modules enable synchronized data collection of high-resolution shapes and
magnetic signals via a symmetric calibration setup. We frame tactile shape
reconstruction as a conditional generative problem, employing a conditional
variational auto-encoder to infer high-resolution shapes from low-resolution
MBTS inputs. The MBTS achieves a sampling frequency of 125 Hz, whereas the
shape reconstruction sustains an inference time within 2.5 ms. This
cross-modality synergy advances tactile perception of the MBTS, potentially
unlocking its new capabilities in high-precision robotic tasks.

Motivation: 研究LLM在目标导航中的实际贡献，验证其是否真正提升了规划能力。

Method: 移除InstructNav的复杂组件，替换为简单的几何启发式方法（DWFE），并加入轻量级语言先验（SHF）。

Result: DWFE显著提升了成功率（58.0%到61.1%）和路径效率（SPL从20.9%到36.0%），SHF进一步优化了性能。

Conclusion: 几何启发式方法而非LLM推理是性能提升的主要原因，未来需结合度量感知提示或离线语义图才能体现LLM的智能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often credited with recent leaps in
ObjectGoal Navigation, yet the extent to which they improve planning remains
unclear. We revisit this question on the HM3D-v1 validation split. First, we
strip InstructNav of its Dynamic Chain-of-Navigation prompt, open-vocabulary
GLEE detector and Intuition saliency map, and replace them with a simple
Distance-Weighted Frontier Explorer (DWFE). This geometry-only heuristic raises
Success from 58.0% to 61.1% and lifts SPL from 20.9% to 36.0% over 2 000
validation episodes, outperforming all previous training-free baselines.
Second, we add a lightweight language prior (SHF); on a 200-episode subset this
yields a further +2% Success and +0.9% SPL while shortening paths by five steps
on average. Qualitative trajectories confirm the trend: InstructNav back-tracks
and times-out, DWFE reaches the goal after a few islands, and SHF follows an
almost straight route. Our results indicate that frontier geometry, not
emergent LLM reasoning, drives most reported gains, and suggest that
metric-aware prompts or offline semantic graphs are necessary before
attributing navigation success to "LLM intelligence."

Abstract: In spacecraft Rendezvous, Proximity Operations (RPO), and Formation Flying
(FF), the Guidance Navigation and Control (GNC) system is safety-critical and
must meet strict performance requirements. However, validating such systems is
challenging due to the complexity of the space environment, necessitating a
verification and validation (V&V) process that bridges simulation and
real-world behavior. The key contribution of this paper is a unified,
end-to-end digital and robotic twinning framework that enables software- and
hardware-in-the-loop testing for multi-modal GNC systems. The robotic twin
includes three testbeds at Stanford's Space Rendezvous Laboratory (SLAB): the
GNSS and Radiofrequency Autonomous Navigation Testbed for Distributed Space
Systems (GRAND) to validate RF-based navigation techniques, and the Testbed for
Rendezvous and Optical Navigation (TRON) and Optical Stimulator (OS) to
validate vision-based methods. The test article for this work is an integrated
multi-modal GNC software stack for RPO and FF developed at SLAB. This paper
introduces the hybrid framework and summarizes calibration and error
characterization for the robotic twin. Then, the GNC stack's performance and
robustness is characterized using the integrated digital and robotic twinning
pipeline for a full-range RPO mission scenario in Low-Earth Orbit (LEO). The
results shown in the paper demonstrate consistency between digital and robotic
twins, validating the hybrid twinning pipeline as a reliable framework for
realistic assessment and verification of GNC systems.

Abstract: Musculoskeletal modeling and simulations enable the accurate description and
analysis of the movement of biological systems with applications such as
rehabilitation assessment, prosthesis, and exoskeleton design. However, the
widespread usage of these techniques is limited by costly sensors,
laboratory-based setups, computationally demanding processes, and the use of
diverse software tools that often lack seamless integration. In this work, we
address these limitations by proposing an integrated, real-time framework for
musculoskeletal modeling and simulations that leverages OpenSimRT, the robotics
operating system (ROS), and wearable sensors. As a proof-of-concept, we
demonstrate that this framework can reasonably well describe inverse kinematics
of both lower and upper body using either inertial measurement units or
fiducial markers. Additionally, we show that it can effectively estimate
inverse dynamics of the ankle joint and muscle activations of major lower limb
muscles during daily activities, including walking, squatting and sit to stand,
stand to sit when combined with pressure insoles. We believe this work lays the
groundwork for further studies with more complex real-time and wearable

Abstract: Humanoid robot technology is advancing rapidly, with manufacturers
introducing diverse heterogeneous visual perception modules tailored to
specific scenarios. Among various perception paradigms, occupancy-based
representation has become widely recognized as particularly suitable for
humanoid robots, as it provides both rich semantic and 3D geometric information
essential for comprehensive environmental understanding. In this work, we
present Humanoid Occupancy, a generalized multimodal occupancy perception
system that integrates hardware and software components, data acquisition
devices, and a dedicated annotation pipeline. Our framework employs advanced
multi-modal fusion techniques to generate grid-based occupancy outputs encoding
both occupancy status and semantic labels, thereby enabling holistic
environmental understanding for downstream tasks such as task planning and
navigation. To address the unique challenges of humanoid robots, we overcome
issues such as kinematic interference and occlusion, and establish an effective
sensor layout strategy. Furthermore, we have developed the first panoramic
occupancy dataset specifically for humanoid robots, offering a valuable
benchmark and resource for future research and development in this domain. The
network architecture incorporates multi-modal feature fusion and temporal
information integration to ensure robust perception. Overall, Humanoid
Occupancy delivers effective environmental perception for humanoid robots and
establishes a technical foundation for standardizing universal visual modules,
paving the way for the widespread deployment of humanoid robots in complex
real-world scenarios.

Motivation: 解决肋间超声成像中因声窗受限而缺乏有效扫描路径生成方法的问题。

Method: 利用触觉信号提取肋骨表面点云，通过稀疏点云插值和配准生成扫描路径，并引入自动倾斜角调整方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提高了肋间超声成像的准确性和效率，具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Medical ultrasound (US) imaging is widely used in clinical examinations due
to its portability, real-time capability, and radiation-free nature. To address
inter- and intra-operator variability, robotic ultrasound systems have gained
increasing attention. However, their application in challenging intercostal
imaging remains limited due to the lack of an effective scan path generation
method within the constrained acoustic window. To overcome this challenge, we
explore the potential of tactile cues for characterizing subcutaneous rib
structures as an alternative signal for ultrasound segmentation-free bone
surface point cloud extraction. Compared to 2D US images, 1D tactile-related
signals offer higher processing efficiency and are less susceptible to acoustic
noise and artifacts. By leveraging robotic tracking data, a sparse tactile
point cloud is generated through a few scans along the rib, mimicking human
palpation. To robustly map the scanning trajectory into the intercostal space,
the sparse tactile bone location point cloud is first interpolated to form a
denser representation. This refined point cloud is then registered to an
image-based dense bone surface point cloud, enabling accurate scan path mapping
for individual patients. Additionally, to ensure full coverage of the object of
interest, we introduce an automated tilt angle adjustment method to visualize
structures beneath the bone. To validate the proposed method, we conducted
comprehensive experiments on four distinct phantoms. The final scanning
waypoint mapping achieved Mean Nearest Neighbor Distance (MNND) and Hausdorff
distance (HD) errors of 3.41 mm and 3.65 mm, respectively, while the
reconstructed object beneath the bone had errors of 0.69 mm and 2.2 mm compared
to the CT ground truth.

Conclusion: 方法实用且高效，适用于实际机器人平台。

Abstract: Decentralized multi-agent navigation under uncertainty is a complex task that
arises in numerous robotic applications. It requires collision avoidance
strategies that account for both kinematic constraints, sensing and action
execution noise. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that integrates the
Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) with a probabilistic adaptation of
Optimal Reciprocal Collision Avoidance. Our method ensures safe and efficient
multi-agent navigation by incorporating probabilistic safety constraints
directly into the MPPI sampling process via a Second-Order Cone Programming
formulation. This approach enables agents to operate independently using local
noisy observations while maintaining safety guarantees. We validate our
algorithm through extensive simulations with differential-drive robots and
benchmark it against state-of-the-art methods, including ORCA-DD and B-UAVC.
Results demonstrate that our approach outperforms them while achieving high
success rates, even in densely populated environments. Additionally, validation
in the Gazebo simulator confirms its practical applicability to robotic
platforms.

Conclusion: 知识图谱和RAG系统是提升水下机器人自主性和人机协作的关键技术。

Abstract: Robotic platforms have become essential for marine operations by providing
regular and continuous access to offshore assets, such as underwater
infrastructure inspection, environmental monitoring, and resource exploration.
However, the complex and dynamic nature of underwater environments,
characterized by limited visibility, unpredictable currents, and communication
constraints, presents significant challenges that demand advanced autonomy
while ensuring operator trust and oversight. Central to addressing these
challenges are knowledge representation and reasoning techniques, particularly
knowledge graphs and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, that enable
robots to efficiently structure, retrieve, and interpret complex environmental
data. These capabilities empower robotic agents to reason, adapt, and respond
effectively to changing conditions. The primary goal of this work is to
demonstrate both multi-agent autonomy and shared autonomy, where multiple
robotic agents operate independently while remaining connected to a human
supervisor. We show how a RAG-powered large language model, augmented with
knowledge graph data and domain taxonomy, enables autonomous multi-agent
decision-making and facilitates seamless human-robot interaction, resulting in
100\% mission validation and behavior completeness. Finally, ablation studies
reveal that without structured knowledge from the graph and/or taxonomy, the
LLM is prone to hallucinations, which can compromise decision quality.

Abstract: Loco-manipulation of quadrupedal robots has broadened robotic applications,
but using legs as manipulators often compromises locomotion, while mounting
arms complicates the system. To mitigate this issue, we introduce bipedalism
for quadrupedal robots, thus freeing the front legs for versatile interactions
with the environment. We propose a risk-adaptive distributional Reinforcement
Learning (RL) framework designed for quadrupedal robots walking on their hind
legs, balancing worst-case conservativeness with optimal performance in this
inherently unstable task. During training, the adaptive risk preference is
dynamically adjusted based on the uncertainty of the return, measured by the
coefficient of variation of the estimated return distribution. Extensive
experiments in simulation show our method's superior performance over
baselines. Real-world deployment on a Unitree Go2 robot further demonstrates
the versatility of our policy, enabling tasks like cart pushing, obstacle
probing, and payload transport, while showcasing robustness against challenging
dynamics and external disturbances.

Abstract: Autonomous racing has gained increasing attention in recent years, as a safe
environment to accelerate the development of motion planning and control
methods for autonomous driving. Deep learning models, predominantly based on
neural networks (NNs), have demonstrated significant potential in modeling the
vehicle dynamics and in performing various tasks in autonomous driving.
However, their black-box nature is critical in the context of autonomous
racing, where safety and robustness demand a thorough understanding of the
decision-making algorithms. To address this challenge, this paper proposes
MS-NN-steer, a new Model-Structured Neural Network for vehicle steering
control, integrating the prior knowledge of the nonlinear vehicle dynamics into
the neural architecture. The proposed controller is validated using real-world
data from the Abu Dhabi Autonomous Racing League (A2RL) competition, with
full-scale autonomous race cars. In comparison with general-purpose NNs,
MS-NN-steer is shown to achieve better accuracy and generalization with small
training datasets, while being less sensitive to the weights' initialization.
Also, MS-NN-steer outperforms the steering controller used by the A2RL winning
team. Our implementation is available open-source in a GitHub repository.

Result: 在多种智能体和交互场景（如格斗、握手、舞蹈等）中验证了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 为形态差异大的智能体之间的协调行为提供了一条有前景的路径。

Abstract: Learning physical interaction skills, such as dancing, handshaking, or
sparring, remains a fundamental challenge for agents operating in human
environments, particularly when the agent's morphology differs significantly
from that of the demonstrator. Existing approaches often rely on handcrafted
objectives or morphological similarity, limiting their capacity for
generalization. Here, we introduce a framework that enables agents with diverse
embodiments to learn wholebbody interaction behaviors directly from human
demonstrations. The framework extracts a compact, transferable representation
of interaction dynamics, called the Embedded Interaction Graph (EIG), which
captures key spatiotemporal relationships between the interacting agents. This
graph is then used as an imitation objective to train control policies in
physics-based simulations, allowing the agent to generate motions that are both
semantically meaningful and physically feasible. We demonstrate BuddyImitation
on multiple agents, such as humans, quadrupedal robots with manipulators, or
mobile manipulators and various interaction scenarios, including sparring,
handshaking, rock-paper-scissors, or dancing. Our results demonstrate a
promising path toward coordinated behaviors across morphologically distinct
characters via cross embodiment interaction learning.

Conclusion: 该研究为LLM在自动控制领域的应用开辟了新方向，提供了更高的实用性和部署潜力。

Abstract: With rapid advances in code generation, reasoning, and problem-solving, Large
Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in robotics. Most existing work
focuses on high-level tasks such as task decomposition. A few studies have
explored the use of LLMs in feedback controller design; however, these efforts
are restricted to overly simplified systems, fixed-structure gain tuning, and
lack real-world validation. To further investigate LLMs in automatic control,
this work targets a key subfield: adaptive control. Inspired by the framework
of model reference adaptive control (MRAC), we propose an LLM-guided adaptive
compensator framework that avoids designing controllers from scratch. Instead,
the LLMs are prompted using the discrepancies between an unknown system and a
reference system to design a compensator that aligns the response of the
unknown system with that of the reference, thereby achieving adaptivity.
Experiments evaluate five methods: LLM-guided adaptive compensator, LLM-guided
adaptive controller, indirect adaptive control, learning-based adaptive
control, and MRAC, on soft and humanoid robots in both simulated and real-world
environments. Results show that the LLM-guided adaptive compensator outperforms
traditional adaptive controllers and significantly reduces reasoning complexity
compared to the LLM-guided adaptive controller. The Lyapunov-based analysis and
reasoning-path inspection demonstrate that the LLM-guided adaptive compensator
enables a more structured design process by transforming mathematical
derivation into a reasoning task, while exhibiting strong generalizability,
adaptability, and robustness. This study opens a new direction for applying
LLMs in the field of automatic control, offering greater deployability and
practicality compared to vision-language models.

Abstract: The unification of disparate maps is crucial for enabling scalable robot
operation across multiple sessions and collaborative multi-robot scenarios.
However, achieving a unified map robust to sensor modalities and dynamic
environments remains a challenging problem. Variations in LiDAR types and
dynamic elements lead to differences in point cloud distribution and scene
consistency, hindering reliable descriptor generation and loop closure
detection essential for accurate map alignment. To address these challenges,
this paper presents Uni-Mapper, a dynamic-aware 3D point cloud map merging
framework for multi-modal LiDAR systems. It comprises dynamic object removal,
dynamic-aware loop closure, and multi-modal LiDAR map merging modules. A
voxel-wise free space hash map is built in a coarse-to-fine manner to identify
and reject dynamic objects via temporal occupancy inconsistencies. The removal
module is integrated with a LiDAR global descriptor, which encodes preserved
static local features to ensure robust place recognition in dynamic
environments. In the final stage, multiple pose graph optimizations are
conducted for both intra-session and inter-map loop closures. We adopt a
centralized anchor-node strategy to mitigate intra-session drift errors during
map merging. In the final stage, centralized anchor-node-based pose graph
optimization is performed to address intra- and inter-map loop closures for
globally consistent map merging. Our framework is evaluated on diverse
real-world datasets with dynamic objects and heterogeneous LiDARs, showing
superior performance in loop detection across sensor modalities, robust mapping
in dynamic environments, and accurate multi-map alignment over existing
methods. Project Page: https://sparolab.github.io/research/uni_mapper.

Conclusion: 研究展示了分析和深度学习方法在复杂桁架环境中的潜力，并权衡了计算效率和分割性能，为未来自主基础设施检查提供了指导。

Abstract: Reticular structures form the backbone of major infrastructure like bridges,
pylons, and airports, but their inspection and maintenance are costly and
hazardous, often requiring human intervention. While prior research has focused
on fault detection via images or robotic platform design, the autonomous
navigation of robots within these structures is less explored. This study
addresses that gap by proposing methods to detect navigable surfaces in truss
structures, enhancing the autonomy of climbing robots. The paper introduces
several approaches for binary segmentation of navigable surfaces versus
background from 3D point clouds of metallic trusses. These methods fall into
two categories: analytical algorithms and deep learning models. The analytical
approach features a custom algorithm that segments structures by analyzing the
eigendecomposition of planar patches in the point cloud. In parallel, advanced
deep learning models PointNet, PointNet++, MinkUNet34C, and PointTransformerV3
are trained and evaluated for the same task. Comparative analysis shows that
the analytical algorithm offers easier parameter tuning and performance
comparable to deep learning models, which, while more computationally
intensive, excel in segmentation accuracy. Notably, PointTransformerV3 achieves
a Mean Intersection Over Union (mIoU) of about 97%. The study demonstrates the
promise of both analytical and deep learning methods for improving autonomous
navigation in complex truss environments. The results highlight the trade-offs
between computational efficiency and segmentation performance, providing
valuable guidance for future research and practical applications in autonomous
infrastructure inspection and maintenance.

Abstract: Visual imitation learning (VIL) provides an efficient and intuitive strategy
for robotic systems to acquire novel skills. Recent advancements in foundation
models, particularly Vision Language Models (VLMs), have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in visual and linguistic reasoning for VIL tasks.
Despite this progress, existing approaches primarily utilize these models for
learning high-level plans from human demonstrations, relying on pre-defined
motion primitives for executing physical interactions, which remains a major
bottleneck for robotic systems. In this work, we present FMimic, a novel
paradigm that harnesses foundation models to directly learn generalizable
skills at even fine-grained action levels, using only a limited number of human
videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our FMimic delivers strong
performance with a single human video, and significantly outperforms all other
methods with five videos. Furthermore, our method exhibits significant
improvements of over 39% and 29% in RLBench multi-task experiments and
real-world manipulation tasks, respectively, and exceeds baselines by more than
34% in high-precision tasks and 47% in long-horizon tasks.

Abstract: Situationally-aware artificial agents operating with competence in natural
environments face several challenges: spatial awareness, object affordance
detection, dynamic changes and unpredictability. A critical challenge is the
agent's ability to identify and monitor environmental elements pertinent to its
objectives. Our research introduces a neurosymbolic modular architecture for
reactive robotics. Our system combines a neural component performing object
recognition over the environment and image processing techniques such as
optical flow, with symbolic representation and reasoning. The reasoning system
is grounded in the embodied cognition paradigm, via integrating image schematic
knowledge in an ontological structure. The ontology is operatively used to
create queries for the perception system, decide on actions, and infer
entities' capabilities derived from perceptual data. The combination of
reasoning and image processing allows the agent to focus its perception for
normal operation as well as discover new concepts for parts of objects involved
in particular interactions. The discovered concepts allow the robot to
autonomously acquire training data and adjust its subsymbolic perception to
recognize the parts, as well as making planning for more complex tasks feasible
by focusing search on those relevant object parts. We demonstrate our approach
in a simulated world, in which an agent learns to recognize parts of objects
involved in support relations. While the agent has no concept of handle
initially, by observing examples of supported objects hanging from a hook it
learns to recognize the parts involved in establishing support and becomes able
to plan the establishment/destruction of the support relation. This underscores
the agent's capability to expand its knowledge through observation in a
systematic way, and illustrates the potential of combining deep reasoning

*Meiting Dang,Yanping Wu,Yafei Wang,Dezong Zhao,David Flynn,Chongfeng Wei*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于自由能原理的框架，用于改进自动驾驶车辆与行人的交互，提升安全性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自动驾驶车辆在复杂多代理环境中与弱势道路用户（如行人）交互时预测和决策的挑战。

Method: 结合自由能原理的认知过程建模，提出行人认知风险社会力模型和动态风险感知图卷积网络。

Result: 仿真结果表明，框架在安全性、效率和导航平滑性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 新框架为自动驾驶车辆与行人的交互提供了更真实和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in autonomous vehicle (AV) behavior planning have shown
impressive social interaction capabilities when interacting with other road
users. However, achieving human-like prediction and decision-making in
interactions with vulnerable road users remains a key challenge in complex
multi-agent interactive environments. Existing research focuses primarily on
crowd navigation for small mobile robots, which cannot be directly applied to
AVs due to inherent differences in their decision-making strategies and dynamic
boundaries. Moreover, pedestrians in these multi-agent simulations follow fixed
behavior patterns that cannot dynamically respond to AV actions. To overcome
these limitations, this paper proposes a novel framework for modeling
interactions between the AV and multiple pedestrians. In this framework, a
cognitive process modeling approach inspired by the Free Energy Principle is
integrated into both the AV and pedestrian models to simulate more realistic
interaction dynamics. Specifically, the proposed pedestrian Cognitive-Risk
Social Force Model adjusts goal-directed and repulsive forces using a fused
measure of cognitive uncertainty and physical risk to produce human-like
trajectories. Meanwhile, the AV leverages this fused risk to construct a
dynamic, risk-aware adjacency matrix for a Graph Convolutional Network within a
Soft Actor-Critic architecture, allowing it to make more reasonable and
informed decisions. Simulation results indicate that our proposed framework
effectively improves safety, efficiency, and smoothness of AV navigation
compared to the state-of-the-art method.

Motivation: 物理仿真和学习模型在复杂机器人任务中存在准确性不足的问题，如模拟与现实的差距和认知不确定性，尤其是在数据有限的情况下。

Method: 通过将模型不确定性估计融入MCTS算法，优先选择预测不确定性较低的动作，从而优化决策。

Result: 在液体倾倒任务中，该方法显著提高了成功率，尤其在数据有限的情况下优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了在机器人任务中处理不确定性的潜力，为鲁棒决策提供了新思路。

Abstract: Physics-based simulations and learning-based models are vital for complex
robotics tasks like deformable object manipulation and liquid handling.
However, these models often struggle with accuracy due to epistemic uncertainty
or the sim-to-real gap. For instance, accurately pouring liquid from one
container to another poses challenges, particularly when models are trained on
limited demonstrations and may perform poorly in novel situations. This paper
proposes an uncertainty-aware Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm designed
to mitigate these inaccuracies. By incorporating estimates of model
uncertainty, the proposed MCTS strategy biases the search towards actions with
lower predicted uncertainty. This approach enhances the reliability of planning
under uncertain conditions. Applied to a liquid pouring task, our method
demonstrates improved success rates even with models trained on minimal data,
outperforming traditional methods and showcasing its potential for robust
decision-making in robotics.

Abstract: To facilitate the wider adoption of robotics, accessible programming tools
are required for non-experts. Observational learning enables intuitive human
skills transfer through hands-on demonstrations, but relying solely on visual
input can be inefficient in terms of scalability and failure mitigation,
especially when based on a single demonstration. This paper presents a
human-in-the-loop method for enhancing the robot execution plan, automatically
generated based on a single RGB video, with natural language input to a Large
Language Model (LLM). By including user-specified goals or critical task
aspects and exploiting the LLM common-sense reasoning, the system adjusts the
vision-based plan to prevent potential failures and adapts it based on the
received instructions. Experiments demonstrated the framework intuitiveness and
effectiveness in correcting vision-derived errors and adapting plans without
requiring additional demonstrations. Moreover, interactive plan refinement and
hallucination corrections promoted system robustness.

Abstract: This work proposes a novel hybrid approach for vision-only navigation of
mobile robots, which combines advances of both deep learning approaches and
classical model-based planning algorithms. Today, purely data-driven end-to-end
models are dominant solutions to this problem. Despite advantages such as
flexibility and adaptability, the requirement of a large amount of training

estimation, visual place recognition, and pose estimation, employing
topological graphs as a representation of the target environment. Using such a
combination, we provide a scalable system with a higher level of

Conclusion: SonicGauss展示了3DGS在声音合成中的潜力，为视觉与听觉交互提供了新方向。

Abstract: While 3D Gaussian representations (3DGS) have proven effective for modeling
the geometry and appearance of objects, their potential for capturing other
physical attributes-such as sound-remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we
present a novel framework dubbed SonicGauss for synthesizing impact sounds from
3DGS representations by leveraging their inherent geometric and material
properties. Specifically, we integrate a diffusion-based sound synthesis model
with a PointTransformer-based feature extractor to infer material
characteristics and spatial-acoustic correlations directly from Gaussian
ellipsoids. Our approach supports spatially varying sound responses conditioned
on impact locations and generalizes across a wide range of object categories.
Experiments on the ObjectFolder dataset and real-world recordings demonstrate
that our method produces realistic, position-aware auditory feedback. The
results highlight the framework's robustness and generalization ability,
offering a promising step toward bridging 3D visual representations and

Motivation: 零样本音频分类中，文本描述嵌入的噪声问题影响了分类准确性，尤其是对多样化的音频类别。

Method: 通过将音频嵌入按类别分组并处理，替代噪声文本嵌入，提出少样本方法。

Result: 实验结果表明，少样本分类通常优于零样本基线。

Conclusion: 少样本方法能有效提升音频分类性能，尤其在多样化音频类别中表现更优。

Abstract: State-of-the-art audio classification often employs a zero-shot approach,
which involves comparing audio embeddings with embeddings from text describing
the respective audio class. These embeddings are usually generated by neural
networks trained through contrastive learning to align audio and text
representations. Identifying the optimal text description for an audio class is
challenging, particularly when the class comprises a wide variety of sounds.
This paper examines few-shot methods designed to improve classification
accuracy beyond the zero-shot approach. Specifically, audio embeddings are
grouped by class and processed to replace the inherently noisy text embeddings.
Our results demonstrate that few-shot classification typically outperforms the
zero-shot baseline.

Result: 在SPRSound和ICBHI数据集上达到新基准，计算量减少50%，FBS模块提升现有Transformer模型性能。

Conclusion: CNN-TSA框架在资源受限环境下实现高效、实时的呼吸音分析，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Accurate classification of respiratory sounds requires deep learning models
that effectively capture fine-grained acoustic features and long-range temporal
dependencies. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are well-suited for
extracting local time-frequency patterns but are limited in modeling global
context. In contrast, transformer-based models can capture long-range
dependencies, albeit with higher computational demands. To address these
limitations, we propose a compact CNN-Temporal Self-Attention (CNN-TSA) network
that integrates lightweight self-attention into an efficient CNN backbone.
Central to our approach is a Frequency Band Selection (FBS) module that
suppresses noisy and non-informative frequency regions, substantially improving
accuracy and reducing FLOPs by up to 50%. We also introduce age-specific models
to enhance robustness across diverse patient groups. Evaluated on the
SPRSound-2022/2023 and ICBHI-2017 lung sound datasets, CNN-TSA with FBS sets
new benchmarks on SPRSound and achieves state-of-the-art performance on ICBHI,
all with a significantly smaller computational footprint. Furthermore,
integrating FBS into an existing transformer baseline yields a new record on
ICBHI, confirming FBS as an effective drop-in enhancement. These results
demonstrate that our framework enables reliable, real-time respiratory sound
analysis suitable for deployment in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have significantly improved symbolic
music generation. However, most approaches rely on transformer-based
architectures with self-attention mechanisms, which are constrained by
quadratic computational complexity, limiting scalability for long sequences. To
address this, we propose Symbolic Music Diffusion with Mamba (SMDIM), a novel
diffusion-based architecture integrating Structured State Space Models (SSMs)
for efficient global context modeling and the Mamba-FeedForward-Attention Block
(MFA) for precise local detail preservation. The MFA Block combines the linear
complexity of Mamba layers, the non-linear refinement of FeedForward layers,
and the fine-grained precision of self-attention mechanisms, achieving a
balance between scalability and musical expressiveness. SMDIM achieves
near-linear complexity, making it highly efficient for long-sequence tasks.
Evaluated on diverse datasets, including FolkDB, a collection of traditional
Chinese folk music that represents an underexplored domain in symbolic music
generation, SMDIM outperforms state-of-the-art models in both generation
quality and computational efficiency. Beyond symbolic music, SMDIM's

Conclusion: 本文为解决ZS-TTS系统中的说话人隐私问题提供了新方法，并提出了评估指标spk-ZRF。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Zero-Shot Text-to-Speech (ZS-TTS) technology has
enabled high-fidelity voice synthesis from minimal audio cues, raising
significant privacy and ethical concerns. Despite the threats to voice privacy,
research to selectively remove the knowledge to replicate unwanted individual
voices from pre-trained model parameters has not been explored. In this paper,
we address the new challenge of speaker identity unlearning for ZS-TTS systems.
To meet this goal, we propose the first machine unlearning frameworks for
ZS-TTS, especially Teacher-Guided Unlearning (TGU), designed to ensure the
model forgets designated speaker identities while retaining its ability to
generate accurate speech for other speakers. Our proposed methods incorporate
randomness to prevent consistent replication of forget speakers' voices,
assuring unlearned identities remain untraceable. Additionally, we propose a
new evaluation metric, speaker-Zero Retrain Forgetting (spk-ZRF). This assesses
the model's ability to disregard prompts associated with forgotten speakers,
effectively neutralizing its knowledge of these voices. The experiments
conducted on the state-of-the-art model demonstrate that TGU prevents the model
from replicating forget speakers' voices while maintaining high quality for
other speakers. The demo is available at https://speechunlearn.github.io/

Abstract: Recent audio LLMs have emerged rapidly, demonstrating strong generalization
across various speech tasks. However, given the inherent complexity of speech
signals, these models inevitably suffer from performance degradation in

target domains without any labeled data. We propose a self-improvement method
called SI-SDA, leveraging the information embedded in large-model decoding to
evaluate the quality of generated pseudo labels and then perform domain
adaptation based on reinforcement learning optimization. Experimental results
show that our method consistently and significantly improves audio LLM
performance, outperforming existing baselines in WER and BLEU across multiple

Conclusion: 联合建模波形和频谱视图可生成鲁棒的音频伪造检测表示。

Abstract: Recent advances in synthetic speech have made audio deepfakes increasingly
realistic, posing significant security risks. Existing detection methods that
rely on a single modality, either raw waveform embeddings or spectral based
features, are vulnerable to non spoof disturbances and often overfit to known
forgery algorithms, resulting in poor generalization to unseen attacks. To
address these shortcomings, we investigate hybrid fusion frameworks that
integrate self supervised learning (SSL) based representations with handcrafted
spectral descriptors (MFCC , LFCC, CQCC). By aligning and combining
complementary information across modalities, these fusion approaches capture
subtle artifacts that single feature approaches typically overlook. We explore
several fusion strategies, including simple concatenation, cross attention,
mutual cross attention, and a learnable gating mechanism, to optimally blend
SSL features with fine grained spectral cues. We evaluate our approach on four
challenging public benchmarks and report generalization performance. All fusion
variants consistently outperform an SSL only baseline, with the cross attention
strategy achieving the best generalization with a 38% relative reduction in
equal error rate (EER). These results confirm that joint modeling of waveform
and spectral views produces robust, domain agnostic representations for audio
deepfake detection.

Conclusion: 双曲空间建模能更好地处理音频效果链的非交换性和指数增长特性，为效果链识别提供了新思路。

Abstract: Audio effects (AFXs) are essential tools in music production, frequently
applied in chains to shape timbre and dynamics. The order of AFXs in a chain
plays a crucial role in determining the final sound, particularly when
non-linear (e.g., distortion) or time-variant (e.g., chorus) processors are
involved. Despite its importance, most AFX-related studies have primarily
focused on estimating effect types and their parameters from a wet signal. To
address this gap, we formulate AFX chain recognition as the task of jointly
estimating AFX types and their order from a wet signal. We propose a
neural-network-based method that embeds wet signals into a hyperbolic space and
classifies their AFX chains. Hyperbolic space can represent tree-structured
data more efficiently than Euclidean space due to its exponential expansion
property. Since AFX chains can be represented as trees, with AFXs as nodes and
edges encoding effect order, hyperbolic space is well-suited for modeling the
exponentially growing and non-commutative nature of ordered AFX combinations,
where changes in effect order can result in different final sounds. Experiments
using guitar sounds demonstrate that, with an appropriate curvature, the
proposed method outperforms its Euclidean counterpart. Further analysis based
on AFX type and chain length highlights the effectiveness of the proposed
method in capturing AFX order.

Abstract: Despite the rapid development of neural vocoders in recent years, they
usually suffer from some intrinsic challenges like opaque modeling, and
parameter-performance trade-off. In this study, we propose an innovative
time-frequency (T-F) domain-based neural vocoder to resolve the above-mentioned
challenges. To be specific, we bridge the connection between the classical
signal range-null decomposition (RND) theory and vocoder task, and the
reconstruction of target spectrogram can be decomposed into the superimposition
between the range-space and null-space, where the former is enabled by a linear
domain shift from the original mel-scale domain to the target linear-scale
domain, and the latter is instantiated via a learnable network for further
spectral detail generation. Accordingly, we propose a novel dual-path
framework, where the spectrum is hierarchically encoded/decoded, and the cross-
and narrow-band modules are elaborately devised for efficient sub-band and
sequential modeling. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on the LJSpeech
and LibriTTS benchmarks. Quantitative and qualitative results show that while

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于流匹配的JAM模型，首次实现了歌词到歌曲生成中的细粒度词级控制和美学对齐，并通过公开数据集JAME标准化评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前歌词到歌曲生成模型缺乏细粒度词级控制，无法满足音乐工作者的需求，且生成质量有待提升。

Method: 采用流匹配技术实现词级时间和持续控制，并通过直接偏好优化（DPO）进行美学对齐，无需人工标注数据。

Result: JAM模型在音乐特定属性上优于现有模型。

Conclusion: JAM为歌词到歌曲生成提供了更精细的控制和更高的质量，同时通过JAME数据集推动了标准化评估。

Abstract: Diffusion and flow-matching models have revolutionized automatic
text-to-audio generation in recent times. These models are increasingly capable
of generating high quality and faithful audio outputs capturing to speech and
acoustic events. However, there is still much room for improvement in creative
audio generation that primarily involves music and songs. Recent open
lyrics-to-song models, such as, DiffRhythm, ACE-Step, and LeVo, have set an
acceptable standard in automatic song generation for recreational use. However,
these models lack fine-grained word-level controllability often desired by
musicians in their workflows. To the best of our knowledge, our
flow-matching-based JAM is the first effort toward endowing word-level timing
and duration control in song generation, allowing fine-grained vocal control.
To enhance the quality of generated songs to better align with human
preferences, we implement aesthetic alignment through Direct Preference
Optimization, which iteratively refines the model using a synthetic dataset,
eliminating the need or manual data annotations. Furthermore, we aim to
standardize the evaluation of such lyrics-to-song models through our public
evaluation dataset JAME. We show that JAM outperforms the existing models in
terms of the music-specific attributes.

TL;DR: Music Arena是一个开放平台，用于通过人类偏好评估文本到音乐（TTM）模型，提供标准化、透明的评估协议和音乐特定功能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决TTM模型中人类偏好评估的高成本和难以比较的问题，同时为研究人员提供开放的偏好数据来源。

Method: 通过实时用户输入文本提示并比较两个TTM系统的输出，收集偏好数据，使用LLM路由系统和详细偏好收集功能。

Result: 建立了标准化评估协议和透明数据访问政策，为TTM生态系统提供可持续的偏好数据来源。

Conclusion: Music Arena通过其独特设计和实时评估，解决了TTM领域的关键挑战，并为其他AI领域的评估提供了参考。

Abstract: We present Music Arena, an open platform for scalable human preference
evaluation of text-to-music (TTM) models. Soliciting human preferences via
listening studies is the gold standard for evaluation in TTM, but these studies
are expensive to conduct and difficult to compare, as study protocols may
differ across systems. Moreover, human preferences might help researchers align
their TTM systems or improve automatic evaluation metrics, but an open and
renewable source of preferences does not currently exist. We aim to fill these
gaps by offering *live* evaluation for TTM. In Music Arena, real-world users
input text prompts of their choosing and compare outputs from two TTM systems,
and their preferences are used to compile a leaderboard. While Music Arena
follows recent evaluation trends in other AI domains, we also design it with
key features tailored to music: an LLM-based routing system to navigate the
heterogeneous type signatures of TTM systems, and the collection of *detailed*
preferences including listening data and natural language feedback. We also
propose a rolling data release policy with user privacy guarantees, providing a
renewable source of preference data and increasing platform transparency.
Through its standardized evaluation protocol, transparent data access policies,
and music-specific features, Music Arena not only addresses key challenges in
the TTM ecosystem but also demonstrates how live evaluation can be thoughtfully
adapted to unique characteristics of specific AI domains.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLM）作为游戏辅助工具对玩家表现和体验的影响，发现LLM辅助界面显著提升了玩家表现和游戏体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型的兴起，游戏交互从固定命令转向自然对话，但其对玩家表现和体验的影响尚未充分研究。

Method: 在Minecraft中设计LLM辅助界面，通过自然语言交互简化复杂命令，并对30名参与者进行混合方法研究，比较LLM辅助与传统命令界面的效果。

Result: LLM辅助界面显著提升了玩家表现、参与度和整体游戏体验，且任务复杂度对不同界面效果有显著影响。

Conclusion: LLM辅助界面有潜力革新虚拟体验，但需在直观性、可预测性、透明度和用户控制之间取得平衡。

Abstract: With large language models (LLMs) on the rise, in-game interactions are
shifting from rigid commands to natural conversations. However, the impacts of
LLMs on player performance and game experience remain underexplored. This work
explores LLM's role as a co-builder during gameplay, examining its impact on
task performance, usability, and player experience. Using Minecraft as a
sandbox, we present an LLM-assisted interface that engages players through
natural language, aiming to facilitate creativity and simplify complex gaming
commands. We conducted a mixed-methods study with 30 participants, comparing
LLM-assisted and command-based interfaces across simple and complex game tasks.
Quantitative and qualitative analyses reveal that the LLM-assisted interface
significantly improves player performance, engagement, and overall game
experience. Additionally, task complexity has a notable effect on player
performance and experience across both interfaces. Our findings highlight the
potential of LLM-assisted interfaces to revolutionize virtual experiences,
emphasizing the importance of balancing intuitiveness with predictability,
transparency, and user agency in AI-driven, multimodal gaming environments.

*Giuseppe Riva*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“增强认知支架”的框架，旨在解决AI作为认知协作工具时可能引发的“舒适-成长悖论”，即AI的便利性可能导致用户认知停滞。该框架通过渐进式自主性、适应性个性化和认知负荷优化三个维度，将AI从助手转变为导师，以促进用户认知发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI系统作为认知协作工具可能因过度便利导致用户认知停滞，即“舒适-成长悖论”。为了解决这一问题，论文提出重新定义AI的角色，使其从助手转变为动态导师。

Method: 基于维果茨基理论、教育支架原则和AI伦理，提出了“增强认知支架”框架，包含三个维度：渐进式自主性、适应性个性化和认知负荷优化。

Result: 研究表明，该框架在教育、职场、创意和医疗领域能加速技能获取、提升自我调节能力和高阶思维能力，同时避免了依赖性、技能退化和偏见放大等风险。

Conclusion: “增强认知支架”通过优先考虑认知发展而非便利性，为人类与AI协作提供了一条既能放大认知能力又能保障自主思考和持续学习的路径。

Abstract: AI systems now function as cognitive extensions, evolving from tools to
active cognitive collaborators within human-AI integrated systems. While these
systems can amplify cognition - enhancing problem-solving, learning, and
creativity - they present a fundamental "comfort-growth paradox": AI's
user-friendly nature may foster intellectual stagnation by minimizing cognitive
friction necessary for development. As AI aligns with user preferences and
provides frictionless assistance, it risks inducing cognitive complacency
rather than promoting growth. We introduce Enhanced Cognitive Scaffolding to
resolve this paradox - reconceptualizing AI from convenient assistant to
dynamic mentor. Drawing from Vygotskian theories, educational scaffolding
principles, and AI ethics, our framework integrates three dimensions: (1)
Progressive Autonomy, where AI support gradually fades as user competence
increases; (2) Adaptive Personalization, tailoring assistance to individual
needs and learning trajectories; and (3) Cognitive Load Optimization, balancing
mental effort to maximize learning while minimizing unnecessary complexity.
Research across educational, workplace, creative, and healthcare domains
supports this approach, demonstrating accelerated skill acquisition, improved
self-regulation, and enhanced higher-order thinking. The framework includes
safeguards against risks like dependency, skill atrophy, and bias
amplification. By prioritizing cognitive development over convenience in
human-AI interaction, Enhanced Cognitive Scaffolding offers a pathway toward
genuinely amplified cognition while safeguarding autonomous thought and
continuous learning.

TL;DR: 研究发现，简单的监督协议在提升评估者准确性方面无明显优势，但某些情况下展示正反论证可提高准确性。评估者易受偏见影响，且随着模型能力提升，监督协议的适用性可能降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨监督协议是否能帮助评估者准确验证能力更强的AI模型，并分析评估者偏见对监督效果的影响。

Method: 通过两项研究测试简单监督协议的效果，包括展示正反论证和在线研究对评估者信心的影响。

Result: 研究未发现监督协议整体优势，但某些情况下展示正反论证可提高准确性；评估者易因在线研究增加对错误答案的信心。

Conclusion: 监督协议需进一步测试其对评估者偏见的鲁棒性、是否优于简单依赖模型，以及是否随问题难度和模型能力提升而保持有效性。

Abstract: Scalable oversight protocols aim to empower evaluators to accurately verify
AI models more capable than themselves. However, human evaluators are subject
to biases that can lead to systematic errors. We conduct two studies examining
the performance of simple oversight protocols where evaluators know that the
model is "correct most of the time, but not all of the time". We find no
overall advantage for the tested protocols, although in Study 1, showing
arguments in favor of both answers improves accuracy in cases where the model
is incorrect. In Study 2, participants in both groups become more confident in
the system's answers after conducting online research, even when those answers
are incorrect. We also reanalyze data from prior work that was more optimistic
about simple protocols, finding that human evaluators possessing knowledge
absent from models likely contributed to their positive results--an advantage
that diminishes as models continue to scale in capability. These findings
underscore the importance of testing the degree to which oversight protocols
are robust to evaluator biases, whether they outperform simple deference to the
model under evaluation, and whether their performance scales with increasing
problem difficulty and model capability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注图表问答或摘要，缺乏对图表代码重建任务的研究，因此需要一种方法生成高质量的图表-代码对以支持模型能力评估。

Method: ChartGen通过视觉语言模型（VLM）和代码导向的大语言模型（LLM）迭代重建和增强图表代码，生成合成数据集。

Result: 创建了包含27种图表类型、11种绘图库的22.5万图表-代码对数据集，并评估了6种VLMs，显示仍有改进空间。

Conclusion: ChartGen为图表理解和视觉条件代码生成提供了新资源，推动了相关研究的发展。

Abstract: Chart-to-code reconstruction -- the task of recovering executable plotting
scripts from chart images -- provides important insights into a model's ability
to ground data visualizations in precise, machine-readable form. Yet many
existing multimodal benchmarks largely focus primarily on answering questions
about charts or summarizing them. To bridge this gap, we present ChartGen, a
fully-automated pipeline for code-guided synthetic chart generation. Starting
from seed chart images, ChartGen (i) prompts a vision-language model (VLM) to
reconstruct each image into a python script, and (ii) iteratively augments that
script with a code-oriented large language model (LLM). Using ChartGen, we
create 222.5K unique chart-image code pairs from 13K seed chart images, and
present an open-source synthetic chart dataset covering 27 chart types, 11
plotting libraries, and multiple data modalities (image, code, text, CSV,
DocTags). From this corpus, we curate a held-out chart-to-code evaluation
subset of 4.3K chart image-code pairs, and evaluate six open-weight VLMs (3B -
26B parameters), highlighting substantial room for progress. We release the
pipeline, prompts, and the dataset to help accelerate efforts towards robust
chart understanding and vision-conditioned code generation:

TL;DR: PSYA框架基于认知三角（情感-思维-行动），通过三个核心模块更准确地模拟人类行为，实验证明其生成的行为更自然、可信。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成代理框架在情感建模上过于简化，限制了模拟的真实性。

Method: PSYA框架包含情感模块（分层情感模型）、思维模块（三重网络模型）和行动模块（整合情感、需求和计划）。

Result: 实验结果表明PSYA生成的行为更自然、一致、多样且可信，成功复现了人类实验结果。

Conclusion: PSYA为生成代理提供了更丰富准确的情感与认知建模方法，可作为心理学实验的替代方案。

Abstract: Generative agents have made significant progress in simulating human
behavior, but existing frameworks often simplify emotional modeling and focus
primarily on specific tasks, limiting the authenticity of the simulation. Our
work proposes the Psychological-mechanism Agent (PSYA) framework, based on the
Cognitive Triangle (Feeling-Thought-Action), designed to more accurately
simulate human behavior. The PSYA consists of three core modules: the Feeling
module (using a layer model of affect to simulate changes in short-term,
medium-term, and long-term emotions), the Thought module (based on the Triple
Network Model to support goal-directed and spontaneous thinking), and the
Action module (optimizing agent behavior through the integration of emotions,
needs and plans). To evaluate the framework's effectiveness, we conducted daily
life simulations and extended the evaluation metrics to self-influence,
one-influence, and group-influence, selection five classic psychological
experiments for simulation. The results show that the PSYA framework generates
more natural, consistent, diverse, and credible behaviors, successfully
replicating human experimental outcomes. Our work provides a richer and more
accurate emotional and cognitive modeling approach for generative agents and
offers an alternative to human participants in psychological experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前HCI研究过于关注AI艺术的检测与自动化，忽视了艺术价值源于人类创作中的创造性挣扎。

Method: 通过历史案例研究，分析艺术风格的形成过程及其与AI生成的区别。

Result: 指出AI系统将人类创作选择简化为可复制的模式，缺乏对创作过程的记录。

Conclusion: 建议HCI研究应转向自动记录艺术风格的演变和创作选择，而非仅追求美学效果。

Abstract: As AI art generation becomes increasingly sophisticated, HCI research has
focused primarily on questions of detection, authenticity, and automation. This
paper argues that such approaches fundamentally misunderstand how artistic
value emerges from the concerns that drive human image production. Through
examination of historical precedents, we demonstrate that artistic style is not
only visual appearance but the resolution of creative struggle, as artists
wrestle with influence and technical constraints to develop unique ways of
seeing. Current AI systems flatten these human choices into reproducible
patterns without preserving their provenance. We propose that HCI's role lies
not only in perfecting visual output, but in developing means to document the
origins and evolution of artistic style as it appears within generated visual
traces. This reframing suggests new technical directions for HCI research in
generative AI, focused on automatic documentation of stylistic lineage and
creative choice rather than simple reproduction of aesthetic effects.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for tailored healthcare
communication but face challenges in interpretability and multi-task
integration particularly for domain-specific needs like myopia, and their
real-world effectiveness as patient education tools has yet to be demonstrated.
Here, we introduce ChatMyopia, an LLM-based AI agent designed to address text
and image-based inquiries related to myopia. To achieve this, ChatMyopia
integrates an image classification tool and a retrieval-augmented knowledge
base built from literature, expert consensus, and clinical guidelines. Myopic
maculopathy grading task, single question examination and human evaluations
validated its ability to deliver personalized, accurate, and safe responses to
myopia-related inquiries with high scalability and interpretability. In a
randomized controlled trial (n=70, NCT06607822), ChatMyopia significantly
improved patient satisfaction compared to traditional leaflets, enhancing
patient education in accuracy, empathy, disease awareness, and patient-eyecare
practitioner communication. These findings highlight ChatMyopia's potential as
a valuable supplement to enhance patient education and improve satisfaction

Conclusion: 论文通过量化凝视压力，为人工智能设计提供了包容性框架，有助于促进社会心理空间的扩展。

Abstract: The proliferation of artificial intelligence provides an opportunity to
create psychological spaciousness in society. Spaciousness is defined as the
ability to hold diverse interpersonal interactions and forms the basis for
vulnerability that leads to authenticity that leads to prosocial behaviors and
thus to societal harmony. This paper demonstrates an attempt to quantify, the
human conditioning to subconsciously modify authentic self-expression to fit
the norms of the dominant culture. Gaze is explored across various marginalized
and intersectional groups, using concepts from postmodern philosophy and
psychology. The effects of gaze are studied through analyzing a few redacted
Reddit posts, only to be discussed in discourse and not endorsement. A
mathematical formulation for the Gaze Pressure Index (GPI)-Diff Composite
Metric is presented to model the analysis of two sets of conversational spaces
in relation to one another. The outcome includes an equation to train Large
Language Models (LLMs) - the working mechanism of AI products such as Chat-GPT;
and an argument for affirming and inclusive HCI, based on the equation, is
presented. The argument is supported by a few principles of Neuro-plasticity,

Abstract: In the research and development (R&D) and verification and validation (V&V)
phases of autonomous driving decision-making and planning systems, it is
necessary to integrate human factors to achieve decision-making and evaluation
that align with human cognition. However, most existing datasets primarily
focus on vehicle motion states and trajectories, neglecting human-related
information. In addition, current naturalistic driving datasets lack sufficient
safety-critical scenarios while simulated datasets suffer from low
authenticity. To address these issues, this paper constructs the Risk-Informed
Subjective Evaluation and Eye-tracking (RISEE) dataset which specifically
contains human subjective evaluations and eye-tracking data apart from regular
naturalistic driving trajectories. By leveraging the complementary advantages
of drone-based (high realism and extensive scenario coverage) and
simulation-based (high safety and reproducibility) data collection methods, we
first conduct drone-based traffic video recording at a highway ramp merging
area. After that, the manually selected highly interactive scenarios are
reconstructed in simulation software, and drivers' first-person view (FPV)
videos are generated, which are then viewed and evaluated by recruited
participants. During the video viewing process, participants' eye-tracking data
is collected. After data processing and filtering, 3567 valid subjective risk
ratings from 101 participants across 179 scenarios are retained, along with
2045 qualified eye-tracking data segments. The collected data and examples of
the generated FPV videos are available in our website.

Conclusion: TULCA为张量比较分析提供了有效工具，结合可视化界面提升了分析效率。

Abstract: Comparing tensors and identifying their (dis)similar structures is
fundamental in understanding the underlying phenomena for complex data. Tensor
decomposition methods help analysts extract tensors' essential characteristics
and aid in visual analytics for tensors. In contrast to dimensionality
reduction (DR) methods designed only for analyzing a matrix (i.e., second-order
tensor), existing tensor decomposition methods do not support flexible
comparative analysis. To address this analysis limitation, we introduce a new
tensor decomposition method, named tensor unified linear comparative analysis
(TULCA), by extending its DR counterpart, ULCA, for tensor analysis. TULCA
integrates discriminant analysis and contrastive learning schemes for tensor
decomposition, enabling flexible comparison of tensors. We also introduce an
effective method to visualize a core tensor extracted from TULCA into a set of
2D visualizations. We integrate TULCA's functionalities into a visual analytics
interface to support analysts in interpreting and refining the TULCA results.
We demonstrate the efficacy of TULCA and the visual analytics interface with
computational evaluations and two case studies, including an analysis of log
data collected from a supercomputer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究实践中降维技术选择偏倚视觉吸引力而非结构忠实性的现象。

Method: 通过用户研究验证偏倚存在并分析其原因。

Result: 视觉吸引力偏倚影响投影选择，尤其在颜色编码标签和短时间曝光下更明显。

Conclusion: 提出缓解偏倚的策略，以改进降维投影的感知和解释。

Abstract: Selecting the dimensionality reduction technique that faithfully represents
the structure is essential for reliable visual communication and analytics. In
reality, however, practitioners favor projections for other attractions, such
as aesthetics and visual saliency, over the projection's structural
faithfulness, a bias we define as visual interestingness. In this research, we
conduct a user study that (1) verifies the existence of such bias and (2)
explains why the bias exists. Our study suggests that visual interestingness
biases practitioners' preferences when selecting projections for analysis, and
this bias intensifies with color-encoded labels and shorter exposure time.
Based on our findings, we discuss strategies to mitigate bias in perceiving and
interpreting DR projections.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文揭示了MCP协议的安全漏洞，展示了低技术门槛的攻击方式，并提出了改进建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究MCP协议在AI工具集成中的安全漏洞，特别是低技术门槛的攻击可能性。

Method: 通过概念验证攻击，利用恶意天气MCP服务器窃取银行数据，展示攻击链的简易性。

Result: 发现MCP生态系统中存在跨服务器攻击面，攻击门槛极低。

Conclusion: 当前MCP实现存在安全隐患，需立即缓解措施和协议改进。

Abstract: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) represents a significant advancement in
AI-tool integration, enabling seamless communication between AI agents and
external services. However, this connectivity introduces novel attack vectors
that remain largely unexplored. This paper demonstrates how unsophisticated
threat actors, requiring only basic programming skills and free web tools, can
exploit MCP's trust model to exfiltrate sensitive financial data. We present a
proof-of-concept attack where a malicious weather MCP server, disguised as
benign functionality, discovers and exploits legitimate banking tools to steal
user account balances. The attack chain requires no advanced technical
knowledge, server infrastructure, or monetary investment. The findings reveal a
critical security gap in the emerging MCP ecosystem: while individual servers
may appear trustworthy, their combination creates unexpected cross-server
attack surfaces. Unlike traditional cybersecurity threats that assume
sophisticated adversaries, our research shows that the barrier to entry for
MCP-based attacks is alarmingly low. A threat actor with undergraduate-level
Python knowledge can craft convincing social engineering attacks that exploit
the implicit trust relationships MCP establishes between AI agents and tool
providers. This work contributes to the nascent field of MCP security by
demonstrating that current MCP implementations allow trivial cross-server
attacks and proposing both immediate mitigations and protocol improvements to
secure this emerging ecosystem.

Abstract: As AI-driven dataspaces become integral to data sharing and collaborative
analytics, ensuring privacy, performance, and policy compliance presents
significant challenges. This paper provides a comprehensive review of
privacy-preserving and policy-aware AI techniques, including Federated
Learning, Differential Privacy, Trusted Execution Environments, Homomorphic
Encryption, and Secure Multi-Party Computation, alongside strategies for
aligning AI with regulatory frameworks such as GDPR and the EU AI Act. We
propose a novel taxonomy to classify these techniques based on privacy levels,
performance impacts, and compliance complexity, offering a clear framework for
practitioners and researchers to navigate trade-offs. Key performance metrics
-- latency, throughput, cost overhead, model utility, fairness, and
explainability -- are analyzed to highlight the multi-dimensional optimization
required in dataspaces. The paper identifies critical research gaps, including
the lack of standardized privacy-performance KPIs, challenges in explainable AI
for federated ecosystems, and semantic policy enforcement amidst regulatory
fragmentation. Future directions are outlined, proposing a conceptual framework
for policy-driven alignment, automated compliance validation, standardized
benchmarking, and integration with European initiatives like GAIA-X, IDS, and
Eclipse EDC. By synthesizing technical, ethical, and regulatory perspectives,
this work lays the groundwork for developing trustworthy, efficient, and
compliant AI systems in dataspaces, fostering innovation in secure and
responsible data-driven ecosystems.

Result: 实验显示ConSeg的攻击成功率比现有方法提高了15.55%，且能抵抗先进的后门防御。

Conclusion: ConSeg是一种高效的后门攻击方法，利用上下文信息显著提升了攻击效果。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in computer vision, semantic segmentation
models may be susceptible to backdoor attacks. These attacks, involving hidden
triggers, aim to cause the models to misclassify instances of the victim class
as the target class when triggers are present, posing serious threats to the
reliability of these models. To further explore the field of backdoor attacks
against semantic segmentation, in this paper, we propose a simple yet effective
backdoor attack called Contextual Segmentation Backdoor Attack (ConSeg). ConSeg
leverages the contextual information inherent in semantic segmentation models
to enhance backdoor performance. Our method is motivated by an intriguing
observation, i.e., when the target class is set as the `co-occurring' class of
the victim class, the victim class can be more easily `mis-segmented'. Building
upon this insight, ConSeg mimics the contextual information of the target class
and rebuilds it in the victim region to establish the contextual relationship
between the target class and the victim class, making the attack easier. Our
experiments reveal that ConSeg achieves improvements in Attack Success Rate
(ASR) with increases of 15.55\%, compared to existing methods, while exhibiting
resilience against state-of-the-art backdoor defenses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度学习模型部署在终端设备上，知识产权风险增加，现有水印方法不适用于大规模分发场景。

Method: 通过在多分支低秩适应（LoRA）模块中嵌入多个水印，实现高效定制化水印，结合参数混淆机制防止水印移除。

Conclusion: Hot-Swap MarkBoard是一种高效、灵活的水印方法，适用于多种模型架构和任务，有效保护模型知识产权。

Abstract: Recently, Deep Learning (DL) models have been increasingly deployed on
end-user devices as On-Device AI, offering improved efficiency and privacy.
However, this deployment trend poses more serious Intellectual Property (IP)
risks, as models are distributed on numerous local devices, making them
vulnerable to theft and redistribution. Most existing ownership protection
solutions (e.g., backdoor-based watermarking) are designed for cloud-based
AI-as-a-Service (AIaaS) and are not directly applicable to large-scale
distribution scenarios, where each user-specific model instance must carry a
unique watermark. These methods typically embed a fixed watermark, and
modifying the embedded watermark requires retraining the model. To address
these challenges, we propose Hot-Swap MarkBoard, an efficient watermarking
method. It encodes user-specific $n$-bit binary signatures by independently
embedding multiple watermarks into a multi-branch Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
module, enabling efficient watermark customization without retraining through
branch swapping. A parameter obfuscation mechanism further entangles the
watermark weights with those of the base model, preventing removal without
degrading model performance. The method supports black-box verification and is
compatible with various model architectures and DL tasks, including
classification, image generation, and text generation. Extensive experiments
across three types of tasks and six backbone models demonstrate our method's
superior efficiency and adaptability compared to existing approaches, achieving
100\% verification accuracy.

Result: 实验证明该框架在Uniswap v3数据上有效支持用户细分和协议对齐的声誉系统。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了上下文感知且可扩展的DeFi用户评分，有助于改进风险评估和激励设计。

Abstract: As decentralized finance (DeFi) evolves, distinguishing between user
behaviors - liquidity provision versus active trading - has become vital for
risk modeling and on-chain reputation. We propose a behavioral scoring
framework for Uniswap that assigns two complementary scores: a Liquidity
Provision Score that assesses strategic liquidity contributions, and a Swap
Behavior Score that reflects trading intent, volatility exposure, and
discipline. The scores are constructed using rule-based blueprints that
decompose behavior into volume, frequency, holding time, and withdrawal
patterns. To handle edge cases and learn feature interactions, we introduce a
deep residual neural network with densely connected skip blocks inspired by the
U-Net architecture. We also incorporate pool-level context such as total value
locked (TVL), fee tiers, and pool size, allowing the system to differentiate
similar user behaviors across pools with varying characteristics. Our framework
enables context-aware and scalable DeFi user scoring, supporting improved risk
assessment and incentive design. Experiments on Uniswap v3 data show its
usefulness for user segmentation and protocol-aligned reputation systems.
Although we refer to our metric as zScore, it is independently developed and
methodologically different from the cross-protocol system proposed by Udupi et
al. Our focus is on role-specific behavioral modeling within Uniswap using
blueprint logic and supervised learning.

Result: CGG-ARO提升任务完成率和效益约7.1%和7.7%，MA-DDQN进一步提升至11.0%和12.5%。

Conclusion: Oranits在动态ITS环境中实现了更快、更自适应且高效的任务处理。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore mission assignment and task offloading in an Open
Radio Access Network (Open RAN)-based intelligent transportation system (ITS),
where autonomous vehicles leverage mobile edge computing for efficient
processing. Existing studies often overlook the intricate interdependencies
between missions and the costs associated with offloading tasks to edge
servers, leading to suboptimal decision-making. To bridge this gap, we
introduce Oranits, a novel system model that explicitly accounts for mission
dependencies and offloading costs while optimizing performance through vehicle
cooperation. To achieve this, we propose a twofold optimization approach.
First, we develop a metaheuristic-based evolutionary computing algorithm,
namely the Chaotic Gaussian-based Global ARO (CGG-ARO), serving as a baseline
for one-slot optimization. Second, we design an enhanced reward-based deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, referred to as the Multi-agent Double
Deep Q-Network (MA-DDQN), that integrates both multi-agent coordination and
multi-action selection mechanisms, significantly reducing mission assignment
time and improving adaptability over baseline methods. Extensive simulations
reveal that CGG-ARO improves the number of completed missions and overall
benefit by approximately 7.1% and 7.7%, respectively. Meanwhile, MA-DDQN
achieves even greater improvements of 11.0% in terms of mission completions and
12.5% in terms of the overall benefit. These results highlight the
effectiveness of Oranits in enabling faster, more adaptive, and more efficient
task processing in dynamic ITS environments.

Abstract: This paper presents an in-depth investigation into the high-performance
parallel optimization of the Fish School Behaviour (FSB) algorithm on the
Setonix supercomputing platform using the OpenMP framework. Given the
increasing demand for enhanced computational capabilities for complex,
large-scale calculations across diverse domains, there's an imperative need for
optimized parallel algorithms and computing structures. The FSB algorithm,
inspired by nature's social behavior patterns, provides an ideal platform for
parallelization due to its iterative and computationally intensive nature. This
study leverages the capabilities of the Setonix platform and the OpenMP
framework to analyze various aspects of multi-threading, such as thread counts,
scheduling strategies, and OpenMP constructs, aiming to discern patterns and
strategies that can elevate program performance. Experiments were designed to
rigorously test different configurations, and our results not only offer
insights for parallel optimization of FSB on Setonix but also provide valuable
references for other parallel computational research using OpenMP. Looking
forward, other factors, such as cache behavior and thread scheduling strategies
at micro and macro levels, hold potential for further exploration and
optimization.

Result: 强化学习方法能学习高性能调度决策，但需要大量探索；专家方法依赖先验知识，适应性较差。结合两者可提升性能。

Conclusion: 动态选择调度算法在OpenMP中是可行且有益的，并可扩展到MPI程序。

Abstract: Scientific and data science applications are becoming increasingly complex,
with growing computational and memory demands. Modern high performance
computing (HPC) systems provide high parallelism and heterogeneity across
nodes, devices, and cores. To achieve good performance, effective scheduling
and load balancing techniques are essential. Parallel programming frameworks
such as OpenMP now offer a variety of advanced scheduling algorithms to support
diverse applications and platforms. This creates an instance of the scheduling
algorithm selection problem, which involves identifying the most suitable
algorithm for a given combination of workload and system characteristics.
  In this work, we explore learning-based approaches for selecting scheduling
algorithms in OpenMP. We propose and evaluate expert-based and reinforcement
learning (RL)-based methods, and conduct a detailed performance analysis across
six applications and three systems. Our results show that RL methods are
capable of learning high-performing scheduling decisions, although they require
significant exploration, with the choice of reward function playing a key role.
Expert-based methods, in contrast, rely on prior knowledge and involve less
exploration, though they may not always identify the optimal algorithm for a
specific application-system pair. By combining expert knowledge with RL-based
learning, we achieve improved performance and greater adaptability.
  Overall, this work demonstrates that dynamic selection of scheduling
algorithms during execution is both viable and beneficial for OpenMP
applications. The approach can also be extended to MPI-based programs, enabling
optimization of scheduling decisions across multiple levels of parallelism.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新颖的中值滤波算法，通过分层分块减少冗余计算，实现了更高的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统中值滤波算法在高计算成本下表现不佳，尤其是随着核尺寸的增加，排序方法的扩展性较差。

Method: 利用排序问题的可分性，通过分层分块设计两种变体：一种基于寄存器操作的数据无关选择网络，另一种基于随机存取内存的数据感知方法。

Result: 算法在CUDA实现中比现有技术快5倍，是8、16和32位数据类型及3×3至75×75核的最快中值滤波器。

Conclusion: 新算法显著提升了中值滤波的效率，适用于多种数据类型和核尺寸。

Abstract: Median filtering is a non-linear smoothing technique widely used in digital
image processing to remove noise while retaining sharp edges. It is
particularly well suited to removing outliers (impulse noise) or granular
artifacts (speckle noise). However, the high computational cost of median
filtering can be prohibitive. Sorting-based algorithms excel with small kernels
but scale poorly with increasing kernel diameter, in contrast to constant-time
methods characterized by higher constant factors but better scalability, such
as histogram-based approaches or the 2D wavelet matrix.
  This paper introduces a novel algorithm, leveraging the separability of the
sorting problem through hierarchical tiling to minimize redundant computations.
We propose two variants: a data-oblivious selection network that can operate
entirely within registers, and a data-aware version utilizing random-access
memory. These achieve per-pixel complexities of $O(k \log(k))$ and $O(k)$,
respectively, for a $k \times k$ kernel - unprecedented for sorting-based
methods. Our CUDA implementation is up to 5 times faster than the current state
of the art on a modern GPU and is the fastest median filter in most cases for
8-, 16-, and 32-bit data types and kernels from $3 \times 3$ to $75 \times 75$.

Motivation: 现有方法难以生成与音乐节奏和用户定义风格协调的高质量舞蹈视频，限制了实际应用。

Method: 使用SMPL参数作为中介，结合MotionTune音乐编码器捕捉音频运动线索，支持风格可控的高保真视频生成。

Result: ChoreoMuse在视频质量、节奏对齐、舞蹈多样性和风格一致性上表现优异。

Conclusion: ChoreoMuse为广泛创意应用提供了强大解决方案。

Abstract: Modern artistic productions increasingly demand automated choreography
generation that adapts to diverse musical styles and individual dancer
characteristics. Existing approaches often fail to produce high-quality dance
videos that harmonize with both musical rhythm and user-defined choreography
styles, limiting their applicability in real-world creative contexts. To
address this gap, we introduce ChoreoMuse, a diffusion-based framework that
uses SMPL format parameters and their variation version as intermediaries
between music and video generation, thereby overcoming the usual constraints
imposed by video resolution. Critically, ChoreoMuse supports
style-controllable, high-fidelity dance video generation across diverse musical
genres and individual dancer characteristics, including the flexibility to
handle any reference individual at any resolution. Our method employs a novel
music encoder MotionTune to capture motion cues from audio, ensuring that the
generated choreography closely follows the beat and expressive qualities of the
input music. To quantitatively evaluate how well the generated dances match
both musical and choreographic styles, we introduce two new metrics that
measure alignment with the intended stylistic cues. Extensive experiments
confirm that ChoreoMuse achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple
dimensions, including video quality, beat alignment, dance diversity, and style
adherence, demonstrating its potential as a robust solution for a wide range of
creative applications. Video results can be found on our project page:

Abstract: Real-time path tracing is rapidly becoming the standard for rendering in
entertainment and professional applications. In scientific visualization,
volume rendering plays a crucial role in helping researchers analyze and
interpret complex 3D data. Recently, photorealistic rendering techniques have
gained popularity in scientific visualization, yet they face significant
challenges. One of the most prominent issues is slow rendering performance and
high pixel variance caused by Monte Carlo integration. In this work, we
introduce a novel radiance caching approach for path-traced volume rendering.
Our method leverages advances in volumetric scene representation and adapts 3D
Gaussian splatting to function as a multi-level, path-space radiance cache.
This cache is designed to be trainable on the fly, dynamically adapting to
changes in scene parameters such as lighting configurations and transfer
functions. By incorporating our cache, we achieve less noisy, higher-quality
images without increasing rendering costs. To evaluate our approach, we compare
it against a baseline path tracer that supports uniform sampling and next-event
estimation and the state-of-the-art for neural radiance caching. Through both
quantitative and qualitative analyses, we demonstrate that our path-space
radiance cache is a robust solution that is easy to integrate and significantly
enhances the rendering quality of volumetric visualization applications while
maintaining comparable computational efficiency.

Abstract: Recent advances in leveraging large-scale Internet photo collections for 3D
reconstruction have enabled immersive virtual exploration of landmarks and
historic sites worldwide. However, little attention has been given to the
immersive understanding of architectural styles and structural knowledge, which
remains largely confined to browsing static text-image pairs. Therefore, can we
draw inspiration from 3D in-the-wild reconstruction techniques and use
unconstrained photo collections to create an immersive approach for
understanding the 3D structure of architectural components? To this end, we
extend language embedded 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) and propose a novel
framework for open-vocabulary scene understanding from unconstrained photo
collections. Specifically, we first render multiple appearance images from the
same viewpoint as the unconstrained image with the reconstructed radiance
field, then extract multi-appearance CLIP features and two types of language
feature uncertainty maps-transient and appearance uncertainty-derived from the
multi-appearance features to guide the subsequent optimization process. Next,
we propose a transient uncertainty-aware autoencoder, a multi-appearance
language field 3DGS representation, and a post-ensemble strategy to effectively
compress, learn, and fuse language features from multiple appearances. Finally,
to quantitatively evaluate our method, we introduce PT-OVS, a new benchmark
dataset for assessing open-vocabulary segmentation performance on unconstrained
photo collections. Experimental results show that our method outperforms
existing methods, delivering accurate open-vocabulary segmentation and enabling
applications such as interactive roaming with open-vocabulary queries,
architectural style pattern recognition, and 3D scene editing.

Conclusion: 解耦几何与外观可实现高效参数和高质量重建，同时简化纹理网格提取。

Abstract: Gaussian splatting techniques have shown promising results in novel view
synthesis, achieving high fidelity and efficiency. However, their high
reconstruction quality comes at the cost of requiring a large number of
primitives. We identify this issue as stemming from the entanglement of
geometry and appearance in Gaussian Splatting. To address this, we introduce a
neural shell texture, a global representation that encodes texture information
around the surface. We use Gaussian primitives as both a geometric
representation and texture field samplers, efficiently splatting texture
features into image space. Our evaluation demonstrates that this
disentanglement enables high parameter efficiency, fine texture detail
reconstruction, and easy textured mesh extraction, all while using
significantly fewer primitives.

TL;DR: MCP4EDA是首个通过自然语言交互控制开源RTL-to-GDSII设计流程的模型上下文协议服务器，利用LLM优化设计流程，实现闭环优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统EDA流程依赖线负载模型，无法准确反映物理实现效果，MCP4EDA旨在通过LLM利用实际后端数据优化设计。

Method: 集成Yosys、Icarus Verilog等工具，通过LLM分析OpenLane的后端数据，迭代优化TCL脚本，实现闭环优化。

Result: 实验显示时序收敛提升15-30%，面积减少10-20%，优于默认流程。

Conclusion: MCP4EDA是首个实用的LLM控制端到端开源EDA自动化系统。

Abstract: This paper presents MCP4EDA, the first Model Context Protocol server that
enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to control and optimize the complete
open-source RTL-to-GDSII design flow through natural language interaction. The
system integrates Yosys synthesis, Icarus Verilog simulation, OpenLane
place-and-route, GTKWave analysis, and KLayout visualization into a unified
LLM-accessible interface, enabling designers to execute complex multi-tool EDA
workflows conversationally via AI assistants such as Claude Desktop and Cursor
IDE. The principal contribution is a backend-aware synthesis optimization
methodology wherein LLMs analyze actual post-layout timing, power, and area
metrics from OpenLane results to iteratively refine synthesis TCL scripts,
establishing a closed-loop optimization system that bridges the traditional gap
between synthesis estimates and physical implementation reality. In contrast to
conventional flows that rely on wire-load models, this methodology leverages
real backend performance data to guide synthesis parameter tuning, optimization
sequence selection, and constraint refinement, with the LLM functioning as an
intelligent design space exploration agent. Experimental evaluation on
representative digital designs demonstrates 15-30% improvements in timing
closure and 10-20% area reduction compared to default synthesis flows,
establishing MCP4EDA as the first practical LLM-controlled end-to-end
open-source EDA automation system. The code and demo are avaiable at:

*Dongfang Zhao*

Main category: math.AG

TL;DR: 论文挑战了LLM词嵌入空间的基础流形假设，提出通过方案理论的“爆破”方法解决几何奇点问题，实现表示的去奇点化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法假设数据流形平滑，无法处理多义词导致的几何奇点问题，需提出新方法解决表示不稳定性。

Method: 采用方案理论的爆破技术，将奇异点替换为异常除子（投影空间），构建新的几何嵌入空间。

Result: 证明了新空间的几何正则化定理，解决了原始病理问题。

Conclusion: 提出从静态查找转向动态几何计算的新范式，为LLM架构设计提供新思路。

Abstract: Recent work has provided compelling evidence challenging the foundational
manifold hypothesis for the token embedding spaces of Large Language Models
(LLMs). These findings reveal the presence of geometric singularities around
polysemous tokens, which can lead to representational instability. Existing
methodologies, which presuppose a smooth data manifold, are ill-equipped to
address such intrinsic structural flaws. In this paper, we formalize this
problem in the language of scheme theory and propose a rigorous resolution by
applying the scheme-theoretic blow-up at each singular point. This procedure
replaces a singular point in the ambient affine scheme with its exceptional
divisor, which we identify as a canonical geometric space -- a projective space
of directions -- that houses the disambiguated semantic meanings of the token.
This process of ``representational desingularization'' constructs a new
geometric landscape for embeddings. We prove a formal theorem guaranteeing the
geometric regularization of this new space, showing that the original
pathologies are resolved. Finally, we outline the architectural implications of
our framework, arguing for a paradigm shift from static look-ups to dynamic,
geometrically-grounded computation.

TL;DR: IPIP框架通过迭代预训练和遗忘机制提升MLIP模型的性能，减少预测误差并加速模拟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有预训练策略在目标匹配和泛化能力上存在不足，IPIP旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 提出IPIP框架，结合迭代预训练和遗忘机制，避免局部最优。

Result: 在Mo-S-O系统中，预测误差减少80%，速度提升4倍。

Conclusion: IPIP在轻量架构下实现高效准确模拟，优于通用力场和基础模型。

Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) enable efficient molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations with ab initio accuracy and have been applied across
various domains in physical science. However, their performance often relies on
large-scale labeled training data. While existing pretraining strategies can
improve model performance, they often suffer from a mismatch between the
objectives of pretraining and downstream tasks or rely on extensive labeled
datasets and increasingly complex architectures to achieve broad
generalization. To address these challenges, we propose Iterative Pretraining
for Interatomic Potentials (IPIP), a framework designed to iteratively improve
the predictive performance of MLIP models. IPIP incorporates a forgetting
mechanism to prevent iterative training from converging to suboptimal local
minima. Unlike general-purpose foundation models, which frequently underperform
on specialized tasks due to a trade-off between generality and system-specific
accuracy, IPIP achieves higher accuracy and efficiency using lightweight
architectures. Compared to general-purpose force fields, this approach achieves
over 80% reduction in prediction error and up to 4x speedup in the challenging
Mo-S-O system, enabling fast and accurate simulations.

TL;DR: 比较了从静息态功能MRI中提取的九种特征子类型在行为预测中的表现，发现功能连接（FC）在预测认知、年龄和性别方面表现最佳，而图信号处理（GSP）和变异性特征也显示出潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发神经影像生物标志物以预测精神和神经疾病的行为变量，需要提取合适的特征。

Method: 比较了九种特征子类型（包括功能活动和功能连接等）在预测行为变量中的表现，研究了样本量和扫描时间对预测性能的影响。

Result: FC在预测认知、年龄和性别方面表现最佳；GSP和变异性特征在某些情况下也有潜力。样本量和扫描时间的平衡对预测性能至关重要。

Conclusion: FC是行为预测的稳健特征，但GSP和变异性特征也值得关注。未来的研究应考虑数据采集和样本组成的策略。

Abstract: Predicting behavioral variables from neuroimaging modalities such as magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) has the potential to allow the development of
neuroimaging biomarkers of mental and neurological disorders. A crucial
processing step to this aim is the extraction of suitable features. These can
differ in how well they predict the target of interest, and how this prediction
scales with sample size and scan time. Here, we compare nine feature subtypes
extracted from resting-state functional MRI recordings for behavior prediction,
ranging from regional measures of functional activity to functional
connectivity (FC) and metrics derived with graph signal processing (GSP), a
principled approach for the extraction of structure-informed functional
features. We study 979 subjects from the Human Connectome Project Young Adult
dataset, predicting summary scores for mental health, cognition, processing
speed, and substance use, as well as age and sex. The scaling properties of the
features are investigated for different combinations of sample size and scan
time. FC comes out as the best feature for predicting cognition, age, and sex.
Graph power spectral density is the second best for predicting cognition and
age, while for sex, variability-based features show potential as well. When
predicting sex, the low-pass graph filtered coupled FC slightly outperforms the
simple FC variant. None of the other targets were predicted significantly. The
scaling results point to higher performance reserves for the better-performing
features. They also indicate that it is important to balance sample size and
scan time when acquiring data for prediction studies. The results confirm FC as
a robust feature for behavior prediction, but also show the potential of GSP
and variability-based measures. We discuss the implications for future
prediction studies in terms of strategies for acquisition and sample
composition.

Motivation: 解决CT图像中肺结节良恶性分类的挑战，提高分类准确性和泛化能力。

Method: 使用三种预训练网络（EfficientNet V2 S、MobileViT XXS、DenseNet201）并定制分类头，结合两阶段注意力机制和元学习器，采用动态焦点损失和MixUp增强。

Result: 在LIDC-IDRI数据集上达到98.09%准确率和0.9961 AUC，错误率降低35%，敏感性和特异性均超过98%。

Conclusion: 该方法可作为肺癌筛查的自动化辅助工具，显著提升分类性能。

Abstract: In this work, we address the challenge of binary lung nodule classification
(benign vs malignant) using CT images by proposing a multi-level attention
stacked ensemble of deep neural networks. Three pretrained backbones --
EfficientNet V2 S, MobileViT XXS, and DenseNet201 -- are each adapted with a
custom classification head tailored to 96 x 96 pixel inputs. A two-stage
attention mechanism learns both model-wise and class-wise importance scores
from concatenated logits, and a lightweight meta-learner refines the final
prediction. To mitigate class imbalance and improve generalization, we employ
dynamic focal loss with empirically calculated class weights, MixUp
augmentation during training, and test-time augmentation at inference.
Experiments on the LIDC-IDRI dataset demonstrate exceptional performance,
achieving 98.09 accuracy and 0.9961 AUC, representing a 35 percent reduction in
error rate compared to state-of-the-art methods. The model exhibits balanced
performance across sensitivity (98.73) and specificity (98.96), with
particularly strong results on challenging cases where radiologist disagreement
was high. Statistical significance testing confirms the robustness of these
improvements across multiple experimental runs. Our approach can serve as a
robust, automated aid for radiologists in lung cancer screening.

Motivation: 传统临床模型在预测结直肠肝转移患者预后时准确性不足，因此需要更可靠的预测工具。

Method: 研究使用术前基线临床参数和CT影像的放射组学特征，开发并验证了机器学习模型，重点关注术后3、6、12个月的复发预测。

Conclusion: 该研究成功开发了早期复发预测模型，并强调了数据泄漏风险，提出了增强模型可靠性的框架。

Abstract: Prognostic evaluation in patients with colorectal liver metastases (CRLM)
remains challenging due to suboptimal accuracy of conventional clinical models.
This study developed and validated a robust machine learning model for
predicting postoperative recurrence risk. Preliminary ensemble models achieved
exceptionally high performance (AUC $>$ 0.98) but incorporated postoperative
features, introducing data leakage risks. To enhance clinical applicability, we
restricted input variables to preoperative baseline clinical parameters and
radiomic features from contrast-enhanced CT imaging, specifically targeting
recurrence prediction at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. The 3-month
recurrence prediction model demonstrated optimal performance with an AUC of
0.723 in cross-validation. Decision curve analysis revealed that across
threshold probabilities of 0.55-0.95, the model consistently provided greater
net benefit than "treat-all" or "treat-none" strategies, supporting its utility
in postoperative surveillance and therapeutic decision-making. This study
successfully developed a robust predictive model for early CRLM recurrence with
confirmed clinical utility. Importantly, it highlights the critical risk of
data leakage in clinical prognostic modeling and proposes a rigorous framework
to mitigate this issue, enhancing model reliability and translational value in
real-world settings.

Motivation: 高光谱图像（HSI）的光谱带顺序结构为自监督学习提供了独特机会，但目前尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出SpecBPP框架，通过恢复打乱的光谱段顺序来学习全局光谱理解，并采用基于课程的学习策略逐步增加排列难度。

Result: 在EnMAP卫星数据的土壤有机碳估计任务中，SpecBPP优于其他基线方法，R²为0.9456，RMSE为1.1053%，RPD为4.19。

Conclusion: 光谱顺序预测是高光谱理解的有效前置任务，为遥感及其他领域的科学表示学习开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning has revolutionized representation learning in vision
and language, but remains underexplored for hyperspectral imagery (HSI), where
the sequential structure of spectral bands offers unique opportunities. In this
work, we propose Spectral Band Permutation Prediction (SpecBPP), a novel
self-supervised learning framework that leverages the inherent spectral
continuity in HSI. Instead of reconstructing masked bands, SpecBPP challenges a
model to recover the correct order of shuffled spectral segments, encouraging
global spectral understanding. We implement a curriculum-based training
strategy that progressively increases permutation difficulty to manage the
factorial complexity of the permutation space. Applied to Soil Organic Carbon
(SOC) estimation using EnMAP satellite data, our method achieves
state-of-the-art results, outperforming both masked autoencoder (MAE) and
joint-embedding predictive (JEPA) baselines. Fine-tuned on limited labeled
samples, our model yields an $R^2$ of 0.9456, RMSE of 1.1053%, and RPD of 4.19,
significantly surpassing traditional and self-supervised benchmarks. Our
results demonstrate that spectral order prediction is a powerful pretext task
for hyperspectral understanding, opening new avenues for scientific
representation learning in remote sensing and beyond.

Abstract: Automated breast cancer classification from mammography remains a significant
challenge due to subtle distinctions between benign and malignant tissue. In
this work, we present a hybrid framework combining deep convolutional features
from a ResNet-50 backbone with handcrafted descriptors and transformer-based
embeddings. Using the CBIS-DDSM dataset, we benchmark our ResNet-50 baseline
(AUC: 78.1%) and demonstrate that fusing handcrafted features with deep
ResNet-50 and DINOv2 features improves AUC to 79.6% (setup d1), with a peak
recall of 80.5% (setup d1) and highest F1 score of 67.4% (setup d1). Our
experiments show that handcrafted features not only complement deep
representations but also enhance performance beyond transformer-based
embeddings. This hybrid fusion approach achieves results comparable to
state-of-the-art methods while maintaining architectural simplicity and
computational efficiency, making it a practical and effective solution for
clinical decision support.

Result: 实验验证表明该方法显著提升性能，并在竞赛中获得第一名。

Conclusion: 输入空间标准化是解决多机构医学影像域偏移的稳健实用方案。

Abstract: Multi-source CT-scan classification suffers from domain shifts that impair
cross-source generalization. While preprocessing pipelines combining
Spatial-Slice Feature Learning (SSFL++) and Kernel-Density-based Slice Sampling
(KDS) have shown empirical success, the mechanisms underlying their domain
robustness remain underexplored. This study analyzes how this input-space
standardization manages the trade-off between local discriminability and
cross-source generalization. The SSFL++ and KDS pipeline performs spatial and
temporal standardization to reduce inter-source variance, effectively mapping
disparate inputs into a consistent target space. This preemptive alignment
mitigates domain shift and simplifies the learning task for network
optimization. Experimental validation demonstrates consistent improvements
across architectures, proving the benefits stem from the preprocessing itself.
The approach's effectiveness was validated by securing first place in a
competitive challenge, supporting input-space standardization as a robust and
practical solution for multi-institutional medical imaging.

Abstract: Medical image analysis plays a pivotal role in the early diagnosis of
diseases such as skin lesions. However, the scarcity of data and the class
imbalance significantly hinder the performance of deep learning models. We
propose a novel method that leverages the pretrained Stable Diffusion-2.0 model
to generate high-quality synthetic skin lesion images and corresponding
segmentation masks. This approach augments training datasets for classification
and segmentation tasks. We adapt Stable Diffusion-2.0 through domain-specific
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning and joint optimization of
multi-objective loss functions, enabling the model to simultaneously generate
clinically relevant images and segmentation masks conditioned on textual
descriptions in a single step. Experimental results show that the generated
images, validated by FID scores, closely resemble real images in quality. A
hybrid dataset combining real and synthetic data markedly enhances the
performance of classification and segmentation models, achieving substantial
improvements in accuracy and F1-score of 8% to 15%, with additional positive
gains in other key metrics such as the Dice coefficient and IoU. Our approach
offers a scalable solution to address the challenges of medical imaging data,
contributing to improved accuracy and reliability in diagnosing rare diseases.

<details>

Motivation: 3D-PAT在稀疏和带宽受限的传感器条件下图像质量下降，需要一种方法恢复宽带信号以提高成像质量。

Method: 引入正弦激活的深度学习模型，通过模拟随机球形吸收体进行简化训练，强调带宽学习而非数据记忆。

Result: 模型在叶骨架、螺旋体模和人体手掌血管实验中表现良好，显著提升了高频内容和图像质量。

Conclusion: 正弦激活模型有效恢复带宽，提高了3D-PAT的成像速度和实用性。

Abstract: 3D photoacoustic tomography (3D-PAT) using high-frequency hemispherical
transducers offers near-omnidirectional reception and enhanced sensitivity to
the finer structural details encoded in the high-frequency components of the
broadband photoacoustic (PA) signal. However, practical constraints such as
limited number of channels with bandlimited sampling rate often result in
sparse and bandlimited sensors that degrade image quality. To address this, we
revisit the 2D deep learning (DL) approach applied directly to sensor-wise PA
radio-frequency (PARF) data. Specifically, we introduce sine activation into
the DL model to restore the broadband nature of PARF signals given the observed
band-limited and high-frequency PARF data. Given the scarcity of 3D training
data, we employ simplified training strategies by simulating random spherical
absorbers. This combination of sine-activated model and randomized training is
designed to emphasize bandwidth learning over dataset memorization. Our model
was evaluated on a leaf skeleton phantom, a micro-CT-verified 3D spiral phantom
and in-vivo human palm vasculature. The results showed that the proposed
training mechanism on sine-activated model was well-generalized across the
different tests by effectively increasing the sensor density and recovering the
spatiotemporal bandwidth. Qualitatively, the sine-activated model uniquely
enhanced high-frequency content that produces clearer vascular structure with
fewer artefacts. Quantitatively, the sine-activated model exhibits full
bandwidth at -12 dB spectrum and significantly higher contrast-to-noise ratio
with minimal loss of structural similarity index. Lastly, we optimized our
approach to enable fast enhanced 3D-PAT at 2 volumes-per-second for better
practical imaging of a free-moving targets.

Result: 实验表明，DPSR在低功耗硬件上实现实时超分辨率，性能优于或媲美更复杂的现有方法。

Conclusion: DPSR是一种高效、轻量级的超分辨率方法，适用于卫星上的实时处理需求。

Abstract: Hyperspectral imagers on satellites obtain the fine spectral signatures
essential for distinguishing one material from another at the expense of
limited spatial resolution. Enhancing the latter is thus a desirable
preprocessing step in order to further improve the detection capabilities
offered by hyperspectral images on downstream tasks. At the same time, there is
a growing interest towards deploying inference methods directly onboard of
satellites, which calls for lightweight image super-resolution methods that can
be run on the payload in real time. In this paper, we present a novel neural
network design, called Deep Pushbroom Super-Resolution (DPSR) that matches the
pushbroom acquisition of hyperspectral sensors by processing an image line by
line in the along-track direction with a causal memory mechanism to exploit
previously acquired lines. This design greatly limits memory requirements and
computational complexity, achieving onboard real-time performance, i.e., the
ability to super-resolve a line in the time it takes to acquire the next one,
on low-power hardware. Experiments show that the quality of the super-resolved
images is competitive or even outperforms state-of-the-art methods that are
significantly more complex.

Abstract: Diffusion-based deep generative models have emerged as powerful tools for
inverse materials design. Yet, many existing approaches overlook essential
chemical constraints such as oxidation state balance, which can lead to
chemically invalid structures. Here we introduce CrysVCD (Crystal generator
with Valence-Constrained Design), a modular framework that integrates chemical
rules directly into the generative process. CrysVCD first employs a
transformer-based elemental language model to generate valence-balanced
compositions, followed by a diffusion model to generate crystal structures. The
valence constraint enables orders-of-magnitude more efficient chemical valence
checking, compared to pure data-driven approaches with post-screening. When
fine-tuned on stability metrics, CrysVCD achieves 85% thermodynamic stability
and 68% phonon stability. Moreover, CrysVCD supports conditional generation of
functional materials, enabling discovery of candidates such as high thermal
conductivity semiconductors and high-$\kappa$ dielectric compounds. Designed as
a general-purpose plugin, CrysVCD can be integrated into diverse generative
pipeline to promote chemical validity, offering a reliable, scientifically
grounded path for materials discovery.

Abstract: Ensuring the trustworthiness and robustness of deep learning models remains a
fundamental challenge, particularly in high-stakes scientific applications. In
this study, we present a framework called attention-guided training that
combines explainable artificial intelligence techniques with quantitative
evaluation and domain-specific priors to guide model attention. We demonstrate
that domain specific feedback on model explanations during training can enhance
the model's generalization capabilities. We validate our approach on the task
of semantic crack tip segmentation in digital image correlation data which is a
key application in the fracture mechanical characterization of materials. By
aligning model attention with physically meaningful stress fields, such as
those described by Williams' analytical solution, attention-guided training
ensures that the model focuses on physically relevant regions. This finally
leads to improved generalization and more faithful explanations.

driver is determined by a pointwise maximization over a primitive, possibly
non-convex, uncertainty set. The system's tractability is predicated not on
convexity, but on a global analytic hypothesis: the existence of a unique and
globally Lipschitz maximizer map for the driver function. Under this
hypothesis, which carves out a tractable class of models, we establish
well-posedness via a fixed-point argument. For a distinct, geometrically
regular class of models, we prove a result of independent interest: under
non-degeneracy conditions from Malliavin calculus, the maximizer is unique
along any solution path, ensuring the model's internal consistency. We clarify
the fundamental logical gap between this pathwise property and the global
regularity required by our existence proof. The resulting valuation operator
defines a dynamically consistent expectation, and we establish its connection
to fully nonlinear PDEs via a Feynman-Kac formula.

### [546] [Optimizing Spreading Factor Selection for Mobile LoRa Gateways Using Single-Channel Hardware](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19938)
*W. A. Sasindu Wijesuriya*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种静态选择最优扩频因子（SF）的两阶段算法，以解决低成本单通道LoRa网关在移动部署中缺乏动态配置支持的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LoRaWAN网络中的动态数据速率（ADR）机制需要昂贵的多通道网关支持，而低成本单通道网关无法实现实时优化。

Method: 采用两阶段算法：首先基于规则排除不满足距离、数据速率、链路裕度和法规限制的SF；然后通过加权评分模型评估剩余候选SF。

Result: 在672个模拟场景中，92%的情况下所选SF与最优SF匹配，验证了算法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该算法为成本敏感环境（如农业和农村传感应用）提供了一种可扩展的替代方案，实现了可靠的移动LoRa部署。

Abstract: The deployment of mobile LoRa gateways using low-cost single-channel hardware
presents a significant challenge in maintaining reliable communication due to
the lack of dynamic configuration support. In traditional LoRaWAN networks,
Adaptive Data Rate (ADR) mechanisms optimize communication parameters in real
time. However, such features are typically supported only by expensive
multi-channel gateways. This study proposes a cost-effective and
energy-efficient solution by statically selecting the optimal Spreading Factor
(SF) using a two-phase algorithm. The method first applies rule-based exclusion
to eliminate SFs that violate constraints related to distance, data rate, link
margin, and regulatory limits. Remaining candidates are then evaluated using a
weighted scoring model incorporating Time-on-Air, energy consumption, data
rate, and link robustness. The proposed algorithm was validated through
extensive field tests and NS-3 simulations under line-of-sight conditions.
Results demonstrate that the selected SF matched the optimal SF in over 92% of
cases across 672 simulated scenarios, confirming the algorithm's effectiveness.
This approach offers a scalable alternative to dynamic protocols, enabling
reliable mobile LoRa deployments in cost-sensitive environments such as
agriculture and rural sensing applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证Sionna v1.0.2射线追踪在复杂城市环境中的模拟真实性，以提升室外射频模拟的可靠性。

Method: 使用1,664个用户设备和6个基站站点的实测数据，系统调整模拟参数（如路径深度、天线属性等），并通过Spearman相关性和kNN定位算法评估模拟效果。

Result: 天线位置和方向对模拟效果影响显著，优化后Spearman相关性提升5%至130%，kNN定位误差减少三分之一。

Conclusion: 精确的几何和可信的天线模型是必要的，但捕捉城市噪声仍是实现高保真室外射频模拟的挑战。

Abstract: We study the realism of Sionna v1.0.2 ray-tracing for outdoor cellular links
in central Rome. We use a real measurement set of 1,664 user-equipments (UEs)
and six nominal base-station (BS) sites. Using these fixed positions we
systematically vary the main simulation parameters, including path depth,
diffuse/specular/refraction flags, carrier frequency, as well as antenna's
properties like its altitude, radiation pattern, and orientation. Simulator
fidelity is scored for each base station via Spearman correlation between
measured and simulated powers, and by a fingerprint-based k-nearest-neighbor
localization algorithm using RSSI-based fingerprints. Across all experiments,
solver hyper-parameters are having immaterial effect on the chosen metrics. On
the contrary, antenna locations and orientations prove decisive. By simple
greedy optimization we improve the Spearman correlation by 5% to 130% for
various base stations, while kNN-based localization error using only simulated
data as reference points is decreased by one-third on real-world samples, while
staying twice higher than the error with purely real data. Precise geometry and
credible antenna models are therefore necessary but not sufficient; faithfully
capturing the residual urban noise remains an open challenge for transferable,
high-fidelity outdoor RF simulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统网络指标（如延迟和数据包丢失）已无法满足现代智能应用对信息质量的多维需求，需要新的度量方法。

Method: 引入了一个系统化的四维分类框架（时间、质量/效用、可靠性/鲁棒性、网络/通信），并结合人工智能技术进行优化。

Result: 揭示了信息质量各维度之间的相互依赖性，并通过六个关键应用领域展示了多维信息指标的潜力。

Conclusion: 多维信息指标对满足多样化操作需求具有革命性意义，但仍面临实施挑战。

Abstract: The development of next-generation networking systems has inherently shifted
from throughput-based paradigms towards intelligent, information-aware designs
that emphasize the quality, relevance, and utility of transmitted information,
rather than sheer data volume. While classical network metrics, such as latency
and packet loss, remain significant, they are insufficient to quantify the
nuanced information quality requirements of modern intelligent applications,
including autonomous vehicles, digital twins, and metaverse environments. In
this survey, we present the first comprehensive study of the ``X of
Information'' continuum by introducing a systematic four-dimensional taxonomic
framework that structures information metrics along temporal, quality/utility,
reliability/robustness, and network/communication dimensions. We uncover the
increasing interdependencies among these dimensions, whereby temporal freshness
triggers quality evaluation, which in turn helps with reliability appraisal,
ultimately enabling effective network delivery. Our analysis reveals that
artificial intelligence technologies, such as deep reinforcement learning,
multi-agent systems, and neural optimization models, enable adaptive,
context-aware optimization of competing information quality objectives. In our
extensive study of six critical application domains, covering autonomous
transportation, industrial IoT, healthcare digital twins, UAV communications,
LLM ecosystems, and metaverse settings, we illustrate the revolutionary promise
of multi-dimensional information metrics for meeting diverse operational needs.
Our survey identifies prominent implementation challenges, including ...

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩散模型的双流时空生成模型（DSTF-Diffusion），用于生成高质量的网络流量数据以提升DDoS攻击检测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有合成数据方法难以捕捉复杂时空模式，导致生成数据与真实数据相似度不足，影响机器学习检测效果。

Method: 采用双流结构：场流通过空间映射将网络数据特征与预训练扩散模型结合，时空流动态建模网络流量的时间模式。

Result: 生成数据在统计相似性和下游任务性能上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DSTF-Diffusion能有效生成高质量网络流量数据，提升DDoS攻击检测的准确性。

Abstract: In response to Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, recent research
efforts increasingly rely on Machine Learning (ML)-based solutions, whose
effectiveness largely depends on the quality of labeled training datasets. To
address the scarcity of such datasets, data augmentation with synthetic traces
is often employed. However, current synthetic trace generation methods struggle
to capture the complex temporal patterns and spatial distributions exhibited in
emerging DDoS attacks. This results in insufficient resemblance to real traces
and unsatisfied detection accuracy when applied to ML tasks. In this paper, we
propose Dual-Stream Temporal-Field Diffusion (DSTF-Diffusion), a multi-view,
multi-stream network traffic generative model based on diffusion models,
featuring two main streams: The field stream utilizes spatial mapping to bridge
network data characteristics with pre-trained realms of stable diffusion
models, effectively translating complex network interactions into formats that
stable diffusion can process, while the spatial stream adopts a dynamic
temporal modeling approach, meticulously capturing the intrinsic temporal
patterns of network traffic. Extensive experiments demonstrate that data
generated by our model exhibits higher statistical similarity to originals
compared to current state-of-the-art solutions, and enhance performances on a
wide range of downstream tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为FedABC的客户端选择算法，旨在解决联邦学习中的数据异质性和客户端参与效率问题，显著提升了模型精度和参与效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G网络中支持原生AI的需求推动了联邦学习的发展，但数据异质性和频繁客户端参与带来的通信与计算负担成为挑战。

Method: FedABC通过注意力机制评估客户端模型相似性和独特贡献，动态调整选择阈值，优化客户端参与。

Result: 在CIFAR-10上的实验表明，FedABC比FedAvg少用32%的客户端，比现有最优方法精度高3.5%，且客户端参与减少2%。

Conclusion: FedABC为异构资源受限环境中的联邦学习部署提供了有效解决方案，支持6G网络的原生AI能力。

Abstract: Native AI support is a key objective in the evolution of 6G networks, with
Federated Learning (FL) emerging as a promising paradigm. FL allows
decentralized clients to collaboratively train an AI model without directly
sharing their data, preserving privacy. Clients train local models on private
data and share model updates, which a central server aggregates to refine the
global model and redistribute it for the next iteration. However, client data
heterogeneity slows convergence and reduces model accuracy, and frequent client
participation imposes communication and computational burdens. To address these
challenges, we propose \textit{FedABC}, an innovative client selection
algorithm designed to take a long-term view in managing data heterogeneity and
optimizing client participation. Inspired by attention mechanisms,
\textit{FedABC} prioritizes informative clients by evaluating both model
similarity and each model's unique contributions to the global model. Moreover,
considering the evolving demands of the global model, we formulate an
optimization problem to guide \textit{FedABC} throughout the training process.
Following the ``later-is-better" principle, \textit{FedABC} adaptively adjusts
the client selection threshold, encouraging greater participation in later
training stages. Extensive simulations on CIFAR-10 demonstrate that
\textit{FedABC} significantly outperforms existing approaches in model accuracy
and client participation efficiency, achieving comparable performance with 32\%
fewer clients than the classical FL algorithm \textit{FedAvg}, and 3.5\% higher
accuracy with 2\% fewer clients than the state-of-the-art. This work marks a
step toward deploying FL in heterogeneous, resource-constrained environments,
thereby supporting native AI capabilities in 6G networks.

Abstract: Brownian motion have long been studied on a diversity of fields, not only in
physics of statistical mechanics, but also in biological models, finance and
economic process, and social systems. In the past twenty years, there has been
a growing interest in studying the model in self-propelled feature and
interaction force such that the model also fits into study of social phenomenon
of many individuals. This article will continue with this research trend and
especially investigate the model in paradigms for a quantitative description of
social and economic process. We mainly discuss a class of collective decision
process of Brownian agent/particles, where the stochastic process does not
exist in the fluctuation in the traditional Brownian motion, but in selection
among several discrete choices. Their decisions interacts with each other in a
given social topology. To simplify our discussion the binary choice problem is
particularly discussed where each agent only takes an alternative of two
choices. Mathematically, we introduce a set of arrays to describe social
relationship of agents in a quantitative manner, and the arrays deduce the
group social force and opinion dynamics, which are useful to study complex
social movement and self-organization phenomena including discrete-choice
activities, social groups and de-individualization effect. Such agent-based
simulation symbolizes a variety of collective activities in human society,
especially in the field of economics and social science.

Abstract: Understanding the intrinsic mechanisms of social platforms is an urgent
demand to maintain social stability. The rise of large language models provides
significant potential for social network simulations to capture attitude
dynamics and reproduce collective behaviors. However, existing studies mainly
focus on scaling up agent populations, neglecting the dynamic evolution of
social relationships. To address this gap, we introduce DynamiX, a novel
large-scale social network simulator dedicated to dynamic social network
modeling. DynamiX uses a dynamic hierarchy module for selecting core agents
with key characteristics at each timestep, enabling accurate alignment of
real-world adaptive switching of user roles. Furthermore, we design distinct
dynamic social relationship modeling strategies for different user types. For
opinion leaders, we propose an information-stream-based link prediction method
recommending potential users with similar stances, simulating homogeneous
connections, and autonomous behavior decisions. For ordinary users, we
construct an inequality-oriented behavior decision-making module, effectively
addressing unequal social interactions and capturing the patterns of
relationship adjustments driven by multi-dimensional factors. Experimental
results demonstrate that DynamiX exhibits marked improvements in attitude
evolution simulation and collective behavior analysis compared to static
networks. Besides, DynamiX opens a new theoretical perspective on follower
growth prediction, providing empirical evidence for opinion leaders
cultivation.

Conclusion: 城市形态在交通选择中起关键作用，研究为可持续城市政策设计提供了实证支持。

Abstract: Urban morphology has long been recognized as a factor shaping human mobility,
yet comparative and formal classifications of urban form across metropolitan
areas remain limited. Building on theoretical principles of urban structure and
advances in unsupervised learning, we systematically classified the built
environment of nine U.S. metropolitan areas using structural indicators such as
density, connectivity, and spatial configuration. The resulting morphological
types were linked to mobility patterns through descriptive statistics, marginal
effects estimation, and post hoc statistical testing. Here we show that
distinct urban forms are systematically associated with different mobility
behaviors, such as reticular morphologies being linked to significantly higher
public transport use (marginal effect = 0.49) and reduced car dependence
(-0.41), while organic forms are associated with increased car usage (0.44),
and substantial declines in public transport (-0.47) and active mobility
(-0.30). These effects are statistically robust (p < 1e-19), highlighting that
the spatial configuration of urban areas plays a fundamental role in shaping
transportation choices. Our findings extend previous work by offering a
reproducible framework for classifying urban form and demonstrate the added
value of morphological analysis in comparative urban research. These results
suggest that urban form should be treated as a key variable in mobility
planning and provide empirical support for incorporating spatial typologies
into sustainable urban policy design.

Abstract: This paper investigates joint channel estimation and positioning in
near-field sparse extra-large multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO)
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. To achieve
cooperative gains between channel estimation and positioning, we propose a deep
learning-based two-stage framework comprising positioning and channel
estimation. In the positioning stage, the user's coordinates are predicted and
utilized in the channel estimation stage, thereby enhancing the accuracy of
channel estimation. Within this framework, we propose a U-shaped Mamba
architecture for channel estimation and positioning, termed as CP-Mamba. This
network integrates the strengths of the Mamba model with the structural
advantages of U-shaped convolutional networks, enabling effective capture of
local spatial features and long-range temporal dependencies of the channel.
Numerical simulation results demonstrate that the proposed two-stage approach
with CP-Mamba architecture outperforms existing baseline methods. Moreover,
sparse arrays (SA) exhibit significantly superior performance in both channel
estimation and positioning accuracy compared to conventional compact arrays.

Conclusion: NeuroCLIP提供了一种更稳健可靠的生物标志物，对成瘾神经科学研究和临床评估有重要价值。

Abstract: Methamphetamine dependence poses a significant global health challenge, yet
its assessment and the evaluation of treatments like repetitive transcranial
magnetic stimulation (rTMS) frequently depend on subjective self-reports, which
may introduce uncertainties. While objective neuroimaging modalities such as
electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)
offer alternatives, their individual limitations and the reliance on
conventional, often hand-crafted, feature extraction can compromise the
reliability of derived biomarkers. To overcome these limitations, we propose
NeuroCLIP, a novel deep learning framework integrating simultaneously recorded
EEG and fNIRS data through a progressive learning strategy. This approach
offers a robust and trustworthy biomarker for methamphetamine addiction.
Validation experiments show that NeuroCLIP significantly improves
discriminative capabilities among the methamphetamine-dependent individuals and
healthy controls compared to models using either EEG or only fNIRS alone.
Furthermore, the proposed framework facilitates objective, brain-based
evaluation of rTMS treatment efficacy, demonstrating measurable shifts in
neural patterns towards healthy control profiles after treatment. Critically,
we establish the trustworthiness of the multimodal data-driven biomarker by
showing its strong correlation with psychometrically validated craving scores.
These findings suggest that biomarker derived from EEG-fNIRS data via NeuroCLIP
offers enhanced robustness and reliability over single-modality approaches,
providing a valuable tool for addiction neuroscience research and potentially
improving clinical assessments.

Abstract: We propose a novel compressed sensing method to improve the depth
reconstruction accuracy and multi-target separation capability of indirect
Time-of-Flight (iToF) systems. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on
hardware modifications, complex modulation, or cumbersome data-driven
reconstruction, our method operates with a single modulation frequency and
constructs the sensing matrix using multiple phase shifts and narrow-duty-cycle
continuous waves. During matrix construction, we further account for pixel-wise
range variation caused by lens distortion, making the sensing matrix better
aligned with actual modulation response characteristics. To enhance sparse
recovery, we apply K-Means clustering to the distance response dictionary and
constrain atom selection within each cluster during the OMP process, which
effectively reduces the search space and improves solution stability.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
traditional approaches in both reconstruction accuracy and robustness, without
requiring any additional hardware changes.

Abstract: Automated analysis of lung sound auscultation is essential for monitoring
respiratory health, especially in regions facing a shortage of skilled
healthcare workers. While respiratory sound classification has been widely
studied in adults, its ap plication in pediatric populations, particularly in
children aged <6 years, remains an underexplored area. The developmental
changes in pediatric lungs considerably alter the acoustic proper ties of
respiratory sounds, necessitating specialized classification approaches
tailored to this age group. To address this, we propose a multistage hybrid
CNN-Transformer framework that combines CNN-extracted features with an
attention-based architecture to classify pediatric respiratory diseases using
scalogram images from both full recordings and individual breath events. Our
model achieved an overall score of 0.9039 in binary event classifi cation and
0.8448 in multiclass event classification by employing class-wise focal loss to
address data imbalance. At the recording level, the model attained scores of
0.720 for ternary and 0.571 for multiclass classification. These scores
outperform the previous best models by 3.81% and 5.94%, respectively. This
approach offers a promising solution for scalable pediatric respiratory disease
diagnosis, especially in resource-limited settings.

Abstract: We develop a toolbox for exact analysis of iterative algorithms on a class of
high-dimensional nonconvex optimization problems with random data. While prior
work has shown that low-dimensional statistics of (generalized) first-order
methods can be predicted by a deterministic recursion known as state evolution,
our focus is on developing such a prediction for a more general class of
algorithms. We provide a state evolution for any method whose iterations are
given by (possibly interleaved) first-order and saddle point updates, showing
two main results. First, we establish a rigorous state evolution prediction
that holds even when the updates are not coordinate-wise separable. Second, we
establish finite-sample guarantees bounding the deviation of the empirical
updates from the established state evolution. In the process, we develop a
technical toolkit that may prove useful in related problems. One component of
this toolkit is a general Hilbert space lifting technique to prove existence
and uniqueness of a convenient parameterization of the state evolution. Another
component of the toolkit combines a generic application of Bolthausen's
conditioning method with a sequential variant of Gordon's Gaussian comparison
inequality, and provides additional ingredients that enable a general
finite-sample analysis.

Result: 证明了样本与总体奇异向量的对齐差异服从Gumbel分布，并开发了去偏估计器和高功率检验方法。

Conclusion: 新方法在检测结构化替代假设时表现更优，且对非高斯噪声具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: This paper studies fine-grained singular subspace estimation in the matrix
denoising model where a deterministic low-rank signal matrix is additively
perturbed by a stochastic matrix of Gaussian noise. We establish that the
maximum Euclidean row norm (i.e., the two-to-infinity norm) of the aligned
difference between the leading sample and population singular vectors
approaches the Gumbel distribution in the large-matrix limit, under suitable
signal-to-noise conditions and after appropriate centering and scaling. We
apply our novel asymptotic distributional theory to test hypotheses of low-rank
signal structure encoded in the leading singular vectors and their
corresponding principal subspace. We provide de-biased estimators for the
corresponding nuisance signal singular values and show that our proposed
plug-in test statistic has desirable properties. Notably, compared to using the
Frobenius norm subspace distance, our test statistic based on the
two-to-infinity norm has higher power to detect structured alternatives that
differ from the null in only a few matrix entries or rows. Our main results are
obtained by a novel synthesis of and technical analysis involving entrywise
matrix perturbation analysis, extreme value theory, saddle point approximation
methods, and random matrix theory. Our contributions complement the existing
literature for matrix denoising focused on minimaxity, mean squared error
analysis, unitarily invariant distances between subspaces, component-wise
asymptotic distributional theory, and row-wise uniform error bounds. Numerical
simulations illustrate our main results and demonstrate the robustness
properties of our testing procedure to non-Gaussian noise distributions.

*Joseph Ko,Jerry Harrington,Kara Sulia,Vanessa Przybylo,Marcus van Lier-Walqui,Kara Lamb*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于机器学习的框架，从二维图像预测冰晶的三维微物理特性，取得了高精度结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冰晶的微物理特性对云的辐射特性和地球气候有重要影响，但直接测量这些特性具有挑战性。

Method: 通过3D建模生成合成冰晶，并用机器学习模型从合成图像预测密度、表面积和子弹数量。

Result: 单视角模型对密度和表面积的预测R²值分别为0.99和0.98，子弹数量的F1分数为0.91；双视角模型进一步提升了精度。

Conclusion: 该框架为从原位图像估计冰晶微物理特性提供了新方法，有助于改进微物理参数化。

Abstract: The microphysical properties of ice crystals are important because they
significantly alter the radiative properties and spatiotemporal distributions
of clouds, which in turn strongly affect Earth's climate. However, it is
challenging to measure key properties of ice crystals, such as mass or
morphological features. Here, we present a framework for predicting
three-dimensional (3D) microphysical properties of ice crystals from in situ
two-dimensional (2D) imagery. First, we computationally generate synthetic ice
crystals using 3D modeling software along with geometric parameters estimated
from the 2021 Ice Cryo-Encapsulation Balloon (ICEBall) field campaign. Then, we
use synthetic crystals to train machine learning (ML) models to predict
effective density ($\rho_{e}$), effective surface area ($A_e$), and number of
bullets ($N_b$) from synthetic rosette imagery. When tested on unseen synthetic
images, we find that our ML models can predict microphysical properties with
high accuracy. For $\rho_{e}$ and $A_e$, respectively, our best-performing
single view models achieved $R^2$ values of 0.99 and 0.98. For $N_b$, our best
single view model achieved a balanced accuracy and F1 score of 0.91. We also
quantify the marginal prediction improvements from incorporating a second view.
A stereo view ResNet-18 model reduced RMSE by 40% for both $\rho_e$ and $A_e$,
relative to a single view ResNet-18 model. For $N_b$, we find that a stereo
view ResNet-18 model improved the F1 score by 8%. This work provides a novel
ML-driven framework for estimating ice microphysical properties from in situ
imagery, which will allow for downstream constraints on microphysical
parameterizations, such as the mass-size relationship.

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLM）在战略互动中的行为，发现其与人类行为存在显著差异，并提出了一种基于经济推理的监督微调方法，以对齐LLM的经济偏好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM越来越多地自主参与经济和道德决策，理解其在战略互动中的行为变得至关重要。

Method: 使用经典经济游戏评估LLM偏好，并提出基于合成数据集的监督微调方法，以对齐两种经济偏好结构（homo economicus和homo moralis）。

Result: 微调后的LLM行为更接近对应的经济代理，并在自动驾驶道德困境和市场竞争定价中展示了不同偏好结构的影响。

Conclusion: 研究提出了一种可复制、高效且基于经济原则的方法，用于对齐AI偏好，为经济和道德决策提供了新思路。

Abstract: Understanding how large language model (LLM) agents behave in strategic
interactions is essential as these systems increasingly participate
autonomously in economically and morally consequential decisions. We evaluate
LLM preferences using canonical economic games, finding substantial deviations
from human behavior. Models like GPT-4o show excessive cooperation and limited
incentive sensitivity, while reasoning models, such as o3-mini, align more
consistently with payoff-maximizing strategies. We propose a supervised
fine-tuning pipeline that uses synthetic datasets derived from economic
reasoning to align LLM agents with economic preferences, focusing on two
stylized preference structures. In the first, utility depends only on
individual payoffs (homo economicus), while utility also depends on a notion of
Kantian universalizability in the second preference structure (homo moralis).
We find that fine-tuning based on small datasets shifts LLM agent behavior
toward the corresponding economic agent. We further assess the fine-tuned
agents' behavior in two applications: Moral dilemmas involving autonomous
vehicles and algorithmic pricing in competitive markets. These examples
illustrate how different normative objectives embedded via realizations from
structured preference structures can influence market and moral outcomes. This
work contributes a replicable, cost-efficient, and economically grounded
pipeline to align AI preferences using moral-economic principles.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种轻量级混合模型1D-CGS，结合1D-CNN的速度和GraphSAGE的拓扑表示能力，用于高效识别复杂网络中的关键节点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在准确性和计算效率之间存在权衡，需要一种更高效且准确的节点排名方法。

Method: 1D-CGS结合1D-CNN和GraphSAGE，利用节点度和平均邻居度作为输入特征，通过回归任务生成节点影响力排名。

Result: 在12个真实网络中，1D-CGS在排名准确性和运行速度上显著优于传统方法和深度学习模型。

Conclusion: 1D-CGS是一种高效且准确的节点排名方法，适用于大规模应用。

Abstract: Identifying influential nodes in complex networks is a critical task with a
wide range of applications across different domains. However, existing
approaches often face trade-offs between accuracy and computational efficiency.
To address these challenges, we propose 1D-CGS, a lightweight and effective
hybrid model that integrates the speed of one-dimensional convolutional neural
networks (1D-CNN) with the topological representation power of GraphSAGE for
efficient node ranking. The model uses a lightweight input representation built
on two straightforward and significant topological features: node degree and
average neighbor degree. These features are processed through 1D convolutions
to extract local patterns, followed by GraphSAGE layers to aggregate
neighborhood information. We formulate the node ranking task as a regression
problem and use the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model to generate
ground truth influence scores. 1D-CGS is initially trained on synthetic
networks generated by the Barabasi-Albert model and then applied to real world
networks for identifying influential nodes. Experimental evaluations on twelve
real world networks demonstrate that 1D-CGS significantly outperforms
traditional centrality measures and recent deep learning models in ranking
accuracy, while operating in very fast runtime. The proposed model achieves an
average improvement of 4.73% in Kendall's Tau correlation and 7.67% in Jaccard
Similarity over the best performing deep learning baselines. It also achieves
an average Monotonicity Index (MI) score 0.99 and produces near perfect rank
distributions, indicating highly unique and discriminative rankings.
Furthermore, all experiments confirm that 1D-CGS operates in a highly
reasonable time, running significantly faster than existing deep learning
methods, making it suitable for large scale applications.

*Margarita Leib,Nils Köbis,Ivan Soraperra*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 研究表明，人们依赖AI建议时，自私行为会受到更严厉的惩罚，而建议内容和行为本身比建议来源（AI或人类）更影响惩罚程度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI建议如何影响人们对自私行为的感知和惩罚，以及责任归属问题。

Method: 结合社会心理学理论，采用机器行为和实验经济学方法，通过预注册、经济激励实验，评估不同建议来源（AI、人类或无建议）和行为（自私或亲社会）对惩罚的影响。

Result: 亲社会行为几乎不受惩罚，自私行为则受到严厉惩罚；自私行为在亲社会建议后惩罚更重，在自私建议后惩罚较轻；AI建议下自私决策者被认为责任更大，但惩罚程度与人类建议无差异。

Conclusion: 行为和建议内容决定惩罚程度，而建议来源（AI或人类）对惩罚无显著影响。

Abstract: People increasingly rely on AI-advice when making decisions. At times, such
advice can promote selfish behavior. When individuals abide by
selfishness-promoting AI advice, how are they perceived and punished? To study
this question, we build on theories from social psychology and combine
machine-behavior and behavioral economic approaches. In a pre-registered,
financially-incentivized experiment, evaluators could punish real
decision-makers who (i) received AI, human, or no advice. The advice (ii)
encouraged selfish or prosocial behavior, and decision-makers (iii) behaved
selfishly or, in a control condition, behaved prosocially. Evaluators further
assigned responsibility to decision-makers and their advisors. Results revealed
that (i) prosocial behavior was punished very little, whereas selfish behavior
was punished much more. Focusing on selfish behavior, (ii) compared to
receiving no advice, selfish behavior was penalized more harshly after
prosocial advice and more leniently after selfish advice. Lastly, (iii) whereas
selfish decision-makers were seen as more responsible when they followed AI
compared to human advice, punishment between the two advice sources did not
vary. Overall, behavior and advice content shape punishment, whereas the advice
source does not.

Motivation: 解决AI对齐问题中的规范不确定性，比较民主与专家主导方法的合理性。

Method: 分析民主和专家主导方法的工具性和非工具性理由，探讨其填补规范不确定性的能力。

Result: 发现民主和专家主导方法各有不足，建议结合两者并加入制度保障。

Conclusion: 混合框架可能是解决AI对齐问题的更优方案。

Abstract: The AI alignment problem comprises both technical and normative dimensions.
While technical solutions focus on implementing normative constraints in AI
systems, the normative problem concerns determining what these constraints
should be. This paper examines justifications for democratic approaches to the
normative problem -- where affected stakeholders determine AI alignment -- as
opposed to epistocratic approaches that defer to normative experts. We analyze
both instrumental justifications (democratic approaches produce better
outcomes) and non-instrumental justifications (democratic approaches prevent
illegitimate authority or coercion). We argue that normative and metanormative
uncertainty create a justificatory gap that democratic approaches aim to fill
through political rather than theoretical justification. However, we identify
significant challenges for democratic approaches, particularly regarding the
prevention of illegitimate coercion through AI alignment. Our analysis suggests
that neither purely epistocratic nor purely democratic approaches may be
sufficient on their own, pointing toward hybrid frameworks that combine expert
judgment with participatory input alongside institutional safeguards against AI
monopolization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 仇恨表情包通过修改文本或图像逃避检测，现有模型在此类攻击下表现不佳，需要提升鲁棒性。

Method: 结合四种文本攻击和三种图像干扰，测试了MemeCLIP和MemeBLIP2两种检测器，并引入TDA增强MemeBLIP2。

Result: MemeCLIP表现更稳定，MemeBLIP2对文本攻击敏感，但加入TDA后成为最鲁棒的模型。

Conclusion: 当前多模态安全模型存在漏洞，轻量级模块如TDA是提升防御的有效途径。

Abstract: Hateful memes aimed at LGBTQ\,+ communities often evade detection by tweaking
either the caption, the image, or both. We build the first robustness benchmark
for this setting, pairing four realistic caption attacks with three canonical
image corruptions and testing all combinations on the PrideMM dataset. Two
state-of-the-art detectors, MemeCLIP and MemeBLIP2, serve as case studies, and
we introduce a lightweight \textbf{Text Denoising Adapter (TDA)} to enhance the
latter's resilience. Across the grid, MemeCLIP degrades more gently, while
MemeBLIP2 is particularly sensitive to the caption edits that disrupt its
language processing. However, the addition of the TDA not only remedies this
weakness but makes MemeBLIP2 the most robust model overall. Ablations reveal
that all systems lean heavily on text, but architectural choices and
pre-training data significantly impact robustness. Our benchmark exposes where
current multimodal safety models crack and demonstrates that targeted,
lightweight modules like the TDA offer a powerful path towards stronger
defences.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs在评估本科毕业论文时仅提供单一分数，忽略了多维度标准和教育目标，而教育理论在自动化评估中未充分利用。PEMUTA旨在填补这一研究空白。

Method: PEMUTA基于Vygotsky理论和Bloom分类法，采用分层提示方案评估六个维度（SLOWPR），并结合少量示例提示和角色扮演提示技术。

Result: 实验表明，PEMUTA与专家评估高度一致，展现了在多维度、教育导向评估中的潜力。

Conclusion: PEMUTA为本科毕业论文提供了精细化、教育理论支持的自动化评估框架，具有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: The undergraduate thesis (UGTE) plays an indispensable role in assessing a
student's cumulative academic development throughout their college years.
Although large language models (LLMs) have advanced education intelligence,
they typically focus on holistic assessment with only one single evaluation
score, but ignore the intricate nuances across multifaceted criteria, limiting
their ability to reflect structural criteria, pedagogical objectives, and
diverse academic competencies. Meanwhile, pedagogical theories have long
informed manual UGTE evaluation through multi-dimensional assessment of
cognitive development, disciplinary thinking, and academic performance, yet
remain underutilized in automated settings. Motivated by the research gap, we
pioneer PEMUTA, a pedagogically-enriched framework that effectively activates
domain-specific knowledge from LLMs for multi-granular UGTE assessment. Guided
by Vygotsky's theory and Bloom's Taxonomy, PEMUTA incorporates a hierarchical
prompting scheme that evaluates UGTEs across six fine-grained dimensions:
Structure, Logic, Originality, Writing, Proficiency, and Rigor (SLOWPR),
followed by holistic synthesis. Two in-context learning techniques, \ie,
few-shot prompting and role-play prompting, are also incorporated to further
enhance alignment with expert judgments without fine-tuning. We curate a
dataset of authentic UGTEs with expert-provided SLOWPR-aligned annotations to
support multi-granular UGTE assessment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
PEMUTA achieves strong alignment with expert evaluations, and exhibits strong
potential for fine-grained, pedagogically-informed UGTE evaluations.

Motivation: 随着ML模型和数据集的增长，能源成本急剧上升，绿色AI成为重要研究课题。当前缺乏与成熟ICT子领域（如质量模型和服务级别协议）的整合，限制了模型能源描述的自动分析和应用。

Method: 提出可持续质量模型，结合质量模型和绿色AI倡议，开发DSL定义ML模型的可持续性（包括能源成本），并扩展Model Cards。

Result: DSL能精确描述ML模型的可持续性，信息可导出为扩展版Model Cards，同时支持其他自动化流程。

Conclusion: 通过可持续质量模型和DSL，为ML模型的可持续性提供了标准化描述方法，支持自动分析和比较。

Abstract: The growth of machine learning (ML) models and associated datasets triggers a
consequent dramatic increase in energy costs for the use and training of these
models. In the current context of environmental awareness and global
sustainability concerns involving ICT, Green AI is becoming an important
research topic. Initiatives like the AI Energy Score Ratings are a good
example. Nevertheless, these benchmarking attempts are still to be integrated
with existing work on Quality Models and Service-Level Agreements common in
other, more mature, ICT subfields. This limits the (automatic) analysis of this
model energy descriptions and their use in (semi)automatic model comparison,
selection, and certification processes. We aim to leverage the concept of
quality models and merge it with existing ML model reporting initiatives and
Green/Frugal AI proposals to formalize a Sustainable Quality Model for AI/ML
models. As a first step, we propose a new Domain-Specific Language to precisely
define the sustainability aspects of an ML model (including the energy costs
for its different tasks). This information can then be exported as an extended
version of the well-known Model Cards initiative while, at the same time, being
formal enough to be input of any other model description automatic process.

Conclusion: 医疗领域应用AI和LLMs需权衡利弊，确保安全性和有效性。

Abstract: The medical ecosystem consists of the training of new clinicians and
researchers, the practice of clinical medicine, and areas of adjacent research.
There are many aspects of these domains that could benefit from the application
of task automation and programmatic assistance. Machine learning and artificial
intelligence techniques, including large language models (LLMs), have been
promised to deliver on healthcare innovation, improving care speed and
accuracy, and reducing the burden on staff for manual interventions. However,
LLMs have no understanding of objective truth that is based in reality. They
also represent real risks to the disclosure of protected information when used
by clinicians and researchers. The use of AI in medicine in general, and the
deployment of LLMs in particular, therefore requires careful consideration and
thoughtful application to reap the benefits of these technologies while
avoiding the dangers in each context.

Result: 可编程虚拟人类模型能够模拟药物从分子到表型的作用，优化早期疗效和安全性。

Conclusion: 可编程虚拟人类为药物发现提供了新范式，但仍需解决关键挑战以实现其潜力。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has sparked immense interest in drug discovery,
but most current approaches only digitize existing high-throughput experiments.
They remain constrained by conventional pipelines. As a result, they do not
address the fundamental challenges of predicting drug effects in humans.
Similarly, biomedical digital twins, largely grounded in real-world data and
mechanistic models, are tailored for late-phase drug development and lack the
resolution to model molecular interactions or their systemic consequences,
limiting their impact in early-stage discovery. This disconnect between early
discovery and late development is one of the main drivers of high failure rates
in drug discovery. The true promise of AI lies not in augmenting current
experiments but in enabling virtual experiments that are impossible in the real
world: testing novel compounds directly in silico in the human body. Recent
advances in AI, high-throughput perturbation assays, and single-cell and
spatial omics across species now make it possible to construct programmable
virtual humans: dynamic, multiscale models that simulate drug actions from
molecular to phenotypic levels. By bridging the translational gap, programmable
virtual humans offer a transformative path to optimize therapeutic efficacy and
safety earlier than ever before. This perspective introduces the concept of
programmable virtual humans, explores their roles in a new paradigm of drug
discovery centered on human physiology, and outlines key opportunities,
challenges, and roadmaps for their realization.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and BERT have revolutionized natural
language processing (NLP), yet their environmental costs remain dangerously
overlooked. This article critiques the sustainability of LLMs, quantifying
their carbon footprint, water usage, and contribution to e-waste through case
studies of models such as GPT-4 and energy-efficient alternatives like Mistral
7B. Training a single LLM can emit carbon dioxide equivalent to hundreds of
cars driven annually, while data centre cooling exacerbates water scarcity in
vulnerable regions. Systemic challenges corporate greenwashing, redundant model
development, and regulatory voids perpetuate harm, disproportionately burdening
marginalized communities in the Global South. However, pathways exist for
sustainable NLP: technical innovations (e.g., model pruning, quantum
computing), policy reforms (carbon taxes, mandatory emissions reporting), and
cultural shifts prioritizing necessity over novelty. By analysing industry
leaders (Google, Microsoft) and laggards (Amazon), this work underscores the
urgency of ethical accountability and global cooperation. Without immediate
action, AIs ecological toll risks outpacing its societal benefits. The article
concludes with a call to align technological progress with planetary
boundaries, advocating for equitable, transparent, and regenerative AI systems
that prioritize both human and environmental well-being.

Abstract: Understanding clients' thoughts and beliefs is fundamental in counseling, yet
current evaluations of LLM therapists often fail to assess this ability.
Existing evaluation methods rely on client simulators that clearly disclose
internal states to the therapist, making it difficult to determine whether an
LLM therapist can uncover unexpressed perspectives. To address this limitation,
we introduce MindVoyager, a novel evaluation framework featuring a controllable
and realistic client simulator which dynamically adapts itself based on the
ongoing counseling session, offering a more realistic and challenging
evaluation environment. We further introduce evaluation metrics that assess the
exploration ability of LLM therapists by measuring their thorough understanding
of client's beliefs and thoughts.

Abstract: This paper presents a case study in the use of a large language model to
generate a fictional Buddhist "sutr"', and offers a detailed analysis of the
resulting text from a philosophical and literary point of view. The conceptual
subtlety, rich imagery, and density of allusion found in the text make it hard
to causally dismiss on account of its mechanistic origin. This raises questions
about how we, as a society, should come to terms with the potentially

Abstract: Symbolic regression automates the process of learning closed-form
mathematical models from data. Standard approaches to symbolic regression, as
well as newer deep learning approaches, rely on heuristic model selection
criteria, heuristic regularization, and heuristic exploration of model space.
Here, we discuss the probabilistic approach to symbolic regression, an
alternative to such heuristic approaches with direct connections to information
theory and statistical physics. We show how the probabilistic approach
establishes model plausibility from basic considerations and explicit
approximations, and how it provides guarantees of performance that heuristic
approaches lack. We also discuss how the probabilistic approach compels us to
consider model ensembles, as opposed to single models.

Abstract: Solder joint reliability related to failures due to thermomechanical loading
is a critically important yet physically complex engineering problem. As a
result, simulated behavior is oftentimes computationally expensive. In an
increasingly data-driven world, the usage of efficient data-driven design
schemes is a popular choice. Among them, Bayesian optimization (BO) with
Gaussian process regression is one of the most important representatives. The
authors argue that computational savings can be obtained from exploiting
thorough surrogate modeling and selecting a design candidate based on multiple
acquisition functions. This is feasible due to the relatively low computational
cost, compared to the expensive simulation objective. This paper addresses the
shortcomings in the adjacent literature by providing and implementing a novel
heuristic framework to perform BO with adaptive hyperparameters across the
various optimization iterations. Adaptive BO is subsequently compared to
regular BO when faced with synthetic objective minimization problems. The
results show the efficiency of adaptive BO when compared any worst-performing
regular Bayesian schemes. As an engineering use case, the solder joint
reliability problem is tackled by minimizing the accumulated non-linear creep
strain under a cyclic thermal load. Results show that adaptive BO outperforms
regular BO by 3% on average at any given computational budget threshold,
critically saving half of the computational expense budget. This practical
result underlines the methodological potential of the adaptive Bayesian
data-driven methodology to achieve better results and cut optimization-related
expenses. Lastly, in order to promote the reproducibility of the results, the
data-driven implementations are made available on an open-source basis.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Bag-of-Coins (BoC)的非参数统计测试，用于评估分类器内部预测一致性，发现ViTs的置信度校准效果显著优于CNNs。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代神经网络的高准确率背后，置信度评分校准不足，限制了其在关键应用中的可靠性。现有方法通常仅后处理输出，未深入分析预测的内部一致性。

Method: 引入BoC测试，将置信度估计重新定义为频率假设检验，检查模型预测的内部一致性。

Result: 在ViTs上，BoC测试实现了近乎完美的校准（ECE为0.0212），比基线提升88%；而在CNNs（如ResNet）上，揭示了预测与内部结构的不一致性。

Conclusion: BoC不仅是校准工具，还能作为诊断工具，揭示不同架构在不确定性表示上的差异。

Abstract: Modern neural networks, despite their high accuracy, often produce poorly
calibrated confidence scores, limiting their reliability in high-stakes
applications. Existing calibration methods typically post-process model outputs
without interrogating the internal consistency of the predictions themselves.
In this work, we introduce a novel, non-parametric statistical probe, the
Bag-of-Coins (BoC) test, that examines the internal consistency of a
classifier's logits. The BoC test reframes confidence estimation as a
frequentist hypothesis test: does the model's top-ranked class win 1-v-1
contests against random competitors at a rate consistent with its own stated
softmax probability? When applied to modern deep learning architectures, this
simple probe reveals a fundamental dichotomy. On Vision Transformers (ViTs),
the BoC output serves as a state-of-the-art confidence score, achieving
near-perfect calibration with an ECE of 0.0212, an 88% improvement over a
temperature-scaled baseline. Conversely, on Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) like ResNet, the probe reveals a deep inconsistency between the model's
predictions and its internal logit structure, a property missed by traditional
metrics. We posit that BoC is not merely a calibration method, but a new
diagnostic tool for understanding and exposing the differing ways that popular
architectures represent uncertainty.

Method: 采用稀疏正则化优化DMD框架，提取局部化空间结构的模态。

Result: 在合成和真实数据（如光波导、量子力学和海表温度）中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 稀疏模式DMD能无监督地构建频谱的离散和连续部分，区分局部与全局模态。

Abstract: The dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) is a data-driven approach that extracts
the dominant features from spatiotemporal data. In this work, we introduce
sparse-mode DMD, a new variant of the optimized DMD framework that specifically
leverages sparsity-promoting regularization in order to approximate DMD modes
which have localized spatial structure. The algorithm maintains the
noise-robust properties of optimized DMD while disambiguating between modes
which are spatially local versus global in nature. In many applications, such
modes are associated with discrete and continuous spectra respectively, thus
allowing the algorithm to explicitly construct, in an unsupervised manner, the
distinct portions of the spectrum. We demonstrate this by analyzing synthetic
and real-world systems, including examples from optical waveguides, quantum
mechanics, and sea surface temperature data.

Result: 研究为PD研究和临床应用提供了模型性能的实用指导。

Conclusion: 混合模型（尤其是GNMM和NME）在预测PD进展方面表现出潜力，优于传统LMMs。

Abstract: Predicting Parkinson's Disease (PD) progression is crucial, and voice
biomarkers offer a non-invasive method for tracking symptom severity (UPDRS
scores) through telemonitoring. Analyzing this longitudinal data is challenging
due to within-subject correlations and complex, nonlinear patient-specific
progression patterns. This study benchmarks LMMs against two advanced hybrid
approaches: the Generalized Neural Network Mixed Model (GNMM) (Mandel 2021),
which embeds a neural network within a GLMM structure, and the Neural Mixed
Effects (NME) model (Wortwein 2023), allowing nonlinear subject-specific
parameters throughout the network. Using the Oxford Parkinson's telemonitoring
voice dataset, we evaluate these models' performance in predicting Total UPDRS
to offer practical guidance for PD research and clinical applications.

Result: DP-SGD输出的渐近方差可分解为统计、采样和隐私诱导三部分；数值分析显示置信区间在保持隐私的同时达到名义覆盖率。

Conclusion: 论文成功填补了理论空白，提出的方法在隐私保护下实现了有效的统计推断。

Abstract: Privacy preservation in machine learning, particularly through Differentially
Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD), is critical for sensitive data
analysis. However, existing statistical inference methods for SGD predominantly
focus on cyclic subsampling, while DP-SGD requires randomized subsampling. This
paper first bridges this gap by establishing the asymptotic properties of SGD
under the randomized rule and extending these results to DP-SGD. For the output
of DP-SGD, we show that the asymptotic variance decomposes into statistical,
sampling, and privacy-induced components. Two methods are proposed for
constructing valid confidence intervals: the plug-in method and the random
scaling method. We also perform extensive numerical analysis, which shows that
the proposed confidence intervals achieve nominal coverage rates while
maintaining privacy.

Result: 该方法在多元设置中更接近条件覆盖率，且计算效率更高。

Conclusion: 高斯分数方法为共形预测提供了更高效且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: While achieving exact conditional coverage in conformal prediction is
unattainable without making strong, untestable regularity assumptions, the
promise of conformal prediction hinges on finding approximations to conditional
guarantees that are realizable in practice. A promising direction for obtaining
conditional dependence for conformal sets--in particular capturing
heteroskedasticity--is through estimating the conditional density
$\mathbb{P}_{Y|X}$ and conformalizing its level sets. Previous work in this
vein has focused on nonconformity scores based on the empirical cumulative
distribution function (CDF). Such scores are, however, computationally costly,
typically requiring expensive sampling methods. To avoid the need for sampling,
we observe that the CDF-based score reduces to a Mahalanobis distance in the
case of Gaussian scores, yielding a closed-form expression that can be directly
conformalized. Moreover, the use of a Gaussian-based score opens the door to a
number of extensions of the basic conformal method; in particular, we show how
to construct conformal sets with missing output values, refine conformal sets
as partial information about $Y$ becomes available, and construct conformal
sets on transformations of the output space. Finally, empirical results
indicate that our approach produces conformal sets that more closely
approximate conditional coverage in multivariate settings compared to
alternative methods.

Conclusion: LSCI为神经算子模型提供了一种有效的局部不确定性量化方法，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Operator models are regression algorithms for functional data and have become
a key tool for emulating large-scale dynamical systems. Recent advances in deep
neural operators have dramatically improved the accuracy and scalability of
operator modeling, but lack an inherent notion of predictive uncertainty. We
introduce Local Spectral Conformal Inference (LSCI), a new framework for
locally adaptive, distribution-free uncertainty quantification for neural
operator models. LSCI uses projection-based depth scoring and localized
conformal inference to generate function-valued prediction sets with
statistical guarantees. We prove approximate finite-sample marginal coverage
under local exchangeability, and demonstrate significant gains in adaptivity
and coverage across synthetic and real-world operator learning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能工厂中自动驾驶配送车（ADV）的定位模块计算密集，优化其能耗和成本是关键。

Method: 利用5G同步信号块（SSB）进行定位，采用基于AoA的MUSIC算法，并通过自适应策略平衡能耗与精度。

Result: 相比非自适应系统，能耗降低43.09%，定位精度保持在30厘米以内，同时显著降低基础设施和运营成本。

Conclusion: ACCESS-AV在智能工厂环境中具有可持续性和可行性，为ADV定位提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous Delivery Vehicles (ADVs) are increasingly used for transporting
goods in 5G network-enabled smart factories, with the compute-intensive
localization module presenting a significant opportunity for optimization. We
propose ACCESS-AV, an energy-efficient Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I)
localization framework that leverages existing 5G infrastructure in smart
factory environments. By opportunistically accessing the periodically broadcast
5G Synchronization Signal Blocks (SSBs) for localization, ACCESS-AV obviates
the need for dedicated Roadside Units (RSUs) or additional onboard sensors to
achieve energy efficiency as well as cost reduction. We implement an
Angle-of-Arrival (AoA)-based estimation method using the Multiple Signal
Classification (MUSIC) algorithm, optimized for resource-constrained ADV
platforms through an adaptive communication-computation strategy that
dynamically balances energy consumption with localization accuracy based on
environmental conditions such as Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and vehicle
velocity. Experimental results demonstrate that ACCESS-AV achieves an average
energy reduction of 43.09% compared to non-adaptive systems employing AoA
algorithms such as vanilla MUSIC, ESPRIT, and Root-MUSIC. It maintains sub-30
cm localization accuracy while also delivering substantial reductions in
infrastructure and operational costs, establishing its viability for
sustainable smart factory environments.

Abstract: Accurate and robust localization is critical for the safe operation of
Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs), especially in complex urban
environments where Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals are
unreliable. This paper presents a novel vision-based cooperative localization
algorithm that leverages onboard cameras and Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X)
communication to enable CAVs to estimate their poses, even in occlusion-heavy
scenarios such as busy intersections. In particular, we propose a novel
decentralized observer for a group of connected agents that includes landmark
agents (static or moving) in the environment with known positions and vehicle
agents that need to estimate their poses (both positions and orientations).
Assuming that (i) there are at least three landmark agents in the environment,
(ii) each vehicle agent can measure its own angular and translational
velocities as well as relative bearings to at least three neighboring landmarks
or vehicles, and (iii) neighboring vehicles can communicate their pose
estimates, each vehicle can estimate its own pose using the proposed
decentralized observer. We prove that the origin of the estimation error is
locally exponentially stable under the proposed observer, provided that the
minimal observability conditions are satisfied. Moreover, we evaluate the
proposed approach through experiments with real 1/10th-scale connected vehicles
and large-scale simulations, demonstrating its scalability and validating the
theoretical guarantees in practical scenarios.

Motivation: G&CNETs为航天器提供了一种可微分的端到端G&C架构表示，但缺乏对BC和RL两种训练范式的直接比较。

Method: 引入了一种针对G&CNETs的RL训练框架，结合解耦动作和控制频率以及奖励重分配策略，并与BC进行系统比较。

Result: BC在确定性环境中表现优异，但受限于训练数据质量；RL在随机条件下更具适应性，并能发现全局最优策略。

Conclusion: RL在G&CNETs训练中展现出超越BC的潜力，尤其在处理随机性和优化专家演示方面。

Abstract: Guidance & control networks (G&CNETs) provide a promising alternative to
on-board guidance and control (G&C) architectures for spacecraft, offering a
differentiable, end-to-end representation of the guidance and control
architecture. When training G&CNETs, two predominant paradigms emerge:
behavioural cloning (BC), which mimics optimal trajectories, and reinforcement
learning (RL), which learns optimal behaviour through trials and errors.
Although both approaches have been adopted in G&CNET related literature, direct
comparisons are notably absent. To address this, we conduct a systematic
evaluation of BC and RL specifically for training G&CNETs on continuous-thrust
spacecraft trajectory optimisation tasks. We introduce a novel RL training
framework tailored to G&CNETs, incorporating decoupled action and control
frequencies alongside reward redistribution strategies to stabilise training
and to provide a fair comparison. Our results show that BC-trained G&CNETs
excel at closely replicating expert policy behaviour, and thus the optimal
control structure of a deterministic environment, but can be negatively
constrained by the quality and coverage of the training dataset. In contrast
RL-trained G&CNETs, beyond demonstrating a superior adaptability to stochastic
conditions, can also discover solutions that improve upon suboptimal expert
demonstrations, sometimes revealing globally optimal strategies that eluded the
generation of training samples.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs在投资分析中的特定偏好和确认偏误，为实际应用中的模型调整提供了依据。

Abstract: In finance, Large Language Models (LLMs) face frequent knowledge conflicts
due to discrepancies between pre-trained parametric knowledge and real-time
market data. These conflicts become particularly problematic when LLMs are
deployed in real-world investment services, where misalignment between a
model's embedded preferences and those of the financial institution can lead to
unreliable recommendations. Yet little research has examined what investment
views LLMs actually hold. We propose an experimental framework to investigate
such conflicts, offering the first quantitative analysis of confirmation bias
in LLM-based investment analysis. Using hypothetical scenarios with balanced
and imbalanced arguments, we extract models' latent preferences and measure
their persistence. Focusing on sector, size, and momentum, our analysis reveals
distinct, model-specific tendencies. In particular, we observe a consistent
preference for large-cap stocks and contrarian strategies across most models.
These preferences often harden into confirmation bias, with models clinging to
initial judgments despite counter-evidence.

Abstract: The rapid growth of crypto markets has opened new opportunities for
investors, but at the same time exposed them to high volatility. To address the
challenge of managing dynamic portfolios in such an environment, this paper
presents a practical application of a multi-agent system designed to
autonomously construct and evaluate crypto-asset allocations. Using data on
daily frequencies of the ten most capitalized cryptocurrencies from 2020 to
2025, we compare two automated investment strategies. These are a static equal
weighting strategy and a rolling-window optimization strategy, both implemented
to maximize the evaluation metrics of the Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), such
as Expected Return, Sharpe and Sortino ratios, while minimizing volatility.
Each step of the process is handled by dedicated agents, integrated through a
collaborative architecture in Crew AI. The results show that the dynamic
optimization strategy achieves significantly better performance in terms of
risk-adjusted returns, both in-sample and out-of-sample. This highlights the
benefits of adaptive techniques in portfolio management, particularly in
volatile markets such as cryptocurrency markets. The following methodology
proposed also demonstrates how multi-agent systems can provide scalable,
auditable, and flexible solutions in financial automation.

Result: 本体包含132个类、12个对象属性和17个数据属性，成功验证了所有测试案例的推理能力。

Conclusion: NIRS本体为临床文档、数据模型集成和NIRS结果分析提供了统一框架。

Abstract: Objective: Develop a Non Invasive Respiratory Support (NIRS) ontology to
support knowledge representation in acute care settings.
  Materials and Methods: We developed the NIRS ontology using Web Ontology
Language (OWL) semantics and Protege to organize clinical concepts and
relationships. To enable rule-based clinical reasoning beyond hierarchical
structures, we added Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) rules. We evaluated
logical reasoning by adding 17 hypothetical patient clinical scenarios. We used
SPARQL queries and data from the Electronic Intensive Care Unit (eICU)
Collaborative Research Database to retrieve and test targeted inferences.
  Results: The ontology has 132 classes, 12 object properties, and 17 data
properties across 882 axioms that establish concept relationships. To
standardize clinical concepts, we added 350 annotations, including descriptive
definitions based on controlled vocabularies. SPARQL queries successfully
validated all test cases (rules) by retrieving appropriate patient outcomes,
for instance, a patient treated with HFNC (high-flow nasal cannula) for 2 hours
due to acute respiratory failure may avoid endotracheal intubation.
  Discussion: The NIRS ontology formally represents domain-specific concepts,
including ventilation modalities, patient characteristics, therapy parameters,
and outcomes. SPARQL query evaluations on clinical scenarios confirmed the
ability of the ontology to support rule based reasoning and therapy
recommendations, providing a foundation for consistent documentation practices,
integration into clinical data models, and advanced analysis of NIRS outcomes.
  Conclusion: We unified NIRS concepts into an ontological framework and
demonstrated its applicability through the evaluation of hypothetical patient
scenarios and alignment with standardized vocabularies.

Motivation: 大多数网页不符合可访问性指南，导致部分用户无法访问内容，手动修复成本高。

Method: 提出新的分类法（语法、语义、布局），结合工具和LLM检测与修复违规。

Result: AccessGuru平均违规分数降低84%，优于之前方法的50%。

Conclusion: AccessGuru有效解决了网页可访问性违规的自动检测与修复问题。

Abstract: The vast majority of Web pages fail to comply with established Web
accessibility guidelines, excluding a range of users with diverse abilities
from interacting with their content. Making Web pages accessible to all users
requires dedicated expertise and additional manual efforts from Web page
providers. To lower their efforts and promote inclusiveness, we aim to
automatically detect and correct Web accessibility violations in HTML code.
While previous work has made progress in detecting certain types of
accessibility violations, the problem of automatically detecting and correcting
accessibility violations remains an open challenge that we address. We
introduce a novel taxonomy classifying Web accessibility violations into three
key categories - Syntactic, Semantic, and Layout. This taxonomy provides a
structured foundation for developing our detection and correction method and
redefining evaluation metrics. We propose a novel method, AccessGuru, which
combines existing accessibility testing tools and Large Language Models (LLMs)
to detect violations and applies taxonomy-driven prompting strategies to
correct all three categories. To evaluate these capabilities, we develop a
benchmark of real-world Web accessibility violations. Our benchmark quantifies
syntactic and layout compliance and judges semantic accuracy through
comparative analysis with human expert corrections. Evaluation against our
benchmark shows that AccessGuru achieves up to 84% average violation score
decrease, significantly outperforming prior methods that achieve at most 50%.

models requires a significant amount of resources. Fine-tuning techniques have
been developed to adapt pre-trained LLMs to specific tasks, such as APR, and
enhance their performance at far lower computational costs than training from
scratch. In this study, we empirically investigate the impact of various
fine-tuning techniques on the performance of LLMs used for APR. Our experiments
provide insights into the performance of a selection of state-of-the-art LLMs
pre-trained on code. The evaluation is done on three popular APR benchmarks
(i.e., QuixBugs, Defects4J and HumanEval-Java) and considers six different LLMs
with varying parameter sizes (resp. CodeGen, CodeT5, StarCoder, DeepSeekCoder,
Bloom, and CodeLlama-2). We consider three training regimens: no fine-tuning,
full fine-tuning, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) using LoRA and
IA3. We observe that full fine-tuning techniques decrease the benchmarking
performance of various models due to different data distributions and
overfitting. By using parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, we restrict
models in the amount of trainable parameters and achieve better results.

### [591] [Defining ethically sourced code generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19743)
*Zhuolin Xu,Chenglin Li,Qiushi Li,Shin Hwei Tan*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的概念——伦理源代码生成（ES-CodeGen），旨在通过伦理和可持续的实践管理代码生成模型的开发过程。通过文献综述和从业者调查，确定了11个ES-CodeGen的维度，并揭示了相关后果、工件和阶段。研究发现从业者常忽视社会相关维度，但调查有助于提升对ES-CodeGen的理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着代码生成模型的普及，确保其开发过程符合伦理和可持续性变得至关重要。研究旨在填补这一领域的空白，推动伦理源代码生成的发展。

Method: 通过两阶段文献综述（803篇论文）和从业者调查（32人，包括6名GitHub开发者），确定了ES-CodeGen的维度和相关因素。

Result: 确定了11个ES-CodeGen维度，新增了代码质量维度，并揭示了相关后果、工件和阶段。从业者普遍认为调查提升了他们对ES-CodeGen的理解。

Conclusion: 研究呼吁关注ES-CodeGen中的伦理问题，并强调社会相关维度的重要性，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Several code generation models have been proposed to help reduce time and
effort in solving software-related tasks. To ensure responsible AI, there are
growing interests over various ethical issues (e.g., unclear licensing,
privacy, fairness, and environment impact). These studies have the overarching
goal of ensuring ethically sourced generation, which has gained growing
attentions in speech synthesis and image generation. In this paper, we
introduce the novel notion of Ethically Sourced Code Generation (ES-CodeGen) to
refer to managing all processes involved in code generation model development
from data collection to post-deployment via ethical and sustainable practices.
To build a taxonomy of ES-CodeGen, we perform a two-phase literature review
where we read 803 papers across various domains and specific to AI-based code
generation. We identified 71 relevant papers with 10 initial dimensions of
ES-CodeGen. To refine our dimensions and gain insights on consequences of
ES-CodeGen, we surveyed 32 practitioners, which include six developers who
submitted GitHub issues to opt-out from the Stack dataset (these impacted users
have real-world experience of ethically sourcing issues in code generation
models). The results lead to 11 dimensions of ES-CodeGen with a new dimension
on code quality as practitioners have noted its importance. We also identified
consequences, artifacts, and stages relevant to ES-CodeGen. Our post-survey
reflection showed that most practitioners tend to ignore social-related
dimensions despite their importance. Most practitioners either agreed or
strongly agreed that our survey help improve their understanding of ES-CodeGen.
Our study calls for attentions of various ethical issues towards ES-CodeGen.

*Le Deng,Xiaoxue Ren,Chao Ni,Ming Liang,David Lo,Zhongxin Liu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需依赖导入即可推断内部API信息的方法，显著提升了代码补全的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以有效利用未显式导入的内部API信息，影响了代码补全的准确性。

Method: 通过构建API的使用示例和语义描述扩展API表示，建立知识库供LLMs生成补全。同时引入ProjBench基准。

Result: 在ProjBench和CrossCodeEval上，代码精确匹配提升22.72%，标识符精确匹配提升18.31%。与现有基线结合后，代码匹配提升47.80%，标识符匹配提升35.55%。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了代码补全的准确性，尤其在处理未显式导入的API时表现突出。

Abstract: Project-specific code completion is a critical task that leverages context
from a project to generate accurate code. State-of-the-art methods use
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs) and
project information for code completion. However, they often struggle to
incorporate internal API information, which is crucial for accuracy, especially
when APIs are not explicitly imported in the file.
  To address this, we propose a method to infer internal API information
without relying on imports. Our method extends the representation of APIs by
constructing usage examples and semantic descriptions, building a knowledge
base for LLMs to generate relevant completions. We also introduce ProjBench, a
benchmark that avoids leaked imports and consists of large-scale real-world
projects.
  Experiments on ProjBench and CrossCodeEval show that our approach
significantly outperforms existing methods, improving code exact match by
22.72% and identifier exact match by 18.31%. Additionally, integrating our
method with existing baselines boosts code match by 47.80% and identifier match
by 35.55%.

TL;DR: FreeLog提出了一种无需目标系统标签的跨系统日志异常检测方法，解决了冷启动问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖大量标记日志数据，难以在实际中应用，且冷启动问题显著。

Method: 采用系统无关的表示元学习方法FreeLog，无需目标系统标记数据。

Result: 在三个公共日志数据集上，FreeLog性能接近依赖少量标记数据的现有方法。

Conclusion: FreeLog为零标签跨系统日志异常检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Log anomaly detection plays a critical role in ensuring the stability and
reliability of software systems. However, existing approaches rely on large
amounts of labeled log data, which poses significant challenges in real-world
applications. To address this issue, cross-system transfer has been identified
as a key research direction. State-of-the-art cross-system approaches achieve
promising performance with only a few labels from the target system. However,
their reliance on labeled target logs makes them susceptible to the cold-start
problem when labeled logs are insufficient. To overcome this limitation, we
explore a novel yet underexplored setting: zero-label cross-system log anomaly
detection, where the target system logs are entirely unlabeled. To this end, we
propose FreeLog, a system-agnostic representation meta-learning method that
eliminates the need for labeled target system logs, enabling cross-system log
anomaly detection under zero-label conditions. Experimental results on three
public log datasets demonstrate that FreeLog achieves performance comparable to
state-of-the-art methods that rely on a small amount of labeled data from the
target system.

Conclusion: 该方法为业务流程设计提供了一种共享且易于使用的方法。

Abstract: Enterprises are currently undergoing profound transformations due to the
unpostponable digital transformation. Then, to remain competitive, enterprises
must adapt their organisational structures and operations. This organisational
shift is also important for small and medium-sized enterprises. A key
innovation frontier is the adoption of process-oriented production models. This
paper presents a knowledge-based method to support business experts in
designing business processes. The method requires no prior expertise in
Knowledge Engineering and guides designers through a structured sequence of
steps to produce a diagrammatic workflow of the target process. The
construction of the knowledge base starts from simple, text-based, knowledge
artefacts and then progresses towards more structured, formal representations.
The approach has been conceived to allow a shared approach for all stakeholders
and actors who participate in the BP design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统软件开发需要多领域专家协作，复杂且耗时，AgentMesh旨在通过多代理系统自动化这一过程。

Method: 框架包含Planner、Coder、Debugger和Reviewer四个代理，分别负责任务分解、代码实现、调试和验证。

Result: 案例研究表明，AgentMesh能处理复杂开发请求，通过任务规划、代码生成、调试和审查生成最终代码。

Conclusion: 多代理协作能发挥LLM优势并缓解单代理限制，未来需解决错误传播和上下文扩展等问题。

Abstract: Software development is a complex, multi-phase process traditionally
requiring collaboration among individuals with diverse expertise. We propose
AgentMesh, a Python-based framework that uses multiple cooperating LLM-powered
agents to automate software development tasks. In AgentMesh, specialized agents
- a Planner, Coder, Debugger, and Reviewer - work in concert to transform a
high-level requirement into fully realized code. The Planner agent first
decomposes user requests into concrete subtasks; the Coder agent implements
each subtask in code; the Debugger agent tests and fixes the code; and the
Reviewer agent validates the final output for correctness and quality. We
describe the architecture and design of these agents and their communication,
and provide implementation details including prompt strategies and workflow
orchestration. A case study illustrates AgentMesh handling a non-trivial
development request via sequential task planning, code generation, iterative
debugging, and final code review. We discuss how dividing responsibilities
among cooperative agents leverages the strengths of large language models while
mitigating single-agent limitations. Finally, we examine current limitations -
such as error propagation and context scaling - and outline future work toward
more robust, scalable multi-agent AI systems for software engineering
automation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了CrossPL基准，用于评估大语言模型生成跨编程语言互操作代码的能力，发现现有模型在此任务上表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在软件工程中的应用增多，生成跨编程语言互操作代码的能力尚未被充分探索，这对构建复杂系统至关重要。

Method: 通过分析多语言GitHub仓库和开发LLM驱动的流程，构建了包含1,982个任务的CrossPL基准，涵盖6种语言和7种技术。

Result: 评估14种通用大语言模型和6种代码专用模型，发现它们在跨语言互操作场景中表现不佳。

Conclusion: CrossPL基准揭示了当前模型的不足，呼吁更多针对性研究。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly embedded in software
engineering workflows, a critical capability remains underexplored: generating
correct code that enables cross-programming-language (CPL) interoperability.
This skill is essential for building complex systems that integrate components
written in multiple languages via mechanisms like inter-process communication
(IPC). To bridge this gap, we present CrossPL, the first benchmark designed to
systematically evaluate LLMs' ability to generate CPL-interoperating code.
CrossPL comprises 1,982 tasks centered around IPC, covering six widely-used
programming languages and seven representative CPL techniques. We construct
this benchmark by (i) analyzing 19,169 multi-language GitHub repositories using
156 hand-crafted finite state machines (FSMs), and (ii) developing an LLM-based
pipeline that automatically extracts CPL code snippets, generates task
instructions, and validates functional correctness. We evaluate 14
state-of-the-art general-purpose LLMs and 6 code-oriented LLMs released in the
past three years on CrossPL via FSM-based validation. Results reveal that even
the best-performing models struggle with CPL scenarios, underscoring the need
for more targeted research in this space. Our benchmark and code are available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在不同代码偏好场景下，如何最优地结合SFT和DPO以提升LLMs的性能。

Method: 通过理论分析和实验验证，提出APO方法，动态调整训练策略。

Result: APO在六项代表性任务中表现优于或匹配现有SFT和S&D策略。

Conclusion: APO为不同代码偏好对齐场景提供了理论和实践指导。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in
automating software development tasks. While recent advances leverage
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align
models with human preferences, the optimal training strategy remains unclear
across diverse code preference scenarios. This paper systematically
investigates the roles of SFT and DPO in aligning LLMs with different code
preferences. Through both theoretical analysis and empirical observation, we
hypothesize that SFT excels in scenarios with objectively verifiable optimal
solutions, while applying SFT followed by DPO (S&D) enables models to explore
superior solutions in scenarios without objectively verifiable optimal
solutions. Based on the analysis and experimental evidence, we propose Adaptive
Preference Optimization (APO), a dynamic integration approach that adaptively
amplifies preferred responses, suppresses dispreferred ones, and encourages
exploration of potentially superior solutions during training. Extensive
experiments across six representative code preference tasks validate our
theoretical hypotheses and demonstrate that APO consistently matches or
surpasses the performance of existing SFT and S&D strategies. Our work provides
both theoretical foundations and practical guidance for selecting appropriate
training strategies in different code preference alignment scenarios.

TL;DR: 研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在模糊任务描述下的代码生成鲁棒性，发现即使是小问题也会显著降低性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实际任务描述常存在模糊、不完整或矛盾，而现有研究多基于理想条件，需验证LLMs在非理想条件下的表现。

Method: 扩展HumanEval和MBPP基准，通过系统化引入任务描述缺陷，评估不同规模和架构的LLMs。

Result: 任务描述的小瑕疵会导致性能显著下降，矛盾描述易引发逻辑错误；大模型表现更好但仍不完美。

Conclusion: 需开发更鲁棒的LLMs，改进训练策略和评估基准，以适应实际开发中的模糊需求。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in code
generation tasks under idealized conditions, where task descriptions are clear
and precise. However, in practice, task descriptions frequently exhibit
ambiguity, incompleteness, or internal contradictions. In this paper, we
present the first empirical study examining the robustness of state-of-the-art
code generation models when faced with such unclear task descriptions. We
extend the HumanEval and MBPP benchmarks by systematically introducing
realistic task descriptions flaws through guided mutation strategies, producing
a dataset that mirrors the messiness of informal developer instructions. We
evaluate multiple LLMs of varying sizes and architectures, analyzing their
functional correctness and failure modes across task descriptions categories.
Our findings reveal that even minor imperfections in task description phrasing
can cause significant performance degradation, with contradictory task
descriptions resulting in numerous logical errors. Moreover, while larger
models tend to be more resilient than smaller variants, they are not immune to
the challenges posed by unclear requirements. We further analyze semantic error
patterns and identify correlations between description clarity, model behavior,
and error types. Our results underscore the critical need for developing LLMs
that are not only powerful but also robust to the imperfections inherent in
natural user tasks, highlighting important considerations for improving model
training strategies, designing more realistic evaluation benchmarks, and
ensuring reliable deployment in practical software development environments.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在自动漏洞修复（AVR）中的表现是否依赖于训练数据泄漏或完美故障定位等隐藏因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证LLMs是否仅通过记忆人类修复方案来生成补丁，而非真正理解漏洞。

Method: 通过故意偏移漏洞位置，观察LLMs生成的补丁质量是否变化，并采用双LLM流程（生成和审查）及人工审核。

Result: 实验结果将揭示LLMs是否依赖隐藏因素生成补丁。

Conclusion: 研究有助于理解LLMs在AVR中的真实能力及其局限性。

Abstract: Background: Automated Vulnerability Repair (AVR) is a fast-growing branch of
program repair. Recent studies show that large language models (LLMs)
outperform traditional techniques, extending their success beyond code
generation and fault detection.
  Hypothesis: These gains may be driven by hidden factors -- "invisible hands"
such as training-data leakage or perfect fault localization -- that let an LLM
reproduce human-authored fixes for the same code.
  Objective: We replicate prior AVR studies under controlled conditions by
deliberately adding errors to the reported vulnerability location in the
prompt. If LLMs merely regurgitate memorized fixes, both small and large
localization errors should yield the same number of correct patches, because
any offset should divert the model from the original fix.
  Method: Our pipeline repairs vulnerabilities from the Vul4J and VJTrans
benchmarks after shifting the fault location by n lines from the ground truth.
A first LLM generates a patch, a second LLM reviews it, and we validate the
result with regression and proof-of-vulnerability tests. Finally, we manually
audit a sample of patches and estimate the error rate with the
Agresti-Coull-Wilson method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类空间听觉机制启发，旨在通过双耳音频联合检测和定位多声源事件。

Method: 提出BTFF特征表示，包含8个通道，涵盖ITD、ILD和SC等空间线索；开发CRNN模型BiSELDnet。

Result: 在Binaural Set数据集上，系统SELD误差为0.110，F-score为87.1%，定位误差4.4°。

Conclusion: BTFF和BiSELDnet有效模拟人类听觉感知，显著提升任务性能。

Abstract: This paper introduces Binaural Sound Event Localization and Detection
(BiSELD), a task that aims to jointly detect and localize multiple sound events
using binaural audio, inspired by the spatial hearing mechanism of humans. To
support this task, we present a synthetic benchmark dataset, called the
Binaural Set, which simulates realistic auditory scenes using measured
head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) and diverse sound events. To
effectively address the BiSELD task, we propose a new input feature
representation called the Binaural Time-Frequency Feature (BTFF), which encodes
interaural time difference (ITD), interaural level difference (ILD), and
high-frequency spectral cues (SC) from binaural signals. BTFF is composed of
eight channels, including left and right mel-spectrograms, velocity-maps,
SC-maps, and ITD-/ILD-maps, designed to cover different spatial cues across
frequency bands and spatial axes. A CRNN-based model, BiSELDnet, is then
developed to learn both spectro-temporal patterns and HRTF-based localization
cues from BTFF. Experiments on the Binaural Set show that each BTFF sub-feature
enhances task performance: V-map improves detection, ITD-/ILD-maps enable
accurate horizontal localization, and SC-map captures vertical spatial cues.
The final system achieves a SELD error of 0.110 with 87.1% F-score and
4.4{\deg} localization error, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed
framework in mimicking human-like auditory perception.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于关键词的数据增强方法生成的声音不真实，且依赖手动定义标签，难以适应多样化的机器类型和异常模式。现有音频生成模型（如MIMII-Gen）需异常训练数据，限制了其适用性。

Method: 利用LLM解析故障文本描述，自动选择音频转换函数，将正常机器声音转化为多样且合理的异常声音。

Result: 实验表明，合成异常与真实异常在检测难度上趋势一致，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: LLM合成方法为UASD系统的相对评估提供了有效工具。

Abstract: This paper proposes a method for generating machine-type-specific anomalies
to evaluate the relative performance of unsupervised anomalous sound detection
(UASD) systems across different machine types, even in the absence of real
anomaly sound data. Conventional keyword-based data augmentation methods often
produce unrealistic sounds due to their reliance on manually defined labels,
limiting scalability as machine types and anomaly patterns diversify. Advanced
audio generative models, such as MIMII-Gen, show promise but typically depend
on anomalous training data, making them less effective when diverse anomalous
examples are unavailable. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
synthesis approach leveraging large language models (LLMs) to interpret textual
descriptions of faults and automatically select audio transformation functions,
converting normal machine sounds into diverse and plausible anomalous sounds.
We validate this approach by evaluating a UASD system trained only on normal
sounds from five machine types, using both real and synthetic anomaly data.
Experimental results reveal consistent trends in relative detection difficulty
across machine types between synthetic and real anomalies. This finding
supports our hypothesis and highlights the effectiveness of the proposed
LLM-based synthesis approach for relative evaluation of UASD systems.

Abstract: The past decade's "cryoEM revolution" has produced exponential growth in
high-resolution structural data through advances in cryogenic electron
microscopy (cryoEM) and tomography (cryoET). Deep learning integration into
structural proteomics workflows addresses longstanding challenges including low
signal-to-noise ratios, preferred orientation artifacts, and missing-wedge
problems that historically limited efficiency and scalability. This review
examines AI applications across the entire cryoEM pipeline, from automated
particle picking using convolutional neural networks (Topaz, crYOLO,
CryoSegNet) to computational solutions for preferred orientation bias
(spIsoNet, cryoPROS) and advanced denoising algorithms (Topaz-Denoise). In
cryoET, tools like IsoNet employ U-Net architectures for simultaneous
missing-wedge correction and noise reduction, while TomoNet streamlines
subtomogram averaging through AI-driven particle detection. The workflow
culminates with automated atomic model building using sophisticated tools like
ModelAngelo, DeepTracer, and CryoREAD that translate density maps into
interpretable biological structures. These AI-enhanced approaches have achieved
near-atomic resolution reconstructions with minimal manual intervention,
resolved previously intractable datasets suffering from severe orientation
bias, and enabled successful application to diverse biological systems from HIV
virus-like particles to in situ ribosomal complexes. As deep learning evolves,
particularly with large language models and vision transformers, the future
promises sophisticated automation and accessibility in structural biology,
potentially revolutionizing our understanding of macromolecular architecture
and function.

Motivation: 混沌振幅控制算法（CAC）在组合优化问题中表现优异，但其性能对超参数敏感，需高效调优。

Method: 采用组合方法，包含两种调优策略：方法A（顺序优化超参数）和方法B（基于初始评估优先调优）。

Result: 在超级计算机上测试，方法A提升1.47倍，方法B提升1.65倍。

Conclusion: 组合方法有效提升了CIMs中超参数调优的效率。

Abstract: Coherent Ising Machines (CIMs) have recently gained attention as a promising
computing model for solving combinatorial optimization problems. In particular,
the Chaotic Amplitude Control (CAC) algorithm has demonstrated high solution
quality, but its performance is highly sensitive to a large number of
hyperparameters, making efficient tuning essential. In this study, we present
an algorithm portfolio approach for hyperparameter tuning in CIMs employing
Chaotic Amplitude Control with momentum (CACm) algorithm. Our method
incorporates multiple search strategies, enabling flexible and effective
adaptation to the characteristics of the hyperparameter space. Specifically, we
propose two representative tuning methods, Method A and Method B. Method A
optimizes each hyperparameter sequentially with a fixed total number of trials,
while Method B prioritizes hyperparameters based on initial evaluations before
applying Method A in order. Performance evaluations were conducted on the
Supercomputer "Flow" at Nagoya University, using planted Wishart instances and
Time to Solution (TTS) as the evaluation metric. Compared to the baseline
performance with best-known hyperparameters, Method A achieved up to 1.47x
improvement, and Method B achieved up to 1.65x improvement. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm portfolio approach in enhancing
the tuning process for CIMs.

Motivation: 脉冲神经网络因其事件驱动特性具有低能耗优势，但其浮点动态特性更值得关注。现有硬重置方法导致信息损失，而软重置方法对神经元处理过于统一。

Method: 设计了自适应重置神经元，建立输入、输出与重置之间的关联，并整合了简单有效的阈值调整策略。

Result: 在多种数据集上表现出色，同时保持了低能耗优势。

Conclusion: 自适应重置神经元在性能和能耗上取得了平衡，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Spiking neural networks possess the advantage of low energy consumption due
to their event-driven nature. Compared with binary spike outputs, their
inherent floating-point dynamics are more worthy of attention. The threshold
level and reset mode of neurons play a crucial role in determining the number
and timing of spikes. The existing hard reset method causes information loss,
while the improved soft reset method adopts a uniform treatment for neurons. In
response to this, this paper designs an adaptive reset neuron, establishing the
correlation between input, output and reset, and integrating a simple yet
effective threshold adjustment strategy. It achieves excellent performance on
various datasets while maintaining the advantage of low energy consumption.

Abstract: This paper preliminarily investigates the duality between flow matching in
generative models and particle swarm optimization (PSO) in evolutionary
computation. Through theoretical analysis, we reveal the intrinsic connections
between these two approaches in terms of their mathematical formulations and
optimization mechanisms: the vector field learning in flow matching shares
similar mathematical expressions with the velocity update rules in PSO; both
methods follow the fundamental framework of progressive evolution from initial
to target distributions; and both can be formulated as dynamical systems
governed by ordinary differential equations. Our study demonstrates that flow
matching can be viewed as a continuous generalization of PSO, while PSO
provides a discrete implementation of swarm intelligence principles. This
duality understanding establishes a theoretical foundation for developing novel
hybrid algorithms and creates a unified framework for analyzing both methods.
Although this paper only presents preliminary discussions, the revealed
correspondences suggest several promising research directions, including
improving swarm intelligence algorithms based on flow matching principles and
enhancing generative models using swarm intelligence concepts.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统进化算法在多目标组合优化问题中依赖领域知识和参数调优的局限性，利用LLMs的自动启发式生成能力。

Method: 基于SEMO框架，引入PFG技术划分目标空间，利用LLMs生成语义多样的启发式。

Result: MPaGE在性能上优于现有LLM框架，与传统MOEAs竞争，且运行速度更快。

Conclusion: MPaGE通过LLMs和PFG技术的结合，有效提升了多目标优化的效率和多样性。

Abstract: Multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems (MOCOP) frequently arise
in practical applications that require the simultaneous optimization of
conflicting objectives. Although traditional evolutionary algorithms can be
effective, they typically depend on domain knowledge and repeated parameter
tuning, limiting flexibility when applied to unseen MOCOP instances. Recently,
integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into evolutionary computation has
opened new avenues for automatic heuristic generation, using their advanced
language understanding and code synthesis capabilities. Nevertheless, most
existing approaches predominantly focus on single-objective tasks, often
neglecting key considerations such as runtime efficiency and heuristic
diversity in multi-objective settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce
Multi-heuristics for MOCOP via Pareto-Grid-guided Evolution of LLMs (MPaGE), a
novel enhancement of the Simple Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization (SEMO)
framework that leverages LLMs and Pareto Front Grid (PFG) technique. By
partitioning the objective space into grids and retaining top-performing
candidates to guide heuristic generation, MPaGE utilizes LLMs to prioritize
heuristics with semantically distinct logical structures during variation, thus
promoting diversity and mitigating redundancy within the population. Through
extensive evaluations, MPaGE demonstrates superior performance over existing
LLM-based frameworks, and achieves competitive results to traditional
Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs), with significantly faster
runtime. Our code is available at: https://github.com/langkhachhoha/MPaGE.

Conclusion: 该框架为大规模多代理系统提供了理论基础，并展示了序数度量在均衡选择中的实用性。

Abstract: We develop an operator algebraic framework for infinite games with a
continuum of agents and prove that regret based learning dynamics governed by a
noncommutative continuity equation converge to a unique quantal response
equilibrium under mild regularity assumptions. The framework unifies functional
analysis, coarse geometry and game theory by assigning to every game a von
Neumann algebra that represents collective strategy evolution. A reflective
regret operator within this algebra drives the flow of strategy distributions
and its fixed point characterises equilibrium. We introduce the ordinal folding
index, a computable ordinal valued metric that measures the self referential
depth of the dynamics, and show that it bounds the transfinite time needed for
convergence, collapsing to zero on coarsely amenable networks. The theory
yields new invariant subalgebra rigidity results, establishes existence and
uniqueness of envy free and maximin share allocations in continuum economies,
and links analytic properties of regret flows with empirical stability
phenomena in large language models. These contributions supply a rigorous
mathematical foundation for large scale multi agent systems and demonstrate the
utility of ordinal metrics for equilibrium selection.

Conclusion: 本文方法避免了惩罚方法的缺点，提供了直接解决约束问题的新途径，并理论支持了ADMM的收敛性。

Abstract: This work is a companion paper of [8], where the distributed linear-quadratic
problem with fixed communication topology (DFT-LQ) and the sparse feedback LQ
problem (SF-LQ) are formulated into a nonsmooth and nonconvex optimization
problem with affine constraints. Moreover, a penalty approach is considered in
\cite{feng-part1}, and the PALM (proximal alternating linearized minimization)
algorithm is studied with convergence and complexity analysis. In this paper,
we aim to address the inherent drawbacks of the penalty approach, such as the
challenge of tuning the penalty parameter and the risk of introducing spurious
stationary points. Specifically, we first reformulate the SF-LQ problem and the
DFT-LQ problem from an epi-composition function perspective, aiming to solve
the constrained problem directly. Then, from a theoretical viewpoint, we
revisit the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and establish
its convergence to the set of cluster points under certain assumptions. When
these assumptions do not hold, we can effectively utilize alternative
approaches combining subgradient descent with Difference-of-Convex relaxation
methods. In summary, our results enable the direct design of group-sparse
feedback gains with theoretical guarantees, without resorting to convex
surrogates, restrictive structural assumptions, or penalty formulations that
incorporate constraints into the cost function.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种在非凸优化中基于Langevin扩散的自调节温度方法，通过密度依赖的温度调整随机扰动，并证明了其Fokker-Planck方程解的唯一性和SDE的弱解存在性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在非凸优化中，传统方法难以有效应对局部极小值。通过让Langevin扩散的温度依赖于其密度函数，可以更好地适应非凸函数的局部特性。

Method: 构建了一个自调节的Langevin扩散模型，形成Nemytskii类型的平均场SDE。利用Wasserstein次微分理论分析Fokker-Planck方程，并通过Trevisan叠加原理构造SDE的弱解。

Result: 证明了Fokker-Planck方程解的唯一性，并构造了SDE的弱解。最终密度收敛到一个显式表示的Lambert W函数描述的稳态分布。

Conclusion: 该方法为处理非凸优化问题提供了一种新思路，通过自调节温度机制有效应对局部极小值，并证明了其理论可行性。

Abstract: In the context of non-convex optimization, we let the temperature of a
Langevin diffusion to depend on the diffusion's own density function. The
rationale is that the induced density reveals to some extent the landscape
imposed by the non-convex function to be minimized, such that a
density-dependent temperature can provide location-wise random perturbation
that may better react to, for instance, the location and depth of local
minimizers. As the Langevin dynamics is now self-regulated by its own density,
it forms a mean-field stochastic differential equation (SDE) of the Nemytskii
type, distinct from the standard McKean-Vlasov equations. Relying on
Wasserstein subdifferential calculus, we first show that the corresponding
(nonlinear) Fokker-Planck equation has a unique solution. Next, a weak solution
to the SDE is constructed from the solution to the Fokker-Planck equation, by
Trevisan's superposition principle. As time goes to infinity, we further show
that the density induced by the SDE converges to an invariant distribution,
which admits an explicit formula in terms of the Lambert $W$ function.

Conclusion: MountainLion通过多模态、多代理系统为金融交易提供了更高效、可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Cryptocurrency trading is a challenging task requiring the integration of
heterogeneous data from multiple modalities. Traditional deep learning and
reinforcement learning approaches typically demand large training datasets and
encode diverse inputs into numerical representations, often at the cost of
interpretability. Recent progress in large language model (LLM)-based agents
has demonstrated the capacity to process multi-modal data and support complex
investment decision-making. Building on these advances, we present
\textbf{MountainLion}, a multi-modal, multi-agent system for financial trading
that coordinates specialized LLM-based agents to interpret financial data and
generate investment strategies. MountainLion processes textual news,
candlestick charts, and trading signal charts to produce high-quality financial
reports, while also enabling modification of reports and investment
recommendations through data-driven user interaction and question answering. A
central reflection module analyzes historical trading signals and outcomes to
continuously refine decision processes, and the system is capable of real-time
report analysis, summarization, and dynamic adjustment of investment
strategies. Empirical results confirm that MountainLion systematically enriches
technical price triggers with contextual macroeconomic and capital flow
signals, providing a more interpretable, robust, and actionable investment
framework that improves returns and strengthens investor confidence.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度强化学习的解决方案，用于预测和管理用户移动时的接入点切换，以减少频繁切换带来的开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户移动性导致频繁的接入点切换（HO），带来资源分配和释放的开销，需要一种高效的管理方法。

Method: 使用Soft Actor-Critic算法训练深度神经网络作为HO策略，设计了包含HO惩罚的奖励函数，并开发了两种变体：基于用户移动模式的DA观测和基于大尺度衰落历史的HA观测。

Result: 模拟结果显示，连续动作空间的DRL方法比离散空间更具扩展性，HO策略能自动学习在特定时间集中切换以减少开销，响应时间小于0.4毫秒。

Conclusion: 提出的DRL解决方案能有效管理HO，平衡速率和开销，适用于实时操作。

Abstract: In the user-centric cell-free massive MIMO (UC-mMIMO) network scheme, user
mobility necessitates updating the set of serving access points to maintain the
user-centric clustering. Such updates are typically performed through handoff
(HO) operations; however, frequent HOs lead to overheads associated with the
allocation and release of resources. This paper presents a deep reinforcement
learning (DRL)-based solution to predict and manage these connections for
mobile users. Our solution employs the Soft Actor-Critic algorithm, with
continuous action space representation, to train a deep neural network to serve
as the HO policy. We present a novel proposition for a reward function that
integrates a HO penalty in order to balance the attainable rate and the
associated overhead related to HOs. We develop two variants of our system; the
first one uses mobility direction-assisted (DA) observations that are based on
the user movement pattern, while the second one uses history-assisted (HA)
observations that are based on the history of the large-scale fading (LSF).
Simulation results show that our DRL-based continuous action space approach is
more scalable than discrete space counterpart, and that our derived HO policy
automatically learns to gather HOs in specific time slots to minimize the
overhead of initiating HOs. Our solution can also operate in real time with a
response time less than 0.4 ms.

Motivation: 当前AI领域的竞争加剧，新的LLM模型不断发布，但许多研究未考虑这些进展。本研究旨在利用最新模型提升推荐系统性能。

Method: 在LlamaRec框架中用Llama3替换Llama2，保持预处理和训练数据一致，设置随机种子以确保公平比较。

Result: 实验结果显示，ML-100K、Beauty和Games数据集的性能分别平均提升了38.65%、8.69%和8.19%。

Conclusion: 模型替换是一种低成本高效的方法，无需系统结构调整即可显著提升推荐质量，是当前推荐系统的可行改进方案。

Abstract: Recently, competition in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) has
intensified among major technological companies, resulting in the continuous
release of new large-language models (LLMs) that exhibit improved language
understanding and context-based reasoning capabilities. It is expected that
these advances will enable more efficient personalized recommendations in
LLM-based recommendation systems through improved quality of training data and
architectural design. However, many studies have not considered these recent
developments. In this study, it was proposed to improve LLM-based
recommendation systems by replacing Llama2 with Llama3 in the LlamaRec
framework. To ensure a fair comparison, random seed values were set and
identical input data was provided during preprocessing and training. The
experimental results show average performance improvements of 38.65\%, 8.69\%,
and 8.19\% for the ML-100K, Beauty, and Games datasets, respectively, thus
confirming the practicality of this method. Notably, the significant
improvements achieved by model replacement indicate that the recommendation
quality can be improved cost-effectively without the need to make structural
changes to the system. Based on these results, it is our contention that the
proposed approach is a viable solution for improving the performance of current
recommendation systems.

Conclusion: AR-Trip有效解决了旅行推荐中的重复问题，提升了推荐质量。

Abstract: Trip recommendation has emerged as a highly sought-after service over the
past decade. Although current studies significantly understand human intention
consistency, they struggle with undesired repetitive outcomes that need
resolution. We make two pivotal discoveries using statistical analyses and
experimental designs: (1) The occurrence of repetitions is intricately linked
to the models and decoding strategies. (2) During training and decoding, adding
perturbations to logits can reduce repetition. Motivated by these observations,
we introduce AR-Trip (Anti Repetition for Trip Recommendation), which
incorporates a cycle-aware predictor comprising three mechanisms to avoid
duplicate Points-of-Interest (POIs) and demonstrates their effectiveness in
alleviating repetition. Experiments on four public datasets illustrate that
AR-Trip successfully mitigates repetition issues while enhancing precision.

Motivation: 现有推荐系统依赖外部资源（如知识图谱或大语言模型），导致数据依赖和计算开销问题；而无需知识的模型因缺乏增强原语而表现不足。

Method: 提出NodeDiffRec框架，通过扩散技术生成伪物品及交互，并通过去噪偏好建模优化用户偏好。

Result: 在多个数据集和推荐算法上实现SOTA性能，Recall@5和NDCG@5最大提升分别为98.6%和84.0%。

Conclusion: NodeDiffRec无需外部知识即可显著提升推荐性能，为知识无关的推荐系统提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in recommender systems rely on external resources such as
knowledge graphs or large language models to enhance recommendations, which
limit applicability in real-world settings due to data dependency and
computational overhead. Although knowledge-free models are able to bolster
recommendations by direct edge operations as well, the absence of augmentation
primitives drives them to fall short in bridging semantic and structural gaps
as high-quality paradigm substitutes. Unlike existing diffusion-based works
that remodel user-item interactions, this work proposes NodeDiffRec, a
pioneering knowledge-free augmentation framework that enables fine-grained
node-level graph generation for recommendations and expands the scope of
restricted augmentation primitives via diffusion. By synthesizing pseudo-items
and corresponding interactions that align with the underlying distribution for
injection, and further refining user preferences through a denoising preference
modeling process, NodeDiffRec dramatically enhances both semantic diversity and
structural connectivity without external knowledge. Extensive experiments
across diverse datasets and recommendation algorithms demonstrate the
superiority of NodeDiffRec, achieving State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance, with
maximum average performance improvement 98.6% in Recall@5 and 84.0% in NDCG@5
over selected baselines.

Result: 数值实验表明，新方法在传输和湍流问题上，降维模型准确性提高了两个数量级。

Conclusion: 贪婪训练方法显著提升了降维模型的准确性，优于传统仅优化重建误差的方法。

Abstract: Quadratic manifolds for nonintrusive reduced modeling are typically trained
to minimize the reconstruction error on snapshot data, which means that the
error of models fitted to the embedded data in downstream learning steps is
ignored. In contrast, we propose a greedy training procedure that takes into
account both the reconstruction error on the snapshot data and the prediction
error of reduced models fitted to the data. Because our procedure learns
quadratic manifolds with the objective of achieving accurate reduced models, it
avoids oscillatory and other non-smooth embeddings that can hinder learning
accurate reduced models. Numerical experiments on transport and turbulent flow
problems show that quadratic manifolds trained with the proposed greedy
approach lead to reduced models with up to two orders of magnitude higher
accuracy than quadratic manifolds trained with respect to the reconstruction
error alone.

Abstract: The growing demand for robust quantum programming frameworks has unveiled a
critical limitation: current large language model (LLM) based quantum code
assistants heavily rely on remote APIs, introducing challenges related to
privacy, latency, and excessive usage costs. Addressing this gap, we propose
PennyCoder, a novel lightweight framework for quantum code generation,
explicitly designed for local and embedded deployment to enable on-device
quantum programming assistance without external API dependence. PennyCoder
leverages a fine-tuned version of the LLaMA 3.1-8B model, adapted through
parameter-efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) techniques combined with
domain-specific instruction tuning optimized for the specialized syntax and
computational logic of quantum programming in PennyLane, including tasks in
quantum machine learning and quantum reinforcement learning. Unlike prior work
focused on cloud-based quantum code generation, our approach emphasizes
device-native operability while maintaining high model efficacy. We rigorously
evaluated PennyCoder over a comprehensive quantum programming dataset,
achieving 44.3% accuracy with our fine-tuned model (compared to 33.7% for the
base LLaMA 3.1-8B and 40.1% for the RAG-augmented baseline), demonstrating a

Abstract: Hybrid quantum-classical frameworks leverage quantum computing for machine
learning; however, variational quantum circuits (VQCs) are limited by the need
for local measurements. We introduce an adaptive non-local observable (ANO)
paradigm within VQCs for quantum reinforcement learning (QRL), jointly
optimizing circuit parameters and multi-qubit measurements. The ANO-VQC
architecture serves as the function approximator in Deep Q-Network (DQN) and
Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) algorithms. On multiple benchmark
tasks, ANO-VQC agents outperform baseline VQCs. Ablation studies reveal that
adaptive measurements enhance the function space without increasing circuit
depth. Our results demonstrate that adaptive multi-qubit observables can enable
practical quantum advantages in reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Learning the behaviour of chaotic systems remains challenging due to
instability in long-term predictions and difficulties in accurately capturing
invariant statistical properties. While quantum machine learning offers a
promising route to efficiently capture physical properties from
high-dimensional data, its practical deployment is hindered by current hardware
noise and limited scalability. We introduce a quantum-informed machine learning
framework for learning partial differential equations, with an application
focus on chaotic systems. A quantum circuit Born machine is employed to learn
the invariant properties of chaotic dynamical systems, achieving substantial
memory efficiency by representing these complex physical statistics with a
compact set of trainable circuit parameters. This approach reduces the data
storage requirement by over two orders of magnitude compared to the raw
simulation data. The resulting statistical quantum-informed prior is then
incorporated into a Koopman-based auto-regressive model to address issues such
as gradient vanishing or explosion, while maintaining long-term statistical
fidelity. The framework is evaluated on three representative systems: the
Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, two-dimensional Kolmogorov flow and turbulent
channel flow. In all cases, the quantum-informed model achieves superior
performance compared to its classical counterparts without quantum priors. This
hybrid architecture offers a practical route for learning dynamical systems
using near-term quantum hardware.

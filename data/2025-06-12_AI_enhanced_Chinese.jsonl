Our work investigates\nwhether recall can be improved by supplementing text queries with position\ninformation. Specifically, we explore dynamic image partitioning approaches\nthat divide candidates into semantically meaningful regions of interest.\nInstead of querying entire images, users can specify regions they recognize.\nThis enables the use of position constraints while preserving the semantic\ncapabilities of multimodal models. We introduce and evaluate strategies for\nintegrating position constraints into semantic search models and compare them\nagainst static partitioning approaches. Our evaluation highlights both the\npotential and the limitations of sub-region-based search methods using dynamic\npartitioning.

This research presents a novel\nsolution that leverages the Media Pipe Face Mesh framework to identify facial\nlandmarks and extract geometric data for calculating Euler angles, which\ndetermine head orientation in real time. The system tracks 3D facial landmarks\nand uses this data to compute head movements with a focus on accuracy and\nresponsiveness. By studying Euler angles, the system can identify a user's head\norientation with an accuracy of 90\\%, even at a distance of up to four feet.\nThis capability offers significant enhancements for monitoring user\ninteraction, allowing for more immersive and interactive virtual ex-periences.\nThe proposed method shows its reliability in evaluating participant\nattentiveness during online assessments and meetings. Its application goes\nbeyond engagement analysis, potentially providing a means for improving the\nquality of virtual communication, fostering better understanding between\nparticipants, and ensuring a higher level of interaction in digital spaces.\nThis study offers a basis for future developments in enhancing virtual user\nexperiences by integrating real-time facial tracking technologies, paving the\nway for more adaptive and interactive web-based platform.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eMedia Pipe Face Mesh\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u4eba\u8138\u671d\u5411\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u53d6\u9762\u90e8\u51e0\u4f55\u6570\u636e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6b27\u62c9\u89d2\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe\u523090%\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u865a\u62df\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u7528\u6237\u4e92\u52a8\u76d1\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u865a\u62df\u4e92\u52a8\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u5b9e\u65f6\u76d1\u6d4b\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e0e\u4e92\u52a8\u53d8\u5f97\u5c24\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e14\u54cd\u5e94\u8fc5\u901f\u7684\u6280\u672f\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528Media Pipe Face Mesh\u6846\u67b6\u8bc6\u522b\u9762\u90e8\u5173\u952e\u70b9\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u51e0\u4f55\u6570\u636e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6b27\u62c9\u89d2\uff0c\u5b9e\u65f6\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5934\u90e8\u671d\u5411\u3002", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u57284\u82f1\u5c3a\u8ddd\u79bb\u5185\u8bc6\u522b\u5934\u90e8\u671d\u5411\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe90%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u865a\u62df\u4e92\u52a8\u7684\u76d1\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u865a\u62df\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6574\u5408\u5b9e\u65f6\u9762\u90e8\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e92\u52a8\u6027\u3002"}}

However, deploying these fixed models in\nreal-world IoT applications is challenging because different devices possess\nheterogeneous computational and memory resources, making it impossible to\ndeploy a single model across all platforms. Although traditional compression\nmethods, such as pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation, can improve\nefficiency, they become inflexible once applied and cannot adapt to changing\nresource constraints. To address these issues, we propose ReStNet, a Reusable\nand Stitchable Network that dynamically constructs a hybrid network by\nstitching two pre-trained models together. Implementing ReStNet requires\naddressing several key challenges, including how to select the optimal\nstitching points, determine the stitching order of the two pre-trained models,\nand choose an effective fine-tuning strategy. To systematically address these\nchallenges and adapt to varying resource constraints, ReStNet determines the\nstitching point by calculating layer-wise similarity via Centered Kernel\nAlignment (CKA). It then constructs the hybrid model by retaining early layers\nfrom a larger-capacity model and appending deeper layers from a smaller one. To\nfacilitate efficient deployment, only the stitching layer is fine-tuned. This\ndesign enables rapid adaptation to changing budgets while fully leveraging\navailable resources. Moreover, ReStNet supports both homogeneous (CNN-CNN,\nTransformer-Transformer) and heterogeneous (CNN-Transformer) stitching,\nallowing to combine different model families flexibly.

We first consider an instantaneous, non-spatial\nsetting where the global reward is built by two generalized aggregation\noperators: an inner operator that maps the $N$ agents' effort allocations on\nindividual tasks to a task score, and an outer operator that merges the $M$\ntask scores into the global team reward. We prove that the curvature of these\noperators determines whether heterogeneity can increase reward, and that for\nbroad reward families this collapses to a simple convexity test. Next, we ask\nwhat incentivizes heterogeneity to emerge when embodied, time-extended agents\nmust learn an effort allocation policy. To study heterogeneity in such\nsettings, we use multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) as our computational\nparadigm, and introduce Heterogeneous Environment Design (HED), a\ngradient-based algorithm that optimizes the parameter space of underspecified\nMARL environments to find scenarios where heterogeneity is advantageous.\nExperiments in matrix games and an embodied Multi-Goal-Capture environment show\nthat, despite the difference in settings, HED rediscovers the reward regimes\npredicted by our theory to maximize the advantage of heterogeneity, both\nvalidating HED and connecting our theoretical insights to reward design in\nMARL.

However, most existing AV safety evaluation methods are primarily\ndesigned for simple maneuvers such as car-following and lane-changing. While\nsuitable for basic tests, these methods are insufficient for assessing\nhigh-level automation functions deployed in more complex environments. First,\nthese methods typically use crash rate as the evaluation metric, whose accuracy\nheavily depends on the quality and completeness of naturalistic driving\nenvironment data used to estimate scenario probabilities. Such data is often\ndifficult and expensive to collect. Second, when applied to diverse scenarios,\nthese methods suffer from the curse of dimensionality, making large-scale\nevaluation computationally intractable. To address these challenges, this paper\nproposes a novel framework for full-scenario AV safety evaluation. A unified\nmodel is first introduced to standardize the representation of diverse driving\nscenarios. This modeling approach constrains the dimension of most scenarios to\na regular highway setting with three lanes and six surrounding background\nvehicles, significantly reducing dimensionality. To further avoid the\nlimitations of probability-based method, we propose a volume-based evaluation\nmethod that quantifies the proportion of risky scenarios within the entire\nscenario space. For car-following scenarios, we prove that the set of safe\nscenarios is convex under specific settings, enabling exact volume computation.\nExperimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed volume-based\nmethod using both AV behavior models from existing literature and six\nproduction AV models calibrated from field-test trajectory data in the Ultra-AV\ndataset.

This\nresult shows that the convolutional layers can dynamically generalize phonetic\ndependencies beyond lexically-constrained configurations learned by the FC.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08CNN\uff09\u5728\u8bed\u97f3\u6ce2\u5f62\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u8bcd\u6c47\u65e0\u5173\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed5\u8fc7\u5168\u8fde\u63a5\u5c42\uff08FC\uff09\u8f93\u5165\u968f\u673a\u7279\u5f81\u56fe\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08DNNs\uff09\u80fd\u5426\u5728\u8bcd\u6c47\u5b66\u4e60\u4e4b\u5916\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bed\u97f3\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5168\u8fde\u63a5\u5c42\u74f6\u9888\u5bf9\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u751f\u6210CNN\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7f29\u5c0f\u5168\u8fde\u63a5\u5c42\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8f93\u5165\u968f\u673a\u7279\u5f81\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u97f3\u9891\u8f93\u51fa\u4ee5\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5377\u79ef\u5c42\u80fd\u591f\u52a8\u6001\u6cdb\u5316\u8bed\u97f3\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e\u5168\u8fde\u63a5\u5c42\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8bcd\u6c47\u7ea6\u675f\u914d\u7f6e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5377\u79ef\u5c42\u5177\u6709\u8d85\u8d8a\u8bcd\u6c47\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5168\u8fde\u63a5\u5c42\u74f6\u9888\u7684\u7f29\u5c0f\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

By placing LLMs in identical experimental conditions,\nwe evaluate whether their behaviors exhibit the bounded rationality\ncharacteristic of humans.

AI-based perception outputs are inherently\nstochastic, with variability driven by these external factors, while\ntraditional evaluation metrics remain static and event-independent, failing to\ncapture fluctuations in confidence over time. In this work, we introduce the\nPerception Characteristics Distance (PCD) -- a novel evaluation metric that\nquantifies the farthest distance at which an object can be reliably detected,\nincorporating uncertainty in model outputs. To support this, we present the\nSensorRainFall dataset, collected on the Virginia Smart Road using a\nsensor-equipped vehicle (cameras, radar, LiDAR) under controlled daylight-clear\nand daylight-rain scenarios, with precise ground-truth distances to the target\nobjects. Statistical analysis reveals the presence of change points in the\nvariance of detection confidence score with distance. By averaging the PCD\nvalues across a range of detection quality thresholds and probabilistic\nthresholds, we compute the mean PCD (mPCD), which captures the overall\nperception characteristics of a system with respect to detection distance.\nApplying state-of-the-art perception models shows that mPCD captures meaningful\nreliability differences under varying weather conditions -- differences that\nstatic metrics overlook.

However, their inherently non-sequential nature limits their\neffectiveness in long-horizon reasoning tasks at test time. The recently\nproposed Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (MCTD) offers a promising solution by\ncombining diffusion with tree-based search, achieving state-of-the-art\nperformance on complex planning problems. Despite its strengths, our analysis\nshows that MCTD incurs substantial computational overhead due to the sequential\nnature of tree search and the cost of iterative denoising.

Fast-MCTD\nintegrates two techniques: Parallel MCTD, which enables parallel rollouts via\ndelayed tree updates and redundancy-aware selection; and Sparse MCTD, which\nreduces rollout length through trajectory coarsening. Experiments show that\nFast-MCTD achieves up to 100x speedup over standard MCTD while maintaining or\nimproving planning performance.

In essence, all individuals\npossess the autonomy to determine the issues with which they will engage\ndirectly, while for other matters, they may appoint a representative of their\nchoosing. So far, the literature has studied the delegation structures emerging\nin liquid democracy as static. As a result, transitivity defined as the\ncapacity to transfer acquired authority to another entity, has been identified\nas a concern as it would be conducive to unrestrained accumulation of power.\n  Focusing on the implementation of liquid democracy supported by the\nLiquidFeedback software, we propose a novel approach to assessing the influence\nof voting nodes in a transitive delegation graph, taking into account the\nprocess nature of real-world liquid democracy in which delegation and voting\nare distinct and increasingly independent activities. By introducing a novel\nmodel of delegations in liquid democracy, we show how transitivity may in fact\ncontribute to an effective regulation of deliberation influence and\ndecision-making power. While maintaining the one-person, one-vote paradigm for\nall votes cast, the anticipated influence of an agent, to the extent it is\nstemming from transitivity, experiences a precipitous decline following an\nexponential trajectory.\n  In general, it is our objective to move the first steps towards a rigorous\nanalysis of liquid democracy as an adaptive democratic representation process.\nThe adaptivity aspect of liquid democracy has not yet been explored within the\nexisting academic literature despite it being, we believe, one of its most\nimportant features.

Current methods\nfor increasing diversity often only operate at the token-level, paraphrasing\nthe same response. This is problematic because it leads to poor exploration on\nreasoning problems and to unengaging, repetitive conversational agents. To\naddress this we propose Intent Factored Generation (IFG), factorising the\nsampling process into two stages. First, we sample a semantically dense intent,\ne.g., a summary or keywords. Second, we sample the final response conditioning\non both the original prompt and the intent from the first stage.

Additionally, we find that prompting\nthe model to explicitly state its intent for each step of the chain-of-thought\nbefore generating the step is beneficial for reasoning tasks. We demonstrate\nour method's effectiveness across a diverse set of tasks. We show this method\nimproves both pass@k and Reinforcement Learning from Verifier Feedback on maths\nand code tasks. For instruction-tuning, we combine IFG with Direct Preference\nOptimisation to increase conversational diversity without sacrificing reward.\nFinally, we achieve higher diversity while maintaining the quality of\ngenerations on a general language modelling task, using a new dataset of reader\ncomments and news articles that we collect and open-source.

Existing approaches rely heavily on manually\ncurated datasets or proprietary models. To overcome these limitations, we\npropose Lion, an adversarial distillation framework that iteratively refines\ntraining data by identifying and generating challenging instructions, enabling\nstate-of-the-art zero-shot reasoning.

We\ndevelop Learning to Edit (LTE), a framework that enables LLMs to efficiently\nintegrate new knowledge while preserving existing information. LTE leverages\nmeta-learning to improve both real-time and batch knowledge updates.\nFurthermore, we introduce Bridging and Modeling Correlations (BMC), a\nrefinement of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) that explicitly captures\ntoken-level correlations in preference data, leading to superior alignment\nacross QA and mathematical reasoning tasks.

These findings have implications for AI systems designed to\nmodel human reasoning or interact with humans, suggesting that such systems\nshould accommodate explanation-based, potentially non-minimal belief revision\noperators to better align with human cognitive processes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u4eba\u7c7b\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4fe1\u5ff5\u4fee\u6b63\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u7ecf\u5178\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u4fee\u6b63\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u542f\u793a\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u4eba\u7c7b\u5982\u4f55\u6839\u636e\u65b0\u4fe1\u606f\u4fee\u6b63\u4fe1\u5ff5\uff0c\u4ee5\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u63a8\u7406\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u9879\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8003\u5bdf\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u89e3\u91ca\u5f15\u5bfc\u4e0b\u7684\u4fe1\u5ff5\u4fee\u6b63\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u666e\u904d\u504f\u597d\u57fa\u4e8e\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4fe1\u5ff5\u4fee\u6b63\uff0c\u4e14\u8fd9\u79cd\u4fee\u6b63\u4e0d\u4e00\u5b9a\u662f\u7ecf\u5178\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u4fee\u6b63\u3002", "conclusion": "AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e94\u7eb3\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4fe1\u5ff5\u4fee\u6b63\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002"}}

As the diffusion\nmodel has better training robustness than other generative models, it performs\nwell in imitation learning through successful robot demonstrations. However,\nthe diffusion-based policy methods typically require significant time to\niteratively denoise robot actions, which hinders real-time responses in robotic\nmanipulation. Moreover, existing diffusion policies model a time-varying action\ndenoising process, whose temporal complexity increases the difficulty of model\ntraining and leads to suboptimal action accuracy. To generate robot actions\nefficiently and accurately, we present the Time-Unified Diffusion Policy\n(TUDP), which utilizes action recognition capabilities to build a time-unified\ndenoising process. On the one hand, we build a time-unified velocity field in\naction space with additional action discrimination information. By unifying all\ntimesteps of action denoising, our velocity field reduces the difficulty of\npolicy learning and speeds up action generation. On the other hand, we propose\nan action-wise training method, which introduces an action discrimination\nbranch to supply additional action discrimination information. Through\naction-wise training, the TUDP implicitly learns the ability to discern\nsuccessful actions to better denoising accuracy. Our method achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on RLBench with the highest success rate of 82.6%\non a multi-view setup and 83.8% on a single-view setup.

UPQ first quantizes FP16 instruction-tuned\nmodels to INT4 using block-wise PTQ to significantly reduce the quantization\nerror introduced by subsequent INT2 quantization. Next, UPQ applies Distill-QAT\nto enable INT2 instruction-tuned LLMs to generate responses consistent with\ntheir original FP16 counterparts by minimizing the generalized Jensen-Shannon\ndivergence (JSD) between the two.

This ambiguity presents theoretical\nchallenges, as interpersonal trust models may inappropriately ascribe human\nintentionality and morality to AI, while technology trust models were developed\nfor non-social technologies, leaving their applicability to anthropomorphic\nsystems unclear. To address this gap, we investigate how human-like and\nsystem-like trusting beliefs comparatively influence students' perceived\nenjoyment, trusting intention, behavioral intention to use, and perceived\nusefulness of an AI chatbot - factors associated with students' engagement and\nlearning outcomes. Through partial least squares structural equation modeling,\nwe found that human-like and system-like trust significantly influenced student\nperceptions, with varied effects. Human-like trust more strongly predicted\ntrusting intention, while system-like trust better predicted behavioral\nintention and perceived usefulness. Both had similar effects on perceived\nenjoyment. Given the partial explanatory power of each type of trust, we\npropose that students develop a distinct form of trust with AI chatbots\n(human-AI trust) that differs from human-human and human-technology models of\ntrust.

At the same time, SHI is already common in\ncommercial software development, but with potentially different foci. This\nstudy clarifies the extent to which established SHI practices are able to\ncontribute to rAI efforts as well as potential disconnects -- essential\ninsights to inform and tailor future interventions that further shift industry\npractice towards rAI efforts. First, we analysed 56 rAI guidance documents to\nidentify why SHI is recommended (i.e. its expected benefits for rAI) and\nuncovered goals such as redistributing power, improving socio-technical\nunderstandings, anticipating risks, and enhancing public oversight. To\nunderstand why and how SHI is currently practised in commercial settings, we\nthen conducted an online survey (n=130) and semi-structured interviews (n=10)\nwith AI practitioners.

Humans deploy a rich repertoire of linguistic strategies to\nbalance informational and social goals -- from positive approaches that build\nrapport (compliments, expressions of interest) to negative strategies that\nminimize imposition (hedging, indirectness). We investigate whether LLMs employ\na similarly context-sensitive repertoire by comparing human and LLM responses\nin both constrained and open-ended production tasks.

While these models demonstrate strong\ngeneralization and few-shot learning capabilities, they face significant\nchallenges in continually acquiring new skills without forgetting previously\nlearned skills, a problem known as catastrophic forgetting. To address this\nissue, we propose the Analytic Task Scheduler (ATS), a novel framework for\ncontinual learning in embodied foundation models. ATS consists of a\ntask-specific model library, where each model is fine-tuned independently on a\nsingle task, and an analytic scheduler trained using recursive least squares\n(RLS) to learn the mapping between language instructions and task-specific\nmodels. This architecture enables accurate task recognition and dynamic model\nselection while fundamentally avoiding parameter interference across tasks. The\nscheduler updates its parameters incrementally using only statistics\n(autocorrelation and cross-correlation matrices), enabling forgetting-resistant\nlearning without the need to revisit historical data. We validate ATS on a\nreal-world robot platform (RM65B), demonstrating superior resistance to\nforgetting and strong adaptability to task variations.

Recent methods utilizing large language\nmodels (LLMs) have shown remarkable semantic parsing capabilities but are\nlimited by the scarcity of diverse annotated data and multi-hop reasoning\nsamples. Traditional data augmentation approaches are focus mainly on\nsingle-hop questions and prone to semantic distortion, while LLM-based methods\nprimarily address semantic distortion but usually neglect multi-hop reasoning,\nthus limiting data diversity.

Specifically, PGDA-KGQA enriches its training set by:\n(1) generating single-hop pseudo questions to improve the alignment of question\nsemantics with KG relations; (2) applying semantic-preserving question\nrewriting to improve robustness against linguistic variations; (3) employing\nanswer-guided reverse path exploration to create realistic multi-hop questions.\nBy adopting an augment-generate-retrieve semantic parsing pipeline, PGDA-KGQA\nutilizes the augmented data to enhance the accuracy of logical form generation\nand thus improve answer retrieval performance.

However, several methods designed for\nfederated LoRA present significant challenges in balancing communication\nefficiency, model accuracy, and computational cost, particularly among\nheterogeneous clients. These methods either rely on simplistic averaging of\nlocal adapters, which introduces aggregation noise, require transmitting large\nstacked local adapters, leading to poor communication efficiency, or\nnecessitate reconstructing memory-dense global weight-update matrix and\nperforming computationally expensive decomposition to design client-specific\nlow-rank adapters. In this work, we propose FLoRIST, a federated fine-tuning\nframework that achieves mathematically accurate aggregation without incurring\nhigh communication or computational overhead. Instead of constructing the full\nglobal weight-update matrix at the server, FLoRIST employs an efficient\ndecomposition pipeline by performing singular value decomposition on stacked\nlocal adapters separately.

Methods using prior information (i.e., subspace-based methods) have\nshown effective performance by extracting information geometry to detect OOD\ndata with a more appropriate distance metric. However, these methods fail to\naddress the geometry distorted by ill-distributed samples, due to the\nlimitation of statically extracting information geometry from the training\ndistribution. In this paper, we argue that the influence of ill-distributed\nsamples can be corrected by dynamically adjusting the prior geometry in\nresponse to new data. Based on this insight, we propose a novel approach that\ndynamically updates the prior covariance matrix using real-time input features,\nrefining its information.

First, we study dense MRPP on 2D grids, relevant to\nwarehouse and parcel systems. We propose the Rubik Table method, achieving $(1\n+ \\delta)$-optimal makespan (with $\\delta \\in (0, 0.5]$) for up to $\\frac{m_1\nm_2}{2}$ robots, solving large instances efficiently and setting a new\ntheoretical benchmark.\n  Next, we address real-world MRPP.

Training with POET, where both responses in\neach sample are truncated to equal length, resulting in diverse truncated\nlengths across samples, the optimization of DAAs objective is implicitly\nconstrained to converge across all positions, thus paying more attention to\nprefix tokens than the standard DAAs. We conduct experiments with DPO and\nSimPO, two representative DAAs, demonstrating that POET improves over their\nstandard implementations, achieving up to 15.6 points in AlpacaEval 2 and\noverall improvements across downstream tasks.

However, current evaluations of VLAs remain\ninsufficient. Traditional imitation learning benchmarks are unsuitable due to\nthe lack of language instructions. Emerging benchmarks for VLAs that\nincorporate language often come with limited evaluation tasks and do not intend\nto investigate how much VLM pretraining truly contributes to the generalization\ncapabilities of the downstream robotic policy. Meanwhile, much research relies\non real-world robot setups designed in isolation by different institutions,\nwhich creates a barrier for reproducibility and accessibility. To address this\ngap, we introduce a unified probing suite of 50 simulation-based tasks across\n10 subcategories spanning language instruction, vision, and objects. We\nsystematically evaluate several state-of-the-art VLA architectures on this\nsuite to understand their generalization capability. Our results show that\nwhile VLM backbones endow VLAs with robust perceptual understanding and high\nlevel planning, which we refer to as good intentions, this does not reliably\ntranslate into precise motor execution: when faced with out-of-distribution\nobservations, policies often exhibit coherent intentions, but falter in action\nexecution. Moreover, finetuning on action data can erode the original VLM's\ngeneralist reasoning abilities.

As social media becomes central to daily\nlife, digital footprints offer valuable insight into suicidal behavior.\nFocusing on individuals who attempted suicide while uploading videos to their\nchannels, we investigate: How do suicidal behaviors manifest on YouTube, and\nhow do they differ from expert knowledge? We applied complementary approaches:\ncomputational bottom-up, hybrid, and expert-driven top-down, on a novel\nlongitudinal dataset of 181 YouTube channels from individuals with\nlife-threatening attempts, alongside 134 control channels. In the bottom-up\napproach, we applied LLM-based topic modeling to identify behavioral\nindicators. Of 166 topics, five were associated with suicide-attempt, with two\nalso showing temporal attempt-related changes ($p<.01$) - Mental Health\nStruggles ($+0.08$)* and YouTube Engagement ($+0.1$)*. In the hybrid approach,\na clinical expert reviewed LLM-derived topics and flagged 19 as\nsuicide-related. However, none showed significant attempt-related temporal\neffects beyond those identified bottom-up. Notably, YouTube Engagement, a\nplatform-specific indicator, was not flagged by the expert, underscoring the\nvalue of bottom-up discovery. In the top-down approach, psychological\nassessment of suicide attempt narratives revealed that the only significant\ndifference between individuals who attempted before and those attempted during\ntheir upload period was the motivation to share this experience: the former\naimed to Help Others ($\\beta=-1.69$, $p<.01$), while the latter framed it as\npart of their Personal Recovery ($\\beta=1.08$, $p<.01$).

Progress, however, rests on the premise\nthat benchmark scores are both accurate and reproducible. We demonstrate that\nthe reproducibility of LLM performance is fragile: changing system\nconfiguration such as evaluation batch size, GPU count, and GPU version can\nintroduce significant difference in the generated responses. This issue is\nespecially pronounced in reasoning models, where minor rounding differences in\nearly tokens can cascade into divergent chains of thought, ultimately affecting\naccuracy. For instance, under bfloat16 precision with greedy decoding, a\nreasoning model like DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B can exhibit up to 9% variation\nin accuracy and 9,000 tokens difference in response length due to differences\nin GPU count, type, and evaluation batch size. We trace the root cause of this\nvariability to the non-associative nature of floating-point arithmetic under\nlimited numerical precision. This work presents the first systematic\ninvestigation into how numerical precision affects reproducibility in LLM\ninference. Through carefully controlled experiments across various hardware,\nsoftware, and precision settings, we quantify when and how model outputs\ndiverge.

To allow these\npolicies to safely interact with their environments, we need a failure detector\nthat gives a timely alert such that the robot can stop, backtrack, or ask for\nhelp. However, existing failure detectors are trained and tested only on one or\na few specific tasks, while VLAs require the detector to generalize and detect\nfailures also in unseen tasks and novel environments. In this paper, we\nintroduce the multitask failure detection problem and propose SAFE, a failure\ndetector for generalist robot policies such as VLAs. We analyze the VLA feature\nspace and find that VLAs have sufficient high-level knowledge about task\nsuccess and failure, which is generic across different tasks. Based on this\ninsight, we design SAFE to learn from VLA internal features and predict a\nsingle scalar indicating the likelihood of task failure. SAFE is trained on\nboth successful and failed rollouts, and is evaluated on unseen tasks. SAFE is\ncompatible with different policy architectures.

An extensive\nevaluation study has been conducted, using the real-world V2V4Real dataset,\nwhere the proposed method significantly outperforms the baseline frameworks,\nincluding the state-of-the-art deep-learning DMSTrack and V2V4Real, in various\ntesting sequences.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u540c\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e863D LiDAR\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a\u56e0\u906e\u6321\u548c\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6545\u969c\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u5b58\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u6574\u5408\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4fe1\u606f\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u9762\u73af\u5883\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u5168\u8fde\u63a5\u56fe\u62d3\u6251\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u56fe\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5e73\u6ed1\u591a\u8f66\u8f86\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u5206\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5173\u8054\u4f18\u5316\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0e\u8ddf\u8e2a\u3002", "result": "\u5728V2V4Real\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6846\u67b6\u53ca\u5f53\u524d\u5148\u8fdb\u7684DMSTrack\u548cV2V4Real\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u540c\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u56fe\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

Methods: We identified 9,140 cohort of PLWHs from the\nUF Health IDR and performed topic modeling analysis using Latent Dirichlet\nAllocation (LDA) to uncover stigma dimensions, social, and related behavioral\ncircumstances. Domain experts created a seed list of HIV-related stigma\nkeywords, then applied a snowball strategy to iteratively review notes for\nadditional terms until saturation was reached.

This often leads to a set of equally\npossible underlying causal graphs due to information loss from sub-sampling\n(i.e., not observing all possible states of the system throughout time). Our\nresearch addresses this challenge by incorporating the effects of sub-sampling\nin the derivation of causal graphs, resulting in more accurate and intuitive\noutcomes. We use a constraint optimization approach, specifically answer set\nprogramming (ASP), to find the optimal set of answers. ASP not only identifies\nthe most probable underlying graph, but also provides an equivalence class of\npossible graphs for expert selection. In addition, using ASP allows us to\nleverage graph theory to further prune the set of possible solutions, yielding\na smaller, more accurate answer set significantly faster than traditional\napproaches. We validate our approach on both simulated data and empirical\nstructural brain connectivity, and demonstrate its superiority over established\nmethods in these experiments.

In this\npaper, we propose InstructPro, a family of protein generative models that\nfollow natural language instructions to design ligand-binding proteins. Given a\ntextual description of the desired function and a ligand formula in SMILES,\nInstructPro generates protein sequences that are functionally consistent with\nthe specified instructions. We develop the model architecture, training\nstrategy, and a large-scale dataset, InstructProBench, to support both training\nand evaluation. InstructProBench consists of 9,592,829 triples of (function\ndescription, ligand formula, protein sequence). We train two model variants:\nInstructPro-1B (with 1 billion parameters) and InstructPro-3B~(with 3 billion\nparameters). Both variants consistently outperform strong baselines, including\nProGen2, ESM3, and Pinal. Notably, InstructPro-1B achieves the highest docking\nsuccess rate (81.52% at moderate confidence) and the lowest average root mean\nsquare deviation (RMSD) compared to ground truth structures (4.026{\\AA}).\nInstructPro-3B further descreases the average RMSD to 2.527{\\AA}, demonstrating\nInstructPro's ability to generate ligand-binding proteins that align with the\nfunctional specifications.", "AI": {"tldr": "InstructPro\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u4ee4\u8bbe\u8ba1\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u7684AI\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6839\u636e\u529f\u80fd\u63cf\u8ff0\u548c\u914d\u4f53\u516c\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u529f\u80fd\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u591f\u7ed3\u5408\u7279\u5b9a\u914d\u4f53\u7684\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u5728\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u548c\u5316\u5b66\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709AI\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u86cb\u767d\u8d28-\u914d\u4f53\u590d\u5408\u7269\u6570\u636e\u3002\u4eba\u7c7b\u6574\u7406\u7684\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\u6570\u636e\u66f4\u4e3a\u4e30\u5bcc\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u4ee4\u6307\u5bfc\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faInstructPro\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\uff0c\u5305\u62ec1B\u548c3B\u53c2\u6570\u7248\u672c\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u4ee4\u548c\u914d\u4f53SMILES\u516c\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u5e8f\u5217\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6InstructProBench\uff089,592,829\u6761\u6570\u636e\uff09\u652f\u6301\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "InstructPro-1B\u548cInstructPro-3B\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff08ProGen2\u3001ESM3\u3001Pinal\uff09\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dInstructPro-1B\u7684\u5bf9\u63a5\u6210\u529f\u7387\u8fbe81.52%\uff0c\u5e73\u5747RMSD\u4e3a4.026\u00c5\uff1bInstructPro-3B\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5c06RMSD\u964d\u81f32.527\u00c5\u3002", "conclusion": "InstructPro\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u4ee4\u8bbe\u8ba1\u529f\u80fd\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Unlike traditional methods, we propose a novel perspective: CL not only\nneeds to prevent forgetting, but also requires intentional forgetting.This\narises from existing CL methods ignoring biases in real-world data, leading the\nmodel to learn spurious correlations that transfer and amplify across tasks.\nFrom feature extraction and prediction results, we find that data biases\nsimultaneously reduce CL's ability to retain and transfer knowledge. To address\nthis, we propose ErrorEraser, a universal plugin that removes erroneous\nmemories caused by biases in CL, enhancing performance in both new and old\ntasks. ErrorEraser consists of two modules: Error Identification and Error\nErasure. The former learns the probability density distribution of task data in\nthe feature space without prior knowledge, enabling accurate identification of\npotentially biased samples.

Excess VAT is highly correlated with type 2\ndiabetes and insulin resistance. The mechanistic basis for this pathophysiology\nrelates to overloading the liver with fatty acids. VAT is also a highly labile\nfat depot, with increased turnover stimulated by catecholamines during\nexercise. VAT can be measured with sophisticated imaging technologies, but can\nalso be inferred directly from PA. We tested this relationship using National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data from 2011-2014, for\nindividuals aged 20-60 years with 7 days of accelerometry data (n=2,456 men;\n2,427 women) [1]. Two approaches were used for estimating VAT from activity.\nThe first used engineered features based on movements during gait and sleep,\nand then ridge regression to map summary statistics of these features into a\nVAT estimate. The second approach used deep neural networks trained on 24 hours\nof continuous accelerometry. A foundation model first mapped each 10s frame\ninto a high-dimensional feature vector. A transformer model then mapped each\nday's feature vector time series into a VAT estimate, which were averaged over\nmultiple days.

Vision-based absolute\nlocalization methods, which locate the current view of the UAV in a reference\nsatellite map to estimate its position, have become popular in GNSS-denied\nscenarios. However, existing methods mostly rely on traditional and low-level\nimage matching, suffering from difficulties due to significant differences\nintroduced by cross-source discrepancies and temporal variations. To overcome\nthese limitations, in this paper, we introduce a hierarchical cross-source\nimage matching method designed for UAV absolute localization, which integrates\na semantic-aware and structure-constrained coarse matching module with a\nlightweight fine-grained matching module. Specifically, in the coarse matching\nmodule, semantic features derived from a vision foundation model first\nestablish region-level correspondences under semantic and structural\nconstraints. Then, the fine-grained matching module is applied to extract fine\nfeatures and establish pixel-level correspondences. Building upon this, a UAV\nabsolute visual localization pipeline is constructed without any reliance on\nrelative localization techniques, mainly by employing an image retrieval module\nbefore the proposed hierarchical image matching modules.

While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) achieves real-time\nrendering in static settings, extending it to dynamic scenes is challenging due\nto the difficulty of learning structured and temporally consistent motion\nrepresentations. This challenge often manifests as three limitations in\nexisting methods: redundant Gaussian updates, insufficient motion supervision,\nand weak modeling of complex non-rigid deformations.

A self-supervised Induced Flow-Guided\nDeformation module induces anchor motion using multi-frame feature aggregation,\neliminating the need for explicit flow labels. To further handle fine-grained\ndeformations, a Hierarchical Anchor Propagation mechanism increases anchor\nresolution based on motion complexity and propagates multi-level\ntransformations.

Recent advancements in deep learning, specifically diffusion\nmodels (DMs), have sparked significant interest due to their ability to learn\ncomplex data distributions and generate high-fidelity samples, offering a\nrobust framework for unsupervised AD. In this survey, we comprehensively review\nanomaly detection and generation with diffusion models (ADGDM), presenting a\ntutorial-style analysis of the theoretical foundations and practical\nimplementations and spanning images, videos, time series, tabular, and\nmultimodal data. Crucially, unlike existing surveys that often treat anomaly\ndetection and generation as separate problems, we highlight their inherent\nsynergistic relationship. We reveal how DMs enable a reinforcing cycle where\ngeneration techniques directly address the fundamental challenge of anomaly\ndata scarcity, while detection methods provide critical feedback to improve\ngeneration fidelity and relevance, advancing both capabilities beyond their\nindividual potential.

However, previous navigation research is divided into different\ntasks/capabilities, e.g., ObjNav, ImgNav and VLN, where they differ in task\nobjectives and modalities, making datasets and methods are designed\nindividually. In this work, we take steps toward generalist navigation agents,\nwhich can follow free-form instructions that include arbitrary compounds of\nmulti-modal and multi-capability. To achieve this, we propose a large-scale\nbenchmark and corresponding method, termed OctoNav-Bench and OctoNav-R1.\nSpecifically, OctoNav-Bench features continuous environments and is constructed\nvia a designed annotation pipeline. We thoroughly craft instruction-trajectory\npairs, where instructions are diverse in free-form with arbitrary modality and\ncapability. Also, we construct a Think-Before-Action (TBA-CoT) dataset within\nOctoNav-Bench to provide the thinking process behind actions. For OctoNav-R1,\nwe build it upon MLLMs and adapt it to a VLA-type model, which can produce\nlow-level actions solely based on 2D visual observations. Moreover, we design a\nHybrid Training Paradigm (HTP) that consists of three stages, i.e.,\nAction-/TBA-SFT, Nav-GPRO, and Online RL stages.

The key\nchallenge for image-based 3D object detection tasks is the lack of 3D geometric\ncues, which leads to ambiguity in establishing correspondences between images\nand 3D representations. To tackle this problem, 3DGeoDet generates efficient 3D\ngeometric representations in both explicit and implicit manners based on\npredicted depth information. Specifically, we utilize the predicted depth to\nlearn voxel occupancy and optimize the voxelized 3D feature volume explicitly\nthrough the proposed voxel occupancy attention. To further enhance 3D\nawareness, the feature volume is integrated with an implicit 3D representation,\nthe truncated signed distance function (TSDF).

Among various ranking surrogates, Softmax (SM) Loss has been widely\nadopted due to its natural capability to handle listwise ranking via global\nnegative comparisons, along with its flexibility across diverse application\nscenarios. However, despite its effectiveness, SM Loss often suffers from\nsignificant computational overhead and scalability limitations when applied to\nlarge-scale object spaces. To address this challenge, we propose novel loss\nformulations that align directly with ranking metrics: the\nRanking-Generalizable \\textbf{squared} (RG$^2$) Loss and the\nRanking-Generalizable interactive (RG$^\\times$) Loss, both derived through\nTaylor expansions of the SM Loss. Notably, RG$^2$ reveals the intrinsic\nmechanisms underlying weighted squared losses (WSL) in ranking methods and\nuncovers fundamental connections between sampling-based and non-sampling-based\nloss paradigms.

Existing\nmethods typically focus on word-level or local text segment alterations,\noverlooking the broader context, which results in detectable or semantically\ninconsistent perturbations. We propose a novel adversarial text attack scheme\nnamed Dynamic Contextual Perturbation (DCP). DCP dynamically generates\ncontext-aware perturbations across sentences, paragraphs, and documents,\nensuring semantic fidelity and fluency. Leveraging the capabilities of\npre-trained language models, DCP iteratively refines perturbations through an\nadversarial objective function that balances the dual objectives of inducing\nmodel misclassification and preserving the naturalness of the text. This\ncomprehensive approach allows DCP to produce more sophisticated and effective\nadversarial examples that better mimic natural language patterns.

However, achieving stable, long-range\nautoregressive forecasts beyond a few weeks remains a significant challenge.\nPrevailing state-of-the-art models that achieve year-long stability, such as\nSFNO and DLWP-HPX, have relied on transforming input data onto non-standard\nspatial domains like spherical harmonics or HEALPix meshes. This has led to the\nprevailing assumption that such representations are necessary to enforce\nphysical consistency and long-term stability. This paper challenges that\nassumption by investigating whether comparable long-range performance can be\nachieved on the standard latitude-longitude grid. We introduce AtmosMJ, a deep\nconvolutional network that operates directly on ERA5 data without any spherical\nremapping. The model's stability is enabled by a novel Gated Residual Fusion\n(GRF) mechanism, which adaptively moderates feature updates to prevent error\naccumulation over long recursive simulations. Our results demonstrate that\nAtmosMJ produces stable and physically plausible forecasts for about 500 days.\nIn quantitative evaluations, it achieves competitive 10-day forecast accuracy\nagainst models like Pangu-Weather and GraphCast, all while requiring a\nremarkably low training budget of 5.7 days on a V100 GPU.

This study\nintroduces a novel ME dataset, MMME, which, for the first time, enables\nsynchronized collection of facial action signals (MEs), central nervous system\nsignals (EEG), and peripheral PS (PPG, RSP, SKT, EDA, and ECG).

Extensive experiments validate the\ndataset's reliability and provide benchmarks for ME analysis, demonstrating\nthat integrating MEs with PS significantly enhances recognition and spotting\nperformance. To the best of our knowledge, MMME is the most comprehensive ME\ndataset to date in terms of modality diversity.

This task remains fundamentally\nchallenging, as it requires inferring 3D structure from incomplete and\nambiguous 2D observations. Early approaches typically rely on strong 3D\nknowledge, including architectural 3D inductive biases (e.g., embedding\nexplicit 3D representations, such as NeRF or 3DGS, into network design) and\nground-truth camera poses for both input and target views. While recent efforts\nhave sought to reduce the 3D inductive bias or the dependence on known camera\nposes of input views, critical questions regarding the role of 3D knowledge and\nthe necessity of circumventing its use remain under-explored. In this work, we\nconduct a systematic analysis on the 3D knowledge and uncover a critical trend:\nthe performance of methods that requires less 3D knowledge accelerates more as\ndata scales, eventually achieving performance on par with their 3D\nknowledge-driven counterparts, which highlights the increasing importance of\nreducing dependence on 3D knowledge in the era of large-scale data. Motivated\nby and following this trend, we propose a novel NVS framework that minimizes 3D\ninductive bias and pose dependence for both input and target views. By\neliminating this 3D knowledge, our method fully leverages data scaling and\nlearns implicit 3D awareness directly from sparse 2D images, without any 3D\ninductive bias or pose annotation during training. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our model generates photorealistic and 3D-consistent novel\nviews, achieving even comparable performance with methods that rely on posed\ninputs, thereby validating the feasibility and effectiveness of our\ndata-centric paradigm.

The dielectric behaviour of oils,\ngoverned by their molecular composition, induces distinct shifts in the\nsensor's resonant frequency and amplitude response. These variations are\nsystematically captured and processed to extract salient features, which serve\nas inputs for multiple machine learning classifiers. The microwave resonant\nsensor operates in a non-destructive, low-power manner, making it particularly\nwell-suited for real-time industrial applications. A comprehensive dataset is\ndeveloped by varying the permittivity of oil samples and acquiring the\ncorresponding sensor responses.

We propose LEO-VL, a 3D-VL model built upon condensed\nfeature grid (CFG), an efficient scene representation that bridges 2D\nperception and 3D spatial structure while significantly reducing token\noverhead. This efficiency unlocks large-scale training towards 3D-VL\ngeneralist, for which we curate over 700k high-quality 3D-VL data spanning four\ndomains of real-world indoor scenes and five tasks such as captioning and\ndialogue. LEO-VL achieves state-of-the-art performance on a variety of 3D QA\nbenchmarks, including SQA3D, MSQA, and Beacon3D.

However,\nexisting methods primarily approach multimodal reasoning in a straightforward,\ntext-centric manner, where both reasoning and answer derivation are conducted\npurely through text, with the only difference being the presence of multimodal\ninput. As a result, these methods often encounter fundamental limitations in\nspatial reasoning tasks that demand precise geometric understanding and\ncontinuous spatial tracking-capabilities that humans achieve through mental\nvisualization and manipulation. To address the limitations, we propose drawing\nto reason in space, a novel paradigm that enables LVLMs to reason through\nelementary drawing operations in the visual space. By equipping models with\nbasic drawing operations, including annotating bounding boxes and drawing\nauxiliary lines, we empower them to express and analyze spatial relationships\nthrough direct visual manipulation, meanwhile avoiding the performance ceiling\nimposed by specialized perception tools in previous tool-integrated reasoning\napproaches. To cultivate this capability, we develop a three-stage training\nframework: cold-start training with synthetic data to establish basic drawing\nabilities, reflective rejection sampling to enhance self-reflection behaviors,\nand reinforcement learning to directly optimize for target rewards. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our model, named VILASR, consistently outperforms\nexisting methods across diverse spatial reasoning benchmarks, involving maze\nnavigation, static spatial reasoning, video-based reasoning, and\nmulti-view-based reasoning tasks, with an average improvement of 18.4%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u7ed8\u56fe\u64cd\u4f5c\u589e\u5f3a\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u8fc7\u4e8e\u4f9d\u8d56\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u9700\u8981\u7cbe\u786e\u51e0\u4f55\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u7a7a\u95f4\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u672c\u7ed8\u56fe\u64cd\u4f5c\uff08\u5982\u6807\u6ce8\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\u548c\u7ed8\u5236\u8f85\u52a9\u7ebf\uff09\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff08\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u53cd\u5c04\u62d2\u7edd\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6a21\u578bVILASR\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5e73\u5747\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u4e8618.4%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u8868\u8fbe\u548c\u5206\u6790\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u5fc3\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

Traditional HDC methods, while robust to noise and\ninherently parallel, rely on single-pass, non-parametric training and often\nsuffer from low accuracy. To address this, recent approaches adopt iterative\ntraining of base and class HVs, typically accelerated on GPUs. Inference,\nhowever, remains lightweight and well-suited for real-time execution. Yet,\nefficient HDC inference has been studied almost exclusively on specialized\nhardware such as FPGAs and GPUs, with limited attention to general-purpose\nmulti-core CPUs. To address this gap, we propose ScalableHD for scalable and\nhigh-throughput HDC inference on multi-core CPUs. ScalableHD employs a\ntwo-stage pipelined execution model, where each stage is parallelized across\ncores and processes chunks of base and class HVs.

Differential Privacy (DP) offers formal\nprotection, but achieving a favourable utility-privacy trade-off remains\nchallenging. Recent works explore deep learning-based generative models to\nproduce synthetic trajectories. However, current models lack formal privacy\nguarantees and rely on conditional information derived from real data during\ngeneration. This work investigates the utility cost of enforcing DP in such\nmodels, addressing three research questions across two datasets and eleven\nutility metrics. (1) We evaluate how DP-SGD, the standard DP training method\nfor deep learning, affects the utility of state-of-the-art generative models.\n(2) Since DP-SGD is limited to unconditional models, we propose a novel DP\nmechanism for conditional generation that provides formal guarantees and assess\nits impact on utility. (3) We analyse how model types - Diffusion, VAE, and GAN\n- affect the utility-privacy trade-off. Our results show that DP-SGD\nsignificantly impacts performance, although some utility remains if the\ndatasets is sufficiently large. The proposed DP mechanism improves training\nstability, particularly when combined with DP-SGD, for unstable models such as\nGANs and on smaller datasets. Diffusion models yield the best utility without\nguarantees, but with DP-SGD, GANs perform best, indicating that the best\nnon-private model is not necessarily optimal when targeting formal guarantees.\nIn conclusion, DP trajectory generation remains a challenging task, and formal\nguarantees are currently only feasible with large datasets and in constrained\nuse cases.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u8f68\u8ff9\u65f6\u5982\u4f55\u5e73\u8861\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\uff08\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\uff09\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7528\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684DP\u673a\u5236\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\u5305\u542b\u654f\u611f\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6b63\u5f0f\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\uff0c\u9700\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u7ef4\u6301\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7528\u3002", "method": "1. \u8bc4\u4f30DP-SGD\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7528\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b2. \u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684DP\u673a\u5236\u7528\u4e8e\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\uff1b3. \u6bd4\u8f83Diffusion\u3001VAE\u548cGAN\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6548\u7528-\u9690\u79c1\u6743\u8861\u3002", "result": "DP-SGD\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u5927\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0b\u4ecd\u4fdd\u7559\u90e8\u5206\u6548\u7528\uff1b\u65b0DP\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff1bDiffusion\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u4f46GAN\u5728DP-SGD\u4e0b\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "DP\u8f68\u8ff9\u751f\u6210\u4ecd\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u6b63\u5f0f\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u4ec5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u53d7\u9650\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

The thermodynamics exam is a difficult hurdle for most\nstudents, where they must show that they have mastered the fundamentals of this\nimportant topic. Consequently, the failure rates are very high, A-grades are\nrare - and they are considered proof of the students' exceptional intellectual\nabilities. This is because pattern learning does not help in the exam. The\nproblems can only be solved by knowledgeably and creatively combining\nprinciples of thermodynamics. We have given our latest thermodynamics exam not\nonly to the students but also to OpenAI's most powerful reasoning model, o3,\nand have assessed the answers of o3 exactly the same way as those of the\nstudents.

Recent research demonstrates that attackers can\nefficiently exploit system vulnerabilities during the training phase to execute\nbackdoor attacks, producing malicious actions when specific trigger patterns\nare present in the state observations. However, most existing backdoor attacks\nrely primarily on simplistic and heuristic trigger configurations, overlooking\nthe potential efficacy of trigger optimization. To address this gap, we\nintroduce TooBadRL (Trigger Optimization to Boost Effectiveness of Backdoor\nAttacks on DRL), the first framework to systematically optimize DRL backdoor\ntriggers along three critical axes, i.e., temporal, spatial, and magnitude.\nSpecifically, we first introduce a performance-aware adaptive freezing\nmechanism for injection timing. Then, we formulate dimension selection as a\ncooperative game, utilizing Shapley value analysis to identify the most\ninfluential state variable for the injection dimension.

We\nthen establish finite-sample guarantees in Wasserstein-2 distance that exhibit\ntwo key features: (i) they characterize and quantify the robustness of DDPMs to\nnoisy score estimates, and (ii) they achieve faster convergence rates than\npreviously known results.

This complex\ninterplay leads to a wide variety of karst network patterns, each intricately\nlinked to specific hydrogeological conditions. We explore a novel approach that\nrepresents karst networks as graphs and applies graph generative models (deep\nlearning techniques) to capture the intricate nature of karst environments. In\nthis representation, nodes retain spatial information and properties, while\nedges signify connections between nodes. Our generative process consists of two\nmain steps. First, we utilize graph recurrent neural networks (GraphRNN) to\nlearn the topological distribution of karst networks. GraphRNN decomposes the\ngraph simulation into a sequential generation of nodes and edges, informed by\npreviously generated structures. Second, we employ denoising diffusion\nprobabilistic models on graphs (G-DDPM) to learn node features (spatial\ncoordinates and other properties). G-DDPMs enable the generation of nodes\nfeatures on the graphs produced by the GraphRNN that adhere to the learned\nstatistical properties by sampling from the derived probability distribution,\nensuring that the generated graphs are realistic and capture the essential\nfeatures of the original data. We test our approach using real-world karst\nnetworks and compare generated subgraphs with actual subgraphs from the\ndatabase, by using geometry and topology metrics. Our methodology allows\nstochastic simulation of discrete karst networks across various types of\nformations, a useful tool for studying the behavior of physical processes such\nas flow and transport.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u590d\u6742\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u5ca9\u6eb6\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u56fe\u5faa\u73af\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u53bb\u566a\u6269\u6563\u6982\u7387\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u7684\u5ca9\u6eb6\u7f51\u7edc\u56fe\u3002", "motivation": "\u5ca9\u6eb6\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u6c34\u6587\u5730\u8d28\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u7d27\u5bc6\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u6a21\u62df\u5176\u79bb\u6563\u7f51\u7edc\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u56fe\u5faa\u73af\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08GraphRNN\uff09\u5b66\u4e60\u5ca9\u6eb6\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u518d\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u53bb\u566a\u6269\u6563\u6982\u7387\u6a21\u578b\uff08G-DDPM\uff09\u5b66\u4e60\u8282\u70b9\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u6027\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u56fe\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u771f\u5b9e\u5ca9\u6eb6\u7f51\u7edc\u6570\u636e\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5b50\u56fe\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u5b50\u56fe\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u62d3\u6251\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u968f\u673a\u6a21\u62df\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u5ca9\u6eb6\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u7269\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08\u5982\u6d41\u52a8\u548c\u4f20\u8f93\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}
